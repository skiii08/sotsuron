The Blair Witch Project," Shocked and Horrified!
","(Spoilers! (really))Shocked - by the hype - after seeing the film, a month or so ago.Three kids lost in a small wooded area, eager to argue with each other, never able to detach themselves from their camera equipment, unable to stick together even on watch, and so on. It's so bad, hey - it MUST be some sort of satire (that seems the excuse for other silly movies in reviews on imdb).They don't need the cameras, they don't need a map, they don't need a compass. Take the film you've got, travel light if you think you're being stalked, and head back to the car (remember where you put it?). Follow the sun? And so on. It's nuts.End of the film I literally shrugged my shoulders, involuntarily, not from horror or fear - but disbelief. What the HECK was that? I asked myself. I could see in the dimly lit multi-plex, the others just shaking themselves awake, seemed to be having similar thoughts - perhaps similar to the person who walked right out in the middle of the lost in the woods scene (sorry - one of the lost in the woods in the day time scenes, as opposed to the scary lost in the woods in the night time scenes).I was so . . miffed, I haven't been eager to see another theatrical release since. Once burned, right?I wonder how soon it will be before the 'executive decisions' are made to try the hype again? In for a few thou, in for another few thou? Hey - maybe Blair Witch II - the finding of the film cannisters. Or, Ernest Goes to Camp, in the woods, with a compass - and gets lost. Sundance Festival runner-up. A true watershed in filmolological history. No music. Makes it even better. And Ernest does something truly unique, by shooting macro lens close-ups of his imbecilic features and whispering aloud - 'I'm reaallly scared, I've never been so scared.' And so would we be.",Null,0,0,12 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Truly a lousy film
","Spoilers! (for effects(s), of course)Posted a review the other week, but I guess it never took. So, with about a week between me and having gotten a full refund for the film, I'll try to remember the important points.First, the film is lousy - barely even a movie. It's more like a series of disconnected special effects masters, just to see what the gee-whiz guys could do. The documentary that precedes this film on video is a tribute to the gee-whiz guys, and 'I could sit through that scene 25 times and not see all the effects'. Great.But a movie is more than just - special effects. I wasn't the biggest fan of the first Star Wars. And I've heard people walked out of that film when it first opened. But I will give due credit to the actors, the story, the dialogue, the pacing and direction, and the special effects. Harrison Ford's role was crucial. Alec Guinness was very good. And Yoda seemed more Yoda back then (in the 'future') than in this prequel. Sure, Mark Hamell and Carrie Fisher were as annoying as the boy and the puppet in this movie. But Vader was a threat - a menace. This poor painted guy Maul gets mauled like he didn't even matter. Some apprentice. Credit to this movie, though, for that last fight scene. Between that and the pod race, the highlight of the movie.An effects movie could work as a chase movie. Last part of Jurassic, and T2, Aliens, even Raiders, were effects laden orchestrated movie long chases, with appropriate pauses in the action. You don't need plot. You don't need characters - though particularly in Aliens and Raiders you could root for some of the good guys for their quick and resourceful actions, and to the extent that proved their mettle and heroism. This could have worked just like that. But Lucas has this big 'force be with you' nonsense going on, so we're treated to Babylon 5, instead. You've got the hairdos, the early B5 unconvincing latex, the convoluted power struggles, the Narns, the Centari, er . . the Nadoo (?) - heck even ET at one point (a little joke by Lucas). Unlike B5, however, the scope is missing. It's more like Voyager or the Simpsons, where the universe is populated by just a few characters you know.
Since they have the B5 look, the comparison is fair. B5 had huge fleets, and interesting plots within plots - even a sort of believable 'force', more so than in Star Wars. They had good acting, a large ensemble cast, because they had a lot of narrative. Lucas has a lot of narrative, a few actors, poor acting, or just lousy direction. As for the fleets, in this Star Wars, the great battle is between may 1000 on either side (tiny armies), thought they claim 4000. And if they could create the underwater shielding, why couldn't they build a few trucks to carry it on, instead of giant elephants or whatever, and why couldn't they modify it so that one didn't just walk on through? as when underwater. And why didn't they have a spare? Why - oh why?I didn't mention the annoying sidekick. Jar Jar Binks is alternately CGI, model, stop motion claymation (looks just like it), and full size claymation (it seems at times). What a weird dude. And he seems the only 'Gungan' that walks with such an exaggerated style. And his pigeon English could easily seem offensive - but to whom (Italians? Blacks? Asians? etc?). Both whatever mockery and the annoyance were likely unintended, and unseen, by the 'master' - Lucas. He prob. just thought it funny. Ha-ha. The special effects in the first Star Wars were more convincing. And whatever happened to those roll up Robocop type robots? Even if the droids seem feather light and weak, here, those roll-ups would have seemed a tad more effective than the 'storm troopers'.It was a kid's film, like the third Star Wars, with the Ewoks, was a kid's film in the last scenes, particularly. I won't get into the symbolism of the long valleys, the tunnel, the fire exploding out of the tunnel, the pitch of the puppet being somewhere between Homer's derisive falsetto and a little old lady high on caffeine, and just so on. Again, it's all prob. either coincidence or unintended. The film is just bad - on its own - unless you like effects (and those ARE good).Don't buy - don't rent - don't see - unless you have some time to kill by perpetually asking - gee, how'd they do that?",Null,0,1,10 May 2000
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Unexpected classic!
","Spoilers!One of the greats of cinema. Without question, one of the greatest films ever made, probably surprising the heck out of the producer and director, behind it - who were shooting for a . . . 'B' movie.Harrison Ford breaks out of Han Solo into a character even shadier, at times, and even more resourceful (I'm just making it up as I go along). They had signed Tom Selleck. But Ford didn't joke around - unlike in later Raiders films. He had an edge, maybe honed from years as the tv bad guy gunslinger on Gunsmoke, and the like. He was everyman, but not the '80s man. He was tough. And if Star Wars didn't make him a star - though it basically did - then seeing him spin around and disarm the guy about to shoot him in the back, using only a whip, marked the beginning of Harrison Ford, superstar.The score is Oscar calliber, and really contributes overall to the film. The direction is generally very crisp and the 'flow' just about right. Nice editing. There's humor in the film, but the characters aren't prostituted for the sake of cheap jokes. One might argue the introduction of Marion is little unbelievable, maybe even a bit long. But it's difficult to find an extraneous scene, or a needless movement, in this. From start to finish, it's quick cut, the action follows logically, and even the obv plot holes (Indy hanging on the sub, for ex) are forgotten with the next astonishing scene. However much Speilberg, Lucas and others may have thought it was all a hodgepodge of 'great ideas' that they'd always 'wanted to do', that these were just 'intended' to be B movies, the film is well crafted, well thought out, with convincing bad guys, with the sense of real threat and danger to the heroes, with competent allies (not buffoons), and with a prize at the end of the quest of which is certainly worth standing in awe.Marion, maybe because Allen was so striking on screen herself, was actually an interesting character, even though she's in hysterics much of the time. She had a feel for a kind of bratty banter that the 'classier dames' of subsequent films couldn't match. One could identify with her, in the jokes (as with the frying pan to the head), and in the serious moments, with the fire blowing past them tied to that pole. She was the girl next door, embarked on an adventure she never anticipated from a life she never wanted. but who distinguished herself with honor, nonetheless. Indy knew what he was in for. Not her.There was also a sense of discovery, absent in the next films. It was new. This stuff was something to cheer, to be interested in. Take a moment to take it in. Cairo! - Rhys-Davies, shouts. And it is an interesting roof top view and setting. But he's not a jokester. He says it with a calm pride. There's the sub pens. There's the German flying wing, full on aircraft, that goes spectacularly - boom! There's the thing with the red line and the map, that became the cliche - where in the world are we now, kind of thing. We see the map room, a remarkable set, and the well of souls, equally remarkable, and the sunset above. The presence of the supernatural is also there, throughout, from that beam in the map room, to the burning off of the swastika on the crate, to even Belloc's challenge - blow it up! - which he knew Indy could never do. It's bright - lots of scenes out in the sunlight, lots of bright, non-colored, natural looking lighting. Not exactly Blade Runner (which was another good H. Ford film, in its own right). It's bright, it's new, there's something going on here, it's . . . a movie.And it's important to remember the plot. They find the Ark, fairly early on. It's supernatural. So it's supernaturally dangerous, conceivably, a supernatural weapon in the wrong hands - though that's never really explained; and we see what happens at the end to the bad guys, who have the Ark. But, before that, at some level, we can imagine there's a risk if it falls into Nazi hands. We suspend belief. And so, a good portion of the movie is the Ark chase. We know why it's important. We understand the prize. There's no question about what the movie is about, and where it's going - possession of the Ark, the US or Germany its destination. Maybe in that it really is clear-cut, like the serials they were copying. It's sort of like a James Bond, some secret agent, with the amplified, domesday, supernatural destructo ray in his car, trying to get back to England and avoid the evil goons of the evil warlord. Cause we can't let them have the weapon. The movie makes sense, even if some of the scenes don't always. There's the urgency that the Ark not fall into the wrong hands. And to that there's no question. What Ark? THAT Ark. You see, the one in the big box. That Ark, right there. We have to put it in our truck, or they'll put it on their truck. Just that simple. And I think something that simple was lost in subsequent Raiders efforts, as well. So, too, for a few reasons you can call it a computer game plot, if you like. But a real computer game plot, as in subsequent efforts, or say in The Phantom Menance, are far less worthy and satisfying and very different than what Lucas and Spielberg achieved in Raiders of the Lost Ark.",Null,0,0,6 August 2000
United 93," Documentary style - but a bit too film-school
","This film will move you for what certain points in the film symbolize. We know how it ends, yes. But I confess to a tear as the final cards rolled explaining what happened, in brief. The same about midway through the film as they were about to cut to the 93 cabin, even in the boarding area as the terrorists sit right next to the other passengers.There are flaws in the film-making. The Blair Witch tussle-with-the-camera 'realism' is slightly overdone at the FAA center when the goofy and incompetent Air Force liaison is brought in at one point. There's one or two other points in the film, as well. The 'realism' is also had by some improv, and people stumbling over their lines, just 'as in real life'. But it doesn't play in film, in my opinion. Dirty Harry, NYPD Blue, had this sort of indy camera work. But the actors crisply delivered their lines, without stumbling over them. And that made for 'realism'. People know that these, and this movie, are a staged show - lights, camera, action. That's exactly what you don't want to remind them. They should not necessarily have scripted more. I mean, Sliney (not mentioned in IMDb cast list as of 30 APR 2006) knew what he said and did at the time. That's fine. But he and others should have run through the delivery at bit, first; a couple of takes at least. It takes one out of the film when the gal at Northwest Air Defense (NEADS), who is always feeding the officers bad info, seems to almost be looking into the camera as she muffs her lines.The first bit of the film, people boarding 93, the cuts to the FAA center and NEADS, really do have a documentary feel. You can suspend disbelief. Every now and then, these problems, just mentioned, pop right before you on the screen. But the bit before they really concentrate on the cabin drama is interesting, and sickening really. NEADS is portrayed as being just completely clueless. The FAA is on top of things. And local flight controllers, more like the military, just can't seem to believe what they are seeing and hearing in the transmissions. Everything just happens so fast that bureaucracy is slow to act. Some behave, as we're led to believe they actually did, as if they had all day to make decisions.So Air Defense has an air 'scenario' planned for that day, up in the North Atlantic. Plenty of planes to go. But there are no planes in the air. When completely misinformed about what is going on, they still turn on the TV to see CNN broadcasting the smoke from the first WTC tower. And they are told - that's a small plane. They cut to Sliney at FAA and he says - look at that damage. There's no way that's a small aircraft. Where's our American 11? Umm . . that has to be American 11. I don't know the actual story. But according to Sliney, the FAA didn't miss a beat. So in real life, if that's the truth, the military was clueless because the FAA relied upon this incompetent liaison who seemed not to know what to do without his papers to push and pen nearby. The fact is, it didn't occur to anyone at FAA to simply pick up the phone, and call NEADS. Sliney - this is Sliney. We're convinced that's American 11 in the side of the WTC. We're tracking up to ten other possible hijacks at this very minute (they brought out a white board in the control center, and began listing suspicious flights). What are you going to do? But he never made that call. Heck with the liaison. Get him another another donut and some coffee, and make the call yourself.So they get to the plane. The cockpit door is pretty much swinging open all the time. But when the hijackers do attack, the door is closed. They force a stewardess to give the 'secret knock', co-pilot opens the door, and he's attacked and wounded with a knife. The captain, with his lunch tray over his lap, fights back with his arms. But he's quickly done. And the stu is killed. The terrorists get control of the plunging aircraft. And two others herd the passengers, and other stewardesses, to the back of coach, but not before attacking one or two that had been in first class, sitting with them.The reason these passengers hesitate is because they imagine that the hijackers will just land in Cuba, or something. And they'll be freed. One man insists on that explanation. And he's just not going to be wrong. Apparently he's in this scenario because he, too, was on a phone. Ultimately, Greenglass has the passengers literally putting this know-it-all down, before they rush the two hijackers in the coach cabin. The other reason they hesitate is because one hijacker appears to have plastic explosive rigged to some lantern batteries, which was probably also described in phone calls. Turns out, the explosive is just modeling clay. But that holds them in check.Finally they make the rush, first getting the modeling clay guy. Then they get this kid who viciously had been attacking passengers with his knife. He goes down. Then with the cart they literally start poking holes in the cockpit door. They are about to break through when the co-pilot terrorist crashes the plane into the field.It's the story of the passenger's selfless heroism; and dueling religions in the film, as the passengers resort to Hail Marys and Our Fathers, and the terrorists their prayers to Allah. Some might give a bad review to the film because it might be seen to encourage resolve in Afganistan, and Iraq. And that's not their politics. While the film is flawed, it's a film worth seeing, as many of the passenger's families have recommended.",Null,2,6,30 April 2006
Se7en," Strange and inconsistent
","Pitt is miscast. This film is supposedly about a killer finding victims to 'hash' with the seven deadly sins. It's still a rather arbitrary selection. The killer is almost supernaturally agile. When we discover it's Spacey, the audience says - huh? But somehow we believe him in the role, and forget about the agility earlier on. But not Pitt. Freeman narrates (as he does in films) with his dialog to try to paint Pitt as impulsive. But Pitt's character is controlled, and insecure. He's more worried about how people see him than he is to run into a burning building to save a puppy. While Pacino would have been too old to play 'the kid', someone more like Pacino would have been better; nervy, neurotic, quick to assume, etc.They get a lead on Spacey, after figuring out they have a cluster of serial murders to begin with, by saying to themselves - now what kind of books would a vicious torturer check out of the public library. And I said - . . . . ? wha? I guess we take 'googling' for granted these days. Back in the day, everyone got their info by checking out public library books? What's more, Freeman is tied in to an underground source network that can get him FBI or CIA or whatever data. How does that matter? Well, you see, apparently the FBI or CIA or whatever was keeping track of who checks out which books from - the public library. So they ran a list of books and got back Stacey's name. They go to his apartment, he's coming down the long hallway with some groceries. They see him. He sees them. He pulls a gun and starts shooting. Suffice to say, he climbs the buildings and run the streets of the city better than Spiderman. And he corners Pitt on the ground, puts a gun to his head, but then runs.Next we know, Spacey comes into Pitt's police station, covered in blood, and surrenders himself. Pitt and Freeman say, they guy's going for seven murders. They had only five at that point. Spacey says, I'll show you guys. But it has to be youse guys. They say - show us.So they drive out into the desert by a cluster of electrical towers. And they stop for Spacey to lead them off into a field. There's a chopper shadowing them. But only Freeman notices a van barreling towards them. He jumps in his car, blocks the road, and orders the van driver out. Meanwhile, Pitt has Spacey kneel and Spacey takes the moment to reveal his dastardly plan. He's already visited Pitt's home. He's abused his wife, murdered her, and chopped off her head. And he says - that's her head coming now. Van driver says he got $500 to deliver a box. Freeman looks inside the box. Pitt on the radio asks the question. And by the time Freeman drives back to Pitt and Spacey, Pitt is just about to pull the trigger. So Freeman says - don't do it. But he does it and gets hauled away for murder. Spacey was counting on Pitt to shoot him as the seventh - whichever sin Spacey's character associated with himself. I didn't catch which he though was the wife's sin.Like I said, a Pacino type would have been much better in that role played by Pitt. It's difficult to get the 'message' of the movie. Usually, the cops are shown covering up for one another. So, here, the logical thing to have expected was that the chopper crew saw Spacey lunge for the weapon, with Freeman backing them up on that. Instead, they haul Pitt away. If the 'message' was don't let emotion overcome you, again, in most films the cops are shown covering. So - blam! - dead serial killer . . Pitt gets a trophy, roll credits. At least Freeman might have mentioned temporary insanity - the supposed defense in Gothika where such also wasn't mentioned.",Null,0,1,22 September 2009
Star Trek," Star Wars, if it were written by someone less talented than Lucas!
","Voted 1. Should be a 0 - Blair Witch as a cartoon awful. Bangs and thuds, red shirts tumbling to their doom, bangs and thuds, bad guys falling to their doom, black holes that are very selective in what they 'eat' . . and so on. It's a blend of anti-science and fantasy that separates this monstrosity from science fiction, and from Star Trek. That is, much looks similar to Star Trek. But then it becomes an overproduced ripoff of Star Trek themes and designs, similar to some low-budget TV series that never quite gets picked up.Abrams and the PR campaign had, it's true, told the fans of Trek to stay clear of his film. Wasn't for those who grew up on Trek, he said. This was for a new and credulous 'generation' who, I suppose, have never even heard reference made or seen so much as a parody of the series - which is most unlikely, if I might paraphrase our favorite Vulcan. The boomers who write TV shows have been referencing Star Trek for at least the last 20 years that I've watched commercial television.What the writers did, after speaking with Nimoy and getting back to him with a script, after his approval that is, was to take the characters of the bridge crew from the original series (TOS) and take them back to childhood, or at least their late teens (except for McCoy who was older). The actors dutifully looked the part, and adopted some of the mannerisms, and more often the clichés of the adult characters who created the franchise. But the adults were in their mid-30 to 40s. The kids are 10-15 years too young to be aboard THAT Enterprise. And it shows up particularly when baby-Kirk, this mock-Kirk from this mock-Trek film, early 20s, no command experience, just out of the academy is promoted to the captain's chair on the flagship of the fleet. All other officers were in the head, at the time, so one must assume.But then one must assume something similar of an entire race established in the series, the race of Romulans. They looked like Vulcans, except in this mock-Trek, where they look like the post-apocalyptic rabble of Mad Max, Waterworld or Aliens III. They had fleets of ships. But in this mock-Trek, they sit around on Romulus, refuse to colonize other planets or else call everyone back, ground every space ship, one must assume, and wait merrily for a supernova to destroy them - when by all science, a red giant should have done that, long, long before. Apparently, Ambassador Spock of Vulcan is coming to their rescue, in a sort of slow moving rotating shuttle of some kind. Save us, Spock! ? If the Romulans of the story were threatened by their sun dying, they'd not only have plenty of time to evacuate the system - they would have done that, and taken everything that, as it were, wasn't nailed down.Spock's cure was something called 'red matter'. Apparently, a single drop is all that was needed to somehow stop a supernova. But Spock brought half a quart. It's never explained why. So he falls out, not in, but out of a black hole (that's right), completely intact, and is captured by the villain. The villain takes a drop of Spock's red juice and destroys Vulcan. A couple of members of the high council, so-called, were trading recipes as the cavern they were in was about to fall apart on this utterly defenseless Vulcan (oh my, a giant laser beam from space, what-ever shall we do? Saave us, Spock!), as mock-Spock, the younger self, dashes in to say - HEY! you, navel-gazers, didn't you know the planet's breaking up, get the frick out of this cave - come ziss me if you vant to live? A couple of council members are predictably crushed by falling effects. Now a new 'homeworld' must be found. And the same question - what about the millions of Vulcans on other worlds, or were they also all ordered home at the same time? Didn't they have high councils, and independent governments, etc? The whole film is just a lazy, back-of-the-napkin Hollywood action film. You probably get your money's worth for all the nonsense on the screen, however bizarre and self-contradictory so much is if you stopped to think about it. But it moves along, and explodes, and goes BANG, and seems to be about something - like sports announcers always screaming the broadcast, no matter how boring the game.But since they changed so much about the backstory, while trying to retain young doppleganger versions of the bridge crew from the original, it's a film that doesn't draw you in. It spits at you. It shrieks at you. It says - fool, you paid to see this roller coaster ride. 'E' ticket. But you'll get bored. And this sure isn't Star Trek. The Enterprise doesn't have an engine room that looks like a brewery or sewage treatment plant - the warp engines run on steam power? The fleet isn't commanded by a bunch of 20-year amateurs who fly right into a closed-umbrella 'death star' space station disguised as a 'mining' vessel.A mock-Trek may be what some wanted to see. Malicious screen-writing. Malevolent production. Nimoy - WHAT were you thinkg? You are not Spock, your book title. Yeah, we get that. Doesn't mean you have to dump all over the franchise. So you're not Spock. Let it go! Or else, sick of Trekkers. Sick of constant Trek references in sitcoms and whatever else. No more Trek. This isn't your 'Daddies' Trek. This isn't any kind of Trek at all! Not in any way. It's bait n switch, it's theft of a franchise in order to stomp all over it. What's more, it's just bad film-making, which failure and contempt can't be rescued by a floor of competently produced stunts and effects.",Null,16,25,20 May 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Film that cannot easily be dismissed - that being said . .
","Kubrick is a tough one to appreciate. On the one hand you can't help but like his reliance upon the florescent light, lighting in general, and his slow set-work, set-piece films. And this is a film filled with fine leading and character actors, as well, quite obviously. And the latter alone often makes a film. So I want to dislike Kubrick. But I keep coming back to the DVDs, appreciating one or two things I had not previously. Kubrick, the late Kubrick, cannot be dismissed.On the other hand, having said that, Kubrickism is also infantilism, adolescent fixations upon sex. It's crude jokes. Kubrick is the father, and it's not too much of a stretch to say, of Beavis and Butthead, and South Park (the Comedy Central mushmouth voice animation with cutouts). It's said that 'theater people' never really mature. They don't grow up.Well, seen in that way, Strangelove is more a play-acted cartoon, like some FOX comedy of the 1990s. It's more farce than drama. 'Black comedy'? It doesn't come up to that. I don't think Kubrick intended such. And that was his mistake. It's because the farce is so cartoonish it overwhelms the drama. Drama there is. The set-piece interior of the B52 is striking, particularly for the era and the real cold war and desire to keep such military secrets. Pickens and the rest play it straight, mostly. So the Dallas/Vegas joke almost brings a laugh, in that context, but only because the tone is serious. Toe to toe with the Ruskies, like other absurd phrases, passed into the popular banter for decades afterward. There is suspense, action, and fear. These scenes make the film, and perhaps in spite of the farce and forced comedy ending.Because back at the base rooms, even what subtlety is absent. It's nothing but madness at the AF base with the 'funny' name, and the spinning tape drives. Peter Sellers has a string in his leg. A what? You mean to threaten a brother officer, he asks, obviously upset but too weak to attack and shake the 'code prefix' out of the insane Ripper. The South Park folk would have a name for Mandrake. So it turns out that Ripper concocted some leftwing conspiracy theory about fluoridation based on his own failed fornications, his impotence. And so the solution, ultimately, is to abandon monogamy in the mine shafts, with Sellers' Strangelove compulsively saluting Adolph Hitler, and all of it's Kubrickian.Stated another way, the clichés come fast and furious, just as in a recent film of that name. It's thoughtless. It's non sequitur. It's all too easy, and not generally funny. The work is put into the sets, not into the script. He's trying to make a point at odds with the very history of the time. The 'crisis' wasn't about reckless US action, but reckless Soviet action. And they literally had to loop or dub in Pickens as he originally jokes - Dallas - not Vegas. The President, in real life, had been assassinated. But even worse, the moral of the story is don't trust the Americans. They have no real control over their commanders or weapons. Not the 'Ruskies', as Pickens has it. Just as in the insane mocu-drama, Crimson Tide, America is reckless in its plans, in its commanders, and Russia, crazy as it may be (building a domesday device in this film), can always be trusted to keep the lid on. The good ole Ruskies. That's as much the vapid cliché as any. But Kubrick doesn't get it.Again, the sets were great. But the Kubrick insisted that Scott, later to only slightly ham it up as Patton, should be shown falling over himself, and otherwise behaving as a spoiled child, or slapstick comic - everything, one might say, but that pie fight. And Scott may not have appreciated it then, or later. And I don't, now, in the 21st century, looking at this film, yet again.For all that, one has to say that it is still a landmark film. It certainly doesn't merit a high rating on IMDb (and which is unusual given the age of the film). But it is good. It's good, again, not just for those sets, not just for the lead and supporting cast, but for the serious moments. It's good not for the concluding Nazi-farce scenes, which can lose the audience, but for the fight on the base. It's not good for the Hayden/Sellers play in the room, which is 'black comedy' much more with the low light on Hayden, than the close-ups of Sellers' Mandrake. It's good for the interplay of the crew on the B52.Kubrick, in short, was wrong. This didn't play better as a farce. It could have worked better as a comedy. It didn't need Nazi-farce in a wheelchair. It didn't need the infantilism and 'bodily fluid' conspiracies. It didn't need Scott/Turgidson as buffoon. It's played at worst as a live-action cartoon. And so it continues to appeal to the adolescent, and few more than that, and always will. Where it's played for suspense and drama, I think it still appeals to all. But to those more experienced, and more intelligent, the film surely seems flawed, important for its historical importance and historical place, but not so much as a film for the ages. It surely made its points, however taken by whatever activists then and later. But it just doesn't play honestly. It doesn't make sense. And as for laughs, most any similarly adolescent 'britcom' is going to be funnier.",Null,0,5,15 December 2005
Forrest Gump," Classic Film!
","Spoilers!First, it was a classic film, which should have won all the awards it did. Second - it could have been better.Gump is a tall tale, a cliched tour, of America from the 1950s through the 1980s. One man, a slightly retarded individual, named Forrest Gump, from the deep south of course, bumps into and/or is the cause of innumerable public events and incidents, decade after decade; each spiked with appropriate pop background music, from Hendrix to Fleetwood Mac. It's a bit strained to fit as many pop culture references into the life of one man, as with the back to back t-shirt episodes of the running man, Gump. But, generally, it works - except:Except that as with any tall tale, the how, why, and wherefore is always glossed over. How could he be so utterly unaware of himself and his place in publicized events, year after year? How could he run coast to coast and back again? and is that considered interesting (it's a slow point of the film). It's a joke, here, pathos there. It's a laugh at the Black Panthers - shown as ignorant, tedious and boring demagogues, who lecture a man who, under both enemy and friendly fire saved the life of his best friend, a black man - a laugh at the SDS - shown as basically a trendy, superficial and messed up Bohemian - the March on Washington crowd - 'offing the pigs' while hastily presenting a man who utterly opposes their agenda - the Mr. Goodbar disco set - bunch of licentious druggies, and no more - and so on and so forth. For those whom the anti-war crowd and Mr. Goodbar were heroes, this film must be like a knife in the side. But it's not really anti-liberal, or conservative, so much as it remains a tall tale and a platform for almost sketch comedy, but based on what the writers knew or esteemed, which would seem to be liberal causes mostly - so those are what wind up getting skewered.The pathos is suggested in Gump as the 'little child' of Scripture - to be as the child, to accept others, to be uncritical, to always believe, and the like. He never holds a grudge. He always want to believe the best of others. He transforms Dan's life, and presents the most emotional moment of the whole film when Dan comes to visit for the wedding, between Gump and his doomed wife, Jenny - and is able to walk on artificial limbs, obviously happy to be alive.However, Gump isn't really a child. A while his acceptance of others is laudable, the reason is still that of incompetence. He literally doesn't know enough not to be naive. He doesn't have a choice - and it's not a choice he makes, therefore. Add to the fact that his entire life is really a series of screenwriter's jokes. He simply cannot appreciate what he's done, or why. It's all a blur of events which he relates in the most alienated, and disconnected fashion. It's only to contradict the story so far when running man, Gump, remarks on the beauty of a mountain reflecting on a lake below, or the momentary pause from the rain in Vietnam. It's like two different people, but the simple, and gentle man, not really involved in his own life, is the one seen through most of the film. Real people who have mental disabilities, supposedly as Gump, could appreciate the sunset over a lake, and could express a far wider range of emotion than the emotionally stunted Gump. Had they made the simple man more aware of himself, more human, it would have been a much better film upon repeated viewing.Ultimately, it could be the writers present a message they didn't intend to. Gump is great not just because good things happen to him, even in desperate situations, but because he has not convinced himself, as the boomers around him have in this film, that life is not only not like a box of chocolates, because there must be some planning and goal setting in life, but that life is just one long stumble after another through cheap slogans and debilitating drugs. One stumbles through nature, friends, wealth, awards, and accomplishment. Thinking itself so much smarter, the other just stumbles, and is not even to be pitied for it. It's a message film, to be sure. But the message can get lost in the humorous tall tale, because in that sense, it's almost two films, instead of one.",Null,0,2,7 January 2000
Pitch Black," Suicidal heroine spoils the drama
","Odd sci-fi film about a group of 40, like some group of people on a passenger airline, in suspended animation (like that will ever work) on a log like that in 2001 heading . . somewhere - I guess. They float over what looks like a black hole, but which I guess is intended to show a planet with rings and a large moon or planet (?).The spaceship flames into the planet/moon's atmosphere. Flames everywhere tearing the ship apart. The Captain jettisons entire compartments from the log and threatens to eject the passengers, as well - to save weight, 'tail-heavy', sumpin like that.Eventually, the glass breaks and the flames hit her right in the face. Oh, yeah, spaceship lands. And she's fine - not even a blemish on her face. Miracle of miracles, or continuity of continuity error.They find large dinosaur-like skeletons all over. And they find a base where some small crew had set up a small drilling rig. It's a breathable atmosphere, if a bit thin - which plot point is quickly discarded. Three moons, but not all at the same time.And one of the passengers is Diesel. At first he seems a maniacal killer guarded by some marshall-type. Turns out he's a lunatic guarded by another lunatic playing at being marshall for the bounty on Diesel. Vin can also see in the dark. So is he the monster, the antagonist? Nope. The seeing in the dark comes into play when they discover that little corner of the planet is infested with man-sized flying killer bats, or whatever. They look more like the 'warrior bugs' from Starship Troopers, or least have that head but more a pterodactil's body. But they are stricken with any light source. So they 'only come out at night'.The ringed planet causes an eclipse which just goes on and on, and all the flying critters take to the skies, thousands and thousands of them. The group find a small shuttle in need of some 'power packs'. Said packs are on their crashed ship. Shuttle is some distance away. It's dark. Critters flying - what to do? So they find whatever point light or glowing light they can find and set out. Diesel drags the power packs. The others stumble and bumble and cry and argue every step of the way. And of course they periodically fall down. Worse - it starts to rain (kid you not).In fact, the whining and stumbling and delaying is so annoying that you start to root for the 'warrior bugs' to finish them off and for Diesel to get away. But there's something even worse than that. And that is, the Captain is always carrying on. And with the pitch black of the eclipse, she's always for going ahead here or going back there, and taking five minutes to make her point out where the 'bugs' can swoop down on her. And you keep saying to yourself - puh-lease . . swoop down . . end it already. She's suicidal, though the writers probably didn't intend it that way. And the happy ending is that as our annoying 'heroine' begins yet another five minute soliloquy about heroism and let's move forward and let's go back and I'm not afraid you're not afraid, choke, gasp, etc. one of the 'bugs' swoops in and stabs her, hangs around for half a minute so Diesel can look longingly into her eyes, and off it goes with her body. Yay! Thank you! Finally! Case ended. Diesel installs the packs. And he and the two remaining survivors take off and head for well-traveled space trading routes for a rescue.Moral of the story. You can be weak and slow and stumble on obstacle courses with thousands of flying killer 'bugs' that can see you but you can't see them. That's okay. But to start a darned fireside chat every time you think of heading out to save the company, or going back to save them, that's what you do when you WANT the monsters to get you.",Null,0,4,3 October 2009
The Fast and the Furious," The Clanton gang as long haul truck thieves and . . ?
","SPOILERS!Bad acting. Bad script. 'Hot babes'. Etc. Etc. That could be a typical review. But there's more to it, in my opinion.On one level, a movie about drag racing . . 'rice rockets'? The NHRA has a new 'sports compact' division. And Harley Communications felt, in Sep 2002, that 'sports compact' racing was the 'future of our sport'. That's a bit disheartening. 9-11 second lil mini-mouse motors with turbochargers instead of big blocker supercharged race engines. Some future. The trick isn't knowing when to shift, but when to push the button?On the other level, it's a film about gangsters, of various sorts, and particularly the main 'crew' of commercial track hijackers. It's the latter that tends to dominate the film. And I think the film is making its points not about the 'street racing', as such, but about its suggestions and 'lessons' when it comes to armed robbery. The twist on the film is that you don't really learn the identity of the 'crew' until the end, though it's suggested all along. Meanwhile, it's a cop backstory, which in the voice over the director, Cohen, said he personally found boring, compared to other scenes. He said Ted Devine (Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs, and Luca's 'muscle' in the old Crime Story tv series) did 'his best', or something, with the scenes. It's can't be good when the director is describing the movie in this way on the DVD commentary.As for the film, some things do ring true. Diesel, as best customer, phones up the 'speed shop', or whatever they now call themselves, and demands the undercover cop be fired. And the store owner reluctantly refuses. A power play. But it rings true to life. Same for the refitters, and job shops, that profit off these 'rice rocketeers', who don't ask where the money comes from. Just - sir (as from, sire) - sire, how may I serve the king? Just put the money on the table - integrity, we don't need no stinkin integrity (to borrow a line from the famous movie). From real estate to whatever, to government bribes, that does ring true. All money is 'clean', or dirty and no one cares.The Vince character is the 'roid rage' guy, of the 'crew'. Give him a dirty look, and he'll play Billy the Kid and push you in the back. If he had a gun he'd come up and shoot you in the back of the head. He's the lovable psychopath that the undercover cop risks his life to rescue at the end, as Vince attempts to rob a truck at high speed, saving him from a terrified trucker with a shotgun, who becomes the 'bad guy'. The Vince character is real - little men with 10 ton chips on their shoulders, and desire to hurt people.Another member of the 'crew' is the stereotype of the all-around 'genius' who flakes at the last when he loses a race, and makes off with the car he forfeited. I think they make him out to be MIT. Why they never pick Cal Tech for these films, I don't know, particularly since the story is in LA. And this is the point when the undercover guy starts to lose cover, and events are forced in other ways, as well. The 'genius' returns before the final chase to say - gee, I'm sorry. And, okay guys, it's time now the final race scene, off ya go!Vin Diesel is decribed in the commentary as a 'rising star', or something of the sort. Good for him. He portrays an ex-con who runs the little band of crooks. His cars wins. He doesn't flinch when the undercover guy is caught by Vince, and Vince wants to blow him away with a shotgun. He's supposed to be 'honest', 'self-possessed', 'responsible', in some fashion, when he should be back in jail.So when it comes to 'mini' racing, when it comes to gangs, this film is a clean, black and white, no consequences adolescent fantasy. This is World Wide Wrestling brought to a director's vision of import car 'turbo-racing', I guess you'd more properly call it. And will Vince makes it through you wonder? Poor ole misunderstood Vince. He just came from the wrong side of the tracks. Have pity on him. It's not his fault. He didn't choose this life. But, at the same time, be sure to throw the book at that shotgun wielding trucker. If only he'd known what a decent guy that Vince really was, deep down. I tell you - even though the director didn't want you to, I was rooting for the trucker.I suppose one wonders about the popularity of Billy the Kid and John Hardin and others as popularized in serials of the day. How could people be caught up in such behavior. Maybe because it was far away, on the frontier? Maybe because it was always the guy sitting at the table, next to you, who got his head blown off for giving 'the kid' a dirty look? I don't know. But that's what this film calls to mind, for me. It's a simplistic, exaggerated glamorization of gangsterism, calling to mind the east coast 'penny dreadfuls' of generations past, and where the gang bangers are all nice, kind, good to their mothers, and always ready to be a friend to the poor and despised. In one form or another, this sort of fiction has sold well for over 100 years. And I think it's silly.",Null,0,1,15 February 2004
Pearl Harbor," Great film - only if it 'calls to mind'
","Spoilers!It's a great film. But . . . . it IS cliched. Basically, what you have is a 21st century war propaganda film . . . about WWII. Remember now - after the movie - BUY WAR BONDS!Or, in other words, if the film works, at points, I think it's really for no other reason than that it was released on Memorial Day. I found it very moving when, toward the end, the dead still entombed in the Arizona Memorial, were mentioned by the narrator. If you identify with the love interest, and clearly the critics are loathe to do so, but where the sets and costumes and 'Francis-style' lighting encourage one to think 1940s . . 1940s, then she becomes a symbol; as you'd expect from a propaganda film. She's not just the 'dame' in the love triangle. Rather, she's the women who lost men in wartime, who served in the nursing core, both at Pearl and so many other places, and so forth. Frankly, I think Private Buckaroo, or Action in the North Atlantic, and Walking in the Sun, and so on, were better propaganda efforts, actually produced during the war. But . . . this is 2001, after all. In Titanic, the tacked on love story represented nothing but the characters, themselves, and badly at that. If Evelyn and the others are seen to represent so many others from that era, then Titanic, it's not.As for the characters, then, it's difficult to see Danny as a pilot. He doesn't look it any more than Cruise did in the much earlier Bruckheimer-fest of Top Gun (where the tacked on love story, there, was disastrous, and for the career of McGillis, as well - Kelly who?). Now Anthony Edwards, I believed. And one can imagine Rafe, both in England and elsewhere. Old photos from Britain, during the Battle of Britain, show 'fly-boys' who literally look like Hollywood's central-casting image of a fighter pilot - but for real. So Affleck is believable because . . he's that. He's the guy on the poster, telling you about those war bonds. Beckinsale's Evelyn is also nearly believable. But I think I believe the romance and proposal from the stuttering 'Red', much more easily.Ironically, I found the Doolittle Raid more involving than the sneak attack on Pearl. It's interesting that critics trying to demonstrate some command of history, here and elsewhere, forget conveniently that the attack was a secret, sneak attack. There was no 'warrior code' to be found, anywhere. It was purely a cowardly bombing run on a military base, one asleep and unaware than some particular country was literally now in a shooting war with the US. It was like the 'japs' shooting an unarmed country in the back, as it were. And it surely infuriated the American people - precisely - for that reason. That wasn't propaganda and lies. That was the reality. One could argue Roosevelt 'set it up', and so on, and so forth. But nobody made or forced the Imperial Japanese fleet to bomb the American Pacific Fleet when war had not even been declared. All for the Empire, when it was the very idea of that Japanese Empire which had to be defeated - as it was for Italy and Germany, and their '1000-year empires'. It's why the exploits of the sub crew in Das Boot, an extraordinary film, are such a tragedy - for their individual heroism, their 'imperial' cause rightly reduces them to playing the heavy.The Doolittle Raid seemed the better of the two key sequences only because more of the details seemed to be revealed. The plane crash in China may have been the most striking sequence. And historically the raid was a huge propaganda victory for the Allies who felt themselves clawing at the cliff of survival in the face of the Axis; and just as mentioned by the film's narrator, here. The raid on Pearl seemed a little light on such details. The smoke, for example, is almost absent when compared with photos and footage of just after the 2nd wave. In reality it looked like a massive tire fire, a firestorm. In the film, it looked like isolated smudge pots. The oil soaked sailors seemed believable. But the immediate rescue efforts seemed a little weak. They had more equipment than that ready to go. But film budgets are film budgets, even if they're huge. And where was the scout plane which led the attack? I thought surely that was the purpose of the opening scene in the duster - because of the visual similarity to the Japanese scout.Overall, sure . . . Rafe and Danny sink the carriers at Midway - well, if the film continued that long, sure it would have been Rafe. And he'd probably have been piloting the Enola Gay, as well, after having just single-handedly shot down a German mini-jet. Film makers can be excused for 'composite experiencing'. And such cliche as in this film is also - about - other films. It's not honest by itself. It calls . . to mind, other things. But if the critics wanted a good story, as they say, then they wouldn't make such a play about Shawshank - a hopelessly overrated effort - or American Beauty or other such wastes. That they pan this effort says nothing about filmmaking, and everything about agendas. I and others can have our agendas. And I most surely do. All those on imdb.com can have their agendas. And clearly many do. But critics tell us it's about the movies, for them - and they seem even less about the movies than the PR flacks which ginned up the Shawshank count here on this website. It's not so much that this film is 'critic proof'. I doubt few liked Raiders of the Lost Ark when first released. I think the LA guy panned it, only to have to quickly 'amend' his review a month or so, later (Champlin was his name?). It's really - why . .. . critics? I understand the concept. It's the execution that puzzles me. What the heck is a critic if he's just a Clinton-shilling Ebert, or some other slow-witted, mindless zealot who could care less about the steak, and prefers to tell the sizzle how it sounds? You know - guy - what about . . . the actual movie? That's what we're paying to see.",Null,0,0,27 May 2001
Flashdance," Influential classic, not just for its day, but still flawed.
","Spoilers! Very influential film, at the time, about a PA girl from Altoona who grows up to be a stripper/ballet dancer, with a personality so split it looks like a different woman doing the dancing - but, of course . . .The stand in for Beals, Marine Jahan, is not listed in the credits. She's listed here on IMDb, but only if you know enough to scroll down to the bottom of the 'other crew' list. No mention is made of her in any other on-line store for the vid or CD! From that, it's as if she never existed. In addition, supposedly another woman performed as the bike rider, and a man performed the flips (according to a couple of Usenet messages I found). From that standpoint, clearly Cynthia Rhodes, who later starred with Travolta in a less successful dance film, and then later with Swayze in Dirty Dancing, steals the show as 'Tina Tech'. But part of the criticism of the film might be that the dance numbers seem almost sparingly employed, that more of Rhodes could have been written in, and that the courtship of Nouri and Beals almost drags at some points.On the other hand, to call the women strippers, while true, misses the point of the sort of acts found at Mawby's, as opposed to the evil Zanzibar. These are virtuoso dance interpretations cut into the degrading ethos of a strip club. This is Jezebel in a hundred variations, doing her belly dance in the tent, with uncluttered pre-drum n bass dance music and one note 'crying' guitars as 'mood enhancers'. It's the music video, as from Easy Rider, and many films before, in parts. And here it's just in parts, too. The cleverer it gets, the more pretentious it seems, as with 'Beals' final number against the white tile wall. Even Rhodes' performance seems a little silly. And the water splash on Beals has been parodied so often that to review the film, today, one is tempted to call it silly, as well. At the time, it wasn't a cliché. And what Rhodes did seemed something new, as well. Beals, in a recent interview, very widely copied to various sites on the net, remarks that she saw the influence of this little film in young women all over the world, at the time, not only in some newfound desire to become a dancer, but that trendy meant torn 'Alex' garb and the suggestion of good life for a young girl in a dust choked, ear-shattering mill or machine shop.The film makers attempted to be true to steel town, no doubt. And there are many shots of the dank atmosphere, but also the almost cozy mill, welding there, and machine shops covered over in dust and grit and mostly unused, as the light streams in again in an almost comforting, artistic fashion. It's cold, more than dusty. But it's difficult to convey that on screen - without icicles or snow banks, perhaps. So it's really, kind of warm. And it's still, when walking through the rooms of grinders, when frolicking in the abandoned mill. And the 'dancer's loft doesn't seem so disgusting as Nouri's character seems to suggest when first invited in. The mood set is one of quiet and gentle isolation, perhaps in some sense to suggest that of the dancer alone before an audience. Or that might be unintentional. And so Beals comments on the effects of the film, are understandable. The young women saw what was on screen, whatever the film makers otherwise intended.The plot isn't so much filler as a number of key scenes in the 'dancer's life, from the Zanzibar owner's assault in the parking lot, to Jeanie's falls on the ice and subsequent fall to the Zanzibar, literally on her back, to the radiator breaking as 'Izod'/Ritchie bids his goodbye, for the moment, and so on. The scenes are carefully designed and lit. There's a music to much of this non-dance filler that seems to hold up perhaps better than some of the so often parodied dance numbers, from now over 20 years ago. (In real life, the actress portraying Jeanie unfortunately died shortly afterward, I believe from a rupture strangely similar to that which in real life also killed the woman singing that very song as Jeanie ice dances).All the actors command the screen very well, if not necessarily with much depth. It is difficult to believe that Beals is a welder, for ex. Yes, it's possible - maybe. To the witness on the stand - but you DO allow for the remote possibility, do you not Mr . . And as a remote possibility, sure. The film almost works because of that 'fantasy' aspect, where the women who hang with Alex are all strikingly beautiful. That's already a step away from any reality. Then there's the question of how did the former ballerina and Ziegfield dancer, Alex's/Beal's teacher, train the stripper to be a ballerina? Her audition before the panel is the sort of heavy, bouncy thing the strippers at Mawby's would be famous for, not what someone applying for the city ballet would perform. And of course, as mentioned first here, it is just annoying and distracting to see the noticeably different appearance of the stand-in, Jahan, from Beals. This surely was a complaint of the film, even at the time. And it's still something that takes one out of the story, and back to the reality of just watching some movie. Beals may have fit the role of doe-eyed manipulator for this film. But to see her, and then another 'Darren', back and forth from scene to scene, is what perhaps hurts even more than the rest.",Null,0,1,31 October 2006
Resident Evil," Super-killer zombie virus destroys the world?
","Apocalyptic. But it's supposed to be more than just one virus - in terms of the real apocalypse, whenever it might be.Some here complain about a computer game. I could care less about a computer game. Movies based on comics. I could care less about comic books, and so on.Here, the movie ends with our 'vampire-slaying' heroine basically emerging into the surface, shotgun in hand, to find zombie destruction and zombies probably about to come out of every open door. Roll credits. Apparently, she got the cure. But the doctors themselves were attacked by remaining zombies, or whatever, or just took to the disease because it was in the air - something. It's not explained. She appears to get the cure. And everyone else seems to disappear before she escapes from the locked OR.As for how she got there, well apparently there's this big e-ville private corporation, probably tied into the military I'm so sure, that build an overly large Andromeda Strain underground round lab in order to create mutate devil dogs and whatever other sort of monsters - including zombies. Yeah. And so, they succeeded. And 'vampire-slayer' and her SWAT team friends - yes, I kid you not - are ordered by the e-ville company to shut down the problem, blow the lab, etc, etc.But by the time they get there, the e-ville central computer, the artificially intelligent Eagle Eye/HAL/every other such computer you've seen in movies, has locked down the facility and sees her and the SWATs as part of the problem, not part of the solution.And the e-ville computer has a terrifying, and kind of silly, weapon to take care of the troops. They walk down a corridor. Lights suddenly come on. Gertrude, or whatever the computer is named, locks doors at both ends and proceeds to scan the hallway with something like an industrial laser beam, cutting off body parts and cauterizing simultaneously. The last guy is about to avoid the beam when he's presented with a hole he can't jump through. Basically the killer laser takes the shape of chicken wire fence, passes through him, and carves him into wee, little diamond-shaped pieces.So the remaining team shut down the computer, find the zombies, figure they have to turn back on the computer, find more zombies, find a cure, more zombies, and the two remaining survivors stumble topside only to be manhandled and separated by guys in germ protective gear. As I said, the 'CDC' guys mysteriously disappear, the heroine escapes, and finds that zombies now rule - at least in the town around the facility.Are there plot holes? Well . . golly. Is the mission even sensible given the actions of the computer to essentially do their job? The only guy with any real purpose in being there is the cad, the scoundrel, who wants to 'sell-it-to-the-Ruskies', or just to whomever. And of course, she's there to eventually take the cure. But that's not really her stated mission.So good film? Not quite even good. But a few moments. Monsters in the dark.",Null,0,0,29 September 2009
Independence Day," Good overproduced cliched-ridden film
","SPOILERS.S.E.T.I gets word. Why? Who knows. The Pentagon has its own surveillance and that's the next scene. Bigger than a bread basket. Is it a meteor? Well, good golly Bob (Robert Loggia), it a quarter the size of the moon they just told you, and it looks like a giant razor stand on the infrared. And that sort of sets the tone.It's a comedy, of committee planning, in the film, and of the film. But the overproduced special effects, which still look good, the camera work, and so on, make it a fun film to watch. Just turn off the sound and captions. Amazingly, you'll be able to follow the 'plot' step for step.As for those who have the I-hate-America-first attitude, when I see similar complaints about James Bond or Jackie Chan or whoever else 'saving-the-world-again', then maybe such consistency would barely help their laments. It's a film about impossibly odd American resourcefulness, coupled with the bravery of fighter pilots in Russia, Israeli and Arab working together, Japanese and so on. But only Goldblum stumbled on the key.And it's a ridiculous solution. First he discovers the countdown. But by the time the count is down, it's pretty obvious the aliens mean to do damage. So it becomes a device merely to get him on Air Force One. Then Dad breaks down with his Area 51 rant, only to have it confirmed by the bad guy insider and all around 'weasel'. So off to the only working command and control center in the whole wide world, taking AF1 and its capabilities as well, that the aliens can't track, even with the traffic, of all sorts, going in and out, and Goldblum has another epiphany. You can't shoot through the force fields of the aliens. So get them to drop shields by - what - flying up there with a 40 year old spaceship and uploading a computer virus to their operating system. Are they using Windows XXX? I mean. Is this rewriting the HD boot sector? What? It's actually the major plot point. And it makes no sense. Did Bill Gates really cut a deal with space aliens before anyone ever knew they existed - well . . that might seem superficially plausible. And I guess that version of Windows doesn't check for outdated software in order to automatically upgrade. A 40 year old space ship? It would be like trying to fool Saddam by sneaking in and trying to land with an F4 Phantom, or something. People would notice.So, anyway. Forget everything you knew in the previous scene, basically. That's how it works. It's not just a bunch of comfortably cliched characters and plot 'twists' drawn almost from other films, as some have suggested here, but almost isolated cliched scenes without too much regard to what came before or after in the film, overall. So the monster goes beserk. Great. Fine. If this was a government lab in the arctic. But we just saw this is Area 51 and the last US military installation in operation. There's lot of guards, and they would be inside the operatory, watching through the window, and so on, especially if they thought the space man was alive. But then the Pres wouldn't get his telepathic vid-flick, though to what purpose I can't imagine. They already established that the space aliens intended to wipe out all of humanity in three days or less. What, that wasn't enough motivation? Oh, yeah, now we find out they're like a bunch of locusts. Well, now that we know that. I suppose the point there is that it's the belated answer to 'Mommy, why is this happening?' And stripper Mom could reply, 'well, there's this Hollywood system, you see . . ' But I guess that wouldn't be a very satisfactory reply.In short, it's a watchable film, without the dialog and if you don't try to read lips. Watch for Harry Connick Jr. to embarrass himself in most scenes. You can turn on the sound for that. Will Smith doesn't do badly, but is saddled with more than a few cliches of his own. Goldblum is annoying and obviously uncomfortable, as some have noted. He's most insecure in the spaceship. So that's another bit of dialog to take in. And what's up with the flight suits? That's not a Tomcat. It's a spaceship with a force field around it. But, enough of that. It's a good movie. It's funny. Good fx. Don't expect The Godfather. But it's better than Godzilla.",Null,1,2,18 November 2002
Twilight," Book pages omitted - but, gosh - this is a MOVIE!
","Lots of reviews here and elsewhere lament the missing pages, or changed plot. Well, if this were Lord of the Rings, they might have a point. But Signs, or Twilight? Maybe even the Time-Travelers Wife (or life? or whatever). There are some well-reviewed novels that make it to film. But . . Twilight? So for films like this I say - the book, who cares about the book? The missing pages . . nobody ever read them to begin with. The changed plot . . what plot, except that one sees on screen. I think that's being more than fair. THERE IS NO BOOK! never was - least not for this kind of book.Then to take the film for what it is, for what's on screen, I DO agree with many reviews posting here. These aren't vampires. They are something with super-hero strength and the ability to leap (which I thought was the werewolf thing, or the wire-fu thing), who don't age (like Dorian Gray), but who aren't affected by sunlight and who don't really get evil vampire Nosferatu faces or really big teeth. But they do suck necks.The plot is about a young-leading-effeminate man o the 21st century, I suppose, who is a super-hero vampire and has some school chums and others who are, as well. He saves the life of a girl at school - with his super-hero skills. She's surprised, wants to know more, and . . well, she's just so purty that the fact she's a bimbo and airhead, otherwise, is of apparently no concern.So they all go play baseball in the middle of nowhere, at dusk. And out of the trees off in the distance comes this trio of growed-up vampires. One is a real freak who sniffs out the airhead and says - hey, that's a snack. Me wants! But the 21st-century man says, she's mine, and this is ours, and you gots to go. So the freak chases him and airhead as they try to escape in their pickup or SUV, I forget.That is, 21st and airhead decide to make a run. But first thing freak does is go to Mom's house. He picks up on airhead's cell after she had been talking to Mom. We naturally assume Mom is dead. Next up would be Dad. But apparently freak vampire never makes it that far. He tells airhead, get away from doze guys and meet me in an abandoned school you attended as a kid. Mom lives if you do. She says basically, oh thank you Mr. Psycho vampire killer for being so honest and oh, heck yeahs, I'll meet you in an abandoned building at night just as quick as I can, just you betcha.So she gets beat up, and as freak is about to do her in then 21st century come crashing in and picks a fight. Some of the others of his gang show up. Airhead is all bloodied and near death - or 'the turn' - so much so that one of the girl 'vampires' can barely contain her 'hunger'. Needlesstosay, they take out freak, burn up his corpse in a corner, and airhead is next seen in the hospital.They conclude this - movie - by 21st and airhead going to the prom. And the final scene has an ally of freak in an upstairs window looking down on the happy couple - just you wait (for the sequel?).This film was apparently a big hit with the 'tweens'. A sad commentary on adolescent tastes heading toward 2010. It's not even so much the idea of 'good vampirism', which is frightening enough. Even Mr. 21st-century has to refer to himself as a 'monster' at the very end, just to remind the audience what part he's supposed to be playing. What's worse is just the stupidity of the heroine. She IS the girl who falls on the path as the villain is giving chase. She IS the one to walk alone upstairs and slowly turns the knob on the closed door. She's the one making the long-winded speech out in the open with the killer monsters closing in. And so on. And in those films, you tend to root against that stupidity. And that's the catch. It brings that out, intentionally, in the audience - rooting for a character to be brutally murdered. And it's not a good thing.",Null,0,2,11 October 2009
Blue Crush," A bit of a generic sports flick, but interesting actresses and locales
","The rather cute story of some surfer chick/bums, perpetually broke, living the dream in Hawaii. One of them is a former competitor and champion. But she hit bottom, literally, and can't get on the bike again. So that's the plot. Get her back in competitive women's surfing.She and her two friends work as maids in one of the hotels. She has a younger sister who goes to a local school, and generally acts up. But she's a cutie, too. They all are, basically. So it's around February, and the NFL Pro Bowlers come to town. There's the QB and his lineman, presumably from his own team. The QB sort of looks the part, because QBs generally are not that built. They're not all Terry Bradshaw. And the offensive lineman sometimes can have a belly and still be all-Pro - think Larry Allen. So I found the casting just barely believable in that. And she and the QB sort of hit it off. And eventually she offers, with the help of her friends, to teach them how to surf.It's a comic scene after scene as they learn to surf. But the point is to make the payoff. She goes to his hotel room, and he practically propositions her with a wad of bills. But she takes it home, pays the rent, etc, and we're on to the competition. Of course, she starts having sex with the QB, too. But it's for love, not the money. Certainly not any suggestion of actual marriage.The heart of the story is the competition. She has to get over her fear. She has to brave a number of waves. And of course - she wins in the end, gets the sponsorship deals, etc. That is success.The film really, that is, didn't have much of a story to tell. The story really was surfing itself, a sort of lifestyle, and that people would devote time to this, and to the competitions. The Pro Bowl backstory, while providing the 'love interest' only served to show their interest in this thing called - surfing.Despite surfers complaining that it wasn't just one big wave ride after another in this film, the film, nonetheless, is all about surfing - because it really is not about anything else. It's light-hearted. The actresses are almost always smiling, which is attractive. It's just a film with a lot of cute scenes, and at least one 'gross-out' scene. And when they do hit the water, there are some clever following shots right into the water showing the 'washing machine' that grabs the surfers who fall.I suppose the actresses have other commitments. I suppose Rodriquez will be about done with, Lost (which looks on the verge of getting cancelled). And I'm sure many would wonder, even though 'Penny' is now much older and very different, if the three other actresses are looking to reprise a Blue Crush II?",Null,0,0,31 January 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Clumsy direction, but worth the ticket
","A popular film. Over 800 imdb.com comments within the first ten days. Sellout crowds at the theaters. However, as with the first part of the trilogy, Jackson is clumsy in his direction. The movie drags at times, and comes together in strange, disconnected ways - so unlike Tolkien's novel. It's been said that the film is boring. It's been said this is because Tolkien was boring. No one who has ever tried to read just one page of Lord of The Rings could believe that. Tolkien's casual style insists on telling a story, drawing one instantly into that world, and not calling attention to the novelist writing his novel (or the filmmaker calling attention to the beauty that is New Zealand, rather than the story of Middle Earth). Tolkien isn't to blame. Jackson is. This movie required a great director, with craft and a vision to work with. Had Jackson really paid his dues to direct Lord of the Rings?Editing could help Twin Towers and a few flybys could be scrapped entirely. The film would move faster and flow better. The much maligned Bakshi cartoon of the 1970s, while weak on effects and hired extras, certainly makes the Jackson films seem plodding and leaden, by comparison. Bakshi was on pace to tell the entire Lord of The Rings in under four hours, not nine, had his money held out. The ideal Lord of The Rings movie, in other words, would take the pacing of Bakshi's telling, or more to the point, Tolkien's, the effects of the 21st century and Jackson, etc., and stick more faithfully to the plotlines and story Tolkien developed, as well. Those were well thought out.The flybys suggest something else, as well. A disconnect. The audience isn't shoulder to shoulder with the characters, as in Bakshi's version. We are not running along, or fighting the fights. The audience is watching. The shots are wide shots. It's not an adventure - but an arena. There aren't story arcs, and subplots. There aren't characters, consistent in some ways, and changing in others. There are simply contests, and comic relief between the next show or bout. It's not that much of an exaggeration to compare Jackson's version of Tolkien's classic to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Entertainment.Given the rewrite, then, of Tolkien's novel, by Jackson, and the emphasis in a George Lucas world much more on special effects than anything else, how did Jackson do? In my opinion, the Gollum was well done, but somehow cold, and mechanical. I know this has gotten rave reviews. But something was missing that you had in the snippets of Bakshi, by comparison. His Gollum, as a film version, even if a rotoscope, was more engaging. Jackson's approach of Saruman's army was impressive, as was the Battle at Helm's Deep (something Bakshi couldn't hope to rival with what he had). I did miss those magical mortars of Saruman, though. I thought that was what breached the wall in the book. The conclusion of Eomer's ride with Gandolph the White was cut short, I think, considering how much time was spent on the points of the battle beforehand. All of a sudden, it just ended, and Saruman had been defeated. But the charge down the hill was very impressive, as well, even if a whole bunch of the original '10,000' had disappeared (shades of Bakshi).One could argue about Fanghorn, as well. I believe it was called bright, and interesting, in the book. In Jackson's view, it was forever forboding and decrepit. One of the ents seemed geared for the funny papers. But generally I thought the Ents were well done. On the other hand, the inclusion of the elves at Helm's Deep seemed gratuitous. They didn't change the outcome. The Rohanim still rode to the rescue. There were just a bunch of dead of elves to show in the gloom. I didn't understand the point of any of that. And Tolkien wouldn't have, either. Show the 'fires of Isengard', instead. Spend the scripting, and the money, on that. Jackson is not Tolkien. Jackson didn't write Lord of the Rings. Maybe as something of a hack, by comparison, the man is jealous of Tolkien. But that doesn't change anything.
Again, the question is whether Jackson is fit or qualified to direct an epic like Lord of the Rings. I think Bakshi did far better, with a paltry few resources by comparison. Speilberg, perhaps. Others. You don't know. But sticking to the book is probably something new for Hollywood. This is a case where they should have done so, and tried to understand Tolkien rather than impart their own dim sense of things onto a work adapted, at best.Still, for being boring, and a misstep, and an exercise in the pride of someone who thought he was Tolkien, but wasn't, there's still a lot to appreciate in the film. It is certainly worth a matinee price, even at six dollars, or so. It's worth that. On the other hand, the huge Christmas/New Year's sellout crowds, which doubled the gross compared to FotR, might only encourage more of this sort of treatment of the classics, rather than something with today's f/x, but perhaps yesterday's more profoundly human and interesting filmmaking. If only someone could be found to put those two together, and then attempt something like - The Lord of the Rings.",Null,0,0,29 December 2002

Kelly's Heroes," One of my favorites
","Spoilers!Very good film. Still one of my favorites. But it is a cobbled together Hollywood vice-president sort of effort, or seems like it. The cast, some well placed sets and production, and music save it.Nazi Operation Tannenbaum. An American unit, fresh off the invasion on D-Day, now moving deeper into France, grabs an intelligence colonel, somehow captured by Eastwood (Kelly) and friend, right in the middle of a Nazi staging area in a rain storm. They make a break for it, run back to their lines, and Kelly discovers a gold bar in the colonel's attache case. He gets a few details - where the gold is - that it's defended by some Panzer tanks. Off Kelly goes. He convinces the unit to join him in the heist. And ultimately - they gets the gold, and presumely go AWOL to Switzerland. Their commanding officer likely reports them all dead, cause he's a goofball and how else could he explain it, and so on.That's right. It's a comedy. It literally is a comedy. There are some convincing scenes - realistic big budget scenes - the opening scene, the sort of 60's western gun-em-down with Sutherland and crew taking a railway station to the strains of country music blaring on the Sherman's loudspeakers, and 'Crapgame's little office among the overabundance of crates and more crates at a depot, the army moving up, or moving back, with the planes flying over, as the unit lays to on the side of the road, and many other scenes, as well - like the commando unit/fortune hunters merrily cruising through the byways of assorted French towns on the way to the bank. Perhaps it was slated to be a big budget war film, and got sidetracked along the way - like the plot of the film, itself.It seemed like a little of this - a little of that. Plot points are thrown out, forgotten, contradicted. And who cares? It's sort of directed for laughs - like the example of the operatic spaghetti western (which had made Eastwood a major star) guitar music (virtually from Hang 'em High) as the main star trio approaches the tank in the square next to the bank. Maybe it's because the offbeat, but catchy music, keeps things honest. Maybe it's because the country tunes sound even better in 2002 than they did in the late 60s. Maybe it's because the actors play it sufficiently serious when required. Maybe it's just following 'Oddball's very competent tank crews and wondering how they'd do under another set of circumstances.
One of the plot points that seems unanswered, beyond whether Maitland really DID report them all killed in action, is how they advanced unimpeded after the battle at the minefield. They killed I don't know how many Nazis of what looked like a small camp/fuel dump. That would have been noticed, and pretty quickly; as would the column of engineers/band musicians that Oddball brings with him - rain or shine. And it seems unlikely they could simply have cruised unnoticed up to their destination, as they did. There would have been checkpoints. Oddball calls from a bar/cafe behind enemy lines, without so much as 'may I see your papers?'. They try to put a lot off on the confusion at the line, or front line Nazi incompetence, 'amorphous lines', whatever.O'Connor plays it up, for sure. Then maybe Archie Bunker was a bit hammy, too. Now his character probably seems more 'enjoyable', because he's so nutty. I don't know how it would have played in the 60s. McCleod, soon to be Love Boat captain, I think, is pretty annoying, playing pretty much the same shifty character he did from McHale's Navy. Rickles is good. His cynical loathing always seems like it's part of him. Sutherland's oddly 'hippie' inflected loner is not quite as well set into the film as in another of his films that year, namely MASH. I don't know if the image of a hippie running a three tank armored unit, gunning down Nazis, yes, but still soldiers just doing their job at a train station, didn't do more to rile the hippies and anti-war activists of the late 60s than it would have confirmed any of their opinions.Great music (typ. of Eastwood films, by the way), except for Stanton's harmonica playing. Odd mix of carefully overplotted heist film, western film 'realism' from the 60s and infantry WWII film (which Savalas plays up to cliche), tongue in cheek comedy and 'black comedy' (and what have I left out?) and a sense that the enemy isn't so different from ourselves, just doing their job, trying not to get shaken down or left behind, or gunned down like target ducks by Kelly's 'heroes'. When the 'other guy' is the Nazis, though, it's a tough sell. Nazis make good villians for good reason.",Null,2,4,1 August 2002
Black Hawk Down," Not quite the whole story
","Spoilers!The Battle of Mogadishu, 3 OCT 1993. The failures of General's Garrison and Montgomery are sort of glossed over as the actors that play them sort of go glassy-eyed a lot of the time. There's just the 'full responsibility' line at the end credits, and only for Garrison. The whole chain of events is confused. And it suggests just more the LA riots if more of the looters had been armed with military rifles or civilian equivalents, chasing away a few LAPD stragglers. No justice, no peace, kind of thing, as one of the clansmen actually says to the captured pilot, Durant.The blame also has been placed, in reality, on Les Aspen and Bill Clinton for refusing to equip forces with Abrams tanks and Bradley APCs. They didn't want to send the wrong 'political message' to Somali civilians, and refused to take the blame for poorly equipped forces, after the fact. But of those 500-1000 or so killed by American/UN forces in the 'extraction' effort, most surely were civilians, who would have been at less risk if the UN forces had gone in better armed with a better plan of attack. It would have been less bloody and safer for all concerned.As it is, you have Montgomery knowing that armored units were required for house to house street fighting and getting the troops in there, at least 10th Mountain or whatever support. You had Garrison go in with intelligence about on a par of that preceding the Battle of Little Big Horn. All the tanks and tracks in the stadium were not brought up to the ready, when requests for just that and more had been almost demanded by the very generals ordering the 'extraction', days and weeks before. The attention span of those generals must have been less than that of the proverbial knat not to at least incorporate what armor they had available. And that insanity is utterly missing from the movie.At any rate, the movie is a record of almost point by point how not to conduct a military operation in a house to house urban scenario, where the enemy is even just a mob. In fact, what organized 'gang activity' did face the UN forces may well have been not just armed, but directed on the ground, by members of Al-Queda cells. And the movie, furthermore, does present a somewhat clean version of the battle, I would guess. There aren't enough helicopters. The high shots of mobs in the streets were probably a little thin compared to the reality. Imagine more people, fewer guns, faster running, more confusion, etc. Just lots more people in the streets. The smoke and dust were probably worse. It was hot. They should have all been soaking in sweat. And so on. That is, the real situation was probably much worse that it is made to appear on screen, if one could imagine. 500-1000 Somalis were killed. 1000 bodies is a lot of bodies.There's also something missing that you see in other war films. And that's the gutty change of plan, the improv, the something entirely new to turn it around on the enemy. In fact, in reality, that was missing in the actual battle. They didn't give and take. They didn't have the quick retreat and regroup plan. And as the plan started to splinter, and units started to get isolated, and the intel failed, the one and only plan forced an increasingly confused execution. They didn't adjust. And I kept wondering not so much why the black hawks hovered so much, cause they did in the real battle (and it was stupid, and not just for lack of a smokescreen, or counter-measures, cover fire, etc), but why without the tanks and apcs the units still tried to run around the outskirts of town? That didn't make sense. And I don't know if it actually went that way. Why not get the cobras or a black hawk to use the cannon and rockets to clear a path through the furniture/car wreck blockades, and just drive to the crash sites? even if all they had were humvees.So, I think it's unfair to say one can't care about the characters. But they seem painted almost too mechanically, as men with guts, and bravery, but little imagination or personality; almost as if they were too green, or too young, to exhibit such. Things go wrong. And they just keep going wrong with them, instead of using their heads or being resourceful. The doc does well in that. But you almost don't see enough of him, and there are plenty of wounded.So if I'd fault the movie, overall, it wouldn't be for lack of characterization, but because I spent a couple of paragraphs explaining what the movie left out it would be lack of backstory or narrative. That's what hurts. People can't really see how they get from there to here, or what is really happening. It's all a loud muddle of small arms fire and grenades, and blood spurting. It may be the grunt's point of view that Scott was after. But maybe the movie suffers for that narrow tunnel vision. It might have been better to present the movie as a flashback from a board of inquiry, or committee investigation, to point to areas of contention, poor planning, horrible lack of coordination, exclusiveness and professional 'jealousy', and all the rest. Maybe even just a voice over. I don't know. Then one would cut to the action to see how things went so predictably wrong in hindsight. Not an uplifting film, in either case. But it might have been easier to understand.",Null,0,0,6 November 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Great film - even if technology gets dated
","Spoilers!Great film, from one of the cinema's great directors (whatever one thinks of his posthumously overhyped excuse for a film, this is still the guy behind FMJ, Clockwork, Dr. Strangelove, and just look at the list here on imdb). It holds up, sort of, even long after the heyday of new in-the-round Century dome theatres with the surround sound and audiences, as today, clamouring for something new on the screen. They got it, back then. A film ahead of its time, clearly, stuck in the styles of the day - in various ways.There's two main threads - the obelisk, and HAL. The obelisk/monolith suggests . . . ? well, we don't know, for sure. But we're surely told to infer that it represents alien intelligence (was deliberately buried there, Dr. Floyd, he says, early on - and then confirmed by the 'secret' message at the end of part III). HAL is the nightmare of machine intelligence taking over the world, as in The Matrix, here just the spaceship (but for all the 'best' of intentions - same old story, whatever 'intelligence').The look of the thing is like any good movie. They fawn over the effects, the velcro shoes, the floating pens (hey look, everyone, it's fun . . wow .. it's a threatrical release - which is fine). Poor old Dr. Floyd spends much time eating, or figuring out the zero-grav toilet (try putting up a sign like that in the lav on your average 747, today - oh, fight attendant?). He spends as much time doing that as he does acting all condescending towards everyone. You saw corporate, plastic interiors, new jet liner fashions in outer space (except for the shiny clothes, same jet liner fashions as today - not a lot of development since the 60s). The trend of the day was maybe men in space by 2000, futuristic shuttles, and so on. Little did they know . . . And also the trend in filmmaking was European, more so then, than now. Fellini, the French directors, Death playing chess, and so on. That was the 'high style'. And that lack of 'narration' is clearly found here, too. You could argue it's just Phantom Menace, from the '60s, special effects vignettes tied together long after the shoot with a poorly thrown together 'arc'. But the book, here, actually came first. Kubrick clearly DID have some sort of disconnected views, visual looks and scenes, in mind. There's a bit of the quickly stitched together movie, here. But, again, given the style of the day, I think it wasn't a desperation job as it was intentionally designed like this.Another trend of the day seems epitomized by the view of mankind as some violent ape dirtying up the beauty o Mother Earth (perhaps, maybe as seen in the pull away from the famous transition to the Blue Danube Waltz - oh, if only it weren't for people). Maybe in a post-post-modernist time, the failures of people are weighed against their virtues, more so today than in the elitist ethic of the perfectionist 60s (but who knows?). But I should say, too, that where in the past I thought the mythical 'dawn of man' sequence overdone, on later viewing I have to say Kubrick leaves in only the scenes that establish that view of man that he wanted. Just the essentials. This essential scene direction is almost a problem, as just suggested above, when Dr. Floyd and company get hit with that annoying amplified tone and we wind up looking at the Jupiter Mission, suddenly. Maybe it would NOT have been appropriate to add a short scene after the Clavius 'attack', bridging the two and establishing the Jupiter Mission. But . . . it might have helped, after all the years. Don't know.It's an epic film. It seems like four short stories tied together, but again perhaps more because of the 'essentialist' style, rather than it being four separate stories thrown together. The final story doesn't hold up so well, obviously because the effects look a bit dated. And where are the Roswell/X-Files aliens with the big eyes - right? It's all metaphor and illusion. It could mean anything, taking the movie just by itself. Could mean nothing, really - just Bowman's final delusions before he burns up. People had to leave the theatres with the big baby in space fresh in their minds saying - wow, what a great film, I didn't understand it AT ALL! The third has the classic - openapodbaydoorshal, repeated a few times, before HAL freaks out with the 'I know you were planning to 'kill' me' bit. It's really the heart of the movie, Frank and Dave in outer space, speaking in disinterested monotones, looking and acting kind of bored and shut in - the quiet of space - a little beeping here, a little whirring there - then the monster HAL strikes when they least expect.But, again, don't get me wrong. It still works, today, for whatever legitimate flaws it has, and had. The plastic models are necessarily going to look better than all but the best CGI, just as latex beats computer modeling, unless it's the best computer modeling (as in a few scenes from the original Jurassic Park, for ex.). The stars in space looked a little sparse, as we'd see them from earth, not in space - but, no problem. The opening shot of the sun not merely rising on the horizon, but over the limb of the earth, still looks good, today. And the weightlessness seemed pretty well done with a few cables and rotating sets. Have to be just top, expensive CGI to be as convincing.As for the story, of course, it gets hurt as time goes by. It looks more and more almost like an heroic effort that Kubrick managed to make it look as reasonable and believable as he did. He didn't have much to work with, perhaps. But he did give the world an interesting film, with maybe some tired old 'messages'. Lots of weird questions, even. Few answers, if any. But if it's not utterly irrelevant, then those concerns about possible life elsewhere, or more likely the threat of technology gotten away from us (the little nightmare of the toy radio car zipping over the hill and out of the ability to still control by sight), are still relevant. Some of the lines are still clever. And you can always pop out the DVD or cassette before the fourth act gets going.",Null,2,4,9 September 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Is 'rehab' indicated after viewing?
","This is a film based on a novella, Traumnovelle, written by Arthur Schnitzer in 1926, apparently concerning just the party-crashing into a dead-eyed sex party of oligarchs that is the basic plot of Kubrick's film. Kubrick has the whole mess set in and around Christmas. There are 37 scenes in the film, mostly including Tom Cruise; which is rather unfortunate (this was really a part for Jack Nicholson). Worse are the scenes of his wife, Kidmann, playing the character, Alice, not for her beautiful if somewhat undeveloped form, often shown unclothed, but for her attempt to show affection to her husband. She seems miscast, and uncomfortable. But so does he as a physician, named Dr. Bill. Sydney Pollack, as one of his wealthy patients, makes an early entrance as the host of a fancy ballroom party. Cruise recognizes a not too bright med school buddy in the piano player, one Nick Nightingale, who tells him to drop by a few weeks later at the, Sonata Cafe. He meets some dopey woman whom he saved as they talk about, rainbows. Meanwhile wife, Alice, gets drunk, seems to adopt a Melanie Griffith accent, and strikes up a conversation with a 'hungarian' actor-type who spouts Ovid, and desperately wants to show her 'sculputures', upstairs. Meanwhile Pollack calls Bill to attend to a hooker named, Mandy, sitting bare naked in a stuffed chair, having taken some sort of overdose. Bill says she is lucky to 'survive', and needs 'rehab'. Keep it confidential, says Pollack.So one evening Bill and Alice smoke pot in their underwear (it's the plot, trust me). And Alice mentions the Ovid-guy, trying to inexplicably strike up a jealousy argument. After some painfully convulsive laughter, which is apparently what pot does to Alice, she reveals that she wanted to have an affair with some Navy guy, back when, but never quite did. But she goes on and on about it to make Bill jealous.And at that very moment, jealous Bill gets a phone call to visit the apartment of a patient who just died. The daughter is there, crying, talking about an impending marriage to some professor, when she launches herself at Bill and proclaims a 'love for you'. The prof. turns out to be Greg, from Dharma and Greg, who saunters in after she has thrown herself at Bill. And Bill makes his quick exit. He takes to walking the streets, and then quickly meets a hooker, who has him to her apartment. Alice calls him on the cell, and he claims he's waiting for 'relatives to arrive'. He quickly leaves, but pays the hooker $150 anyway. And he winds up at the Sonata Cafe.Now Nick and his backing band just finish their jazz set as in walks Dr. Bill. And Nick says he has another appointment soon, which he makes out to be so mysterious that Bill is interested. Nick gets a call on his cell and writes down a word, Fidelio. He tells Bill it's a password. Bill presses him. He gives Bill the address and apparently, off camera, describes what sort of costume is expected. So Bill is off to the costume shop, apparently owned by another patient, called, Rainbow Fashions. Some other guy now runs the shop, and agrees to open at that hour for a $200 premium. But he discovers his daughter in the back with two sissy Japanese men, doing whatever. He locks the Japanese in the room, threatening to call the cops, banishes his daughter to her room, and outfits Dr. Bill with his required costume. Off Bill goes in a taxicab.He pulls up to an estate with a fancy gated entrance. He gives the password, Fidelio. And he's in. And what does he see? The well-lit 'orgy' rooms are wood paneled, sporting middle-eastern music as soundtrack, it seems. People watch satanic-type chants, in robes and masks, and then head out as if on sedatives to stand by as others disrobe and copulate. The twist is that these are all supposed to be powerful oligarchs, who cannot let their dark secret see the light of day. Dr. Bill is quickly discovered. A naked woman warns him to leave immediately. But he's called before the 'inquisition', asked the 'password for the house' (a trick question, there is none), and is then threatened. They tell him to strip, and we first hear the annoyingly childish piano tinkling as score. The woman, and from the balcony, says she'll take whatever punishment. So he leaves, apparently forgetting his mask.In short order, Nick is 'disappeared'. The hooker he didn't engage is diagnosed with AIDS. The costume shop guy has a completely mysterious turnabout, practically offering Dr. Bill his daughter. Bill's followed on the street. And the naked woman from the balcony turns up dead in the morgue. Quite the conspiracy, particularly with the annoying piano all the while (there's no mute button in a theater, just at home). And then Pollack calls him over for a chat. And Pollack lays it out. And he was there at the 'orgy'. The taxi gave away Bill, and that his rental suit still had the receipt in the pocket. He says Nick is just fine. The threats were just a lot of bold talk, with nothing behind them. And the girl was a hooker who was fine when they dropped her off, later. Like Mandy before, she was high risk, or coincidentally overdosed. So no threat, no conspiracy. The oligarchs are harmless.The final twist is that Dr. Bill returns home to find that Alice has the mask in bed with her. Alice was there, too? Who knows? But he comes clean about his 'night out'. And Alice says, in the closing scene, that 'forever' is too long a time to promise, but that they should at least be grateful they 'survived' their 'adventures', and need 'rehab' (well, they don't say that - that's just for the surviving audience).",Null,0,1,11 December 2005
The Da Vinci Code," The grail is what again? and it's . . . where?
","This is one of those films that you don't know to ask for your money back until it's mostly over. Only then do you realize the full scope of how brainless it all was, and how you were cheated.Tom Hanks is interesting in the part, though dull. The casting seems otherwise good. The French do suggest a little unintentional comedy. But maybe that's just a French thing.There are those I've heard say - gee, it really makes you think. And they'll turn around two minutes later and say - just fiction and whatchya complain-an about, it's just a movie? So, until such folk get their heads in working order, I'll just suggest that the plot is insane. The tomb of Magdelene is supposed to be buried in the little pyramid under the glass pyramid fairly recently built in the courtyard of the Louvre Museum. And the Tom Hanks character doesn't want to upset 'organized religion' by telling anyone, I suppose. So that's why they built that ugly glass pyramid (as bad guy #1 called it). Had to be a reason. Of course, the real whopper is not that there is this line of offspring, which just coincidentally, we'll say, happens to end with a girl - because imagine how the plot would look if it were a guy - from Jesus Christ. It's that Jesus Christ was just a man, just a prophet. There's a number of sects that believe that, like the Freemasons, and the Muslims, and any number of heretics in the Church's past. Jesus was just some good guy - who literally claimed to be God, Himself. So he was just a good guy, who was completely out of his mind. He was great teacher of morality, who fornicated with Magdalene, or then secretly married her to make it all legal. And then there are Catholics, and Protestants and Greek Orthodox who obviously believe otherwise.As with pretty much the same supposed conspiracy said to be concealed by thousands and thousands over the millenia as proposed by Kazantzakis, also made into a film, and the same as with Lincoln's original Holy Blood myth from which Brown's fiction is wholly lifted, despite what a court may have ruled, what's sort of sad when watching this is not that the film just seems to drag on and on, it's not that the camera occasionally bounces all around, or that it screens like a book when they first elude capture, etc., but that people actually spend their lives coming up with these kind of conspiracy theories. To imagine that this described the early Church, the Apostles and disciples who literally were tortured and martyred, that of course is the classic argument against this, or similar notions.As for the Priority of Sion stuff, this group of four that is murdered by McKellen who are trying to protect the female descendant, and the supposed 'grail', which in this myth isn't the cup at Valencia Cathedral, but the corpse of St. Mary Magdalene, this 'Priory' was admitted to be a hoax perpetrated in recent decades by a couple of guys, a con-man named, Pierre Plantard, and his buddy, Philippe de Cherisey. As for the Opus Dei involvement in the plot, that may come closest to the truth. The cult is not necessarily orthodox, and has been otherwise seen as heterodox, but it seems even more just to be a group which is very opportunistic, and really just out for itself, and power. It's a shadowy group, no question. It's considered dangerous by many traditional 'religious' Catholics. Whether any Opusites wear monk costumes is another thing, as is whether it's just a group of psychotic assassins, as Brown would have it.If one wants a real conspiracy, a real threat to Catholicism, it's been in the news and in front of everyone - since at least the mid-1960s. It's the changes made in virtually everything, and blamed on Vatican II by the very 'reformers' themselves. There's a line that one of the bad guys, played by McKellen, says, or keeps saying. People ignore what's right in front of them. But what people see, and don't want to see, is this 'reformist' destruction on the inside (not necessarily including altering the appearance of Da Vinci's Last Supper), and which extends to the Protestant denominations, as well, and all the while the anti-Church conspiratist nuts keep pounding away with Holy Blood myths, and Gnostic gospels. That's the danger. It's 'world church reform'. Watering down. There's your threat, not in the deep desire of Kazantzakis and others that Jesus Christ be some sort of guy who can't keep his pants on. Such notions are so ridiculous, and so trivial in the face of the real threat, and what's really going on. In fact, one wouldn't be surprised with the desire of these newChurchers, who speak like secular feminists in everything, to believe that St. Magdalene wasn't really a Saint, but was rather the Incarnation, herself. Considering how far gone they are, already, that would just be one more against them on the list of offenses to both God, and The Church which He founded. If that's what 'making one think' is what anyone means who says it, hopefully it will.Now, if Ron Howard ever made a film about the life of a Catholic Saint, that might be a sure sign that one could use ice skates in hell. But he'd probably go Oliver Stone one better and have the Saint dream of 'sexing' Jesus while discovering that The Church has been concealing the 'truth' that Pius X was a ten year old girl, name John - Joan. abbr. in Latin - who had good make-up people to make her appear old. Dakota Fanning as the Pope. Teen Pope. Coming soon. After all - it's just a movie!",Null,0,2,24 May 2006
Titanic," Truly brilliant - and the nth time viewing . . it sucks!
","Spoilers! (ahahh-ahh!! .. rememberin the late Sam K)This is a film which simply doesn't hold up upon repeated viewing. In fact, this is the only film I have, that I purchased, that seemed to get palpably worse each time I viewed it. Really, it SHOULD have won the Oscar. It's big budget, it has some good acting, great innovative effects, costumes and so on. Great film. But then it was a very weak year (has been for a couple of years).Maybe it's that the sob scenes are SO calculated, that the effect or novelty is exposed 2nd/3rd time around. Maybe the flying prow scene just seemed too set-up. Maybe, truly, after seeing the film, the next time, or time after that, when you see it, you think of the real deal, the real ship, the real sinking, and wonder if the Irwin Allen treatment, here, isn't just a little too cynical and a little bit too much blood-money for the film-makers? I don't know.The 'docu-scenes' that bracket the film will probably hold up the best. The 'Heaven' scene depends on the emotion sweeping you up, and that of course is lost on repeat viewing (but that would be expected). If the film were about something fantastical, unbelievable, wild adventure or weird sci-fi, it could be viewed over and over without a thought given to reality. If it were a character play, from Jane Austen to Shakespeare, it could be repeatedly view precisely for the insights into reality, and appreciated for the fantasy, as well. But this is just Poseidon Adventure, with superficial character studies, and a quick sinking (cause it was) that leaves little time for Shelley Winters, er (whoever), to put in a 'just help me get off of this tub', performance (or was 'Jack' playing Shelley Winters? - ?).Almost gave the film away to a friend. Almost threw it out. Was surprized I still had it on the shelf. Don't plan to view it anytime soon.",Null,2,3,23 October 1999
The Godfather: Part III," Good in part - but not necessarily as The Godfather
","SPOILERS!A good film, in two parts. If this had been the only Godfather ever released, it might have been up for the academy award. That's all on its own; particularly as it was a 1990 film, and films were starting to get a tad weaker, in general, by that point.But it a) must not necessarily be seen as a sequel to the Godfather, and b) it might be seen as the most 'operatic' or Shakespearian of the bunch. It's not the sequel because it's no longer really the Puzo series, and the characters seem a bit different. The Godfather characters are sort of borrowed for this film, you could say. And I thought of classic drama and opera as soon as the assassin was introduced. He's sort of Shakespeare's simultaneously clumsy and comical competent killer.What gets weird is the Vatican Bank story leeching into the election of JP I. We are to believe that Don Corleone has a private confession with the cardinal before he is elected Pope; and of course, the Don in short order goes ahead and orders the purge of assorted gangsters, just like he did in the previous film. But . . . And we are further to believe that an archbishop conspirator in the scandal literally poisoned the tea of JP I, and killed him. Now the poison in the drink is also the stuff of classic drama. And I'd take it for that. But as history, it seems laughable. Don Michael's order in the movie end purge literally includes this evil renegade archbishop, to the point of having some gunman lurking in the shadows shoot him, in the Vatican, as he walks up a winding staircase. The cardinal is seen plummeting over the side and falling down onto the worm's eye camera in the gallery below. Again - operatic, yes. Metaphorical fiction, sure. Characters as types even more than characters - yes. A Godfather I and II, not really. The play is the almost comical (yes, that's right) who gets 'hit' first, almost Shakespearian black comedy, as Ma Corleone goes for the other Don, the other Don goes for Don Michael, maybe the Pope, and the other Corleones hit the hitters, and so on. It all happens simultaneously, as the bunch sit there watching the opera. You have the quick cut to the action happening elsewhere (which is a Godfather trademark technic, to be fair).I said two parts because the best part seems all these scenes when the family goes to Italy. I think it might have been much better if they'd gone easy on the old mob stuff, frankly, cut out much of the first part, and gone quicker to Italy, stayed with the story there longer, and developed the estrangment and reconciling of father and son - which brought the cast to Italy, to the opera. That part not only isn't developed, it's pretty much not even present - which is a little startling. The final revenge is just sort of dashed off, even after a private confession with the man soon to become Pope. That's just forgotten. That's hard to believe. It might have benefitted from a little of the emoting of the Don's final scream as dear Mary is accidentally shot by the goofy but dangerous assassin, rather than just a calm - hey, let's get revenge.Of course, such a suggested movie would be even more of a departure from Godfather I and II than this film was. But it seems that's the direction 'Francis' wanted to go, but didn't have the guts, perhaps, to go all the way. As for his daughter in the role, she obv. had trouble with the acting. But it wasn't that bad. As for Keaton, she just didn't seem all there, like she was just reading her lines. As for Shire, I thought she was good - same for Garcia. I thought the cameo by now SF Mayor Willie Brown was appropriate, trying to line up crooked judges. As for Pacino, himself, I kept flashing on Dick Tracy given his delivery of some of those lines. But again . . hey. As for a comparison with the contemporaneous Goodfellas, this film shows more the uselessness of gangsterism than the off and on glorification found in Scorsese's somewhat less than epic film. The best scene in this regard might be the final scene. Long shot of the 90ish (?) near death husk of the great Don Michael, who 'never wanted to be Don', sitting next to a dilapidated Italian villa on a folding chair or something, reading the paper, just going limp and falling off the chair - dead. End of story, cut to credits. That's it. That's what his life amounted to. Regrets and remorse of his daughter's murder filling his thoughts. Maybe even a life never really even lived. Seemed more telling than anything in Scorsese's film.",Null,0,1,31 May 2000
It's a Wonderful Life," Classic, often overlooked, film
","People think of Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, Oz, Godfather, Patton, Sound of Music, even Duck Soup - whatever. They forget this.This is a witty, sharply written drama, the antithesis of socialism to answer others here, about the triumph of good over evil, of conservative stability and justice over corruption. The entire town, the whole world, has more soul, is better off, with George around to help counter gross misunderstanding and greedy manipulations of the 'the system'.Potter doesn't believe in people. He doesn't ultimately believe his own rhetoric. But George shares his father's belief that people can better themselves, through hard work, diligence, but with the corruption of 'Potter's rules' removed as a barrier. George represents the American Dream, as always understood. Potter is the oppressive evil that imagines itself to be 'more equal' than everyone else, whether represented as the self-satisfied oligarch or the 'Barbary Coast' decadence of Potterville, with its 'workers slums'. George represents the spirit of self-sacrifice, putting his own dreams aside so that others might thrive, so that 'the system' works for people, and not against them. It's the will of the middle class aspiring not just to home additions, and third cars, but to long-lasting, just and peaceful stability and appreciation of others, shown in so many ways.But there is bitterness. George does the right thing, but still bears a burden. And when his 'silly Billy' literally hands Potter the bank's cash, George is furious and begins to forget that he is loved and admired for putting his faith in others. The irony is that he succumbs to a host of misunderstandings, himself, which is precisely what his role in the community has tended to cure when it comes to others. At his lowest, he loses faith in them by losing faith in himself. And in that confusion, enter the angel.Here's the twist on Dicken's A Christmas Carol. And the angel shows how people suffer, not because of a man's life, Scrooge, but if that man never lived, George Bailey. Without the need to retell A Christmas Carol in that way, they could have cut immediately to the party at the house, and the cash, all the credit, but no angel would have 'gotten its wings'.The Christmas Carol angle is there not just so that George sees that he is loved but so that we see the same in our friends and relatives. The lesson is that even in little things, like the boring life of running some small town savings and loan (cause they still had those), not only might he be better off, but so is everyone who has benefited from being associated with him.It's no coincidence that such a film, and such a message, is associated with Christmastime.",Null,1,6,24 December 2006
Jaws," Classic film, Spielberg's first hit and arguably Spielberg's best
","The fearsome cartoon shark, Bruce, from Finding Nemo wouldn't have exited without Jaws. So many people's fear of the ocean, and particularly shark infested waters near otter and seals (such as up and down the California coast), wouldn't be what it still is (save for the gotta-cowabunga surfer-dudes), thirty years later, if not for this blockbuster summer hit that was Spielberg's breakthrough film.The 26 foot great white is introduced slowly, as a blur killing the little boy, more as bird's eye under the water killing the guy in the 'pond', but fully at the stern of the Orca, at last, and which then proceeds to attack the boat and its crew as if this fish were the equal of Rommel writing on tank tactics, and were as unstoppable as any terminator juggernaut - four barrels!, says Shaw's Quint, in disbelief. The barrels represent the shark, of course, when they pop to the surface (a sort of black humor).Schieder as the chief is very believable. Spielberg said he looked to cast an elderly Sterling Hayden, the nutty general from Kubrick's, Dr. Strangelove. But Hayden had other plans. Schieder is good. Dreyfuss is the same, for a guy whose characters veer into the annoying. He gets excited, and sometimes doesn't know what to say to bullies. But he's brave, at the last, and shows that he is paying attention. And Shaw's Quint does the same. Sure, he has the bluster of one who just doesn't like or trust people, as with the classic nails-on-the-blackboard scene where he negotiates his price of ten thousand, which eventually they pay. But when Dreyfuss tells Schieder to watch it, on the Orca, or else tip over some compressed air tanks (to introduce the essential plot resolution, later), after sort of dismissing Dreyfuss, Shaw in more hushed tones tells Schieder's character to watch it, as well - ask if you don't know what you're doing. So he's paying attention. But the character flaw of Quint, suggested by his general demeanor and craziness, is that he copes poorly under stress. He just flakes out. He becomes dangerously unglued. One could only imagine his difficulty in the water after the sinking of the Indy in WWII, which his character in this story was said to suffer.As for the script, it seems much was opportunistic. Spielberg was up against it. Things weren't going well, it seemed. He thought they might stop production, and that would be it - and his career it might have turned out. But as others have pointed out, and I think Spielberg's friend and close collaborator, George Lucas, should take note, the success of the film was due not merely to the outstanding and appropriate score, but to what you didn't see on screen. It succeeded not because of the hard fought effort to get the effects to work, but because for the longest time, they didn't, forcing the filmmakers to improvise. What you got, instead, was an almost clean, theatrical encouragement to imagination - film-making as substitute for radio serials. Crissy, the opening victim, doesn't even seem to bleed. Something is happening to her, but there are no bloodpacks in the mouth, as later with Quint, when you've already seen the shark. She just, literally, gets jerked back and forth and is pulled under. It's much the same for the mannequin, the remains of the fisherman found in the dead of night as Dreyfuss confesses that he's rich and bought that boat/yacht, himself. The dead head is obviously a prop. But the reaction shot, the pacing, and importantly that Spielberg has your suspension of disbelief at that point, might make it work. At lot is left to the imagination for you to ignore that it's obviously a prop, a dummy.Looking on the shark, now, in 2006, it's difficult not to see that it's obviously a mechanical prop. But in 1975, if you'd said to most people, they're building a large mechanical shark, people might have said - why? Great whites were known to those who would know. Those around Martha's Vineyard knew, of course - and that it didn't work, most of the time. But I think to most, this was the introduction of a creature they didn't know existed. So caught up in the film's suspense, the pacing, the direction, I think it was easily possible not to see this as a mechanical thing, but literally by imagination to overlook the obvious and make it seem what it was supposed to be - a live, gigantic, smart as an elephant, shark. But again, fortunately for the filmmakers, the fake shark was broken much of the time. And some of the key underwater footage was of real great whites, sometimes attacking a small model of the shark cage, scaled down. And Spielberg even shot a few brief shots of 'Dreyfuss' in the cage at the very last in someone's swimming pool.There are a couple of key scenes. The set up for the shark eating the guy in the dingy, in the 'pond', apparently goes to some theme of the novel of the greedy businessmen who would overlook their civic duty and responsibility for the sake of not shutting down business on the big holiday. And then the 'shark fin' attacks, the frightened adults paw over the kids floating in their way, and trample the oldsters who can't get out of their way.Another is the first view of the shark, showing that it is as big as the boat. That's the key scene because Quint jumps into attack mode, rather than abide the advice that they should retire from the scene - they need a bigger boat. This isn't a shark - it's Moby Dick.And the last, obviously, was the one set up by the air tanks falling. Jaws bites one, holds it in its mouth, and policeman Scheider gets off a lucky shot. Otherwise, the movie ends as it should have ended.",Null,1,3,31 October 2006
Scream," Creepy film
","Desensitization, on a couple of levels - but really only the most painful, and superficial. The plot concerns Billy (Ulrich/Depp - could have sworn it was Johnny Depp, or Johnny Depp playing James Dean - I don't know - Ulrich probably gets a lot of that) and Stu's acting out their obsession with horror films, shared by friend Randy, who is not quite as far gone as Billy and Stu. It's Columbine, 1999, in effect; although other school shootings took place before and since the release of this movie for Christmas 1996 (according to IMDb). Like those real life killers, this movie tries to portray real life killers of its own who have lost their sense of self, from whatever personal grief and problems, to the horror film genre. They now consider real life to be a movie, but perhaps just without all the horror/slasher film 'rules' that Randy would place on it.Williamson, in the trailer/documentary, says that a horror movie, particularly the 'slasher' film I would guess, is therapeutic and a good emotional release. Bates didn't really kill anyone in Psycho. It was just a movie. It's always just a movie. Movies never encourage actions or influence real life. Oh - of course. Laugh, scream and hold each other tight. It does at least encourage that. But the problem with Scream is that it's a movie about . . movies. The characters actually discuss the corn syrup blood. And right after that, they expect the audience to believe that's not corn syrup and sound effects in the next scene. (It was the problem in the adventure/comedy with Tim Allen about space aliens - one minute, in the studio, next minute it's supposed to be real? why? walk us through it, Mr. director) And if the whole thing is phony, and seen as phony, and known to be, and so much of it is telegraphed, if there's no real expectation that the audience will suspend their disbelief, but rather sit in the director's chair behind the lights spouting clichés and watching the cameraman, then I think it bothers me. It's a depiction of what's supposed to be, in some way, a murder conspiracy involving two vicious serial killers. And yet it's played for . . laughs, for entertainment. It's a bit lazy. It's no Hitchcock. And that wasn't the subtext in Psycho, either; or in Silence of the Lambs, for that matter. The excuse, here, would be that because it's not real, these aren't political prisoners fed to the lions in the arena, for example. Murder can be entertainment, when it's fake. Just so it's not that sort of murder. This isn't Auschwitz. The actors are not wearing stars. It cannot desensitize.Well, golly, sure it can. If some say this film doesn't cause one to identify with the killers, possibly they're wrong. The killers not only see life as a film. They see themselves as part of the cast. But because this is a wink at movies, and the horror/slasher film specifically, the audience sees the killers as actors in a film, and literally as part of the cast - as they playact at random human slaughter, discussing horror movies, all the while. It's real. It's not. It's all in good fun, as the obviously fake bodies, and scenarios, hang around and goof around, and lay around until they pop up again as if at a Halloween haunt at the local amusement park. No one dies. There is no death. As the killers basically say - life is just as unreal as a movie.Looked at another way, the plot is simple, as Randy says is a hard and fast rule. But it's not a rule, in . . other horror classics, apart from the exploitation flicks they take care to mention. This film is sloppy. And the 'cleverness' is meant to disguise that failing. Silence of the Lambs was simple, in a way - but not stupid. Scream is not supposed to be Airplane '1996', either. And yet it has more in common with that sort of thing, or with a Wayans Bros. comedy, than Silence of the Lambs. The opening scene, with Drew Barrymore, plays like a fiction, from the start. You expect to zoom out to see people in a theatre, or that the protagonist is merely writing a novel (and that is briefly the suggestion in the following scene). The film gets off to a bad start just trying to establish that these murders were part of the protagonist's reality. And it gets more confusing, in scene after scene. And what exactly . . is . . the point of the father - who just gets tossed in, perhaps as the embodiment of yet another horror flick 'rule'? He goes crazy and kills half the town? That's the killer's plan to frame him? And so on.A movie within a movie doesn't seem to work for just any film. It might work in an old musical. It might work as some annoying flashback (which are often overdone). But if that, rather than the killer pair, is the real gimmick of this movie, then a movie long joke about whether it is or it isn't fails simply because everyone knows it . . . isn't (and can remember the cost of the ticket/vid/DVD). Maybe, in that light, it's therapeutic (for potential serial killers)? I don't know. Maybe it's just sick. Maybe it's a depiction of a certain disturbed, homicidal, lunatic geek fringe, and not intended to be a suggestion for behavior even to same? It's creepy on so many levels. Maybe the same audience would appreciate, 'SAW II'. I just don't know.",Null,0,1,11 December 2005
Iron Man," Meets the hype - unusual accomplishment for a summer blockbuster
","Spiderman was good. Batman was good until the 'Prince parade' scene. And now Iron Man.I almost went in not wanting to like the film. Robert Downey is not exactly a popular Hollywood star. JF is not a great director (he casts himself as a supporting player in early scenes). And the promos featured Sabbath's song, which I though would be inappropriate at anything but the closing credits. Sure enough, that's where it was, all the way at the LONNNNNGGG closing credits - what were there? 100, 200, 300 stuntmen, stunt drivers, stunt extra, stunt directors, I don't know? I've never seen credits that long. And the teaser was that if you sat through the longest run of movies credits ever, you'd see a 2min clip suggesting a sequel.In short, the clip is that our hero comes into his high ceiling 'living'/oceanview room, and there's a black guy with an eye patch who identifies himself as, Nick Fury. He says he has something to do with National/Homeland security, and that Stark is not the 'only hero'. So the sequel is about government agents in Ironman suits? Still, if JF can produce even 3/4 the film he did here in the sequel, that too will be some accomplishment.The plot of Ironman is that Stark is a technological genius/phenom. He can engineer and build a Learjet from two scraps of paper and a bottle of Sprite. McGiver has nothing on him. His dad was a munitions maker who went into the government-contract game with the heavy, played by Jeff Bridges (I just couldn't help flashing back to Big Z from the surfing penguin movie - his voice was so memorable).Dad dies, off camera, and the young Stark is in it with Bridges, both self-righteously touting their defense of freedom by superior weaponry - which is fine as far as it goes. But our hero is naive, and doesn't realize that the enemy can grab up weapons on the field of battle, too. Sure enough, on a sales tour to Iraq, his motorcade is hit and he is captured. And sure enough, the bad guys have a bunch of equipment from his company. He even asks, where did you get 'my' guns.Perhaps it's best to think of Jr. Stark as an idiot savant. He builds an ironman suits from discarded rocket parts, basically. His captors know who he is and want him to construct the weapons he had just sold on his sales tour. But it gets to the point where his suit doesn't look anything like the rockets he's supposed to be building.In fact, the core technology is some sort of reactor. He builds a small version, with parts on hand. And somehow it gives his suit 'super-powers'. He can sustain flight with chemical boosters far longer than there is chemical in the boosters (that he can fly, period, with no control surfaces is bizarre). He is equipped with flame throwers that make the jets from the old island hopping WWII tanks look like toys. And so on. But it's only a prototype. He makes his escape. But he lands a short distance away. He wanders the desert. He gets rescued. But the bad guys find the remnants of the suit.Cut to chase, he returns home a changed man. He wants a bigger and better suit. Turns out partner, Bridges, is really a psycho, who is invited by the bad guys to Iraq to view the suit. His bad guys kill all those bad guys. And he works on his own suit, sort of the bigger, badder 'robocop', that we've seen before.Stark's girl Friday, Miss Potts, discovers the secret of area 16 and the super-suit. She gets government agents to close in. But Bridges dons the suit, kills some of them, and goes after her. Sure enough, Stark/Ironman flies in to save the day, and is almost killed himself.One place where perhaps the film goes off-note is when Bridges team so effortlessly kills the bad Arabs who had been threatening locals with Stark's weapons. It's a little too easy. Should have been a fight. And the other is the big plot hole as to why Stark needs a hole in his chest. At first, it was to prevent shrapnel from sinking into vital tissues. But he could have had that fixed upon his returns. He continues to wear the reactor in his chest, which is how he 'powers' his suits. And it's not explained why the reactor is there, or could itself be damaging soft tissues with radiation. Bridges 'super-robo' suit uses the same reactor. And he doesn't have to wear it in his chest.But apart from that, it's interesting to see the tie in to the terrorist problem in Iraq and frontier regions there. It's interesting to see the sets. The pacing is good. The acting is fine. Marvel and JF did quite a job with this. But, dang, those are some long closing credits.",Null,3,6,2 June 2008
Tombstone," Almost - not quite
","Spoilers!A Val Kilmer showcase - though to be fair Holliday was an interesting character; doomed with incurable tb, out west (or Puerto Rico for awhile?) trying to live as a doomed man, always a step ahead of the law or actually escaping arrest, violent, crooked, mean, but a friend of the Earps.I think the Russell portrayal of Wyatt was fair enough, and reading Wyatt's accounts and testimonies, it's probably how Earp saw himself. Might have been nice to tie in the Wells Fargo angle, particularly as they went to the trouble to have an office in the town for the movie.The gang was broadly portrayed, too, though you never saw them rob a stage, just generally cut up in town. You never saw the HQ ranches - making them the 'first gang', the 'cowboys', etc. And the owners of the Clanton Ranch, today, have their own take on things, suggested in the film, as well.And the fight seems fairly described, with some of the gang unarmed, and Doc doing most of the shooting. Why they were waiting in the alley still seems something for speculation, considering it may have been just across the street from the window of Doc's hotel room. But, basically, this and the set up and Wyatt heading the posse later, is pretty much fact.What's missing is the feel of that period in the old west. The costumes are too flowery, the lighting is not Arizona or NM, the buildings look both too clean and too modern, save maybe for the Grand Hotel, and so on. And of course, the Dana Delaney 'love interest' seems tossed in, though it is important to the film's plot.And worse, the feel of the situation itself isn't developed. What about the friendships and animosities? It seems as if the background had to occur only in town, that old friends could only get together in town, that the threats and fights - in town. But these guys, good and bad, got around. And not everything happened - in town - unless I guess one wanted to shoot a Hollywood movie pretending its Tombstone.It seemed at times more an outline for movie than a movie, more an attempt to try and stay with the historical fact while superficially blending in Hollywood cliches, rather than just telling the story of the feud, of that 'gang family', true to the beliefs of the day, the expectations of that time, and even the look and feel of Tombstone and outlying ranches.The movie seemed more cut/view, buy it/reshoot, and so on, than a smooth telling of the story of the Earps and the Clanton gang.",Null,0,1,9 March 2000
Signs," Faith-test film that gets a bit cheesy
","Good performances by all. Weird and failed script, though. The film uses space aliens to test one man's Faith in Catholicism. Apparently, a defrocked priest, played by Gibson, takes a wife and has three children. Since the priestly character is never erased, I'm not sure the Church, at least of the past, would have blessed such a union. But these are confusing religious times, and particularly for Gibson in his own real life.So along come the aliens. And in a flashback, an Indian friend of his (played by M. Knight himself) down the road is spooked by one of the aliens at night, locks the baddie in a pantry closet, gets in his car and proceeds to speed wildly down the road until he hits Gibson's wife who was out for a walk. She's alive when he gets there, and has advice for the kids - particularly for the oldest, 'see the signs'. She probably didn't mean the space aliens who set in motion the events of her death.Meanwhile, in a previous scene, Gibson has met the Indian friend who is fleeing the area for a lake - the aliens don't like water, he says. And he apologizes - I'm just soooooo sorry - again for killing his wife. Presumeably, with all the space aliens around blocking what at the time were analog TV and radio signals, the guy was released. So he takes off for the lake.And that's the test. Gibson says he's lost the Faith. He dutifully blames God, sez I'ze-hates-ya, and whatever else. It's all God's fault. Yet there's miraculous deliverance at the end. And Mr. defrocked, living in sin, apparently takes up the collar again and goes - where? Does this 'Catholic' have his own ministry, his own separate congregation (sort of like . . well, like Mel has)? Test - test passed? I . . guess. Was that the plot M. Knight?And then the aliens are gone. While there, they were War of the Worlds types, sneaking about and trying to capture people. A film about on par with this except for all the fx, the Cruise remake of WotW pretty much depicts the space aliens of this film, as well, at least in terms of behavior.But M. Knight should have stuck with Wells. He made sense. Bacteria and viruses. That might even sneak into a suit, which they didn't even wear in the Cruise film. Here, they're never seen but for a glimpse in sunlight. But they look like grey mummies just out of the sarcophagus. Either that's their moldy all-together, or that's one goofy space-suit.At any rate, apparently their Achilles heel is water, even just a few drops. People here have pointed out the difficulty with that. Put a few drop of water on them, 'suit' or no, and it's like stomach acid or something. But, they attack a planet that's mostly - water. They fly around in spaceships at an altitude with cloud vapor - water. They hang around in the middle of the night and early morning. Water. Early morning dew. And where they reach out violently to grab people in some scenes, when Gibson is strolling through his field of corn at night with only a sometimes working flashlight, apparently with aliens hiding all around, not one single grab. I guess M. Knight must have thought light scared 'em before he hit on water.Such a cheesy film. This M. Knight was once thought to be a great director about to make a name for himself. And I think Signs was even well-reviewed at first. Looking at it now . . .",Null,4,6,11 October 2009
Munich," Assassination, paranoia, and his blind critique of eye for an eye
","I agree that this was an effort from a man working out his feelings about the state of Israel. It wasn't good, at any rate. The disaster of German special forces in Munich, still a national embarrassment, certainly, as were any initial reports that all the hostages had survived, is restaged for this fim in flashback clips - not all at once. At the beginning, at points inbetween, and at the end of this film, you have to remember to piece it all together in your head as the hero of our story suffers some sort of out of body experience, as if he'd been there in the midst of the hostages. I also agree with the complaint that Spielberg is crazy to have this unexplained supernatural phenomenon occur while at the end of the film the hero has sex with his wife, and just doesn't stop.The plot is basically that some frat-boy type Americans smooth the way for the terrorists into the dorms by hopping the gate along with them. The terrorists unpack their weapons and assault the Israeli athletes still in their rooms. One fights back, kills or wounds a terrorist, but is mowed down by AK47 fairly quickly. Looks like one escaped. And a total of two were gunned down. As for the nine remaining, Germany readily agrees to the terrorists demands and makes choppers ready at the airport. They don't mean it, of course. The hostages are held together in a tight group with the terrorists, who all mount up into the choppers, at which point the German's just unload on everyone. And the terrorists are shown gunning down the hostages, and tossing the grenades into the choppers. But you don't see a lot of the last bit except at points through the film, and at the end, as already noted.In retaliation, we have Golda Meir sitting down with the generals in her home to recruit a former bodyguard to head up a team of assassins. She gives essentially a speech about civilized societies necessarily doing uncivilized things to survive, and so on. And the job of these assassins is to kill the organizers of the Munich assault, or generally the leadership of Black September. The government creates a 'deniable deniability', a Swiss bank account with American cash periodically deposited in safe deposit boxes. And off they go. But not before the 'handler', a rather confused jerk, insists that Golda attended the funeral of her sister rather than the official ceremony for the slain athletes because many Israelis held her responsible for not negotiating with terrorists - she didn't want to get booed. Spielbergs says, don't know about history.So they start with a few names, though none of the team is quite sure how they fit into Munich. Over the months they spend millions for information. And then they shoot some, bomb some, and so on, a total of five or six figures connected with international terrorism. Meanstwhile, on the ever-present TV, there are reports of hi-jackings and cafe bombings, etc., where hundreds have been killed. These are supposedly in retaliation for what the assassins have done, not for anything Israel was doing in Lebanon or wherever else. So Spielberg wants us to know - direct cause - and this is the balance sheet. Hundreds vs. five, or six.And sure enough, the assassins begin to have questions. Why are we doing this? Are we not righteous Jews? The bombmaker, in particular complains of that, and wants out. It apparently never occurred to them, when they began this cell operation that assassins - kill people. Apparently they only realized that after they killed people, and only then start in about being righteous or not. And look at all the hundreds that died because we killed these few - again, part of Spielberg's message. Essentially, he seems to want to say - what's the point, can't we all just get along? There's a stairwell scene, where this team shares a 'nightmarish pad' with some PLO types, both sent to this 'safe house' by a French information broker getting hundreds of thousands of US greenbacks for each tip, and selling one side against the other, basically. And the PLO type, thinking our hero is just some Communist German stooge, apologetic even for the Nazi past and therefore sympathetic to Israel, says - you reds never quite get it, but you've got homes to go to. We Palestinians will fight for our land, even if it is left to my sons, or to their sons to do so. Brave talk, calling to mind the very struggle to create Israel itself. Spielberg wants us to see that, I think. Death to Israel, forever! And that's how the movie concludes, as well, from the other side - Israel, forever! The hero's Mom is sort of aware of what her son was doing. But she gives much the same speech, that we'll do anything to keep this, our land, no matter how unjust or unprofessional. You are our hero, son. Remember the PLO guy, mentioned. Spielberg has homes, and homes like few Americans will ever see. He probably feels like some land baron. He's now vested in that order, and protecting it; even if it means more taxes because it's all just money-tree money to him. He's got an endless supply. Spielberg probably can see his own zealotry for the Democrat Party when it's election time. Perhaps. But fierce religious and nationalistic zealotry seems to be lost on him, or scares him as simply destabilizing. Perhaps he's yet to discover that he's a closet Republican? But he's not stupid. And neither were those who knew what assassination meant before they set out.",Null,0,3,9 March 2006
The Matrix," Plot holes aplenty, but lots of action - typical movie
","Spoilers!Story, on a classic premise, about smart machines taking over the world, sometime in the future. Humanity is utterly enslaved, bred merely for bio-electrical energy for the machines; people growing and dying in little bowls of slime, with tubes connected throughout their body and probes into their brains, the bowls stacked miles high like Christmas lights strung down a tall electrical pole. The idea is that the machines create a dream world, a fantasy world for these millions of 'battery' people, these people lying still under the slime, practically comatose their entire lives, so that they will in fact take many years to live out their lives content in the belief they ARE living their lives and all is normal - just a means of extending 'battery' life, as it were. And the fantasy chosen is the world from the last part of the 20th century. And the fantasy world is called - the Matrix. It's elaborate and confusing, and so there's a LOT of narrative in this film - understandably a little too much. The tag line is that you can't explain the matrix - you have to see it. But I think I just explained it. (?)The good guys are an organized resistance, operating in gigantic sewers under what had been the cities, all bombed out now, flying what look like spaceships, one assumes lingering from the ultimate fight with the machines as they were taking over - but it's suggested the resistance movement began afterward (?). Somehow, this resistance retains their futuristic ships and weapons; each ship operating as an independent cell, tied to the last city of free people - which we never see - called, Zion. Somehow, this resistance manages to enter back into the matrix, at will, to communicate with other members of the resistance, to recruit new members, trying to avoid detection.Most of the good scenes, the sf/x stuff, occur when they are in this dream state, in the matrix. But the sf/x, in the real world, for some floating robot hunter/killers, called 'sentinels', which go after the resistance space ships, make these 'sentinels' look all too CGI. They look like part of the dream, and it's confusing, cause they are supposed to exist in - reality. Just unconvincing effects, is all.The hero is ultimately able to somehow ignore the dream, make it dance to his tune, and frustrate the machines, thereby - at least in the matrix. It's not that bad guy and good alike don't alter the dream reality - cause the good guys fly through the air and the bad guys also make lips grow together. But the hero does it to the extent of practically busting up the dream itself. He's the 'chosen one', as it were. In the real world, the resistance ships use EM pulses to disable the machines - and why machinedom can't trace an EM burst to its source, I don't know. Ultimately, the matrix is thwarted by the hero, or is just about to be by film's end. How this disables machinedom, itself, isn't explained. Why the machines wouldn't just reprogram, as they admitted to doing once before, isn't explained. Etc.
If fact, it isn't explained why people are bred. Are cattle too big? Are rabbits too small? In the slime, people in this constant matrix dream don't use their muscles at all. When the hero is rescued by the resistance from his bowl, it takes days to rebuild his atrophied muscles, using future technology. What kind of energy does a body utterly undeveloped generate? It would seem the machines would be pumping everyone full of steroids, and having them run a treadmill every other hour of the day in their 'reality'. Or better yet - why not breed Brahma bulls? I guess the answer is that there couldn't be the story, or the struggle, if people had already been x-ed out of the picture.I suppose the most interesting thing about the film are the effects. And a few mini-documentaries follow the flick, which explain the burgeoning idea of 'virtual photography' (in this film, a rapid cascade of still cameras along some path, when motion is the necessary artifact of the method), when another shows the storyboards and some rough CGI of scenes from the film, another how they trained in the martial arts, and so on.Interesting film, in some ways. But if you think _too_ much about it, it makes less and less sense. As for casting Reeves, he does seem a little overly bewildered sometimes, and one wonders how a Samuel Jackson would have done in the role, or someone else; save that the hero is supposed to be some younger nerd/hacker type in the dream/matrix. Reeves gives sort of a Harrison Ford everyman showing, but without the same edge or character Ford always had (even in his Gunsmoke villain days). Then again, they could have cast Leo DeCaprio or David Schwimmer in the lead - so . . . could have been worse.",Null,0,0,7 February 2000
Click," The old formula still brings a tear
","The retelling of a Christmas Carol, even more than It's a Wonderful Life, by resort to a gadget - a supernatural remote control that literally alters time for he who operates it. I caught the broadcast premiere, probably in the effort to make this yet another 'holiday' favorite (and which is appropriate, if the 'holiday' meant more than simply - holiday). It's a 'Capra-film' (Frank Coraci, actually), nonetheless, just not quite as good.A struggling junior architect, happily married with two small children, wishes to become partners in a firm designing large projects. He's having trouble with their domestic squabbling, like George in the 'fixer-upper' after having lost the day's cash, and wants time to himself for an important presentation. More importantly, with the various remote controls around the house, he keeps picking up the wrong one. Finally frustrated, he takes off late one evening to pick one up. For some reason, the device mysteriously appears in a Bed, Bath and Beyond store, down the end of a dark hallway and inside a mysteriously gigantic warehouse - the mystical genie or fortune teller at the carnival that later disappears, as it were. Walken is the 'angel', appearing as some 'nutty professor' at first, that delivers this pact, and this device, without ever quite explaining how it works.Our hero, Newman, returns to find it operates his TV, but doesn't notice it also operated his wife. Soon he starts to notice that he can adjust the volume, and the world around him becomes mute. He can pause/stop time with the pause button, and so on. He finds he can skip uncomfortable family meals and outings, or skip to a possible promotion day, by hitting fast forward. And as soon as he discovers this power, even someone unfamiliar with Dickens is going to say - that way lies tragedy. And of course it does.Eventually, he returns to the store, finds the same hallway, and questions the 'angel'. More about the device is explained to him. At this point, he'd rather pass. But now he can't get rid of it. Try as he might to destroy it, it keeps coming back. It does proves its worth, in a way, in overhearing and translating a Japanese contingent complaining about the project he had proposed. He presents their complaints back to them, before they leave, and wins the contract, and is on his way . . eventually . . to partnership and to wealth and power at the head of a large firm before he dies.In the meanwhile, the remote is firing off fast forward even when he doesn't push the button. He lives his life on 'auto-pilot', it's explained in those periods. He can return as an observer to those times he missed, but cannot do them over. Years are lost to him. He wife leaves him. And at the end, he speaks badly to his father over a game of a 'magic coin' that had always been their secret and bond. Dad leaves the room in tears, and dies not long afterward, all of which our hero missed for fast forward.Standing at his father's grave, the 'angel' again shows up and says - I am the angel of death. The device had been the trick of the genie, basically. You asked the devil for a favor, and it wasn't quite the bargain one imagined.Oddly, though, as he dies in the rain, in the street, having run out of his son's wedding to warn him - take time with your family, because his son was up against the clock on yet another project of his own at the same firm - the 'angel of death' for some reason relents and hits the reset button. Our hero awakes in BBnB just before he discovered the hallway that night so long ago. And like Scrooge, like George Bailey, he appreciates what he had that he hadn't before. He gets his second chance. In fact, as a final temptation, the device again appears before him, supernaturally, one last time. He throws it in the trash.It's the same moral or object lesson. We don't really get do-overs, which is probably the source of pathos in these stories. But we can by such stories learn to be thankful and appreciate our loved ones, and even all those around us. In Dickens, the angels or phantoms were doing as told. In Capra, Clarence got his wings. In this one, however, we tend to forget the 'angel'. Seems like he might just have gotten a reprimand.",Null,0,1,28 November 2008
Contact," Preposterous study of faith and despair
","SPOILERS!!Supposedly based on something penned by popularizer and self-promoter, Carl Sagan, this is a movie about a hoax, wrapped in a sci-fi film, and promising a tragedy which is not ultimately explored. A famous billionaire concocts a scheme to fool SETI with a message to which he later conveniently provides the - key. The doubt is left that a recording of an outer space trip, in the blink of an eye, though nothing was recorded but static. This isn't explored and seems to be tossed away by the filmmaker in favor of his irony of science made into religion - as a matter of faith.The means to explore the irony and emptiness is, again, preposterous. A rich billionaire somehow manages to fool ground based observers that a unique message is being sent from a far away star system, travelling from earth 26 years, and sent back at higher amps almost immediately. The transmission parroted back is of Hitler opening the 36 Olympic Games. Included in the Hitler broadcast but on another carrier, which the billionaire decodes for Foster's character, are the blueprints for a gigantic gyroscope looking thing into which a ball, a manned capsule, is simply dropped as the three separate rings of the gyro spin rapidly. Why it doesn't act like a giant baseball bat, I don't know.So the story follows Foster's character from amateur astronomer and something of a techie savant, to the beginning of the SETI hoax, through the discovery of the hidden blueprints, and up to the construction of a public model of this giant gyro courtesy of NASA. She wants to go. But overbearing Skerrit's character gets the nod, instead. He goes before the selection panel and essentially says, I believe in God. And Foster either wasn't sure, or simply didn't.Anyway, a terrorist cult leader, played by Busey (and son looks so much like father) - yeah, this gets better all the time - a terrorist cult leader doesn't want Foster, the unbeliever, to visit the aliens, or something. So he gets it into his head to sabotage the project. Apparently security is so lax, that he manages, James Bond style, to infiltrate the command center of the giant gyro. Foster recognizes him, on closed circuit. And she tries to alert the Skerrit character. Too late. Somehow, Busey sabotaged the rig, and it blows, spewing shards like a helicopter breaking up on hitting the ground, and killing Skerrit and bunches more nearby.But all is not lost. You see, secretly, on Hokkaido, in Japan, a second exact duplicate of the giant gyro was built. And Foster is now top of the list for the Japanese project. So off she goes. Apparently security is a little tighter, this time. She walks bravely out onto the gantry, as if boarding a rocket to the moon, climbs into the ball, and once the firey gyro is spinning crazily, in she goes.And what a trip it is. She sees a galaxy up close. She floats down onto a reverse wave beach, with distortion effects, which allow her to touch said galaxy and cause it to react to her 'giant' touch. She gets to talk with her dead father about the 'human condition'. And plop, her capsule is in the water. It was all just a dream.And the end of the movie puts her on the stand at a Congressional hearing where the Woods character proposes the hoax theory. And she is in the dock saying all she has to go on about her dream being more than a dream is - faith.Ultimately, the point of the film isn't to propose a defense of faithlessness. It's simply to propose that all religions are alike; and only a meanie like Busey would think, otherwise. As such, it misses its own point. If faith is real, it's worth saying it is. If faith is convincing, but false, as with the dream/hallucination of the Foster character, it's better it not be held as faith, but based on only reducible fact. She basically tempts fate, as some would say, by constantly challenging the supposed faith of McConaughey's character of the fornicating priest - who insists he has a faith, of some sort of other, and wonders if she does, as well. But when it turns out that she does, namely this dream of hers, the 'contact' is made as he defends her to the press, after they've about written the whole thing off as the most expensive and elaborate hoax in all of history, as well. She's not alone. And he's not alone. But both of their faiths are baseless. And she has surrendered the touchstone of scientific verification, as well. She's even more pathetic. She just - knows. And he himself never really defended science.Both fail to find real faith, but find each other in their emptiness. A more interesting film, a sequel, would follow up the hoax to see if after finding each other, that they found something true and worth believing, as well. Or does the story end with confusion, despair, and a hole in each of their souls? It would not be a happy ending. But it would seem the logical course for what this film sets up as a classic tragedy.",Null,1,3,31 January 2004
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Great original - bad sequel
","Spoilers!There's always #4 to look forward to. As for this one, Raiders II, it should be - after Indy and Marion found the Ark of the Covenant, with the fire shooting, and the exploding Bellocs, and the tornado of ashes splitting the clouds, and . . .Gee - whatever happened to the Ark? If this is a sequel, and not another 'prequel', what the heck . . happened? That's what's so startling. The answer is - nothing. It's just a new adventure. Even the old serials picked up from the last episode. Indy hasn't been affected. Nothing changed in his character, except that he's now sillier. It makes him seem almost . . insane. Never mind that the writers have taken to denigrating his character with 'we named the dog, Indiana', and whatever else.Apart from that, there are other problems. The music isn't quite as inspiring as with the original. It's just kind of flat. That's hard to explain, since the original film depended so much on the score. Also, there's no follow-on from the previous characters. It's nice that Rhys-Davies and Elliot return, but they now play their characters almost as buffoons - Elliot almost like a small, foolish child (the pen is mightier .. strikingly different that the much more self-possessed and intelligent man in the original film).The quest, of course, isn't really for the Grail, the supernatural superweapon in the wrong hands (not explained why). It's for Dad. But even this is played for yucks. They're in no real sense of danger. The Nazis that imprison them are little more than Keystone Cops. The flaming room never is any real problem, in which the idiot Nazis all seem to get trapped. They should have put big red noses on these guys, and maybe on all the protagonists, as well (Connery is no James Bond, here). It's very different from the much more serious gloss you had in the original, the true sense of adventure - where you had the sense these Nazis were really torturers, were really killers, were really Nazis, and where Indy was perpetually being beaten and dragged and hit and whatever else - in this film, he just kinda skates. In the first film, he was courageous and resourceful. In this one he seems to be reading from a script.The thing with the Grail, too, just doesn't fly. This is supposed to be a magical cup that the Nazis will use for world domination - like the Ark, the monstro laser beam, if you will. That's how it's stated at one point in the film. The Grail can't fall into the Nazi's hands. But when we see it treated basically as little more than a home remedy for gunshot wound, despite all the 'she never really believed in the grail', fact is, nobody in this film really believes in the Grail. This is very different from the first film. It's an afterthought. It's nothing like the Ark - in the myth of these films, anyway. The Grail is sort of like that golden idol in the opening scene of the first Raiders movie. It's not like the Ark.Maybe it's the search for Dad, that throws things off. Try that with the Ark story, and it would have been very different, and prob. not very well remembered. Maybe it's that Connery plays it for laughs, and so does Ford. That's really a darned shame. The first movie had its light moments. But the characters weren't dumbed down to get the laughs. Maybe it's that there aren't really the bad guys, here, but just goofs. Good guys are clowns, bad guys are clowns, and the guardian of the Grail can't even hold onto his sword. Maybe it's because Indy's character hasn't developed or changed, particularly after seeing what he did of the Ark on that island.When they go back to Berlin for the diary, cause Dad can't even remember one of the most important things he wrote (not to mention Indy, who reads the diary on the plane but apparently misses the infamous map - pointed out to him by Brody over a coffee table), they get sort of lost in the crush of adoring fanatics for Der Fuhrer. I think that was sort of the theme of the whole movie - it was just kind of lost in what remained of the Raiders myth, trying to dust the thing off, repair the damage of time, and hope one could go home again to the same kind of movie, finding instead that it's easy to just simply get lost.",Null,0,0,6 August 2000
The Birds," A film that still holds up
","Spoilers!Tippi Hedren is still a star for this film (recent SF film festival promo commerical paid trib. with a Bird's take-off and a Hedren stand in actress). We see 'Hitch's intro to the thing, with the sort of 'environmentalist' apologetic against man's exploitation of anything fowl.Given that, the bird's attack cause . . . they're mad, basically. No more turkey dinners. No more aviaries. No more producing tons of eggs that just go bad anyway on the store shelves, anyway. The bird's are fed up and just aren't gonna take . . . well - 'nother movie.Basically, it's an adaptation of the 50s monster movies. The monster gets loose, authorities are slow to react, to see the larger picture. They run through hoops to explain the evidence. Eventually the army gets called in - save in the other films you saw the jeeps and trucks rolling - here it's just reported on the radio, toward the end.The birds rampage the town, then chill for awhile, then rampage, chill, rampage, and so on. People get cut up, killed, eyes get pecked out, and so on. Pretty bloody for early 60s. There are just some classic scenes, of course, borrowed and parodied so often since. The bird gather on the jungle gym next to the schoolhouse, as Tippi sits there oblivious. Tippi and kids run in panic as the jungle gym birds alight and swoop down on them. Tippi heads for phone booth as the birds attack the town - birds smash into the glass of said booth. And, of course, the final scene where they slowly drive off, to get Tippi some professional (medical) help, amid thousands of birds just quietly milling around outside the battered homestead, getting up the strength to set off again.It's different from the other monster attacks movies in that you don't see the army in control, and the monsters vanquished. It's sort of left up in the air (no pun intended) - the big question mark (literally) at the end of some of those films. Did the army successfully rout the birds? Was it a worldwide conspiracy or phenomenon? Did things get back to normal, or was it the beginning of the end for humanity?Of course, you wonder how the birds could be so intimidating and powerful. Can an angry seagull, even a bunch of them, really do battle with someone holding so much as a baseball bat? I don't know. Blackbirds, ravens - maybe. They seem big with their wings spread. But tons of sparrows? That has to have been a little bit of a joke.Anyhow.",Null,1,2,12 October 1999
Jurassic Park," Classic Sci-Fi film!
","SPOILERS!Like Topgun was a movie about jet fighters, with a plot casually tossed in, this is a movie about CGI and robotic dinosaur parts, with a heist film stitched to a chase casually tossed in.It's a good movie. In fact, it's a classic sci-fi film. It's the classic big budget summer movie from Hollywood. It's the 50s monster movie that looks all the more convincing for better effects. The 'serious' overlay is no different than that of Them or The Thing, as the scientists or survivors discuss the 'bigger picture'. There's just a little too much, with not enough humor, of that, in this. Dern and Grandpa shout over the dinette table, but carry on too long, and cry about it all. Goldblum pounds the conference table in a 50s-looking soundstage with lots of projector screens oddly surrounding it. Serious issue, man made the atom bomb, or man created dinosaurs from the DNA of bullfrogs. Issue made. Now let Mothra rage - or whatever is let loose.The special effects are an improvement over the pure model and stop motion of the past. Harryhausen's work is still watchable, and believable (his crab in Mysterious Island). But here, for the first time, you see dinosaurs done right. Maybe the full size models of T-Rex bobbing and weaving around the jeep, and poking its head into the glass, is a little stiff, and Harryhausen did better, or would have. But splice in the CGI T-Rex ripping off the tires, or chasing Goldblum, and its entirely different, and very believable. A shame they wind up with a smaller Rex in the indoor lobby. The Rex on the grassy field was more in keeping to scale with the one that injured Goldblum - and killed the annoying lawyer.Won't mention all the plot holes and continuity errors, even just in that one scene in the jeep fleeing the T-Rex at night. And the kids and the electrified fence. Kids go through the holes - oh, wait - big noise in background, up you go, hurry! That bothered me even when I first saw it in the theatre. Dern and Neil holding the raptor at bay outside the control room - TIMMY! get the darned gun. The kid's just pounding the back of Lex's chair as she says - this is UNIX system. And then the gun jams when the raptor does break the glass. How convenient. Game hunter in the woods - run Laura, run, no, you can't, they're watching us, run, run now, wait, you'll never make it, go, GO! (reminded me, vaguely, of the Kirk/Spock comedy routine with Mrs. Camden in movie 4) But it's just a movie. It could have been much better. I don't remember those kind of holes in something like Them or even Mysterious Island (which really was a hodge-podge).But it's a good film, still. The cliches and cliched camera movements work. The CGI were excellent, if inconsistent. It still holds up in 2002. If The Thing, by Hawkes, is a classic film, and with a far better script and dialog than JP, and obviously less graphic where the horror and gore are only related second person, then even so JP is still, without question, a classic along the same lines as those old sci-fi films.",Null,2,3,1 August 2002
