Minority Report," Spielberg and Cruise, a true masterpiece.
","There are some movies in this world that can only be done by certain people, and this was one of them.  This was a masterpiece by both Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise.  The perfection and precision that is trademark of Spielberg is laced throughout the piece while Tom Cruise delivers his usual intensity and action.",10,0,0,26 July 2002
Pan's Labyrinth," An amazing movie
","Guillermo Del Toro has created several beautiful and striking movies before, but this tops those by far. In many ways, it's a darker version of a fairy tale, similer to 'Alice in Wonderland', combining many aspects of different fairy tales, but Del Toro paints a remarkable picture through this movie. The character designs seem to be something out of a sketchbook illustration, yet somehow, they work visually in this real and dangerous world that the characters live in. If possible, watch this movie with it's companion piece, 'The Devil's Backbone', which in many ways share's this movies tone.Highly recommended, seek it out, and enjoy this movie.",10,2,4,8 January 2007
