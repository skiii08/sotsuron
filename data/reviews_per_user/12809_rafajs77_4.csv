The Ring," Great!
","This movie makes you realize why so many other movies fail to be scary...not enough psychological elements. What this movie does right is that it skips the gore, and blood, and over-the-top overacting crazed lunatics that seem the norm in horror movies.I saw this with a friend in the theater and 10 minutes in we were sinking into our chairs with fear. Not even the annoying teens making their phones ring to scare their friends (when you see the movie you will understand why) were a powerful enough distraction to undo the terror we felt.Definitely see it, make sure you have as big a TV as you can get your hands on when you rent it, and that you watch it at night in the dark...if you want the full effect. Also, make sure you rent it on DVD and NOT cassette...you know, just to be safe ;)",10,200,240,17 August 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Overrated
","This movie was good, but I don't know that it deserved the slew of Oscar nominations it received. It certainly wasn't good because of Brad Pitt, he has one of the least expressive faces in show business and it is difficult to actually believe he is feeling any of the emotions the script calls for. Another liability of this film is its length, most of which is spent showing the title character bouncing around apparently trying to find himself, which makes sense, given his circumstances, but it is a very superficial treatment. Finally, his aging process is not actually linear (neither forwards nor backwards), so an already implausible premise becomes even more difficult to buy into. I'm glad I saw it, but it is not the spectacular film people would have you believe.",6,11,21,23 January 2009
The Dark Knight," Rides the edge, but doesn't fall off...
","I, like many fans of superhero movies had grown to detest what had happened to the Batman series of films. The first one with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson is a classic...but the missteps began with the second one. There was no need to have two villains in one movie, both Danny Devito and Michelle Pfeiffer could have carried an entire film by themselves. Then of course came the almost cartoonish and ridiculous follow ups complete with one-liners from Arnold.But I digress, 'Batman Begins,' was astounding...no doubt. I was very excited about 'The Dark Knight' and finally went to see it.This one was lighter on character development than the first one, which was a shame. Heath Ledger, however, saves the the day with his rendition of the Joker. Just based on his performance, I didn't mind that little was offered about his background.I thought that Aaron Eckhart was being set up for a role as Two Face for film 3 (which would have been astounding), instead, they created him and killed him off in half a movie. So for awhile there are two villains at once and it brought back images of the last series. If anyone should have been killed off, it should have been the Joker...so that no one could spoil Ledger's rendition in a follow up, oh well, I'm not the director.I respect Christian Bale, but somehow in this one some of his trademark additions to the character were a bit exaggerated...his deep raspy voice screaming in the face of evil-doers 'where is she?' 'where is he?' etc. became a bit grating after 5 or 6 iterations.Equally, this one had many more explosions, outrageous chase sequences and other elements that were absent, for the most part, from the first...it really rode the edge, but like I said, it didn't fall off and become ridiculous.One good example of the better reflection of reality in this series is that the girl dies. Batman is placed in the awkward situation of choosing to save one life versus another and instead of MAGICALLY saving both, one person dies and it is the one we least expected...well done! Thus overall I was satisfied and I highly recommend seeing it, but if 'Batman Begins' was a 10, 'The Dark Knight' is an 8 or 8.5.",8,0,8,11 August 2008
Bring It On," What most people don't understand
","I tend to eschew frivolous films, and because of this I have had to defend my appreciation of this movie. People find confusing that the movie shows both self-absorbed cheerleaders who believe the endeavor to be worthwhile and meaningful, and at the same time cheerleading's detractors. Also confusing is how a cheerleading squad could function without a faculty coach. The reason this is peripheral to the film is that the film is about fair play and sportsmanship, and it succeeds in conveying that message.The dialogue is funny and approaches wit several times. My favorite line in the movie is delivered by Courtney (Clare Kramer): 'I don't mean to be predictable, but I don't give a sh!%!' Perfect! The acting is pretty solid, what seems like overacting to some is simply part of the satire that the movie is. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",10,3,3,3 June 2006
