First Man," One Giant Leap
",Being a child of the 60s I loved this movie. But it was so much more. The performances by Clare Foy and Ryan Gosling were brilliant. The restrained calm of Neil Armstrong speaks to a different generation and to the mans training. Gosling brought Armstrongs character to life in a way that has you gasping for air. And Clare Foys portrayal of Armstrong's wife as a direct clear mind individual shows where the strength in their family lay. While we all know the story the final scene in this movie is a massive relief valve ...restrained but so impactful I was moved deeply. This should be an Academy award winner.,9,1,3,25 November 2018
Captain Marvel," One of the Best MCU films
",This movie had it all. Great plot twists. Great new characters were introduced. Goose the catðŸ¤£. More backstory on Fury. Plus fantastic affirming messages for diversity. Brie Larson was a fantastic- a cross between Tony Stark in terms of wit and Captain America for pathos. I think we see a new leader for the next 10 yrs.,10,2,5,9 March 2019
