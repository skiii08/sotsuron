The Blair Witch Project," why it's scary
","I think TBWP is so popular because everyone has their own different ideas about what's scary; this movie leaves so much to the imagination that the viewer has to fill in the blanks... and where do people find the scariest things but in their own imaginations..... Great, great movie... on my all-time list of favorites, and probably always will be.",10,1,2,7 August 1999
