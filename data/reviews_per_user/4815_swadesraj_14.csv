Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Over 1 bln dollars in sales...
","Hard to believe this episode of the series made so much. The plot wasn't particularly exciting. The series has become heavily monopolised and not at all what George Lucas' vision of Star Wars once was. Such a shame. In saying that, the special effects and every other element of an ideal film were there.",6,1,3,15 March 2019

Green Book," Enjoyable
",While the decision for best film is contentious - I still enjoyed this film with a message about treatment of another race. It's a comedic and sad reminder of how we shouldn't be in the modern era. Well acted and directed.,8,1,3,18 March 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," No story but great film
