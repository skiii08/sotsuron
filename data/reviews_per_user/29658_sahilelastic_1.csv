War Dogs," An entertaining look at some infamous real-world events
","War Dogs is a comedy drama film directed by Todd Phillips which follows two arms dealers, Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, who receive a US Army contract to supply munitions for the Afghan National Army.This is by no means a memorable film but it serves as platform for two good performances by Miles Teller and Jonah Hill especially the latter who delivers some of the best comic moments of the film.He is almost unrecognizable as Diveroli and Teller and Hill play well off of each other.However the supporting characters come out as rather flat and boring.Todd Phillips is best known for making raunchy comedies like The Hangover or Road Trip but this is his first film that feels more grown up and meaningful.He does a fairly good job here and the cinematography by Lawrence Sher borderlines between flat and breathtaking.There is even a cameo from a particular A-list actor that was enjoyable to see. War Dogs doesn't truly deliver but it is watchable and entertaining enough to keep viewers interested.",7,0,0,4 January 2017
