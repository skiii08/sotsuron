Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not bad, but not great
","By reading the title, you can basically guess the nature of my comments. Though it is not without it's flaws Episode I is not a horrible film. It's just not a wonderful one either. I consider it to be decent. It had many plot flaws, what some people don't understand is that, Episode I is an introduction to the charecters we will come to know in the prequel trilogy. It was the same way when A New Hope was released. This came to me when I was a bit disapointed when I returned from the theater three years ago on the day of it's release. I popped in the original and watched, and came to this conclusion The charecters in A New Hope were somewhat under developed and there were many plot holes there too. In fact you should watch A New Hope After watching Episode I and you may see my point.Anyway, Episode I though it had it's flaws which did take up more of the movie than I cared for, also had it's upsides. One really neat upside was the podracing sequence, the gungan battle, the way that politics work in the galactic senate when it existed, Obi Wan Kenobi as a young padawan, the friendship between the Obi Wan and Qui Gon, Ewan Mcgregor as Obi Wan and as you can all guess the action scenes. These were all good components in the film and saved it from being a total loss. The things that without the components mentioned above could have killed it all together, are as followed. The complaint department consists of, Jar Jar Binks for obvious reasons, the whole idea of midichlorians, Anakin Skywalker being introduced as a 9 year old with all those abilities, and the space battle, which was the worst I'd ever seen. Now I love Star Wars outer space battles but this one was just lame because we never saw a Naboo fighter pilot shoot down one single federation fighter, and all we really saw was Naboo pilots flying like chickens with their heads cut off.Anyway, as stated many times above, though the film has its flaws, the good in it does out do the bad parts. So, Episode I should be seen as what it is, foreshadowing of things to come. And by the way, Episode II is an improvement.",Null,0,1,21 May 2002
We Were Soldiers," Gripping and Gut wrenching
","We were soldiers has got to be one of the best war films, I have ever seen. Though it is extremely full of cliche's it still gets a powerful lesson in history across. The Ia Drang valley battle was one of the worst that the US has ever been involved. I'm very surprised that anyone survived it, even with an outstanding officer like Hal Moore (gibson). The film also portrayed the Viet Namese in a better light than in most other films about that war. Like I said the only problem I could find with this film is the many cliche's that appeared in it. The one that showed up in the film and has been absolutely done to death is the dying soldier lying on the field saying in a raspy voice: 'Tell my wife, I love her' Actually the most common thing a dying soldier says is 'Tell my mother I love her'. Anyway as many cliche's as there are in the film, they don't even come close to taking away the power that this film had on many others in the audiences. I've seen some great films on Viet Nam but this one has ranks right under Platoon. Platoon shows the sphycological hell that American soldiers in Viet Nam went through in that time period and We Were Soldiers shows the courage that fighting men showed throughout the war. There is one thing that about We Were Soldiers that for me sets it apart from other films about Viet Nam. We Were Soldiers shows that soldiers returning from Viet Nam were given no parade or friendly welcome of any kind like the ones who returned from World Wars I and II. Infact, people who passed them in the streets ignored them entirely most of the time. Now we get to the performances. I personally was impressed by all who acted in this film. Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot, and Greg Kinnear all gave memorable performances. However, one actor who really outdid himself was Chris Klein. I've never much liked Chris Klein because I've always felt that he is just a 23 year old playing a teenager. This film he has really shown himself as a serious actor. Anyway great movie,",9,1,2,20 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Got my money's worth
","Let me just say that I had my doubts about this movie after the experience I had with Episode I, but the second Episode II started, all of them were put to rest. I was on the edge of my seat from the moment of the very first explosion. (hope that wasn't a spoiler) Now let me clarify that Episode I was not a horrible movie at all, it just was a bit childish. Jar Jar Binks, dragged the ATOC's predecessor down that far. One improvement in Attack of The Clones is that Jar Jar has roughly five minutes in the whole movie which is a great improvement. Almost all of the great minor charecters from Episode one are back, such as Watto, the trade federation viceroy and his friend, and who could ever forget, the battle droids.Now we come to Episode II's flaws. Though there are very few in the film they need to be addressed. The music in the climactic battle at the end. 'SPOILER ALERT' The battle between the droid army and the republic's clone army was a victory in that respect. However the music suggests otherwise, it felt like Schindlers list in a way. Secondly, none of the clone troopers were actual people in costume like the stormtroopers were. Even in close up shots you could tell that they were placed there with a computer. It took away from the credibility of the close up battle scenes. One more flaw is how during the battle the clone army's gunships beared an uncanny resemblance to the Huey choppers that were used in Viet Nam and other American wars. For a few breif moments I thought I was watching a futuristic version of 'We Were Soldiers'. (also a good movie)That's it for the complaint department, now the best parts of the film. Star Wars Episode II: Attack of The Clones, though not without its flaws, has got to be one of the best films in the entire series. Infact not only does it make up for the somewhat disapointing TPM, but it also makes TPM make more sense and also more enjoyable. It fills in some of the holes that were left by Phantom Menace. It has taken a sort of Empire Strikes Back nature, in that it is darker and the audience seems to learn more about the charecters and situation involving the galaxy which is far from over. Anakin and Padme's romance blossoms throughout the movie as it did between Han and Leia in 'Empire', and like 'Empire, the romance did not interfere with anything. And finnally, I don't want to give anything away, but you will never look at Yoda the same way ever again.All in all I give Episode II: Attack of the Clones, ***1/2. I had to take some points off for the complaints that were stated in the second paragraph. Anyway go see it, you won't be disapointed.",Null,0,0,16 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Keep up the good work, George!
","I saw the midnight showing of Star Wars Episode II Attack of The Clones on May 16th which was the morning I turned 19, and I have to say, I had some major doubts about this one. I had seen Phantom Menace, a few years before and was disappointed by it. However, the second that the recent addition to the Star Wars Saga began, all doubts were practically non-existant. Star Wars Episode II Attack of The Clones, though it had some minor flaws, was an excellent film as far as Star Wars movies go. It was a gigantic improvement over The Phantom Menace, which was not horrible, just not wonderful either. (too aimed towards small children) ATOC has a good solid plot, great action, a considerably lesser amount of Jar Jar, and also better charecter development than its predecessor, The Phantom Menace. These when put together make Attack of the Clones a milestone in both of the Star Wars trilogies. Not only is it better than TPM, it also makes the moments in that film that did not make sense, have a bit of meaning to them.The movie has an Empire Strikes Back feel to it which works on so many levels. It fits in with Phantom Menace and and has a darker nature to it, just as Empire did. In fact we begin to see Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side. I cannot reveal to you how, but it is becoming quite evident. Also the romance factor, blossoming between Anakin and Padme, though contains a few lines that will make you cringe, does not really interfere with the movie at all. Infact, is nothing like the love story subplot in Pearl Harbor, which did nothing but interfere. Another element which makes Episode II worth watching is the climactic battle at the end which involves Yoda fighting which makes the Matrix look like child's play. There are many other great elements but I cannot name them all because there were too many to remember off hand. But just go see it and you will see what I mean.'WARNING, POSSIBLE SPOILERS' Now as I said above, though the movie was excellent, it did have a few minor flaws. One was the scene when Obi Wan Kenobi, steps into a 50's style diner, and asks the local chef about a weapon he found. The problem with that is that it had a creepy sort of Arnold's Diner from Happy Days vibe to it. Second, the title, of the film which does not really fit with how the film plays out. It says 'Attack of the Clones' as if the clones were the bad guys. The clones turn out to be the heroes of the republic and also where storm troopers originated from. The last thing I will waste space complaining about will be the gunships the clones were using. They were in a way sleek and made for some good action but they bore an all too eerie resemblance to the Huey helicopters used in Viet Nam. I suddenly got the feeling I was watching a futuristic version of We Were Soldiers. (also an excellent movie)All in all, Attack of the Clones was a great film and will most likely be the Empire Strikes Back of the Prequel trilogy. As stated in the first paragraph, it has all the elements that a Star Wars movie needs, with some very minor flaws which every Star Wars film has. Oh and I should mention that Ewan McGregor just has made the best young Alec Guiness that George Lucas could ever find. George Lucas gave me one of the best birthday presents I could ever recieve, and it was worth waking up cranky the morning of my birthday. Keep it up George, you have one more chapter to go and I have faith that it will be one of the best ever.",Null,0,0,23 May 2002
The Patriot," imbellished but otherwise a great film
","The Patriot is one of the best war movies ever made. The entire cast knew exactly what they were doing when they filmed this masterpeice of a film. It has all that people go to this genre for. The Patriot has just about everything, such as realistic combat scenes from that time period and charecters who reflect exactly the way people thought at the time. The way they captured the friction between patriots and loyalists was great and it was the only thing they could have done more with, however what they did depict was almost enough. As I said above, the battle sequence were some of the best I have ever seen filmed, next to Saving Private Ryan.(also a good movie)Now thought there were many imbellishments in the main context of the film itself, one common complaint I heard about The Patriot was about it's over the top villain, Colenol William Tavington. What very few people know is that the charecter, Tavington was loosely based on a real person named Tartelton, who would order the shooting of anyone from Colonial Officers, surrendering troops, and even innocent civillians. Although, he never actually to my knolledge burned churches. The same goes for Mel Gibson's charecter, Ben Martin. Ben Martin was based on Mariam Fox who lead militia forces against the British to the point where they actually did give him a nickname (Swamp Fox) and put a price on his head. So though they used different names for both charecters and imbellished their deeds a bit, these were still real people.In retrospect, is The Patriot the best war movie ever made? No, not by far. There are some scenes in there that will make you think you're watching a soap opera. Besides which the film makers could have done a much better job of portraying slavery in a more realistic sense, and not as sugar coated. However put all the flaws in this movie aside and you'll see what a good film overall that it really is. Here's some sound advice: Wait for the fourth of July and after you're done watching the fireworks and having a BBQ, sit down and watch The Patriot. It is a movie that boldly asks: What would you sacrifice to be free.",Null,0,1,16 April 2002
