It," Don't think IT should have been done - but IT's enjoyable
","How do you adapt a hefty 1000-page Stephen King epic for the big screen? Preferably, you don't. But if you necessarily have to, I suppose this is about as good as IT gets - and don't get me wrong, IT's still pretty darn good. IT's just nowhere near as brilliant as the novel, and that spoils quite a bit of the fun. At least for me.Still, all said and done IT's a good film. The kids are all fairly descent actors, and Sophia Lillis is even really good. The actors to really outperform themselves are the adult creep-bags, though. Skarsg√•rd is great as IT, and Stuart Hughes is equally great as Bowers senior. Shining brightest of them all, however, is Stephen Bogaert as Bev's insanely creepy dad. The all too few scenes featuring him are doubtlessly the movie's scariest and greatest moments. There should be a movie about him!Anyhow, the story takes off quickly, and is driven forward at a great pace. Sometimes a tad too great, as we find ourselves thrown from one creepy clown-encounter to the next with barely any time to settle down and get to know the kids. That's sad, since it takes about two thirds of the film to get to know them, and it's not until then you really start caring for them.All said and done, IT is a solid, non-scary but highly dramatic horror film. Enjoyable but not particularly memorable.With that said, for those of you who've not read the book: Read IT!! Learn the origin of IT, and how much more IT is than just a creepy clown.",5,3,7,14 September 2017
The Irishman," A heartwrenching masterpiece
","Just seeing DeNiro and Pacino joining forces on the silver screen again is enough to bring on the chills. And then there's Scorsese. And Pesci. Almost as if the stars have aligned to create the perfect trip down memory lane. A, possibly last, chance to see the giants of old act their hearts out against one another.And truth be told, I didn't expect much more of this film. Some great nostalgia. Possibly a punch to the gut as I realize how time flies. And that would have been fine with me. I would still have paid to see it.But it's clear as day that's not enough for them. Because this isn't just nostalgic nod to the past, but a masterpiece in its own right.The film centers around DeNiro's character Frank, an old mob hitman telling us about his past. Of how he got to work for the Russell Bufaino (Pesci). Of his friendship and ultimate betrayal of Jimmy Hoffa (superbly portraited by Pacino). And of his regrets in regards of to how his children came to view him and his crimes.The three-and-a-half hour of runtime may scare some, but to me it was worth every second of it. The main trio of actors are excellent. As is the rest of the cast. And the camerawork. And most everything else; the suspense is high, dialogue is sharp and progress steady. But most of all I'm awed by the underlining sense of dread. The almost tangible fear of ending up old and alone.",10,5,15,28 November 2019
Bird Box," High quality drama in a beautiful apocalypse
","Rarely do drama and horror blend as beautifully as in the apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic genre, and Bird Box is a perfect example of that. Since the movie focuses more on the emotions and relations among the group of survivors (of a never fully explained apocalyptic event) most charactes become relatable and appreciated - even the morally complex ones. Because of these relations set up between the charactes we as viewers also feel their pain and sorror when something happens to one of them.Sandra Bullock is great as the pregnant woman caught in the middle of this strange maelstorm, and John Malkovic is amazing playing an enigmatic (and sometimes infuriating) cynic. The rest of the cast does well too. The two child actors are superb too. Great choice!",8,5,14,23 December 2018
Captain America: Civil War," A great movie, which annoyed the hell out of me
","Many may consider this the best Marvel movie to date, and I can see why. It does a good job of adding an additional layer of depth to the current avengers, as well as introducing a few new ones. It also does a good job of capturing some of the political mess which a group such as the Avengers might cause.Still, I can't help finding myself annoyed with how some of the main characters are portrayed. Tony Stark, who I would label as a narcissistic anti-authoritarian, is suddenly portrayed as quite easily collared. Still slightly narcissistic, but still, it doesn't fit him. Sure, this is a Captian America flick - not 'The Glorious return of the Wonderous Tony Stark', so a few oddities about the other Avengers are to be expected. But still. These oddities are enough to have me annoyed through what could and should have been an amazing film.And, come on, Tony Stark is way cooler than Captain America. They should have made it about him. Really.",6,3,8,3 September 2016
Prometheus," Stupid, unrelatable and pretentious.
","It's taken me five years to write this review, and that's because I don't want to rant. It's difficult though, because whenever I think of Prometheus it's all I can do. My bile-barfing just won't stop when it comes to this movie. But I'll give it my best shot.First off, I've got to say that this movie could have been good, perhaps even great, with but a few minor adjustments here and there. But no, as is, there's no way for this film to outrun it's flaws for as much as a second. They're always present, through every scene with every character from start to finish. So, what is this flaw, which ruins everything for me? I'd narrow it down to two words: Relatability and Believability. This film is neither, and that's not because it's a film about aliens. The other movies in the Alien franchise are all pretty relatable, and pretty believable. They contain a sense of logic, both in their portrayal of the alien species and in their portrayal of the min characters. Prometheus, however, fails miserably on both accounts.I'll try not to spoil anything for anyone who's not watched this film yet (oh, by the way, don't!), but a few examples of this inconsistency and unrelatability has to be put on the table. First off: The mission to find the source of life on earth, which takes the Prometheus expedition deep into space, is funded by a billionaire. It's repeatedly stated how much this man has spent on this journey, and still everyone from crew members to scientists appear to be the very worst and most incompetent in their field. That's just stupid. A redneck crew makes sense in Alien, where they're just flying a cargo ship, but not in Prometheus. Another insanely stupid thing about this movie is how all characters, consequently, disregard all safety protocols and common sense. Aggressive aliens snakes? Let's undress and take a selfie! An unknown atmosphere? Let's all take off our helmets. Utterly, fatally unbelievable. And then there's this new twist to the Alien life cycle. I'll try not to spoil anything, but I have a hard time figuring out how such a species ever could have evolved, since it appears to require both fungi spores and infertile human wombs to even be born.There's more. The list goes forever on, but I won't let this review will turn into another rant. I've already written a few such on the topic of Prometheus on my blog, so go there if you want to read one. Instead I'll leave you with one final advise regarding this film:Don't. Watch. It. EVER.",1,5,7,15 September 2017
