The Ring," Intensity that maintains
","A gift to the thriller industry, though it is considered a horror, 'the Ring' is an original story (after 'Ringu') with an original score. If you like haunting cinematography, not overdone to become clich√©, and a sinister plot that unravels in your mind as you see through Rachel's (Naomi Watts) eyes, definitely check this out. I cannot say enough how the tenseness takes over as the music and the motives combine. I went to high school in Washington state and the ferry rides were never like this. As clues are gathered by Rachel (the investigator for reasons displayed early in the movie) the audience is captured between a whodunit or whatdunit type of anticipation, that is determined to find something really bad at the end of the line.",9,0,1,17 June 2005
