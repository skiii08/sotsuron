Requiem for a Dream," Masterpiece
","This film came as no surprise to me that it was as brilliant as it was. Having seen Darren Aronofsky's Pi I could not see how this could not be equally amazing. The film is truly shocking and really gives a horrifying look at drug abuse. The performances were spectacular but in particular from Ellen Burnstyn. Darren Aronofsky's direction is nothing short of brilliant and it is a shame that a film as good as this doesn't receive more recognition from the acadamy when you have the likes of Gladiator scooping awards (which is undeniably a great film), this for me was a better picture. And I cannot stress enough how good the performances were. Ellen Burnstyn should have won an oscar. A must see movie. An all time classic. And no surprise that it is currently ranked number 51 in the imdb all time top 250.",10,0,0,9 August 2001
Billy Elliot," Brilly Elliot
","I rented this movie from my local video shop yesterday after hearing only good things about it. My brother told me that it would be rubbish but I convinced him to watch it anyway. When the credits rolled at the end we both knew that we had just witnessed a great movie. Brilliant is how to sum it up in one word. This film is a real credit to the British film industry and makes me proud to be British. Funny in areas and also very tragic in the circumstances of the family of Billy Elliot. The performances are great throughout and the soundtrack is also excellent (always a bonus in a movie). One thing I don't understand is why so many people commented on the bad language in the movie, I personally thought that it was damn funny and reflected the way that people talk in Britain.",9,0,0,4 April 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Poetry in Motion
","When Crouching Tiger was released a few months ago I was eager to see what it was like. However, living in a small town it has taken from the release date until 17th Feb for me to finally see it. It was worth the wait. Crouching Tiger is one of the most spectacular films that I have ever seen. When you first see the fight scenes take place your initial reaction is that it is ridiculous. No way can people do that. But then all of a sudden you suddenly forget about reality and start thinking fantasy. It is then that the fight scenes become almost like poetry in motion. They are beautiful. The fighters are so graceful and elegant it is almost like they are dancing with one another, yet at the same time as being so delicate there is a huge sense of power and ferocity in the fights aswell. The acting is nothing short of brilliant and Ang Lee's direction should reap what it sews by receiving a heap of awards. The set pieces are fantastic and the backgrounds and scenery are some of the most beautiful areas that I have ever seen. Unfortunately the film has to end and it is at this point that you realise that you are back in England. Returned from your fantasy voyage. Back to the mundane life that so many of us live. Still for two hours I was in a place that I could have stayed forever. A perfect 10.",10,0,0,19 February 2001

Crouching Tiger is one of the most spectacular films that I have ever
seen.

suddenly forget about reality and start thinking fantasy. It is then that

The fighters are so graceful and elegant it is almost like they are
dancing
with one another, yet at the same time as being so delicate there is a

sense of power and ferocity in the fights aswell. The acting is nothing
short of brilliant and Ang Lee's direction should reap what it sews by

Unfortunately the film has to end and it is at this point that you realise

that I could have stayed forever. A perfect 10. ",10,0,0,19 February 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," idiots
","people who think this film is rubbish are idiots. One imdb user, stevesawyer or sommat doesn't seem to realise that this film is a fantasy film and the use of the 'flying people' isn't because people can ACTUALLY do that, because as we all know we can't, it's just part of the fairytale. I suppose you're one of these people who watches star wars and says, oh yeah like there is really an evil overlord!!! Or the sort of person who watches Toy Story and says oh yeah like toys are really alive!!!!! IDIOT!!!!",10,0,0,31 August 2001
Moulin Rouge!," The musicals aren't dead.
","I went to see this film a few weeks back and again last night. The first time i went to see it I went feeling that it was gonna suck. I mean a film with ewan mcgreggor and nicole kidman?? Both of whom have had pretty poor results of late in my opinion. After the first 30 minutes though I have to admit I was taken by surprise. And was really looking forwards to the rest of the movie.It didnt fail to live up to the opening. The acting was great, the singing better, and Baz Lurhman's unique filmic visions have once again triumphed here. Whoever said the musicals were dead?? Well whoever it was I just have 2 amazing things to say to them: Dancer in the Dark and Moulin Rouge!!!!",9,0,0,30 September 2001
Bring It On," Pretty girls in an ugly film
",Yeah well what exactly is suppose to be brought by this film? It's terrible. Just another predictable plot and bad story. I mean don't get me wrong some films that are as cliched as this is are enjoyable but this unfortunately doesn't exactly work. This is merely pretty girls in an ugly film.,3,2,4,26 April 2001
