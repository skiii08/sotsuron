The Blair Witch Project," yeah I'd love to be i the woods with these guys !!!NOT!!!
",These film makers are so annoying they get upset at the littlest things. Yes its clever and spooky but every time something happens their all like OH GOD OH NO WHATS HAPPENING! Some rocks are moved or their's sticks that look like shapes and it has to be the witch not some pranksters or someone in the group. I Did like how the movie was like a real investigation of a legend like Bigfoot the Bell witch or a Chupacabra they interviewed locals some didn't believe It some where sure it existed some thought it was based on a true event but there was no witch. I give it A 6 out of 10 It was intelligent unlike the film crew I just don't know why they thought they where trapped when some step rocks where taken out of the shallow river.,6,0,2,12 November 2007
