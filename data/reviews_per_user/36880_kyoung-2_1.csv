The Blair Witch Project," Laughable
","I thought the trailer combined with the web site was scarier than the movie itself.  I was into it, except for the constant swearing, until they made it into the woods.At that point they lost me.  I was amazed that they could be that terrified and still have the awareness to keep the camera rolling and pointed in the right direction.  Let's face it running through the woods in the middle of the night is tough enough, but to hold a video camera up to head level and try to do it would be crazy.If they had wanted to have done this right (not that it really would have helped.  I don't think anything could have done that), they should have combined the movie and tv special.  Put clips from the TV at the beginning of the movie so you get a sense of what was going on, what happened, and who the blair witch was.  Then go into the 'recovered' film.  But I guess you don't make enough money like that.If nothing else this movie is a triumph for mass marketing and hype.",3,0,1,8 November 1999
