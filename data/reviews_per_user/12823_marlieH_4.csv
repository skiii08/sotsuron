Hereditary," It was good, i get it was overhyped but its still a good movie
","When i watch films at night, in the dark, on my own, i find them alot scarier than watching them in the day or with other people. so perhaps i found this really scary and good because of that reason, but i genuinly think it was a really good movie and im a horror fanatic. it was unpredictable, and scary (and i dont get scared) and it was all in all a good film. the onlt thing is, i didnt really get the ending",8,0,1,17 June 2020
The Descent," One of my Favourite movies
","Its just a really great horror movie that plays so well in that sense of claustophobia, especially if you havent read about the movie before watching it. Shauna Macdonald is such an underrated actress and should be better known as she is brilliant. met her at london comic con one year and she was such a nice person, told me loads about the set design and effects behing the descent.",10,1,2,17 April 2019
A Nightmare on Elm Street," 1 2 freddys litterally been stalking me since ive watched this...
","Honestly one of favourite horror movies ever i love it so much. Watched it for the first time a couple years back cause i wasnt alive when this first came out, and since then have watched the rest of the series. Love it",10,2,2,19 March 2019
True Romance," This movie is a work of art!
","Because I'm not sure why I love this movie so much. I think the main reason is because of the sweet innocence of their romance amongst everything else that's going on. Their loyalty towards one another really drives the film forward and makes the audiences love towards the characters a lot stronger. You get to know the characters as well as they know each other because of their short time together, which makes you cheer on their romance even more. However, that's just a small part of the movie (I'm not a huge fan of pure romance movies). From beginning to end, the movie grips you and takes you on a rollercoaster of different emotions; as you smile at how cute Alabama is and laugh whenever she laughs, and fill with anger when she is being thrown around the hotel room, beaming at her persistence to succeed. Or when you cling onto everything Clarence says, hoping that he comes out the other side alive even though you watched the movie a million times before. This movie is a new experience every time you watch it and overall, this movie just makes me really happy and that is probably the main reason why I love it so much.
It's not just the two main cast members that make this movie. The smaller parts bring just as much importance into the film. Brad Pitt's small role as pothead, Floyd, brings a comedic break into the movie. As well as Gary Oldman and Christopher Walken's roles as the fictitious villains, Drexel and Vincenzo, giving the lead characters something to fear and adding more excitement to the script. And let's not forget that famous fight scene between Alabama and Virgil. I love that scene!
Originally written by Quentin Tarantino, Tony Scott read his script and wanted to direct it. This being one of Tarantino's first movies, Scott approached him and that he could make him huge, if he let him direct this movie. He agreed. Tarantino said Scott 'glossed up my script, made it too pretty, too vivid. That's what makes it work so well, and the casting and performances he got.' It is unclear whether Tarantino loved what he did with the movie, but I think that whatever he changed from the original script, worked!
Linking to the poster. I think it stays very true to the movie itself. It doesn't give much away and merely shows the two main characters with Clarence holding a gun. However, just by looking at the poster it shows straight away how much Alabama means to Clarence at his persistence to keep her safe. And I think Alabama's smile in the first poster against Clarence's serious expression shows the whole reason why this movie is a masterpiece.",10,1,1,5 April 2020
