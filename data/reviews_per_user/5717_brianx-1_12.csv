The Avengers," Avengers meet Avatar
","I was really looking forward to the Avengers and, I have to say I was disappointed. Lousy acting (Samuel L. Jackson (who's usually reliable was wooden and had no real take on the character), Robert Downey, (good thing he wore waterproof mascara for his close-ups) Scarlett Johanssson, who needs to go back to acting school, Mark Ruffalo, (what was his take on the part? he just looked confused and lacked confidence), dead spots that almost put me sleep, some very cheesy F/X using miniatures, particularly noticeable in 3D. Lousy photography...the 3D glasses made everything seem dark and drab, I found myself taking them off and seeing much brighter scenes. I'm sure if you're a 12 year old (sadly I'm not) this movie is the best thing you've ever seen, but there are so many other movies of this genre that are so much better on every level (X- Men, and the Batman series in the capable hands of Christopher Nolan to mention two). Captain America's padding in his shirts was laughable (did they run out of CG's, because he looked much better in his own movie). I'm comparing this movie to Avatar because I was also disappointed with that one too, as it relied totally on on special effects, weak story- line, to make it's success. Oh well, I'll look forward to 'The Dark Knight Rises' because I know Christopher Nolan will not let me down.",4,6,20,10 May 2012
Men in Black 3," MIB3 - Hollow, without a soul
","Rip Torn (Zed), where are you when we need you? This formulaic, copy-cat, clichéd excuse for a sequel disappointed me greatly. Tired story...one villain, a few aliens 'thrown-in', Will Smith trying his best to work with a crummy script, Tommy Lee looking bored with the whole, tired mess, and Josh Brolin, whose Tommy Lee shtick grows tiresome, and the always dependable Emma Thompson totally out of her element (with a laughable hair-do) and absolutely no match for Zed, make for another piece of Hollywood junk that was simply made to get our price of admission, Oh yes, I almost forgot, gratuitous 3-D, which could not save this absurd, hollow movie. The original, rich with characters of all kinds, should have been left to age gracefully instead of being followed-up twice now with 'crapola' films.",3,11,25,3 June 2012
Skyfall," Skyfall....Bird droppings
","I haven not seen a Bond movie in years, but I watched a trailer for Skyfall and got ensnared. I think they overspent so much on the opening sequence, that the producers told them to 'pull in the sails' for the rest (over 2 hours) of the shoot. Daniel Craig sure knows how to pose (and run) because that's about all he does, and speak in a practically inaudible mumble for most of the movie. Bardem knows how to ham it up. The gratuitous scenes and references to past Bond movies was so juvenile and obvious, well you can see I was disappointed and depressed by this claptrap. Judy Dench was totally wasted. The only good scenes were with Albert Finney, and I wish there were more!",4,7,16,18 November 2012
Terminator Salvation," The future is worse than could be imagined
","From the first two Terminator movies, particularly the first, we were given some indication by Reese how bad things had become in the future. They're worse, much worse. This installment is incredible in it's effects, intensity, and the tie ins to the first two (I completely discount #3, which I thought was horrible). Christian Bale is at his best, he's not Batman, he's John Connor, exhibiting an intensity as only he could. The machines were massive, scarier than one could ever imagine, and more cleverly conceived that anything I've ever seen. Forget Transformers, which I thought was for kids anyway, this is the real deal for creativeness and execution.Some surprise tie-ins to the first two installments only add to the fun. I loved it. McG, nice Directing job!",9,3,6,3 June 2009
Underworld Awakening," Holy Smokes!
","Underworld: Awakening, true to the series, but the best yet, different form the previous films, and I think we are in for more. Saw it in IMAX 3D. WOW! Spectacular, I ducked more than once. Non-stop action...Selene (Kate) is as awesome, or more so, than ever. And you are in for a big surprise concerning her....ooh...creepy and scary. And where is Michael...well we find out late in the movie and a fifth one is definitely in the offing...yea! I usually get into the technical points in my reviews, but no need here...just sit back and enjoy. 88 minutes...well I thought that this would be a rip off, no way...it seemed much longer than that. I think that's because of all the action and the no-nonsense way in which the story is told.",9,3,8,5 February 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," State of the Art Movie-making
","David Fincher...Best Director, Rooney Mara...Best Actress, Daniel Craig...Best Actor. Oh yes, and whoever the editor was......Best Editing! From the opening credits, which grabbed me into the mystery to the incredible editing (the movie could have been 4 hours long were it not for the editing) and the incredible story (thank you Mr. Larsson)this is one hell of a movie. I don't think I have had such an experience as this movie gave me....EVER! (and that's saying a lot, because I have been a movie buff all my life, an actor, writer and director) and a play reviewer for the past 5 years. This movie is probably not for everyone, but I suspect, a few million people will. Oh yes, Rooney Mara, I was blown away by her performance!",10,5,20,20 December 2011
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What's the point?
","Who cares that Leo is a movie actor and Brad is his stunt double? Leo had the meaty scenes and Brad was totally wasted. A couple of his scenes reminded me of his characterization of Billy Bean in Moneyball. The ending was a total fabrication as the Tate, LaBianca murders were completely overlooked so Leo could plat with his flame thrower. Stupid, stupid, stupid!",2,4,9,20 August 2019
Gone Girl," Far-fetched
","Gone Girl is the most far-fetched piece of crap I have ever seen. It is one of the biggest scam movies ever perpetrated on the public! That said, David Fincher is one of my favorite directors. I have seen all of his movies and watched them many times, always discovering something new to appreciate. I will never watch this one again. Fine acting, great background music by Trent Reznor, good photography, but a story that is so ridiculously exaggerated that I was waiting for the next twist so that I could witness how much more absurd the story could become, and there were several of them. However, it did make me feel relieved that I was single again.",6,4,35,3 October 2014
Super 8," Super 8 - horror-able
","Super 8 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What was the point? The seventies are over and Spielberg was in his 20's unknowingly making classics. Trying to go back and copy successes of those bygone days.....why? To cash in once again? Well, here's the deal: Those of us who are old enough to remember the 70's were 35 years younger and just as naive as Spielberg. But, it's 2011 and we have witnessed the evolution of the sci-fi genre (and I must say it's one of my favorites and has come a long way, particularly with the MARVEL classics and the sophistication with which they have been transformed to the screen). Poor me, having gotten sucked into buy a ticket. The movie made no sense (I could list about 25 scenes which were gratuitous, senseless, and poorly executed). I think anyone with an IQ below 78 might enjoy it. Elle, get a real job, because your sister has it all over you and her choices are far above yours, and please get your teeth fixed. I couldn't help but be distracted by your back teeth which seemed to be either rotted out or missing. Couldn't you have gotten some caps?",1,17,41,13 June 2011
Jack Reacher," Cruiser reaches and gets the prize
","Enjoyed this movie on a few levels. Fun movie, good escapist movie, Cruiser leaving the smile home (I'm so tired of it), the twists and surprises, the appearance of Robert Duval brought gasps from the packed house (priceless stuff, his scenes with Cruise brought back memories of Days of Thunder), Rossamund (nice rack, couldn't take my eyes off it)good acting in a difficult role, the comedic lines to give the suspense and tension a rest (brilliant). Now my minuses: Low-budget picture that owes its '8' rating by me due to the solid writing,directing, and acting, crappy car chase scene, and clichéd bad-guys. Billed as 'A Tom Cruise Production' (is that why the budget is given as $50mil, did Tom get $25mil of that?)Oh yes, where did Tom get the haircut?",8,4,12,27 December 2012
The Departed," Overrated!
","Once again another movie with potential ruined by a confusing, poorly edited ending. Thelma, maybe you should finally retire to the SAG home (if you are a member). The ending had all the earmarks of a Quentin Tarantino movie, and Mr. Scorsese should be ashamed of himself for copying a master, who was making movies such as this 15 years ago. I left the theater thinking of The Bourne Supremacy, with it's twists and turns, and superlative ending and comparing this mish-mash I had just seen, leaving me feeling confused, and wondering why such an intriguing first half was totally debased, hacked up, and ruined by Tarantino theatrics, which are best done by him anyway. Great cast and good performances by all concerned, except Mr. Scorsese, his editor Thelma Scoonmaker, and the writer, or should I say 'adapter', since this movie was taken from another script.",Null,1,2,15 October 2006
The Social Network," Thought Provoking
","How about a movie without sex, violence, or even a kiss? How about a movie that is thought provoking, inspiring, smartly written, directed, and staged? How about a movie where a relatively minor character is a scene stealer and a person to remember (I'm referring to the Dean and his scene with the (V boys)? This guy was spot on, as was everyone else, including Justin Timberlake, who I always thought was a flake. I totally enjoyed this movie and it is only the second movie this year that I would recommend (the other being Inception). I guess I'm not 'cool' though, don't have that first billion yet. David Fincher is one of my favorite Directors and has created a totally unique and intriguing concept for the movie, as he always does. Aaron Sorkin's script is amazing and together the two have created a classic movie, bereft of the usual movie junk, and have told the story, which seems as real as could possibly be, from Zuckerberg's mind.",10,3,7,4 October 2010
