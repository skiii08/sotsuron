The Longest Yard," Very fun
","The similarities between the British version and this film are obvious. The only essential difference is in the choice of sport since soccer has no popularity in the US, and therefore the choice fell on football. Although at the first glance you may think that this is a typical sports movie, but that is not true, because 'The Longest Yard' is a collection of comedic fun dialogues, scenes and events that revolve around the game itself and its preparation. The cast in this is a great achievement. Central figures are Adam Sandler in his characteristic role and Burt Reynolds who starred in the original movie. The central duo has excellent support from Chris Rock Terry Crews, Bob Sapp and rapper Nelly. Even the star of American wrestling Dalip Singh appears on several occasions. Truly, a great team, that easily creates entertainment for the viewers.",10,0,1,17 November 2015
