Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I laughed until I cried. Shows a mirror to America's dark side.
","Story: Barat comes to America and travels from New York to California. It is a road movie, and most of the episodes are real people saying and doing outrageous things. There is a framework of staged scenes to create storyline. Review:This is clearly the funniest movie in years. I laughed so hard that I cried. When I was at the movie I thought that most of the scenes were staged, and found out later that it was mostly real. The realness makes this even more remarkable, even though some of the fake scenes are memorable too. Of course this is an outrageous mirror showing America ugly things. I am worried about foreigners seeing this movie and getting an even more negative idea of Americans. I have read a review in German. It is one thing for Americas to laugh at Americans, and another to have the Germans believing that Americans are this bad. Mostly it shows that Americans are a little stupid and maybe too polite. So is this a great movie or just a good one? Movies need to be both enjoyable and meaningful to be great. Since this movie had a real purpose and because it was the funniest movie in memory, I must give it a top rating. On the other hand, it is mostly entertainment, and not a documentary, even a biased one like Fanrenheit 911. My wife noticed that the IMDb ratings for women were much lower than for men. Nonetheless, she liked the movie a lot. I think it is helpful to know that the movie is a satire, and not a affirmation of prejudice. Still this is not a good date movie.",10,1,11,4 November 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Moviemaker confuses lust for love in lonely shepherds. Movie fails as allegory for homosexuality in America.
","Two hands at a sheep ranch have sex during one lonely summer, and continue the relationship into their adult life, creating love triangles with their future wives. It explores the power of homosexual lust in adult men. Later in life they face discrimination because of anti-gay stereotyping.This movie is a story about how sex between two lonely young men gets confused with love. Some interpret the their relationship as a love story and see the movie as an allegory for homosexual lovers in 21st century American society, but this is a false analogy. The men don't really love each other, they don't do the things lovers do like take care for each other, communicate through letters or phone calls, laugh at each others jokes (very little smiling in this movie), or even go fishing together. The men are motived by good sex not love, and the movie explores the power of sex to complicate life, in this case tragically. The best part is the relationship between Ennis and his wife Alma (Ledger and Williams). This relationship takes place in the real world not the pretend world on the mountain. Williams gives the best performance in the movie.There are a number of distracting side plots, and in the end the movie peters out.",5,8,48,21 January 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Powerful and meaningful movie about a terrible civil war.
","This movie is set during the Rwandan civil war with its great brutality and ethnic cleansing. The movie is about a hotel owner who tried to keep his family, guests and many refugees alive.It is a powerful and worthwhile story that is moving and emotional without being melodramatic or too preachy. Don Cheadle contributes a good performance.The power of this story is the power of the events it is about. Good supporting performance by Fana Mokoena as General Bizimungo.The most affecting parts are the scenes with the killer rebels and thug soldiers who run the city. I like the realistic confrontations and the feeling of fear & terror the movie provided.Because it is essentially a true story, the movie makes me think about it could have turned out better. I afraid that the world really was as powerless as Nick Nolte's UN Officer. This is sad too.",8,0,2,5 February 2005
Crash," Strong Movie. Some top quality, gripping scenes strung together in a loose-knit story.
","A series of characters united by their involvement in a auto crash in Los Angeles are explored in the 24 hour period prior to the accident.The movie follows this web of stories which focusing on prejudice and racism. The movie is not completely dark, some of the behavior is so bigoted that it is funny, and there are several minor acts of heroism.Crash is a series of powerful scenes among different characters in a large and talented cast. Most memorable are the troubled Sondra Bollock character confronting her husband and then coming to grips with her loneliness. Don Cheatle's character has several excellent moments.There is an astounding scene where a young person is shot -- very gripping.With so many good performances, the directing must be the cause. Kudos to Paul Haggis.Finally the movie makes you think about the sad condition of humanity and the briefness of life. Perhaps a little preachy, but not too much, no demerits for that.Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ludicrous, and many more",9,1,11,7 May 2005
District 9," Clever Viral Marketing Aside, The Film Isn't Very Good
","I am tired of hearing about the clever marketing campaign, and how cool the preview showings were. Objectively, this movie was not very good. The first half of the movie is a political allegory, and the second half of the movie is an action movie. The whole movie is told with a hand-held camera in a documentary style, that works for a while, and then gets annoying. The character development is awful, and Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley, is creepy and unlikeable. Copley is competent enough, but he is played as simply nerdy and the performance did not have enough depth. The only alien with a personality was the baby alien. The rest are just targets for abuse. On the bright side, the art direction was solid, and the initial premise of the story is interesting. I don't know how they animated the aliens, but that seemed realistic throughout. They were pretty ugly, and they spent a lot of time wiggling their facial appendages at the camera. This is a Sci-Fi, and it does not need to make sense, but this movie makes less sense then most. There are too many plot twists that have no purpose except to advance the story. There is a tradition of Sci-Fi that is darker and scarier than recent Sci-Fi films. This film is trying to channel that tradition, and maybe it succeeds in bringing Sci-Fi back to its roots -- on the other hand, better dialog, more character development, and more attention to the plot would have helped.I ordinarily give a extra points for taking on a tough political or moral issue, but this was a heavy-handed morality play. The messages of this movie -- something like, 'People are terrible,' and 'Be nice or the aliens will get revenge,' -- do not seem worth the effort.",4,68,138,16 August 2009
Batman Begins," Top notch superhero movie. A great movie for fans and wannabe fans.
","This is an outstanding super hero movie. I had a lot of fun, even though I loved the Tim Burton Batman movies, and did not really want to see this movie made. Batman's super powers are not so super, and the treatment of the mental and spiritual nature is more in depth. I liked the tie between the childhood fears and the batman character. It was refreshing that there was no 007-style comic relief. Top performances by Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. The art direction was solid, but not as great as the Tim Burton films. The movie gets 8 stars because it is a great movie only in its own universe of super hero movies. It does not really tell a universal story--only a story about how a guy becomes a superhero, which of course is make-believe.",8,6,9,18 June 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Meaningful and enjoyable. Great visuals. Loved it.
","Plot summary: A woman boxer with a reluctant old coach nearly become champions before (MAJOR SPOILER) she is paralyzed and faces euthanasia.There are subplots with the coach feeling guilty about something, an estranged daughter and the fighter's deadbeat family.Performance by Hillary Swank is top notch. Morgan Freeman & Clint Eastwood are solid, although I think the directing & scriptwriting are the greater talent in the guys' performances. The photography and visual style are superior. I loved the texture of the scenes, especially the old gym. The movie's story is not predictable, but every step is leading to the final climax. More than all of this, it was fun to watch. The is a meaningful movie about the purpose of life that is still enjoyable. My nitpick is that I don't like mercy killing. I personally think a better ending has her battling back like real-life hero Christopher Reeve. I think some Prozac would have made all the difference, but I respect the artistic sweep of the movie, and how it needed to end this way.",10,1,3,29 January 2005
Avatar," Spectacular Movie Entertainment
","Great movie entertainment that is simply spectacular with action, emotion, and movie-house morality. I really liked the realistic way the animated Na'vi moved so gracefully though the trees, and later through the air. The movie characters were evocative and emotional -- unlike most motion capture characters, and even better than Lord of the Ring's Gollum -- far better than Disney's A Christmas Carol. Writer/director Cameron rapidly sets up the conflict between the humans and the Na'vi. Jake and the audience spends a long time with the Na'vi, and the wonderful visual world they inhabit. The audience is won over by the time the bulldozers arrive.Although the story is predictable, that is because it is archetypal. The story is like the European migration into North America and the displacement of the native Americans. Visually it is more like Europeans coming to tropical Africa -- perhaps like displacement of natives in Nigeria for petroleum. There is the more elemental conflict between the spiritual, grounded and connected natives with the mechanized and money-grubbing humans.Sam Worthington's performance as Jake shows his emotional shift in loyalties, and this is the best performance in the film. The supporting characters are one-dimensional. Zoe Saldana's Neytiri is combative and cat-like. I am not sure she handles the slow scenes as well as she might. I liked seeing Sigorney Weaver too. I want to see it again.",10,3,8,19 December 2009
Inside Man," Good entertainment with many good performances, but basically escapist entertainment.
","Assuming that you saw the trailer, everyone knows that bank robbers take hostages, and somehow the bank robbers dress up the hostages to look like themselves.The movie is entertaining and fun to watch. I most enjoyed the supporting characters --people like the individual hostages, and the detective's wife. All these little roles made the movie better.The main story is about how are the robbers going to get away with it, and there are some clever twists, that are pretty satisfying.My main objection and why this is not a GREAT picture is that it is only a cops & robbers movie that is done for fun. It is not about any greater theme. The movie is fun to watch, but other movies are fun too. That makes it seven stars.",7,2,3,25 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Fun, but I'm a fan. Weakest of the four. Needs more heart.
","Harry enters a grand wizarding tournament, but is in over his head. First of all, I enjoyed this movie, and I want to see it again on video. I am a fan however, and no one who has not read the book could ever follow the story -- especially the end. So if your a fan you should see it. They do a nice job with certain scenes, and it is fun to see them. On the other had, it is not a good movie. It does not hang together as a story for a non-fan. The characters don't engage enough. Everyone is expected to know the whole backstory and even recognize the actors from the other movies. This movie strikes me as a marathon to pack in as much plot as possible, and it does not have enough heart. I liked some of the story simplifications, but it needed more interplay between the characters. The young actors have been good and continue to be. The best part of this movie was the dance scene. This is the weakest of the four movies so far. That may be because the three contests of the story are hard to make into a movie. I would have trimmed it down to two contests or simply made two movies out of it.",5,0,1,19 November 2005
Wedding Crashers," It looks like a party movie, but actually its a sweet romantic comedy. Some funny parts.
","It looks like a party movie, but actually its a sweet romantic comedy. Some funny parts.Two guys crash weddings for to meet girls cheap. At a wedding with a rich well-connected family both guys fall in love. Many weird characters.I did not really care for the beginning, because two guys are not really very likable. It gets better when Rachel McAdam's character enters the movie. Good performances by Owen Wilson , Rachel McAdams and Jane Seymour. I liked the creepy gay artist brother.This movie has some mild message about love being more important than one-night stands, but that message is not really well delivered, and I think more guys will come away from this with clever ideas for crashing weddings than will decide to build an enduring relationship.",6,3,6,23 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I loved it. It was thoughtful and fun. Vader is a complex villain we sympathize with.
","Vader is a complex villain we sympathize with. I liked almost everything about this movie. From the action packed opening scene to the tortured soul of Ankin as he toils with loyalty to his wife and loyalty to the state. This movie delivers real ethical dilemmas. The weakness of this movie is that there is so much action and plot that the emotional connections are not well explored -- So no acting Oscars, but my rating system gives extra points for ambition and operatic sweep.You may have guessed that I am a fan, and Lucas was true to the fans by completing the story faithfully.",9,2,6,21 May 2005
Lucy," If you have any love from Magic-Reality and Non-linear Story telling then see it.
","Plot: Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is forced to be a drug mule, but the bag holding the drugs in her stomach bursts, and she gets a super-mega dose of a psychoactive drug -- this supercharges her brain and gives her great intelligence, mind-reading, body morphing, and other super powers. She tracks down the rest of the drug mules in Europe, and the drug lord tries to get back at her. She keeps developing and growing until she can't anymore.Review: I loved it, and I want to see it again. It has a magic-reality, non-linear story telling style that I like, but everyone doesn't. Everything isn't literally happening or true like they show it -- you are seeing the symbolic reality. Cloud Atlas was like that -- and many people never understood what was happening there. There is a lot of philosophy speak, and it is the same way -- it is a symbol for philosophy -- you don't need it to make sense to 'Get it.' See Major Spoiler at the end. I loved Scarlett Johansson -- who gives us a great tearful phone call to Mom, and a kick ass super hero too. Morgan Freeman is great, but I am tired of him playing a scientist. I get it that he can be geeky without being threatening, but let's move to the next generation.There are several good visuals including the cheetahs eating the antelope, Lucy's hand morphing scene, and who expected a pile up of French police cars. Cast: Scarlett Johansson, Morgan FreemanWritten and directed by: Luc BessonRating: 4.0 stars:. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it. Major Spoiler:. OK: This is really the same story as 2001 Space Odyssey. We see an ancient ape making the step to humanity (the first Lucy.) and the we see a modern human (the modern Lucy) making a step to be come a trans-human or star baby or the singularity. We see that everything we need is really all in our head already. We see that reality is much simpler than we thought it was.",10,7,23,26 July 2014
RED," Entertaining Mindless Bullet-fest
","If you have read down this far in the review list, then you know the plot. Frank (Bruce Willis) is getting the old spies together to take down the bad guys. The plot is a rehash of a dozen movies like A-Team and Rambo III where old guys get together and fight for justice. This version kept moving, and the support cast was strong including Mary-Louise Parker, John Malkovich, Richard Dreyfus, and especially Helen Mirren. Helen delivered some great lines that were fun to watch, sadly she was not in the movie that much. RED worked as a movie, and I enjoyed watching it. Head tough-guy Bruce Willis is not interesting or likable enough, and he is the weak point of the movie. I'd like to have seen a dozen other actors. Bruce is bald, just like the cartoon character, but he is not really a very good action hero. I liked paranoid Marvin's (John Malkovich) paranoid rants that turned out to be just what the NSA was doing -- in terms of their listening to them and tracking them.The special effects were solid; they didn't achieve splashy. I did not care for the post card motif -- perhaps this is borrowed from the comic book. The end of the movie was pretty clever, and I liked that. I give this movie an average rating, so it is a five. Bruce Willis fans might give it a seven. More: I love Helen Mirren with a machine gun. She was the best!",5,3,12,16 October 2010
The Proposal," Likable Comedy With Alert Directing and Good Facial Acting
","This is a funny, enjoyable movie with alert directing and good facial acting. The chemistry between the Bollack's Margaret and Reynold's Andrew is fun to watch as they worm their way through the predictable consequences of an immigration scam. The story is that powerhouse publisher Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is in immigration trouble and blackmails her secretary Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) into marrying her so she can stay in the country. To make the lie believable she goes to Alaska to visit his family. As they get to know each other, the movie draws toward the inevitable happy ending. There are several good scenes including the dress fitting, Ramone the exotic dancer, the eagle stealing the cell phone, and just about all the office cubical scenes.ON REALISM: Margaret is a self-centered bully, and she treats people terribly -- early in the movie this is funny as a spoof of office life, like 'Devil Wears Prada.' In reality it is unlikely that Andrew would see anything in her. This plot is not-at-all realistic, and it is an excuse to set up the comic situations of the movie. The Proposal is good because of the dynamics between the characters within the context of the ridiculous circumstances. The movie is more believable than 'Star Trek', 'The Hangover', 'Up!', 'Terminator Salvation', and about as believable as 'The Solist'. This is light comedy with no redeeming social value, but it is well-done, and most people would enjoy it. MORE: They showed too many jokes during the preview. EVEN MORE: The end is OK, but they should have been more creative.YET MORE: Sondra Bollack looks great for 45 years old.",8,18,37,14 June 2009
