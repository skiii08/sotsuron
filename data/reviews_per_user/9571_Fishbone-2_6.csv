Alien 3," Great debut for one of the best directors today
","David Fincher is a genius. He creates an environment unparalleled to any other director today, with the possible exception of Tim Burton. Many people didn't like this film because it focused more on the people than the action, but I felt that by bringing us in to the characters better it made us feel more for them. It even made the movie a little bit scarier. The Alien series has featured great directors from the beginning. Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Blade Runner), James Cameron (Titanic, Terminator) and Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, City of Lost Children) are all brilliant directors. David Fincher can hold his own against them, maybe even surpass them. Alien3 was not the best of the series but it's without a doubt worthy of the Alien title. Anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about.",Null,0,3,31 May 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Gross, but cool.
","This was very much a Jeunet movie. I watched Delicatessen when I was a kid and didn't have an appreciation for it. (Growing up on Jeunet, Lynch and Cronenberg movies I'm lucky I didn't grow up to be a psycho) I have a strong appreciation for Jeunet now and this movie was no exception. It was the worst of the series, but considering how good the other 3 were, that's not surprising. This was a good film but not great. People who were unfamiliar with Jeunet were unable to truly appreciate this film, those who are familiar, loved this movie. Sure it's gross at times but very cool still. Also, anyone who thinks Perlman is a mediocore actor is a jackass.",Null,0,0,31 May 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Great but not without it's flaws
","First of all let me say that I'm a huge Tim Burton fan. Every movie of his that I've seen, I've loved. Sleepy Hollow is no exception. His directing gave this movie a great spooky feel. The only real problem I had with this movie were one or two flaws in the plot. For example, the romance between Ichabod and Katrina came far too quickly. There are other flaws I found but I can't give away any of the plot so you'll have to go see it for yourself. All in all I still gave this movie of score of 8/10.",Null,0,0,21 November 1999
Pitch Black," Best Sci-fi Horror in Years
","This is definately better than all the other sci-fi horror BS hollywood has been churning out the past years. That's probably because it isn't technically a hollywood film. Vin Deisel's performance is really what made this film, he played his character beautifully (if someone can play a convicted murdered 'beautifully'). The movie was made on a fairly small budget but since there aren't any really big name actors in the cast, they were able to spend more of the fx, and generally they did a good job. The eclipse scene is really beautiful. Also, I'd like to compliment the design staff of the film on creating a monster that wasn't generic. I'd go rent this movie as soon as I had the chance if I were you. I gave it an 8/10.",8,0,0,10 October 2000
The Game," This is what I call a surprise ending!
","Even though this entire movie was great, the ending had to be the best part. It comes totally out of the blue and knocks you on the side of your head. David Fincher is one of my favorite director and constantly produces great films, this one is no exception. Go see it. Now.",9,0,1,12 December 1999
Any Given Sunday," Truly a great football film, if not the only great one.
","I am not a huge fan of football, although I do watch it on occasion. I have watched a lot of sports movies and never thought any of them to be very impressive, but when I saw the preview for 'Any Given Sunday' the first time I knew this movie would be different. I truly loved this film, all 3 hours of it. I was even impressed by Jamie Foxxs' performance. Hell, even LL Cool J did a good job. Even if someone is not a fan of sports movies, this movie will definately be the exception for them. It was for me.",8,0,1,3 January 2000
