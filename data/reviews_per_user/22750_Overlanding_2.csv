Blade Runner 2049," More hardcore and richer than the original.
","Considering movies like 'Black Panther' are being considered the greatest super hero movie of all time, it really does not surprise me that something as dark and hardcore as Blade Runner 2049 is not well received.To appreciate and enjoy this movie, you need to be a true Cyberpunk fan, otherwise you'll just be wasting your time and money.The movie is long, but necessary. Rich in details and things you could easily miss if you have ADHD or maybe a short attention span.This movie is a twisted dark beautiful masterpiece. In ways better than the original.If you don't like this movie, here's the door to the Marvel, and Disney films.:)",9,0,10,22 February 2018
Ender's Game," Possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
","Holy moly. This is absolutely terrible. Its so clich√©, so trash.The acting is terrible. The premise of the story is very basic and boring.'ecks dee, 12 year old saves le world because of how le super smart he is.'Jesus, their attempt to mimic military lifestyle is absolute garbage.I haven't read the book but the movie probably puts it to god d*mn shame.What a cheesy cringey snoozefest. I'm about to just shut it off half way through.",2,3,6,12 March 2017
