Casablanca," Ah, the burden of it all
",I always liked Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman (in the right film) but nevertheless I rate this film as one of the worst ever made. All you have to do is listen to the dialog and think about the plot and I'm sure you'll have to agree. Every situation in this film manipulates the audience to feel pathos for this starcrossed pair. I'm onlysurprised they didn't invent a worldwide law that somehow would prohibit the two from being together. It's that absurd. It also wouldhave helped if the two principles had some chemistry between them. These two act like each word they say to the other is going to somehow determine life and death. The malarkey about Ingrid's husband (who apparently is the ONLY person who can save the world) being nonfunctional  without her is probably the biggest nonsense the viewer must swallow. I laugh everytime I see portions of this film. It's unintentionally hilarious.,Null,2,5,29 August 2003
Saving Private Ryan," Pretty bad history
","I was hoping for an accurate war film for a change (take a look at the Battle of the Bulge for a really bad example). What Spielberg shows us in his Omaha Beach scenes makes me wonderwhich Omaha Beach assault he is trying to portray. Those who know little about the battle (that's almost everyone who's in the theater) probably now have the idea that every other soldier who landed on the beach before noon was either blown to smithereens or badly wounded.Believe me, the 1st and 29th Divisions would have been annihilated if itwere as bad as it's portrayed and would never have been able to scale the cliffs and rout the enemy by early afternoon, which they did. I wonder, for example, how wide most viewers think Omaha beach actually was. In the film it looks about a couple hundred yards. It was, in actuality, almost ten miles wide. The timing was also inaccurate - Hanks goes up the cliffs at what appears to be 8AM. Nobody made it before 11AM. Another historical error is the implication that the events at Omaha were similar to those on the other four assualt beaches (Juno, Sword, Gold and Utah). That's totally incorrect. Utah Beach, for example, the other US assault beach, took about a dozen casualties - many of those due to accidents during the landing rather than from enemy action. But the worst part of the movie was the completely idiotic script. Here we have the US Army sending a squad(a squad!!!) to march straight thru the entire German 7th Army (something two Divisions, with total air superiority couldn't do for weeks), waltz around an area of 300 square miles, and expect to find a guy named Ryan. If they wanted to do any of this nonsense, the Army would have sent them in on the gliders that flew into the area the very next morning. 'Gliders, what gliders'?  said Spielberg. That's what happens when you have a scriptwriter who doesn't know very much about his subject.  A stupid, stupid film. What a waste of $100M or so.",1,90,202,1 September 2003
Saving Private Ryan," Not a valid portrayal of Neptune
","The problem with Saving Pvt Ryan is that is is basically afraudulent portrayal of the Omaha Beach landings. Every single detail may, for all I know, be authentic for the group portrayed, which I assume was Goranson's Company C, 2nd Rangers. But that company, with one notable exception, experienced the worst that Omaha Beachdealt to the assault troops during the hours 0630-0800. Thus you get an extremely biased view of the typical experience of those landing at Omaha. For example, the entire 5th Ranger Battalion (Col Schneider) (6 companies) landed at 0740 with a cost of only 4 wounded.  It all depended on where your landing craft touched down (or allowed it to touch down - Col Schneider was supposed to land right where Hanks was , Dog Green, but had the sense to order the craft eastward), and Capt Hanks landedat the very worst spot on the entire 4 mile long landing area. And troops walked up the slopes, they didn't crawl up, inch by inch, etc. Nor where they under murderous fire ascending the slopes - very few casualties were taken during those actions. Total casualty rate for the first 14,000 or so troops that landed in the first assault waves (0630-0800)was not much over 10%, far different from what you see portrayed in Ryan. If you want to learn the history of Omaha Beach read the US Army after action reports or go the US Army Historical site. Don't bother with this movie or Ambrose's nonsensical book or The Longest Day. They are for made for entertainment purposes and only mention the disasters,etc. Beside, Ambose has been known as a plagiarist and creater of non-existent eyewitnesses.( It's worth noting that he was hired by Spielberg to 'authenticate' the scenes. He's a very poor historian and not very knowledgeable about WWII. I found tons of errors in his books about D Day and Citizen Soldiers). Anyone who sees Pvt  Ryan comes away with zero knowledge of Operation Neptune at Omaha Beach. After the beach scenes,the rest of the story can be summed up in a single phrase : 'Call the 101st on the radio, and tell them to pull Ryan from the line.' That's all that the Army would have had to do to save Ryan.Sending a squad thru enemy lines to search a 100 square mile area for a guy named Ryan, while fighting is occurring every 100 yards is about the most preposterous idea for a story I ever heard of. But then, that's Spielberg. Anything to get the customer excited. No matter how realistic the scenes may be (I wonder about why those Rangers are moving against a prepared position all bunched together - they would never have done that ) the total picture provided the viewer is totally unrealistic. One comes away from the movies knowing practically zilch about Omaha Beach. That's a damn shame. It was an interesting story, although nowhere near as gory as Spielberg's fantasy portrait, as is obvious from the casualties taken (approximately 2000 for the 24 hours of D Day by Forces 'O' and 'B' (60,000 troops)).",1,81,182,22 October 2003
Saving Private Ryan," It's not history, although ambitious
","Spielberg set out to make a realistic depiction of the Omaha Beach landings to kick off  his film, which is about a fictional mission of a squad to rescue one Pvt Ryan, of the airborne, dropped inland behind the beaches. One glaring idiocy of the film is why they would dispatch soldiers from the Omaha sector to rescue someone droppedbehind the Utah sector, especially when 4th Infantry Div soldiers arealready in contact with a large portion of the airborne troops. The answer is, of course, because that gives Spielberg his opportunity to display the Omaha landings rather than the Utah beach landings next door, which were too easy and lacked any bloody combat. If the only thing anyone knows about the V Corps landings at Omaha came from this film, then they would have been better off skipping the film, or at least the opening scenes of battle. Read a book and learn what happened at Omaha. You'll find that it wasn't anywhere near as bloody as Spielberg's film leads one to believe. Omaha Beach was considered bloody only because of comparison with landings at the other 4 beaches, which were virtually walkovers. The rest of the movie is not much to see, with many errors in the combat sequences, especially with respect to tactics that would have been used. Spielberg's film is badly flawed as history, and the story is downright unbelievable - why not radio the 101st  and order Ryan off the line? Why send a few guys to walk thru the entire German 7th Army and search in a 400 square mile area for some guy named Ryan? The US Army wasn't always the most efficient, but they would never have sent off a squad on such a cockamamie mision.",1,33,74,9 March 2004
Seabiscuit," One of those rarities, a movie that is accurate
","Seabiscuit the movie departs from reality in a couple of places - for example the meeting between Charles Howard and Tom Smith didn't occur as shown, although it's true to the character of the two. The cinematography was quite good and to my knowledge the only effective filming of horse races in movies. The fact that the story really happened as portrayed needs to be emphasized because, quite frankly, otherwise it looks like something that Hollywood dreamed up. The book is a better source for all of the details of the story but the movie is effective as only film can be in bringing the viewer an actual image.  A very fine book and a very good movie. The best movie I've come across in  quite a few years. Saving Private Ryan tried to be realistic, but when the plot is considered, it's an inane film that portrays D-Day in a way quite contrary to the facts.  Seabiscuit follows the facts probably about as well as the medium allows.",Null,0,1,25 July 2003
Singin' in the Rain," Best musical comedy
","This is without doubt the best musical comedy I have ever seen, and I think I've seen all of them that mattered. The dialog and plot isexceptional for a musical. It would be excellent even without the music. The dance scenes are great, especially the 'hoofer' routine with Kelly and O'Conner - it's the best dance number I've ever watched. And I don't care much for dancing. What's amazing is how well thisfilms holds up. It's as funny and intelligent today as it was back in the early fifties. And why not? People are the same now as then.",10,1,5,29 August 2003
