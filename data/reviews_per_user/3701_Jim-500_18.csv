The Blair Witch Project," Look for the aftertaste
","The Blair Witch Project is an original, quirky flick that is not all that it seems.  Like most people, I had heard all the hoopla about its hype and Internet shenanigans before I saw it.  Going into the theatre on a dreary day (and in a tired, down mood, to boot), I was ready to be put to the test.A few minutes after the flick ended, I looked at my friend and we both said the same thing: 'What a lame movie!'  It was true, it seemed.  This had been much ado about nothing.  Sure, it was an interesting idea, but come on.  A group of kids basically screaming and cursing (the latter much more so) about their fate in the dark woods, to the point of being annoying.  So I left the theatre somewhat disappointed.But then a strange thing happened.  Several days later, some of the movie's more effective shots began coming back to me (and,  much to my dismay, at night).  The three cairns piled outside the tent in the morning. The human figurines hanging silently from the trees.  The little surprise package, wrapped up in a piece of the missing Josh's shirt.   In short, the movie was starting to work some odious magic on me.  I began to feel, for one of the few times in my life, a sense of true horror and dread, or at least something close.  And I began to consider the existence of all of those unseen powers and forces we know from Stephen King and other horror stories. Do they exist?  Could they exist?  Who knows--that is probably part of the game.  We will never know, until it is too late, as it was for the trio in Blair Witch Project.The only thing I found unbelievable about this movie was at the end, when the filmmakers are in the house, and they know full well that something awful is about to happen, yet they are still shown with their cameras to their eyes, walking around filming everything.  I'd be so scared I sure would not be worried about my camcorder at that point.But that aside, The Blair Witch Project has both the capacity to bore as well as the capacity to frighten.  But whatever you experience, be wary for the aftertaste.  It might just get you.",Null,0,1,14 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not for me, sadly
","This new Star Wars installment has action, aliens, music, drama, special effects, good guys, bad guys, destiny, space ships, and an elaborate plot.It has many other things too, but the one thing I found it didn't have was FUN.This show completely reeked of over-indulgent self-importance and pomposity. All the talk about inter-stellar taxes left me cold.  Can you name a scene in this flick where people actually have a good time for the sake of having a good time?Fun is what made the first three movies so special; the characters acted human, and they didn't take themselves too seriously.  But these folks are all one type of heroic archetype or other, and seem more concerned with following a script than being normal.  Even C3PO, the cyborg, was more human than these handsome devils.And please lose the accents.  A serious English accent coming from a hero automatically deflates the story and calls attention to itself.  Once the heroes opened their mouths and they sounded like Prince Charles, I knew it was going to be a long few hours.",Null,0,1,10 May 2002
Star Trek," Disappointed
","This movie didn't do much for me. It seemed like it was so wrapped up in the novelty of the characters' previous lives and the slapstick of them uttering familiar phrases for the first time that it strayed from the path of something meaningful. That's not to say that it had to be profound, but that's what the original series was all about. I also thought the original series stressed the importance of peace; at the end of this flick, the crew joyfully engages in bloodlust. In the action scenes, as is the modern style, once again we're treated to a manic roving camera that's so all over the place that it's hard to tell what's really happening. Instead of the camera telling a story, we're assaulted with hard-to-follow action that leaves us limp and uninformed. This is just my opinion, of course. Not being well versed in Trekdom, I know that the real fans are getting more out of it than I did. Some of the more obvious humor was enjoyable, and I bet the movie is loaded with in-jokes for the true devotees. But so many people I know have been singing the movie's praises. I just didn't get it. I was looking for something better.",4,13,22,28 May 2009
Insomnia," Confusing
","Insomnia is good until about two-thirds of the way through.  Then it gets very confusing.  People act in confusing ways, and say things you don't understand why they say them.***Spoilers ahead***The main thing that confused me was the bit about the boyfriend.  Robin Williams mentions that the kid has a gun.  Based on this, the cops ransack the kid's room and take him to jail.    All of a sudden the kid's possession of a gun makes him the main suspect.  But why?  The girl wasn't shot.  It doesn't make any sense.Also, near the end, Dormer is asked if he shot his buddy on purpose or by accident.  We know it was an accident, and he knows it, too.  But now he says 'I don't know.'  The only reason I think he'd say this is to squeeze more time out of the plot.  It could be argued that he's become delirious because of his lack of sleep.  But it's not believable, because we identify with him, and we know he's innocent.The climactic scene, which takes place at the killer's summer home, is suddenly foist upon us with no reason.  Why in the world would Hillary Swank drive all the way out there all by herself?  The movie makes a big deal about how she's the idealistic junior cop who sops up learning like a sponge (a la Jodie Foster in 'Silence').  Does it make any sense that she would take this risk?  I guess common sense was overriden by the First Rule of Suspense Movie Endings:  The female sidekick should always get herself alone with the suspect, so she can be hurt but then saved by the REAL hero (a man), and set up a hackneyed, shoot-em-up ending.I also got completely confused by all the evidential guns and bullets that changed hands, and why they did so.  I didn't find it possible to keep track of which gun was which and which bullet was which.Anyway, it's not that bad of a movie, but I have a feeling it's another example of how Americans can take a good foreign book or movie and turn it into something trivial and cliched.  At least they didn't opt for the False Ending, where the dead psycho is not really dead; this one floated in the water, and then sunk like a rock.  Or at least that's what we think (do I hear a call for Insomnia II?).",Null,0,0,4 June 2002
Yes Man," Formulaic but enjoyable enough
","I wasn't sure what kind of a movie this was when I entered the theater. Based on what I'd heard, I thought it might actually be helpful in finding a new outlook on life, that it might teach new insight, based on the tag line 'One word can change your life.' Well, it didn't. When Carrey's friend tries to introduce him to his new-found freedom by breaking a pane of glass, and the convention guru talks about sexual self-pleasure, I knew the flick wasn't meant to be taken seriously (nor was it well-written. Both scenes were very awkward.).For me, the movie ended when the motor scooter pulled up at the gas station. I felt I knew exactly what was going to happen for the rest of the movie, and I was right. Trouble was, this scene occurs well before the movie is even half over.I sometimes find Carrey's madcap antics annoying, but because he keeps them in check in this film, I found him more enjoyable than usual. Less is more!",5,1,2,2 March 2009
The Devil Wears Prada," Too many holes
","This could have been a good movie if it didn't have so much that didn't make sense. When Andy has become comfortable in her new job, she is handing out gifts to all her friends, and they love it. Then all of a sudden, for no reason we ever see, they complain that she 'isn't the same old Andy.' Just because she is working hard? We never see any evidence of her being anyone different than she was at the beginning. She misses her boyfriend's birthday party because she had to work late? That doesn't mean she's a bad person. And she shows that she's sorry in a very sweet way. But I guess we're supposed to hate her now. Then one of her girlfriends sees this high-power writer guy make a pass at her, which she quickly snubs. But the friend acts like Andy was into it, reminds her about her boyfriend, and walks off in a huff. It makes no sense--Andy clearly was not into the guy, but her friend acts like she was. Then the way Andy just completely disses Miranda at the end, after they have come to mean something to each other, would have only made sense in the middle of the movie. Here, it comes off as just a convenient--but illogical--way to end the show. Then boyfriend Nate takes her back, despite the fact that they have two new jobs in two different cities; how they are going to stay together isn't even brought up. Speaking of Nate, he seems like an understanding, regular guy, the kind who would support his girlfriend in whatever she wanted to do. Working like hell in your first job in New York City? It's an incredible opportunity; no way would his character suddenly decide that her career was more important than him. Of course, it probably was just a plot device to make it okay for Andy to fool around with that writer without any guilt, and this tete-a-tete sets up a twist near the end. This movie seems to want to be an insider's look at the rough-and-tumble world of fashion; I found it unbelievable. Not that I don't believe you have to work for demanding bosses and cut down the number of personal hours in your life; but to think that your friends would abandon you because you're pursuing a dream doesn't ring true. And there is the crux of the problem: are we supposed to be angry with Andy, or Miranda, or the seemingly inhuman fashion world? We're never given a consistent sense of who's the villain here. In the end, the most unbelievable thing for me about this movie was how Andy was deemed 'fat' by the fashion world. Come on; nobody would ever consider Anne Hathaway fat; not even the Devil.",Null,29,48,3 July 2006
The Shining," Can't believe I didn't like it
","This movie has two things going for it: style and eyebrows.The visual style is quite handsome and well done. Intriguing sets, odd colors, and a sense of large, sinister space inside the hotel. This was the first movie to utilize the Steadicam camera, and it's put to good use.The musical style is also effective. Bizarre 20th-century classical works (similar to the ones in Kubrick's 2001) enhance the spooky and creepy nature of the action.And of course, we have Jack Nicholson's eyebrows. I don't believe they've been put to the test before or since. They're very effective in letting us know what's on his mind.But if you take all this away, you're left with a very confusing story. Okay, so the hotel is haunted. Somehow along the way we find that one of the characters may be from the past, and then that seems to be confirmed at the end. But so what? What does that have to do with the story? Why is that important? What does that have to do with the hotel? Why do the scenes from the past matter and how do they fit in with the story in the present? I saw the movie when it first came out, and just watched it tonight, 30 years later. I wanted to give it a second chance. But I felt exactly the same way both times. I found it boring, not scary, somewhat predictable, and ultimately unsatisfying. Style is grand, but it cannot make up for a story that doesn't make any sense.",Null,4,10,19 September 2011
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A simply great movie
","Terminator 2 is, for my money, one of the greatest films Hollywoodhas churned out.  Everything in it is top-drawer: the script, acting,directing, special effects, etc.  And you can't mention superlativeswithout discussing Brad Fiedel's music!   In this flick you get chases, incredible special effects, cool kid stuff,twists, paradoxes, and even biting commentary on the sexes.   Ontop of everything else, the movie also has a lot heart, with sometouching observations about humans and non-humans.  And, ofcourse, it also deals with where we're going as a race and thepossible catastrophes we're headed toward.  But far from being adesultory comment on the end of everything, it also has a ton ofhumor--some obvert, and some extremely subtle.  And the endingmay just bring tears to your eyes.Robert Patrick, as the T-1000, is one of the great modern movievillains.  He never lets up, even when knocked down time aftertime, or having his head blasted in two.  He runs like a human, butdoes not take setbacks like one--he gets up and keeps comingafter you.  And that's one of the things that's endearing about the twoTerminators--they are super-strong, but not supernatural.  Bulletsdon't stop them, but they do slow them down.  Thus we're able toidentify with them to a degree.As far as chilling scenes go, who can forget when Arnold iswalking toward John with the box of roses, only to toss the boxaway as he pulls out a shotgun?  And the T-1000's manyresurrections, especially the one of him slowly trolling along on thepolice motorcycle, surveying the ruins of Dyson's living room?Some people are undoubtedly put off by the series' titles, thinkingthat these are crazed, violent movies with nothing to recommendthem.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  You'll definitely begetting your popcorn's worth with T-2, and a lot more.",Null,4,4,7 December 2003
Silver Linings Playbook," Doesn't know what to do with itself
","I felt this film was a mess. It starts out promising, with Bradley Cooper's slightly off-kilter gaze proving quite unsettling. You know he's been through a lot, and he knows it, too. We wonder what his next move will be--as does he. In the meantime, he's doing meaningful work with his shrink, who takes his job seriously.But then he meets The Girl, and the movie slowly morphs into a madcap romantic farce. Goofy parents get involved, the shrink becomes a drinking buddy, and all sense of seriousness vanishes. The scene in Cooper's living room stretches on endlessly as subplot after subplot play out, and drama and comedy are mixed so you don't know how you're supposed to feel about any of it. Is this Rain Man or Abbott and Costello?The old saw in movies used to be, Boy Gets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Gets Girl Back. Nowadays, it's Boy Gets Girl But Is Too Stupid to Realize It Until She Knocks Some Sense Into His Head. Of course, this rarely happens in real life. Silver Linings has The Girl for a while and then loses her, but neither the writers nor the director were able to get her back.",4,22,42,10 January 2013
Meet Joe Black," Good but for Pitt's mouth
","Overall, this is a good movie.  The death scene in the beginning is one of the most unexpected, violent and memorable since Psycho.  And the scene where Anthony Hopkins says goodbye is heart-wrenching.But what brings this movie down is Brad Pitt's inability to speak clearly. His role demands a smooth talker.  His lines want to crackle with enunciation and spice.  But Pitt has always talked like he has a mouth full of marbles.  Here he sounds like he is reading a line, instead of talking, because someone who speaks that way wouldn't choose words unnatural to his cadence of speech.This isn't to put Pitt down.  It's just to say that he was not a good choice for this particular role.",Null,1,2,25 June 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," For some, not for others; still remarkable
","I think there are two types of movie-goers.  The first type wants anobvious story.  And heck, I think that is what the fundamentalpurpose of a movie is: to allow us to sit for two hours and to beentertained while munching on popcorn.   Lots of action and colorare also desired stimulation.The other type wants the same thing, but will also accept 'think'movies.  This is the type that doesn't do that well all of the time,especially on television.  This is good entertainment, too, but at thesame time its plot elements aren't always so clear.  This, however,is not a mistake; it's done on purpose to leave us thinking,wondering, and talking about what we've just seen.  It's harder tomake this kind of movie, because you just don't follow formula. But when it's done well, it can be a wonder to behold.2001 is the latter type of movie.  Most of the movie has nodialogue.  The plot is unclear.  The characters are not clearlydrawn.  But it is so well done, the mystery of the film's messageoutweighs all of these items.  Rather than have a narrator spellthings out for us in the beginning, and explain them in the end,we're left to do that for ourselves.  And when we begin to arrive atconclusions, we realize just how good this movie is.I think it's unfair for people who don't enjoy 'think' movies to putdown 2001.  Once you accept it, think about it, and talk about it, youhave to admit that it's well done for what it is.  For people who likethat kind of movie, it's a tremendous, memorable achievement. For those who don't, it's not right to say that it's slow and boring. There's a lot going on underneath the surface; it just takes somework to find it.",Null,0,2,7 March 2004

(And even if you don't, I have a feeling you'll grow to appreciate it!)I just bought the DVD 'special edition', which contains over an hour of outtakes.  Two scenes that I wish had been in the movie: one where they're taking listener calls at a radio station, and one where Derek is showing clips from a movie that he was in.  They're absolutely hysterical.

This Is Spinal Tap," Terribly funny
","For everyone who has ever attempted something, and experienced some bumps and bruises along the way, this movie is for you.  One of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  And of course, it's all the more funnier if you are aware of the pop music life, and what we're led to believe happens.  Nope, despite what 16 magazine told us, the glamorous rock life isn't all it's cracked up to be.I once took a group of friends to see the movie at a local college.  One of the girls didn't understand it, and thought the guys were 'ditzy.'  She thought it was a real documentary!  Now that's funny.",Null,0,2,28 April 2003
Super 8," The script should have taken a cue from itself
","After hearing a bunch of hype over the much-ballyhooed J. J. Abrams, I went to this movie with high hopes. I love making films myself, and thought watching a movie about how you made a film before iMovie would be fun.But it turns out that Super 8 really has little to do with kids making films; rather, it has to do with some secret Air Force plot involving a mysterious being.After a spectacular first act, the film devolves into a lot of malarkey involving strange sounds in the dark, angry townspeople, and military folk with suitcases full of little white cubes. The strange being is revealed, but this only creates more confusion because its origins are barely explained, and after they are, it's difficult to care about them because this plot point has nothing to do with anything else in the movie. We then see some equally confounding scenes involving a big hole in the ground and a water tower with a story arc that defies understanding. And then, before you know it, POOF!--the being is gone. But again, this was anticlimactic; since we knew so little about the whats and whys of the action, there was no reason to care about it.Early in the film, one of the boy filmmakers tells his friend about how important caring about your characters is to your story. Well, after a while, I didn't care about these characters, mainly because the story was not there. Why things happened the way they did was never explained, and both the characters and story took a back seat to a never-ending cacophony of senseless explosions and fire in which absolutely no one ever seems to be in danger. That does not make for a good movie.",3,1,3,16 June 2011
War of the Worlds," Still wondering...
","Steven Spielberg is amazing in how he can make some of the greatest movies, but also produce such dogs. War of the Worlds has some great special effects, but in the end it is maddening in that so much of the flick leaves you unsatisfied.I won't go into the many plot holes so many have talked about (e. g, how the son can show up at the end of the movie completely unscathed). Rather, there were two small moments that set up possibilities and then didn't deliver. The first is when Tom Cruise and his neighbors are gathered around the crater in their street. Cruise picks up a piece of the asphalt to examine it. He says it feels cold; he then places it into his jacket pocket. Normally, this is a foreshadowing cue; he is doing this for a reason, and the promise is that somewhere later in the movie, that piece of asphalt will come in handy in some clever way. But it doesn't make another appearance. So this scene was completely unnecessary; him putting the rock into his pocket does not make any sense.The other time is when Cruise and Tim Robbins are trying to elude a snake-like creature in Robbins' basement. Suddenly Robbins appears with an axe and is about to rain blows down upon the creature. But at the last second, Cruise stops him and silently mouths words (that the audience doesn't understand) to get Robbins to put down the axe. Ahah! Cruise must have some sort of ingenious backup plan! Can't wait to see what it is!But there is no backup plan. We are never given the reason for him stopping Robbins from killing the alien. Just another scene that makes no sense. Steve! You're killin' me! I love ya babe but you're killin' me!",5,0,0,9 August 2005
Wedding Crashers," Sorry, not very funny
","I've noticed a trend in American comedies lately. The formula is thusly: you take some somewhat well-known, sometime comedic actors, give them an unfunny script, and then sit back and ask them to make us laugh. This happened in Meet the Fokkers, Guess Who, and most recently, Wedding Crashers.I'm not saying Wedding Crashers is completely awful. In fact, of the three, it's probably the funniest. But so many times, as in the other two flicks, it sets up a scene or situation that simply doesn't deliver. In a scene of touch football, for example, Vince Vaughn is laid flat on his back by the dopey villain character. He can barely breathe; but nobody seems to notice. What's so funny about that? Is he really hurt? How badly? Or is he faking? Why? The situation lingers, so we expect something additional to happen, but it doesn't. I think the trick here is that the audience feels it is supposed to laugh, so some do, even though nothing funny is happening. And then the movie goes through the same exact routine again.And then there is a scene where the same evil guy shoots an innocent Vaughn in the backside with a shotgun for no reason other than anger. The payoff? We see Vaughn having the shot removed from his bare butt. This is funny?The subplot of the young gay relative is excruciatingly bad. The boy is miserable, but then he is used as a whimsical anti-gay plot device. There is nothing funny about homophobic comments about a suffering young man, evenor especially when they come out of the mouth of his doddering old grandmother. If this character had been over-the-top with a lisp and designer clothes and a supremely confident and cocky attitude, it could have been funny, for it would have been teasing his flamboyancy. But here it is just cruel. Christopher Walken is completely wasted in his role. He merely reads his lines; his character could have been played by anybody. When he walks into a room where Vince Vaughn is tied up in bed, we wonder if he will have some sort of witty comment or go into a creepy Christopher Walken monologue about ropes? But for some reason, he does not see the ropes, which makes no sense at all. He sits on the bed, recites some lines, and leaves. Boring.Rachel McAdams, on the other hand, chews the scenery in every scene she's in; I imagine her website might have crashed from all of the hits after WC opened. But she's the great one in an otherwise forgettable movie. Vaughn and Wilson have some good laughs early on, but from then on it's downhill. In a movie dealing with marriage, nothing is ever made of the fact that Vince Vaughn's love interest looks to be less than half his age. Jane Seymour's character places her into a Mrs. Robinson-styled situation with Wilson; but instead of Wilson's normal witty repartee, all he does is look scared, and the scene ends. Will Ferrell has a cameo that goes absolutely nowhere; when that situation became apparent, the director must have told him to start shouting obscenities in order to try to make it funny. There is only so much one can do with a script and direction that don't deliver. You can't put people into odd situations and expect laughs unless you give them something funny to say or do. And having them yell or use dirty language does not help; instead, it smacks of desperation.",4,8,16,9 August 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," A superb production makes Shawshank a must-see!
","The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about personal disaster, misery, impossible difficulties, and eventual triumph.  In other words, it's about life.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a young banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sent to the Shawshank Prison in Maine for life. There he meets Red, an older con played by Morgan Freeman.  From there on, the movie is viewed through the eyes of Red, and Freeman's moving commentary surfaces during key points in the flick.  Most of the movie is about the friendship between Andy and Red, and the different travails they encounter. The two learn  about the meaning of hope, and how one must keep going despite the odds.All this sounds pretty pat and boring, but the movie most assuredly is not. It has a brilliant mixture of brutal violence, gentle lyricism and uplifting moments coming from the most unusual of places.  This could only work with a top-notch group of actors.   The inhuman actions of Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) are enough to turn your head from the screen.   This is tempered by the relaxed friendship between Freeman and Robbins, as well as the camaraderie inside Red's group; William Sadler as the stuttering Heywood is terrific.  James Whitmore is touching as Brooks, the oldest inmate who is so used to prison life that he can't leave.  Gil Bellows (Tommy) has a small but pivotal role; his superb performance changes the momentum of the entire movie.   And the triumvirate of Brown, Mark Rolston (Bogs), and Bob Gunton (Warden Norton) set the tone of evil in the prison that only the wiles of Andy and the compassion of Red can surmount.Some critics say that the movie is too slow.  It's slow like a baseball game; its leisurely pace is belied by the amount of strategy underneath. An important moment happens in almost every scene, whether it's Brooks crying, Red making a joke, or Andy slyly getting the best of the system, the end gradually creeps up on us until the surprising, heartwarming finale. The last scene is one of incredible cinematic restraint; the camera actually pulls away from the action, preventing us from seeing the expressions on the characters' faces.  We strain to see, not because we need to know what they are feeling--we already know.  We just want to see as much as we can because it is so wonderful.I haven't said much about what happens in the movie.  Let's just say that it shows how one's mind and knowledge are more powerful than concrete walls, mental intimidation or physical force.The Shawshank Redemption was not seen by as many people as it should have been, undoubtedly because of its un-sexy title.  Don't be turned off.  It's one of those movies that can draw you in and give you a lift, no matter what kind of mood you're in.  It's one of the most satisfying movie experiences I've ever had.  See it.",Null,0,0,6 February 2000
