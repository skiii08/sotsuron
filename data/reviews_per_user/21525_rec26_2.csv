The Ring," did any one else think this movie was average?
","I saw this movie the night after Halloween and couldn't help but laugh every time i heard the screams of my fellow movie goers. (which happened to be about every ten minutes)This film has lots of good things going for it. It is scary enough in unique ways although of course it relies on the conventional 'scary methods' as well. And since I am from Seattle I am biased in that respect as well.The main problem I had with the movie is that it doesn't really make sense. AND I happened to watch 'Psycho' the night before and i noticed that 'The Ring' contains a shot where water is going down the drain and the shot is almost an exact duplicate of a similar shot in 'Psycho' after Janet Leigh is murdered.My advice: If you are a guy, watch this movie with a girl.",6,0,0,2 November 2002
Gangs of New York," Unbearable
","3 hours of crap.Point blank this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Keep in mind that I only say this because this movie should be good. (Decent actors, big budget, Scoresese, etc.)Instead this movie just falls flat on its 3 hour face. This movie is almost as bad as 'Waterworld'. I think this movie could have easily cut out 60 minutes. (It would still be bad but at least not the kind of bad that makes you want to run off the nearest sufficiently high place, all the while screaming curses that would make a sailor blush.)If you have been waiting all your life for a movie that could combine insulting predictability with the length of 'Pearl Harbor' then this is the movie for you.",1,15,33,20 February 2004
