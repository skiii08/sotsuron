The Benchwarmers," Funny movie
","Very crude humor; shades of the 1970's Bad News Bears movies.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.The lopsided score in that last game reminded me of a game the Detroit Tigers played with the Philadelphia Athletis, I believe.Ty Cobb was suspended for going after a heckler in the stands.The 'ersatz Tigers' lost, 24 to 2.When *I* went to the Benchwarmers, I had a private showing.Why, I do not know.The Adam Sandler movie was very cute.Reggie Jackson made a cameo appearance in this film. I was surprised.",7,0,0,29 April 2006
