Blade Runner 2049," Homage to the previous film
","I absolutely love this film. First of all, Ryan Gosling is incredible in his performance. It's epic by itself though. But it couldn't be as good without its background story. The lighting, the shades, the color even the rain remind me of the previous Blade Runner. By the way, the scene of the rain in the first film made me cry uncontrollably. Definitely worth viewing many times.",10,0,8,2 November 2017
