Black Swan," Natalie Portman is hot!
","My girlfriend dragged me to this movie tonigt. I though, oh crap, it is about ballet. To my pleasant surprise, Portman spends a good 20% of this film touching herself. The rest of the time is spent with her running around either scantily clad or in a tutu. What more do you really want from a film?As for the movie, it is kind of a horror flick I think. It starts with an ominous, dark feeling, and just gets worse. It isn't a feel good movie and is actually kind of depressing. It is gritty and a downer, but very well made and disturbing movie. Did I mention Natalie Portman is hot and spends a good part of the movie getting it on with herself? Worth the price of admission for this alone, and for this I give it full marks! Now, I'm off to the shower!",10,3,14,15 December 2010
The Expendables," Does it get any worse than this?
","First off, I like action. Terminator 1&2, Die hard series, Predator, Crank, Running Man, Under Siege, Bloodsport, Rambo, Fight Club, Bond, a few of the Rocky movies, etc... These are some of, and the kinds of movies, I like, some old some new. I don't mind cheesy, sometimes.However, this movie was a stinker. Stallone, and his puffy plastic surgery face, his pubic haired transplant hair, is disgusting to look at on the big screen. It sad, as I used to like Stallone. I just don't see any character in his face. He looks like an old, eyebrow dyed and plucked douche, and he is unpleasant to sit through for 2 hours. He has so many tight shots of himself because he is soooo full of himself. Yuck! Lundgren and Roberts look like guys his age should look, gristled, aged and weary, and tough, but Stallone looks like an LA Guido! That aside, the dialogue is weak and leaves you feeling icky. The characters feel bogus. There is no plot. There are loads of explosions and lots of gunfire, but after a while, who cares. 1000 bad guys can't shoot their heavy machine guns to hit guys point blank. Please don't insult the viewer like this. I don't care if any of the good guys live or die. Statham, Rourke, Roberts, and Lundren are the only decent name brand actors. I don't count the big name cameos. The rest blow chunks and leave you feeling nauseous.Take my advice and steer clear of this garbage. You'll thank me when you actually see this poop on video and am soooo happy you didn't blow your cash on this at the theatre.",1,20,39,25 August 2010
