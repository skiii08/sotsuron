The Avengers," Marvel-ous
","It was inevitable that The Avengers would be made, especially with the cinematic gold that was produced with the Iron Man franchise, Thor, and Captain America (though the Hulk films have struggled to find any kind of footing to speak of). In this critic's opinion, the individual productions dedicated to the aforementioned superheroes ranged from spectacular to borderline dreadful (I was especially disappointed in Captain America). To think that any one person could somehow blend all of these characters' story lines into something coherent—and, as implausible as it seemed, genuinely entertained—made me more than skeptical.But, as the saying goes, never say never. The Avengers is a spectacle to behold; it's thrilling, funny, and actually musters up quite a bit of unexpected character development. How about that?What makes it so fantastic is the fact that nearly every major player is given equal screen time. Wisely, Whedon decided to paint these otherworldly heroes flesh tone—that is, he makes them entirely human. Instead of being fodder for CGI carnage (which, paradoxically, they are, in a very good way) we become invested in them as individuals. They have their problems, and never is this more relevant than when egos collide aboard a floating fortress—a scene that almost sees the would be saviors of the world nearly tear themselves apart. Another well-played decision on the part of Whedon was to play up the sociological angle of the mayhem taking place. Specifically, the fact that the battle for humanity eventually moves to the streets of New York City evokes feelings directly reminiscent of the 9/11 attacks. This strikes a particularly vulnerable chord in most of us; even though it's been 11 years since the horror of that September morning unfolded, a general sense of unease still permeates our contemporary culture. The fact that The Avengers draws such clear cut lines between 'good' and 'evil' makes it unexpectedly powerful, and the musings by many of the characters that the world could do with a little 'old fashioned' reverie is certainly a well-founded one.Actually, I have only one gripe with the movie. It's probably too minor in many people's eyes to warrant mentioning, but, in light of the myriad accomplishments that define the movie, I simply can't ignore it. Specifically, it has to do with the Hulk's sudden ability to control his rage in such a way as to be mindful of what he is and isn't smashing. No explanation is given as to how he's able to do this in a hairpin moment of critical importance, and it's something that could have been easily resolved with a quick bit of dialogue or a thirty second scene.For everything that could have gone wrong with The Avengers, it's a miracle that it's actually watchable; actually, it's a wonderful piece of cinema, not to mention one of the best action movies that I've ever seen. If you haven't checked this out, be sure to do so before it leaves the big screen. Skipping it would be doing your inner kidheck, your inner human a great disservice.",9,1,3,26 December 2012
Black Swan," Not Nearly as Light as a Feather
","I've finally gotten around to checking out Darren Aronofsky's latest offering, and, I have to say, it certainly lives up to its reputation.Not many films are 'black and white' in terms of an intended subtext, and Black Swan is no different (though the sharp, monochrome tones that pervade the screen might suggest otherwise). In this instance, we see things from the perspective of Nina (Natalie Portman)—a ballerina who has high hopes of nabbing the lead role in a somewhat offbeat rendition of Swan Lake. Nina is a perfectionist, and as such she inevitably has trouble taking on the role of the Swan's 'evil twin': a being that works via lithe seduction. This, as Nina is informed, is a role that requires that she 'let go' of her more rigid tendencies as a dancer. Having been kept under the wing of her equally prim and proper mother—echoes of John Locke abound—it's no wonder that Nina soon begins to suffer a psychotic meltdown.Juxtaposed against Nina is Lily (Mila Kunis), a newly arrived performer from San Francisco who's everything our protagonist is not. Lily is, in a certain sense, a 'free spirit,' and she's able to assume the essence of the black swan with relative ease. The dichotomy/rivalry that emerges is fascinating to watch, as it's really a materialization of Nina's deteriorating psyche (in the most extreme sense, one could almost label this a 'loss of innocence' tale, though 'annihilation of normality' might be more fitting).To say this is the crowning jewel of Portman's young career is an understatement. She's brilliant as Nina, and I can't imagine anyone else having done the part justice. Kunis is great too, as is Vincent Cassel (the lusty director who does everything he can to bring forth Nina's inner bad girl).One thing to keep in mind for anyone interested in checking out Black Swan is that it isn't for the squeamish. There are some incredibly uncomfortable scenes that play out just as awkwardly as you might imagine, but, as much as I oppose an over-abundance of raunchiness, I'll concede Aronofsky's directorial prowess and say that it certainly did add a worthwhile element of depravity that might otherwise have seemed elusive.So, after all that, would I say that Black Swan deserved the accolades that seemed to have been endlessly showered up on it.Yes. It's symbolism made tangible on celluloid. It is, in the most primal sense, the true embodiment of 'art'.",9,1,4,26 December 2012
Frost_Nixon," Mesmerizing
","Quite honestly, Frost/Nixon is a movie that, based on the trailers and other promos, looked somewhat tedious. I should have known better. Thanks to the skilled direction of Ron Howard and the extraordinary acting of both Frank Langella and Michael Sheen, this is the best exploration of the workings and motivations of a U.S. President that I have ever seen.The story follows David Frost, a comedic television host whose career is on thin ice, as he attempts to setup a televised interview of then ex- President Richard Nixon. His initial motivation is clearly anchored in the projected ratings/financial gain that would come from the four part series, but, with aid received from a pair of academics, one of whom is played by Sam Rockwell (who has recently had two great roles, including his stint in Moon), Frost begins to see the achievement that could be obtained if he's able to break down some figurative walls and broach the topic of Watergate as no one else had been able to do. People are skeptical of Frost's ability to effectively interview the troubled, often evasive Nixon, and, to add insult to injury, the funding for the project–which is acquired through the solicitation of various sponsors– begins to dissolve mid-interview.Howard approaches Frost/Nixon, taken from a stage play bearing the same name, as if it is a documentary. The story is clearly told from the various perspectives of the major players involved in the process of making the interview a reality, and, as boring as that may sound, it works incredibly well here. The show-stopper, however (as you've probably guessed), is Langella's portrayal of Nixon.Through his facial expressions, the depiction of Nixon's characteristic tendency to sweat when agitated, and the delivery of his dialogue, we learn a a great deal about a fascinating historical figure. There's an especially hair-raising scene when Nixon, who had been decimating Frost in the interviews, calls his adversary the day before their final interview session. Nixon had been drinking, and he goes on a tirade in which he discloses his motivations, his fears, and his thoughts on life. For me, this, more than any other scene (except, perhaps, the final interview) is where Langella is really able to flex his acting 'chops' and show us what he's got. He paints a portrait of Nixon as a deeply troubled individual who wants nothing more than to show those who said he wouldn't be able to ascend to the top that they're wrong. Here, Langella injects Nixon with a an almost tangible lust for power and scarily reveals his intolerance for any sort of resistance. Earlier in the film, we also witness the greed stewing in the former President, when his PR/marketing assistant, Swifty Lazar, expertly depicted by Toby Jones, mentions the amount of monetary compensation he'll receive if he decides to participate in the interviews. Nixon interestedly raises one eyebrow and quickly recants his desire to abstain from participation in interviews. Oddly, though, Nixon is humanized at the film's conclusion– we get a clear sense of the loneliness associated with one person's determined ascent to power. This is a move that some may find disconcerting, but it feels completely natural, so Howard won't get any complaints from me.If you haven't already done so, add this to your Netflix queue. You won't regret it.",9,2,3,27 December 2012
The Hangover," Modern Raunch at its Best
","Ever since Wedding Crashers, there seems to be a winning Hollywood formula for comedies: include as much shock value/gross out humor as possible, and intermittently sprinkle in some scenes that allow actors to deliver equally shocking (and, of course, witty) dialogue that doesn't give the audience much chance to catch its breath for the duration of two hours. The Hangover sticks to this formula in many ways, but it also surpasses it on several levels. The random, seemingly haphazard nature of the events which occur in The Hangover are just enough to separate the film as a worthwhile entry into the ever- expanding catalogue of R-rated comedies.If you've seen the trailers for The Hangover, you're already familiar with the plot. Doug Billings is getting married, and his buddies Phil and Stu have decided to treat him to a pre-wedding weekend bash in Las Vegas. Also along for the ride is Doug's soon to be brother-in-law, Alan (more about the brilliant performance of Zach Galifianakis later). Once there, the group quickly heads out for a night on the town. When they awaken the next morning, their $4200 per night villa is completely demolished, and there's a tiger in the bathroom. Strangely, they have absolutely no memory of the previous evening's occurrences. They soon discover that Doug is missing, and realize that in order to find him–and ensure that he's home in time for his own wedding–they have to play 'detective' and figure out exactly what happened.This is one of the few movies I've seen that actually benefits from a plot that feels cobbled together. It literally seems as if the writers decided that they needed: A) a baby in a cabinet, B) Mike Tyson singing, C) a stolen police car, D) a scene with the main players getting shot with a taser. All of this serves to highlight the eccentric nature of The Hangover and its characters, especially that of Alan Garner. Honestly, everyone else in the movie pales in comparison to Alan and his antics, be it his decision to use Carlos the baby as a puppet; his assumption that wearing white pants, a tee shirt, and satchel out onto the casino floor is perfectly acceptable; or his questioning the clerk at the front desk of Caesar's Palace about whether or not the actual Caesar lives there. Galifianakas delivers each and every one of his lines with an uncanny amount of deadpan wit that you almost feel sorry for everyone else–essentially, they're all playing the 'straight man' to his character.To avoid revealing too much about the developments in The Hangover, suffice it to say that there's no way they would've ever gotten out of Vegas given the stunts they pull. The movie is aware of its own ridiculousness, which is perhaps just as well, but I would've liked to have seen these guys really sweat things out and get their just desserts. With the exception of Alan, they all throw a few temper tantrums, but we all know how things will conclude–and, in the end, things do play out exactly as you'd expect them too, making this not quite as risky as, say, another ridiculous, self-aware comedy: Pineapple Express.So, all of that taken into consideration, what's the verdict on The Hangover? It's funny–at times downright hilarious. In many ways, we've seen it all before, but the quirky nature of Alan–and the seemingly random plot developments–make it stand out. If you're looking for a carefree night at the movies, The Hangover is a sure bet.",9,1,2,27 December 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Choppin' and Droppin'
","I read the Seth Grahame-Smith novel that Vampire Hunter is based on a year or so ago on a whim. I was shocked to find it an engrossing piece of writing that skillfully blended an off-beat version of horror mythology with the multi-faceted political climate that defined American during the Civil War. What's more, the protagonist—none other than Abraham Lincoln himself—was a vulnerable character; one that seemed every bit as flawed as Joe Schmo next door. He'd loved and lost, and any nobler purposes that have defined him as a historical legend were cast aside to reveal his true passion in life: vengeance.Chalk it up to the quirky title or the ridiculous juxtaposition, but the novel was a near instant success. As is usually the case in these situations, spinning the book into a feature film was inevitable. I was well aware going into the theater that much would have to be sacrificed to make the thing watchable (and to maintain a reasonable run time), but I was shocked to see that the subtlety of the novel had been shredded in favor of bullet-time action sequences—the sort that hurl you from one location to the next without allowing a moment to process the significance of what's just happened; the sort that kick you in the head with their stupidity; the sort that just don't make any damn sense.To be fair, it's not all bad news. There are some thrilling sequences, but the clunky transitions that attempt to further the narrative are grating (and the same sorts of associations readers were able to make with Honest Abe in the novel just aren't there on the big screen).As a rule, I try to avoid comparing a movie with its literary counterpart as it's my conviction that the film should be examined of its own merit. Here, though, I found this an almost impossible task, as I kept mulling over the squandered potential. In essence, what director Timur Bekmambetov and his colleagues have turned in is a Cliffsnotes version of a unique story. I get the feeling they wanted something suited for popcorn-munchiness, and there's not necessarily anything wrong with that. But they should have considered the nuances of the source material; the narrative butter that would have made the whole thing much tastier and easier to swallow. In leaving that out, audiences are dealt a stale serving that's half burned. You know, the sort of thing that gets stuck between your teeth and it's an infuriating nuisance until you're able to pry it out with a toothpick in hopes of achieving sweet relief.",4,1,2,26 December 2012
Inglourious Basterds," The Alternate History of WWII
","Quentin Tarantino. Love him or hate him, there's no denying the man is an auteur who has changed modern filmmaking. His films ooze a peculiar flair that, more often that not, is reminiscent of the 'style over substance' breed of movies from yesteryear. Tarantino has a dark sense of humor that tends to balance out his absurdly complex (though sometimes serious) plots, and, thankfully, he's got an eye for characterization that tends to save his movies from oblivion.Though I enjoyed his recent Death Proof, it was somewhat underwhelming when viewed in the context of his other goliath, game-changing offerings (though that was the whole point, I still felt there was more that could've been done–and Death Proof is one instance where I think he let his 'too cool for school' dialogue get away from him). But I digress; we're here to talk about Inglourious Basterds, a movie that's had a lot of buzz surrounding it ever since it went into pre-production.Basterds is unlike anything Tarantino has ever tackled, yet it's strikingly similar to what I consider two of his greatest films–Kill Bill (Vols. 1 & 2). It explores the familiar theme of revenge, has the same 'Chapter' scene dividers, and even recycles much of the same music for its soundtrack. Some might view this as lazy filmmaking, but I think it's a sign that Tarantino is starting to mature as a director. Like all noteworthy filmmakers with certain stylistic hallmarks, he seems to have found his rhythm, as it were, and has crafted a movie that's more emotionally resonant than any of his previous offerings.The opening scene, for example, is simultaneously understated and absorbing. It features Tarantino's trademark dialogue—as do virtually all other scenes—and it gives all of the players involved a chance to fully flesh out their characters. To avoid spoilers I won't go into detail, but suffice it to say that it'll have your heart thumping; it's also immediately evident that Tarantino has become a master of wringing every drop of emotion from his actors and actresses.Then, in the very next breath, we're thrust into the realm of Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and his squad of Jewish-American soldiers known as 'The Basterds.' Their mission is simple: to brutally murder Nazis and spread fear throughout the Third Reich. Forget what you know about the history behind World War II—though there is apparently a kernel of truth as to what inspired the plot, Inglourious Basterds is, on the whole, a completely fictitious endeavor. While this has upset some critics, it is, in many ways, a credit to Tarantino as a writer, as this decision causes us to remain on our toes throughout the entire 153 minute runtime (because, of course, we have absolutely no idea how the events in the film will unfold).But I digress. Let's return to our previous topic—that regarding the violence found in Inglorious Basterds. As you'd imagine, Tarantino allows Raine and company to accomplish their assigned mission by forcing us to watch the most gruesome of occurrences (such as captured German soldiers being scalped, knifed, and beaten to death with a baseball bat). While the subject matter automatically calls for an undisclosed amount of violence, there are times—as with his other films—where it's obvious that Tarantino is indulging his own insatiable desire to douse the screen with blood. The question, then, is this: Is all of that gory violence a bad thing?Essentially, Tarantino has used the backdrop of World War II to create a combination revenge flick/dark comedy—but Inglourious Basterds is so much more. What makes this stand out from his other movies is the fact that it's often deeply serious—much more so than I would've imagined, in fact. Many critics have found the movie disrespectful because of the liberties it takes with history and its comic nature. I take some contention with this assessment. Based on the emotion present here (and the care with which its so skillfully woven into what would otherwise be a blood and guts revenge story), it's clear that a fair degree of 'respect' was front and center on the director's mind as he worked on this uncharacteristically affecting piece. Really, Basterds is a sort of non-comedy that knows how to keep its very adult themes serious without being so serious that they're steeped in an inaccessible gloom that makes viewers feel cold and detached from the things happening on- screen.My only problem with the movie has to do with the shift in tone found at the ending (I'm talking the end-endthe very end). Based on the level of maturity found throughout the bulk of the movie, it felt just a little too out of place—just a little too whimsical, perhaps—and it seems to undermine an especially powerful scene that appears only moments before.On the whole, though, Inglourious Basterds is superb. It's got that certain Tarantino flair, and, if you can handle the gore, you'll see a smartly written movie that's both entertaining and emotionally gripping.",9,2,4,29 December 2012
Coraline," A Different Kind of Rabbit Hole
","It was just yesterday when no one would've imagined an animation studio going toe-to-toe with the reigning heavyweight champion known as Pixar, but the creative minds at Laika studios have done just that. Coraline, which arrived on DVD and Blu-ray this past July, is a work of art from top to bottom. It's a real shame that it's taken me so long to sit down and review the film, but, at long last, I was able to devote an afternoon to taking in what can only be described as a truly exquisite feature.The story follows a young girl by the name of—you guessed it—Coraline. She's just moved from Michigan to Oregon, and isn't at all happy about having left her friends and the life she knew. This should sound instantly familiar to most moviegoers, as being displaced from a familiar locale is often used as a catalyst for unrest by many writers (it's the whole 'fish out of water' mechanism). What's especially relevant about Coraline's situation, however, is that she comes from the Motor City; her family has been forced to move because of the economy, and that's something many people can relate to. Symbolism is pops up in more tangible forms too; namely in the form of Wybie Lovat ('Wybie' is short for 'Whyborn,' which aptly accentuates the disconnect Coraline feels from her parents, who are constantly working in an effort to pay the bills).What makes Coraline so effective, though, is its perception of a child's imagination. As Coraline explores her early 20th century apartment home, she takes pleasure in the rusty water heater, the leaky windows, and an inexplicably small door cut into the living room wall. Beyond this door is a world that caters to all of Coraline's desires, and she discovers this through a series of 'dreams.' In this 'bizarro world' she encounters her 'other' family, who have buttons for eyes and pay her all of the attention she could ever want. The design of this colorful playground is reminiscent of a Disney/Burton hybrid: it's at once startlingly beautiful, but warped (and borderline Gothic) in its undertones. As the illusion of the 'other' world existing only as a dream is dissolved, Coraline quickly becomes immersed in a very dangerous situation. In fact, I could easily see this freaking out very young viewers. It's rated PG, but there are times when the creepiness abounds and the proceedings approach horror film territory.But let me return to the beauty of the animation. For the most part it's extremely fluid, and rarely does the realization that it's all stop-motion result in a distraction. One of the best ways to describe much of the art design is to imagine a Van Gogh painting (and, toward the film's conclusion, the echoes of The Starry Night are impossible to ignore). The smooth animation combined with the stark contrast between the gray 'real' world and the colorful 'other' world is mesmerizing, and I can't see a youngster—or an adult, for that matter—being able to look away. I watched it as a 2D Blu-ray, although it did give me the option for 3D. From one of the very beginning, in fact, it's clear that this was a movie made for 3D: a sewing needle remains motionless in front of the camera for a good 3-4 seconds, suggesting that an 'in-your-face' effect was the intent. This, combined with a relatively tidy conclusion, dampens what would be an otherwise unforgettable film.Still, it's more than worth your time, especially if you have children. Sit back, relax, and marvel in the beauty of what director Henry Selick has created. Just don't be surprised if said child wants to sleep with the light on afterward (you know, just in case).",8,0,0,26 December 2012
Iron Man 2," Solid
","Iron Man 2 is not The Dark Knight. And it shouldn't be.For my money, I can't think of a movie that better embodies the term 'popcorn flick.' Like its predecessor, this one is all about fun. There are rock 'em sock 'em explosions aplenty, as well as some slickly filmed fight sequences that are quite memorable (but, honestly, aren't earth-shattering when compared to any number of other uber-energetic comic book films of the last decade). Don't be fooled, though; this sequel to the 2008 hit actually builds on the mythos of Tony Stark in some welcome ways.Front and center in this particular feature is 'the past'—that is, it's very much focused on Howard Stark (Tony's father) and his vision of a futuristic society that thrives on the energy derived from his Arc Reactor. There are also some other juicy tidbits we learn about Stark Sr., not the smallest of which has a little something to do with rewriting the periodic table. Also thrown into the mix is a physicist who worked with Howard back in the day. He's a disgruntled Russian who feels he's been slighted because—among other things—of Tony's success. He's got a son of his own named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), and he's determined to avenge his father's legacy at all costs. Yes, the plot is driven by a stereotypical variation on the revenge story we're all familiar with, but, given the already superficial nature of the film (which, let's be honest, we all expected), it works well.Iron Man 2, quite simply, does everything a competent sequel should. In this case, it further highlights the flaws of its protagonist, and it builds on the comedy/action pairing that made the original film so successful. It even ties in new characters—such as Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff—who are fairly interesting in their own right while settting itself up for a third film that will (hopefully) continue the trend.Despite all its upward momentum, Iron Man 2 does falter from time to time. As is the case with many-a-movie, our hero solves seemingly impossible 'puzzles' in record time (here, we're talking about scientific enigmas that can only be deciphered with the use of improvised proton accelerators). This directly correlates with a looming sense of danger—developed by a specific plot element that I won't ruin here—that's established early in the film, and, because of this ridiculously absurd 'quick fix,' said surprisingly tangible sense of dread is undercut in an extraordinarily premature manner.But, again, what did you expect? This is Iron Man 2, not the philosophical diatribe of a makeup wearing psychopath. As tired as I am of this clichéd phrase, it still applies: 'It is what it is.' Because of that, there should be zero complaints.",8,2,2,29 December 2012
The Hunger Games," Hungry? Why Wait?
","When a friend mentioned to me a trilogy of novels that she'd recently gotten into—yes, Brittany, I'm talking about you!—I didn't know what to think. These books (the first of which is titled The Hunger Games) were an odd mixture of teen romance, brutal gladiator-style death match, and satire of the widening gap that separates those of us who are wringing as much out of every paycheck as we can with those who own toilets made out of solid gold. Okay, so that's an exaggeration, but I quickly discovered something about these novels that seemed to appear out of nowhere and take popular culture by storm: they're great.I mean that. Even though I might have a quibble with a plot point here and some piece of character development there, The Hunger Games series as an intelligent—and often stark—exploration of the reality TV culture that defines our society.Fast forward two (or so) years. It was inevitable that the books would be turned into movies, and the world held its breath as news of controversial casting choices and what appeared to be questionable alterations to the fabric of the source material surfaced. And here we are: the movie has been released, the dust has settled, and we've been given the opportunity to lay our eyes upon the finished product. And guess what. It's great.For director Gary Ross and everyone else involved, they were working with a story so crisp—so inherently engaging—that the whole thing seemed to be a paint-by-numbers affair. If they could stick to the narrative and add in a little directorial flair when the occasion called for it, everything would be just hunky dory.For better or worse, that's exactly what they've done. Some people might complain about the implementation of the 'shaky cam' technique employed for the full duration of the two and half hour film, but I found that it to add to the sense of dread that's expertly built from the very first scene. When we're introduced to the twisted world inhabited by the evil Capitol and the corresponding Districts (who exist only to provide said Capitol with resources to keep it going), it's clear that The Hunger Games is a good old-fashioned David-versus-Goliath death match with clear lines drawn between the good guys and the bad.And the conflict proceeds just as it should. It's a fast-paced, gladiator style bloodbath that keeps its audience coiled in their seats. Even if you've read the novels you're still waiting for some of the marquis moments from the story to unfold just as you'd imagine them (and, familiarity or not, most of them turn out to be just as shocking as the first time you re-read the same paragraph over and over to try and process what you've just seen was actually taking place).Success though it is, The Hunger Games isn't flawless. For my taste, Haymitch isn't portrayed as the binge drinker that I'd envisioned (he's an alcoholic, sure, but he seems a little too I don't know 'with it'), and a few scenes seem to have scaled back for the sake of keep the runtime reasonable. Of particular note is Katniss' introduction in the Capitol; the grandiose spectacle described in the book turns out to be little more than a fleeting 'hurrah.' The final moments in the arena also feel somewhat rushed.Still, there's emotional gravity to spare, and even the stoniest heart will find him/herself practicing the three-finger salute on the way home from the theater.The future of the franchise seems to be in good hands, and I'm primed and ready for Catching Fire to be developed. If The Hunger Games is any indication, it'll be one of the great sci-fi/action sequels to come along in the last few years.",8,2,8,27 December 2012
12 Angry Men," Racism, Bigotry, and Stereotypes, Oh My
","I know what you're thinking: how in the heck did you just now get around to seeing 12 Angry Men? To be honest, I don't really have a good excuse. Maybe I just got too caught up with another film with '12″ (Monkeys) in the title.Regardless, I feel ashamed for having waited so long to take this one in. In short, this movie is absolutely brilliant. This isn't a revelation not already proclaimed by a thousand other critics, but I think it's worth noting for the simple fact that contemporary viewers (who might find themselves in my situation and realize they've postponed this for far too long) really owe it to themselves to embrace this multi-layered masterpiece that's just as relevant today as it was 54 years ago.The plot is deceptively simple: twelve jurors must decide the fate of an eighteen year-old on trial for the supposed murder of his father. Everyone on the jury is a male, and they're all fleshed out with nuanced detail. In fact, considering the entire thing takes place in a sweltering deliberation room, it's absolutely astonishing that director Sidney Lumet is able to concoct such a striking character piece that has a lot to say about the presumptions of society (again, both then and now). This, of course, it what makes 12 Angry Men the timeless piece of art that it is.But let's not ignore the flawless acting on display by everyone involved. Whether it's Henry Fonda trying to prove that nothing is ever certain or Lee Cobb bringing a father riddled with guilt to a violent and emotionally draining climax, it's all superb. The directing is clean and efficient, too—this, among other things, gives said actors a chance to fully embody their personalities and draw the audience into a drama that's anything but black and white.It's clear that screenwriter Reginald Rose has a firm grasp on how to effectively use setting, too. As the mood and opinion shifts in the cramped room, so does the bipolar weather just outside the stubborn windows.I don't know what else to say. If you're like me and have a list of certified 'classics' that you're just now getting around to, trust me when I say that this one should be vaulted straight to the top. Give it a minute or so to get going, and you'll find yourself glued to one of the most engrossing dramas I've ever seen.",10,3,5,26 December 2012
127 Hours," Rock On
","Danny Boyle has turned out to be the quite the multifaceted auteur. He's created unique examples of what are possible with both the horror and science fiction genres (at times blending the two), and he's tackled the grim reality of humanity in his Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire. It should come as no surprise, then, that 127 Hours is a beautifully filmed, expertly nuanced story about what fuels both delirium and perseverance.The movie is based on a true story. In 2003, canyoneer Aron Ralston decided to embark on a weekend hike in a mountainous region of Utah. After miscalculating a step while traversing a crevice, Aron fell down a sheer embankment and had his arm pinned against the cliff face by an oblong boulder. As you'd expect, a previously happy-go-lucky situation turns gruesome in a split-second, and, to make matters worse, it's only a matter of time before Aron depletes his limited supply of water and prepackaged goodies.A misconception that seems to linger about 127 Hours is that exists for the singular 'gross out' moment—you know, when our protagonist realizes his only chance of escape is to whittle away at this trapped arm until a bloody stump is all that remains. In fact, Boyle's film is more focused on Aron's life leading up to the accident, which is wrought with the misgivings of someone who's been much too selfish. As it turns out, it would take something as drastic as facing a life or death situation for Aron to come to grips with his passive-aggressive abandonment of everyone he's ever cared for.By allowing us into the mind of our lead we're able to experience how a dehydration-fueled delirium brought to light the things in Mr. Ralston's life that actually matter. So integral are these hallucinations that it's sometimes difficult to separate what Aron is really going through as opposed to what's taking place in his mind, but Boyle expertly balances his tale by bringing Aron (and the audience) back to reality when things seem to be utterly lost in a maze of all-too-tangible illusions.Besides the thematic victories that are embodied in 127 Hours, it's also —quite simply—a movie that's very easy on the eyes. The rolling canyons and red plains make for a stunning backdrop, and the horror unfolding in the small crack Aron inhabits serves as an effective juxtaposition to the sprawling beauty that's just beyond his reach (figuratively, literally, etc.).In short, Boyle strikes again. Pay the $10 for a ticket and catch this one before it leaves theaters.Trust me. It's worth it.",9,0,1,26 December 2012
"I Love You, Man"," It Has Lou Ferrigno
","Quite honestly, there's not a whole lot to say about I Love You, Man other than it's funny. Really funny. Even though (to the best of my knowledge) Apatow had nothing to do with the production of this film, it's representative of his usual humor–the pseudo 'true' behavior of the idiosyncratic, nerdy, 20-to-30 something male. If you enjoyed the likes of Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Knocked Up, this will likely be right up your alley, even though it's admittedly less complex (in terms of the interactions depicted by the relationships featured in the movie) than the latter of the two flicks just mentioned.The plot of I Love You, Man, as just indicated, is easily accessible (and, at times, easily predictable). You, as the viewer, know that at some point there will be a conflict between the developing 'bromance' between the characters of Peter and Sydney, and you also know that, ultimately, it will be resolved in some way, shape, or form. As with most Hollywood story lines, you can sense the ensuing equilibrium that our protagonist must achieve in order to maintain a peaceful existence.When I reference all of this, it's certainly not to bash I Love You, Man. Quite the contrary. Director John Hamburg is keenly aware of the clichés present here, and makes a decision that a lot of movie-makers just don't seem to have the gumption (or ability) to. He opts to include them only as bare necessities and let the humor take center stage.And the humor is fairly non-stop from start to finish. There's a real sense of authenticity to I Love You, Man, and the quirky inclusions of things like projectile-vomiting, bass-slapping in Sydney's man-cave, and a dog that looks uncannily like Anwar Sadat is the sort of comedy that you'd expect from the cast included here (and, of course, it works extraordinarily well). This is one of those movie-going experiences–like Liam Neeson's latest effort, Taken–where, when referencing the trailers, 'what you see' is literally 'what you get'. If you're in the mood for a movie that's laid back and consistently hilarious from beginning to end, you can't do much better than I Love You, Man.Oh yeah–did I mention that it also has Lou Ferrigno?",8,0,0,29 December 2012
Insomnia," Sleep Will be the Last Thing on Your Mind
","Christopher Nolan wasn't always directing caped crusaders and dreamworld desperadoes. Once upon a time (nine years ago to be exact) he was at the helm of a criminally underrated crime thriller by the name of Insomnia.Starring Al Pacino as a L.A. detective who travels to a remote Alaskan town to help identify the killer of a teen, this is one of Pacino's most recently truly great performances (a shame, I know). Hilary Swank and Robin Williams co-star as an up-and-coming local policewoman and deranged author (respectively), and both do a superb job of keeping pace with the venerable titan of Tinseltown.What's particularly effective here is the excellent use of setting. In Nightmute (sounds inviting, huh?), because of its far-northern location, the sun doesn't set for long periods of time. This causes Detective Dormer (Pacino) to eventually start falling apart at the seams, as the sun seems to penetrate every effort he makes to lose himself in restful slumber. This naturally ties into a specific subtext that reveals much about Dormer's personality and tainted past as a detective, and it's very refreshing to see the usual them of darkness giving way to light flipped on its head.The problem with writing a review of Insomnia is that I can't detail too much about what unfolds (in terms of plot) without ruining some of the major twists that lend genuine weight to the story as it ambles along some truly dark and disturbing corridors. Don't let the analogy fool you, though; there's nothing slow about the pacing, and it's wholly engrossing from start to finish. The sense of impending slumber is imminent, though, and this heightens the tension in the third act when 'truth' starts to become a relative term for our exhausted protagonist.Insomnia isn't nearly as stylish as Nolan's most recent offerings, but it's certainly ably directed and its tale is spun with maximum efficiency. If, for one reason or another, this gem that originally shone almost a decade ago has eluded your radar, be sure to check it out.As for myself, it's time to get a little shut-eye.",9,2,3,29 December 2012
500 Days of Summer," It's entertaining and thoughtful, a combination that's extraordinarily rare in the rom-coms I've encountered thus far in 2009.
","I have hope for the romantic comedy. After enduring February's He's Just Not That Into You, I really started to believe that the future for this particular genre, in terms of any sort of artistic appeal or entries that have any weight to them at all, was dismal. There have been some notable offerings over the last year or so in the form of some energetic indie films, but nothing to write home about.But then comes along first-time director Marc Webb with an enjoyable little number that has, at least for the time being, restored my faith in the rom-com. Remember the bliss that was Garden State? Think of (500) Days of Summer as a slightly more mature, infinitely more whimsical relative of the 2004 Zach Braff hit.The story follows the exploits of Tom Hansen, a twenty-something who grew up with rock-solid faith in the promise that there is such a thing as true love and that it's waiting for that perfect moment to manifest itself in our lives. He works as a writer for a greeting card company: you know, the ones that turn out the same 'Hang in there!' drivel you often find at your local Hallmark. Things are mediocre as usual until the day Tom's boss hires Summer Finn as an assistant. Tom is instantly mesmerized by her, and does all he can to catch her attention.The cat and mouse game that results is well crafted, funny, and true to life. Though things start to tire slightly at the conclusion, witnessing the evolution of the relationship between Tom and Summer is a real treat, and it shows that screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber have a real eye for the nuanced interactions that comprise the modern relationship for many people. The whole thing is intermittently narrated (literally and figuratively) too, which helps provide a decidedly 'fairy tale'-esque panache that both delivers on the promises we're fed during childhood and dashes them by deftly exploring the not- so-pretty harshness of how relationships often play out in the real world. All of this is nicely underscored by the fact that both Tom and Summer's parents are divorced–a key point that plays into their own expectations regarding relationships (particularly Summer's). This is made especially clear in a scene during which Tom and Summer purposely become lost in the maze that comprises their local Ikea. The pair jokingly takes on the stereotypical roles expected of a man and wife, with Summer cheerfully removing imaginary food from an oven and Tom sitting at a spotless kitchen table. He beams with an over-the-top smile, feigning pride in regards to the 'mock life' that him and his partner have fostered. There's some real subtextual resonance here, and it shows that everyone involved in (500) Days of Summer really wanted to create a film that goes beyond mere entertainment–they wanted to make something that their audience can relate to.There's also an artistic flair to the movie that makes it that much more interesting. Though it's rather infrequent, scenes sometimes transition into rough sketches mimicking those that Tom, who was schooled in architecture (though he chose not to pursue it as a career), pens in his notepad during his afternoon musings in a downtown Los Angeles park. The film even includes some cartoon animation, which shows Webb's ability to work some perfectly appropriate, albeit cheesy humor into the production. There are one or two instances where it seems as if (500) Days of Summer is 'being indie' just for the sake of being indie, but these are few and far between. They're also instantly forgivable in the midst of the accomplishments the film manages, especially considering the unrealistic convention that so many recent romantic comedies have fallen victim to.If you want an enjoyable night at the movies with your significant other, then go check out (500) Days of Summer. It's entertaining and thoughtful, a combination that's extraordinarily rare in the rom-coms I've encountered thus far in 2009.",9,1,1,26 December 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," Spielberg Strikes Again
","When I learned that Steven Spielberg was tackling the beloved TinTin comic strips so as to make a feature film faithful to the source material, I was admittedly indifferent. I didn't read these particular comics as a kid, and I wasn't a fan of the Polar Express gloss that (I imagined) would lend an unwelcome veneer to what could have been a lively action movie a-la Indiana Jones.I suppose I owe the venerable director an apology. The Adventures of Tintin thrives on its comic roots (as opposed to being hindered by them), and the seamless transition viewers are treated to finds our not- so-innocent hero—he is carrying a pistol, after all—globe-trotting between some truly spectacular action sequences that are directly reminiscent of Spielberg's actioners of old.The story we're presented with is a nifty little mixture of what I can only label a Holmes-esque detective story and a whip-crackin' adventure tale that—as many other critics have noted—takes some of its cues directly from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There are times where some of the action is a little too slapstick for my liking, but there's no getting around the fact that Spielberg once again showcases his bravado as a creator of ingenious thrill rides (the sort that, in my humble opinion, are often conspicuously absent in recent Hollywood fare).Where the movie stumbles is in its decision to have the rosy-cheeked Tintin dole out lessons on alcoholism to a blissfully out-of-touch sea captain who exists for little more than comic relief. In fact, there's a particularly awkward scene where our protagonist barks at his sidekick at the mention of alcohol, only to never revisit the issue (and, in fact, to completely ignore it until said captain symbolically kicks a bottle of whiskey over the side of a slick pier.This is small potatoes, though, because Tintin soars in almost every other aspect—in fact, one has to wonder if there's much more that Spielberg and company can do to perfect the formula that's made him the blockbuster mogul that he is.If you're looking for a family movie with some teeth, Tintin is just what the doctor ordered. That's a nice contrast to the usually gooey stuff that crops up during most holiday seasons, isn't it?",8,7,8,26 December 2012
The Expendables," Ka-Boom!
","Billed as a reunion of the most stellar action heroes of our age, The Expendables is uber-violent, uber-loud, and uber-stupid.We can't really fault Stallone and company though, can we? After all, these guys made their careers by starring in movies that are light on plot (with a few exceptions, of course) and heavy on ammunition/bone- breaking. Still, their previous efforts were, to a certain degree, effortlessly charming. With this most recent blow-em-up, the stars of the show—namely Stallone and Statham—do manage to bring some personality to an otherwise meat-headed testosterone-fest, but the feeling that it was made simply as a cash-grab to try and reel in fans of '80s action movies is undeniable.One could certainly argue that The Expendables is as cheesy as it is for a reason—I mean, what better way to pay homage to the often ridiculous, bullet-ridden actioners of yesteryear? Again, though, things here feel a little too forced, and the painfully stilted dialogue often elicits more unintended wincing than it does chuckles. There's also the sense that what we're witnessing is a tad bit I don't know sad. Like so many aging actors participating in revitalized franchises that ended decades ago, there's a somewhat clumsy 'last hurrah' tone that is, quite frankly, kind of depressing.None of this means the movie is a total flop, however. As was demonstrated in Rambo's most recent reincarnation, Stallone has a knack for crafting some of the most over-the-top (i.e., gory) deaths that have come along in quite a while. It's nice to see an action film maintain an unapologetic demeanor from start to finish, and this is something that a good portion of the choppy, fast-editing directors of contemporary Hollywood could learn from.Despite its successes, the sheer idiocy of the story dulls the welcome edge The Expendables is able to forge. So, instead of a well-made homage, we get a movie that's more 'decorative shell' than 'gutsy innards.'Kind of ironic, isn't it?",5,0,1,26 December 2012
21 Jump Street," Undercover Brothers
","Who would have thought that Channing Tatum would be able to go toe-to- toe with one of the poster-boys of the comedic renaissance? Not I. Imagine my surprise, then, when the chiseled actor whose usual fare is penned by none other than the gloopy Mr. Sparks exhibits just the sort of deadpan snark that Jonah Hill is known for with expert craftsmanship. In fact, the pairing makes for one of the more memorable comic duos of the past several years, ranking up there with the Seth Rogen / James Franco collaboration that gave us Pineapple Express.The story is a rehash of an earlier picture starring Johnny Depp. Two young police officers are selected for an undercover operation at a high school. They're tasked with unhinging the distribution of a narcotic that often finds its users in the morgue. As the plot thickens, we see two individuals who occupied opposite ends of the spectrum during their first foray into the world of high school—one an uber cool jock, the other a nerd who's as socially awkward as he is smart—attempting to deal with the shifting roles that finds them embodying the other's niche in unexpected ways. In this way, 21 Jump Street is a 'buddy cop' movie. This is great in that it reinvents many of the conventions of a fairly narrow genre, but it's also a detriment in that you know (for the most part) exactly what's going to happen by the end of the movie.The unexpected humor is what makes the movie a standout, though. It's worth your time to see these two 'bad boy' wannabees reference a variety of films as they fumble their way through the hormone drenched halls of a stereotypical high school while gunning down drug dealers and upending the clichés of the genre with appropriate nonchalance. Though there are times where the gratuitousness feels a tad bit unnecessary, it's funny in that cringing-because-we-can't-believe-they-actually-went-there-sort- of-way. The fact that the two leading men are able to elicit laughs while sending up a multitude of well-known action flicks is admirable, and there's no doubt that anyone willing to give Tatum a chance as he embodies an atypical role will not be disappointed.",8,1,2,26 December 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," I'm Giving Her All She's Got, Captain!
","As I've noted in other criticisms of comic-book themed feature films, superheroes have got it rough these days. With competition from the likes of The Dark Knight and Iron Man, it's not easy to distinguish oneself as a stand alone enterprise that paves its own way in the world of masks, capes and super-human abilities.That being said, it should come as no surprise that Captain America was an inevitability. With the recent success of Thor (and a variety of other films that aim to tie together The Avengers series into one 'super' movie), it was only a matter of time before we were thrust back to World War II and the exploits of the runt-turned-muscle-man protagonist that wields a shield made of the rarest metal on Earth (I forget the name, but, honestly, does it really matter?).Because of the pro-democracy propaganda inherent in the story, I initially identified Captain America as a film with a lot of promise. Early on, the movie makes good on that potential. There are some noteworthy instances that find our newly-fashioned American savior being reduced to a gaudy sideshow whose sole purpose is to sell war bonds. When this sort of real world commentary is effectively interwoven into the story is when Captain America tends to work best. In these instances, there's the sense that the writers have shirked any desire to follow the stereotypical comic book pastiche and have aimed for something much deeper (and, perhaps, more important).Unfortunately, these moments are few and far between. After the first half hour Captain America digresses into an explosion-heavy shoot-em-up that finds Hugo Weaving assuming the role of a ridiculously over-the-top Nazi scientist who has inexplicably transformed into a power-hungry mutant with a red face (and no nose). Things go from barely-likable-B- movie to unbearable garbage in about 2.5 seconds, and the conclusion is equally as tedious, resulting in more eye-rolling than any film I can remember in recent memory. What's especially nauseating about all of this is watching an actor with the chops of Tommy Lee Jones bumble around a CGI-laden environment with utter indifference.For one reason or another, a lot of people seemed to be saying 'O' Captain, My Captain'' upon the movie's theatrical release. I'm not sure why that is, as the whole production winds up being little more than a numbingly stupid action flick. In the end, it's the missed opportunities regarding the historical implications of a character like Captain America that sting the most.",3,4,8,26 December 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," It Doesn't Exactly Cast a Spell
","'Harry! Hermione! Ron!'I joked with some friends on the way to the theater that the preceding utterances would likely sum up the bulk of the dialogue in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. You see, with the exception of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the feature films that have sought to transform J.K. Rowling's vision of witchcraft and wizardry into a viable cinematic franchise have been—in my estimation—dry, predictable, and not all that engaging. Here, where we experience 'the beginning of the end,' it's clear that director David Yates was able to harness some of the energy and urgency that fueled his previous offering. 'Some,' of course, is the key word. Though the movie is book-ended by some admirably crafted action sequences that effectively immerse us in the far-flung world of wands, potions and evil lords, the middle sags, as Langston Hughes would say, 'like a heavy load.'Our protagonists' interactions have become increasingly complex as they've aged, and that's pushed to the next level in Deathly Hallows. No longer are Harry and company holding hands and exchanging superficial banter with those of the opposite sex: here, we see our hero exude confidence (and, perhaps, maturity) as he goes straight for a kiss right from the get-go. In fact, sexual tension courses through nearly every scene of the production. There's even an odd occurrence where we witness the feigned lustful encounter of some familiar characters via a mysterious vapor.Given their age, this isn't all that surprising, and it ultimately adds some believability to the maturation unfolding before us. On the flip side, this also means that we're exposed to a number of drawn-out sequences that seem more like forced characterization rather than anything truly genuine.And this is where the problems begin for Deathly Hallows. After a grand opening, we're forced to endure an hour (or so) of watching moody teenagers meander through the wilderness. They're searching for horcruxes—these objects are the key to defeating Voldemort (I think)—and the location and purpose of each one is shrouded in mystery (surprise!).Naturally, it takes a lot of interviewing and pondering for the necessary revelations to take place, but they eventually do, and we're treated to a third act that's vastly more entertaining than anything that comes before.A few other notes: hints of Lord of the Rings abound, especially when a horcrux on a chain acts as a burden for each of our protagonists. Just as we've seen with the 'one ring' in Middle Earth, this item brings out the worst in its bearer. And, as one of my students noted in a recent essay submission, there are some blatant comparisons made between Lord Voldemort to Adolf Hitler (and subsequently Nazi Germany). I don't necessarily mind this, but anyone familiar with popular culture or world history might find the preaching of Rowling a little heavy-handed.As stated in my review of Half-Blood Prince, I have not read any of the novels. I'm told that much of what we see in Deathly Hallows is important to further fleshing out our heroic trio, and I'm willing to chalk up what I can only describe as 'tedium' to screenwriter Steve Kloves desire to remain faithful to the source material.But the question remains: for this to be the start of a slam-bang finish, couldn't something have been done to make it a little more I don't know magical?",6,2,2,27 December 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Admirably Spun
","When it was announced that a Spidey reboot was in the works, most people responded in the same way (namely, by groaning and emphasizing their contempt for Hollywood and it's lack of originality). Likewise, I thought it completely unnecessary to start from scratch, as Sam Raimi and company had crafted an admirable trilogy (the third installment being a take-it-or-leave it experience). With The Dark Knight Rises on the horizon and The Avengers having ruled the first half of the summer movie season, it seemed as if Marc Webb had accepted a fool's errand in attempting to spin a tale that, by all accounts, didn't need to be retold.Lo and behold The Amazing Spider-Man, an origins tale that's a much darker, more brooding take than its 2002 counterpart. This time around, Peter Parker is played by Andrew Garfield. Unlike Mr. Maguire, this Parker has a tangible chip on his shoulder. He's a moody teen who vividly recalls the day his parents dropped him off at Aunt May and Uncle Ben's so his scientific genius father could sort out a mysterious mess at Oscorp, only to never return. Peter has inherited his father's knack for figuring out how things work—albeit in a more mechanical sense —and, though introverted, is clearly a clever kid in his own right. As new insights about his dad's work come to light, Parker finds himself in the labs of the fabled biogenetics lab that his old man helped build. It's then that he is—wait for it!—bitten by a mutated spider.As you can see, the basic layout of The Amazing Spider-Man is very similar to what transpires in Raimi's feature. One key difference, however, is the decision to focus on Peter's father. This helps motivate Peter to embark on a quest to discover 'who he is,' which ultimately leads him to the realization that his dad's intentions were noble. Another significant difference here is the tone; Webb and Garfield remove the slapstick comedy that made the original (the 2002 original, that is) a colorful, light-hearted affair. In its place is a decidedly more drab depiction of the Big Apple and its inhabitants, and— for my money, at least—a more compelling vision of how Parker comes into his own as the web-slinging hero of yore.So, even though there are plenty of familiar elements, the movie feels like a more mature take on Spidey that causal moviegoers and more ardent web-heads can both admire and appreciate.",8,35,56,26 December 2012
The Exorcist," Essential Horror
","I have a dirty little confession to make—I never actually saw The Exorcist in its entirety until one week ago. Taking this long to see what many consider to be the horror movie to end all horror movies is a travesty; trust me, I know. Over the years I had caught bits and pieces of it on television, but for some reason I just never took the time out of my oh-so-busy schedule to sit down and watch the whole thing from start to finish.After making a hasty decision to watch it very late one night via my Netflix Instant Queue, I found that all of the hearsay surrounding this 1973 classic is true. It's extraordinarily creepy, unsettling, and well done.Max von Sydow plays Father Merrin, a Catholic priest who moonlights as an archaeologist. It turns out that he's also one of the foremost experts on possessions and exorcisms.When Reagan, the daughter of a wealthy actress who resides in Washington D.C., is possessed by an evil spirit that claims to be none other than Satan himself, a long and winding road develops that will eventually lead a weathered old priest and a demon-possessed child to a meeting that is nothing short of bone- chilling. I'm getting a little ahead of myself, though, so let's back things up.Reagan, a 12 year-old who lives with her mother in a Georgetown area townhouse, gradually begins to exhibit increasingly erratic (and wholly bizarre) behavior. Her mother, Chris MacNeil (played by Ellen Burstyn), consults a large variety of medical professionals to try and determine what's causing the strange outbursts—which, by the way, entail sporadically cursing God and inflicting brutal physical damage on herself and others.Part of what makes The Exorcist work so well is the realistic handling of this situation by Chris (she immediately contacts a wide variety of medical professionals). Very few people would immediately think, 'Okay— my daughter is possessed' and consult religious authorities as a primary reaction. The doctors who try to treat Reagan all approach this from a very scientific, logos-oriented standpoint too; their initial diagnosis is that she has a legion on her brain that's causing the erratic and violent behavior. After undergoing a series of gruesome tests to try and identify the location of said elusive legion, the doctors find that, physiologically, she's in full working order. Frustrated and baffled at the lack of competence these physicians have displayed, Chris starts to enter panic mode. Reluctantly, one doctor eventually suggests that Reagan is the victim of supernatural influences, and, as a last resort, Chris gets in touch with a local priest by the name of Father Karras. Karras is a well-educated man who is immediately skeptical of the supposed possession of Reagan, but he agrees to visit her and assess the situation himself. After a series of harrowing encounters with demon- Reagan, Karras, with the blessing of the Catholic church, teams up with Merrin in an attempt to drive away the evil spirit.The plot, as you've no doubt noticed, is pretty bare bones, but, like any truly scary tale regarding the paranormal, it works because it's handled with thoughtfulness and sincerity. All of the actors display a true sense of urgency in regards to the seriousness of Reagan's situation, and the acting of Blair (who, of course, was only a child at the time) is phenomenal. As Father Karras repeatedly visits and tries to learn more about who (or what) has taken over Reagan, said evil influence begins to bore into Karras' mind. Slowly, it's revealed that Karras is plagued with guilt in regards to his recently deceased mother. She passed away after he made the decision to place her in a nursing home, and Satan (or whoever is in Reagan) methodically mines that guilt until Karras is on the verge of completely losing it. The psychological horror utilized in The Exorcist is supremely scary, and this, along with many other things, helps elevate it above any other 'possession' movie that's ever been made.Added to the effect of this is the fact that The Exorcist builds tension better than almost any other horror movie. As people approach the door to Reagan's bedroom, the sense of foreboding terror that lurks just beyond what you can see is palpable—you'll literally find the hair standing up on the back of your neck as you're pleading for whichever character to just hurry up and throw the door open so you'll be able to breathe again.And, of course, The Exorcist has many scenes that exist for no other reason than to totally freak you out. The head-turn sequence comes to mind first, and is closely followed by the stomach-turning pea soup vomit scene and the crab-walk-down-the-stairs bit that's found in the director's cut.I feel immensely guilty myself for not having scene this until the ripe old age of 27. If you consider yourself a horror aficionado and have never seen it, then go out and rent it right now—just be prepared to keep a crucifix and a vial of holy water next to your bed after you've developed a legitimate fear of the thumping sound coming from your attic.",10,4,6,26 December 2012
District 9," See it. Now.
","District 9 probably isn't what you think it is. If you've seen any of the trailers or recent TV spots for the film, one might expect that it's a slightly more intelligent version of Independence Day. Ominous shots of an alien mother ship hovering above Johannesburg have no doubt fueled speculation that this Neill Blomkamp/Peter Jackson collaboration is a movie that's strangely 'arthouse' in its aspirations, which are awkwardly offset by the inclusion of what appears to be a fair amount of mainstream Hollywood-type alien/human warfare. Forget all that. It's a piece of cinema that's not flawless, but it's very close–it's a movie I could talk about all day, but it's something that you need to experience to truly appreciate.If you want my thesis, though, here it is: District 9 is an alien epic that's simultaneously exhilarating and affecting. Even though it occasionally surrenders to certain filmmaking and storytelling clichés, this is a must-see film for any fan of science fiction, and it's commentary on racism, prejudice, and the inherent violence found in all organic beings makes it, in a few brief, gut-wrenching moments, as thought-provoking as anything else out there.The aliens in this movie, known as 'prawns,' were extracted from their ship by humans after it came to Earth and showed no signs of activity, floating quietly over South Africa, for a long period of time. It turns out that the prawn were malnourished, stranded, and didn't have anywhere else to go. Because of their large numbers (somewhere on the order of 1.5 million), it was decided that they be kept in a restricted area known as District 9 for their own well being.During an attempt to relocate the prawn, our protagonist, Wikus Van De Merwe, an employee of an organization titled Multi-National United (MNU), is accidentally sprayed in the face with a prawn biochemical. Soon, he starts having a really bad day (in true Peter Jackson fashion, I might add, that's directly reminiscent of one of his especially gory features–the classic Dead Alive). Before long, it's clear that the MNU has a more sinister motive for keeping the prawn in captivity, and the whole thing essentially becomes one long chase film (albeit a wonderfully crafted one).When the movie begins, the story unfolds in the form of a documentary, but, as the action is amped up, Blomkamp opts for the more traditional method of directing, and we're allowed to see things that could never be revealed via documentary. On the whole I think the decision to shift the mode the story is told in is a good one, but there are times where, in the middle of the action, the perspective reverts back to that of a documentary. When this happens, it often seems as if it's done for a sense of continuity–it doesn't really add anything to the story itself, and seems to be more of a stylistic decision. I suppose this is a minor gripe, but it can be a little distracting. I think the movie would've benefited from having a contained documentary placed exclusively at the beginning that explains the origin of the prawn–the random switch-back to the 'security camera/handycam' view, especially in the heat of the action, could interrupt the trance District 9 will undoubtedly have you in. There are also one or two 'Hollywood' moments that may have you rolling your eyes–especially when they're in stark contrast with the realism found at the beginning of the movie–but the story is so cleverly constructed and the transition into a more traditional mode of storytelling is so subtle that it ultimately shouldn't hinder most people's enjoyment of District 9. In fact, it will make a movie that could've been alienating–please forgive the horrible pun–accessible for a wider audience that might otherwise be put-off by the unusual approach Blomkamp initially takes in terms of telling this particular story.In light of all that District 9 accomplishes, the minor flaws I've just referenced almost completely disappear. The attention to detail, for example, in the movie is staggering; everything from the prawn technology (you can see the moving parts in each and every weapon) to the strikingly human emotion incorporated into the beautifully rendered CGI creatures will mesmerize you. Blend this with some strong acting from Sharlto Copley and the universal theme of bigotry (and how it's handled) and you'll see why many critics have praised this as the best piece of sci-fi to come along in quite some time.So, despite my nitpicking, I absolutely loved this movie. It's an almost flawless piece of sci-fi cinema–it's emotionally engaging, thought provoking, and is filled with original, jaw-dropping technology and action. I want so badly to comment on how much I loved the ending, too, and what it suggestsbut I won't do that because I would be doing District 9 a severe disservice. The only way to appreciate this movie is to get out of your chair and go see it. Now.",9,2,4,26 December 2012
Bridesmaids," Love Hurts
","Let's be honest: when we saw the first trailer for Bridesmaids, who among us didn't think it looked like a dismal rehash of The Hangover (only this one, of course, features a 'ratpack' of women)? Imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered that Bridesmaids is better than The Hangover. I have yet to see The Hangover Part 2, so I can't comment on any similarities/differences that might or might not exist. But one thing is for sure: Kristen Wiig has proved her worth as a female lead with a serious amount of comedic clout.The story isn't revolutionary: one of two best friends is getting married, and everything involved with said nuptials is threatening to tear their lifelong friendship apart. At the center of this battle is Helen, a newly acquired 'friend'—via the merging of two exclusive social circles—who begins taking over the wedding plans for Lillian (Rudolph). Annie (Wiig) makes it her mission to take out this she-devil, and what follows is the setup for one of the more memorable meltdowns (among a plethora of other things) to come along in quite some time. Bridesmaids is also peppered with the sort of humor that made movies like Superbad and Knocked Up so funny—it's observant and kitschy in that it rightly jabs several other films that have braved similar issues. In fact, the previously mentioned Hangover is, in at least a very minute way, one of these movies. In what initially appears to be a sad 'bow' to The Hangover as king of the pre-wedding funnies, the girls decide to go to Vegas for Lillian's bachelorette party. This ends up being a perfectly welcome curve ball, though, as screenwriters Wiig and Mumolo brilliantly utilize the length of the plane trip to said destination to further flesh out their characters and create an impressively humorous string of in-flight mishaps.There are a number of other contributors who make Bridesmaids work extraordinarily well, but, as is the case with any solid piece of cinema, it's best if you set aside some time to take in the whole thing in one fell swoop and let it unravel of its own volition. Sure, it's extraordinarily raunchy from time to time, but the nuanced, perfectly- timed moments of comedic genius make it a very worthwhile trip.",8,25,47,26 December 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," More of the Same?
","I'll be honest; though I greatly enjoyed the Lord of the Rings movies upon their release, they never really enveloped me in quite the same way that the original Star Wars or, say, Back to the Future trilogies did. When the announcement came that The Hobbit would also be receiving the Jackson treatment, I was excited for one specific reason: I absolutely loved the book. It's a relatively brief experience, one in which I presumed the now well-known director would be able to spin into one helluva knock-out return to Middle-earth. Imagine my shock when I learned that the book would not be made into a single film. In fact, it wouldn't even be split into two; instead, three was the magic number. Because of this, my excitement about The Hobbit quickly waned, as it seemed that I was in for an unnecessarily prolonged cash-grab that had the potential to (very) quickly outstay its welcome.Thankfully, The Hobbit isn't nearly as tedious as it could have been. From time to time, the feeling that things are being stretched a little thin is tangible, but, for the most part, it's a stirring, gripping adventure. The movie also does a nice job of connecting itself to its predecessors (or should I say forebearers?), and the introduction of the principal players is both whimsical and wrought with a sense of impending danger—something that adds needed weight to stakes that we, as an audience, know will ultimately be resolved (this, I think, is the primary curse of prequel feature films).Any other criticisms that I have come in the form of many of the movie's more intense moments and how they're worked out. My memory is hazy regarding the film's source material, but many pages were clearly taken out of the LotR playbook when it seems 'all hope is lost,' and though this sort of reminiscence will certainly bring a smile to the faces of fans, it would have been nice to see the movie do something a little more aggressive to try and separate itself from the original series.It's clear, however, that Jackson still loves Middle-earth and its inhabitants, and it's a virtual certainty that the remaining films will be welcome excursions. Here's hoping that part two of this particular adventure will be both tightly wrought and surprising in equal measure.",8,2,8,29 December 2012
28 Days Later...," The End is Nigh...
","The first time I saw 28 Days Later was at a special on-campus screening when I was still in college. I remember watching one or two teaser trailers before leaving my cramped dorm room and thinking, 'Oh—another zombie movie.' It turns out my hasty assessment of Danny Boyle's gritty tale of horror and sociopolitical intrigue was grossly inaccurate, as this is so much more than just 'another zombie movie' (and really, if you want to get technical, I wouldn't classify it as a zombie movie, because the overly-aggressive beings are, after all, not dead).The film opens with a group of animal rights activists breaking into a British research facility designed to study primates. Viewers are only given hazy clues as to why the sole lab technician in the building adamantly cautions the activists that they're making a huge mistake by releasing the animals (because 'they've been given an inhibitor' that's somehow designed to presumably eradicate violent behavior in humans), but they fail to heed his warnings. When one of the freed chimps lunges at and bites an activist, she instantly becomes ill. Within seconds her eyes have turned red, and she's hissing, snarling, and vomiting blood. She's just been infected with the RAGE virus.Cut to—you guessed it—28 days later and our protagonist, Jim, is just waking up from a stay in the hospital. He was sideswiped by a car while delivering a package somewhere in London, and has been knocked out ever since. As he confusedly wanders out of the abandoned hospital, he discovers that there is nobody around—anywhere. One of the largest cities on earth is literally a ghost town. I don't want to ruin some of the great scares that are associated with the opening sequence(s), but rest assured that this movie is smart, well-acted (and directed), and utterly horrifying.28 Days Later had an almost immediate impact on me. Call it a heightened sense of paranoia in the wake of 9/11, but the idea of a biological attack incapacitating and ultimately killing millions of people is, at least in my mind, not all that far-fetched. Though it's certainly exaggerated here for the purposes of generating effective horror, this movie feels real. The attention paid to details it what gives it weight (as is the case with so many movies), and when we see Jim running in terror from a pack of aggressive 'infected' who want nothing more than to spray blood on him and thus spread the virus, it's a chilling spectacle.And that, perhaps, is what makes 28 Days Later so effective. It all comes down to the very notion that should something like this happen, there would be absolutely no escape. There's no bargaining with those who are infected—they can no longer think for themselves; they're actions are involuntary, and are the direct result of being stimulated by bright lights or (and this is pure speculation because a clear explanation for their behavior is never given) the scent of those who are still uninfected.This taken on it's own would be enough to sustain an incredibly scary piece of horror cinema, but Danny Boyle decides to throw viewers a curve ball in the final act of the film. Like so many other horror classics, the term 'monster' becomes loosely defined as people consistently demonstrate the seemingly innate ability to fend for themselves, no matter what. And, of course, the only way to beat fire is with fire. All of this sounds ambiguous I'm sure, but it'll make sense once you watch the movie, and it gives the conclusion of the film a certain subtext that might not have otherwise been present.The very name of the virus (RAGE) says something about Danny Boyle's intentions with making this film, and it clearly reveals something about Man; something that, as several of the characters assert, has been proved to be true time and again. 28 Days Later is scary enough as a no-escape exercise in aggressive 'zombie' horror, but it's elevated to modern classic status by its unsettling observations concerning the true nature of humanity.",10,1,3,26 December 2012
Django Unchained," Quentin Strikes Again
","Tarantino's most recent offering, Inglorious Basterds, made a statement that his previous works—in many ways—did not: namely, that the man has matured as a filmmaker. Though there's no doubt that the likes of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and the like are modern classics of popular culture, they didn't necessarily demonstrate a more refined sense of wellresponsibility. With Django Unchained, the writer/director has crafted a piece of storytelling that's both violent and poignant; here, though, the violence isn't glorified in quite the same way it has been in the past.The year is 1858—'Two Years Before the Civil War' as the opening titles tell us—and the slavery-plantation infrastructure is at the height of its dominance in the southern U.S. Also woven into this backdrop is the prominence of bounty hunters; individuals contracted by U.S. Marshals to apprehend—dead or alive—outlaws who quickly ventured out of their respective jurisdictions. One such mercenary is the German-born Dr. King Schultz (Waltz). He possesses a refined viciousness, but he makes no bones about his contempt for slavery. In an attempt to locate a trio of bandits that have changed names and relocated to another part of the country, Schultz enlists the help of Django (Foxx), a slave who has seen the gang in person and can identify them on sight. We quickly learn that there's more to Django than meets the eye. The man was separated from his wive via the slave trade some time prior, and will do anything and everything to free her. Thus the two enter into a partnership which sees them carving a path of carnage through each of the slave states between Texas and Tennessee.It's a relatively straightforward tale of love and revenge (really, are Tarantino movies ever anything else?), and blood is spilled by the gallon every time a bullet is sent flying through an unsuspecting foe. As previously mentioned, however, there's the pressing message that violence begets violence; an especially brutal scene sees a runaway slave get ripped apart by a pack of ravenous dogs. As the grisly scenario plays out, Schultz shies away in disgust, visibly shaken by the spectacle. In fact, he's haunted by this for the remainder of the film, and it greatly influences his actions near the climax. This, I think, is where Django works best; though nauseating, it's clear that Tarantino and company were determined to foster an accurate sense of how horrific the atrocities of slavery really were. And when it comes to airbrushing history, it's clear that Tarantino absolutely refuses to tone things down.The stylistic flair that's defined virtually every Tarantino outing is present here too, and it distinguishes the film in much the same way. Unusual—and humorous—music is cued at just the right moment, and the dialogue is every bit as crisp as you'd expect.The acting is spectacular as well. Of particular note is the portrayal of Calvin Candie (DiCaprio). Candie is the owner of 'Candie Land,' one of the most feared plantations in the country, and the final destination of our protagonists as they work through their bounties in an effort to reunite Django with his betrothed. Candie is a ruthless slave owner who has an incendiary desire to inflict suffering on the residents of his property, and there's a subdued brand of rage that DiCaprio is able to bring to the role. Waltz and Foxx are, of course, formidable actors, but DiCaprio steals the show in the latter half of the movie, and, like Waltz in Basterds, he becomes the villain that we love to hate. Samuel L. Jackson is also memorable as Steven, the right-hand man (and long time slave) of Candie.If I have any criticisms of the movie it comes in the form of the revenge bits. Though completely expected, there's an early perception that Django and Schultz are both burdened by the sense that so much killing will result in a continually growing burden that will eventually accumulate into something entirely crushing. Having these characters attempt to hash this out would have been a welcome addition; in my mind, it would have been something that separated the film from all of Tarantino's previous movies. It would have demonstrated an even deeper sense of maturity than any of us would have expected. In many ways, I kept waiting for Tarantino to transcend—for lack of a better word— himself. This never truly happens, and it's a tad bit disappointing.That said, Django Unchained delivers in virtually every way. It's well- written, brilliantly directed, engrossing, and, (perhaps) most importantly, laced with moments of welcome seriousness.",9,3,12,26 December 2012
Drive," Don't Mess With Stuntmen
","Drive is a movie that's been on my radar for quite some time (especially after it showed up seemingly out of nowhere and garnered almost universal critical praise). After a colleague mentioned in passing that it was unexpectedly dark and well worth a look-see, I set aside 100 minutes this past Wednesday night to finally see what all the fuss is about.The movie follows an enigmatic figure known only as 'Driver.' He's a mechanic and Hollywood stuntman who spends his nights as a wheelman for people pulling burglaries. He's quiet and, aside from the death-defying nature of both his day and night jobs, doesn't seem to have much of a 'normal' life. He doesn't have any friends—apart from the gnarled shop owner who hired him some years prior—and seems consistently lost in thought. When he speaks, everyone listens (including viewers), because there's something magnetic about his persona. This is due to Gosling's impeccable depiction of an apparently tortured protagonist—I say 'apparently' because even though we don't get any real back story it's clear that said Driver is constantly trying to overcome his own demons— and the crisp writing and direction. Things progress deliberately (which doesn't necessarily mean slowly), and each frame is saturated with emotional resonance.Much to my surprise, Drive is, at its heart, a crime drama. The plot is fueled by an east coast/west coast mob fiasco that's directly related to a botched robbery attempt our Driver was involved in. There were moments where this nebulous MacGuffin felt a little cliché (echoes of a A History of Violence abound), but make no mistake: the tension is tangible from start to finish. In fact, I can't remember a recent offering within this genre was so methodical while also managing to foster a never wavering sense of dread that something horrendous was just around the corner (okay, maybe The Departed fits the bill, but you get the point).Drive is like an otherwise perfect piece of fruit with a few minor imperfections. And like the bruised pear these are easily pared away, and what's left is one of the more engrossing crime-action thrillers of the past decade. Be sure to check it out.",8,4,5,26 December 2012
2012," Apocalypse Anyone
","If I had to select one person to crown the undisputed king of the disaster movie, it'd have to be Roland Emmerich. With such films as Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow under his belt, not many can go toe-to-toe with the German king of CGI. While I'll be the first to admit that I've got a little bit of a soft spot for his 1996 alien invasion blockbuster, I really didn't like his 2004 treatise on global warming (which, in one particularly harrowing scene, had its protagonists running from an advancing cold front). In any case, here is Mr. Emmerich testing his destructive know-how once again, trying desperately, I'm sure, to salvage any semblance of a reputation he has in the wake of the atrocious 10,000 B.C.John Cusack (playing the role of Jackson Curtis) takes the lead in this latest effort. He's an aspiring author—to be fair, his first novel had 450+ copies published, so 'aspiring' might not be the right word—whose day job is that of a limousine driver. When he's not shuttling wealthy Russians to and from LAX, he devotes his time to his children. This is where things get sticky, though, because Jackson is divorced; his wife, Kate, is now dating a yuppie plastic surgeon (Gordon) and his kids think this guy is, well just tops. So, one weekend Jackson decides to take his young-uns to Yellowstone National Park for a little father-children time. What he didn't expect on this trip was to run into a conspiracy theorist (Charlie Frost, played by Woody Harrelson) who broadcasts a radio show from his Winnebago. This guy is a real nut job who spends his time mourning the state of the U.S. government and predicting the end of the world, which, according to him—and, of course, the Mayans— will occur on December 21, 2012.Still with me? Good. Let's take a look at the story we've been presented with so far: a fairly level-headed man who's trying to hold his family together—and who has absolutely no background in science (or any reason to be interested in it whatsoever)—has had a strange encounter with a hippie living in an RV full of shoddy evidence to support a theory about the end of the world. Reason would suggest that Jackson would dismiss this man's ramblings as the byproduct of a strained psychosis, right? And, in fact, that's exactly what he does the first time he runs into Charlie. Not fifteen minutes later, however, he witnesses a fault line rip through a Los Angeles area grocery store on TV and he's lapping up this guy's commentary with a spoon. The instant turn around in his opinion of Charlie is shocking, and it's painfully obvious that it's nothing more than a plot device instituted to speed up the Biblical destruction we've paid so dearly to see.Honestly, I wouldn't normally think this is a bad thing. I knew going into this one that suspension of intelligent thought was a prerequisite; Emmerich knows this too, and, for whatever reason, he decides to test his audience's patience by stacking one ridiculous scenario on top of another. In a Crash-like convergence of fate, eventually a sea of characters (with their own plots and subplots) come together in completely unbelievable ways. On top of all this is a syrupy coating of sentimentality that feels out of place (and, at times, just plain embarrassing). Patrons are paying to see mountains topple and familiar monuments crumble in a maelstrom of fiery, bass-heavy destruction. We go to 2012 because we wanted to be beaten silly by unchecked chaos. What we don't want from these characters—who repeatedly worm their way out of impossible situations—are forced emotions.Static characters are given minimal backstory and then thrown into situations that are specifically designed to manipulate our pathos; which, by the way, just about all of us—whether we're aware of it or not —decided to check at the door. How many times can audiences tear up at the sight of family members embracing one another in the shadow of a mile-high tsunami? It worked surprisingly well in Deep Impact, for example, but, at this point in the history of disaster movies, it's a played out tactic. Really, it comes across as incredibly insulting.But what about the computer-generated bedlam? Is it as good as the teasers indicate? I'm here to tell you that it's vicious and unrelenting. This is great, but there's one problem; it's predictable. You'll find yourself actually becoming bored as plane after plane barely rises above a crumbling runway. Employing a little creativity in the disaster scenario department, it seems, could've done wonders for a film whose sole job is to 'wow' us with multimillion dollar effects. Though there are some memorable bits here, they're far from mind-blowing. In fact, we've seen pretty much all of it before, and often done in better ways.Where 2012 falters most is in its lack of urgency. Since this is the end of the world, you'd think that we, as viewers, would have the nagging sense that there's a lot at stake. Any chance the movie had of generating such feelings is instantly shattered, for example, when we see a fru-fru dog we couldn't care less about prancing across a high- wire as a dramatic score bombards us with what I'll generically label 'rising tension.'If 2012 pulls in the mass audience studio execs are banking on, maybe we can take it as a sign that the end of competent filmmaking is very, very near.",3,0,2,26 December 2012
The Hurt Locker," It Hurts So Good
","My favorite war movie of all time is Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg's gritty, unflinching depiction of World War II made audiences feel as if they were really on the front lines. This, paired with some truly substantial emotional heft and psychological underpinnings, makes it a film that is both haunting and unforgettable. I think it's safe to say that Kathryn Bigelow has taken a lot of cues from Spielberg, and that's a good thing.The Hurt Locker takes place in 2004. US Army Staff Sergeant Will James has just joined Bravo Company's bomb disposal unit, where he patrols the streets of Baghdad and makes it abundantly clear that everything they encounter is a potential threat. The paranoia here is justified, though, as seemingly innocent piles of rubble consistently turn out to be bombs with maniacally complex structures.As Will goes about his job, it's clear that he's a reckless adrenaline junkie–instead of sending a robot in to assess what are easily lethal situations, he prefers to do it himself. His penchant toward recklessness and danger is further enforced by the fact that he constantly chain smokes and occasionally indulges in the stereotypical drunken, macho horseplay. He also likes to unwind by listening to metal CDs as he examines the spare parts of bombs that almost killed him. While everyone else is counting down the days till they're rotation is up, Will is living for the danger of the moment.The Hurt Locker opens with a quote by Chris Hedges which suggests that war is a drug. This message is driven home for the entire 131 minute run time of the movie, and the imagery here leaves no doubt that the thrill of staring death in the face is what keeps Will going (his motivation to do this is made especially clear by the scenes preceding the film's conclusion). All of this is interesting, but it's something that's been depicted in movies many times before. For example, The Patriot and Full Metal Jacket have already demonstrated how people can have a disturbing 'give and take' relationship with war, which is exactly what Will has here. I'm not suggesting that this is a bad thing, but it does feel a little recycled.What's really interesting about The Hurt Locker (and what would've made it more unique in the end) are the technical details of what's involved with disarming these devices–and, of course, what life is like for these soldiers on a daily basis.It seems that The Hurt Locker is also trying to touch on the notion that violence embeds itself in those in close proximity to it, and that it's transfered to subsequent generations. This is something that's handled with just the right amount of ambiguity, and it does help add a little something to the story that would've otherwise been missing, so, overall, this is an added strength of the film (not to mention that it provides some incentive for repeated viewings).Where The Hurt Locker succeeds the most, however, is in its action scenes. Each of these finds Will taking on bombs or other unexpected threats, and they cause viewers to soon realize that, in this place, anything can happen. The Hurt Locker, for the most part, avoids Hollywood stereotypes, and isn't afraid to sacrifice characters for the sake of realism. These are some of the most intense moments you'll encounter at theater, and that alone makes it worth the arm and leg theaters are currently charging for admission.If you're looking for a change of pace in the form of a non-blockbuster, this is the way to go. While the message contained within The Hurt Locker is nothing new, it's still an intense and informative war movie that features top-notch performances.",8,0,1,27 December 2012
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Delicious
","Pixar is the undisputed king of the animated. According to tradition, no other studio is even able to hold a candle to the impeccably written/rendered masterpieces the Disney-affiliated atelier continues to churn out year after year. With the critical acclaim Dreamworks' How to Train Your Dragon has recently received, though, the previous is quickly becoming an antiquated notion. Recently, another brilliantly written (and directed) animated feature—which, for some inexplicable reason, somehow managed to drift under the radar of the popular eye—was released and serves as a great example of how the competition is heating up for the hitherto unchallenged Pixar. I present to you Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.The story follows a down-and-out inventor named Flint Lockwood. He lives with is dad and is considered 'the local crackpot.' Flint's hometown—which is situated on an island in the middle of the Atlantic— has fallen upon dire financial straits after its chief source of revenue (a sardine canning plant) closed its doors. Flint, however, has come up with a device that he believes will preserve the sanity of his fellow citizens, who, in addition to facing sever monetary problems, have been forced to consume the leftover sardines from the cannery. The nifty little contraption he's created converts water vapor to food. We're talking ice cream, spaghetti, pizza, chips, etc. When Flint attempts to hook his machine up to a more sufficient power source than he's afforded in his lab on stilts, things go haywire, and his food-maker is launched into the stratosphere. Before anyone knows what's happened, hamburgers begin falling from the sky. Flint soon realizes that he can broadcast a signal to his device and control the items it releases. Soon the entrepreneurial spirit of the town's mayor takes over, and greed becomes the order of the day.I know what you're thinking: this all sounds very familiar. WALL-E tackled similar themes, and it addressed them so beautifully that it seems like Meatballs couldn't possibly be anything more than an afterthought withering in Pixar's massive shadow. Surprisingly, this is very far from the truth. Don't make the mistake of dismissing this as 'more of the same': it's not. Actually, it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I'm saying this as an adult male who typically finds the comedy in animated features strained and flat. Here, I laughed out loud at regular intervals. The humor is subtle, nuanced, and often nothing short of riotous (parodying everything from viral videos to blockbuster action flicks).I don't think I can heap enough praise on the cleverly constructed story and the superbly timed comedy, so I'll drive my point home by saying that Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs will delight you in the most unexpected ways.In fact, you should go watch it. Right now.",9,1,3,26 December 2012
Clash of the Titans," It's all Greek to Me
","Let me get this out of the way first: I have not seen the original Clash of the Titans. Because of this, I'm—obviously—unable to compare this remake with the 1980′s flick that so many people have fond memories of. I must also explain why I chose to experience the latest vehicle for now Hollywood commodity Sam Worthington the old fashioned way (which, of course, would be within the realm of the two dimensional). Knowing that most 3D endeavors are typically laden with the worst sort of filmmaking gimmicks, I wanted to give this one the chance to 'wow' me without waving the tail of a giant scorpion in my face or having a larger-than- life Kracken tentacle bearing down on me as I inhaled popcorn.So, how does this over-the-top tale of Greek gods and mythical beasts fare? Really well, when one considers the fact that it was meant to be nothing more than a B-movie set in a long-forgotten world that plays within its own set of clearly defined rules.If someone enters Clash of the Titans expecting high art, then A) they haven't seen a single one of the previews for the film, B) they've watched any one of the Lord of the Rings movies one too many times or C) they've somehow managed to snuff out their inner child. What we get here is essentially a watered down version of the God of War video game series: the character of Perseus isn't nearly as well developed as the ash-covered anti-hero Kratos, but he's infinitely more likable.After watching his surrogate family perish at the hands of Hades, the demi-god (who's the son of Zeus) seeks revenge on the overly malicious god of the underworld. As he encounters the citizens of Argos—a town that's doomed because of it's blatant refusal to worship the inhabitants of Mt. Olympus—Perseus' motivations slowly shift toward the humane, and, after it's all said and done, he does emerge an enlightened protagonist. The word 'enlightened' should be taken with many grains of salt, though, as this is character development of the most barebones variety. Titans is a movie that, despite its gargantuan scope, is strangely episodic in nature. Depending on your expectations, this is either a good thing or a bad thing, but, given the implicit nature of the movie, I found it to be entirely appropriate.As one would imagine, this doesn't meant that Titans is entirely without fault. It does become a little tedious to watch Perseus hurl himself from one exotic/mysterious locale to another, and we hardly get to know any of his companions before they're impaled, dismembered, or turned to stone. And at 106 minutes, the movie feels like it ends prematurely (there's also the long-anticipated confrontation with the oft-alluded to 'monster of epic proportions,' which, like a number of other scenes, is over far too quickly).Still, this is a movie that's all about temporarily excusing reality and soaking up some beautifully crafted eye candy. In that regard, Clash of the Titans is just the sort of light-hearted fluff that most moviegoers are able to appreciate",6,1,2,26 December 2012
The Adjustment Bureau," Going in Circles
","In my mind, Philip K. Dick is pretty much the greatest science fiction author ever. From his pen we've received an onslaught of works that have been spun into classic movies: Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report are just a few examples. Recently, his story of an up- and-coming Senatorial candidate who finds himself the observer of men who carefully organize mankind's existence so that it pans out in very specific ways was released on Blu-ray/DVD. It's nicely directly and features some solid performances, but the screenplay is full of holes—so many, in fact, that it bears asking whether or not the thing was even finished when it ended up in the hands of director George Nolfi.As indicated, The Adjustment Bureau is—for the most part—science fiction. One might classify it as a fantasy, though elements of both are present. More than anything, though, it's a love story. When the previously mentioned politician is prevented from carrying out a relationship with a girl he bumped to after losing his most recent election bid, he does everything he can to defy the 'powers that be.' Our protagonist feels driven (by nothing more complex than deep-seeded love) to spend his life with a girl he'd met only once, even after he's informed that his 'plan' calls for him to assume much higher duties that don't involve said romantic interest (he is, in fact, scheduled to one day become President). Mr. Damon wants none of this, however, if he can't have the girl.And that's the plot. Damon's character darts around NYC, eluding obstacles placed along his route by the trench coat men of the enigmatic Bureau, occasionally exchanging dialogue with a rogue agent who believes the whole thing is a faulty endeavor. The philosophical and religious explorations related to free will are certainly thought-provoking, but these are never mined to their full extent. Likewise, we're never given any concrete information about what the Bureau really is (and who its members really are). Are they spiritual entities? Aliens? Trans- dimensional beings? We never know, and these questions end up being more burdensome than any grander subtext that the screenwriters tried to weave into the script.A lot of people would likely say that worrying about the origins of the Bureau is criminal, as that's not really the focus of the film. I'd respond by saying there's some truth to that, but the minimalist philosophical dabbling of the story coupled with the 'yeah, right' factor that ultimately arises from the presence of the all-knowing men in black is too problematic to ignore.",5,1,1,26 December 2012
Alice in Wonderland," Follow the White Rabbit
","If there's anyone who could ably bring Lewis Carroll's vision of Alice in Wonderland to the silver screen, it'd certainly be Tim Burton. Of course, one would expect a director best known for injecting the macabre (in one form or another) into his films to do the same here. In that sense Burton doesn't disappoint, as his version of Wonderland contains rivers of blood that are filled with severed heads and potions that are comprised of detached digits.As gory as it sounds, much of this is done in a slightly more subtle manner than might be expected, and it nicely compliments the surreal nature of this somewhat abstract environment.But let's back up for a minute. This isn't Alice in Wonderland as you and I know it. I'm not all that familiar with Through the Looking Glass, but—in my estimation—this movie exists as sort of a pseudo-sequel that finds Alice being summoned in order to slay the legendary Jabberwocky and, by doing so, free Wonderland of the tyranny it's suffered under the rule of the Red Queen. What's odd, though, is that Alice has absolutely no recollection of her previous adventure. The reason for her amnesia isn't clearly explained, but one can surmise that it's directly connected to what she's experienced in the 'real world'— the one you and I are familiar with, and the locale that the film opens in. On her way to a shindig that's being hosted by English nobility, it's revealed that Alice is expected to accept a marriage proposal from a young man who's been groomed as a Lord. He's wealthy and well- respected, and everyone has informed the now twenty-something that it's only logical that she become a wife while her youthful beauty persists. She, of course, is skeptical of all this, and, upon being proposed to, darts from the scene. It's not long before she's tumbling down the mystical rabbit hole of lore, and the rest—as they say—is history.What I particularly enjoyed about Burton's approach to Wonderland is the symbolism implicit in many of the characters. When we see Tweedledee and Tweedledum, for example, it's clear that they're meant to represent Faith and Fiona (two young ladies from the pre-rabbit-hole existence who implore Alice to accept Lord Ascot's proposal). There are several other manifestations in Wonderland that correlate with the angst Alice has experienced in her 'other' life, and the connection is likely clear enough that children will be able to pick up on the underlying message (which, much to my dismay, is eventually spelled out for viewers). And that, of course, is that you have to choose your own path in life.But really, people will see Alice in Wonderland for its decidedly unusual visuals. As previously mentioned, Burton manages to successfully blend his own taste for the twisted with the quirky universe that Carroll has crafted in his Wonderland series. There are talking frogs and bloodhounds, a caterpillar with a hookah (expertly voiced by Alan Rickman), and a demonic iteration of the Jabberwocky that's reminiscent of the dragon found in Sleeping Beauty. All in all, Wonderland is brought to life in exquisite detail.I've heard complaints that the finale of the film is too Narnia-esque in its aspirations, but, from everything I experienced leading up to the battle that takes place on a giant chessboard, it felt every bit as epic as its scale implied (which actually isn't all that epic, but just epic enough). If anything was out of place in the movie, it was the shockingly stupid dance performed by the Mad Hatter (Depp) in the final minutes. It's not often that a five second shot is enough to ruin the tone of an entire movie, but this scene was so ridiculous that one could feel the entire theater cringe with embarrassment. Yes—it's that bad.Bad-Elaine-Benes-dances aside, this is a wonderfully imaginative movie that's got just the right amount of subtext for the kiddies. There are times where it's likely too dark for especially sensitive viewers, but most of the children present at the screening I attended were giggling and marveling for the bulk of the 108 minute runtime. And that, in and of itself, is quite an accomplishment.",8,1,3,26 December 2012
Avatar," It's a Whole New World
","Finally, after a year of hype and endless speculation about what effect it would have on the motion picture industry, James Cameron's Avatar has arrived. Having finished watching it not more than an hour ago, I'm here to spell it out for you: go see this movie immediately. It's a breathtaking spectacle, and one that's almost impossible to process in one viewing. Avatar is nothing short of revolutionary, serving as a visual opus for the ages and a guiding light for the future of filmmaking. So, now that I'm done heaping unconditional praise on Cameron's grand return to the multiplex, let's break this thing down.Exhibit A: the story. If you've read any of the early reviews of the film, you're aware of the fact that many critics have declared Avatar a success solely on the technical front. This was something that worried me as I excitedly donned the yellow 3D glasses issued me by my local Regal Cinema, but not even 15 minutes into the film all of those fears had dissolved. The story is solid all around, and it features a number of standout performances. I have to tip my hat to Zoe Saldana first and foremost. Saldana plays Neytiri, a member of the Na'vi species that inhabits the planet Pandora. Working just beneath the photo-realistic surface of a CGIer-hem'avatar'she manages to elicit the strongest emotional response from viewers by really making us care about the welfare of her people.I have to be honest: going into this, the premise seemed a little too Dances With Wolves (and thus in grave danger of succumbing to cliché and, of course, the resultant eye-rolling). Thankfully, though, the story is presented with enough originality to stand on its own. Cameron nicely balances what can only be described as National Geographic-esque documentary footage with the story of a budding romance between Jake Sully (Worthington)—a marine with a chip on his shoulder—and Neytiri. There's also the presence of a greedy corporate executive and a hardened military Colonel, both of whom execute their respective roles admirably. The narrative is completely absorbing, and only on very brief occasions does it falter and break the trance it has on the audience. These moments come in the form of treatises on global warming and the many ways 'terrorism' can be defined, and they are indeed noticeable when they arrive (mainly because they're in such sharp contrast to the otherwise engrossing story line). Cameron, it seems, works best when he's dealing with broader philosophical concepts (see Terminator 2: Judgment Day). There are also a handful of other 'Oh, that's convenient' moments, but these are also few and far between. Really, the tale Cameron spins for us is very well constructed. It's all logical, and despite how fantastic some of the things you see on screen may seem, you still believe in their existence.Which brings me to the effects. In a word, they're phenomenal. I'm always hesitant to use the word 'ever' when writing a review—I think long and hard before actually including it in anything I write—but Avatar is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. Even though the Na'vi are entirely fictional, they look real. I mean, really real. This is also the case with every other organism inhabiting Pandora. The success of what you see on screen is due mainly to the fluidity of movement (especially in the case of the Na'vi); the sense that it's all 'organic' pervades every frame, and the attention paid to detail is mind-boggling. It's clear that Cameron is really enjoying mulling over the intricacies of a piece of Pandoran fruit, for example (especially when Jake's avatar takes a big bite out of it), and we can't help but be swept up in the grandiose nature of it all. In one particular scene, where Jake and Neytiri are running across a phosphorescent/bioluminescent mold of some sort, things verge on sensory overload (and I mean that in a very, very good way).The use of 3D is, of course, integral to the convincing nature of what you're seeing, and there are no gimmicks here. Unlike past movies where objects stick out and threaten to poke you in the face, the third dimension is subtlety (yet effectively) utilized in Avatar. As a matter of fact, it won't be long before you forget that you're wearing dopey yellow sunglasses. When people call this film a viewing experience, that's exactly what it is: an experience. I can talk about it 'til I'm blue in the face, but you won't really understand until you strap yourself into the center of the theater and dive headlong into the entirely believable world that Cameron and company have created.And, as with any good James Cameron movie, there are plenty of 'awweeesoommmeee!' action moments. Again, I think it's futile for me to try and describe them, but they rival anything from his earlier entries (yes—that includes Aliens and T2). Especially great is the epic final battle, as is a heart-stopping chase scene that occurs early on between Jake and an indigenous beast.If ever there were a movie that you absolutely must see on the big screen, this is it. And, if it's at all possible, see it in IMAX. You can thank me later.",9,3,6,26 December 2012
Drag Me to Hell," One of Raimi's Finest
","After taking a break from horror for 17 years, Sam Raimi finally decided to return to the genre that made him a household name for fans of cult horror classics. The latest from the director of the Evil Dead trilogy is a riot. It demonstrates masterly control of the too-often misused 'jump' scare, and it's funny—really funny. Raimi's peculiar brand of camp likely won't appeal to everyone, but if you're looking for a fun horror movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, this is one tongue- in-cheek romp that shouldn't be missed.Our protagonist is Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), a loan officer at a Los Angeles bank who's trying to get promoted. After being encouraged to prove to her boss that she's able to make the tough decisions required of the assistant manager job she so badly desires, she decides not to grant a mortgage extension to an elderly woman who visits her office. This isn't just any old lady, though—she's a gypsy with knowledge of black magic. After being rejected and being 'shamed' (as she puts it), she places a curse on Christine. After 3 days of continuous torment, a dark spirit will literally—as the title indicates— drag her to hell.As ridiculous as the plot sounds, it's actually quite intense during certain scenes. Raimi, as previously mentioned, has mastered the art of the 'jump' scare with this latest entry. Even though it's clear the over-the-top tone pervades every scene, you'll likely still find yourself anticipating the inevitable scare (only to have it appear when you least expect it). There are a plethora of 'gross-out' scenes in this one, too, which includes green fluid pouring out of the mouth of an overturned corpse and onto Christine; nosebleeds that spray across rooms and soak coworkers; and, as with any movie dealing with the dark arts, ritual sacrifice that causes us to simultaneously cringe and chuckle.Really, there's nothing particularly new about Drag Me to Hell—it's just that what's there is so well done that it feels like you're witnessing a hybrid classic/contemporary horror movie. In many ways it's a spoof, but it's also an effective little splatter flick—it knows exactly how to send up genre clichés while still demonstrating respect for their power. Among other things, this makes Drag Me to Hell the perfect date movie: it's not too serious, and everyone involved will have a killer (no pun intended) time.There you have it. Raimi's back and has proved that after all this time he hasn't sold out to Hollywood convention. So what are you waiting for? Pop a bag of Orville Redenbacher's and prepare yourself for one of the most entertaining horror movies to come along in quite some time.",9,1,3,26 December 2012
Invictus," I Think He Wants Us to Win the World Cup
","Over the past few weeks, the world has seen the release of two very well made sports movies. First we received The Blind Side, and now Invictus, the latest from Clint Eastwood. The 79 year old actor—whose best known for his roles as grizzled lawmen—has certainly proved his ability as a filmmaker during his twilight years, and Invictus is no exception. Thankfully, he doesn't seem to be slowing down one iota.Invictus tells the story of Nelson Mandela (Freeman), the former President of South Africa and the man credited with unifying a country riddled with racism and turmoil in the wake of apartheid. Given Mandela's astonishing achievements, one would think the movie would be laden with dramatic flashbacks that clearly highlight the struggle he suffered as a prisoner for 27 years. Eastwood, it seems, has decided to take a different approach to telling this story.The catalyst for this particular tale is rugby; a sport that many Americans know nothing about (admittedly, I knew little about the game going into the theater, but I did feel as if I had a better grasp of the sport as a whole when I walked out). This could easily be viewed in a negative way, as the bulk of the third act is focused solely on the rugby World Cup match that took place in 1995. Eastwood clearly revels in the brutality of the sport, as it nicely symbolizes the struggle the country was going through at that time. When teams lock arms and spar over field position, it's clear just how painful the process is, and this adds even more depth to the same issues that—unlikely as it is— District 9 grappled with only a few months earlier.Matt Damon plays Francois Pienaar, captain of the South African rugby team. This is a role that seems well-suited to Damon, whose solemn determination is exactly what Mandela needed as a face for the symbolic triumph over prejudice that he saw embodied in the competition. The acting honors, however, clearly go to Freeman. If there's anyone who was destined to play Mandela, it's him—Freeman's mastery of the man's mannerisms, accent, and general presence is astounding. There aren't really any scenes that call for the emotional outbursts typically needed to garner an Oscar nod, but I have a feeling the sheer power of the movie as a whole will land Freeman a much deserved nomination.That's the thing about Invictus–at its core, it seems to be nothing more than an inspirational sports film, but there are many other issues rippling just beneath the surface. One could nitpick about the decision to film this 'documentary style,' with only limited (extremely limited) glimpses into Mandela's past, and I'd have to agree that it leaves a little bit of a hole in an otherwise absorbing movie. The message it sends to audiences, though, is what makes the final product so effective. And that, of course, is that athletics play a very important role in any society: they act as the ultimate unifying medium. Themes of bias and discrimination generate a lot tension, but when the final match is underway, everyone puts their differences aside (and inadvertently comes to the realization that we're all one and the same).As far as motivational sports films go, you could do a lot worse, and the patient directorial eye of Eastwood will cause you to linger on every frame. I wouldn't say the movie is unforgettable, but it is a welcome pick-me-up that takes an optimistic stance on the nature of mankind.",7,1,2,29 December 2012
Crazy Heart," Not Nearly as Twangy as you Might Expect
","Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors, and just so happens to be the leading man in two of my favorite films (The Big Lebowski and Arlington Road). Now 61 years young, he's certainly showing no signs of slowing down.Crazy Heart, the 2009 offering for which Bridges took home the Oscar for Best Actor, is a prime example of the acting titan's ability to consistently breathe credibility into any variety of characters. Think of it as an optimistic version of Aronofsky's The Wrestler (though it doesn't resonate on quite so many levels).Here, our protagonist is Bad Blake, an aging country music legend who's been reduced to churning out the same tired songs in bowling alleys, side street restaurants, and the like. Bad makes no bones about the fact that he's tired of his career existing on the verge of oblivion, but he's also conscious of the fact that his problems are a result of his diseased condition. Bad's a chain-smoking alcoholic who has plenty of domestic issues he's trying to sort out, and his nightly post- performance routine involves liaisons with less-than-reputable female admirers.All of that begins to change when he meets Jean (Gyllenhaal), a Santa Fe journalist who who's trying to start her career as an entertainment writer. The two hit it off almost immediately, and some genuine emotions lead to a relationship that accurately mirrors the non- Hollywood (insert 'harsh') complexity found in real life affinities.There are a few predictable 'bumps in the road' for Bad and Jean, but the story never deteriorates into the usual sequence of mistakes which finds a reconciled couple kissing as the credits roll. On top of this— as previously indicated—Crazy Heart is surprisingly upbeat. Though Bad has his fair share of issues, the movie makes a clear statement that recovery (especially from the dark dredges of alcoholism) is, in fact, possible. It even goes a step further by highlighting what life beyond such a wretched state is like.That's what I like most about Crazy Heart—the fact that it doesn't take (what is now) a clichéd route with its plot. Sure, people die from the same things Bad is battling on a daily basis, but there are many who overcome their circumstances. This is something that director Scott Cooper and novelist Thomas Cobb obviously wanted to emphasize, and I heartily applaud the decision.Crazy Heart is worth your time. It doesn't 'reinvent the wheel,' but stellar acting and an able story make it that rare faux biopic that leaves you smiling instead of grinding your teeth as you mull over the bitter fruit of the world's debauchery.",8,2,2,26 December 2012
Inception," I Dreamed a Dream
","Back in 1999, I was a junior in high school, and a little movie called The Matrix was unleashed upon the world. I remember going to see it with a friend; we were both fairly oblivious regarding the nature of the plot, as well as the presence of the now famous stylized (and infinitely duplicated) action sequences. Leaving the theater, I had the distinct feeling that I'd seen something revolutionary—as ambiguous as that term may be—and that I had really only processed a fraction of what was taking place on screen. During the wee hours of this past morning— around 2:35 AM, to be exact—that feeling of having experienced something undeniably groundbreaking was finally replicated.As a matter of fact, I'll go so far as to say that Inception surpasses The Matrix on nearly every level. It's that rare film which is simply unforgettable, thriving on superb acting, a brilliantly layered story, and mesmerizing choreography.If you've seen the trailers—and who hasn't?—you might be a little confused as to what it's all about, so let me take a stab at cluing you in. Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) is an 'extractor'—a person who's hired to create an artificial dreamworld (an oxymoron?) and steal people's secrets while they sleep. This, of course, is illegal, and for a variety of reasons Cobb has been globetrotting for some time to avoid capture. He's also an estranged father, and is believed to be guilty in the murder of his wife (who frequently shows up in each of the dream environments he constructs). Anyway, entering the human mind is apparently a fairly straightforward task, and it's all accomplished via a device that was originally developed for military training.After a botched attempt to extract information from a wealthy businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe), he's hired to perform what's known as an 'inception.' Essentially, it's the highly controversial notion that you can plant an idea in someone's mind to cause him/her to behave in a specific way. In this instance, Saito wants Cobb to convince the heir of an energy tycoon to break up his father's empire. This is in Saito's interest because it eliminates his only competition, thus allowing his corporation to exist as an unfettered monopoly. If Cobb is able to successfully do this, says Saito, he'll pull a few strings and Cobb will be able to return to his native America and once again be with this children.I've obviously left out a lot of key details, but trust me when I say the plot—though admittedly complex—is wholly engaging and completely rewarding. As a number of critics have noted, Inception demands that its viewers' intellect is engaged full throttle as things progress, and I found that this was a natural consequence of being thrust into the story. In other words, it didn't seem like a 'chore' to really think deeply about what was happening on screen; it was second nature. The film moves at a brisk pace, but it provides enough cues to remind you of certain narrative intricacies that might otherwise have dissolved into your own subconscious.As you'd imagine, the setup is a veritable cornucopia of possibilities for action junkies. I found myself collecting my jaw from the theater floor as cityscapes folded in on themselves and modernistic dreamscapes crumbled because of protruding influences from the outside world. Of special note is a prolonged car chase sequence. It pushes the boundaries of time perception, and takes the notion of stacking one dream atop another to new levels. Let me elaborate briefly (and I'll try to do so without ruining any of the surprise that inevitably comes with such a thrilling tale).Our protagonists—a team of 'dream thieves,' if you will—enter the dreams of their intended target. Once there, they're attacked by his subconscious, which has been trained to defend against just this sort of 'break in.' As they try to buy themselves time so that they can accomplish their goal, they enter a dream within that dream and find that they're now able to interact with their mark in an entirely new fashion. As the car chase continues in the original dream, though, they feel the physical effects in their new dream. When their driver takes a sharp turn, for instance, their gravity shifts in the new dream, and they're all thrown to one side of a room.Yeah, I know. It sounds crazy complicated. It is. Trust me, though, when I say that it all makes complete sense within the context of the story, and you'll marvel at Nolan's ability to generate a plot that asks so much of its audience.This, of course, is only the tip of the iceberg, and there are some excellently crafted subplots that tackle more universal issues (such as learning how to 'let go' of lost loved ones, etc.). It's the sort of movie that warrants a seemingly infinite number of viewings, and you'll find yourself analyzing its idiosyncrasies for decades to come.I'll close by saying Inception is not only the best film I've seen thus far in 2010, it's one of the best I've ever seen, and has rightfully earned a spot on my Top 10 list. This is a moment in cinematic history that shouldn't be missed.",10,1,3,29 December 2012
Defiance," A Lesson in Sociology
","By its very nature, Defiance is a movie that has an incredible story driving its narrative, so it seems as if it would be hard to 'get it wrong' (in a sense). While Zwick tells the story of a community of Jews surviving the Belorussian wilderness in the midst of World War II fairly competently, there isn't much here that can't be found in other classics that deal with this particular time period.In fact, the most fascinating aspect of the film is watching a group of 3 expand into a self-sufficient society. Defiance (oddly enough) feels more like a case study of how individuals jockey for power when separated from just about all external influences. Sociologists will no doubt find it fascinating to watch two intellectuals isolate themselves from the collective whole and discuss politics, etc. while others act as bullies for things as simple as slightly larger portions of food than what the rest of the group receives. While this is all mildly thought- provoking, I didn't have an overwhelming sense that human will can triumph over any hardship as one might expect from such a plot. The film seemed trapped in a purgatory of sorts, hovering somewhere between a scientific analysis of how communities are started (and subsequently evolve) and what it means to be human and exercise control–I'm leaving that purposely ambiguous–in the face of daunting odds. There's nothing inherently wrong with exploring both of these, but, in the case of Defiance, it seemed like it was being stretched far too thin, and should've focused completely on one or the other.So, is this worth paying $10+ to see at a theater? No. Is it worth a rental? Yes, if for nothing more than to gain a little insight into what your sociology professor was trying to explain while you tried not to drool on your desk.",6,1,2,26 December 2012
The Blind Side," Not Quite a Touchdown, but it's in the Red Zone
","The juggernauts of gridiron cinema—such as Rudy and Remember the Titans— almost all have one thing in common: they're unapologetically formulaic, but they're also extraordinarily well done. Sports movies of one variety or another are produced every year, but it's rare that any of them really leave a lasting impression on the collective American consciousness. More often than not, they're nothing more than exercises in the art of telling the classic inspiration story; you know, the faithful underdog overcoming crushing odds (think 'David and Goliath'). In Rudy, it was all about a runt with larger-than-life aspirations. In John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side, it's all about a larger-than-life (literally) teen who just wants a bed he can call his own. He's not thinking about what will happen years down the road; he's only thinking about where he'll find his next meal.It's based on the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a down- and-out Memphis teen who regularly wanders in and out of foster homes. His mother is a coke-fiend, and he has no family to watch after him. However, thanks to the generosity of a friend, he's introduced to the football coach of a private Christian school and is admitted on the basis of his formidable athletic presence. Michael still has no home, however; he picks up half-eaten bags of popcorn at his school's gym after volleyball games so he's able to eat. He spends his evenings keeping warm inside a local laundromat.One night, Leigh Anne Tuohy, the wife of a wealthy fast-food entrepreneur, sees him walking the streets and brings him home. Her family provides him with new clothing and a bed of his own. All of this happens so quickly, in fact, that my first instinct was to say, 'Wow— this would never happen.' The whole setup, in fact, seems so naively optimistic that it screams Hollywood contrivance. However, there's one catch to all this that's easy to forget: like the previously mentioned Rudy, it's a true story. As such, the movie has, to a certain degree, some wiggle room in terms of exploring scenarios that would otherwise reverberate as totally unrealistic or totally clichéd. I suppose, however, that clichés sometimes receive their namesake because they are, in fact, reality for so many people.To my surprise, this fact actually causes The Blind Side to excel where other movies might've fizzled. The whole thing—though often derivative— feels very 'matter-of-fact.' The deeper into the story you go, the more genuine it feels. Wisely, Hancock has chosen to spin his tale by letting the actors and a steady camera do the work. There are no overly dramatic camera angles, and the soundtrack is minimal. The dialogue is a little over-the-top at times, but it's not so much that's distracting. Really, what we get here are a lot of unadorned scenes that depict our protagonist going about his daily activities, merely trying to survive. The 128-minute runtime does start to wear a little thin as things come to a close, but it's hard to imagine much of the story being cut. I guess that's one of the difficulties of telling a 'true story': it's often hard to know what is essential and what's extracurricular.What really stands out in The Blind Side, however, is its penchant for probing the social class divide that so many Americans either ignore or pretend doesn't exist. Despite its references to Norman Rockwell and the plight of the working poor, I'm not quite ready to heap unconditional praise on the movie. It's exploration of these concepts is far from subtle, and is often presented in such a way as to almost shout, 'Hey, stupid! Do something about this!' It's not that I question the film's call to action, it's just that its presentation is like a brick to the forehead. We're bombarded with images of dirty apartments, broken homes, and life 'on the other side of the tracks.' My hope was that the movie's early use of flashback would get this particular job done in a much more subtle way, but Hancock and co. decided to take a more blunt approach that, in my estimation, takes a little something away from the overall 'bite.'So, what are my final thoughts on The Blind Side?It's frequently gooey and predictable. At times its unabashed desire to make you blubber like an infant will be infuriating. Oddly enough, though, it's also very genuine, and no one can deny the inherent truth of its many messages.",7,0,0,26 December 2012
Halloween," The Night He Came Home
","It's that time of year again, when candy clatters around the inside of plastic pumpkins and horror movies descend on cable television like zombies assaulting an isolated farmhouse in the hopes of scoring some freshly scooped brains for dinner. In honor of the shifting season and my favorite month of the year, I've determined that there's no better way to honor All Hallow's Eve than by review each and every Halloween movie. There are 8 if you discount the Rob Zombie debacles—which I do— so, over the course of the next several weeks, reviews of each will follow in steady succession.So, without further ado, let's dig into entry #1: Halloween.If you're new to the Michael Myers universe, allow me to let you in on a little secret—this is the movie that started it all. Many credit the original Halloween as being the father of the modern slasher flick, but, as I've stated in previous reviews, it is my contention that said honor falls squarely in the lap of Hitchcock's Psycho. Nevertheless, Halloween helped usher in the contemporary horror film, which is defined by cheap scares, brutal violence, and, for lack of a better term, a 'robotic' killer.Here, the killer's name is Michael. At the beginning of the movie, director John Carpenter introduces us to our antagonist by smartly utilizing a first-person perspective. We don't know that the killer is only a boy until after we're allowed to see him murder his teenage sister (who's prone to fornication and late night hair brushing, something that we'll later learn is a staple of the modern horror flick) with an over-sized kitchen knife. Fast forward a decade or so. Michael has spent his time since committing his crime in a maximum security mental institution under the watchful eye of Dr. Sam Loomis, a brooding psychiatrist who believes to be the now full-grown adult to be the full embodiment of true evil. Late one night, Michael manages to escape his confines, secure an awesomely wood-paneled station wagon, and return to his hometown to finish what he started; specifically, to 'off' Laurie Strode, his baby sister and the last surviving member of his family.What follows is a slow burn that ultimately leads to Michael slaughtering a smattering of unruly teens up and down the street he once inhabited. More important than 'what' happens, though, is 'how' it happens. As previously indicated, everything about Halloween has come to define 'horror' as we know it, and the mechanical pursuit of his sister—played by a young Jamie Lee Curtis—helped vault the actress into stardom. The final thirty minutes are especially nerve-racking, and everything that plays out is a little too realistic to be written off as sheer scary-movie-fancy. This, among a myriad of other elements, helps give Halloween the staying power that it's enjoyed for thirty-plus years.If you consider yourself a student of horror and have never seen Halloween you're doing yourself a grave (hardy har har) disservice. In other words, go buy it. Immediately. And revel in one of the great slasher flicks of our time.",10,1,2,27 December 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Conclusion We Deserve
","The unprecedented fervor surrounding the release of the final Batman film of Christopher Nolan's highly acclaimed trilogy is something we probably should have seen coming. Fans of the films are rabid about the movies getting their just dues, and it's become the (unfortunate) habit of many a fanboy to go ballistic on anyone who is a naysayer. That said, these people are devotees of the series for a reason: each of the two previous offerings have been nothing short of fantastic, and there was no reason to believe that the third—and final—installment, The Dark Knight Rises, would be any different.The question that's on everyone's mind, of course, is if it really does meet (and ultimately exceed) the impossibly high standards set by its predecessors. The answer is a resounding 'yes.' The Dark Knight Rises is incredibly ambitious and incredibly satisfying; it's also the best film of the trilogy.Allow me to explain why.In both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Gotham was in peril. Madmen assailed the city's citizens for varying reasons—some more concrete than others—while a troubled hero in Bruce Wayne sought to use his resources (namely access to incredibly advantageous weaponry and a whole slew of kick-assery he obtained while a brief member of the League of Shadows) to disarm those would see the town destroyed. While his character has always been interesting, Bruce Wayne hasn't been a truly engrossing dramatic figure. That all changes with The Dark Knight Rises.Here, we see Bruce/Batman's tragedy and redemption come around full circle. At the start of the movie, Wayne is a man crippled by the exploits he's undertaken as the caped crusader. He's a recluse who's holed up in Wayne Manor. As we're allowed to see him move beyond exchanging witty barbs with his longtime butler (and caretaker) Alfred Pennyworth, the emotional pay-dirt finally emerges, and the character—in the words of the late Ra's Al Ghul—becomes more than just a man. He becomes the embodiment of grief; here, it's clear that there's a tangible psychological block that's eating Bruce from the inside out. The first hour of Rises is devoted to mining this pain, and it makes Bale's portrayal of Bruce more accessible than ever.Then there's the action, which hits its stride about halfway through the production. Once it gets going, it's relentless and, for lack of a better word, harrowing. Everything that's happening in the streets of Gotham has weight behind it, as the city faces a challenge unlike anything that's come before.I feel like I'm on the verge of spilling the beans about some major plot points, so I'll wind things down by saying that the supporting cast—Tom Hardy as Bane and Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle—are all splendid. They each bring something crucial to their characters, and not a moment of screen time is wasted.I don't need to tell you this, but if you haven't already purchased your ticket for Nolan's epic conclusion to what will go down as one of the best trilogies in movie history, then you need to get on the ball. After all, this is one of those rare occurrences in cinema—the emergence of a truly great movie that actually lives up to every ounce of hype.Nicely done, Mr. Nolan. You deserve the Oscar nods that are surely coming your way.",10,10,17,26 December 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," One Last Wave of the Wand
","Ten years after its debut, the Harry Potter film franchise has drawn to a close. The dedicated fan-based generated by the book series of the same name has been subject to a fairly consistent variety of offerings, but never (in my estimation, at least) has any one of the pictures ventured into the realm of being truly 'bad.' Thankfully, the same can be said for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. Is it epic? Not at all. But it is a slam-bang finale that—for the most part— satisfies.Picking up where Deathly Hallows: Part 1 concluded, the final act of the film has a much more action-oriented focus. The story, of course, continues to revolve around mystical items called 'horcruxes,' the persistent evil of Lord Voldemort, and the whimsical stuff that otherwise defines the alternate world in which Hogwarts exists. The final 'revelations' are not entirely predictable, but anyone moderately familiar with Potter lore should have a solid idea as to where the whole thing is going to end up. In a sense, that's one of the things that's made the Harry Potter story so successful: it's a clear-cut case of good vs. evil, and, given the ridiculously muddled narrative webs that many tales are caught up in these days, that's an extreme rarity. I mean, really: in the final moments, when Harry and Voldemort are wand-dueling and red and green sparks are flying, one can't help but think of other similar confrontations (think Luke Skywalker vs Darth Vader, Frodo vs. Gollem, ad infinitum). At its core, then, the movie is fueled by a basic—though extraordinarily powerful—mythos that's hard to ignore.The movie isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, though.In fact, it suffers from a similar syndrome that just about all stories with an abundance of fantastical elements seem to think is absolutely necessary: namely, a crazy amount of overblown battle sequences. Don't get me wrong: I enjoy this sort of thing every once in a while. I do, however, think that the story has to merit the inclusion of such a large-scale confrontation, though. Here, when goody-two-shoes- professors and minions-of-the-Dark-Lord face off amid the ruins of the once proud School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, there's a sense that things are a bit well forced. It's as if the filmmakers came to the realization that they were at the end, and that this was the appropriate time to plug-in sweeping armies, etc. It also seems as if the long- awaited showdown between Harry and Voldemort was much too tame. It's got its moments, but when the inevitable comes to pass, I found myself whispering, 'Really? That's it?'I know what you're thinking: well, it was better in the book. That may be true. But this isn't the book: it's the movie. And after investing countless hours in this cosmic collision that should be the end-all, be- all of the Potter universe, the unfathomably large audience that's waited patiently for this final installment deserves something much more grandiose.I say all of this with love. I really did have fun watching the movie. It's just that that special 'something' that makes up a classic seems to be just out of arm's-reach. When taken as a whole, though, there's no denying the power of the spectacle of one of the better movie series to come along in quite some time.",7,0,1,27 December 2012
Looper," It Doesn't Exactly Rewrite History
","Looper is a movie that's been on my radar for quite some time. It's about mafia-types who are involved in time travel for the sake of eliminating unwanted 'garbage,' and it features both the formidable Bruce Willis and Nightwing himself, Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Because I don't have quite as much free time as I used to, I had to skip this one in theaters. When it finally trickled down the DVD/Blu-ray format earlier this week, however, I was all over it.This is the perfect example of a movie that quietly made its way into cinemas without having an overabundance of pomp and circumstance paving the way. I'd taken a fleeting interest in it upon reading about the movie's story line, but it wasn't until a multitude of friends took to Facebook in order to sing its unparalleled praises that I genuinely took interest. And, I have to say, though solidly crafted it is, I found the movie to be a bit of a letdown. Let me explain why.With any time travel flick, one expects there to be plenty of mind- bending timelines that crisscross with one another (heck, they may even congeal into something indecipherable in the final moments, but the goal is to keep the audience playing the 'prediction' game throughout). While Looper does this, I found it far too easy to foresee how things would play out (this was in stark contrast to 12 Monkeys, Willis' other time travel movie). To delve into the specifics of this would put me at risk of including spoilers in my review, so suffice it to say that, though well written, there was nothing Earth-shattering about our protagonists' concluding revelation. Another point of contention—and one that has been widely discussed, I believe—was the decision to drown JGL in make-up so as to make him resemble a young Willis. At times, it works, but more often than not I found it nearly impossible to not envision the actor with his true face. Would it have been better to simply allow JGL to be, well, himself, and to sparingly use CGI to fill in the awkward transition moments during his character's life? I don't know. Still, I can't ignore the fact that the make-up was more of a distraction than a boon.Actually, I think Looper's greatest strength is its focus on the development of telekinesis as a part of the human genome in the not too distant future. Some of the film's best moments come as a result of this plot point, and I wish a little more focus on this would have been the order of the day.Please don't misunderstand me. Looper is far better than the vast majority of drivel that Hollywood allows to make it past the stages of early drafting, and it makes for perfectly good viewing for anyone who enjoys sci-fi. Just don't expect it to rewrite history.",7,1,2,3 January 2013
50_50," Laughter is the Best Medicine
","50/50 is a drama. And a comedy. And one of the better films to come down the pike in 2011.Because of the very nature of its story, it should be no surprise that the movie is emotionally draining. What might be surprising, though, is that it's uplifting in equal measure. Rather than wallowing in the wake of its protagonist's recent cancer diagnosis, it takes the route of allowing its audience a glimpse into the life of a man who's struggling to overcome more than just the disease that serves as the proverbial MacGuffin. At times, the movie is guilty of conforming to indie/rom-com clichés that have defined the genre for the past five (or so) years, but the leads are so likable—and the writing is so crisp, poignant, and utterly hilarious—that it's hard to point to such tendencies as a fault.As usual, Rogen and company are able to bottle the 'real life' conversation and observations that assign a tangible identity to the neo-nerd pop culture that is the twenty-something male of contemporary society. Because of this, what could have easily been a draining slog through the life of a disgruntled cancer patient becomes a celebration of latching onto anything (and everything) that has substance. The evolution of Adam (Levitt) is realistic and touching, and by the time the inevitable 'confrontation' takes place, you'll feel like you've endured something miraculous.To further comment on the layered plot and what it implies about the needs of everyone 'surviving' all walks of life would be to ruin some of the more unexpected revelations that come from 50/50, so I'll end by saying, quite simply, that it's a wonderful movie.In fact, there's a 99.9% chance that you'll leave the theater with a huge smile on your face. And I'm willing to bet not too many people saw that coming.",9,3,4,26 December 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Cube Meets Evil Dead
","People are weary of the same tired formula that's propelled horror movies since the slasher renaissance of the early '80s. With this in mind, writers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard set out to pen something unique—something that would utterly shock audiences and absolutely lambaste the conventions of the modern horror film. With The Cabin in the Woods, the ably accomplish this task. The otherwise mundane title nicely hides the fact that moviegoers are in for an experience so unorthodox—and, at times, so downright bizarre—that they'll likely stagger out of the theater scratching their heads in an attempt to make sense of what essentially boils down to one hour and thirty-five minutes of unadulterated chaos.The Cabin in the Woods is a tricky little number to review in that I can't really discuss the plot in much dept because of the very great risk of ruining some of the more shocking revelations that define its second half. Still, right from the opening credits the movie doesn't hide the fact that it's trying something new. Viewers are thrust into a sterile setting that finds two lab technicians chattering about trifles that don't mesh with what anyone setting into their seats would expect. This is a good thing, as it sets the tone from the beginning: 'I'm going to be straightforward with you, dear viewer,' the flick suggests, 'but don't think I won't pull any punches along the way.'After the initial confusion tapers, the standard horror routine plays out: a group of college-age supermodels descends on a rickety cabin in the middle of nowhere. They're primed and ready for a weekend filled with booze, drugs, unprotected sex, so on and so forth. They also exhibit the personas one would expect in just this sort of offering: there's a jock, a slutty vixen, a stoner, a goodie-two shoes who's hesitant to do anything remotely dangerous, etc. The usual hijinks occur for the next several scenes, and then we're catapulted back into the lab environment and given a deeper understanding of what's really happening. From this point on, all hell breaks loose (almost literally).While the charm of the movie's originality is undeniable—and it's penchant for juvenile humor is greatly appreciated—there's something a little forced about the whole thing that (in my mind, at least) doesn't elevate it to the echelons of cinematic gold that movies like Tucker & Dale vs. Evil are able to obtain. As stated earlier, Cabin is meant to vaporize all notions of the modern horror movie, and it mostly succeeds. Surprisingly, the complex nature of the plot eventually begins to backfire. You'll find yourself trying to connect dots that are much too difficult—or, even worse, can't—be connected, and there's the sense that a crucial narrative element is absent.In fact, I'm still trying to pin down what this is, exactly, and this is problematic.This can be forgiven, though, when the comedic-gratuitousness of the third act hits the fan. It's unrestrained brutality, our worst nightmares made tangible in the form of a brew-ha-ha that will leave you speechless. If ever there were a slam-bang ending, what we get with the finale of Cabin is just that.So, in that regard, the movie is a success. Still, there's the sense that it could have been put together just a little more effectively, and that might be what ultimately defines this fine exercise in reworking a genre that's suffered from tedium for far",7,1,5,26 December 2012
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," You Have Chosen... Wisely
","Talk about a return to form.After the decidedly underwhelming (when compared to Raiders, that is) Temple of Doom, Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford managed to put together one of the greatest action-adventure movies to ever see the light of day. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade got everything right: it had the perfect comedic duo in Harrison Ford and Sean Connery; the action topped just about everything that had occurred in the previous two Indy films; the narrative returned its focus to the ultimate villain (Nazis) and once again had the fate of the world resting squarely on the shoulders of the rugged archaeologist who was the embodiment of all things good. Last Crusade helped solidify the notion that stellar sequels are, in fact, possible.Just about everyone has seen this, so allow me to focus on specifics. The score is every bit as classic as it was the first time we heard it in Raiders, and the bits designed specifically for this offering are, all-in-all, equally as memorable. The 'booby traps' are spectacular (especially the 'devices of lethal cunning' that Dr. Jones must navigate during the final leg of his journey); the decision to begin the film with a flashback of Indy in his youth is a stroke of genius, and River Phoenix perfectly imitates Mr. Ford's most subtle mannerisms; and, of course, there's the previously mentioned presence of none other than the original James Bond himself.Connery is, for lack of a better word, the perfect foil to Ford. Whereas Indy is often reckless and tends to dive into dangerous situations headfirst, Henry Jones Sr. is calm, collected, and every bit the logical sage one would imagine the father of Indiana Jones to be.If there's any spot where Last Crusade falls short of Raiders it has to be in regards to its leading woman. Don't get me wrong: Elsa is a great double-crossing she-devil. But superior to Marion Ravenwood? Negative.Next up is Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. That's right. The fridge is about to be nuked.",10,1,2,29 December 2012
Jurassic Park," So, What About That 3D Treatment?
","I was 11 years old when Jurassic Park was released. I vividly remember going to see it at my local theater. The place was packed; there had been a lot of buzz about the movie, and—being a preteen dino enthusiast— I begged my parents to take me one Saturday afternoon so I could see what everyone was talking about. When it was over, something profound had occurred. It was the first time I recall feeling an overwhelming sense of wonder at what I'd witnessed. Sure, Star Wars had blown me away as a child, and I absorbed all things Indiana Jones; but there was something about Jurassic Park that completely enveloped me. Much of this, I think, has to do with seeing it on the big screen. It wasn't only that, though; it was the seamless effects, the just-plausible- enough-to-be-believable story, and the intense action (too intense, perhaps, for some kids my age, but I ate it up with a spoon) that made it absolutely unforgettable. Thus my love of cinema was cemented forevermore.When I learned that the movie was getting the 3D treatment I groaned. The movie wasn't designed for three dimensions, and there was absolutely no way that it would make for a convincing transfer (especially when compared to films like Avatar, which were specifically tailored for the medium). I managed to resist making too much of a snap judgment and ventured out to my local theater to see the thing (with an IMAX treatment, no less) because, hey—it's Jurassic freakin' Park.Imagine my surprise when that long-lost sense of wonderment was instantly rekindled from the very first frame. When John Williams' thundering score kicked in, the outside world melted away and I was, for all intents and purposes, a kid again. But not only that; the movie lends itself nicely to 3D, with wayward tree limbs and cascading rainstorms feeling as if they were strategically placed knowing that the movie would one day be reborn in an even more tangible manner.If this wasn't confirmation enough that the movie had seen a successful transition, all I had to do was glance at the youngsters sitting a few seats down from me. I'm guessing they'd never seen the film in any iteration, as their reactions—'ooohs' and 'aaahs' in equal measure—were proof positive that this a picture perfect example of the magic of cinema. A side note: I could hardly restrain a snicker as they jolted (nearly) out of their seats when the stray velociraptor popped his head out from behind the control panel. I did the same thing when I was their age, and it's a virtual certainty that the experience—and the aforementioned sense of wonderment—will stick with them for a long, long time.So, in case I haven't been clear, go see JP 3D. If you've never seen it, then well what are you waiting for? If you've seen it at least 500 times since its original release (like me), then trust me when I say that this new iteration is well worth the money. My hope is that the move will be re-released in another 20 years so the next generation of moviegoers can see what it's like to be transported to a world where the impossible really does exist.",10,2,3,14 April 2013
The Fighter," One Round Too Many
","What would you say is the greatest boxing movie of all time? Rocky? Raging Bull? Or, as the most recent Academy Awards would indicate, the recently released hybrid blockbuster/art film The Fighter? I'll put my money on the former, but the latter is certainly a great addition to the genre.Mark Wahlberg plays Micky Ward, the little brother of former 'legend' Dicky Ward (Christian Bale). Micky is trying to make his own name in the family sport, but it's all to obvious to everyone outside of his family (with the exception of his sane father) that his brother—a crack- addict who constantly reminisces about his single moment of stardom (when he 'knocked down' Sugar Ray Leonard)—mother, and sisters are a detriment. Eventually, Micky finds a love interest in Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), a local bartender who makes an effort to liberate said boxer from the quagmire of despair and misguided devotion that he's occupied for the past ten years. As you'd expect, a push/pull brawl ensues, and Micky finds himself torn between his loyalties to his family and those advocating for his 'independence.'Much to my surprise, The Fighter—though certainly formulaic from time to time—actually takes some unexpected twists. At its heart, the success of the film falls on the shoulders of Christian Bale, who turns in a top-notch performance as a junkie who's battling his own demons. There's a refreshing sense of optimism to the narrative that does exactly what films like Aranofsky's Requiem for a Dream do not; that is, provide a tangible sense of hope. You know, the notion that it is, in fact, possible to overcome the doldrums of inner city drug use, low ambition, etc. In that respect, I have oodles of respect with what director David O. Russell and the accompanying screenwriters are able to do.But then there's the tail-end of this sprawling monster (it's only 115 minutes, but, because of the final moments, it feels much longer). Instead of wrapping things up when the conflict that's effectively fueled the story has been resolved, The Fighter feels the need to push the story into the aforementioned Rocky territory by throwing in one last 'Battle Royal' as the icing on the cake. This is disappointing, because although the movie is 'about' boxing, it really isn't (if that makes sense). Including a title match that reflects the real-life events the film is centered on creates a 'tacked-on' effect that just feelsfor lack of a better wordtrite. The impact of the resolution would have been decidedly heavyweight had The Fighter simply stuck to the good ole Freytag Pyramid and ended things when the true conflict is over and done with.Still, the movie is a success, as it's able to stand on its own two legs as a worthy addition to a long line of excellent sports films.Because of that, I heartily recommend it.",8,1,1,27 December 2012
