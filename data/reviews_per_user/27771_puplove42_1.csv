The Benchwarmers," Much better than I thought it would be
","Hands down, this is the funniest movie I've seen in a long time, which was totally unexpected. Granted you have to channel your inner 8-13 yr-old to appreciate much of the humor, but if you can't do that, you're simply not willing to enjoy life. Rob Sneider, Jon Heder, and especially David Spade and Jon Lovitz are in peak form. The story itself is completely outrageous but Adam Sandler and the cast, whose only mission in life seems to have been to cram as many adolescent jokes into eighty minutes of film as they can, which they did, somehow pull it off. The gist of the film is 'Nerds vs Bullies,' in particular bullies grown up into retentive adults, and how they get their comeuppance. If you're looking for Fellini, go elsewhere, but if you want a good laugh, see this film.",9,1,6,8 April 2006
