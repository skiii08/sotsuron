The Blair Witch Project," Scariest movie ever!!!
","Yes, this was definitely the most terrifying film I have ever seen. I had not even heard of it until my friends asked me to go last night (it was just released this weekend where I live). But now it's hard to stop thinking about it. The idea was brilliant and very original, and I love the fact that they could be so successful with such a low-budget film. I think that slasher movies like Halloween and Scream are scary, but they're different because you KNOW what it is you're afraid of. You sit on the edge of your seat while you wait for Michael Myers or some other guy in a mask w/ a knife to jump out of a dark shadow . . . but in BWP you just hear eerie noises and the thought that the three students can't find their way out of the woods, can't make their way to safety, creeps you out more than the slasher movies. The suspense, the anticipation of the unknown is the terrifying part about this movie. Although the jerkiness of the cameras gave me a little motion sickness, that was effective as well because it seemed more like you were really there than just watching a movie in a theater. I didn't know while I was watching it if it was real or not, but it didn't matter; it was scary either way. I felt for the characters: felt hopelessness, sympathy, terror, and even sadness for the way they were losing their minds and scared out of their wits. I'll admit that I was glad to find out it WASN'T real, but the movie was a real work of art. 10/10.I'd also like to say, for anyone who implies that whoever thinks this movie is scary is stupid, you are being very closed-minded. It's okay to have your opinions, to say YOU weren't scared and you didn't like the idea for BWP, but obviously a lot of people WERE scared and DID think it was a good idea, so let others have their opinions too w/o bashing them.",Null,1,1,31 July 1999
The Exorcist," very powerful overall story, but somewhat confusing at times
","The best thing I liked about this movie was that we got to see the work of God's hands, through the priests, defeat an inferior supernatural force: Satan. The scenes of Reagan when she was becoming more and more possessed by the devil are absolutely horrifying; I don't think they can ever be outdated. Those of you who don't think those scenes were scary have apparently had too many encounters with Satan yourselves and are just too used to that sort of thing! Or, maybe you just thought it seemed too fake. But that kind of thing really happens to people - maybe not the distortion of their faces and voices in such a way - but that's why there are so many evil people in the world. Anyway, I've never seen anything so scary but it was awesome watching God, the GOOD supernatural force on the other end of the spectrum, working to protect Reagan and the others in the movie. The only thing that bothered me about this movie that I couldn't get past was that the doctors who first examined her when she was starting to act 'strange' didn't seem at all horrified by the way she was acting - and more notably, by the way her voice was changing! They seemed puzzled by it, but that was about it. Only her mother seemed rightly horrified by it, and even she didn't freak out as much as I would expect a mother with a Satan-possessed child to! Other than that, the movie was excellent. A true classic that should be taken for what its message is worth.",Null,0,1,30 July 2000
Toy Story 2," GREAT!!!
","I'm a Disney fanatic anyway and loved Toy Story the original, so naturally I went into this movie knowing I would like it. Actually, I'm sort of ashamed that I waited so LONG to see it! Everyone I talked to, even people I wouldn't expect to like something like this, had said it was 'better than the original.' I don't usually like to rate Disney sequels like that, but let me just say that I LOVED TS2! I don't think it would have been nearly as good without the history of the first movie behind it, but I do think they took the story further this time and it was even more moving than the first one. The first one was about an exciting adventure, but not to the extent of the second one. I love these sorts of emotional journey/adventure movies, especially when Disney does them. The part where Jessie sings about Emily is a tear-jerker! They didn't have anything quite like that in the first Toy Story. But I do recommend that if you're going to watch TS2 for the first time (which is probably no one 'cause everyone's seen it already), that you watch the original again first to have everything fresh in your mind. There are a lot of references to it in the second movie, that won't be nearly as funny if you've forgotten those things in the first. It will maximize your enjoyment of Toy Story 2.",Null,0,1,30 July 2000
Tarzan," Great job w/ an awesome musical score
","Great animation job as always by Disney; I loved the authentic characteristics of the gorillas, the scenes in the jungle, and the other animals (the elephants were funny). Jane and her father were not very original and neither were some of the animals' personalities, but they were all likeable anyway. I want to talk about the villain next, and if you haven't seen the movie you won't want to read this yet.
The idea for the villain sort of had a new twist; for most of the movie he was just a macho, trigger-happy guy who was there to accompany the two there to study the gorillas. Usually you can tell right away who the villain in a Disney movie will be, by a certain look in their eye or a way they speak or move, but this time I was surprised. At the very beginning, when Clayton first appears, he seems like a potential villain but then I didn't think he would be, that he was really an okay guy. Although he seemed a little anxious to shoot something, I thought it was just because he was trying to look big and impress Jane -- not because he was really a bad person. But he fooled me well. I was disappointed in him but not in Disney's job on his character; I liked the way they did it.One of the best things about this movie was the music -- it was probably the best since 'The Lion King''s musical score. It is very fitting w/ the mood in the jungle.",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
