The Ring," Typical
","If you've seen 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Urban Legend,' then you do not need to waste your time with 'The Ring.'  I acknowledge that this film was originally made in Japanese well before the two films that I have just listed were made.  However, if you've seen those two films, all of the screenplay schemes in 'The Ring' will look identical.  This film had solid intentions but the plot in and of itself was its achilles heal.  It was predictable and the flash screen close-ups were the only attempts at scaring the audience.  Overall this film does not bring anything to the table that has not already been well established.",1,2,7,22 February 2003
