It," lame
","Althouh it is a good remake of first version, it doesn't follow the correct story from book. First version (1990), although without s many CGI's, managed to build and maintain suspension through all 3 ours of movie. this version is just about cheap tricks with CGI. LAME!",1,0,2,23 March 2018
Hot Fuzz," Can I give it 75?
","I don't know what to write about this movie that serves it right..... Astonishing! Everyone who watches movies can relate to this. I don't speak about directing, production or actors, because that is something that is out of question.... above that, scenario, plot and wits that is behind this cinematographic geniuosity is amazing.... At least 80% of screenplay is consisted of most famous lines from most famous thrillers, action movies even horrors, and you can't figure out from which.... There so many Easter eggs in this movie, you have to watch it three times to grasp them all... From obvious 'Bad boys 2' & 'Point Break', you will find sentences from 'The shining', 'Lethal weapon', and so many other blockbusters all merged into one original script.... Two hours of amazing comedy and action.... As oppose to new blockbusters, this IS a movie you should watch (again and again).....",10,0,1,5 April 2018
