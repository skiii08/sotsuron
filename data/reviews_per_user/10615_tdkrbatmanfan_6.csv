The Avengers," Ehhh... It's special to get all the heroes together, but besides that, there isn't anything special about it.
","7/10 A tremendous amount of hype had been built up for this film, and in Mid-April, the reviews started pouring in. There was so much raving over it saying that it was the best comic book movie ever made. They even said it was better than The Dark Knight. After I viewed it for the first time, I called shenanigans on this film.It is very slow to start. I felt very sleepy at times because things just seemed to drag on and on. The first hour is just tedious. On top of that, it's very clich√©. These guys get together, but they don't get along at all. Who could've seen it coming? Another issue is the villain. Loki just is plain uninteresting to me. He did fine in Thor, but I'm just not feeling his character in this movie. I think that Thanos is the best possible choice for a villain, and I'm pretty sure he'll be in the sequel.Now the good thing about this is that it accomplishes something never before done outside of the animated Marvel universe. The Avengers have assembled. It is great to finally see the best heroes Marvel has to offer being showcased together on the big screen. Very nice. However, you would think with the complexity it took to get these fellas together, the plot would have complexity. No, the idea behind the film is all too simple. Just another alien invasion.On the whole, it really isn't bad at all. It just isn't anything excellent. The fact that this gets compared to The Dark Knight is really upsetting. This to me, is just another average team-up flick.",7,1,5,22 June 2012
Batman Returns," Can't believe I thought this was the worst one
","My buddy and I always loved Batman. We used to rent the animated series all the time. He owned the first one and I owned the second one. We loved all four but this one not so much. I watched it four nights ago and it was fantastic. I was blown away by how good it was. The Penguin is played very well by Danny DeVito, Catwoman/Selina Kyle was played to perfection, and Anne Hathaway will not top it.The plot is better than the original, because it is a better idea. The penguin wants to get into the world and meet his parents. He chooses the wrong person to get him into it, Max Schreck. Schreck creates a corrupt version of the Penguin.Christopher Walken played Max Schreck to perfection, but his son was an annoying little prick. And the carnival gang always creeped me out, and still does.Overall, not as good as the original, as it is less entertaining, but more thought out. This one is the last one before the murder of the series.",8,8,21,11 July 2011
Batman Begins," Used to hate it. I was stupid
","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The past five nights I've started a marathon of watching Batman movies. I started with the 1989 classic, Batman, and so forth. Tonight I watched Batman Begins, and was blown away. It was so well written, and so well done. I just loved it. Katie Holmes was good, Michael Caine was good, but he was no Michael Gough. As for Christian Bale... I didn't like him. The plot keeps one guessing, and is complex. The plot in this and The Dark Knight are much more adult-like than in the original series, which i think makes for a better more interesting movie. Liam Neeson is excellent in his role. It was nice to see Ra's Al Ghul brought to the big screen. I used to not like it because it was hard to understand for me, but now i realize the plot is just so well put together. I also thought it was boring, but it's really not boring at all. I recommend this to any fan of Batman, and any fan of movies in general. The Dark Knight I believe is a better movie, but this is still good. Not just good, it's great!",10,1,2,11 July 2011
JFK," JFK makes great points
","Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. Good quote from JFK, who is the center of this film. The movie was just excellent. Very good and very interesting. The point it makes is just excellent. The evidence i believe is indisputable. Watch it. See it when you get the chance to. It is a great movie! Tommy Lee Jones was excellent as the part of Clay Shaw/ Clay Bertrand. Kevin Costner wasn't superb, but it wasn't awful. I did like most of the acting, and the newsreels were a cool thing. Just an excellent film all around. Stone impressed me with this one, but he didn't impress me with platoon. Watching Nixon Tonight. I hope it's good",10,1,8,23 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Feel free to disagree, but this is the best of the trilogy.
","While i really would like to give it an 11, IMDb only goes up to 10. This is the best superhero movie ever made, and I really can't find words to explain how I feel about this movie. I had hyped this movie up for four years now. I'd been on this page ever since the untitled batman 3 project days, and it's great to see my dream movie come to the big screens.I'll start with the running time. It is very well-paced for a nearly 3- hour movie. It brisked right by, and I never found it to be boring. Some might argue that the first hour drags, but I find it to be very interesting, and a great start, especially the plane hijacking sequence.While I loved The Dark Knight as much as the next guy, this one tops it in nearly every way. Christian Bale in my opinion used to only pull off the Bruce Wayne role in a superb way, but this time around, he gave his everything and he was a great Batman. Actually, he was more than great, I just can't find a word to describe his Batman performance. Anne Hathaway proved the naysayers so wrong with her performance as Selena Kyle. She was attractive, and quite the femme fatale. Michael Caine gave an emotionally gripping performance as the faithful butler Alfred. I was impressed with him. Now the character everyone is wondering about is Tom Hardy as Bane. The only way to describe him and his character is this: Bane is a MENACE. I have never been more terrified of a movie villain, not even in a horror flick. However, this is where I think The Dark Knight tops Rises. The Joker is a much more interesting character. I liked Heath Ledger better as he provided a more interesting villain, But he is a bit more light- hearted compared to Bane. Bane is an absolute brutal terrorist. For the most part, I understood everything Bane said. Tom Hardy really did do a great job of portraying Bane,and it makes Batman & Robin even worse.So to conclude, this is the best one of the trilogy. The performances are something to brag about for the actors. Bane is going to go down as a great movie villain, but not as great as Heath Ledger's Joker, which is an inevitable comparison. The Dark Knight Rises looks the avengers look worse than it is(I give Avengers 7/10) and it owns the summer movies as it is the best superhero movie ever made, and possibly the best movie ever made. Yes, that good.",10,4,10,20 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A bit forced at times, but BvS tells an emotional and gripping story.
","Before I express my thoughts and reaction to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, I want to say a few things regarding its reception thus far. Critics have unfairly bagged on this movie for not being 'fun' and being too 'serious.' Basically, not enough like Marvel, which most reviewers can't stop mentioning. However, the film was never marketed to be like Marvel and was never marketed to be anything less than very serious and very dark. Also, I have an extreme bias towards DC so take what you will from my thoughts. So with that being said, go in with the expectation of a dark, serious story and BvS will be pretty easy to enjoy. Batman v Superman tells the story of a Superman who believes he is misunderstood because every good deed he does brings around more controversy. In Gotham City, Bruce Wayne feels distrust towards Superman following the destruction of Metropolis in Man of Steel and views it as a personal mission to end Superman. And Lex Luthor clearly has a hand in pinning the two against each other. The motivation behind every character's actions is extremely well thought out and actually makes a lot of sense unlike certain parts of Man of Steel. The movie really sells why the two are fighting and definitely gives emotional appeals as to who to side with. Is Superman really just misunderstood, or is he a danger? Also, the movie really takes time to develop the controversy surrounding Superman and does an excellent job of resolving the criticisms of Man of Steel. Now, back in 2013 when Ben Affleck was cast as Batman, the Internet exploded with rage. Well I can definitely say he's the best live-screen Batman to date. This Batman is brutal, absolutely brutal. Henry Cavill makes an improvement from his wooden acting in Man of Steel to deliver a more conflicted Superman wondering if he's doing any good or wasting his time. Gal Gadot makes for a pleasant surprise as Wonder Woman and has an amazing part in the finale. My personal favorite, however, was the one casting choice I could not forgive. When Jesse Eisenberg was cast as Lex, I couldn't believe it. But he nailed it. Easily the best character of the movie for me, wonderful villain. However, the film had flaws. It feels really long and perhaps has a subplot too many. The titular fight really underwhelmed me and I was hoping for more. Some of the editing was a little off. My biggest complaint would be the forced cameos of the Justice League. At times, the movie feels like a teaser for what's to come which distracts from the central story, making the movie feel disconnected. So overall, Batman v Superman improves on Man of Steel because it actually takes the time to care about the themes it's exploring, but it's not without its flaws. 8.5/10.",9,9,16,26 March 2016
