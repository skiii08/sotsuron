Catch Me If You Can," Walken is amazing
","This movie is a good change for Speilberg, because unlike his last two movies it is actually good.  Not just parts, or up until a moment when he screws it up; Catch Me... is enjoyable all the way through.  What really makes the film is Christopher Walken.  He has given many great performances, but he really steals the movie.  Envoking so much humanity into his character...wow!  He's going to get an Oscar nominaton and maybe this year the judges aren't smoking crack and he'll win.",8,1,2,6 January 2003
Snatch," Wants to be hip too much.
","Snatch is escapism.  It is a movie that does not invest in it's characters, and it tries to be ultra hip.  If you like that sort of thing then see it. If you don't I think you should see 'Sexy Beast' or the original 'Get Carter.'  Both great British Gangster films.",1,22,69,18 December 2001
