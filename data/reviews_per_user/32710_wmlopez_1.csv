Blade Runner 2049," Beautiful and boring
",Beautiful to look at but a complete boring movie. Movie is too long should have been a 90 minute movie instead of over 2 hours. A lot of boring useless scenes. The acting performances are very good and the cinematography is just beautiful. The music score is good and uses some of the old cues from the first movie. I would wait for DVD rental.,5,30,67,6 October 2017
