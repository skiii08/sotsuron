The Avengers," The most ambitious comic book film of all time, and that ambition paid off... THE BEST EVER!
","Avengers was the most ambitious comic book film of all time, and that ambition paid off. It's NOW the best comic book film of all time bar none. No one involved in this production seemed to take anything for granted. Everyone (actors, FX people, writers, director, etc.) all brought their A-game. It truly is the gem they had promised and truly is a worthy holder of the crown.Joss managed to reintroduce characters that we all love, make them seem fresh, make them seem new, and then having them all together without weighting any particular character more than the other. He's the master! My favorite critic quote that points this out: 'The result is a kitchen sink movie that doesn't feel confused or messy. It's a genuinely thrilling spectacle with just the right amount of depth, laughs, humanity and maybe a few more explosions for good measure.' I can't wait to see this over and over and over again.",10,2,6,17 May 2012
Mission: Impossible III," Hope This Is The Last One
","The third and hopefully final 'Mission Impossible' is so unoriginal and so uneven that it's more like 'Mission To Not Be Nauseous: Impossible.' Even the trademark James Bondian moments are borderline dull. JJ proves himself to be a spastic, hack director who can't leave the camera alone. I was nearly nauseated by the early constant camera cuts. Did anyone else notice the annoying cuts and useless zooms during the house party scene? No character was on screen for more then three seconds before JJ cut to something else. (Even shots of the dog). Oh, and the dialogue is stiffly Shatnerian.Viewed only in the context of the big, stupid FX film that it is, the movie has its moments. The action isn't better than it was in MI2 but it's still mindless all the same. The meandering fortune cookie dialogue does get in the way quite often.",3,1,2,29 May 2006
Iron Man 2," Robert Downey Jr. Enters Legendary Territory With This Gem
","It's clear that Robert Downey Jr. was born to play the part of Tony Stark. As he did the first time around, he portrays the perfect combination of suave and selfishness, energy and ungoverned gluttony, troubled spirit and a soul seeking redemption and responsibility. It's clear that Downey has brought everything to the part. This movie is about Stark's spiritual growth. He's certainly bitten off more than he can chew mostly because of his proclamation to end the last film. He's way overextended himself and now everything is crashing down around him. He really has to dig down deep and that's the mark of a true hero. How can the awards people keep overlooking this part? RDJ as Tony Stark is now the stuff of legend. Think Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal. Pacino as Michael Corleone. Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Clark Gable as Rhett Butler. Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry. John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn. Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone.Tony Stark isn't a mutant or a ninja or nothing silly has happened to him. Stark isn't a cheesy, tights wearing superhero. It's great that he can't jump into a phone booth and be on his cheesy way. He's a flawed man but he's anything but ordinary. This sequel perfectly picks up where the first film left off. Every step of the way is believable and incredibly interesting. All of the amazing effects are grounded in realism. I know they built the Iron Man armor and War Machine armor in real life and mixed it flawlessly with CG. It wasn't all a CG mishmash and all of it plays out in stunning fashion. There was a realism to everything. Using practical effects and a practical suit of armor paid off big-time. I seriously enjoyed not being able to tell the difference between a CG shot and a practical shot. The suits of armor develop a personality of their own. They communicate and allows us to see certain POV. Even the drones were amazing. There are so many great details that I truly believe this movie will be king of the multiple viewings. I can't see myself ever tiring of the action or performances.",10,10,20,2 May 2010
Creed," I was moved AND inspired! Great Rocky Tribute.
","Growing up on the Rocky movies, this film really hits the mark. The set up and even the ending does feel like a 'paint by the numbers' type of effort but it totally works. Where it really excels is the emotional connection felt and utilized during the heart of the film and meat of the story. A majority of the emotional impact stems from paying off what we already know about the character of Rocky Balboa but it feels earned and right in place with the current story arc. I was moved and I was inspired, which is EXACTLY what should happen when depicting the swan song of a legendary character. Rocky feels like family because we've taken this ride, his life's journey, with him on screen. So, fans will truly connect with this effort far more than those unfamiliar with Rocky. Make no mistake, this is Creed's movie but, for me, the film rose to the realm of extraordinary because of Rocky's continuing life struggles. Overall, a wonderfully filmed and written movie that leaves things perfectly in place. I truly hope there are no sequels for Creed and that the line that ended the first Rocky actually comes in to play now. 'There ain't gonna be no rematch. Don't want one.'",9,1,4,2 December 2015
Just Go with It," Perfect Embodiment of a NICE Movie
","Adam Sandler's last few movie efforts were a tough way to spend a couple of hours. This is the exact opposite, delivering quite a few pleasant and amusing moments. I'd call this film the perfect embodiment of a 'nice' movie. Nothing extraordinary or laugh out loud funny but the number of chuckles and amusing situations do add up. It has heart and characters that are genuine and likable. Sure, some of the decisions Sandler's character makes defy logic and even common sense but who goes to his films seeking reason and logic? Sitcom type situations hammered in to the film somehow works with this cast. The one level where the film operates above the 'nice' or average range is on the superficial but enjoyable girl watching level. Yes, film fans often rave about breathtaking cinematography but I can't say I've seen any sunset or landscape shot that rivals the shear beauty of watching Brooklyn Decker glide across screen in slow motion. Add Jennifer Aniston in various tight outfits and in a 'Hula-off' with Nicole Kidman and the babe factor is as elevated as can be. Again, an enjoyable way to spend a few hours.",7,3,6,17 February 2011
Captain America: Civil War," Superb Film That's Fun Yet Textured and Intelligent!
","This movie is simply amazing. I was worried that I was expecting too much but this easily fulfilled and then exceeded all my already lofty expectations. I just loved it. The action sequences are spectacular and the story-line keeps you riveted from start to finish. The first act grabs you and eventually drops your jaw right to the floor. From there, the story has you and it's one big roller coaster ride to the heart rendering finish. I honestly believe movies like this are exactly what the cinema is for... a well structured and smart thrill ride.I have a feeling that the writing and intelligence of this film is going to surprise those that don't know any better. They think this must be a silly 'comic book' film and don't realize that the comics are indeed deep, textured and intelligent. This is everything that is complex and cherished in years of quality comic book runs.Thank God literally that we all get to watch something this good.",10,16,34,26 April 2016
X-Men: The Last Stand," just plain spectacular (A+)
","It's not just that this movie, directed by Brett Ratner believe it or not, is more chockablock with eye-popping effects and thrilling action sequences than the first two, though that's true. Nor that Ratner depicts more mutant super-powers, though that's true also. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here. 'X3' starts fast, and springboards from the long-running Marvel Comics series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with the phrase 'summer movie.' For good reason, we equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action. But the writers here seem less interested in the action than the subtext: the effort by a high-handed majority to control and eradicate a minority it finds undesirable. The script examines the other side of that equation as well: the desire to strike back, to return hatred for hatred. Magneto, who believes that the mutants, rather than submit to discrimination or attempt peaceful coexistence, should use their powers to rise up and rule over humans. Not that this is a movie with a lot of touchy-feely talks about brotherhood. It's just that 'X3' has more on its mind than super-powered butt-kicking. Still, there's no denying that those super-powers drive this film. This is what state-of-the-art special effects look like: the live-action version of the way comic books appear in your mind. That would be irrelevant, however, without a good story. But 'X3''s script delivers, skillfully weaving together character, plot and action. This movie and the action is just plain spectacular.",8,53,102,29 May 2006
Thor," Thor is exceptional because its an adaptation that does it with utter belief in the story and with the best talent and FX possible.
","WOW! No wonder all the big time critics love this movie (Ebert, Roeper, Joyce Kulhawik. etc) It's amazing! I can't wait to see it again! Two thumbs up from me too! Thor is a magnificent thrill ride that even the most cynical viewer or critic will find something to enjoy. That's why even the jaded or cynical critics wanting to hate on yet 'another comic book film' can't bring themselves to hate it. Those watching with an open mind will absolutely adore this film. Once seen, it's easy to see why critics are basically in agreement regardless of their previous dispossession.If you're going to turn a comic book into a movie, do it with utter belief in your story and do it with the best talent and FX possible. That's why Marvel rules the cinema and why they need to get ALL their properties back under their roof. Come on Disney, spend that cash and reunite the Marvel Universe! Avengers will be great but imagine if Spider-Man and Wolverine pop in to join Thor and company in Avengers 4!!!!!! Yet, Even in an era when an explosion of comic-book properties are hitting the big screen, Thor stands alone. This has little to do with an individual who utilizes special powers and everything to do with your typical Marvel hero. It's the classic Marvel style with a great twist, a hero with flaws and awesome spectacles everywhere you look. You must see this flick!",10,28,52,3 May 2011
The Wolf of Wall Street," Excess living depicted through excess film making... Over-hyped Film
","Where to begin with this one? There's no question that the events depicted are fascinating and that Scorsese is a superb director. There are actually a few laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled throughout this film. Still, the movie is three hours long and, at times, feels that way. I kept expecting it to end half hour before it actually did. As has been noted everywhere, there is absolutely no one to root for or like during this entire running time. However, the performances are all quite good. You don't see many Oscar contenders like Leo get nominated for a film in which a candle appears in his ass. On that note, so much of this film focuses on the extremely vulgar and extremely decedent living. That certainly was the point but is it possible to drive home that point too much? Excess living depicted through excess film making? One thing's for sure, this is NOT a film to take your parents or grandparents to.",7,11,20,14 January 2014
Dark Shadows," Just Awful On Every Level
","Angelique dooms Johnny Depp to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then placing him in one of the worst movies I've ever sat through. This is just awful. I'm talking Speed Racer or Battlefield Earth awful. Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family are more annoying than a dozen nails grating across a chalkboard. To make a vampire analogy, this is one Depp/Burton movie that should have NEVER seen the light of day. It's terribly paced, not funny and not interesting. Other then that...",2,11,22,17 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Old School Popcorn Fun
","This is indeed the best Star Wars movie since 1983. Given the low quality of the prequels, that's not saying a whole lot. Still, the old school Star Wars flavor is here as is the popcorn fun. Maybe sentiment is carrying this rating but how many franchises have earned that right? Overall, I was disappointed with the shallowness of everything on display and the lack of story itself. You expect some cheese with this franchise and that was fine. What I didn't like was the predictability. There is nothing most smart movie goers can't see coming a mile away. That truly lessens the emotional impact certain scenes should have delivered. I know they had a lot of ground to cover given the 30 year gap in story but they sacrificed quite a bit in terms of development and depth. I was also disappointed that certain original characters never got to appear on screen together. I did really like the new characters of Finn and Rey. Relationships felt forced and instant but that particular contrivance is easily overlooked... some other plot contrivances, not so much. Despite being mostly shallow, they did enough right introducing the two new leads and capitalizing on the original trilogy that I very much care about what comes next. That alone means this is a successful reboot to a worthwhile franchise.",8,1,10,18 December 2015
