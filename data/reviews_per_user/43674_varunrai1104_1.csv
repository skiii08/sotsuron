Iron Man 3," 1 time watch
","I expect more than that. Weak on plot. special effects are brilliant. Tony Stark as usual brilliant.Iron Man 1 & 2 are far better than this as those movies have story to tell. Action is not up to the mark as this movie consider to be a action movie, as what they shown in the trailer. The twist was a insult. The trailer built up a bad guy named, The Mandarin, who wants to watch the west burn.He ends up saying he is an theater actor. WOW!! How funny is this.Maybe this is the last Iron Man Movie, so go for this movie with very low expectations and you'll be pleased. Just thinking what kind of Iron Man they going to show in Avengers 2 as Tony Stark has been cured. But still waiting for Avengers 2.",7,5,11,27 April 2013
