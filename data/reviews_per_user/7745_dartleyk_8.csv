The Benchwarmers," terrible PC message
","masquerading as harmless fun with SNL retreads, some comic scenes are obliterated by a final message, i.e. the worst losers can pretend to be winners if their opponents bend over backwards to arrange it; it's not everyone's a winner, it's not non-competitive summer camp with absurd games- as if kids don't know who is fast and who is slow, who can catch and who can't; and it's even beyond gump where serendipitous events conspire to arrange success; dreadful message is you can win if everyone else makes sure that they lose; geez- and the senior losers all get hot blondes in the end; right; there is no saving grace, no silver lining, and who knows why IMDb insists that any review must be ten lines long",1,0,1,14 June 2015
Full Metal Jacket," hard to rate
","the first 30 minutes of boot camp are brilliant: concise, stunningly edited, swept forward by an immaculate performance by novice r. lee erme; the tightness of the action and dialogue blows away mediocre camera work; there are no David lean moments; but hard to rate because once they are in country, modine turns smart ass, and full-bird colonels turn into idiotic, overage morons who look as though they have never picked up a shovel much less a rifle, i.e. it gets anti-war preachy with way too much tongue in cheek; after that,for me, it's downhill, despite some well done fights; lost its initial tightness and clarity; i'd give that first part a 10 no problem, the way too snarky follow-on a 4",7,1,3,11 October 2012
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," elephant in the room
","a potentially good movie; nice quiet performance by pitt, carried by getting more from blanchette, misused and underused ormond, nicely shot, seems quite promising- except for the elephant that keeps charging into the room- the reverse age thing; you have to buy, or overlook, the premise of reverse aging, but then they keep hitting you with it in the wrong ways- like he starts as a 4'8' cripple who reverse ages to a 6-foot paragon; old people do sometimes shrink an inch or two, but not a foot or two; there are too many times when pitt is supposedly 10 years younger, but shown with a more furrowed brow, and blanchette is 20 years older and not a wrinkle; it's a though the continuity girl lost it- the one on the set who is supposed to see that when the cigarette has burned down to the filter, the close-up takes don't show it freshly lit; also suffers from been there done that, a la dorian gray and others; and the conundrum of a baby dying by becoming younger? as though unborn is dying? doesn't quite work metaphysically; so as you get hooked in, an usual love story, through the ages, even backwards, the movie keeps hitting you with implausible and impossible conditions instead of brushing them aside and keeping the story and your attention on track",6,1,1,21 October 2012
The Godfather: Part III," sequel disaster
","amazing that this gets a 7.6 overall- maybe ion homage to the first two, and the strange idea that coppola could make probably the best sequel ever made (godfather 2) and then one of the worst; and to be fair, public word is that the director was experiencing some very difficult times, but still, among the problems; the plot is basically ludicrous; some of the acting as well; shire has decided to act with hand movements, two out here, two out there as no one you have ever scene gesticulate as they talk; the son has no stage presence; the daughter is about as non photogenic as you can get yet playing the most desirable girl; and think of the family taken over by michael, now taken over by a loudmouth, wiseass, leather jacket andy garcia? hello? the best parts, of course, are flashbacks; advice is watch 1+2, which are stunners, and make up your own conclusion to the sage; it will be more interesting",2,1,3,26 January 2014
A Beautiful Mind," too schizoid
","an interesting, offbeat subject; crowe good but i found too much the blubblering; reminded me of derek jacoby overdoing claudius; we get that he's an antisocial math genius, and that story line would have been more interesting with more quirkiness- like the great scene where he asks his date to name anything, then finds it in the stars; fanciful but wonderful; so in a way it's a solid 8, except for a major flaw, i.e. that too much of what's shown as real isn't; if you don't pick up on that it's given about 1:20 into the movie, but by then you're wondering if that is being imagined, too; is it only characters present when he's present? there is exactly the same level of detail in the schizoid scenes as the real scenes- and that's not the way paranoid schizophrenia works, aside from confusing what's real and imagined; point is it's too much like movies that late in the game show that it's all a dream; minor role but very nice and unaffected jennifer connoly",6,1,2,3 January 2014
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," brilliant and difficult
","an iconoclastic book crafted into a brilliant but difficult movie; obvious cudos to nicholson (back when he was acting), screenplay, direction; shooting is average; oddly, was recently shown (nov '12) on tcm as part of their series on handicapped, disability in film; the strange take being that films showing demented people (or crippled people, or otherwise disabled people) are somehow off, not true, not up to par; the PC culture reigns supreme- even, according to tcm, for movies set in the 17th century, like bedlam; as though best years of our lives should not have shown homer with no hands- even though the book it's from showed him with a horrible series of much more disturbing problems; so if you approach the movie with that PC view in mind it's so flawed; on the other hand it's a tight look at the individual versus the system, the loner versus the crowd, what you think you should do even when everyone says you should not; the late 60's-early 70's message, unfortunately, is that you lose- as though it presages the coming of the nanny state, the transposing of jfk's what you can do for your country to obama's what can your country do for you;though there are many movies about asylums and dementia, this one stays almost till the end on the edge of sane or not; that's what makes it interesting",9,3,4,30 October 2012
Stalag 17," her's why wildly overrated
","in bridges at toko-ri, word is holden took the role only on condition that Hollywood wouldn't clean up the blistering ending and save him; if only someone had injected that grit into stalag 17; holden tries to; very good performance, edgy, intelligent, cynical; but it's downhill from there despite billy wilder; way too much of the movie centers on a duffus zero mostel wannabe who dances, clowns, dresses up and such with his pals; there is more than one very long dance sequence; problem being that every time holden build some edge, tension, even develops the very slow plot, in comes a new prisoner who does impressions of cary grant, ho ho ho- and we're talking gilligan's island level of comedy; again and again it kills holden's sharpness; a split personality movie; about 1/3 is very good, edgy, intriguing; 2/3 is a hogan's heroes without the laugh track; a nod to neville brand playing neville brand as he always did; preminger as commandant way over the top; watch this and it seems likely that wilder was more often put over the top by actor's performances than his script or direction; camera in stalag is basically filming a stage play; like the genre? grand illusion is edgy, poignant, funny parts, puts this one to shame",4,7,13,8 February 2014
The Ringer," bizarre in a PC world
","a la forest gump, and PC summer camps with 'non-competitive' games where everyone wins, this movie accepts the idea that even them most disadvantaged (that's PC) are basically just like us; the hero, not really, bridges the gap as he is not stupid or awkward or particularly funny looking but acts that way; yes, it's akin to jerry lewis aping MS patients, but somehow OK; of course, the hero-con man has the hots for a blonde babe who oversees the special olympic program, unlike the others he acts like who don't know a babe from the phone book; why a 5? because it is an utterly low-life, bottom of the barrel movie that has poked a hole, albeit unwittingly, in today's astonishingly, I feel so much better, PC culture",5,0,0,6 September 2012
