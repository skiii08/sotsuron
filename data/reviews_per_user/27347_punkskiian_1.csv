Kill Bill: Vol. 2," This movie rocked my socks off! (SPOILERS)
","Kill Bill Volume 2 is utterly incredible.  It creates this perfectly balanced 'yin-yang' effect with Volume 1. I would suggest buying into 'The Man's' sleazy marketing scheme and renting and watching Kill Bill 1 before seeing Kill Bill 2 just so you can get the full effect.  While Volume 1 focuses almost entirely on the Bride's (AKA Beatrix Kiddo--'Silly rabbit TRIX are for KIDs') invincible, natural born killer nature, Volume 2 tones it down a bit to show a much more human, survival-oriented, and even motherly side of her.  In fact, the only person she ends up killing in Volume 2 is Bill himself, and even that is a very emotional scene.  Volume 2 takes a look at how she got to be the world's deadliest woman, while simultaneously focusing on her following through to the end of her journey. As you might know if you paid attention to the end of Volume 1, her child is still alive, and that adds a whole new element to the story.  I found both volumes of Kill Bill to be tremendously engrossing and beautifully well done--I give Volume 2 a 10/10.",10,0,1,18 April 2004
