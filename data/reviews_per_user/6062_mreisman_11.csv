Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just plain bad
","Being a 27-year-old whose first impressions of great, exciting filmmaking were largely shaped by the first trilogy, I can honestly (and sadly) say 'The Phantom Menace' does not fit among them.  I could spend hours dissecting the individually poor decisions made in the scripting and directing of this film (from the very first confusing, hastily edited 'trade negotiation' scene all the way to the accidental heroism of Anakin and Jar Jar), but the only thing that seems to matter now is that I never felt that I was involved in the action or emotionally invested in any of the characters.  And isn't that why we go to see movies -- to be gripped by a story about people we can identify with?Now I know that many people did enjoy this film, and I'm not  going to deny that, or try to prove that these feelings are somehow less legitimate than mine.  But I hope that people understand that glossy CG effects do not make up for sloppiness in writing and directing.Even the best 'kid's movies', such as Babe, Toy Story, Antz and The Little Mermaid can appeal to adults, but this film was aimed directly at children, to the exclusion of a thinking, mature audience, and one, coincidentally, who has been waiting 16 years for this film.I can only pray that Lucas -- who has stated that he made this movie for his own children -- will realize the error of his ways, and will concentrate on thoughtful story, dialogue, editing and acting in the next two Episodes.",1,3,6,4 June 1999
Training Day," More plot holes than bullet holes
","I'm not really sure what the point of this movie was, other than to look cool and to give Denzel a badass persona with which to chew the scenery. The characters make reference to the 'chess game' going on between them, but it's really a game of kick the can.  They only manage to keep it moving forward one hour, at which point it just could becomes a big checkers endgame, full of black-leather gold-chain-danglin' fury, signifying nothing. This movie pistol whips you with countless racial stereotypes, and F's you up with an anticlimactic, silly ending that would be satisfying only after a hit of PCP-laced dope.  The friends who recommended this to me ought get their own special brand of 'street justice'.  Garbage.",6,35,72,23 February 2003
Lost in Translation," Disappointing
","I was seriously disappointed by Lost in Translation.  Every critic LOVED this, but absolutely nothing happens.  Well, that's not entirely true: every once in a while, a Japanese person does something so unbelievably wacky and nonsensical that it strikes you as cheap if not outright racist.  As a storyteller Coppola has nothing interesting to say and takes two hours to say it.  I'm a huge Bill Murray fan and I thought it was mostly a waste of his talents, and a waste of time.L.I.T. is a good example of a film that is praised as an insightful 'character study' yet it told me very little about the characters.  There's a lot of meaningful stares and longing looks, but we don't really get to know who these people are, because the movie is so light on details that actually matter, so light on action, and so preoccupied with its mood.  Of course 'action' can manifest itself in many ways, and the importance of an action may seem small but may be set up to have dire consequences.  In this movie, for example, the act of simply knocking on a hotel door, or of sending your husband carpet swatches, are filled with more meaning than they would be in any other movie.  Those moments were good.  But it also had so much filler, including many meaningless, wordless minutes of sightseeing and lying around, and the aforementioned 'aren't those Japanese wacky' moments, and a long, long scene where they sing Karaoke.  For me it wasn't nearly enough. I don't need (or even want) a formulaic Hollywood story, but a good movie goes somewhere, and build in some way to something.  For a highly praised art film, I was just surprised at how ultimately insignificant L.I.T. was. 3/10.",3,1,2,17 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lower Your Expectations
","Episode II is better than Episode I, like getting an enema is better than getting disemboweled.  Again, Lucas has given us a half-hearted attempt at a real motion picture, a galaxy far, far away from the original trilogy.  This film looks like a low budget production of a string of unrehearsed first takes, shot with the script's first draft, edited together hastily, and layered with $125M of state of the art digital effects.  We should all expect more from our entertainment.",1,0,1,24 May 2002
Being John Malkovich," Very good, but not exactly uplifting
","Let me start off by saying 'Being John Malkovich' IS a very good movie. It's one of the most interesting, unusual and thought-provoking films I've seen this year. I still can't believe Malkovich himself agreed to star in it, and I still have the sublimely ridiculous themes and surreal images I saw a week ago in my head. The acting is solid, the directing is good, the writing is sharp and the story is compelling.So why wasn't I wholly satisfied by this movie? Why do I feel now, as I did when the credits were rolling, that something was missing, and that this work is overrated? Well, having some distance, I think I've figured it out. It has to do with sympathy for the characters. Basically, I didn't have any.Each character is flawed to such a degree, through greed, selfishness, and insecurity, that he/she ultimately comes off as a two-dimensional puppet. I found it impossible to put myself in anyone's shoes, ironically, because none of them are comfortable in their own. The characters who succeed are the ones who are the most adept at using and abusing the other characters, and, of course, at abusing the body of John Malkovich. Catherine Keener's character makes a point in the film about how there are those who 'take what they want, and then there's everybody else' (I'm paraphrasing). That point is explored in the film, but ultimately, the message (and I only mention this because the film does have philosophical aims) becomes 'It's a dog-eat-dog world out there'.  There is no love, no moral anchor.  And that's why, despite its very clear style and simple but intriguing plot, I couldn't totally get into it.The characters go through changes which are wholly believable and uplifting. Rent it.",8,0,0,8 November 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Good, not great
","If you're looking for a good kung-fu action pic with some elements of story and character development which you don't normally find in a kung-fu action pic, see Crouching Tiger.  But if you're expecting a great story, you may be disappointed.  The fight scenes are definitely spectactular, and the much-heralded bending of the laws of gravity is neat (if overused), but DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO BE AN EMOTIONALLY INVOLVING MOVIE.  It's just not.  The acting is good, but the story does not let you into the minds of any of these characters.  The one exception is the 20-30 minute Flashback In The Desert, where young Jen resists and eventually falls in love with the roguish loner guy.  That was compelling storytelling.  But essentially there's not much else to the story.  I didn't buy the romance between Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat, and without spoiling the ending, I think that this storyline, and the whole movie, ended quite unsatisfyingly.  Maybe certain things don't translate from East to West very well, but I couldn't help but think that this is yet another lesson in Don't Believe The Hype.  8 out of 10.",8,0,0,23 February 2001
Groundhog Day," Bill Murray at his best
","I've always liked Bill Murray, especially as the egotistical-but-lovable guy he plays in just about everything he's ever done (but most notably, in Meatballs, Stripes and Ghostbusters).  But he takes it to a higher level in Harold Ramis' 'Groundhog Day,' owing to a fantastic script which perfectly executes the story's clever premise, and makes perfect use of the Lovable Jerk persona as a springboard for a real character-driven story.  I can't imagine the movie being done with another actor in the lead role, and that is, I think, one of the more remarkable things about it.  Everything, including the casting, fits together so well.The premise of living out the same day over and over again is a very 'high' concept, but ironically, the story works because the characters are so believable.  Not many comedies would have its hero try to commit suicide over and over again, only to wake up alive, saying, 'Ah, nuts.'Even the usually unbearably bland Andie Macdowell is a three-dimensional, charming and believable foil/love interest.  I credit Ramis and Murray for bringing out the best in her.  While I'm being superlative, let me go on record to say that the film's big comic payoff, when Phil tries to get Rita (Macdowell) into bed through what must be months of conversational scheming, is one of the funniest 15 minutes in film history.I would call this the most underrated comedy of the 90's, if it wasn't on TV so damn much.  But I watch it every time it is, and I still marvel at how close it is to perfection.",9,0,0,8 May 2000
The Green Mile," Too Long
","This is clearly a well-made movie, with good intentions, but it's easily an hour too long.  You could actually read most of the book in three hours. And with the ample lighting provided by people checking their Indiglo Watches, you could actually do it in the theatre.  If there were more to uncover about the characters in the story, I might have better tolerated the length.  But I don't know any more about these people than I did in the first 15 seconds in which they were introduced.  They are either Very Good, or Very, Very, Insanely, Ridiculously Bad.  Admittedly, Stephen King has never been the master of character depth, but he has never been this predictable.  You don't need to go farther than John Coffey's initials to tell you what's going to happen to him.   Props to Michael Duncan and Michael Jeter for powerful commitment to their one-dimensional roles.",Null,1,2,3 April 2000
Shrek," Don't have kids? Don't bother
","I really expected greatness from Shrek, so perhaps I'm not the best person to give a review.  On the other hand, I'm sure I'm not the only one who's read the overwhelmingly glowing reviews from the media.  So for those of you who expect Shrek to be an unparalleled triumph, be forewarned: it's not. It's just a good movie to take your kids to.The animation is undeniably sophisticated and sharp, but you can't last 90 minutes on technique.  There needs to be a good story.  The story of Shrek does expand on William Steig's 32-page children's story, but not enough to warrant the length.  Take away the pokes at fairy-tale conventions and pot-shots at Disney, take away the (often very funny) wisecracking Eddie Murphy as the Donkey, and it boils down to a 15 minute hero-rescues-the-princess plot.Having said that, I wasn't really ever bored watching it.  I just thought with all the time and effort they spent on the visuals, they could have taken more care to make it a more interesting story.  It doesn't hold an ear-wax candle to Toy Story 2 and Chicken Run.",Null,0,1,21 May 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," A lot of fun!
","Saw this one on the plane (which, by its inescapability, could make a bad movie seem worse, and a good one transcendant), and loved it.  It is funny, the way a cartoon should be, in the Chuck Jones style.  Witty, fast-paced, and with a heart.  See it with your buddies, young or old.",8,1,2,8 August 2001
Before Sunrise," Great
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I don't think I could ever get tired of it or not be moved by some part of it.  The story is so simple, but I've never seen or heard of another movie like it -- a document of two people meeting on a train in Europe, deciding to spend the day with each other and falling in love.  There's a line in the movie which goes:I believe if there's any kind of God, it wouldn't be in any of us.  Not you, or me... but just this little space in between. If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something. I know, its almost impossible to succeed, but... who cares, really? The answer must be in the attempt.The movie is filled with intelligent lines like this between two intelligent, likable, complicated, confused people, just contemplating life and each other, which just hit me with their truth and beauty.  It sounds cornball, I know.  Ultimately, Before Sunrise may be nothing if not a test of how sappily romantic you are.  But I think objectively it succeeds because it walks the line so artfully between realism and romanticism, and I think you have to be a little bit of both to like it:  knowing how unlikely it is for a stranger on a train to change your life, but allowing for the possibility, and rooting for people who take it when it comes.There's a voyeuristic element to the film, like My Dinner With Andres, or a documentary, where you're just listening to people talking, and it wouldn't be anything worth mentioning if it weren't so beautifully written, and completely believable.  I normally don't like Ethan Hawke, but he's very good in this.  And if you're a red-blooded male, you have no choice but to fall in love with Julie Delpy.  A must see.",10,7,12,23 April 2001
