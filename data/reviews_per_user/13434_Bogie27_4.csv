Vertigo," A dizzying Achievement
","A down on his luck and retired police detective is given a call by an old college friend. The friend wants the detective to follow his wife, as he believes she is in danger. Reluctantly he agrees to take the job. Through a foggy San Francisco he follows a beautiful woman on a circuitous trail impossible to believe. Many would recognize this, as the work of one the greatest cinematic masters of our time, Alfred Hitchcock. The film is Vertigo.Vertigo is a film about obsessive love, loss, guilt and betrayal. Disguised as a psychological thriller, and perhaps ahead of its time, Vertigo released in 1958 with only moderate box office success and mixed reviews. When Hitchcock did North by Northwest a year later he chose Cary Grant over Jimmy Stewart as he blamed Stewart for Vertigo's financial problems. Today Hitch wouldn't be disappointed – Vertigo is often referred to as a Masterpiece and has risen steadily through the years in critical acclaim. Barbara Bel Geddes as Midge and Jimmy Stewart as Scottie Fergusson, play a lengthy introduction scene in Midge's apartment. It's a colorful apartment for a contemporary professional girl of the late fifties with a lovely picture window view of downtown San Francisco. We enjoy being there, and a sense of normalcy prevails. They chit chat about old friends, careers and brassieres and we realize that we are voyeurs here. What we also realize in this lengthy character building scene, is that this sense of normalcy cannot last for long. After all – this is a Hitchcock film. The suspense is already building.The story gets a little darker as Scottie meets with an old college friend, Gavin Elster. Elster wants Scottie to follow his wife as her movements have become mysterious. Initially Scottie resists the offer, but after Elster pleads with him to take the job, Scottie agrees to covertly meet Elster and his wife at Ernie's restaurant. One look at the woman and Scottie is hooked. Kim Novak is stunning in this scene. The effect she has on Scottie is clear from the beginning. Stewart was perfect as the 'everyman' and often played roles where an average guy gets caught up in something bigger than himself and turns out the victim. So much imagery in the film is circuitous in nature. From the spinning graphics in the opening credits to the circular path of the green Jaguar around the streets of San Francisco and the spiral bun in which Carlotta and Madeleine wear their hair. Everything is moving in circles, and like a whirlpool the victims are drawn toward the center as the bottom begins to drop. The first victim is Scottie. The musical score composed by Bernard Herrman cannot be over emphasized. It is an emotional and hauntingly beautiful score that is perfectly coordinated with the thematic elements of the film.At this point in the film Hitchcock shifts gears as the film picks up speed. Scottie follows Madeleine to a flowers shop where she gets an odd bouquet of flowers. Kim Novak protests the gray suit with her platinum blond hair in this scene, but Hitchcock insists. It is a woman dressed like this coming out of a San Francisco fog that Hitch had envisioned for Madeleine. Many scenes were shot with a fog filter if natural fog was not available. From black and white dreams to full color dreams, Hitch portrays this story in a dreamlike fashion and he uses color or the lack of it to help the story along. As Scottie follows Elster's wife Madeleine, he comes to her assistance as she has an 'accident'. He takes her to his apartment to recover. Watch Stewart very closely in this scene as he expertly plays the part, very warm and friendly, but never forward. The view outside Scottie's apartment window is a photographic plate of a street scene, where the cars never move and people never walk. It's clearly not natural, but perfect for the dream-like story Hitchcock is telling. Scottie is falling for Madeleine, and she senses this and tells him she's married. He doesn't seem to hear, as her beauty is beyond reason and the words fall upon a deaf ear. Scottie and Madeleine begin to wander together in their daytime drives around the bay area. They stop along the northern California Sequoia forest and then stop at Cypress Point along the shore. They stand closely together as the waves crash on the rocks below into a large crescendo. In this close-up scene Hitchcock uses a 'process shot' or rear screen projection. It's not quite natural, but we have to realize Hitchcock is not trying to take us there – the background is for Madeleine and Scottie and not for us as he retells this dream-like story.Hitchcock reminds us in Vertigo, that what we fall in love with is strongly connected with what we choose to see. Like the circuitous imagery in the film, the plight of Scottie is also duplicitous. The film has been restored in the late nineties by Universal Pictures. If you've seen this film 20 or 30 years ago on television, you owe to yourself to see the restored version today. Hitchcock was always fond of using rear screen projections and photographic plate backgrounds, but they were especially effective when used in Vertigo. Like the background scenes, the use of color, picture definition and dynamic ranges of light and dark, were not effectively presented with older forms of television.",10,3,7,3 February 2011
Elysium," Will be lauded by some and Egregious to others
","After finishing this movie I felt relieved in a couple of ways: One I didn't waste time at the theater or lay down hard earned cash for the Blu-ray. The fact that I only spent a buck sixty at Red Box left me with a better feeling than the end of this film. The special effects and cinematography were excellent but the story stank it up, all the way to Elysium and the characters were laughingly stereotypical or stoically inhuman.Loosely, the plot is a caricature of America today but set in a futuristic world where the greedy rich and evil corporations grind the life out of the lowly every-man portrayed by Matt Damon. In this futuristic world the rich have deserted the planet for a Florida sized space station called Elysium and left all their troubles far behind. The victims of this film (which I'm guessing are the poor) are stuck on the burnt-out planet with no way to leave.Looking quite fit, Jodie Foster personified the uncaring rich bitch with control of government anti-immigration efforts. A lack of depth in her character lingers throughout the film as we never know much about her, other than she has knockout legs and is mean as a snake.William Fichtner plays the ruthless businessman John Carlyle, which was symbolically a dead ringer for the mythical American corporation that makes tons of money yet never pays taxes. Here again we're at a loss to explain this calculating and laconic character as he has maybe three lines in the film before his ultimate demise.Added perhaps for a little comic relief was the talented Faran Tahir that played the president Patel of Elysium. He's undoubtedly from India and notably pacifistic in comparison to Foster. This left me wondering if Patel is an archetypal symbol of how the writers delight in seeing our own government leaders.Ah, the writers. After finishing the film, I would have bet a droid to a doughnut that the screen writers of were indeed a bunch of freshmen English majors working on their first part-time job. After a little reflection upon the morning after, I came upon two conclusions: One, the screenplay is a little deeper than I first thought or two, the screenplay was indeed so bad that the incompetency added a new and much deeper dimension.On the other side of this equation is the poor downtrodden. Once again, the writers fail to provide a back-story to explain why the greedy rich moved to a space station and why the poor can't seem to turn things around. The poor have inherited the earth but can't do anything with it. They can't look inward to themselves but instead turn scheming eyes to big-brother Elysium. The answer to all this seems to be medical equipment. Yep, strange as it seems, the evil corporation who doesn't mind wasting a few lives, will not waste dollars on elaborate and powerful medical equipment needed to save the life of protagonist Matt Damon (can't remember his character). Matt who was a victim of a careless supervisor (aren't we all?) unwittingly goes into a high-radiation area to avoid delays in production. This would anger Mister evil corporation who is always watching pie and bar charts to monitor plant productivity.The most technically gifted of the poor downtrodden are pretty much devoted to a life of crime. And the crime is sending illegals to Elysium with false DNA IDs aboard fast moving shuttle craft. Finally the criminally downtrodden manage to steal the brain contents of Mister evil corporation and download the knowledge into Matt Damon's noggin. None of these guys have a job so they're excellent hackers. Because of radiation exposure, Matt has five days to live and desperately seeks a way to get to the medical equipment on Elysium or perish. Now this is where the movie gets comical. The list of people that need the medical equipment on Earth keep getting bigger and bigger. To bring this boring mess to an end, the criminally inclined hackers manage to download the data from Matt Damon. This turns out to be a sacrifice and poor Matt becomes another victim. The upside to this mess occurs when the hackers pull an ingenious switch and make all the poor downtrodden of Earth into citizens of Elysium. The last scene in the film has the Elysium shuttle craft (much nicer than earth shuttle craft) picking up it's new citizens for a ride to the Elysium medical facilities. Hope they didn't have to go through a website to arrange this.I generally avoid scathing reviews, but when people spend this much money in the film industry to make a heavy social or political comment, I have to take notice. But it's completely up to the viewer whether this film merits credit, or whether it's a two hour waste of time built with twisted logic and trendy misinformation.",5,1,2,26 December 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Please Disney - don't do this again!!!
","Why another less than superlative review? It's the movies I guess - or Hollywood. There is a good one planned shortly to make up - I promise.Long before this film arrived I claimed you couldn't do Star Wars over. This Disney remake has proved me right. It leaves me wondering if walking away from Lucas was a good thing to do. It's true he overreached himself with the prequels and botched the whole thing. But they could have done better with a proper director and screenwriter. Lucas had the vision, there's no doubt about that.Back to this film: I'm scratching my head. On the one hand it feels like a total remake of the first film with a few corny exceptions.After the last scene, I had to wonder if maybe there WAS a story sweep coming out of all this rehashed mess. Something original perhaps. That would be nice.That's the reason I advise Disney to never do this again. If they want to utilize Star Wars in their theme parks, well that's fine. Just don't ruin a classic syfy saga to do it.",6,33,40,1 February 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Hallows 2 - fumbles at the goal line.
","While following the advice of professional critics I went to the 2D viewing Of Deathly Hallows part 2. Some of the recent installments had been pretty dark and the 3D glasses were supposed to make this worse.The film seemed a little unlike the previous Potter films. Most Potter films have us seeing the story through the eyes of Harry, Hermione and Ron. Hallows 2 was a little impersonal toward our Heroes. The film seemed rushed and shortcuts were taken that eliminated the dialogue we needed to really feel the leading characters pain. Harry in the film can now 'feel' the Horcruxes when near, and sees their location through Voldemort's mind. Hard to imagine Voldemort making such a mistake, but this technique allowed the filmmakers to shorten the dialogue. This was probably a result of the story being delivered in two parts. The last real character development of Harry, Hermione and Ron was in Hallows 1. Hallows 2 it seems, was meant to be an action film. Also new to the film were efforts to create humor by throwing in one-liners from time to time.I thought the film stayed fairly close to Rowling's story, until the end at least. After the Kings Cross scene, the film began to diverge greatly from the book. I wondered if this was because better 3D possibilities were attained with these changes. I watched the movie again in 3D. It wasn't darker than the 2D version and the 3D seemed to help the film. However, I'm completely puzzled why the ending was changed the way it was. After waiting for more than a decade for the final showdown, it's unfortunate we got shorted here. The original ending by Rowling was much cleaner and presented more cinematic possibilities, and simply made a better ending for the series. The CGI for the early dragon scene was very good and I'm left wondering if they just ran out time to finish the thing correctly.I've come to believe most of the professional critics are clueless about this film. It's surely the readers and serious Potter fans that contain real insight into the series. However most people I've talked to that didn't read the book were completely happy with the film and loved all the action scenes in this movie. Many book readers of the series will be disappointed.That all being said - it was a difficult story to tell. Most of the loose ends in the series were tied up. Not too much of Dumbledore's personality was revealed, and that's probably a good thing. The final fleshing out of Snape's enigmatic character were revealed. Will Rowling pick up the pen once more to give us more Harry Potter? A lot could happen in 19 years! I certainly hope so - but not enough to give this film a rating it doesn't deserve.",7,2,2,31 July 2011
