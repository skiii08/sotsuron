Sucker Punch," Chaingun wielding giant demon samurai!!!
","Being a Snyder movie I expected great visuals. And it delivered. The action sequences are great to look at, with fantastic adversaries that deserve a movie of their own (film makers: we need more of those 'chaingun wielding giant demon samurais'!!).The story is OK, nothing special. Although it takes place in three worlds (the 'reallity' world', the 'escape from reality' world and the 'escape from the escape from reality' world), it's easy to follow and there are no surprises.The main problem I have is with the characters. They are not interesting and have little personality. And you never become invested in them. Though it's not the fault of the actors, who do an OK job.In conclusion, this movie is fine if you concentrate in the action sequences. Just don't expect too much from the rest.",Null,0,0,12 October 2011
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Have I told you about sucky endings?
","I have a deep respect for this franchise. The original Prince of Persia is one of the first games I played on the PC back when I was 6-7 years old. Great game. As time went on, I played the game trilogy this movie is 'based on'. Great games too.Despite that, I watched this movie with very low expectations. I mean, it's a video game movie! But I really enjoyed it. The story is fine, the acting is good, the action sequences are nice and it has a bit of humor too. I particularly enjoyed the relationship between the prince and the princess. And Alfred Molina always delivers.The only thing that really disappointed me was the ending: I expected another twist involving time travel. Not just undoing everything that happened in the movie! That sucks.It's not a great movie, but I still recommend it for what it is.",Null,0,2,12 October 2011
