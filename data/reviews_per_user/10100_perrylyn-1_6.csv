The Legend of Bagger Vance," I'm addicted to this movie and can't break the habit.
","Every so often I have to put this film on to get a fix. I do that with films that have an undefinable something which gets under your skin. I'm not a baseball fan but I do the same thing with 'The Natural.' So why am I hooked on this picture? It's certainly not golf. I like the idea of it but I don't play it. I'm not into Zen, or partial to 'angel' movies. Yet all of these ingredients are thrown into the hopper and worked over, by what I've come to realize is a brilliant director, and out comes a masterfully told story. I re-watch the movie, not sure what birdies or eagles are, just to daydream that if I followed Bagger's advice I too good be a great player. I watch it for Michael Ballhous's poetic cinematography. Or for the great 30's costumes draped on a ravishing Charlize Theron. Or for the fantastic performances from Charlize, Matt Damon, Will Smith especially the boy explaining why he loves the game so much. Then when I think I'm cured, I have to watch it again for Rachel Portman's incredible score which cements the other-worldliness of this story so beautifully. I guess if I looked hard I could find flaws, but I don't want to. Sometimes it's better not to analyze things that seem in perfect balance without disturbing that balance. I guess time will cure me. I hope it's not too soon.",10,6,12,8 April 2005
Fight Club," What it feels like to be abducted by Aliens
","I must have been beamed up to a flying saucer at the exact period when I was watching this movie because it feels now that I'm back on earth among the human race again, that I have a totally different view of this film than everyone else. I hated it. It must be me, after reading so many positive reviews praising this film and how it has had a profound effect on them, I feel I must see this movie again for a re-appraisal. What I do remember, before being abducted, was that Fight Club started out so powerfully, I was amazed at the writing. It came out swinging. You knew this wasn't going to be a run-of-the-mill script. Then the story settled into a long drawn out fight after fight sequence that completely turned me off. Not because of the violence. Hey, I'm a Rambo film kinda guy, but just the sheer stupidity of it all. I'm now a bit confused. So many others saw something special in all this that I'm not ready to rate this movie until I force myself to sit through another viewing.",Null,1,2,12 April 2005
The Mummy," I think the mummy put a curse on Stephan Sommers, its director.
","A director is suppose to get better with every movie, not worse. So how did Stephan Sommers go from the wonderful adventure/horror movie 'The Mummy' to the terrible 'The Mummy Returns' to the unwatchable 'Van Helsing?' I have a theory: Everything was in perfect balance in the first half of 'The Mummy'. Branden Fraser, was the perfect adventurer, Rachel Weisz was the perfect bookish librarian who blossoms into an alluring dessert flower with just one costume change. (I thought veils were suppose to cover up beauty not enhance it). Casting in general was perfect. Take Oded Fehr, the chief guardian of the place with his intense looks and great baritone voice. You just knew women were going to pick up on his charisma. Best of all, a great feeling for the creepiness that was ancient Egypt. Last but not least, the best musical score from Jerry Goldsmith that makes everything jell. Then the movie took a wrong turn. It became more special effects and less great adventure storytelling. This was not a fatal mistake because of the great forward momentum of the story. Yet some of the creepiness was evaporating as 'Pirates of the Caribbean' type skeletons were taking over the story. Still, everything was so good, all was forgiven. What the director should have learned from that movie was that too many special effects and too little plot and character development were the wrong formula. So what do we get in 'The Mummy Returns', 70% special effects to a weak story. Then in Van Helsing, its 90% special effect and no story anyone would care to follow. If he can make a great fun film like the Mummy, he has the talent to redeem himself.",9,0,1,11 April 2005
Amadeus," A great lesson in music appreciation
","People who like classical music or Mozart in particular will love this movie. Assuming, of course, they can get past some historical inaccuracies, weird giggles or any other slight on their revered legend.But what about the vast majority of people, who don't listen to classical music? Will this movie have any hold on them? Can someone who's been shaking their booty to MTV be thrown in classical waters and be expected to learn how to swim? If it's at all possible, this movie would be the one to do it. It's about jealousy, backstabbing, mealy-mouthing, blaspheming and stolen ideas. Who can't relate to that. Who hasn't had at least one of the above directed at them?People who swear they wouldn't sit for any classical music, do it all the time when they get moved by a 'classical' score in a movie that stealthily conveys all the emotion of the story.Amadeus spotlights the creation of and appreciation of gorgeous music as seen through the jealous eyes of a competitor who knows in his heart he could never equal it.If you're at that stage where you're yearning for something more than the beat, the riff, the homey twang, go for a little music appreciation that will knock your socks off. One of the best films I've ever seen.",10,1,2,7 June 2005
There's Something About Mary," Just ask yourself 'Would I have had the balls to make this movie?'
","This movie is like modern art. It doesn't consider itself successful unless it offends someone. What's the point of setting out to do a hilariously funny, crude movie if you're going to pull your punches. There will be plenty of outraged people who will miss the point maybe the same ones who rant about how some completely original modern art piece 'is pure garbage!' All I know is that when I saw this movie in the theater, people were practically on the floor laughing. One guy next to me was so worked up he jumped up on his chair and spent most of the movie squatting on it so that he would have more room to roll and sway with every joke. The thing is, the jokes were coming one after the other so there was no point in trying to sit still in the seat. I imagine, without the waves of laughter that you experience in the theater, the jokes might fall flat watching this movie at home. This society is so careful to be politically correct, that we all seem to be walking on eggshells. Here comes this goofy, bull in a china shop of a movie trampling on everything in its way to get a laugh. There's something about everybody in this movie, especially Cameron Diaz, that makes it more than just funny.",10,0,1,11 April 2005
Ray," 'Citizen Kane' is considered one of the top ten movies of all time, but 'Ray' is the one you'll watch over and over.
","If you loved 'Men in black', 'Independence day' or other similar brainless blockbusters don't listen to me because I'll probably steer you wrong. However, If you're like me and appreciate some intelligence in a story, I have one word for you. Ray. It doesn't get any better than this movie if you love to watch the process of creativity. Ray Charles of course was dripping with it. And since Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles so completely, it's like watching a documentary about how he worked and developed his own style. The movie has many other fascinating levels about his blindness, courage and even hard side, but watching the process by which Ray created one great hit after another, was riveting. That's all I have to say, except how many great movies does Taylor Hackford have to make before he's given an Oscar!",10,0,1,11 April 2005
