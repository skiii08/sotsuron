It," I mean...
","... yes, i thought Andy Muschietti did a nice job directing this movie. ... yes, the kids were a lot of fun to watch throughout this film... yes, Penny Wise was recreated in a way that every purist would be satisfied with.but the story?.. oh man, more holes than Swiss cheese! Where are the Suicide Squad critics when you need 'em? I've read a ton of these reviews here and i am just amazed at how many people just don't care that the actual story was a complete and utter mess! Does anybody even TRY to consider the basics of storytelling when watching movies anymore?? There should be more to the story than, 'Avoid the clown, he's trying to get you - get him before he gets you'For starters, they never really clarify what 'IT' is - or why - or how to kill IT... or when to expect IT... or how to avoid IT.. or how it became IT etc. There's no rhyme or reason to IT and there will be no explanation, so I hope you're not expecting one.IT never is explained! They never draw a line and let you know when IT is playing with their minds or when IT is real and physical - or why... or why THESE kids are being haunted. Are any other kids being haunted? (Is this even a haunting?!) Why can some see it and others can't? What does IT want?! (Geez!!) Oddly enough, they spend more time focusing on each kids' parents, who are all abusive in some way, whether physically, sexually, or emotionally, than they do developing the Penny Wise story. Virtually every parent is ugly inside in some way and they never connect these dots. Even the town pharmacist is a lurking pedophile ('You look like Lois Lane' wink~wink) They spend all this time on the parental development and none of it factors into the ending or the rest of the story. Makes no sense WHY they would have chosen to spend the time here.They do make a quasi attempt to show one of the kids interest by showing him researching the town's history in the town library -this leads to the kid running through the library basement trying to get away from killer clowns - but as it turns out - they're not even real!! Just a figment of his imagination apparently.But, then there are the over-the-top, neighborhood bullies that do a little more than simply knock your books out of your hand and poke fun. These thugs are out for blood for some reason (literally). One day, after catching one of their favorite targets they decide to carve initials into his belly with a knife (yes, fourteen year old bullies). The kid somehow breaks free, a chase ensues which leads one of these bullies right into an above ground sewer. A few minutes later, the bully is shown being attacked by a group of killer clowns while in the sewer... you may assume this was just a figment of his imagination too, right?... but no - this time, it was real. Why was this one different than the other? How do we know this one was real? Well, it certainly wasn't because the bullies were talking about it, or mentioning it at all. Matter of fact, the bullies carry on each day beating on kids as if he was still right there in the group.The only way we know his interaction with the clowns was real (?) was because there is a two second clip that shows someone posting a 'Missing Child' poster with the bullies image - but it's business as usual otherwise.**SPOILERS** The young girl is captured at the end of the movie and then looks down Penny Wise's throat at some kind of light.. this seemingly puts her in a trance and now she just floats - er - hovers in the air looking up at the sewer. No explanation!... however, when the group finally catches up to her and finds her floating, one of the kids grabs her and kisses her - magically, her spell is broken and she is normal again... no explanation!... why? To follow up on the hovering girl... during this same final scene, everybody is in this big room where it appears that all the missing kids from the years before are floating in the air in a slow, circular motion. They are doing nothing but floating... NO explanation... just floating... now, one would assume that just like the girl in the group that had her spell broken by being kissed that these kids were not actually dead (?) and could be saved (?).... Once Penny Wise bids his farewell, the children start floating back down... but... that's all you know. Do they wake up? Are they floating down to die in peace? Do they all walk out together? NO EXPLANATION!! As far as the other elements, i thought they tried WAY too hard to copy Stranger Things, going so far as casting Finn Wolfhard. I thought this was a really bad idea. Not because of Finn (I love this kid!), but because it should have tried to separate itself from Stranger Things - not try to get closer to it.The kills were ALL pretty soft. Nothing creative. For example, when they killed the main bully, he only fell down a well (he deserved such a bloodier fate!) Penny Wise was smacked around a little with some clubs but he left on his own terms (he wasn't actually killed!) Meh... too much, 'NO EXPLANATION' for me. It was an OK movie. It was entertaining and some of the shots were nicely framed. The score was pretty nice and eerie at times. Many of the elements that you would have wanted to excel were all here – it was just the bad story line that's tough to forgive.",5,21,42,8 September 2017
Star Trek," Bring Some Wine For All That Cheese!!
","I'm still trying to figure it out myself but I just don't get the hype around this movie at all. One of the biggest things that I took from this movie is that I'm actually pretty impressed with how far and how much JJ Abrams has come cause this was nowhere in the stratosphere of his batman movies and honestly, it had a very big element of 'b film' to it... matter of fact, we couldn't shake the feeling that this movie really seemed like we were watching 'Galaxy Quest' all over again... Believe itI thought the story was extremely rushed, very fragmented and often pretty goofy. I remember watching Star Trek (the TV show) as a kid and thought that this Captain Kirk was definitely a mismatch... Captain Kirk was always ...coooool no matter what... I did not get that same feeling from this new one.... actually this kid did nothing but get his little tail kicked in all movie long... I don't think he won one single fightThe 'bad guy'?... (Sure thing!)... certainly NOT intimidating... never was I afraid of running into this nicely spoken Nero... he just simply added to the cheese that this movie is filled with.The cgi was 'Eh' at best... The original creations and/or creatures were 'Eh' at best... dialogue, 'Eh' at best... the only good that came of me watching this movie was that I can now finally say that I watched this movie.Sadly, I WILL watch the sequel (Into Darkness) but more because I'm an optimist (and an obvious sucker!)... but I will also expect significantly less and will make sure to bring some wine for all that cheese",5,1,2,12 September 2013
It Chapter Two," I Fell For It Again!!!
","This 'IT' series has somehow created a world where there are no rules, no logic and the writers can do whatever they want without supplying answers, no matter how badly you will crave them.Nothing makes sense here; sometimes it's a dream, sometimes it's real(?) - sometimes they are dreaming yet pulling things out from the dream into reality... all without any explanation or reasoning to when it is one or the other... easily the most frustrating 'horror' series to watch if you want a solid story line.Another frustrating thing about this movie is that IT IS what IT IS because of the clown, Pennywise, yet, he is incredibly under-used in this movie for some reason. It seems they save his most screen time for the end of the movie when the 'fit hits the shan', but he's not really even Pennywise at that point, it's just some CGI Pennywise hybrid.The jump scares were easy to identify, especially if you are just half-way seasoned to the horror genre. The run-time was indeed long, but i don't think the complaint about run time is just that it's long - i'm fairly certain people would have no problem with run time it if the story itself was more airtight.Trust me, i'm taking it very easy on this movie... there's so much more to shred.** SPOILERS **
so, after all that, i haven't even touched on the end... that.. ridiculous, RIDICULOUS ending. (The running joke with mcavoy's character and how 'the ending wasn't good' is very fitting for this movie and serves as foreshadowing.... typical stephen king)As they outlined earlier in the movie, the creature of IT was cast as an ancient curse that has survived thousands of years and with that, it would take a ritual of sorts to defeat this mighty creature... but hold everything... that would only make a LITTLE bit of sense and we have already established, LOGIC is no place for a clown movie like IT... no, no, nothey literally spent ninety minutes of the film gathering things from their childhood JUST for this ritual to NOT work - BUT, fear not - as it turns out - all anyone needed to do ALL these years was some good old fashioned name calling and the IT would go away.. and not only be defeated, but be defeated very meekly and easily... 'You're Just A Clown! You're Just A Clown!' they would yell and in doing so, the mighty Pennywise shrunk aaalllll the way down to the size of a baby.seriously... they call him names for maybe...90 seconds.. and just like that, the horror is all over! this is how Pennywise dies - for good!JUST. SO. DUMB!!!Look, if the idea is to be entertained, then you will be entertained if nothing else because the cast itself is WAY too good to not appreciate on screen - Hader, McAvoy, Skarsgard and Chastain are terrific - but there's no surprises there and honestly, that's also what makes this movie even more disappointing - you had this amazing ensemble of talent and you gave them THIS weak story and this even worse ending.... if you are going to watch this movie, enjoy the performances because it's all you're gonna get... it's also the only reason i rated this movie a 4 and not a 3.",4,1,2,11 September 2019
