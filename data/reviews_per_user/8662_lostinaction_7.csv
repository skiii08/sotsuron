Changeling," Thank you Mr. Eastwood, thank you Ms. Jolie!
",I watched this Movie yesterday and I'm still impressed. It moved me emotional and touched me. I was very curious about CHANGELING because I like the Work of Clint Eastwood he did as Director. The Story is about a Mother who lost her son. Something like that must be terrible for a mother. The Mother never stopped to looking for her kid and I thought the same would have done my Mother too. I lost my mother some years ago and this movie reminded me a lot of her and touched me. Angelina Jolie is wonderful as Mother and she was perfect as young self confident woman around 1928. Her acting surprised me; she was totally believable and moving in her role. Maybe one of the best acting in her career.The second thing I admired was the scenery and the photography of CHANGELING. I really thought that it was like a Window to another Time long ago. The supporting cast around the all time great John Malkovich was also very convincing in their roles. I enjoyed CHANGELING for me it's a movie with Grit and strong performances. The slow music which sounds sad but also hope was a good choice. It might have a slow start but soon I was in the powerful story and not a single moment bored or annoyed. I couldn't take my eyes of this carefully photographed Movie.Thank You Mr. Eastwood; thank You Ms. Jolie for these wonderful and suspenseful two hours. If you are someone with Heart and who believes in the world and humanity you certainly will enjoy CHANGELING.,10,4,6,24 January 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Pulp Fiction goes France in WW 2
","I'm still impressed by this film directed by Quentin Tarantino. The last movie by him which impressed me that much was Pulp Fiction. All the ingredients I loved in Pulp Fiction I found again in Inglorious Basterds. I was totally impressed how Mr. Tarantino handled it to direct a movie with three languages. One of the reasons might be that he made right choices for the cast. Germans/Austrians are speaking German, Americans/British are speaking English and French are speaking French. Only one person in this movie can speak all three (four) languages fluently: the SS Officer Hans Landa. Hans Landa is portrayed by the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz. He must be some kind of a linguistic genius. To be precisely they are speaking a little Italian too. It's worth to watch the movie only to listen to the Italian from Brad Pitt. Unfortunately I don't speak any French but it was wonderful to listen to the other languages I know well. Next to Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt the beautiful French Actress MÃ¨lanie Laurent convinced me.This movie contains a lot of dialogues, humor, bloody violence and perfect acting. It reminded me a lot on Pulp Fiction. The most important thing I was positively surprised as I was about 15 years ago during watching Pulp Fiction. I'm a big fan of Spaghetti Westerns and it was fun hearing familiar sounds in the background. But I wished Tarantino would have used lesser known Music because some of them we already have heard in his former works. Inglorious Basterds includes everything what you need for a pleasant evening: well written dialogues and a lot of killed Nazis.",10,12,27,20 August 2009
Quantum of Solace," 007 Hardboiled: Another Way to Die
","Another Way to Die is the Title of the Opening Music Theme of this Movie. No the Song isn't great but the Title of this song has more to do with the movie as in other James Bond Movies. Daniel Craig is back as 007 and he is more hardboiled as in Casino Royale. No wonder he lost his Love and now he is dead. Not physically dead but dead inside. He has a new Target to destroy and kill all the members of a mysterious Organisation. Through this Movie we will find out more about these people and what they are planning.I have to say I watched it twice. The first Time I saw I thought: Yes it's a simple Vengeance Story with some great Action Scenes. I was wrong. 007 is more adult now, he isn't the spy with an arsenal of funny gadgets and only on a Mission, he is man full of emotions and he is not Superhero anymore who knows everything. He is a realistic character more about the novels of Ian Fleming as of the Roger Moore Bond in Moonraker or Pierce Brosnan in Die another Day.All what you see in QoS is State of Art and Technique. Some of these have been already used in the Bourne Action Thrillers. Like it or not the fast editing of some action scenes. The first time I watched QoS it surprised me badly and I was a bit annoyed. Not the second time. The scenes are looking realistic, Bond sweats and blooded and it's more like an adrenalin rush. The scenery I still like best is the one at the Bregenz Sea Opera in Austria. It's Creative Thriller/Action scenery next to Puccini's great Opera Tosca. Here you can see the talent and the potential of the Director Marc Foster.The acting is much better as I thought the first Time. It's good to see that next to terrific Daniel Craig the bond girls aren't just Bimbas without brain anymore. Both actresses (Olga Kurlyenko as Camille and Gemma Aerton as Fields) are showing fine performances. Camille is not only beautiful no she has a past. Similar to Bond she has an unfinished business to do. The scenes with Fields are fun to watch and will satisfy James Bond Fans. Next to these Beauties we see the return of Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) from Casino Royale. The scenes between Mathis and 007 are really Bond-Buddy like and this is James Bond pure. Of course M and Felix Leiter have a Comeback so. Sorry but you'll not find Miss Moneypenny and the Master of Gadgets Q.As stated before Another Way to Die wouldn't be a bad Title instead of Quantum of Solace. James Bond is a much more complex character and next to his character development there is still a thrilling plot. Dominic Greene and his strange looking Assistant Elvis are the Villains with a plan who is more believable than just not destroying the World for a lot of money. I'm still not quite sure who this guy Elvis should represent because as Bodyguard he seems to be useless. But there are some more enemies waiting for Bond: a former Bolivian Dictator and a stupid Agent from another Agency.It's the shortest Bond Movie ever but the plot isn't easy as usual. In a way this Movie needs full concentration on the screen what is going on there. Before watching it you need to know who Vesper was, maybe you should watch Casino Royale before. Daniel Craig is a dark gritty James Bond. There is humor in this one but not as much as I wished Not to forget a lot of references to old James Bond Movies. Real 007 Fans will not have troubles to find them all.IMO QoS wasn't as good as Casino Royale but it was a good sequel to it and pretty fine adrenalin entertainment. For those who complain about Quantum of Solace remember the last line of a James Bond 007 Movie is: JAMES BOND WILL RETURN.",8,1,2,10 November 2008
Revolutionary Road," Best acting couple for years
",During watching this movie I was thinking the performances of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are convincing and extremely good. In my opinion one of the best and most believable couple I've seen for years in cinema. Both knew each other well as if they played a hundred times together. Strange to know that it is only her second movie together. For me the acting is very important in a drama. It was good to see that in the supporting cast Michael Shannon has a remarkable performance as crazy neighbor and the always good Kathy Bates as his mother. Of course all the other actors are also showing solid performances.This Drama from Director Sam Mendes shows the life of a young couple in the 50's of the last century. Sam Mendes directed also the famous 'American Beauty' and again he let us see what happens behind the doors of the houses of American families. It's a satirical look which includes tragedy and love. Revolutionary Road is not a Comedy in the classical meaning so keep this in mind when you watching it else you could get an unpleasant kick.What was keeping my attention? Firstly as mentioned the acting and then of course the realistic story about a couple in the 1950's. When I first saw Leonardo DiCaprio on screen I was thinking he is dressed in a Frank Sinatra Style. So please also watch at the settings and costumes. All were selected carefully. The cinematography is as usual beautiful in a Sam Mendes Movie.If you like Drama and like to see good performances in a setting of the 1950's this Movie is definitely for you.,10,9,17,4 February 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," An easy escape to a fantasy world
","Can you take a movie seriously in which alien robots can transform into cars or planes? I can't. Transfomers 2 is supposed to be an entertaining summer popcorn movie and nothing more. It's made for the masses to make a hell of money. Good acting is not needed. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox are the young attractive couple which is fighting with the good Transformers versus the bad Transformers. Both are shining and part of the pleasure. I enjoyed seeing Jon Torturro again as crazy former Agent. There is a lot of plenty CGI Action in it and typical for Michael Bay Explosions en mass. The Humor, Dialogues and Plot are made that everybody round the world can easily follow it. It's more difficult to find out which transformer is fighting against whom as to understand the movie. Not the best flick ever but it's a simple escape to a fantasy world. Turn off your brain and enjoy this piece of entertainment.",6,0,3,25 July 2009
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A true classic Horror Movie about a modern Vampire
","Do you need a big budget to make a good Horror Movie? No, Wes Craven and many other Directors of that Genre proved that more than once. From today's point of view some special effects might look a bit poor but some others are still impressive and they still stick in my mind. What I impressed more than the blood and gore scenes are the creation of a new kind of Horror figure: Freddy Krueger. In a kind he is a modern Vampire. He isn't like Bela Lugosi's or Christopher Lee's Dracula a fashionable and handsome man who tries to seduce his victims. No he is more like Max Schreck's Count Orlok of the classic Nosferatu. An ugly person you fear when you see him. Freddy Krueger doesn't suck out the blood but the sucks out the fear of his victims. He needs their fear to live and like a Cat with a Mouse he plays with his victims before he kills them. Most of them are teenager and like a Vampire he is coming into the night when all the children sleep. If one of the youngsters let him in their dream it's pretty difficult to survive for them.It's not so easy to create a horror figure. Director Wes Craven had the luck to find with Robert Englund the perfect cast for this role. Also some of the young actresses and actors are showing good performances. As Max Schreck was Count Orlok Robert Englund is Freddy Krueger. No wonder that so many sequels would follow. Next to the creation of a perfect new horror monster the whole movie follows somehow the concept of old classics. If you hear a children song in a horror movie it's always scary. The concept of the plot is like an old urban legend, myth or old classic ghost story. A young teenage girl is telling his parents that she dreamed of a monster that tried to kill her. Nobody believes her and keep on telling her it's just a nightmare. Freddy Krueger cannot come into the dreams of adults they don't have the imagination of fantasy anymore.Next to the plot I was always impressed of the style of directing and photography of A Nightmare on Elm Street. It's 80's style with contemporary music. The movie it self has a Gothic nightmarish atmosphere but Wes Craven used the colors and the look of the 1980's for it. The first A Nightmare on Elm Street Movie isn't a typical Horror Mainstream product. Wes Craven not only broke with some of the common rules of the genre he also reinvented some old classic rules of the genre into a new light. I highly recommend this piece of 80's culture to every movie fan not only the horror fans. If you don't like horror series don't watch the sequels but watch Wes Craven's Version of a Nightmare.",10,12,14,23 April 2009
The Proposal," Sandra Bullock as not likable person in her nice comedy comeback!
","If someone would ask me on the street if I would marry Sandra Bullock I would say yes in a minute. OK but mostly she plays very likable characters in her films. But this time she is a business woman who seems not to have a lot of fun in her life. I wonder if this role was supposed for Jennifer Aniston. In the great tradition of Screwball Comedies we see Ryan Reynolds as her male opponent. He is her employee. The only chance not to loose his job he loves so much is to play her fiancÃ©. It sounds terrible for a good relation but good for a romantic comedy with some touching moments. The supporting cast with Betty White, Craig T. Nelson, Mary Steenburgen, and Oscar Nunez are all pretty good and enjoying their roles. Don't know why but I got the feeling everybody was very relaxed in this production. Maybe cause of the beautiful locations the movie was photographed. Of course it's a solid comedy not untypical other similar movies but it had certain touching moments and it's good to see the sympathetic Sandra Bullock on screen again.The story was good enough to keep my attention but I thought it could have been a little more adult. I don't know if any kids are really that interested to see a romantic comedy between an elder woman and a younger man. After I left the cinema I had a good feeling and a smile on my face which made it worth to watch.",7,0,4,13 August 2009
