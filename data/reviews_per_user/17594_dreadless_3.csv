It," HATERS READ THE BOOK
",All you haters slating this film on here saying to graphic or aimed at kids please read the book and understand the context of the story before you voice your opinion on how it has been retold more accurate and less tame than the original hence the distaste from some audiences good film good remake and true king fans would be proud,10,0,0,1 January 2018
It," 'IT' is awesome for those that got sucked into the novel
",This is a much more accurate remake of the novel than the mini-series and people that are slating this film have obviously not read the book or other greats epics from the King that need time/care and diligence to be told correctly such as the Stand and Under the Dome etc. Its not just about the horror and gore (which is not the defining point of a good movies but if you want to see more i recommend human centipede and an appointment with the psychiatrist. King stories are about friendship and basic humanity against the odds whether it be against shape shifting monsters in the drains eating kids or against world wiping plagues or ghosts he is a storyteller that sets the bar and hollywood realises this as he will be living off royalties from their remakes for the rest of his life. For all that love the novel and love when a good book gets re-told in film successfully taking time to convey the full story then watch part 1 one of the IT remake and eagerly await second half like myself.,10,0,0,1 January 2018
It," Great book to film adaptation
",To all those that have heard bad things but read the original novel all those bad things are from people who only watched original mini-series. Part 1 of IT the remake is only covering half the original book like original mini-series but this film in comparison to the first part of the mini series is much closer and conveys more of the character development and background that the mini-series missed. Although there may be some artistic licence employed throughout transposing book to motion picture I believe this film shits all over the mini-series and is a homage and tribute to what is an incredible horror story still thrilling readers today (i know this is a remake and it inspired me to read the book and watch original mini-series and its the first book in my life to make me check my plug hole in the sink at night and think twice before spending time with clowns.P.S No offence to Tim Curry as Pennywise in the original you set the bar but new film is the one ;-),10,0,0,1 January 2018
