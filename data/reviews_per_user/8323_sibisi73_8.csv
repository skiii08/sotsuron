Ali," Floaty-lite
","As with most biopics where the subject is involved in the process, 'Ali' is watered down, uninvolving and opaque. This is a man who has become a true living legend, an icon, and an inspiration to millions of people - why then did I come away from it without any idea of who the man is? The film seemed to skim over any of the revelations in favour of the known facts, jumping from fight to fight leaving a tantalising trail of clues to the man, but refusing to follow them. There is no indication of Ali's power to inspire, and no clue as to just why he demands such adulation and hero-worship. 
Mann's film is a frustrating exercise, perfectly well made, beautifully shot, and competently acted by the lead players. But the substance has been knocked out of it. It floats like a butterfly, but where's the sting?",Null,0,1,12 March 2002
Insomnia," Half-baked in Alaska.
","Much like a pivotal scene in the movie, a superb cast are stranded in this well below average movie, seemingly fogbound by their own collective credibility. These are leaden characters, who act without motivation, in a film teeming with implausibilities and plot-holes. The unusual setting, used to such mesmerising effect in the Coen brothers' 'Fargo', or Fincher's 'Se7en', is merely a gimmick here that does nothing to hide the obvious shortfalls. Actually, the film owes much to Fincher's, atmospherically at least, and various scenes bring it to mind, most notably the chase through the fog, reminiscent of Brad Pitt's pursuit through the rain-drenched alleyways of 'Se7en'.The film wants to be too much, and achieves very little, and, despite everything ending wrapped up in a neat little parcel, it's the sluggish direction that is the real let-down.",Null,0,0,7 September 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A load of old Baggins
","After such incredible hype I knew I'd be disappointed by this movie, but I was shocked at just how unenthralling, childish, and mundane it was. Call me old-fashioned, but fantastic CGI set pieces do not a 'masterpiece' make. The problem, for me, seems to be that the book itself is not a literary masterpiece by any means, and treating it like some holy grail, has blinkered Peter Jackson, making him believe that he is also recreating that masterpiece on screen. So, what we have is an outdated children's' fantasy, pounded with millions of dollars of effects and talent, resulting an overlong advertisement for WETA and the New Zealand tourist board.There are, of course, good things here, fantastic things, even. But what has stayed with me is the total sense of being underwhelmed. I was never gazing at the screen in awe. For such an 'epic' production that is unforgivable. Also, equally unforgivable, was the excellent cast speaking some of the most embarrassing dialogue this side of 'Sunset Beach'. All that pseudo-mystic codswallop - 'You must cast the ring back into the fiery chasm from whence it came!' - and every mention of 'Mount Doom' had me stifling a snigger. I could have dealt with it better if there had been some kind of acknowledgement of it's delusions of grandeur, but it was all done so straight-laced, without a hint of tongue-in-cheek, that the best pun.Definitely see it, simply because it will be huge, and you'll feel left out if you don't. Otherwise, under 16s and those who don't mind switching off their imagination will love it.",Null,0,1,27 December 2001
Pitch Black," Serious sci-fi shenanigans
","When they crash land on an unknown planet, the passengers and crew have to plan a way off before the impending solar eclipse. When darkness falls the planet is beset by millions of marauding monsters who live underground in the daylight. Unfortunately, for the crew, this planet of perpetual sunlight is about to be plunged into darkness for the first time in 22 years - which is the worst bit of bad luck since Janet Leigh decided to pull in at the Bates Motel!Full of cliches, and a cringeworthy script, 'Pitch Black' is at least one of a rare breed nowadays - a sci-fi movie that takes itself seriously, and one that delivers a real scare. The monsters are pretty terrifying, and it's an ingenious device to show them mainly through the eyes of Riddick, a prisoner who has had his eyes adapted to see in the dark (an amazing bit of good luck!). In fact, it's the look of the film that really puts it apart from others in it's class. There is an ethereal glare to the whole planet, either sepia toned, or tinted blue, which makes for a genuinely distorted view. it's also a relief to see an unknown cast, which always benefits this type of story because you don't identify with any one character.Although it's budgetary limits are sometimes plain to see, and it's heart at one with the best of the B-movies, it's still worth a rental if you're sick of seeing the same 'Alien' rip-offs.",Null,0,0,29 October 2001
Moulin Rouge!," If you love excess...
","An incredible sensory overload, 'Moulin Rouge!' sees Baz Luhrmann almost lose control of his own fertile imagination. The whole movie is a complete WOW! I haven't seen anything so creative, both in style, and content, for a long time. Everything about this movie screams excess, and that's what you get. There is so much going on that at times it is just too much. The first 20 minutes or so is a cacophony that takes a while to acclimatise to...but once you do you should be wrapped up in the whole experience.This is first truly musical musical in a very long time, with astonishing inventiveness applied to the script, the choice of songs, and the cinematography. The mixture of contemporary pop songs and turn of the century showmanship is inspired. Everyone involved gives 110%, especially the two leads who bravely dive straight into each song and survive with their dignity intact. Jim Broadbent almost steals the film, but it is such a collective effort that it would be unfair to mention it! Everyone (including 20th Century Fox) seems to have taken a leap of faith in making this movie, and it seems to have paid off. The only nagging doubt is that, with so many fancy trimmings, the emotional heart of the story is suffocated.A must-see twice movie, because first time round you'll be reeling.",Null,0,1,14 October 2001
Singin' in the Rain," Most entertaining movie ever made!
","A perfect movie in every sense, 'Singin In The Rain' has rightly gone down in history as the best musical picture ever. But it is much more than that. A sparkling comedy, with a cast that is 100% perfect, and one of the best movies about movies ever made too.Gene Kelly's genius has never been more apparent than in this movie, but, as always he never steals the show, in fact here practically having the show stolen from him by Donald O'Connor's gravity defying 'Make 'Em Laugh' and Jean Hagen's unforgettable Lina Lamont. Kelly's title number is the epitome of carefree nonchalance. The guy's in love and he isn't going to let a little rain get in the way. This 'classic' scene is possibly the feelgood moment to beat all others. I defy anyone not to succumb to the Kelly's Irish charm during this number, if you haven't already been won over.But a musical is just a musical without a decent story. That's where Comden and Green's pertinent screenplay comes in. Using Nacio Herb Brown's songs from the era in which the movie is set we are taken back to Hollywood in transition, a time when silent movies were ousted by the talkies. For what is generally regarded as just a light-hearted song and dance movie 'Singin In The Rain' takes a pretty accurate line and takes a satirical swipe at the studios and the gossip mongers of the day. There were stars, like Lina Lamont, whose careers disintegrated on the advent of talking pictures, and others, like Kathy Seldon, whose stars were beginning to rise. For a while, there weren't enough voice coaches to go round! The race to match the success of 'The Jazz Singer' was truly chaotic, with studios churning out potboiler after potboiler to cash in on the talking picture. It was also a time when MGM itself started it's reign of the musical genre with epic production numbers, and casts of thousands. In a sense,'Singin In The Rain' both lampoons and celebrates it's own ancestry and place in cinema history.Exhilarating, exuberant, and mesmerising. Still, in my opinion, the most entertaining, and the best, movie ever made!",10,16,22,22 August 2001
Halloween," The original SCARY MOVIE!
","*SPOILERS*Surely, the true measure of a well-made horror movie is how scary it is. If so, then 'Halloween' is still top of the pile. Admittedly there have been movies before, and since, that meet this criteria, but none have sustained that fear throughout, and even after the experience is over.The key that lifts Carpenter's film above most films in the genre is it's nonchalant approach to the killings. Haddonfield is a hub of normality, white picket fences, and frankly dull lives. Nothing happens here, but the urban legend of the killer Michael Myers still does the rounds with local kids. He has, literally, become the bogeyman, living on in ghost stories, whose name has been whispered for almost twenty years, almost as a bad joke amongst the children who are too young to remember the truth. When Myers returns to his community the bogeyman becomes a reality. The suspense is unbearable in parts, with Carpenter using every inch of the screen. What you can't see is infinitely more terrifying than what you can, and what you don't understand is more disturbing. Myers' motives are never revealed, he just does what he does, he has no reason, and cannot be reasoned with. Myers' boiler suit and blank mask are perfect for this 'faceless' killer. He moves almost silently, even gracefully, like an automaton, yet is unbelievably threatening. Carpenter's score is the perfect accompaniment for 'the Shape' (after previews without the music Carpenter was told it simply 'wasn't scary '). The whole mood of the piece is changed and led by this simple, but effective music.What, on paper, must've looked like an unoriginal and unimaginative plot, becomes, in Carpenter's hands a groundbreaking and genre-defining moment. Incorrectly regarded as the 'father' of many things (the stalk and slash sub-genre, the camera-as-killer motif, the unkillable killer, the 'false' ending etc) it still deserves to be THE reference point for all of these, as it combines them all more effectively than any other movie before or since. The tension never lets up, and the experience of this movie should stay with you for a long time. Not only damn scary, but good fun for film fans to spot the in-jokes!DO NOT watch any 'Friday The 13ths', 'Screams', or, indeed, any other 'Halloweens' until you have been through this one!",10,0,0,22 August 2001
The Iron Giant," Captivating for all ages
","An animated movie with so much to offer all ages, and so well done that you'd be hard pressed not to be in tears! Set in the 1950's, it captivates not because of the animation itself (which isn't bad, but isn't anything we haven't seen before) but more because of the great script, the perfect sense of the time in which it is set, and ultimately because the filmmakers haven't pandered to the kids. They have told a wonderful story, and they have achieved what is rarely achieved in animated features - characters that you really can believe in...even if they are 100ft metal monsters!Gimmick-free and with real heart. You'll forget Disney ever existed!",Null,1,1,26 August 2001
