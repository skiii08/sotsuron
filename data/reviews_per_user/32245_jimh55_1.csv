Deja Vu," More of the same
","Are the yanks incapable of making a film with a story.This is just another film for the brain dead.It seems that Hollywood can't produce anything unless it has a superman,explosions,murder and death,added to this is a litany of dud,useless dialogue that reflect the shallowness of the characters the film portrays.One of these days the yanks will produce something that hasn't been done a million times before.The problem is this film is just another from the Hollywood sausage machine.The scary thing is that that the Brit film industry is now going the same way with trash like Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels...what happened to reals story telling with real characters.Jim",1,9,17,12 October 2007
