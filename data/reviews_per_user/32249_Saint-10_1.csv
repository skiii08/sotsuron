Antz," Good animation movie!
","After I saw it, I think DreamWorks have a potential to challenge with Disney. It's an entertaining movie. The plot and storyline are very interest, and the computer graphics also a terrific. By the way, Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, and Sylvester Stallone did a good job for dubbing the voice. Overall, it's a good animation movie.",Null,0,0,4 November 1998
