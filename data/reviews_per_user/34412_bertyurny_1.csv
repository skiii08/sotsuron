Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Awful absolute rubbish
","I went to see Borat because of the great hype generated in all media. I even checked on IMDb en saw a great mark of more than 8/10. I was extremely disappointed in two ways: first the movie is absolute rubbish, full of easy and cheap 'humor' without any real message line. The movie is clearly taken from an American perspective. It seems that every non-American is a complete idiot, extremely racist and vulgar. Secondly,I am most surprised by the amount of people can actually like this movie and who declare it is the best comedy ever. Maybe liking this movie or not says a lot of the cultural level of people. In my opinion you have to be a complete idiot to be able to like this movie.There is really nothing funny about th whole movie. For those who really enjoyed this movie, I would recommend that you see some other stuff like Blackadder, Fawlty towers.",1,5,12,15 March 2007
