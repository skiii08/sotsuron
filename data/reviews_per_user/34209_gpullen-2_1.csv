United 93," Flight 93
","A must see....the events of 9/11/01 changed history in America. I for one sat in my living room and watched in disbelief as the Twin Towers were struck and crumbled. From that day on my life changed. America changed, our FREEDOMS changed.Having recently seen the movie 'The Hamburg Cell' I went into the theater with a little history of how the terrorists met and planned the events that took place on 9/11. It opened my eyes to the way they felt about us and it made me understand their 'plan' as savage as it was.Having just been to see Ground Zero a week prior, it was extremely emotional for me. I can't imagine the hell those people went through in those buildings or the utter chaos that took place on those hijacked planes.It was sobering! The lives that were lost senselessly that day counted for something and I feel they should be remembered for a lifetime. United 93 made my heart go out to the victims and the victims families that will have to endure that pain forever.It was a tribute to pure heroism...and an excellent portrayal of desperation as they had to face their untimely deaths.",10,0,2,3 May 2006
