The Monuments Men," Something Missing...
","Yes, you have two or three cute speeches from Clooney. Damon's charm although he surprisingly doesn't want to close the deal with the lady (I'll talk a bit more about this down here). You have even got some funny scenes and surprise deaths and yet when it all ends you just get that feeling you get when something isn't right, there's something missing...Good Points - I don't know if this is that good but I have to admit it was interesting to a movie where there's no love story whatsoever, at least apparently and it sure would be really easy to have Damon closing the deal in Paris, even the ending with the tie would be way more interesting with the love story in the background, but they decided not to do it, instead they had only one true love story, the love story between men and art and that I have to admit, it was an hell of a love story.Bad Points - Lack of suspense, lack of Hollywood story perhaps, lack of something, that's for sure and that something is without a doubt what keeps this movie from being more than just a movie because they had an amazing true story they based the movie in and still they couldn't succeed as they should...And don't tell me it was because of the true story they didn't succeed because 'A Brilliant Mind', per example, was also based on a true story and it was, like the name suggests, brilliant and like this you have got so many more, but 'The Monuments Men' sure isn't one of them. Maybe the 'George Clooney - Screenplay' and his lack of experience explains that and I honestly expect someone to take this story and recreate it properly someday!To sum up, Great movie, no more than that but also nothing less than that. 6,4 out of 10.
