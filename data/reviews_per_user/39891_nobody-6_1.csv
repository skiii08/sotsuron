Requiem for a Dream," Melodramatic, but affecting
","Requiem For A Dream suffers from melodrama, can be overwrought at times, and the lives of its characters sometimes aren't believable. That said, the movie is affecting and I loved it. The plight of the addict fascinates and moves me, and this movie shows the utter hopelessness of addiction quite compellingly. Requiem For A Dream not only shows you how drugs take away the dignity and destroy the dreams of its characters, but through several inventive techniques, makes the viewer feel the characters' desperate inability to stop. This movie, more than anything, will make you feel. It is gritty and will haunt you long after you've seen it...",8,0,0,6 June 2001
