The Rock," Michael Bay Can Keep on Making Movies...
","Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) is a chemical weapons specialist for the FBI. So when a rogue general (Ed Harris) overtakes Alcatraz island and has a variety of rockets with VX warheads, he is called in to stop the general. But first he must subdue his new partner, lifelong convict and criminal genius Mason (Sean Connery). (I'm tempted to ask why the government has illegal VX warheads... something the movie never discusses... but I won't bother.) Some people (such as Trey Parker and Matt Stone) give Michael Bay a hard time for making flashy movies with little substance. And usually I'm right there with them. As I type, 'Transformers' is coming out and it looks to be a horrible film in every possible way. But I think Bay really did a decent job here combining action with characters the audience can love.Let's talk about the action and characters. The action is undeniable: explosions, gun fights, and other such goodness (maybe not on the level of 'Die Hard' but still pretty good). And there is an extremely memorable car chase scene through the streets of San Francisco. Probably the best part of the film. So the action is nailed done firm.The characters are also well done here. Nicholas Cage's character is pretty decent, though he suffers from outbursts that make no sense. Ed Harris plays his general role very straight and is quite possibly 'the rock' the title refers to (besides Alcatraz, of course) because he holds the film together. And then Connery, who is always good. Connery's character might have been poorly scripted at times (he, like Cage, suffers from unusual outbursts) but this is also a very deep character (though once his secret is revealed, I found it a little disappointing). Quentin Tarantino allegedly did some writing on this one... I have no idea what parts.The romance is played done, and luckily Claire Forlani has a really small part. My friend Eric loves her, and I love 'Mallrats', but I'm sorry.. she's almost as bad as Minnie Driver. Actually, no, she might be even worse.I am not an action fan, and I'll be the first to admit it. So I grade them a little harsh at times. But look, this one fared alright... and I think if you're going to watch an action film, you can do a lot worse than this one. Great actors, an interesting plot (overtaking Alcatraz? brilliant). And the focus on the interaction between Cage and Connery rather than the bigger action of the terror plot paid off -- they have a chemistry stronger than any VX warhead.",7,3,4,16 April 2007
The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Clever Concept
","Two parallel stories about two identical women; one living in Poland, the other in France. They do not know each other, but their lives are nevertheless profoundly connected.Polish cinema is not well-known. France and Italy seem to have the European continent locked when it comes to great films. For Poland, you have Roman Polanski, and he has spent much (probably most) of his career outside the country. But this film is one example of the great things that can come out of Poland.The very concept is interesting. Two people who are very much alike, whose lives influence each other, but live in completely separate places and do not know each other. Is it possible? Probably not. But a great premise, just the same.",7,1,3,28 May 2015
The King's Speech," Well-Acted, Well-Paced Historical Drama
","This is the true story of King George VI (Colin Firth) and his rise to power while also fighting off a problem with stammering. Not to mention the rise of Nazi Germany, and any number of other problems. I first watched this film in early February, 2011. One month prior, 'King's Speech' had ranked fairly low on my to-see list. Then the buzz started coming, the Academy Awards nominated the film for an astounding twelve awards, and reports started to come in that the film was matching the hype. So now I have seen it, and I must say it was pretty good. Flash forward to April 2011 and I have seen it again -- the film holds up well, and while we may debate about whether it deserved all its awards, it certainly earned what it got.I know little of Colin Firth's work, and have never appreciated Helena Bonham Carter, but this film shows them both to be on top of their game. Shots were scheduled around Carter, who was working on Harry Potter at the time, but she used her free time to study up on her character with historians. I would say she put her all into this picture.Firth seemed to be a shoo-in for the best actor Oscar, and sure enough he nailed it. Geoffrey Rush is always great, and this is no exception... I was hoping for a supporting actor win the way he uses his mime training to move his body fluidly.The film was fairly lengthy for such a simple topic, but it was paced very well and because of that could probably have been even longer and I would have been just fine with it. Some people are complaining about the film's historical accuracy, and I hear that, but the film in general is pretty great and the Nazi aspect can be overlooked. It was interesting to see Queen Elizabeth II so young...You might not recognize her, but Claire Bloom (Chaplin's 'Limelight') is here, and if you are interested in commentaries, check this one out. The commentary includes director Tom Hooper singing 'Montage' from 'Team America: World Police', and he repeatedly calls the film a bromance.",8,0,2,6 February 2011
Despicable Me 2," Exceeds The Original
","Gru (Steve Carell) is recruited by the Anti-Villain League to help deal with a powerful new super criminal.Opinion is mixed on whether the first or second is the better film, and this is ultimately a personal and subjective decision. For me, however, the second is better than the first and it is easy to explain why: the shift from the kids to the minions as the secondary characters. Some people prefer the kids, while others (myself included) prefer the minions.In 2013, the strongest animated film is certainly 'Frozen' and that will likely be the film to take home the Oscar (just as they snagged the Golden Globe). However, 'Despicable Me 2' is a strong contender; while not quite as inventive in the animation department, or musically, it still manages to be the most entertaining film and that should count for something. Of the two, this is the one that will probably get more repeat viewings.Mysteriously, Pharrell Williams' 'Happy' was nominated for best original song. As great as this film may be, the music is not its strong point. Not that 'Happy' is a bad song, but it does very little to stand out and seems an odd choice. Two songs from 'Frozen' could have been chosen and this would make more sense than 'Happy' (though there might be rules against two songs from one film being chosen).Some have alleged anti-Hispanic bias, or even blatant racism, presumably because one character is named El Macho and he runs a Mexican restaurant. A bit stereotypical perhaps, but there was nothing outright offensive. In fact, El macho is shown riding a shark into an active volcano, which is just about the coolest thing anybody could ever do. And the voice actor (Benjamin Bratt) is half-Peruvian...Regardless, this is a great film and deserves a shot at the Oscar, despite the likelihood that 'Frozen' has it on lock.",8,1,1,27 January 2014
Saturday Night Fever," Disco Is Not Dead
","A Brooklyn teenager (John Travolta) feels his only chance to succeed is as the king of the disco floor. His carefree youth and weekend dancing help him to forget the reality of his bleak life.In 1977, disco was alive and well. Today (2015) most would say that disco is dead. But watching this film proves them wrong. The story is as good now as it ever was, and the songs (many supplied by the BeeGees) are quite timeless -- almost every single song on this soundtrack is today considered a classic. Few films can claim such a lineup.From a historical point of view, the movie launched John Travolta, which is interesting... he is one of the more fascinating people in Hollywood over the last forty years. And perhaps it also helped launch Fran Drescher in some way (though she seems to have really not taken off until 'The Nanny').",7,0,1,27 August 2015
The Benchwarmers," Better Than Expected
","A trio of guys try and make up for missed opportunities in childhood by forming a three-player baseball team to compete against standard children baseball squads.When you have a film written by Nick Swardson with production from Happy Madison, you have to expect a fair amount of crude and childish humor. And this film delivers that with boogers, flatulence and midget jokes. But there is also some heart here; as well as the crude level never sinking to the depths of 'American Pie'...Jon Heder is cursed to forever be known for 'Napoleon Dynamite', and frankly he is probably not a strong actor -- he seems to be Napoleon here again, just dressed differently. That may not be a bad thing, as he does perform that role well. Heck, Rob Schneider is pretty much always the same guy and that has worked for him for decades...",7,0,0,28 April 2014
Moneyball," An Anomalous Oscar Pick
","Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) makes a successful attempt to put together a baseball club on a budget by employing computer-generated analysis to acquire new players.I generally agree with Oscar nominations, and at least half of the time agree with the winners. But on this film, I am just at a loss. It is a very good film, but it by no means deserved to get a Best Picture nomination. And Jonah Hill tried to expand his range and escape his typecasting, which is great. But Best Supporting Actor? Hardly.I also tend to agree with Roger Ebert, but he gives this film four stars. I would have stopped at three. He says, 'Jonah Hill's performance is understated and fascinating'. Understated maybe. Fascinating? And his review rambles from there, far less coherent than usual (Ebert's love of baseball seems to have clouded his judgment of on film).If you like baseball, if you like economics, or you like underdog stories... this is a movie to watch. I enjoyed it. I am confused why it got the praise it did, but it certainly is better than the average film out there.",7,1,1,28 March 2012
The Avengers," Great Movie... But Not That Great
","Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.I want to first address the IMDb rating on this film. Currently, it sits at an 8.3 and is said to be the 140th greatest film of all time. Now, no matter how good you think it is, does anyone seriously believe it is one of the greatest films ever made? I mean, really? I grew up reading comic books, so the films are a bit of a different experience for me than they are for others. I think the movies have the comic fans as their biggest base, which is good, because otherwise several references and foreshadowings are going to be missed. If you do not know who Hawkeye is, for example, it may cause you to wonder why a government agent is jumping around and shooting off strange arrows.My biggest concern was: how do you make a movie about a team where the individuals have such strong personalities? Particularly the Hulk, who is not a team player. This was addressed.",7,3,8,17 March 2013
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A Guilty Pleasure
","Treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) looks to discover the truth behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, by uncovering the mystery within the 18 pages missing from assassin John Wilkes Booth's diary.I love history, and thus this film is for me a guilty pleasure. I really, really like it, despite knowing a good bunch of it is absolute baloney. But, I feel that if this film has the indirect influence of causing kids to run out and learn more about history and important figures, that is wonderful. And I suspect this is the case. If I were a history teacher, I would use this film as a tool.",7,0,0,27 December 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Second Half of a Controversial Film...
","After killing her way through the first movie, The Bride now faces her final three foes: Elle Driver, Budd and Bill. The body count drops dramatically and the plot is stepped up, making this the meat if the first film was the dessert.When I saw this film the first time, I was really put off by it. With so much action in the first movie, I figured the same would happen in the second. But instead I was given a slow, steady series of conversations. And this just made me upset. Films don't work this way! You lay down the plot and then build up to a bloody climax -- you don't massacre people and then nap for two hours.But upon my second viewing, I felt more okay with this when I realized that the idea was to give these final characters more depth and that in some ways made it a stronger film. While some conversations go on for too long (Bill's Superman analogy was interesting, but didn't need another fifteen minutes afterward), some are also very nice.Also, I originally was opposed to Michael Madsen's character (Budd) because to me Madsen is best when he plays ruthless killing machines ('Reservoir Dogs', for example). But on the second viewing, I saw the beauty of his character. He is actually more complex, wrestling with sibling issues and at the same time being the only one who seems to have a sense of honor: he knows The Bride deserves revenge while everyone else denies her this. And while he is now a slobbish drunk, at the same time he has turned away from a life of violence. His story would be fascinating.'Kill Bill' as a whole seems like a divider for Tarantino fans. Some people like or hate him altogether (I generally like him). But you will also find those who love 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' (and maybe 'Jackie Brown' to some degree) but will detest 'Kill Bill' for whatever reason. Is it the kung fu versus crime themes? I don't know. But that makes these two films Tarantino's most disliked movies, despite also being critically probably some of his best.Obviously, David Carradine is a great actor for this role, and Uma Thurman (although I am not a fan) works well with Tarantino's style. Daryl Hannah does well, and I am especially pleased with the portrayal of Pai Mei. You're probably not watching part two unless you saw part one (but who knows?) and if you like part one, why wouldn't you watch part two? So a recommendation one way or the other is really not important. But I say go for it, even if you doubted the first part. I think the second takes more patience, but maybe you're the type who appreciates substance over action.",7,0,1,19 February 2007
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Nothing Deep, But Good Entertainment
","Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is in District 13 after she shatters the games forever. Under the leadership of President Coin (Julianne Moore) and the advice of her trusted friends, Katniss spreads her wings as she fights to save Peeta and a nation moved by her courage.Some have said this movie is boring and nothing really happens. I can see that. It has relatively little story, and gets a bit repetitive. Others are banging the drum that this is still a ripoff of 'Battle Royale', and those folks are still totally correct. I managed to enjoy it despite these concerns.My only issue is that I wish there had been more Jena Malone and less Julianne Moore. Don't get me wrong. Moore is a great actress. But she was horribly miscast as President Coin, and it sort of throws the scenes she is in out of balance.",7,0,3,26 July 2015
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," An Incredible Austrlian Cult Film
","Two drag queens (Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving) and a transsexual (Terence Stamp) travel across the desert to perform their unique style of cabaret.Guy Pearce is pretty amazing here. Although not gay, he plays the stereotypical gay guy to a T. He takes what we saw from Robin Williams in 'The Bird Cage' and improves upon it, making it all his own. This is more believable than what Williams did.Terence Stamp is also incredible, playing a total bad-donkey. He is apparently supposed to be transgender, but looks like an old man in a wig. That actually makes him all the more interesting, because it bends the genders in a fun and entertaining way: a man transitioning to a woman, while still maintaining a tough, rough, and pugilistic exterior. Excellent.",7,0,1,4 June 2015
Black Swan," A Bit Over-hyped, But Still a Solid Film
","A ballerina (Natalie Portman) finally gets the big break in Swan Lake as the swan queen. But she starts having mental breaks where her personality shifts more from the white swan to the black swan.The way this film has been hyped as an Oscar film is unfortunate. I just do not see that level of power here. Natalie Portman (playing Nina Sayers) is deserved of a best actress nomination and probably a win, and deserves one for her devotion to the role and the injuries she took during training and filming.Winona Ryder absolutely deserves a supporting actress nomination for her role as Beth Macintyre, and perhaps even the win. Ryder had her glory days in the early and mid-1990s, but I do not think she was ever taken seriously as an actress. While her part in this film is small, I think it is her best work to date.Mila Kunis plays Lily the understudy. I have a personal love of Kunis, and think she is gorgeous. How strong her acting is, I do not know, and I hate to say it, but she may have been the weak point of the entire film and one of the reasons I cannot see giving it a 'best picture' nomination. How she is getting supporting actress nominations from various organizations is beyond me.Director Darren Aronofsky has a respectable career, starting with such critical successes as 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream'. Both of these films I feel is better than 'Black Swan'. Some people love 'The Fountain' while others find it pretentious. I lean more towards the latter. And even here, with 'Swan', I think he borders on the pretentious. There is a fine line between making art and making high-minded bull, and this film teeters on that line.Although I do not think it is as great as some see it, at least I do not hold some sort of intestinal hatred for it like Steve Erickson, the critic for 'Gay City', does. He says the film has 'over-the-top combinations of bombastic music, shakycam, and quick editing' with 'all the soul of a Skinemax exercise'. He finds the film 'not very enjoyable to watch', in part because 'Aronofsky has no gift for eroticism' and 'seems to see sex as a necessary but degrading part of human experience.' Erickson is quite wrong, but this becomes obvious the moment he admits that he finds 'Requiem' to be 'irritating' and never saw it all the way through. What sort of critic can judge a director whose works he has no stomach for?If you do not see this film, I do not think you are missing out. However, it has some strong points and anyone who is a fan of Aronofsky really needs to check this out. That, or if you want to see an emaciated Portman being a sexual creature... but if that is all you watch it for, you are missing the point.",8,2,4,11 January 2011
Changeling," Majorly Impressed
","A grief-stricken mother (Angelina Jolie) takes on the LAPD to her own detriment when it stubbornly tries to pass off an obvious impostor as her missing child, while also refusing to give up hope that she will find him one day.This film impressed me on multiple levels. I had no idea that Angelina Jolie was capable of acting. I mean no disrespect to her, but the roles she had been given never were anything I considered worthwhile. Here, she not only proves herself, she gives 110%. Wow. Out-acting John Malkovich? Yes, yes she does it.The story was captivating, and although some of it seemed far-fetched, it turns out that most of this film was true or at least closer to the truth than most films tend to be. There really was a 'fake boy' and the murders and everything else. I suspect the police corruption was exaggerated a bit here, but maybe not... if Los Angeles was anything like Chicago, they could have been a nasty, brutish lot.",9,2,3,14 November 2012
Come and See," A Soviet Perspective of World War II
","After finding an old rifle, a young boy joins the Soviet Army and experiences the horrors of World War II.Roger Ebert called this film 'one of the most devastating films ever about anything, and in it, the survivors must envy the dead... The film depicts brutality and is occasionally very realistic, but there's an overlay of muted nightmarish exaggeration... It must unfold as a surprise for you. It pretends to roll back history. You will see how. It is unutterably depressing, because history can never undo itself, and is with us forever.' That probably sums it up. This could be considered one of the greatest war films of all time, or at the very least one of the greatest World War II films of all time. The story is gruesome and realistic, and all the more terrifying for focusing on two children rather than the world of the adults. The contrast between 'playing war' and actually taking part in one is so strong that it may have us wondering why we 'play' such games at all...",8,1,2,29 July 2013
The New World," What You Would Expect From Malick
","The story of the English exploration of Virginia, and of the changing world and loves of Pocahontas.There are, of course, historical issues with this film. Most scholars agree that there was no romantic relationship between Pocahontas and Smith. She would have been 10 years old in 1608 when they were said to have first met. So the whole premise is flawed. But in other areas, such as the attempt to have a native language spoken, some credit ought to be given.Ultimately, I found the film to be good but somewhat trying. Malick is a strange director. Obviously talented, but he lets his artistic vision go unchecked. And then it starts feeling pretentious. Other directors could be accused of similar issues (David Lynch?), and I suppose it really comes down to artistic preference. My preference does not jibe with Malick, it seems.",6,2,2,16 June 2017
Scarface," De Palma's Masterpiece?
","In 1980 Miami, a determined Cuban immigrant (Al Pacino) takes over a drug cartel while succumbing to greed.While this was inspired by the original 'Scarface', it is not exactly a remake (something that writer Oliver Stone would not have accepted). Today, Hollywood loves remakes and 're-imagining' films, but they rarely get it right. This got it right -- it is so far removed from the original that the respect and influence are there without taking anything away from the classic.Apparently, De Palma was added as director when Oliver Stone was turned down for the job because of a recent flop. Who would have made the better picture? Hard to say, but it seems great that De Palma ended up with the honor -- this film is in IMDb's Top 250 and the highest-honored film in De Palma's career. If he had made nothing else, he would have gone on to be known for this for eternity. (Stone, likewise, has gone on to be best known for 'Platoon' and 'JFK'.)",8,0,1,12 November 2013
Love and Death," Could Be Allen's Best Work
","When Napoleon invades the Russian Empire during the Napoleonic wars, Boris Grushenko (Woody Allen), a 'militant coward' and pacifist scholar, is forced to enlist in the Russian Army, desperate and disappointed hearing the news that his cousin Sonja (Diane Keaton) is to wed a herring merchant.The film is full of philosophical and pseudo-philosophical commentary. In one instance, a priest suggests that Spinoza proves God's existence. Boris and Sonja banter back and forth about epistemology and such, and only once does Sonja really offer any advice worth taking in: that 'to love is to suffer and to not know love is to suffer', which really amounts to little more than 'life is suffering', something the Buddhists or Schopenhauer would have embraced.But then again, you have wise men spouting off silliness, including the view that German Jews have stripes, and Russian Jews have horns. We are left to conclude, as Boris quickly does, that being logical in an illogical world is a complex and unfavorable situation.It has been said that the use of Sergei Prokofiev for the soundtrack adds to the Russian flavor of the film. Other parts referencing Russian culture include a dialogue between Boris and his father with each line alluding to or being composed entirely of Dostoevsky titles. This is crucial to really get the point of how backwards everything was across.I was not able to fully appreciate the film because I am ignorant of its references to the works of Bergman (notably 'Persona' and 'Smiles of a Summer Night'). But that is true of much of Allen's work, I think. His constant references to Dostoevsky did reach me but may have been missed by others. Yet, even if few completely 'get' the picture, it remains beautiful and humorous just the same. Allen has called this his favorite picture, even more so than 'Annie Hall'. I have to see more to be sure, but as of now I am inclined to agree.",8,2,2,6 April 2010
Howl's Moving Castle," I Actually Rather Liked This
","When an unconfident young woman is cursed with an old body by a spiteful witch, her only chance of breaking the spell lies with a self-indulgent yet insecure young wizard and his companions in his legged, walking castle.By going through the IMDb Top 250 for every year since 1996, I have had the opportunity to see just about every major Japanese animation of the last twenty years. Most I simple do not care for, not really understanding how such primitive animation is considered revolutionary. The fantasy elements are good, but we need better animation.This film seems to be the exception. More than any other anime I have seen, 'Howl' looks like a professional job, with a great story, fun characters, and rather decent animation. Some of it is still choppy, but it has a more slick look than the others.",7,0,2,23 June 2015
Walk the Line," About as Good of a Cash Biopic as We Can Hope For
","I initially had some concerns about this film. First and foremost, I didn't really understand the casting of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Not that they did bad jobs, but just that I think they weren't the most obvious casting choices. However, when I found out Cash had chosen Phoenix personally to portray him, well, I can't really argue with that.I also think they played down the negatives a bit. The domestic abuse is pretty much nonexistent and the drug abuse shows up, but makes Cash seem more like a lovable loser than an outright problem. I understand that Cash's son was a producer on this film, but the true story would be a bit more rough. (That, and the story cuts off with almost forty years of Cash's life left. One thinks there could have been more to say...)",7,0,1,12 May 2010
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The Hype Was Real, This Film Will Be Legendary
","Combining a fictional man (Borat) with factual events, this film shows America to Americans from an outsider's perspective. Sadly, what we find is distressing in the modern era. A country full of people with biases and prejudice, or as my friend put it, 'Borat made fun of all the things that people think matter, and actually really, really don't.' Sacha Baron Cohen continued the 'Candid Camera' pranks he was pulling on 'Da Ali G Show', only stepping up the offensiveness to a whole new level. While this will scare off certain people (jokes about Jews, blacks and 9/11 aren't always well-received), those who are mature enough to understand the context will appreciate the presentation.Borat comes from a world that fears Jews (with their 'horns' and endless greed) and the audience is left to think he is very backwards and a relic of unenlightened days. But by touring America -- and the scenes are all real people, not scripts -- we see that people still hate people for superficial reasons. Religion, orientation, class, gender and race are all held as the keys to what a good person should be. But these are those things that Americans think matter, but don't.The humor is not just a decloaking of America. There's also some fun 'Baywatch' and Pamela Anderson references, and a lengthy scene of male nudity that is both hysterical and revolting (but in my opinion the hysterical far outweighs the revolting). Another scene of male nudity is perhaps even more shocking from the themes it implies. I cannot really say more here without ruining the jokes.The 'great films' each year are dramas or documentaries. Rarely do comedies get remembered as being 'great' critically. But this one might have broken a barrier we haven't seen in almost forever. 'Borat' is not only endlessly funny (the hardest I ever laughed in a theater) but timelessly important.",9,5,15,19 November 2006
Alien 3," Part Three... Still Going Strong?
","Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crashes on a planet populated entirely by prisoners. Her crew is dead, and she must now take up residence among rapists and murderers until a rescue ship arrives. Unfortunately, she is not the only living thing that survived the crash.The question you have to first ask is this: can first-time director David Fincher adequately handle the directing ability after such great films from James Cameron and Ridley Scott? A third film could have easily crashed and burned, but Fincher is a man to be reckoned with and admirably keeps this one afloat. Perhaps not the best in the series, but respectably good by 'part three' standards.Starting from scratch (the crew is dead and the scenery is new), Fincher is free to create his own little world, and he does. This film is less claustrophobic than the first two, but more dystopian in many ways. Also, perhaps more importantly, it is the transition point in the series from science fiction to horror. (The whole series falls into both, but with the levels of blood and gore exponentially larger here, there's no question of this story's genre).Perhaps the only thing that could have been improved was the utilization of the prisoners. There is one minor 'attack' scene, but overall the people could have been any sort of breed and the story would not change. What would have aided this film is a full-scale riot or jailbreak. Imagine Batman having to face everyone in Arkham Asylum -- here it would be Ripley against scores of killers while simultaneously trying to stop an alien infestation! Howard Maxford calls the film 'imperfectly scripted' and Mike Mayo points out his opinion that it 'went through several writers and directors and emerged as a fairly unintelligible mess.' Could it be better? Yes. But I think looking back now, it's not as bad as made out to be.While the theme and feel of the film is not spot-on with the first two, it still is a decent incarnation in the 'Alien' story, and having Lance Henriksen briefly appear kept the continuity strong. You cannot have an 'Alien' film without Sigourney Weaver, but the more you invite back, the better.",7,4,4,12 October 2010
Gremlins," Early 1980s Film Makes Modern Standards Look Weak
","An inventor father (Hoyt Axton) wants to get his son (Zach Galligan) something special while traveling on the road. Just in time for Christmas, he returns with a mogwai (unknown to him, 'mogwai' is Cantonese Chinese for 'demon'). A few rules are broken, and soon the town is overwhelmed with reptilian, green-blooded monsters.'Gremlins' ranks as one of the classic horror films of the 1980s, dark enough to satisfy the horror people and light enough to be funny and almost a family film. The special effects and puppetry, even twenty-five years later, look as good as we can possibly expect. Followed by an equally great sequel, 'Gremlins' has secured itself as a memorable and must-see film.The cast is crucial to the plot: notably, Dick Miller. Miller appeared in many B-movies in his day (such as 'A Bucket of Blood') and casting him was brilliant. Howie Mandel provides the voice of Gizmo, before Mandel was the big name he is today. And Phoebe Cates? Oh my! The darling of the 1980s, and she even appears on screen with Judge Reinhold without taking off her shirt.The action, horror, comedy and cast are held together by Joe Dante, still a fresh face at the time. Steven Spielberg hand picked Dante after seeing 'The Howling' and he could not have made a better choice. Dante will always be connected with 'Howling', but I think it would not be out of line to say this film eclipsed his previous work and may be his masterpiece.I do not know why someone would not have seen 'Gremlins', but if not, you really must. Great for fans of all genres. And I personally suggest purchasing the film on DVD. It is loaded with featurettes, deleted scenes and commentary. The Blu-ray offers no additional bonuses, so unless you're adamant about having up-to-the-minute sound quality, the DVD should be fine and affordable. (This was written in 2010; a new Blu-ray may have come out since then.)",8,1,2,12 September 2010
Antz," Woody Allen as an Ant??
","A rather neurotic ant (Woody Allen) tries to break from his totalitarian society while trying to win the affection of the princess he loves.This cartoon sports an impressive list of celebrity voices, from Christopher Walken to Sylvester Stallone to Jennifer Lopez... not sure if celebrity voices make a film better (it might), but if you like hearing Woody being neurotic, this is another film for you.Interestingly, this film ended up on my list of things to see because it made the IMDb Top 250 in 1998. Since then, it has fallen to 6.6 out of 10, which would probably not place it in the top 25,000. Why it was so highly rated in 1998 is beyond me.",6,1,2,22 March 2015
Requiem for a Dream," A Post-Trainspotting Look at Heroin
","The drug-induced utopias of four Coney Island people are shattered when their addictions become stronger.Following the 1990s heroin epidemic and grunge scene, and the film that may have best captured the period ('Trainspotting'), it seemed like heroin was a dead topic for film, at least for the time being. But not long after that ground-breaker came another one, 'Requiem', which pushed the envelope even more.Darren Aronofsky is amazing. Not simply because he made this great film, a huge undertaking compared to previous success 'Pi'. But he pushed the limits of expectations, just as he continues to do today (2014). He helped cement Jared Leto as an actor, and made everyone believe that Marlon Wayans could be a serious actor.",8,1,3,18 November 2014
Captain Phillips," Not Flawless, But Perhaps Oscar-Worthy
","The true story of Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years.After seeing 'Captain Phillips', I can only call it 2013's version of 'Argo', with a little bit of 'Zero Dark Thirty' mixed in. Although, it is not as entertaining as 'Argo' (with good reason) and not as densely technical as 'Zero Dark Thirty' (perhaps a good thing).While it may be fair to critique the film for historical accuracy, this is one time I am not going to do so. The captain has his story, the crew has theirs, and the military and pirates probably see it other ways, too. But the film is called 'Captain Phillips' and is based on his book, so the film's only goal was to tell his story, whether or not it matches the facts completely.There are two negative things that must be said about the film. The first is that the shaking camera is all wrong. While I understand that this makes sense for hectic, tense scenes, it is completely unnecessary to use at all times. Perhaps the effect was intended to make the audience feel they were really there, but it came across as more annoying and was ultimately a poor cinematography decision.The second issue is how long some scenes run, and as much as five minutes could have been cut. This is forgivable, however, given how much the suspense pays off in the final act. While the audience may get bored if their attention span is weak, they will wake up in the fast-paced finale (which is far more fitting from a director known for the 'Bourne' franchise).With regards to the Oscar nominations, I have no opinion on its three technical categories and cannot fairly judge Billy Ray's adapted screenplay without reading the book (though I think his finished product is quite good and likely deserved the nod).In the acting category, it is surprising to see Tom Hanks get overlooked when he was awarded by many other groups (including the Golden Globes). Between this and 'Saving Mr. Banks', many people saw this as a banner year for Hanks. Hanks is a difficult person to judge with regards to acting because his face is so recognizable and therefore he is seen as Hanks rather than his character. But with the intensity -- and actually getting vomited on for the role -- this was his best work in years and it is unfortunate he was overlooked.Barkhad Abdi has been nominated for a variety of supporting actor awards, including an Oscar. I am torn on this universal praise. While I think he certainly would earn the 'debut' or 'breakout' award if one existed, was he the best supporting actor in 2013? Perhaps not. Abdi will never be an A-lister and may not even pursue further acting, so it is great to see the recognition... but to win? Perhaps not.And as for Best Picture, this just is not going to happen. Despite some strong performances and an incredible attention to detail with regards to how the ship and military operate, this is not a 'best' picture, and its nomination was even questionable. Worth seeing yes, but best picture no. The Golden Globes gave the film four nominations and zero wins; I suspect the Academy will follow a similar decision-making process.",7,16,31,19 January 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Decent Coming-of-Age Tale
","An introvert freshman (Logan Lerman) is taken under the wings of two seniors who welcome him to the real world.It baffles me that kids who are so into underground music seem to have no idea who David Bowie is. That makes no sense. But I completely get what they were about. This is something I can identify with in many respects, liking underground music and being in the outcast clique. We never had gay drama, and I am not big on Rocky Horror (though many are), but I can see this.Not a bad story overall, and it is really driven by having Emma Watson play Sam. With or without her, it would be a good film, but I think she provides the star power and the emotional vulnerability that really sell the character. She is really the only big star in the film, other than those who were left to be little more than cameos (Paul Rudd, Joan Cusack). Incidentally, great casting of Tom Savini... what the heck is he doing here?",7,0,1,30 June 2015
3:10 to Yuma," Solid Remake With the Bale-Crowe Combo
","A notorious bandit (Russell Crowe) is witnessed in the act by a local rancher (Christian Bale). After meeting up later in town, an agreement is made between the police, the rancher and the bandit for the rancher to escort the bandit to the prison train to Yuma. Along the way, they begin to learn and respect each other's life views.What sold this film was clearly the cast -- Crowe and Bale. Westerns do not easily sell themselves anymore, and this one probably wouldn't have made a dent in the box office without the stars. Its value as a remake was most likely minimal. And what interests me about this is how Crowe takes the lead as an actor, leaving Bale to catch up. Bale is often a powerful actor (perhaps among the best in the business, along with Edward Norton) but this is probably his weakest role to date. Crowe dominates, being both an intimidating villain but also somehow lovable.Luke Wilson makes a brief appearance. While he really isn't the best casting choice (his presence always carries a subtle 'comedy' vibe), he does alright. The best support is Ben Foster with the memorable role as right-hand man Charlie Prince. Foster has an unusual voice that made him seem silly in '30 Days of Night', but in this film it works for him to a point. If Foster becomes a bigger actor, it's this film he has to thank for it.The drawback to '3:10' is that there is precious little action for a Western, at least until near the end. So those looking for action are going to receive drama and that may be a disappointment. Personally, I found much of it to drag (though the last third really does improve the action as well as the story overall). If you like westerns, check it out. Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere. Bale fans are going to be let down.",7,1,4,24 March 2008
Skyfall," Daniel Craig Is Not Bad
","Bond's loyalty to M is tested when her past comes back to haunt her. Whilst MI6 comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost.At first, it took some getting used to, because Daniel Craig (despite being English) looks more Russian than anything else. He could be Vladimir Putin's brother, and would make a great Bond villain. But once I adjusted, he was actually quite good at the role, even if not as suave as Timothy Dalton or Sean Connery.And having Javier Bardem as a villain was a stroke of genius. He plays bad guy roles well, and it is great to see him getting more and more exposure for international audiences. Truly a treasure of the screen.",7,0,3,12 January 2015
50 First Dates," Surprisingly Good Sandler Comedy
","Henry Roth is a man afraid of commitment up until he meets the beautiful Lucy. They hit it off and Henry think he's finally found the girl of his dreams, until he discovers she has short-term memory loss and forgets him the very next day.At first, I just liked some of the usual humor: the use of spam to make me believe we were really in Hawaii. And also Rob Schneider, who is often the funniest person in Sandler's films. (He is still good here, though perhaps not at his best.) I was pleasantly surprised that amidst the stupid humor was an actual story about love and the growing bond of two people. There could have been a variety of 'Groundhog Day' jokes. And indeed, there were some. But the character Sandler plays is actually quite sweet. Who knew?",7,7,7,27 January 2016
The Hangover," Funny Film, Not My Cup of Tea, But Pleasant
","Just before his wedding, a man and his three friends go to Vegas, a land of adventure where anything can happen. And in this movie, anything does happen. You'll never believe so much can go so wrong in such a short time. How will the friends be able to recover from such a seemingly disastrous night? I had heard some positive buzz on 'The Hangover' from a variety of people, and figured why not watch it? And I will say that while I'm glad I did, it's not quite on a par with other comedies, despite several humorous and outrageous moments. The first twenty minutes is a bit slow, and although it quickly recovers, I just didn't end up feeling as entertained as I had hoped when it was all over. Maybe the characters weren't lovable or something... I don't know. I see this film's popularity declining in a year or two. I'd much rather watch 'Slackers'.Don't get me wrong. The cop car bit is hilarious, the Asian guy from 'Community' is pretty cool, and the tiger... well, there's a tiger! In fact, my favorite part is Ed Helms' song about the tiger (sometimes referred to as 'Tiger Snooze', though the actual title is unknown to me). Oh, and a Holocaust ring. My biggest complaint is Heather Graham. While she does fine, I just never cared for Graham and I heard that the part was offered to Lindsay Lohan. I much prefer Lohan, and it's a part that could have helped her collapsing career. Oh well.If you like 'Old School' and 'Wedding Crashers', this is probably your sort of film. I don't mind those, but it's not really my favorite. And this isn't exactly the same -- it's not Will Ferrell, it's not Judd Apatow. But, the trend in comedies these days is going in a direction I don't necessarily appreciate as others do. I can't pinpoint it.",6,0,2,2 January 2010
Ghost," You Know You Can't Give Up The Ghost
","Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is gunned down by a Puerto Rican hit-man after stumbling upon a co-worker illegally funneling four million dollars into a fake account. His ghost then tries to avenge the murder and protect his girlfriend Molly, a young Demi Moore who looks like a 12-year old boy. Hilarity ensues when he recruits the worst actress ever, Whoopi Goldberg, to act as a medium between ghost and human world.One evening in January 2006, I had nothing better to do than watch 'Ghost' on the ABC Family network with my sister. And I freely admit it sucked me in. This was my first time seeing the film since being considerably younger, though I recalled most of the plot. I re-watched the film yet again in October 2007 and August 2010.The real fun of the film begins when Swayze learns to touch the human world thanks to Vincent Schiavelli (a character actor who coincidentally died a week before my January 2006 viewing). Not unlike 'Ghost Dad', the challenge is to make things happen in the world of the living while you remain dead. And unlike 'Beetlejuice', you cannot come back by having someone say your name three times.The special effects in this film I always thought were pretty good by 1990 standards. The walking through walls looks fine, and the 'hell spirits' (for lack of a better term) really scared me when I was younger (and even now are somewhat creepy). Sure, the microscope vision when he walks through doors and such is cheesy and was completely unnecessary, but it answers a question some viewers may have had about what ghosts see.I've heard physics people complain that Sam can go through walls and doors and other objects, yet is able to stand on the floor just fine, or even go up stairs. That is a really valid point... but let's just admit it: the plot would be less interesting if they had to deal with such limitations, or brought Sam back as a mere spirit with no shape.Quicker than you can say 'turn me on, dead man' this film will work its way into your heart with a simple, romantic (yet somewhat action-packed) plot and classic song ('Unchained Melody'). You've probably already seen this movie a dozen times, but if not (if you're like my sister) you should see it soon.",8,4,7,1 January 2006
Iron Man 3," A Great Start to Phase Two
","Stark's experiences during the alien invasion of New York are giving him panic attacks. Restless, he has built several dozen Iron Man suits, creating friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the Mandarin has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence.Todd McCarthy wrote, 'After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment... that benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black.' This is spot on. Black brings a sensibility to the table that is perfect for Tony Stark, and recalls the days when Black was writing witty banter for Mel Gibson in 'Lethal Weapon'.",7,0,2,20 April 2014

","Archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is hired by the United States government to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis.Let us tally up what we have here: Great characters, great story, lots of fun with a wonderful tone. A plot that has been imitated and parodied for decades, from 'Muppet Babies' to 'UHF' and beyond. And more than a handful of truly memorable scenes.This film also changed the way we look at archeology, or at least it should have. Each day people are out there digging up treasures, shaping what we know as history. Not unlike how 'Jurassic park' (another Spielberg film) made paleontology relevant, this reminds us how many great things to find are still underground somewhere.",9,2,5,11 November 2014
Spartacus," Of His Work, The Least Influence of Kubrick's on Film
","Spartacus is Kirk Douglas, and he doesn't mess around. He escapes the Romans and wants to kick their booties. Oh, and he has plenty of slaves to help him. Like, thousands. That's a whole lot of slaves.The film is pretty straightforward as far as the story goes -- slaves escape and return to kick butt. But it's some of the dialogue that is interesting. One man debates the moral difference between eating oysters and eating snails. To him, there is none, and that is analogous to sexual tastes... an interesting and probably enlightened perspective.The film is supposed to be anti-slavery, with Spartacus dreaming of a day where slavery ceases, which the narrator says will take another 2000 years. One wonders if Spartacus was all that concerned about the slavery of other races, or if slavery has truly been abolished. Over the years, it has risen again and again in different societies throughout the globe in various forms. Are we so advanced today we have entirely removed the shadow of slavery?",8,0,3,18 March 2010
United 93," Does It Age Well?
","A real time account of the events on United Flight 93, one of the planes hijacked on 9/11 that crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania when passengers foiled the terrorist plot.Roger Ebert, Michael Medved, Peter Travers, and James Berardinelli all awarded the film four stars. It was termed 'one of the most moving films of the year' by Travers in Rolling Stone magazine. The film has even been cited as a favorite by filmmaker John Waters, who presented it as his annual selection within the 2010 Maryland Film Festival.Waters citing it as recently as 2010 is impressive, as I wonder if this film ages well. In 2006, the events of 2001 were still fresh in the minds of us all. But today (2014), unless we lived on the east coast, the tragedy is fading and Todd Beamer may not be a household name anymore. The film, as powerful and important as it is, might be wearing in time...",7,1,2,28 January 2014
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A Defining Film
","A troubled child (Henry Thomas) summons the courage to help a friendly alien (Gordon Shumway) escape Earth and return to his home-world.Say what you will about this film being great, or not so great. There is no denying the cultural impact it has had. Who is not familiar with ET? Perhaps more than any other film up to this point, this is the one that really put Steven Spielberg into people's minds (and hearts).Thirty years on (and counting), the film holds up really well. The effects are excellent, the characters are good (this is Dee Wallace's best-known role), and we got introduced to Drew Barrymore. Anyone who likes Reese's Pieces should love this film.",8,2,5,16 February 2015
Casablanca," Classic Film at Its Best
","In Casablanca, Morocco, during World War II, there is a place called Rock's run by an American where fugitives can meet safely and enjoy a refreshing drink and soothing music. Think of it as a 1940s Mos Eisley Cantina, if you will. And at the center of it all? Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart.It really goes without saying that this film is a classic, and probably one of the most famous and highly acclaimed films ever, as well as being Humphrey Bogart's biggest role. It is quotable, the scenes have been emulated or parodied scores of times... what more can I say that hasn't been said over the last sixty-odd years? So, I will say two things: one, this film loses nothing to time. Despite being a clear period piece (filmed during WWII and taking place as a war film, sort of) it resonates just as strongly today with audiences as it did the first day. And also, it exceeded my expectations. Surely I thought it would be good. But often when films (or anything, really) have something of a legendary status, the hype is difficult to match. 'Casablanca' matched the hype and at times went above and beyond. From the opening scene with the spinning globe, I knew this was going to be the next step in film history -- perhaps 'Casablanca' is the first modern film?",9,2,5,18 February 2010
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Good Old Lincoln Fun
","Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker), the 16th President of the United States, discovers vampires are planning to take over the United States. He makes it his mission to eliminate them.Director Timur Bekmambetov wowed audiences with 'Night Watch' (2004) and its sequel 'Day Watch' (2006), so there was no surprise he had more in him and knew how to make a great-looking atmospheric film.And whether or not the main character is Lincoln, this story puts vampires in a historical era they very rarely (if ever) are placed, and because it is done well, makes this a worthy and memorable film.A special shout out to Mary Elizabeth Winstead who plays Mary Todd Lincoln, a little bit outside the zone for roles she has played thus far. And she plays it straight, making her somewhat comparable to Sally Field. Of course, Field's portrayal was far more serious, but hers was the far more serious film.",7,0,1,9 October 2014
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A Landmark in Animation
","Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is hired to take some naughty pictures of Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme. Soon, Jessica's husband Roger is framed for murder and Eddie -- the same man who just worked against him -- must help Roger prove his innocence and save Toon Town from being bought up by devious capitalist interests.This film combines cartoons with live-action actors, which is both the appeal and the strength of the film. While some moments are less than perfect, for the most part the creators did a fine job of showing how two-dimensional characters would operate in a three-dimensional world. Terry Gilliam has likened the film to 'Howard the Duck' and of course many today could compare the movie favorably with 'Cool World'.The acting is fine all around. Bob Hoskins is great, and all the supporting cast are believable as people in a 1947 film noir world. Many other actors were rumored to be wanted for the role of Valiant, but I have a hard time seeing anyone pull it off like Hoskins did (which, in turn, is now the role he is remembered for). The cartoons are also okay for the most part, though some are annoying. Unfortunately, the most annoying is Roger. If they had to make a new character for this story, why did he have to be so incredibly irritating? The subplot of the 'freeway' is nice. While I would like to think that there was a message in there about how globalization or rampant consumerism is bad, I am thinking that was not really the point and this was perhaps more of a throw away joke. And I do not deny I appreciate gas stations, rapidly-prepared food and billboards as far as the eye can see.I also take issue with Valiant's drinking problem. We never really see the problem (he passes out once, but is probably just tired). Yet, comments about his alcoholism must happen ten or twelve times. Show us, do not tell us. And the 'toon killed my brother' line is great, but it is used like four or five times and we do not need to be reminded. If this were actually a children's movie, maybe they need the help, but I do not think even they are that dumb or forgetful.If you do not see this one, you might be missing out. If nothing else, it is a landmark in animation and set a new standard for how cartoons should look. But if you are from the 1980s or 1990s generation, this is probably already a part of your childhood and you are going to want to see it again for the first time. Maybe it is not 'The Land Before Time' or 'Titanic', but it is one of the more memorable films you are going to see... Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse together on one screen.",8,0,0,8 January 2007
Minority Report," Great Film Despite the Casting
","In a future where a special police unit is able to arrest murderers before they commit their crimes, an officer from that unit (Tom Cruise) is himself accused of a future murder.The biggest flaw in this film is the casting of Tom Cruise. Not that he is terrible, mind you, but it clearly shows the people behind the camera (Spielberg?) were more interested in casting someone who would bring the film lots of money rather than someone who would give the film depth.Luckily, the story comes with its own moral and ethical dilemmas. Is it okay to arrest someone for murder before that murder is actually committed? Attempted murder, sure... but murder itself? This is an old philosophic issue, made popular by the hypothetical idea of killing Hitler (or the equivalent) as a child.",7,0,1,11 February 2015
Finding Neverland," A Bit Dull, But Picks Up As It Goes
","The story of Sir James M. Barrie's friendship with a family who inspired him to create Peter Pan.I have a few quibbles with this film. First being it is not strictly accurate. I feel like the film tried to balance history with fun, but history got the short end of the stick too often. Barrie deserves a good biopic, and this just is not it. I am particularly referring to the absence of Arthur Davies -- his being gone makes Barrie seem even more scandalous than he probably was.I also thought it was rather dull at first, though the second half was much improved. History does not have to be dull -- both 'King's Speech' and 'Iron Lady' are excellent films that present history. This film seemed almost devoid of history... when was it set? How did that impact the characters? It is not clear.But I do not mean to be so harsh, as it actually was a rather good story. Seeing Julie Christie is a plus, and Dustin Hoffman never fails (his role is much too small). Kate Winslet did a more than adequate job, and Johnny Depp was... well, decent. (I find it hard to judge Depp because he has reached that level of stardom where it is easily to see him than it is to see the character he portrays).",7,0,0,19 September 2012
Lifeboat," Very Impressive, Especially Given When It Was Made
","Several survivors of a torpedoed ship find themselves in the same boat with one of the men (Walter Slezak) who sunk it.This movie is not only very beautiful in its story-telling and directing, and in its character development... but it is a great morality tale, and one that could be debated in classrooms or coffee shops. Did the Allies have a reason to trust the German? Did they even have a reason to spare his life? Does morality shift in war time? I think this film is even more powerful given that it was from 1944, when the Nazis and Allies were still at war. Making this film in the 1960s would not have been so bold, although the moral question would still arise. How would this compare today? An al-Qaeda member who had just killed several people? The analogy is not perfect, but it does make you think about the issue differently...",8,1,1,28 March 2012
Training Day," A Look Inside the Los Angeles Police Department?
","'Training Day', to me, seemed a bit far-fetched, at least at the beginning. I couldn't see an officer behaving the way Alonzo (Denzel Washington) does. But he's sort of undercover, so I get it. And luckily, the film takes steps to correct his extreme behavior as it goes on, explaining things more clearly.Denzel Washington is widely considered to be at his peak here, and won an Oscar for his performance. Sadly, I think Ethan Hawke gets overlooked. He put in a great performance himself, and is generally not given the credit he deserves. Maybe he's not as high-profile as Denzel, but the man has been in the business as long time and this film really showcased his skills.",7,1,6,11 May 2010
In Bruges," English Mafia Films.. Here's Another Good One
","After a botched hit job on a priest, two hit men are sent to 'hide out' in Bruges (that's Belgium) until they receive further instructions. However, when those instructions arrive, it's not the happy ending they may have been hoping for.'In Bruges' is pretty much awesome. It has the English mafia mentality of Guy Ritchie's work, with a fair amount of action and violence, but it also has a sentimental side that Ritchie doesn't really touch upon in his tales. These are men who not only kill, but can love... and have their own moral code of right and wrong.Colin Farrell shines here. If he never did anything else, he could still be remembered for this film (he's also decent in 'Dr. Parnassus'). And then you have Ralph Fiennes, who pretty much never makes a bad film, even when it's a sappy romantic comedy. More than any other role, Harry (Fiennes) brings out the anger and the control.This film is 'Snatch' brought to the next level with some of 'The Third Man' thrown in. A few unpredictable twists and turns, and some lively characters that are unique in more ways than one. I highly recommend this film for anyone.",7,1,4,26 April 2010
Chinatown," Detective Perfection
","A private detective (Jack Nicholson) is hired to spy on a woman's husband. But he stumbles on to a much bigger story: corruption, murder, incest... the city of Los Angeles has a powerful elite, but can it be cracked? This story takes place in a world somewhere between 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'L.A. Confidential', and would be right at home with either (or both). While 'Confidential' ranks as one of my all-time favorite detective stories, 'Chinatown' now also gets a spot. It really is an epic and a tale you cannot avert your eyes from.The film marks a turning point in Roman Polanski's career. A step away from art films and British comedies to a full-budget, Hollywood-style film with big name actors. While his other films up until now were for the most part good films, this is the one that probably hit home with American audiences. And considering the script won an Academy Award, it was excellent material to work with. (Of course, 'Rosemary's Baby' was also a hit, but I suspect this was even more mainstream.) Nicholson is great here, in part because he is subdued. He gets a lot of credit for playing violent or insane characters, but gets much less credit for his work as a protagonist without illness. In some ways, this could be considered Nicholson's best work because he carried the film, presented his character well, and did not have to fall back on the crazy facade he has mastered.",9,1,2,19 April 2011
Gravity," Less Than Perfect, But Visually Stunning
","A medical engineer (Sandra Bullock) and an astronaut (George Clooney) work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.Obviously, this film has garnered the attention and accolades it has because of the special effects and visually stunning design. And there is no arguing that this looks amazing, with or without the IMAX and 3D. Some have called it this year's 'Life of Pi' or 'Avatar' and there is plenty of truth to that.Others have been critical of its scientific accuracy, which seems odd. Sure, Bullock is not wearing 'space diapers' and not everything might have behaved how it would in zero gravity situations. But this is hardly the point. The chances of anyone surviving in this scenario are basically nil, so just accept that it is fiction and give them a little bit of wiggle room to tell the story.As for the story itself, I was not terribly impressed. The themes of isolation, desperation, hopelessness and hope are all good ones, and I have to give them credit for providing a fair range for Bullock's character. Others have pointed out the spiritual symbolism, which I concede was lost on me and may be one reason I think it was not the masterpiece others have said.The praise is near-universal, with critic A. O. Scott saying that the film 'in a little more than 90 minutes rewrites the rules of cinema as we have known them.' How do you top that? James Cameron stated, 'I think it's the best space photography ever done, I think it's the best space film ever done, and it's the movie I've been hungry to see for an awful long time.' Which, coming from the leader of cutting-edge film technology, is the highest of compliments.With regard to the Academy Awards, the film earned ten nominations (tying it with 'American Hustle'), many of which are in the technical categories, and it sincerely deserves to win those awards. Director Alfonso Cuaron, known for his Harry Potter film and 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' among others, really went out on a limb here and should be recognized for that. He won the Golden Globe, and I think he deserves the Oscar, too. To helm such a project takes intestinal fortitude few (besides perhaps Cameron) could muster.Bullock as best actress is debatable. Although much was done by computer animation, and thus amounts to more or less voicing a cartoon, the parts she physically appeared in deserve respect and admiration. Bullock stayed in a special mechanical rig for up to ten hours a day, communicating with others only through a headset. That is dedication that was not matched by Amy Adams or Meryl Streep.Best score I could accept, though I do not feel strongly about it one way or the other. Steven Price, at age 36, is a relative newcomer, and it would be nice to see him enter the world of Hans Zimmer and John Williams. But is this his time? Lastly, best picture. And I say no. Much like Ang Lee received best director for 'Life of Pi' but failed to get best picture, I think the same could be said here. The direction and cinematography are excellent, but is this a film that will resonate in years to come? I have my doubts. The emotional impact simply is not there.",7,6,11,20 January 2014
To Be or Not to Be," Powerful Timing
","During the Nazi occupation of Poland, an acting troupe becomes embroiled in a Polish soldier's efforts to track down a German spy.Ernst Lubitsch writes, produces and directs this satire of Nazi Germany. Putting it alongside Charles Chaplin's 'The Dictator', this is a very powerful film because of its timing. Released in 1942, at the height of World War II, when anyone could have won... very brave to make a film of this sort.Lubitsch, a man who inspired the likes of Billy Wilder and Mel Brooks, never had his equal. Perhaps not the most well-known creator, he ought to be. With films like this, he was a true treasure.",8,1,4,4 February 2015
Monty Python's Life of Brian," The Second Best of the Python Films
","Monty Python's 'Life of Brian' tells the story of Brian, a young Jew born in a manger just a few doors down from Jesus. Brian's life runs parallel with Jesus' as he becomes indoctrinated into the anti-Roman People's Front of Judea and is eventually mistaken for a prophet. How will Brian accept his new fame and popularity? What always confused me about 'Life of Brian' is the film's alleged mass appeal. Apparently, it is considered the funniest British film of all time, or at least one of them. Yet, Monty Python's 'Holy Grail' is the one that received deluxe treatment, has a musical developed from it and is most often quoted by other people. Maybe Americans find 'Grail' funny and Brits like 'Brian'. I don't know. But what I do know is that although I think 'Brian' is funny, it's not even in my top twenty for comedies.Graham Chapman shines as Brian Cohen, of course. He was clearly the leader of the Pythons, at least on screen, and rightfully so. He may not have the name John Cleese does or the directing chops Terry Jones or Terry Gilliam do, but he could command a screen. He will be missed.The film is most funny for those who feel a sense of anti-authority in their blood. You can't take the story of Jesus too seriously or this account will offend you. Imperial nations are a target here, as are blind followers of religion. Even the modern Israel-Lebanon-Palestine conflict comes into play, although in a different form than we know it now.Not unlike past work, the best jokes come from over-analyzing situations and words. In 'Grail' we had Dennis explain the anarcho-syndicalist commune. Here, we get an extensive Latin lesson (Romani Ite Dormum). Great material by anyone's standards.In my opinion, 'Holy Grail' is the better film and even 'Meaning of Life' probably has more humorous parts. Not that 'Life of Brian' isn't funny... but I would suggest that only those who enjoyed these other two really give it a try. It's something of an acquired taste, as all British comedy is.",7,2,7,22 May 2008
Se7en," The Essential 'Tracking the Killer' Movie...
","A detective (Brad Pitt) moves to the big city (possibly New York, but never stated) just as another (Morgan Freeman) is retiring. For the last seven days of the retiring detective's career, they must track down a serial killer who bases his killings around the seven deadly sins. Gwenyth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, John C. McGinley, and Richard Roundtree also appear.This film starts out with an amazing Nine Inch Nails remix of 'Closer' over some spooky credits that will play a part in the film later on (but you probably will not make the connection until your second viewing). This sets the tone for a mid-1990s film of nihilistic, dark despair. Unlike another mid-1990s film ('Empire Records') that focused on the pop aspects, this film is for all those who saw the dark side of the decade.That nihilism is evident, and really summed up the 1990s for some (and ushered in the peak of Tim Burton's career, along with industrial music and films like 'The Doom Generation'. John Doe speaks of the general 'apathy' of the world, which came to the forefront in the 1990s, I think, with Marilyn Manson and ultimately ending with Columbine when we were shocked back to our senses. If the 1990s were a color, it would have been black.Visually, the film is stunning, even in the death shots. The gluttony victim, which starts the movie out, is a corpse you will never forget. The acting here is quite good, perhaps among Brad Pitt's best work. There is an odd moment or two, but overall he is flawless. This is likely the film that solidified his career for the next decade (more than 'Thelma and Louise' ever did). Morgan Freeman is great, but when is he not? His mere presence exudes genius.As far as serial killer dramas go, this one is as well written as possible. Another one, '8MM', from the same writer, is also pretty good. But I think this one takes the cake. Other cop dramas with Morgan Freeman ('Along Came a Spider', for example) are also well written. But again, this takes it. The blend of action, humor, dark grisly death and literary intelligence is just superb in its smooth mixture. What other serial killer is using Dante and 'Paradise Lost' as a guidebook? Can I again say the supporting cast is good? Paltrow almost never fails to impress, and this is one of her more vulnerable roles -- a dainty flower in a hurricane. Ermey is his typical authoritarian self, but more reserved here, to his credit. And Roundtree is at the peak of his career, as well -- this may not be 'Shaft', but I think he comes across as a serious actor here in a way he never has before.As anyone will tell you, this film is ranked in the top fifty for a good reason: it is a stellar film. If you do not mind a little blood and plenty of curse words, you will love the intricate and well-woven plot here. I recently watched the film again -- possibly my fifth time now -- and it only grows better with repeat viewings. In short: Delightfully sinister!",9,1,3,7 August 2007
Wayne's World," Good But Dated
","Two slacker friends try to promote their public-access cable show.Although this is one of the better Saturday Night Live movies, and is loaded with excellent cameos and bit parts (notably Colleen Camp and Lara Flynn Boyle), it has the unfortunate problem of being dated. Some of the references are clearly things people understood in the early 1990s but may not understand today. The 'Grey Poupon' reference, for example, is probably foreign to younger viewers.That being said, it is still fun, with Rob Lowe playing a decent villain (even if he looks very out of place). The music is very good, and it may be the last great thing Dana Carvey ever did (sorry Dana).",8,0,0,31 August 2015
Star Trek," An Interesting Parody
","The brash James T. Kirk tries to live up to his father's legacy with Mr. Spock (Z. Quinto) keeping him in check as a vengeful, time-traveling Romulan creates black holes to destroy the Federation one planet at a time.Although I am not terribly familiar with the original series (I was a Next Generation fan), I get the feeling this film exists both within it and not. There are plenty of jokes, many of them cheesy, including the corny 'I'm a doctor' and 'Vulcan mind'...It seems they are setting up this film series as an alternate reality. The older Spock (Spock Prime) is from the world we know, but everyone else is an altered timeline. What does that mean for the series? Are they free to make up their own rules?",7,1,4,22 June 2015
Akira," I Don't Get It
","A secret military project endangers Neo-Tokyo when it turns a biker gang member into a rampaging psionic psychopath that only two kids and a group of psionics can stop.I freely confess I do not understand anime or its appeal. Even if you have a really good story, the animation seems so rudimentary. Are we to praise this film for its story and ignore its lackluster animation? Apparently so. Either that, or most people really like the animation. I just do not see it.But everyone has their tastes. I love some films (particularly in the horror genre) that most people would despise or at least not be entertained by. So I get that not everyone can like everything. Anime for the most part is just not for me.",6,5,10,5 May 2015
As Good as It Gets," A Modern Classic, Despite Helen Hunt
","A single mother/waitress (Helen Hunt), a misanthropic author (Jack Nicholson), and a gay artist (Greg Kinnear) form an unlikely friendship after the artist is in an accident.How can you beat the Shane Black and Lawrence Kasdan cameos? The top notch performance from Skeet Ulrich? Greg Kinnear? Jack Nicholson? Heck, even Helen Hunt, who is darn near impossible to appreciate, actually turns in a fair performance in this film. It pulls no punches.Those who own the DVD will find an unusual commentary track. Very good, very interesting and informative. But it is unusual in that it seems almost nobody was actually in the studio recording it, as the voices come in clips. Kinnear might have been there, and the director probably was, but Hunt seems cut in.",8,0,1,27 February 2015
Citizen Kane," Once Thought To Be The Greatest
","Following the death of a publishing tycoon (Orson Welles), news reporters scramble to discover the meaning of his final utterance.What stands out about this film is the cinematography, not just the concept of 'deep focus' (which puts so much in a single frame, such as young Charles out the window) but also the use of the lowered floor to make people larger than life. For students of film, this is one they must see early in order to fully grasp the importance of the camera.What is also interesting about this film is its rising and then falling star over the years. Disappointing on its first release, booed at the Oscars, and silenced out of existence... it later rose to be considered by many as the greatest film in cinema history. Now, since the 1990s, it seems to be slipping again. Not that IMDb is an authority, but it has fallen from the site's top spot to much lower. How far will it fall?",8,0,2,21 November 2014
Monster," A Fine Film, Could Have Used More Action
","Aileen Wuornos was probably the most notorious serial killers of the past few decades, certainly the most notable female killer. This film brings her story to the forefront, to the attention of the mainstream American audience, who may not otherwise be acquainted with serial killer minutiae.For those watching 'Monster' as a horror film, it may be a bit of a disappointment. There's precious little blood and gore, and even the violence is not the primary focus. It is not one of those low budget, exploitative serial killer flicks. This comes off as more of a drama, and even though Charlize Theron presents Aileen as a 'monster', we have her presented from an angle where we can see her tortured logic, and almost even identify... on at least one occasion, the homicide seems justified.What drew me to this was the inclusion of my love, Christina Ricci, in the supporting actress role. While it is not one of my favorite roles she's played (for those, see 'Addams Family' or 'Casper' or many others), she does it well. She comes off as the naive lesbian girl just wanting to be loved, perhaps too much so. For all the protection Aileen can offer, is it worth the cost? This is a well made film. It's gritty, grim but still watchable. Theron and Ricci give good performances, as does just about everyone else. What makes this film difficult to rate highly is it's inability to be categorized. Not really horror, but a bit dark for a drama... more like a film you'd find on the Lifetime network, only actually decent. If you want a cinematic account of Wuornos' life, this is the one you want... otherwise I don't know who to recommend this one to.",7,0,2,25 October 2009
The Birth of a Nation," The Earliest Masterpiece?
","The Civil War divides friends and destroys families, but that is nothing compared to the anarchy in the South after the war.I wish to use this review as a defense of this film. It is considered one of the most controversial films of all time, and while I do not deny that it has earned that honor, I think it deserves a solid defense from those who would call it racist.The opening frames say the film is intended to show the abhorrent nature of war. And the position given to the South is that it is defending the sovereign right of states. Slavery aside (and we will all agree it is a terrible crime), this is a legitimate position. President Lincoln did violate the rights of states and forced countless Americans to die. Viewed in this light, it makes sense and is understandable.Lillian Gish denied it was a racist film (for what her opinion is worth), and D. W. Griffith himself was by no means a racist. He was personally hurt when accused of making a racist film, and had previously made a film condemning the Ku Klux Klan. His job was to tell a story, not to embrace the perceived message of the story being told.Roger Ebert said, 'The Birth of a Nation is not a bad film because it argues for evil. Like Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil.' Ebert does find the second half of the film racist, but the question remains: through whose eyes are we seeing this story? It is not true history, only the history told in the South.Regardless, it is still the first blockbuster. We have to give credit to a film that runs over three hours, raked in millions of dollars and funded the beginning of MGM and Paramount. We owe the creation of thousands of classic and current films to this one film and D. W. Griffith.",8,1,3,1 January 2012
Memento," The Breakout Film of Christopher Nolan
","A man (Guy Pearce), suffering from short-term memory loss, uses notes and tattoos to hunt for the man he thinks killed his wife.Although Christopher Nolan had previously made 'Following' and a short film, this was easily the film that catapulted him to worldwide success, landed him the Batman franchise, and made him one of the greatest directors working today. Although it may not be a fair assessment, the fact almost every one of his films has been in the Top 100 on IMDb suggests he has a magic touch not seen since the days of Kubrick or Hitchcock.This was also a great role for Pearce. He has been known for 'The Time Machine', 'LA Confidential', and more recently 'Iron Man 3', but I think he will always be remembered for 'Memento'. He was, after all, the driving force behind the film in the acting department, appearing in basically every scene and conveying a wide range of emotions... the fact Pearce is not one of the highest-paid actors in the world is a bit unfortunate, because he can hold his own with the likes of Christian Bale and Daniel Day-Lewis.",9,0,4,20 April 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino Has Finally Made His Masterpiece
","In Nazi-occupied France, the Jews are being exterminated like rats. One escapes... only to later find herself mixed up with a German hero and Joseph Goebbels. At the same time, Lieutenant Aldo Rayne (Brad Pitt) leads a band of Jewish soldiers, not unlike the Dirty Dozen, who roam the European continent and slaughter, torture and disfigure Nazis at every stop. How do these two stories intertwine? Very well, if you ask me.This film seems to be very controversial, which comes as some surprise to me. On one hand, my friend Matt disliked it with a passion, saying it had too much of Tarantino's silliness imposed. On the other, certain people including myself have declared this Tarantino's masterpiece, outshining 'Pulp Fiction' and being one of the best films of 2009, if not the best. Strong direction, and easily Tarantino's best writing, moving away from his pop culture references to more serious fare.The acting is wonderful, setting aside Brad Pitt and Eli Roth (who were great comic relief but not fantastic actors). I didn't even recognize Mike Myers, which is a good thing or I would have been appalled. The lead female Jew (MÃ©lanie Laurent) and the Jew Hunter (Christoph Waltz) were perfectly balanced as strong characters. But the real strength of this film is in the writing, and subtle parallels between different segments of the film.The opening scene features Colonel Hans Landa the Jew Hunter comparing Nazis to hawks and Jews to rats. For me, this screamed of a comparison to Art Spiegelman's 'Maus' where Nazis were cats and the Jews mice. And these connections ran through the length of the film, up until the David Bowie song 'Cat People' played in the third act. While the song did not originally refer to Nazis (I assume), it now fits perfectly with the Spiegelman reference and the inclusion of the line about '1000 years', shortly after the movie has a toast to the 1000-year Reich.This all comes together in the theater scene, when the female lead is looking down from the projectionist booth at 350 Nazis she is about to kill. This is a reversal of the 350 killed from the 'bird's nest' by her Nazi suitor, Private Fredrick Zoller (Daniel BrÃ¼hl). So, the tables have turned, and the 'rat' becomes the 'hawk'. Though, perhaps ironically, the one Nazi she doesn't kill is the very man who massacred her family: he lives to escape to America.There is another parallel between this film and GW Pabst's 'White Hell'. The film figures prominently on a billboard, but is also used by the British film historian to explain his accent. Later on, another character claims she broke her leg while mountain climbing. For those who haven't seen the Pabst film, this is the very plot: a mountain climber with a broken leg. Another friend and I have debated over whether Landa recognizes Shoshanna at their meeting in the French restaurant. He claims yes, as Landa orders her milk and then puts his cigarette out in his cream, a reference to her earlier life on a dairy farm. I feel this is meant to cause tension, but there is no reason to believe Landa would recognize a woman he has never seen face to face and goes by a new name.Tarantino is finally maturing as a director, moving away from his sophomoric days and pop culture fascination. Sure, he still has his moments -- the introduction of Sergeant Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), for example, or using Sam Jackson for a voice-over, or the Bear Jew -- but all in all this looks like a new direction that shows great promise and I expect Oscar nominations to be in the near future.",9,2,11,6 September 2009
Underworld," Vampires Versus Lycans
","Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a beautiful warrior, is entrenched in a war between the vampire and werewolf races. Although she is aligned with the vampires, she falls in love with Michael, a human who is sought by werewolves for unknown reasons.What so you get if you create a world of sleek vampires, make them angry at a world of werewolves, infuse some 'Matrix' mojo, and add a blue-grey lens to the camera? You might think 'Twilight' or 'True Blood' or something else, and you'd be right. Add a butt-load of guns, and you would have 'Underworld'.Is this Kate Beckinsale's breakout role? I mean, I know she did some BBC films or something classy, but if you live in my bubble (the genre film bubble), this is what you most associate her with, sort of like Milla Jovovich in 'Resident Evil'. And with about thirty sequels, why not?",6,1,3,29 July 2016
Coraline," Very Much Neil Gaiman
","An adventurous girl (Dakota Fanning) finds another world that is a strangely idealized version of her frustrating home, but it has sinister secrets.Although I have only read a fraction of Gaiman's work, I think this really captures some of his themes. The focus on childhood being a fantastic age, and the idea of other worlds just beyond the horizon. Mix in the very appropriate Selick-style direction, and you get just the right feel.I would also like to give a shout-out to John Linnell. Without knowing his involvement, I immediately recognized the voice and that made me love the film all that much more. If it is in fact true that They have more tracks that were never used, I do hope they see the light of day. They Might Be Giants is ridiculously prolific, and more often than not succeed in creating wonderful sounds.",8,0,0,3 January 2017
Shakespeare in Love," 1998 Was a Strange Year
","A young Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes), out of ideas and short of cash, meets his ideal woman (Gwyneth Paltrow, not Anne Hathaway) and is inspired to write one of his most famous plays.In smaller roles (but still appreciated), are the great actors Ben Affleck and Rupert Everett. Affleck may not have appreciated a very naked Gwenyth Paltrow pressed up against Shakespeare, as they were dating at the time. But, that is how Hollywood works.1998 must have been a strange year. Although I watched many movies that year, I had not yet caught the 'Oscar bug' and was more interested in the fantastic film genres. In many ways, I still am, but my views have broadened significantly. Anyway... this film walked away with seven awards, including 'Best Picture'. Reflecting years later (2015), was it the best film of that year? Although the category was smaller then (five films rather than today's eight or nine), one jumps out as the better film: 'Saving Private Ryan'. Certainly, it is better known and far more influential. This film, in contrast, is decent but nothing more than a historical love story (with no real history supporting it).",7,1,1,25 February 2015
This Is the End," Pretty Funny, Though May Be Dated
","While attending a party at James Franco's house, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel and many other celebrities are faced with the apocalypse.If you like seeing celebrities playing caricatures of themselves, this is the film for you. Many of the guys involved in 'Superbad', 'Freaks and Geeks' and 'Pineapple Express' have come together to make a film where their friendship is tested by the end -- and it is pretty humorous.Not everything is great. There are dull parts, and the humor relies on the characters being recognizable (for all I know, these guys will be forgotten in ten years). But some of the lesser roles -- Michael Cera and Emma Watson especially -- are well worth checking out.",6,0,2,31 March 2014
Dawn of the Dead," Less Satire, More Action Than The Original
","A nurse, a policeman, a young married couple, a salesman, and other survivors of a worldwide plague that is producing aggressive, flesh-eating zombies, take refuge in a mega Milwaukee shopping mall. Production company Strike Entertainment (who had connections to distributor Universal) pulled out all the stops for this film. Being a fan of the original George A. Romero film, as we all are, I initially had my doubts about this one. As it turns out, however, by avoiding much of the original story, writer James Gunn helps the film avoid many of the comparisons it would have been subjected to. This is, for all practical purposes, a film of its own. And between my first viewing in 2004 and more recently in 2017, it has only grown in stature.Gunn's style of work with Troma ('Tromeo and Juliet') and his later work with 'Slither' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' does not seem to arise much in this film. The humor is more subdued, but I will give him full credit for the Jay Leno / Burt Reynolds target practice scene. Excellent work. To be fair, Gunn actually left the project early to concentrate on 'Scooby-Doo 2', Michael Tolkin ('The Rapture') and Scott Frank ('Minority Report') were brought in for rewriting; Tolkin further developed the characters, while Frank provided some of the bigger and upbeat action sequences. Interestingly, Gunn's 'Slither' was the next project from producers Strike Entertainment.Zack Snyder makes his feature film directorial debut, though he had made music videos for Morrissey and Soul Asylum throughout the 1990s, so he was not a complete novice by any means. Interesting, Snyder was born in Green Bay, which may explain why the film is set in Milwaukee. Assisting him is cinematographer Matthew Leonetti, who started out on 'The Bat People' (1974) but went on to great things with 'Poltergeist', 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', 'Weird Science' and many others.All of the acting in this is great, especially Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames, so there is no need to even get into that. Polley was Snyder's first choice, actually, which was wise on his part. Nobody stood out as the best, nobody fell short... by horror movies standards everything was kosher. The scenery was also great (it is a mall, it looked like a mall, job done). The zombies? Fantastic! So much better than the original in terms of getting the gore and missing limbs down to a science. Blood today is so much better than it used to be. What you may not know is that the special effects were done by Heather Langenkamp, better known to horror fans as Nancy from the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' franchise!There was some dispute between the producers and Snyder about putting Johnny Cash or Richard Cheese on the soundtrack, with Snyder ultimately prevailing. And I say unto thee, you could not have picked two better artists for the soundtrack. The Cash song ('The Man Comes Around') set the necessary mood while the opening credits create the back story, and the Cheese song ('The Sickness') kept the mood lighter when it needed to be (horror films really should not take themselves too seriously). Adding the original 'Sickness' (by Disturbed) was a nice touch. In fact, the soundtrack as a whole really catapulted this film from good to great -- so we have to thank Snyder for that. I really enjoyed the news footage placed in the movie at the beginning and at later times, especially with Tom Savini ('we have a twitcher') and Ken Foree (the televangelist). It really gave the movie a more 'real-life' feel and was a good throwback to 'Night of the Living Dead' with the radio reports, not to mention giving these 'Living Dead' icons cameos.If you are holding back from watching this because you love the original, give it up. This film deserves a solid chance. If it helps, just ignore the fact the title is 'Dawn of the Dead' -- this film rips off the original film much less than other films try to do. At least here, proper credit is given, but it really is a breed of its own.The 2017 Scream! Factory Blu-ray is phenomenal and the only home video version worth owning. Take your old DVDs and sell them. Scream! provides a two-disc set f both the theatrical version and the unrated one, both with new 2K scans. The features are packed in -- featurettes, storyboards, audio commentary, deleted scenes. New to this release is behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with several people, including horror royalty Heather Langenkamp and living legend James Gunn.",7,3,5,17 October 2006
Alien: Resurrection," Joss Whedon Does Alien
","Two centuries after her death, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is revived as a powerful human/alien hybrid clone who must continue her war against the aliens.Roger Ebert felt 'there is not a single shot in the movie to fill one with wonder', later naming it one of the worst films of 1997. The first part may be reasonable, but the second part is a bit much. I mean, heck, this is a Joss Whedon script with the director of 'Delicatessen'. How can that fail? Really, the issue is the tone. As a Joss Whedon film, it works. As a film in the 'Alien' franchise, it feels out of place. Something is off. And not just the nonsense about being able to clone someone with their memories intact...",6,2,3,30 September 2017
World War Z," More Action Than Horror
","United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) traverses the world in a race against time to stop the Zombie pandemic that is toppling armies and governments, and threatening to destroy humanity itself.Classifying this as a 'zombie' movie is much the same as calling '21 Days Later' a zombie movie. The categorization is not wrong, but kit changes what we typically think of when we mean zombies. These are not lumbering oafs. These are lightning-fast creatures that seem to have some sort of collective intelligence, like a colony of bees. Their abilities (most notably climbing walls) are foreign to what zombies are.Also, this should be seen as an action film first, horror film second, which seems to be the case any time Hollywood has millions of dollars to burn on a zombie film. See, for example, 'I Am Legend'. If you are looking to see Brad Pitt survive car accidents and plane crashes while traveling around the world (South Korea, Israel, Wales) this is a fine film. But if you want some scares or a film that embodies 'survival horror', you will not get what you want.Probably the most clever thing about this was the referral of zombies as 'rakshasa', a Hindu demon that feeds on human flesh. Maybe this has already been covered in Bollywood, but it seems that the concept is rather new here. The zombies (or infected) in this film are not actually rakshasa, but it does raise the question: where are Hindu demons in the horror film? If we can have Onibaba and other Asian creatures, why not something from a country with over one billion people? But this is a bit of a sidetrack...Anyway, good film if you want big budget action and Brad Pitt fighting computer-generated undead while sporting the greasiest hair since Kid Rock. Bad film if you want slow, lumbering Romero zombies. But to each his own, I guess.",7,2,3,15 February 2015
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," A Likable Comedy -- Nothing Special, But Decent
","After being dumped by actress Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), a composer named Peter Bretter (Jason Segel, who also wrote the screenplay)tries to take a vacation in Hawaii. But, as luck would have it, she's there with her new boyfriend (Russell Brand). Cue the new girl named Rachel from the front desk (Mila Kunis). Does Peter try to get Sarah back? Go for the new girl? Walk away and move on with his life? Guess you'll have to wait and see.While I didn't find myself rolling around on the ground laughing, and even though most of the plot is incredibly clichÃ© and predictable, I found something endearing about this film. It comes off as a raunchy film -- especially with the full frontal nudity -- but has a lot more character and less juvenile tendencies than 'American Pie' . In some ways, I could almost sympathize with Peter (especially the way he'll eat abnormally large amounts of breakfast cereal).The Mila Kunis was nice -- she's a decent enough actress and very easy on the eyes. The lead was strong. Kristen Bell was a bit weak, but managed to pull off her part. What was really great was the cameo cut-aways with William Baldwin and Jason Bateman. I looked forward to each one-liner, no matter how bad they were going to be. This was really the clincher between a one-time view and a repeat. I'd be glad to see this one again.I was torn on the Dracula musical. It was clever and I think this had a lot of potential, both as a subplot and even as a stand-alone spin-off if they wanted to make it. But I don't know how much I liked the idea of puppets, and when we finally see the finished project I found it rather disappointing. Not something I would go and see. So, Peter, I hope you made Rachel happy because you failed me.Nothing new here, but a classic love tale and some decent jokes with full frontal nudity (male). If you like a good comedy and don't mind some smut, check this out. I suspect it will be better than Kevin Smith's attempt at raunchy humor, and I already know it tops the string of teenager films from the past decade. And if you need a break from Will Ferrell, here's a good chance. Although, sadly, since Judd Apatow produced it, there's some scenes with Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill that I could have done without.",6,2,9,11 August 2008
The Hunger Games," Not the Blockbuster I Expected
","Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) voluntarily takes her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death in which two teenagers from each of the twelve Districts of Panem are chosen at random to compete.Although I have not read the books, I understood the general themes the story was about. There are the games themselves, which seem to have been heavily influenced or inspired by 'Battle Royale'. And then there is the political commentary on inequality -- whether this is a critique of Rome, America today or just this imaginary world is up to the viewer to decide.Jennifer Lawrence is great as usual, and it is nice to see Donald Sutherland in a small but important role. But overall I was actually a bit disappointed. For how hugely successful the books were, and how many people were excited for the movie, I did not find it to be anything really special. The plot is not all that creative and thought-provoking, despite the brilliant ideas they could have run with.Maybe the sequels will step it up with the bigger budget, but this opening attempt did not impress.",6,1,4,31 March 2013
Zootopia," Really Liked It
","In a city of anthropomorphic animals, a rookie bunny cop and a cynical con artist fox must work together to uncover a conspiracy.I hope I don't come off as a detractor for my 7 vote. From what I hear, this is now the greatest Disney cartoon ever, surpassing 'Frozen' as the greatest Disney cartoon ever. But I don't know if I would quite go that far. This one seemed too dark at times, and the message got jumbled -- it was clearly an anti-racist message, but there was still the underlying theme that 'people' had a nature to overcome. Heck, look at the sloths.But there is a lot of potential here with the world they have built. Sequels and spinoffs seem likely, and possibly a television show. Although not a perfect film, it is a giant undertaking that really deserves plenty of respect and more from the characters.",7,2,6,13 June 2016
12 Monkeys," Terry Gilliam's Home Run
","In a future world devastated by disease, a convict (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet.When this film came out, it was huge. Probably Gilliam's biggest success to that time, and possibly still his biggest success today (2014), though he continues to make great films. And looking back on it, approximately twenty years later, it is as good as ever. They took 'La Jetee' and fleshed out an entire world.Beyond the great concept, excellent sets and impressive cast (Brad Pitt in a break-out role) is a story that is so cleverly layered. Is Cole a time traveler? Is he crazy? Is the Army of the 12 Monkeys real? Who are they? And can the future be changed?",9,1,1,17 December 2014
Au Revoir les Enfants," Autobiographical Malle
","A French boarding school run by priests seems to be a haven from World War II until a new student arrives. He becomes the roommate of top student in his class. Rivals at first, the roommates form a bond and share a secret.The film is based on events in the childhood of the director, Louis Malle, who at age 11 was attending a Roman Catholic boarding school near Fontainebleau. One day, he witnessed a Gestapo raid in which three Jewish students and a Jewish teacher were rounded up and deported to Auschwitz. The school's headmaster, PÃ¨re Jacques, was arrested for harboring them and sent to the concentration camp at Mauthausen. He died shortly after the camp was liberated by the U.S. Army, having refused to leave until the last French prisoner was repatriated.Generally speaking, I much prefer the earlier work of Malle. 'Zazie' and 'Elevator to the Gallows' are both great. People tend to like his later work, including this film and 'My Dinner With Andre'. I will give this film credit for one thing: it is uncompromising, and nice to see Malle opted for the French. By this point, he was married to Candice Bergen and living in Beverly Hills, and could have easily made this a Hollywood picture. He chose not to.",7,3,4,9 April 2015
Rang De Basanti," Horribly Overrated
","A young woman from England (Alice Patten) comes to India to make a documentary about her grandfather's diary which was written in the 1920s about the Indian Independence with five young men.I probably missed something, because this film has had a tremendous influence and incredible positive criticism, whereas I saw a bunch of poor acting (particularly from Patten) and some over-the-top Bollywood singing and dancing. Some of the music was good, but overall this just seemed too cheesy to be taken seriously.I would watch the film again to try and understand it better, but that may never happen. It is just so long and difficult to appreciate.",5,7,16,22 December 2014
The 13th Warrior," I Guess I Really Do Not Understand This Film
","From the director of 'Medicine Man', 'Last Action Hero' and 'Predator'... and the writer of 'Twister' and 'Congo'... comes 'The 13th Warrior', starring a Spaniard as as Arab.When I watched this film, I had been drinking and talked through much of the movie. Also, it was on a dubbed VHS tape so the picture quality was not optimal and made the darker scenes a little less easier to follow. However, I still think the film was rather weak.If you want action, with swords flying, fire burning, arrows and horses doing back-flips, you will probably be a fan of this film. There certainly is a large amount of swordplay and epic battle. But in almost every other category, there is much to be desired.I did not find there to be any comedy or romance, very little suspense and the plot seemed absurd. Vikings are in Baghdad looking for an Arab to fulfill a prophesy to fight an ancient evil. This is already odd, but then as the film continued, the ancient evil seemed to be something that could have been defeated with any common army - no Arab necessary - and the movie never explains who they are (although I understand the book makes this very clear). Never mind the fact an Arab can learn fluent Norwegian in a matter of days.The only scene I really enjoyed was with two Norsemen having a duel. While it seemed unrelated to the plot as a whole, I think it added more to the characters than anything else in this film.As I said, if you like a lot of swordplay, this might be a good film to see. But otherwise, I think you would be better off renting something else... this is certainly not the best film from McTiernan, Crichton or Banderas...",4,1,4,2 July 2006
The Impossible," Lots of Suspense, Not a Complete Success
","An account of a family caught, with tens of thousands of strangers, in the mayhem of one of the worst natural catastrophes of our time.First, let us talk about the Oscar nomination for Naomi Watts. I get it. She did a fine job here looking beat up and nearly dead. That probably deserves a nomination. But her performance is overshadowed by that of the young Tom Holland, who received no such nomination. So, to me, if he is not eligible, she should not win. Is that fair? Maybe, maybe not. But that is how I feel -- Tom Holland carried this picture.Beyond that, I have mixed feelings. The tsunami effects were incredible and I really felt the panic involved. But we have here an English family that gets separated -- and they all survive and become reunited within one or two days (I am a bit fuzzy on the timeline). Sure, this really happened (although the family was Spanish -- and I find it odd that a Spanish production company did not use Spanish actors). But it seems too clean, even with all the danger and death.Sure, the film is 'the impossible', which would imply that this should not have happened but did. Yet, to put a basically happy ending on a tragedy that killed 230,000 people seems insulting to me. Apparently others have called it 'whitewashed'. I do not think that is the case -- that term is too extreme -- but I have to wonder why we have to focus on a family who seemingly came out unscathed. Where is a family that did not? Roger Ebert gave the film a perfect rating and called it 'one of the best films of the year'. This to me signals Ebert's growing disconnect with reality. If he means 'one of the 50 best', then yes. But I assume he means more like ten best, and that is just plain wrong.",7,14,23,3 February 2013
Shaun of the Dead," The British Add Something New to the Zombie Genre
","A man (Simon Pegg) decides to turn his moribund life around by winning back his ex-girlfriend (Kate Ashfield), reconciling his relationship with his mother (Penelope Wilton), and dealing with an entire community that has returned from the dead to eat the living.What makes this film atypical of most horror films is that it is not a horror film at all, but a romantic comedy... only it is a romantic comedy filled with zombies and head-crushing action. We follow Shaun, who fights to win his girlfriend Liz back... fights zombies, that is.The humor is distinctly British, and some of the humor relies on a familiarity with the show 'Spaced', which is probably not well known to the general audience. Much of the jokes are also obscure references to other horror films. But most of the humor is universal, as we all probably know what it is like to have a bad day, have a bad job, and have things go wrong with a great woman (or man, as the case may be). And all too many of us know what it is like to live with a deadbeat roommate.The zombie effects are pretty decent, though not as gory as in many films. The humor outweighs the scary obviously. The scenery is great, and many of the scenes are so derivative of 'Dawn of the Dead' that it is hard not to like this film. (Some scenes, some music and even some dialog is lifted directly from Romero... such as news broadcasts and the classic 'We're coming to get you, Barbara.') I enjoyed the multiple times a character was told not to call the zombies 'zombies'... because it calls to mind the great difference between horror movie characters and horror movie viewers. (Horror movie viewers know Romero made zombie films, but the word 'zombie' is not used in those films... even the 'Dawn' remake never once calls them 'zombies'.) I do not know if I would make this a must-see movie, but it is one of those films that everyone has seen, so you probably would not be a true horror fan unless you have seen it, too. And the way it went on to influence zombie films and zombie comedies over the next decade is incredible, culminating in the nearly-as-good 'Cockneys Vs. Zombies', that any 'Shaun' fan should be sure to see. Stephen King proclaimed it was 'destined to be a cult classic.' He was right.",8,1,4,30 October 2006
Argo," Perhaps Not the Best Film of 2012, But A Darn Fine Film
","A dramatization of the 1980 joint CIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of revolutionary Iran.Roger Ebert calls the film 'spellbinding and surprisingly funny.' He points to John Goodman and Alan Arkin as the source of the laughs (and this is undebatably true). David Edelstein concurs, saying, 'Arkin and Goodman have the only colorful parts in Argo. The six fugitive Americans are like glorified extras.' This brings up an interesting point: this is the story of how the CIA rescued six Americans, but not a story about six Americans who were rescued by the CIA. There is a second story in here that can still be told.Ebert further writes that 'Affleck is brilliant at choreographing the step-by-step risks that the team takes in exiting Tehran.' I have followed Ben's career for almost twenty years, starting with 'Mallrats' (1995), and this is the first time I have ever read the words 'Affleck is brilliant'. If this is the last time, I would hardly be surprised.But seriously, Affleck's fall (the Bennifer years) have given way to Affleck's rise. Perhaps the only way he could get higher than he is right now is by giving up acting altogether and focusing solely on directing and producing. Because, for me, the biggest problem -- heck, maybe the only problem -- with 'Argo' was that it starred Ben Affleck. His presence on screen always seems to have a layer of cheese just beneath the surface. (He wanted Brad Pitt for the part... and frankly, that would not have been any better.) As I write this, Affleck has just won Best Director and Best Picture from the Golden Globes, and the film is a contender for Best Picture at the Academy Awards (with Affleck's directing not even nominated there). While I have not seen any of the other contenders yet (and am therefore merely speculating), I find these wins hard to believe. Certainly, the film and direction are quite good and worthy of nomination, but if this was the best film of 2012, I feel like we might have been shortchanged.Although, perhaps I am being too harsh. We have here a story that is well-told, well-paced, well-acted... with elements of suspense, humor and enough realism to educate people about a time in American (and Iranian) history that perhaps is not as not 'common knowledge' as it should be. There was no effort to throw in a forced, pointless romance. Exaggerations only existed where necessary to heighten the tension.I will have to return to this after further thought and seeing other contenders to make a proper comparison. But one thing is for sure: all eyes will be on Affleck to see what project he chooses next.",8,1,1,18 January 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Bombastic Start to a Franchise
","Blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with eccentric pirate 'Captain' Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to save his love, the governor's daughter, from Jack's former pirate allies, who are now undead.Although he has been around since the early 1980s, and has made such great films as 'Edward Scissorhands', this is now the role Depp is best known for. And, as of now (2015) it may remain that way, as his career seems to be in idle any time he appears as any other role (though his Wolf in 'Into the Woods' has its charms).Worth pointing out is how this film has one of the finest scores ever recorded for a Hollywood movie. Even if the soundtrack existed and the screen was blank, the film would deserve credit just for the score. Not many films could claim this, but 'Pirates' can.",7,0,2,22 January 2015
12 Angry Men," Deservedly a Top Ten Film
","A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court.Today's audiences will find a young Jack Warden, perhaps now best known as Big Ben from 'Problem Child', and Wisconsin-born John Fiedler, whose voice is recognizable as Piglet from 'Winnie the Pooh'. Along with Ed Begley and Henry Fonda, you already have a strong cast (and the other eight men are no slouches).This film is timeless, both as a tribute to great actors of their generation, but also as a testament of the greatness of the American justice system. One likes to think this has inspired at least a few people to approach jury duty with the utmost seriousness and give the concept of 'reasonable doubt' a run for its money.",9,1,2,30 September 2014
Beauty and the Beast," Middle of Disney's Golden Age
","Belle, whose father is imprisoned by the Beast, offers herself instead and discovers her captor to be an enchanted prince.This film was right in the middle of Disney's golden age, sandwiched between 'Aladdin' and 'Little Mermaid', pushing the boundaries of digital animation (just a few years before Pixar blew Disney out of the water). And the songs... definitely quite memorable.For me, Belle is the best princess Disney has had to date. While not an outright feminist role model like 'Brave' was intended to be, she is a woman whose strengths are not in physical beauty, but in her intelligence. I think that was a great decision. Sure, she is not ugly, but the focus was on her being more than just 'a prize to be won'.",8,0,0,25 July 2013
The English Patient," More Than a Romance
","At the close of WWII, a young nurse tends to a badly-burned plane crash victim (Ralph Fiennes). His past is shown in flashbacks, revealing an involvement in a fateful love affair.This movie tends to get billed as a great romance, and maybe that is fair. But it also happens to be much more, with Willem Dafoe playing a Canadian spy. Wait, what? So this is a spy thriller, too? Well, not exactly. But Dafoe does the part well, coming off as nasty and jealous. Which, really, suits him rather well. (How would Bruce Willis have done in the same role?)Ralph Fiennes looks good in the burn makeup... could it be this is what helped him land the role of Voldemort? I would not be the least bit surprised.",6,1,3,19 May 2015
Hostel," This is Not the Gore it was Made out to Be
","I think Quentin Tarantino should not put his name on horror movies anymore. He may have presented this film, but it ruins his name to be attached to projects like this. Especially when you combine this film with the endorsement he gave 'Wolf Creek', which almost everyone seems to have despised.Now, this film was presented as a gore film. It was not a gore film. There was gore, but if you watch movies like 'Saw' and 'Saw II' and expect this to be on the level, you'll be let down. You might have heard a certain scene was intense. But you were probably lied to, because most of the violence seems so fake. I don't know what dangling eyeballs look like, or what it's like to get run over by a car traveling five miles per hour. But I don't think it looks like this.Also, you might have been told it's a film about a place where you pay to hurt people. Yes, that's in this movie. But only for about twenty minutes. The first half hour (time it on your watch if you doubt me) is just a variety of sex scenes and naked women. I like naked women, but I have no idea what any of it had to do with making a horror film.It wasn't an entire waste. The idea was decent and some of the characters were interesting. The American client is cool, the Dutch businessman is creepy and there's a surprise cameo by Takashi Miike (the director of several Asian horror films which have been banned for excessive disgustingness).I guess you may as well see it if you wanted to, but there are other films I'd recommend first. 'Saw II' and 'Hills Have Eyes' should be seen first.",5,1,2,4 May 2006
Happy Gilmore," Fast-Paced and Relaxing Sandler Film
","If you don't like Adam Sandler, you won't like this film. But that should be obvious. This one is not as laugh-out-loud funny as 'Billy Madison' nor as subtle in its witty humor as 'Wedding Singer', but is one of the easiest to watch for just winding down after a long day.Happy Gilmore is a hockey player who has no future in hockey. So he becomes a golfer instead (not unlike the guy from 'The Cutting Edge' who became a figure skater). Luckily, he's a very good golfer because he needs the money to save his grandmother's house from being repossessed so she can escape from Ben Stiller's sadistic nursing home.Again, you won't get any over-the-top laughs like the singing clown from 'Billy Madison' and no obscure references like 'Wedding Singer', but lots of little jokes to keep you going. Most memorable is the fight between Adam Sandler and Bob Barker, which is probably not only one of the film's best moments, but no doubt created a resurgence in 'Price is Right' fans among the college age demographic.And then there's the appearance of a ghost of Abraham Lincoln, which is either completely nonsensical or some very subtle racial joke. Oh, and then there's the midget on the tricycle. Does it make sense? No, but it does not have to.In my opinion, the film is not worth owning (I'd rather own 'The Wedng Singer') but is still one of those you can watch again and again because of its light and fluffy nature (sort of like Jell-O). And who doesn't want to help save their grandmother?",7,1,2,24 September 2006
The Notebook," One of Those Love Stories That Will Go Down in History
","Noah Calhoun sees Allie Hamilton across the fairgrounds and falls instantly. He persuades her to date him, and before long a summer romance blossoms. But can a love survive class differences, a world war, an evil mother and years of time? If you believe in love -- true love -- this is a film you have to see.I watched this movie for the wrong reasons with the wrong person, and liked it anyway. The wrong reason was because of the persistent rumor that you could not watch this movie without crying. Especially if you cried during 'A Walk to Remember'. Well, I streamed tears pretty heavily during AWTR, much to the amusement of my girlfriend at the time. But I did not cry at all during 'The Notebook'. Though the person I watched it with was a bit moist in the eyes. That person was my good friend Kenn, which I think made the film less sentimental because he's not exactly the person I ideally wish to cuddle up with.I loved Ryan Gosling in this film, especially with the righteous beard. I'm not so sure about the casting of Rachel McAdams, though. I'm quite certain her character was supposed to be as air-headed and annoying as she is, but I just didn't find her likable or attractive. Gosling could have done so much better. (But I'm a Mandy Moore fan, so I'm a little biased.) The basic elements of love are here: don't listen to your parents, don't worry about money. Follow your heart. True loves conquers all. It's not a new story in any way. Sure ,you don't find many films with guys who climb moving ferris wheels, but the basics are here. The other plot, of a woman who lost her memory, is very emotional, but not very riveting for me. I just didn't really care about her (which is probably another reason I didn't cry). But yeah, even 'The Incredible Hulk' has a love story, so it's not like this is unique.When it comes down to it, if you need a romance movie and you want some sadness and heartbreak and a good cry, I guess you'll want to watch this. Don't be expected to be blown away like others would tell you. Critically speaking, it's not a dynamo. But emotionally, if you're the sort who loves a timeless story of true love, this ranks up there with 'The Princess Bride' (though it's not nearly as funny).",7,1,3,29 August 2007
Public Enemies," This Film is an Embarrassment
","The Feds try to take down notorious American gangsters John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd during a booming crime wave in the 1930s.As a native of Wisconsin for 31 years, I was a bit proud to have this film shot in Columbus, Oshkosh and Manitowish. I have walked these streets, seen the sights. Heck, I've spent many hours at the coffee shop and comic book store in Oshkosh where a scene was done. But sadly, the finished product is a disappointment.The movie begins with too much 'shaky-cam'. It is not artistic and it is not effective. It is more annoying. And from there, it sort of devolves. Johnny Depp, as much as we may love him, is not John Dillinger. He neither looks like him, nor is he the right sort of personality. Christian Bale made an alright Purvis, though.I also found the movie to be an insult to the book. While it may be 'based on' the book 'Public Enemies' (which is an excellent book), it deviates so widely from it that this is more fiction than fact at times. The Little Bohemia incident is exaggerated, including a car chase that happened in a completely different time and place. Billie Frechette's role is enlarged, giving the film a romantic angle it should not have and creating this myth that she was beaten or was the subject of a secret message.The most egregious change is the scene with Dillinger walking into the so-called 'Dillinger Squad' office. While it may well be true that he once entered the same building as the police department, he certainly never walked up to the police and started talking about baseball! The plastic surgery part of the film is removed, and Frank Nitti's role is increased. We also get much more Phil D'Andrea than probably necessary. Dillinger had minimal interaction with the Mafia. To try to inflate their part (without even adequately explaining who they are) is just a mistake, making the story convoluted and even more in error.If you like gunfights, this film is okay. But for a story, action, and a good Dillinger... I recommend seeing the movie 'Dillinger', directed by John Milius. It is the supreme telling of this story.",6,0,1,14 July 2012
The Babadook," One of the Best Horror Films of 2014
","A single mother (Essie Davis), plagued by the violent death of her husband, battles with her son (Noah Wiseman)'s fear of a monster lurking in the house, but soon discovers a sinister presence all around her.Some people find this film terrifying, some just find it eerie. If nothing else, it stands out as original. Writer-director Jennifer Kent hits a home run, taking what she learned from her very unusual film school (watching Lars von Trier) and incorporating it here. But it is so much more than good direction and excellent framing.This is a film that could fail if the elements were off. If the creature effects were cheesy, it would not be as scary. If the mother was not as convincing, it would not be so emotional. And Noah Wiseman? Wow. Few child actors are able to perform on this level. The last one with this much talent that comes to mind is Chloe Moretz. Give this kid more roles, and give them to him now.",7,4,7,25 May 2015
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Groundbreaking
","When the four boys see an R-rated movie featuring Canadians Terrance and Phillip, they are pronounced 'corrupted', and their parents pressure the United States to wage war against Canada.Although by now (2015) 'South Park' is a marginal show and largely forgotten, it was a big deal in the late 1990s and early 2000s, reflecting back on American culture in a smart, cynical and timely manner. Often viewers would be impressed how quickly a real-world situation could be transformed into an episode.With the film, they did this and so much more. Not only did they mock themselves for being the biggest adult cartoon of the time, but they did it as a musical, and even got nominated for a Grammy. (Did they win? No. But still.)",8,0,0,16 March 2015
The Danish Girl," A Second-Tier Oscar Film
","A semi-fictitious love story loosely inspired by the lives of Danish artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. Lili and Gerda's marriage and work evolve as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a transgender pioneer.As far as Oscar reviews go, this one will be a little bit shorter. The film has four nominations, and it has only a slim chance to win any of them. For Costume Design and Production Design, it seems very unlikely that the film has a chance at all. On the costume, perhaps, because they had to effectively dress am an as a woman. But this seems more like it would have fallen into hair and makeup. I suspect no win here.I would love to see Best Supporting Actress for Alicia Vikander, especially because she should more properly be seen as the lead actress and not simply a supporting part of the film. In many ways, this is just as much the wife's story as it is the husband's. Vikander dominated, and although I would have to give serious thought to it, she may just have my vote. But this is one of the tougher categories this year, with Jennifer Jason Leigh (Hateful Eight) seen as a likely winner, and Rooney Mara (Carol) probably giving her best performance yet. So my heart is with Vikander, but my head says it is unlikely.Which leaves Best Actor for Eddie Redmayne. He won last year portraying Stephen Hawking, and he has followed it up with something almost as good. It is one thing to put on makeup and a dress. Anyone can do that. But he transforms himself completely into Lili, and has a character that is bursting with emotion and a possible mental instability. (This may give the wrong impression for transgender people, but Lili is portrayed less as a woman inside a man and more as a split personality.) Redmayne would love to win back-to-back, and in many years this would be quite possible. But all the buzz says Leonardo DiCaprio is walking away with the award for his role in 'Revenant'. Personally, I believe Redmayne put more of himself into his role than DiCaprio did. But I do not expect the forward momentum to change... this is 'Leo's year', and when the awards get announced, expect him to be the one with the statue, not Eddie.",7,0,1,9 February 2016
Elizabeth," Historically Epic
","A film of the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I of England (Cate Blanchett) and her difficult task of learning what is necessary to be a monarch.Although I know relatively little about Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and just as little about Elizabeth I, their stories tend to make good film. Shakespeare knew royal lives made good plays and the tradition continues still in the 21st century. We may focus less on Henry VIII and more on modern figures (see 'The King's Speech'), but the lives of royalty always fascinate.Is this an accurate portrayal? Well, no, of course not. We could never truly know the personality of Elizabeth or the conversations she had, especially behind closed doors. But in a general sense this is the case. She inherited a mighty throne, and not at the best possible time.",8,0,0,30 March 2015
Oldboy," South Korea's Violent Masterpiece?
","After being kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years, Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find that he must discover the reason for his capture in five days.I am a bit surprised to find this film in the top 250. Not that it is not a good film (it is), but it does not seem like the sort of thing that would get the honor. I suppose, certain plot elements aside, it has incredible cinematography (both in movement and color) and excellent directing. The acting is fine, as well.The violence is hard to categorize. On one hand, some of the bloodiest scenes call to find the films of Takashi Miike. But Miike lacks a certain sensibility that Park does not -- this may be a revenge film, but it is also beautiful in a way. The violence, at times, comes off like a well-scripted choreography. Where Miike tries to shock the audience and push the limits, Park seems content to stay just on the edge and make sure it is done in good form.The biggest problem with this film is that it suffers from the same issue that 'The Sixth Sense' did. While 'Oldboy' has many twists and surprises, one of them will probably be told to a viewer before he or she watches the movie. And that is unfortunate. Does it ruin the movie to know twists in advance? Maybe not. But it might be best to have things revealed as the story intends them to be.All in all, a solid film. If I had any complaint, I could say the film was a bit long. But the pacing was steady, so it was not an unenjoyable longness. Not for all audiences, this film should be seen by those who can appreciate it.",8,2,6,28 December 2011
The Secret in Their Eyes," The Best-Selling Argentine Film
","A retired legal counselor writes a novel hoping to find closure for one of his past unresolved homicide cases and for his non-reciprocated love with his superior - both of which still haunt him decades later.So, this is the best selling Argentine film of all time. And the first one to get the Blu-ray treatment. One can see why, as it is a beautiful movie with plenty of twists and more than a little grit. Any movie where a character takes his privates out of his pants and flops them around is okay with me (though they look very prosthetic).I would recommend this film to others. Does it deserve to be on the IMDb Top 250? Not necessarily. But if someone had an interest in South American film, they would be foolish to skip over this one.",7,0,2,23 June 2015
Billy Elliot," Not My Cup of Tea
","A talented young boy (Jamie Bell) becomes torn between his unexpected love of dance and the disintegration of his family.Although this film is alright, it just really did not appeal to me. I have no real interest in ballet or dancing, so I could not connect with the main character. I understand the theme is broader than that -- that we all have talents and need to bring them out. That is a good message. Just did not hit me hard in this film.What is even more interesting is how much discussion this film seems to generate about sexuality, and whether or not Billy is gay. Some say he is, some say he is not. The real answer seems to be: why does it matter? Especially when you consider he is supposed to be 11 years old. His sexuality should not be anyone's concern!",6,0,3,3 March 2015
The Fifth Element," Better With Age?
","In the colorful future, a cab driver (Bruce Willis) unwittingly becomes the central figure in the search for a legendary cosmic weapon to keep Evil and Mr Zorg (Gary Oldman) at bay.Does this film get better with age? I recall seeing it around the time it came out, and while not necessarily disliking it, thinking it was a rather stupid movie. But seeing it again now (April 2015), it seems to me much more clever than I initially thought (though still with a high degree of stupidity).Some of this just should not exist. The clothing and hairstyles are silly and distract from the film's strengths. The aspect of the mother could also be removed. But really, there is a very clever script under all this. The alliances and connections between the military, the cab company, the bad guys, the religion... it is surprisingly complex and yet still rather simple. Quite clever.",6,4,6,20 April 2015
127 Hours," Second-Tier But Still Great 2010 Film
","Aron Ralston (James Franco) is an amateur mountain climber. After setting out on his own, and not telling anyone where he went, he finds himself in the most awful of tragedies: his arm is trapped under a rock, and there is no possible way to call for help. What lengths will he go to in order to survive? The story is familiar to anyone who has followed the news in the last ten years. But here we are given a closer look than we ever thought possible. And if you are wondering if it is possible to make a film about a man who does not move and has no one to talk to for 127 hours, it can be done, and be done in style.I do not think Danny Boyle was the right man for the job on this one. Not to say he did a bad job -- he did not -- but he has a unique style that I think this film did not need. There are a lot of colorful things that need not be there. Some may like this.I also do not think Franco was given a full range to work with. That being said, I would still give him a best actor nomination, even if he would not win. It is not often that one man can carry a whole film, and he did it. He had to, and he did. I never got bored despite the very limited scenery.This is a bit more of an artsy film and will not gain the amount of attention that other films -- 'Inception' and 'Social Network' -- will get. And it is not Boyle's best film, certainly. But if you have an urge to see Boyle's latest film, or one of the top films of 2010, make this a must-see.",7,3,6,13 January 2011
Batman Returns," Still a Great Film
","When a corrupt businessman (Christopher Walken) and the grotesque Penguin (Danny DeVito) plot to take control of Gotham City, only Batman (Michael Keaton) can stop them, while the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) has her own agenda.First of all, this cast is amazing. Setting aside the supporting actors (including the great Paul Reubens), the four key roles make this an instant classic for any movie fan, regardless of their love of Batman.But also, I think Tim Burton 'got' Batman in a way no other director has. Christopher Nolan's films may be the best from a critical standpoint, but Burton's are best at visually blending the comics and reality. His world is dark, but still fun. Nolan's Gotham is a hopeless land.",7,2,9,8 December 2013

It is so well known, and so well loved, that I have no reason to praise it. Do I really need to convince anyone that this is a great film? Do I need to explain why? If I had to say anything, it is that this was probably the film that got people to fall in love with Ellen Degeneres. I feel like her sitcom and subsequent talk show were popular, but not hugely so... this role probably broke her through to a wider audience and a new generation.

","Eric Brooks (Wesley Snipes), better known as Blade, is a half-human, half-vampire 'daywalker' with all the advantages of being a vampire without most of the side effects (though he still craves blood). As such, he has made it his mission to stop the evil vampires (led by Stephen Dorff and Udo Kier) with the help of his sidekick, Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). As an age-old prophecy comes to fruition, time is of the essence to stop the vampires now... Traci Lords also appears.This film works, and I'll tell you why it works... because it is a vampire-inspired retelling of the Patrick Swayze classic 'Road House'. Both films feature tough but sensitive leading men who travel from city to city to bust up groups of hooligans intent to make life miserable for those around them. Both has sidekicks who looks like urban cowboys. Both of them have that sidekick killed by the hooligans, leading to greater revenge. Both have the romantic interest be a doctor, specializing in a field that helps the hero (surgery for Swayze, blood for Blade). There are some obvious differences, but the general theme is more or less the same... this is Swayze's Dalton character if he were a vampire hunter.And that's really the selling point of this film. Sure, the vampires are cool and the story is cool. And Stephen Dorff is incredibly cool. But if you don't look at this film through the lens of 'Road House' you'll be forced to look at through the lens of 'The Matrix' with all the stunt fighting and bullet-dodging, not to mention the ubiquitous late 1990s techno music which seems like it was stolen directly from 'The Matrix''s soundtrack. And any film that falls into this trap has no chance to survive in the long term.Did I like this film? Heck yeah, I really enjoyed it. Vampires, Udo Kier, Stephen Dorff and Wesley Snipes' best role since 'Demolition Man' (though still not quite as good). Traci Lords was here (but unfortunately over eighteen). If you like vampires and you like action films, this is probably the best you're going to get... I can't really think of another film. And as far as comic adaptations go, this was one of the better ones, opening the gateway for the hugely successful Spider-Man and X-Men franchises.",7,0,2,15 November 2007
Superbad," The Spiritual Successor to Can't Hardly Wait
","High school seniors Evan and Seth (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera), who had spent their years pining for girls but never chasing them, are about to graduate and go their separate ways, worlds apart. But before they go off to college, it's time for that one last high school party. The booze, the women and more... they are ready to become adults.Let me lay it out there: 'Superbad' is the spiritual successor to 'Can't Hardly Wait', which is the spiritual successor to 'Say Anything'. This is a blessing and a curse. The blessing is we have the same concept that works time and again: the end of the high school years and a big party where the losers and nerds have to redeem themselves. Lloyd Dobbler (John Cusack) did it with Ione Skye, Ethan Embry's character did it with Jennifer Love Hewitt. Now Seth and Evan have that chance with Becca and Jules (Emma Stone). And this formula always works. (Also, these films tend to have good music. 'Superbad' really taps the Bar-Kays, which is a wise move and a dang fine opening song.) The bad? Each reincarnation seems to be weaker, a copy of a copy (like 'Multiplicity'). I liked 'Superbad', but it didn't have all the iconic moments 'Can't Hardly Wait' had. And before that, 'Say Anything' will always be remembered for the boombox scene with Peter Gabriel. Even the best scenes of 'Superbad' are disposable, and some of the best jokes (drunk cops, for example) are nothing new. The only really great parts are the rambles between Evan and Seth.As a side note, I have to call attention to the girl who played Becca and state for the record how hot she is and how I feel she has a strong future. She's like the younger Alysson Hannigan, which we needed. And by being cast in the remake of 'Last House on the Left', her acting career is cemented so long as they are able to make that film half as powerful as the original (a difficult task).I highly recommend 'Superbad', though if you're looking for a 2007 teenager movie, 'Juno' should really be your primary choice. And if you like Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen, I cannot say that this is better than 'Knocked Up'. Maybe marginally, but only because this has more repeat viewing value. And I do fear that future collaborations will simply diminish... Judd Apatow is a ticking time bomb (though still strong as of July 2010).",6,0,3,24 March 2008
Creed," Despite Flaws, Could Reinvigorate the Franchise
","The former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan), the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed.This is one of the most divisive films of 2015, it seems. A fair number of people think it is brilliant and was snubbed by the Oscars. Other than Stallone's nomination, it has nothing to speak of. Some say it could have been Best Picture (I don't). And there is an argument to be made for cinematography, because the fight scenes are incredibly well shot, jumping in and out of the action smoothly.Then there is a group who thinks the film is awful, pointing out the obvious: this is very much a rehash of the original 'Rocky' film in many ways. We have the underdog who rises quickly to the top. And in some ways this is not even as spirited, because Adonis is coming out of a home where money is not a problem. He does not need to fight. He could loaf around, and as we see early on, he can quit a good job without a care.Adonis is also a hard character to be supportive of, because he has everything handed to him and it all comes so easy. He does not lose a fight, he gets Rocky on his side without a struggle, he finds a supportive girlfriend who stands by him even when he is awful. Where is the struggle? Where is his heart? But let us not be too harsh. Instead, we will shift gears to Stallone. How about that supporting actor nomination? Indeed, he does pretty good here, and this may be the most emotion we have ever seen out of Rocky Balboa. Some of it seems out of character. Compared to the early films in the series, Rocky somehow got a little smarter (though he still cannot spell). And some have said he gives up a bit too easily on things, notably his health, for a man who is always about the fight. (I am less convinced of this point. His reasoning seems valid.) I would not expect Stallone to win. He does great, but we have seen Rocky before... six times before. And when up against Mark Ruffalo and Mark Rylance, it seems unlikely. He may edge of Christian Bale and Tom Hardy, but still... the category is not his this year.",7,0,5,22 February 2016
The Great Dictator," A Scathing Attack on Nazi Germany
","This is the story of a Jewish barber and another Gentile man who happen to look alike (both played by Charlie Chaplin). One grows up to become a ruthless dictator, the other feels the wrath of said dictator for being Jewish, despite his military service.Aside from being funny (which it is), the film really attacks Hitler and Nazi Germany in a very direct way -- there's no denying the target. And to do so in 1940 (or earlier, if you consider when filming started) was a bold move. America wasn't at war yet, and to my knowledge there wasn't a big outcry about the treatment of the Jews. So Chaplin was really ahead of his time here.The film was robbed at the Academy Awards, but that's typical... there's always some scandal there. Looking back, I think Chaplin won in the long run... this film stands as one of the greatest of all time, and has easily eclipsed that year's winner, Hitchcock's 'Rebecca' (which has failed to match the legacy of other films that year -- 'Grapes of Wrath' and 'Philadelphia Story').",8,1,2,6 April 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A Fair Balance of Good Film and Bad
","Where did Wolverine come from? How did he get his adamantium skeleton and claws? If these are questions that troubled you, you're a dork. Also, you're a dork who never read the comics, since you'd already know the answer if you had. But for those who haven't read them and are still curious, this film explores Wolverine's days before there was such a thing as the X-Men.This film has been receiving many, many poor reviews. Some have called it cheesy, others bland, others repetitive. I can see all that. And I'm not going to lie and say it was a great film, because it really wasn't. But was I entertained? Actually, yes. For what they had to work with, I think the outcome was pretty decent -- this is, after all, the fourth film in the series. Success cannot be maintained forever.I appreciate the great inclusion of relatively obscure characters -- such as John Wraith. The writers clearly cared about the comics, so we have to give them credit for not trashing them entirely. Silver Fox? Never thought I'd see her in a movie. So, this was pretty cool in that regard. But then, things got a bit weird.I'm not sure about young Cyclops, and the Deadpool story fails entirely. Deadpool has been one of my favorite comic characters for many years, and what they bowdlerized him into is just terrifyingly stupid. I can understand Ryan Reynolds as a casting choice, even if I'm not a fan, but what they turned the actual character into as the film progresses... what the heck? As I said, young Cyclops was strange -- the attempt to add in other characters just seemed lame. The Blob? Really? And Gambit, although popular in some circles, had no real point to being in this movie... and wasn't a terribly interesting guy.Fans of the three 'X-Men' films will likely see this, and perhaps enjoy it. Or be let down. I guess it could go either way. Sales on this one seem to be slumped, yet I wouldn't be surprised if one more film in the series was made. With the success of 'Iron Man', the 'Spider-Man' movies and more, Marvel can afford to take some risks. What would be the next film? Unclear. No other character has the solo appeal of Wolverine. A 'Wolverine 2' is rumored, though what more of the story can they tell? Wait and see, I suppose.",5,2,6,9 May 2009
That Thing You Do!," Catchy Tune Propels The Film
","A Pennsylvania band scores a hit in 1964 and rides the star-making machinery as long as it can, with lots of help from its manager (Tom Hanks).There is nothing really new here. A cast of fresh-faced kids (and a young Liv Tyler), rising up in stardom, and stumbling along the way. We all know what happens if we let fame get to our heads and we leave our friends behind.What makes this film stand out is the catchy tune. Even though they play it a dozen times throughout the film, it never really gets old. Had the song been not as good, the film would drag and certainly would not having the staying power it does. (Not unlike 'Eddie and the Cruisers', which is very much anchored by its 'Dark Side' song.)",7,0,1,2 June 2015
Hot Fuzz," A Decent British Comedy, But Nothing Timeless
","After doing a good job and making other officers look bad, a detective is transferred to a sleepy village where everything is done for the greater good. Soon, he begins to clean up... but there's a killer on the loose! So this vacation gets a bit more exciting because this silt just got real.As I write this, this film is ranked the 148th greatest film of all time. I'm sorry, it's not that good. 'Shaun of the Dead' is a better film, I can name a dozen better comedies. This was good, but not that good. More often than not it just drags on and offers nothing original to the long list of movies it follows. I mean, it's primary gags rely on ripping off 'Bad Boys II' and 'Point Break' (see my review of this elsewhere). How is that clever? The beginning is funny, but stops after maybe ten minutes. One character is interesting -- the supposed killer (played by Timothy Dalton) who 'slashes prices' and has deals that are 'criminal'. I think without him and his theme music the entire movie would have been a failure.The basic plot is not unlike 'The Wicker Man'. The creators clearly acknowledge this by having the original actor from 'Wicker Man' appear (I believe his name is Edward Woodward). And I'll tell you, I enjoyed the original film much better (though I think 'Hot Fuzz' is better than the Nicolas Cage remake). This just doesn't have the timeless quality and weird musical undertones.If you liked 'Shaun of the Dead', you'll like this. Maybe you'll even like it better. Maybe you're like everyone else and think this is one of the greatest films ever. I don't get it, but if someone could clue me in I'd be happy to give the film a second chance. It runs too long, goes too slow and just doesn't hold my attention. At least it has some good murder scenes.",6,1,3,16 August 2007
The Mummy," A Surprisingly Decent Reboot / Remake
","An American (Brendan Fraser) serving in the French Foreign Legion on an archaeological dig at the ancient city of Hamunaptra accidentally awakens a mummy.To call this a remake of the 1932 film is a bit of a stretch. Some bare bones elements are the same, but where the original was a horror film, this is really an action-adventure film with some horror elements thrown in. What is most fascinating is the long list of hands it went through: Wes Craven, Joe Dante, Clive Barker, George Romero, Mick Garris... one can only imagine how different people would have tackled the film.What we end up with is really more of an Indiana Jones vs. the Undead sort of story. And while it may not be the most intellectual film, and some of the CGI is clearly rushed, it is a fun flick. It should come as no surprise that they've made three sequels (and already planning a 2017 reboot).",7,0,1,29 July 2016
Constantine," A Great Story, But Told With No Soul
","John Constantine has survived hell, and now fights to keep demons away from Earth, despite being banned from Heaven (basically fighting for God and humanity with no chance of being rewarded for it).I never read the Hellblazer comics, but I am under the impression they are probably very interesting. The elements of this film are very interesting -- the philosophical ramifications are intriguing and the story in general is unlike any other heaven versus hell story you'll come across. Constantine is a unique character, and one we might call the tragic hero.The film, however, left me feeling very empty. The concepts were interesting, and I really enjoyed the presence of the Spear of Destiny (one of the more interesting parts of the Adolf Hitler mythos). And even the special effects -- which I usually hate, as I hate all computer graphics -- were fairly impressive. I enjoyed the look of hell as a place being constantly bombarded by nuclear bombs. But something was not here, it was just very flat.First, much of the action really had little background. As the film progresses, you learn more about Constantine and the battles he fights. But so much of the story is not explained. I understand in the director's commentary he points out what certain items are and where people's motivations are coming from. But this does not do me any good, does it? And my biggest complaint was the overall feel. While the graphics were nice, the tone was supposed to be dark. A man fights demons, he's dying of cancer and there are suicides. Yet, the tone is more PG-13 and not so much R. The director did not darken the film at all, but kept it bright and vibrant (like a traditional comic book). Was he fighting the hordes of Satan or Casper the Friendly Ghost? There was simply no suspense or character emotion at all.The playing up of the Roman Catholic point of view was overdone. The female lead says something like, 'My sister was Catholic, there's no way she'd commit suicide.' Um, Catholics kill themselves all the time. And then over and over they repeated that Catholics believe suicide is a one-way ticket to hell. Why do they feel the need to explain this over and over but they don't explain the aspects that are actually difficult? And also, the thing about getting buried in a Catholic cemetery because of suicide: this didn't need as much emphasis, and is also false. Sure, the rules say you can't, but it still happens all the time. Why do the writers assume everything is so cut and dry? This movie was directed by Francis Lawrence, whose past efforts have only been music videos. Granted, some great directors can come from music videos or commercials or even from nowhere at all. But Lawrence might not be one of them if he can't tell what a light film is and what a dark film is. And his next project? Richard Matheson's 'I Am Legend' -- a remake of 'Omega Man' and 'Last Man on Earth'. Now, this film is already destined to be mediocre (Will Smith does not have the science fiction integrity of Vincent Price or Charleton Heston), but if Lawrence goes and makes this another 'light' film, the entire project is a waste of time.Keanu Reeves is decent in this regardless of what others say. This is probably the most mature thing I've seen him in. The original actor was Nicolas Cage, who probably would have been even better, but Reeves did a fine job. (I have heard this film gets compared to 'The Matrix' a lot. I didn't make that connection, but if it's true it could have avoided such things without Reeves, obviously.) Rachel Weisz is a strong actress, even when given horrible roles like this one. I feel bad having to say anything against her, so I just won't. I only wish she would have walked out on this film and done something else.Most surprising was probably Gavin Rossdale, who played the half-breed demon Balthazar. I thought he was very calm, cool and collected and quite sinister. Often I find musicians do not cross over to acting with as much success as they had planned, but Rossdale really had great screen presence. I hope people continue to call on him for such projects, especially roles that Jude Law is not available for.I know that I'm probably in the minority, but I don't want you to see this movie. My very good friend loves this movie ('one of the best') and his girlfriend likes it as well (and their tastes are not overly similar). And the general ratings seem to suggest others consider it to be decent. Well, I don't. It bored me and I thought it was really nothing special. I would have rather watched 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure'.",5,0,6,9 December 2006
The Natural," Supposedly Great Baseball Film Is a One-Trick Pony
","Robert Redford plays Roy Hobbs, a natural baseball all-star who is tragically (and unexpectedly) gunned down before reaching the majors. Sixteen years later, Hobbs returns from obscurity to try his hand at baseball again. Also starring Bob Duvall, Wilford Brimley, Glenn Close and Kim Basinger. With very special guest Michael Madsen.Overall, the movie was watchable and fun, especially if you like baseball. But other than the twist in the first fifteen minutes, the film has nothing to offer you won't find in every other baseball movie. Just a different cast (with all due respect to Redford).The emotional angle was weak, with the part of Memo being overplayed and unbelievable (and hard to interpret). Meanwhile, the connection with Glenn Close is never made clear until too late, at which point the idea is wasted.The real star of this movie is Bob Duvall, who follows Redford around and writes newspaper stories on him. For some odd reason, he can't recall meeting Hobbs those 16 years ago, but this doesn't stop him from digging up a good story.Michael Madsen makes an appearance and I want to believe this is one of his first roles. His acting is awful, and you can tell that between lines he is trying too hard to get into character. Whereas in 'Reservoir Dogs' he looked natural and calm, here he looks like he'd be more comfortable in a high school musical.This movie is alright, but steadily declines after the first half. You can go ahead and watch it, but don't call me over to join you.",6,4,11,3 October 2006
The Others," A Really Good Film, But I Think It Loses Something Along the Way
","A woman and her two children live in a large house, waiting for the father to return. A maid, a gardener and a nanny arrive to help take care of the large house. But some others arrive, too -- a group that believe the house if rightfully theirs. This house is haunted! Nicole Kidman stars. Tom Cruise produces. It's tough to say how much of this film is due to their involvement and how much is due to just being a good movie. Certainly the success and nominations came from Kidman appearing (any other actress and this film would have faded into quick obscurity). But it's still artsy and I like that about the movie.I really can't talk about this film because there's twists and I want to mention them to really give a good overview. I knew about the twists when I sat down to watch this, which I think took something out of the film for me. Which leads me to think this film would not be half as good on a second or third viewing. My colleague in the movie review business, The Butcher, listed this as a must-see horror film. And it ranks at the bottom of the Internet Movie Database's Top 50 horror films, which is still respectable. I guess I don't think it's as good as they make it out to be.The 'horror' elements are pretty much just thumps, bumps and people who might be ghosts that we don't really ever see (they always leave the room before the camera enters). So, it's not a scary film. The house and costumes are beautiful, for what that's worth... but not scary.Go ahead and watch this one. I think it's more a drama than horror, but that's not a reason not to watch it, I suppose. Strong acting everywhere, and the kids are fun if for no other reason than they have interesting accents. I suspect they'll never get another acting job again (especially the boy). Not one of my favorites, but good nonetheless.",7,0,3,1 July 2007
Dead Poets Society," A Story of Inspiration
","English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) inspires his students to discover their love for poetry and seize the day.This is a story about what one teacher (or a mentor of any kind) can do to inspire the youth, whether it be for good or evil. Those viewing this film will generally see it as a force for good, a call to 'seize the day'. And that is probably the correct interpretation.But interestingly, the call for non-conformity leads to its own kind of conformity. And one could argue that Keating's power is not much different than that of a politician or cult leader. Had he chosen to use it differently, he could have been a very dangerous force in these young men's lives. In fact, we see not everyone who followed his path was better because of it.",7,3,4,11 April 2015
Brokeback Mountain," One Love Story to Rule Them All
","As Senator Russ Feingold said, this film is tremendous and tragic. I heard all the hype for months and wasn't really expecting much (I'm not much for hype), but now that I've seen it, I'm converted. This might be the greatest love story ever told (or at least ranks very high, with 'The Princess Bride', 'A Walk to Remember' and others).The story is fairly simple: two ranchers meet while working at the same ranch and develop a strong attraction for each other. At the end of the job, they go their own ways and go on to have wives and kids. But the feelings won't stop, and they will travel great distances to be together.Roger Ebert hit the nail on the head about the secret of this film's greatness: our own forbidden love. We can identify with being in love with someone society doesn't want us to be. Different gender, religion, age (this also makes 'Lolita' great), race... the list goes on. We haven't all had a forbidden love, but I believe most of us have a deep sense of the power of love and we think that love is the one thing worth overcoming obstacles for. Or maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic.Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger were both great in this. Ledger really shows his acting limits here, becoming a whole new person. But the real gems are Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams. Hathaway, known from 'Princess Diaries' and 'Ella Enchanted' (both of which I've seen for some reason) takes a surprisingly adult turn here. Not unlike how Jennifer Connelly went from 'Labrynth' to 'Requiem for a Dream'. Michelle Williams also makes a more adult turn. I never cared for her from 'Dawson's Creek', but I think her character is the most powerful in this story. Her role as both obstacle and victim is very intense.You really should see this movie. All men, women and children should see this movie. The only excuse you have not to see it is if you're a raging homophobe, but if you are you're probably not capable of fully understanding love anyway. Highest possible human recommendation.",10,23,27,13 March 2006
Ed Wood," Angora Sweaters Rule
","As of this writing, this movie is ranked the 192nd greatest movie of all time on the Internet Movie Database. The important thing is that out of millions of movies, this one is considered in the top one percent. And I tend to agree that it is much better than the average film, and probably better than the average Tim Burton film.What we have is a biopic of Ed Wood, the B-movie director. And like the man himself, it sure is odd! The closest thing to this film I've ever seen is 'Shadow of the Vampire', but as this film came first I think I have a hunch where they got their inspiration.Johnny Depp shines in this film, one of his better films and probably his best with Tim Burton. Jeffrey Jones is well-cast. Sarah Jessica Parker, whom I usually despise, is even pleasant... better than her 'Mars Attacks!' role. That Vinnie guy from Doogie Howser is alright. But the two best roles? Martin Landau and Bill Murray.Bill Murray is very hit and miss with me. Some films, like Ghostbusters and Rushmore, he shines. Other times he is just too bland. But this movie? Perfect. Who knew that the best actor to play a flamboyant grandson of a former vice president was Bill Murray? I really enjoyed the sexual tension between Murray and the mariachi band.Martin Landau is Bela Lugosi, best known for his role of Dracula. But although we already knew the horror movie actor, did we know the alcoholic Lugosi? The potty-mouthed Lugosi? The Lugosi who danced with cross-dressers and wished death upon Boris Karloff? Landau makes us believe this man was real, and even Lugosi's son says the portrayal is accurate. So, that's good enough for me.I didn't even mention Vincent D'Onorfrio as Orson Welles... This film is highly recommended!",8,1,2,3 March 2006
Chicken Run," Nick Park and His Chicken Story
","Chicken Run is a comedy escape drama with a touch of passion set on a sinister Yorkshire chicken farm in 1950s England.Taking a page from 'Braveheart', Nick Park weaves a tale of chickens who long to be free. There is even mention of 'free range', though this term might be an anachronism. Either way, it is the similar style we have come to expect from the man, now with chickens. For many people, this might be awesome. Personally, I am not a huge fan of the style.More interestingly, is how the film changed the Academy Awards. Allegedly, there was push to get this film a Best Picture nomination (which seems unlikely), and that push failed. But the Academy recognized the growing number of animated films and opened the door for them to have their own category. This has completely changed the way we look at animation each year.",7,0,1,25 February 2015
Orphan," Top Notch Horror Film
","A husband and wife who recently lost their baby adopt a 9-year-old girl who is not nearly as innocent as she claims to be.Aside from some very, very minor complaints on the script, this film is practically flawless -- constantly suspenseful, creepy and well-acted throughout. The kids (especially the girls) were incredible, and should both have bright futures ahead of them if they stay in the business.As I said, the film is suspenseful ,and it is this tense nature that delivers. While there are some releases, the tension more or less builds throughout... and as the mother/wife becomes more and more alienated, we feel her frustration. The film is strong because while it has some traditional horror elements (bloody murder), it also has a very strong mental undercurrent.Roger Ebert says, 'You want a good horror film about a child from hell, you got one.' And that is exactly right. I went into this film expecting some sort of 'Omen' ripoff. Not at all. Besides the fact they both have evil children, there is no similarity. Maybe closer to 'The Good Son'. But of the three, this one is hands-down the creepiest and best picture.",Null,1,2,25 October 2011
Home Alone," A Hughes-Columbus Christmas Classic
","After being accidentally left home alone by his family, Kevin McAllister (Macaulay Culkin) must defend his residence from the Wet Bandits (Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci), who are for some reason obsessed with the idea of hurting the little boy and stealing useless knick-knacks.This film is a legend and a classic. Released in 1990, it captures both the more serious 1990s with the fun 1980s. Two 1980s masters come together to film this one: John Hughes as writer ('Sixteen Candles', 'Pretty in Pink', 'The Breakfast Club') and Chris Columbus as director ('Adventures in Babysitting'). This makes for the perfect blend in young adult situation comedy.This is the film that launched Macaulay Culkin's career. While he had previously appeared in 'Jacob's Ladder' and 'Uncle Buck', this was (and remains) his biggest and most cherished role. I would find it safe to say no film since has really captured the essence of Macaulay. While 'Saved' and 'Party Monster' are both (possibly) equally as good movies, they do not have the mass appeal of 'Home Alone'.What is best about the film is its sense of fun. The plot really makes little sense. How does a family not notice they have an extra plane ticket or that a sibling is missing? Why would burglars break into a house where they can be identified? How can Joe Pesci get beat up relentlessly and not curse once? Is it possible to not have a single friend, family member or neighbor in all of Chicago? The 'Scream' joke was used too much (four times). At least one, and probably two, instances could have been removed. Do we need to see a little boy twice getting burned by aftershave? Of course not. The repeated use of the 'keep the change you filthy animal' joke seemed to work very well, though, strangely enough.Overall, this is a great Christmas movie. Along with 'Die Hard' this is one you really need to make sure you watch around the holidays, at least once. If you have never seen 'Home Alone' you are one of five people on earth or something... it was a huge success. With good reason. So see it.",7,0,0,25 December 2006
The Hustler," A Fine Film, Made Finer By Paul Newman
","Small-time pool hustler 'Fast Eddie' Felson (Paul Newman) travels cross-country with his partner Charlie (Myron McCormick) to challenge the legendary player 'Minnesota Fats' (Jackie Gleason). Arriving at Ames, Fats's home pool hall, Eddie declares he will win $10,000 that night. Fats arrives and he and Eddie agree to play for $200 a game. After initially falling behind, Eddie surges back to being $1,000 ahead, and suggests raising the bet to $1,000 a game; Fats agrees.This film is great for the trick shots alone, but then you throw in Paul Newman, one of the greatest actors of all time. Oh, and Jackie Gleason at his best? And even George C. Scott? You really cannot make a bad movie under those conditions.There is some talk that this film captures man at his most human, a striving to be the best in his field, a competitive nature. And, along the way, he must stumble... but this seems a bit of a cop-out. As I understand it, most films feature characters who strive for a goal and encounter an obstacle along the way. That's nothing new, and never has been. Sure, as Ebert says, 'This is one of the few American movies in which the hero wins by surrendering, by accepting reality instead of his dreams.' But I don't find that as deep as he does.",8,0,0,25 March 2010
Spotlight," An Important Film
","The true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core. Going into awards season, 'Spotlight' was the early front-runner. And after the nominees were announced, it has remained a favorite. More than a handful of award nominations surround it, and we should expect it will get at least one, if not a few.Will it get an award for best screenplay? Certainly it has the chops to do so, as it has made journalism interesting again, the first film to do since since 'All the President's Men'. And it addresses the Boston clergy scandal in a fair way. This is not a smear campaign, but an honest look. Even the Church itself has accepted and praised the film. Vatican Radio, official radio service of the Holy See, called it 'honest' and 'compelling' and said it helped the Catholic Church 'to accept fully the sin, to admit it publicly, and to pay all the consequences.' Luca Pellegrini on the Vatican Radio website wrote that the Globe reporters 'made themselves examples of their most pure vocation, that of finding the facts, verifying sources, and making themselvesâfor the good of the community and of a cityâpaladins of the need for justice.'There are two acting awards to look at. Michael Keaton was projected to be nominated, but was not. In his place, we have two supporting actors: mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams. For whatever reason, the actress roles year after year are generally not very strong, and this may allow McAdams to sneak by. She is not outstanding by any means, but better than her usual self. But Jennifer Jason Leigh seems to be the front-runner, and Rooney Mara is also someone to watch. This is not your year, Rachel.Mark Ruffalo has a better shot. He has gone all out, and this may be his finest performance yet. For a guy who appeared in such films as '13 Going on 30', he has really distinguished himself. The intensity here. There is one clear 'Oscar scene' where Ruffalo stands up to Keaton's character. His biggest hurtle, though, will probably be Mark Rylance ('Bridge of Spies'). They are two very different performances, but the Academy's tendency to give out 'lifetime achievement awards' makes me suspect it will tip in Rylance's favor.Tom McCarthy as best director? Clearly if a film can be best picture the director deserves a chance to be best director. The two are almost always linked. But McCarthy has a strike against him: the Adam Sandler film 'The Cobbler'. Are people ready to forget about that? Probably. But yet, it seems like Inarritu ('The Revenant') may be taking this one... for the second year in a row, if memory serves me.Now, of course, that leaves best picture. As noted, the hype is there, the push is there, if you were involved in an Oscar pool this would be the wise bet. For me, it is a fight between 'Spotlight' and 'The Martian'. But I probably stands alone on that, and the reason is because 'Spotlight' is the more important film.'The Martian' is a hopeful story, but 'Spotlight' focuses on the importance of journalism and standing up for what is right. The film is even more important today than when the scandal happened because of the Internet. And they hint at that in one scene where a priest tells his congregation that the Internet cannot make faith obsolete. The real message is that the Internet cannot make good journalism obsolete. Papers may be shutting down or merging, but good reporting will always have its place... and thank goodness we have the folks at Spotlight to do that sort of work for us.",8,5,9,25 January 2016
My Neighbor Totoro," I Just Don't Get It
","When two girls move to the country to be near their ailing mother, they have adventures with the wondrous forest spirits who live nearby.At this point, I think I have seen all the major anime films, from this one to 'Spirited Away' to 'Princess Mononoke'. And I just do not get the appeal. The stories are sort of interesting with that fantasy element that is unique to the Japanese. But the animation is pretty weak, and it seems even sillier once you add the dubbing. (Of course subtitles would fix this, but nothing can fix the silly animation.) Some day it will make sense to me maybe... then again, probably not. But I probably never have to see any anime again so long as I live, as I have now checked them all off the IMDb 250.",5,5,17,12 June 2015
500 Days of Summer," A Film I Love To Hate And Hate To Love
","An offbeat romantic comedy about a woman (Zooey 'Poopsy' Deschanel) who does not believe true love exists, and the young man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who falls for her.I am so conflicted about this film. The quirkiness of it appeals to me, and it is great that Summer recognizes that the greatest Beatles song ever recorded in 'Octopus Garden', which most people overlook. And Chloe Grace Moretz has a supporting role, which instantly boosts it.But then there is my love-hate relationship with Zooey Deschanel. I hate her popularity, and I hate her character here. But that is more about me than the film. So it is an internal conflict in watching this -- do I enjoy the good parts and ignore the bad parts, or just go ahead and hate the whole thing?",7,0,1,26 June 2015
Juno," An Adult Film For Teens, a Teen Film For Adults
","A teenage girl gets pregnant, and considers her options. After turning down abortion (in an odd scene with Emily Perkins ('Ginger Snaps')) her decides to give the child up for adoption. Hilarity ensues as we follow her misadventures as well as the relationship of her chosen adopted parents (played perfectly by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). This isn't Kirsten Dunst in '15 and Pregnant'.I didn't know how to approach this movie, as I didn't know who the audience was supposed to be. Kids? Adults? It turns out the people who will love this most are fans of 'Dawson's Creek' and 'Garden State' most likely, as this film seems to be a blend of those two. The unrealistic (but enjoyable dialog) of Dawson, and the independent spirit of Garden State. And, thankfully, no Zach Braff. Just lots of fun pop culture references spoken by a kid with a grad student's vocabulary. (I really enjoyed the line about Morgan Freeman and the 'Bone Collector' as well as the Thundercats reference, despite both being technically incorrect.) Surprisingly, it has little or no resemblance to 'Arrested Development' despite having two of the stars in the picture (though never on screen together).The music was a strong point of the film, with the focus being Kimya Dawson and the Moldy Peaches. I'm not a big Kimya Dawson fan (my experience with her comes through a friend I can no longer call a friend), but this film sold me. The friend I watched it with was still pondering the next day whether Kimya is a genius or, to tone tone her language, a bunch of rubbish. I was leaning more towards a free spirit doing what she wants, not genius or rubbish, and I think that fits the main character in Juno, who is one of the most unique girls you'll meet.The best subplot for me was the relationship between Juno and Mark (Jason Bateman), which teeters between father-daughter and near-lovers. I really love how they worked music discussions into the film (Sonic Youth?) and the horror conversation -- what other film talks about Dario Argento and features 'Wizard of Gore'? Not sure about anyone else, but it hit home for me. That's the difference between a good and great movie, the power to resonate.As stated, fans of 'Dawson' or 'Garden' ought to see this. I think most people will like it (my mother did) but this group will like it best. The lead actress (Ellen Page, Kitty Pryde from the 'X-Men' franchise) is going places (and I don't just mean starring in the new Sam Raimi horror flick).",8,2,6,10 February 2008
L.A. Confidential," I Wish This Film Had Been Five Hours Long
","What happens when a squad of corrupt cops in the 1950s explore a murder case from multiple angles and find their corruption coming back on them like chickens coming home to roost? Who will solve the crime? Who will survive and what will be left of them? This movie is phenomenal. The only reason I didn't give it 10 out of 10 is because I didn't care for the ending (which I won't reveal). It's a world were Hollywood and law enforcement cross over and even the hookers want to be movie stars. I have not read the Ellroy novels, but I have been told they are even more intricate than this film with a lot more backstory. I would watch a five or six hour version of this film. But even so, that is the strong point of this film: multiple stories that begin to overlap. Sure, others (Tarantino) have tried this, but I think this is the most expertly done conception I've seen yet.Kevin Spacey's part as a Hollywood obsessed cop is beautiful and he fits the part to a tee. His role is supposed to be similar to Dean Martin and I can see that; Spacey again harnessed this kind of character when he made 'Beyond the Sea'. Spacey's role is the connection between the world of law and the world of fame.Russell Crowe plays the 'bad cop' who crosses the line with sheer thuggery and an attraction to a prostitute (Kim Basinger, who does a fine job being both alluring yet tasteful). His part was supposed to be for Michael Madsen (one of the greatest actors of all time for a cop/crook movie), but I think Crowe may have been the better choice. Who else can be a natural thug?Guy Pearce... I was not sure how to take him. I have not enjoyed him ('Time Machine') and yet also loved him ('Memento'). In the beginning, I thought it would be another geeky Pearce role and I was a bit concerned. But as the film progresses, so does Pearce's character become more lovable and impressive. You'll agree.Danny DeVito was okay and James Cromwell was insidiously delightful.Brian Helgeland adapted this screenplay. You may know him best as the writer of 'A Knight's Tale' and 'The Order'. The Order was crappy. But A Knight's Tale is fantastic. This, by far, will go down as his crowning achievement. He may as well call up Michael Bay and go retire in the South Seas where they'll never be found.Simply put, this is the best film I've seen in at least a month (and I watch at least a movie a day). Maybe the best film I've seen all year. Don't set this movie aside, you need to put this on the top of your honeydew list.",9,1,2,18 September 2006
The Jungle Book," A Strong Disney Film
","Bagheera the Panther and Baloo the Bear (Phil Harris) have a difficult time trying to convince a boy to leave the jungle for human civilization.Although this movie appeared after the Golden Age and before the Second Golden Age, it was a pretty strong entry in the Disney catalog. Most people are familiar with the 'Bear Necessities' song, even if they do not know the words. And a whole new generation was introduced to the characters in the 1990s through the cartoon series 'Tailspin'.What is most interesting is how Ka is voiced by the same man who did Winnie the Pooh, and there is very little difference in how he presents them (beyond extending the hiss sound for Ka). If you close your eyes, you could hear Pooh make threatening comments... it is rather strange.",7,0,0,14 May 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A Very Impressive Third Film
","The third (and final?) Disney pirates film may be, in fact, the best. Defying the idea that sequels are often weaker, this one has plenty of plot, action and even romantic twists to keep the fans interested.Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) doesn't make an appearance until thirty-three minutes into the film. I think this is a great thing for the film -- while Depp may bring the crowds, having a film rely on him is largely a gimmick. Having to rely on the plot, or acting of Orlando Bloom is a much better way to go. If you can succeed on that, you have a great film -- and they do! I should also point out the soundtrack. All three films have a decent score which is very unique and also listenable outside of the movie (though maybe not appropriate for night driving if you want to stay awake).",7,0,2,23 July 2010
Don Jon," The Next Phase of Gordon-Levitt's Life
","A New Jersey guy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) dedicated to his family, friends, and church, develops unrealistic expectations from watching porn and works to find happiness and intimacy with his potential true love.Until now, I was never sold on Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I could only see him as the kid from '3rd Rock From the Sun'. Boy, does this change his image -- muscular, guido accent and look... and the overall focus on sex (not even sexuality, but just sex). And he directed this, too? I see a future for this cat.Further, how do you beat Tony Danza dropping the F-bomb? He is so natural, it is great to see him in this role. Where have you been, Tony? Lastly, bonus points for the Benny Benassi.",7,1,3,2 May 2014
Spider-Man 3," A Solid Film For a Comic Fan
","This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.",7,4,6,17 April 2011
Match Point," Could this be Woody Allen's Best Work?
","Chris is a former tennis pro who gives it up to teach at an exclusive club. The club owner's daughter falls for him and a romance blooms. Unfortunately, things are not that simple: his passion is for another woman, a struggling American actress.This is not your traditional Woody Allen film. The man himself does not appear, the humor is toned down to the point of being non-existent, and the verbose vocabulary Allen often employs is not to be found. We are also placed squarely in upper class London, not the usual stomping grounds of Manhattan. Indeed, there is little here to suggest an Allen film at all.The closest we come to any obvious intellectual subtext is early on we see a copy of the 'Cambridge Companion to Dostoevsky', something that comes into play later on, with Chris invoking the spirit of Raskolnikov. What is the significance of 'The Motorcycle Diaries'? Do the operas they take in tell a parallel story? If so, and I would not be surprised, this was clearly over my head.There is a dichotomy of 'luck' and 'faith', with the protagonist preferring the former and abandoning the latter. The concept of faith does not come up often, but luck sneaks in every now and then, and could be said to play a crucial role at a few points, twisting the plot is unforeseen directions. Indeed, if you watch the first hour and do not understand the high praise this film gets, keep watching. The sharp divergence in the second half will keep you glued to your seat -- this is tension at its very best.There is a second dichotomy of stability and passion. Clearly, being involved with the boss's daughter has a certain appeal. Wealth, connections and not a care in the world. But the sex is 'mechanical' with such non-arousing comments as, 'I want you to make me pregnant.' The foreigner is something exotic (literally), unpredictable, and enticing. Is love grounded in passion or something else? Who knows? But passion is a strong force on man.There could have been a social message about class. Chris is clearly from a lower class background in Ireland, and through hard work and diligence has worked his way up to the good graces of the upper class with their tennis, opera and exclusive clubs. Nola is also from the lower class, with a hard-drinking mother, but she hides it well. Yet these class distinctions never seem to come to a head -- the same story could have been told any time in any place. It is, above all, a parable of fidelity.Ironically, even though not a comedy, this ranks among Woody Allen's best work. The story is strong, unique and looks sharp. We can feel sympathetic with Chris while simultaneously despising him. And Scarlett Johannsen looks sexier here than any other film I can think of, which is a feat in itself. Solid script, directing, acting and more... this truly is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.",8,0,3,13 April 2011
Midnight in Paris," Who Knew Owen Wilson Could Act or Be Good?
","A family travel to the French capital for business. The party includes a young engaged couple who are forced to confront their differing views of a perfect life.First and foremost, Owen Wilson deserves some kind of applause for this. He can play goofy, cheesy roles, but is not really a strong character. Woody Allen found a way to make that work here, making the timid Wilson a strong lead.The film, of course, was nominated for best picture and won best screenplay. I think this is perfectly fair. Allen's strength is his writing. He is nothing more than an average director, but his scripts easily carry his films -- the intellectual dialogue is appealing without being pretentious. How he does that is beyond me.And seeing Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali... nice.",8,0,0,12 May 2012
Zodiac," The First Real True Crime Epic... Truly Awesome
","In 1969... a man started a crime spree that will forever haunt California and America. He called himself the Zodiac and taunted police officers and newspaper reporters. To this day (2007) he has never been caught and no one can prove his identity. This is the true story of one man's search for the Zodiac from the beginning until today.Unlike other serial killer stories, this one put the focus on the search rather than the killer. Yes, we have scenes with the Zodiac killing people. Yes, we have the police trying to catch Zodiac. And yes, we have the story of Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) who became a potential target of the Zodiac after insinuating he was a 'latent homosexual'. But the story is most closely tied to Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist who picks up where Avery and the police left off, putting the puzzle together as his life falls apart. And that is a real human story underneath the murders and sensationalism.Director David Fincher, best known for 'Seven' and 'Fight Club', is back in top form here. He gets the right combination of the period piece (several decades are covered) and a hint of the film noir that makes this gritty story all the more dirty and suspenseful. Coming in at just under three hours, he knows how to grab the audience and hold them. How this will fare under repeated viewings I'm not sure (some of the mystery will be gone) but on the first take everything comes out close to perfection.Robert Downey, Jr. is a great actor. If you haven't seen 'The Singing Detective', you should. But also, this film will give you a good sample of his ability to be both a loose cannon and a straight shooter. I actually wish he had been the lead, as I couldn't wait for each chance to see Downey perform. The lead, Jake Gyllenhaal, played a good Graysmith, but he seemed to me too young and fresh. Granted, the real story probably was very much like the way Gyllenhaal played it to be, but I found myself frustrated by having a hero who was so unsure of himself.Mark Ruffalo, like myself a Wisconsin native, was just as good as Downey. I freely admit I'm not familiar with his work, but here he was great as the animal cracker connoisseur and chief flatfoot. I cannot pinpoint for you what made him great, but I felt this character -- a man whose life was both consumed by the Zodiac while also trying in vain to run from the case.The supporting cast was wonderful. Elias Koteas (who you know best as Casey Jones from the 'Ninja Turtle' films) was a great cop, Clea Duvall was an inmate (and didn't get nearly the screen time she deserves). Adam Goldberg is a reporter (and probably the wrong person to be cast in the role, despite his fine job). Chloe Sevigny was Graysmith's wife, and she really stands out as a great character and actress. I've long admired Sevigny since I first saw her, and as she's aged her choices of roles show she is a determined and focused actress. They are not glamorous parts (she is more plain here than ever before) but really important and strained roles fit only for professionals.The music here is great for setting the period (Donovan's 'Hurley-Gurly Man' is the perfect choice for a theme) and it never seems to be sunny in San Francisco (this is that film noir feeling I mentioned). There is no aspect I can really say stands out as poor.My one concern, which is no fault of the film's, is how certain characters are strongly suggested to be the Zodiac. As these are real people, and there is no conclusive proof that they were or are the Zodiac, it seems in poor taste and disrespectful to the families to suggest such a thing. But I will not deny that some of the most tense and emotional scenes came when the police or Graysmith were face to face with people who might possibly have been a heartless killer.See this soon, because if you can it's one you'll want to see in the theater. Worth your time, worth your hard-earned funds, and an experience this epic should only be viewed with the best screen and the best sound. Most home systems simply will not do this one justice. As you can guess, I give this the highest possible recommendation.",8,3,12,18 March 2007
Milk," Very Compelling
","The story of Harvey Milk (Sean Penn), and his struggles as an American gay activist who fought for gay rights and became California's first openly gay elected official.This is a solid cast, with the best performance James Franco ever gave, and Emile Hirsch (with an even better performance than 'Into the Wild'). And the makeup department did a fine job making them look like their real world counterparts.While a bit more focus on Milk's Jewish roots might have been nice, this was not germane to the film and can probably be overlooked. In fact, this picture serves as a broad overview of gay rights history. How accurate it is may be debatable, but it will have those who are curious looking into more about the Castro, Milk, Anita Bryant and other things brought up here.",8,0,2,15 December 2014
The Prestige," Give This Film Time to Sink In...
","Leaving the theater, I thought the film was just okay. An hour later, I thought it was pretty clever. And now, the next day, I think it was amazing. Why the change? It took that long for most or all of the subtle hints to sink in and the real twists to be discovered. The film doesn't end when you leave, it begins.The story is the tale of two magicians in a bitter rivalry, always trying to do a better trick than the other and trying to sabotage the other's success. At least, that's what you think the story is until you finally see 'the prestige'.I can't discuss much of this film because giving almost anything at all away would ruin some of the fun. But a few notes: Christian Bale, as always is awesome. An incredible actor with a wide range and screen appeal. Christopher Nolan works well with him (see 'Batman Begins') and I hope they continue this Burton-Depp relationship they have. I foresee only greatness.Hugh Jackman is also spectacular, probably giving the most diverse performance in the film, easily the most demanding. And he does this convincingly.Scarlett Johannson is Scarlett Johannson... if you've liked her before, you should like her here (though her role never really gets the full story it needs). And David Bowie... wow, he is so much better than 'Labrynth' would have you believe.The visuals are stunning, but the real credit goes to the makeup department, who deserve an Oscar for this picture. Outside of horror films where extensive makeup is often required, this film probably does more to change the actors' appearances than any other film I've ever seen. And I was going along with the ride the whole time.If you see one film from 2006, see 'The Departed'. But if you see two, 'The Prestige' better be on your list.",10,4,7,28 October 2006
The Terminator," The Beginning of an Incredible Franchise
","In the year 2029, the robots have taken over but are losing the war... and they have devised a plan: send a robot back to the past to destroy the mother of the human leader, thus causing him never to be born. Unfortunately for the evil robots, human Kyle Reese has been sent back, too.While I think the sequel is flatly better, and I do not feel this film deserves to be in the top 250 of all time, it is a good film by all accounts. Action, good plot, decent acting... horror icons Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, and Dick Miller are all here. A young Bill Paxton even shows up.James Cameron has had an amazing career, and this was an early triumph. Even if he walked away from the franchise after the first film (a great science fiction tale), he would have kicked off an amazing series and a television show. With consistently strong writing, plot and continuity, we have to thank Cameron.",7,4,5,12 September 2010
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton and Horror is a (Super)Natural Combination
","Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent away from New York City to the small town of Sleepy Hollow, where he can use his unorthodox detective skills without bothering anybody... and maybe solve a murder along the way. What he stumbles on is not just any murder, but an ongoing killing spree of epic proportions.Anyone who is familiar with Tim Burton's work is going to wonder why he doesn't do more horror films. 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Nightmare Before Christmas', 'Sweeney Todd', and others have that dark vibe... even his Batman films were rather dark compared to other incarnations. How can this be his only true horror flick? It is done so well.And, of course, he wasn't alone... this is the product of skilled people across the board. It was written by Andrew Kevin Walker ('Brainscan', 'Seven', '8MM') and produced by Francis Ford Coppola, two horror veterans that are never bad to have around.The cast? Ricci, Depp, Walken, Lee, Jeff Jones... each one could get a paragraph of praise. I don't know that this is the best work of either Ricci or Depp, but even their less than best work is better and more entertaining than most others in the acting profession today. And together? A dream come true, if you're a Ricci fan -- Depp already knows how to interact with Burton, so that's a given.The film itself is great in the art department, lighting, cinematography... more or less in every way. It's a very polished, very artsy film. What you may not notice is the use of forced perspective, which I think they hid very well. Most of the outdoor shots were actually shot on set, so if you pay close attention you'll notice that you can never see too far back or too far in the sky... and camera angles were chosen to skew distances. It's a clever tactic and works.The film's audio commentary with Tim Burton is slightly disappointing, and not nearly as good as the film itself. He talks about the difficulty in finding cardinals, and jokes about Dutch masters, but doesn't offer as much insight as you may expect from a director. Many commentaries have a steady discussion going, but Burton seems comfortable to stay silent often and just watch his own film. If this film ever gets deluxe treatment, hopefully a second commentary is added because Burton -- as soothing as his voice is -- can't do it alone.",7,0,0,29 May 2009
Silent Hill," This Movie Makes Absolutely No Sense
","A woman brings her daughter to the ghost town of Silent Hill, and then loses her. The rest of the film involves the woman following clues to find her daughter while she is followed by a police officer and her husband. What she encounters is both shocking and unexpected.Director Christophe Gans loves the game 'Silent Hill' -- and so do a lot of people. But he really loves it, making sure he was the one to get the director's chair by really lobbying the people funding this project. His love shows in the movie ,where he kept many elements of the game, including exact replicas of maps and some of the original music.Roger Avary, a noted writer and Quentin Tarantino associate, wrote this film... his love of the game is not known to me. But what is known is that he was not capable of writing a coherent story. His first draft was rejected for having no male characters, so he added them in (which makes a world of difference to the story). But no one ever bothered to tell Roger that a plot has to make sense if you want people to watch and enjoy a movie.This movie is nonsense. Monster after monster is thrown at the lead character, with one having no known connection to the next. One beast has a sword five times larger than his body, making him just absurd. Things appear and disappear at random. Cops chase you and stalk your kids for no reason. You will find every clue left for you -- in order, in short time, in the most random places (a school desk, a corpse's mouth). Trying to tie this all together later on is great, but not when you've already lost half your audience by the time you get there.There is one good video game adaptation -- 'Resident Evil' (if there's another one, let me know). Part of what made it great is that the writer did not sit and say to himself, 'how much of the game can I push into this script?' Movies and games are a different world. The original Super Mario Bros movie is a great example of what happens when you try to put game aspects into a movie in the 'real world'.So, how can we make 'Silent Hill' better? First, editing. The movie is over two hours long, and there is no reason for this. Second, and most importantly, reduce the number of monsters. Yes, I like a good monster and even though the special effects and CGI were annoying I liked the spitter... but throwing in ten monsters where two or three will be fine is uncalled for, confusing and bogs down the viewer. If the viewer is me, my ability to believe what I'm watching will die faster than a goldfish in toilet.I will say the acting was good... except for the little girl. I saw her paraded around the talk shows when the movie came out and she seemed very intelligent and a nice kid. But I'm sorry, she was so fake in the film. Every line seemed so forced. Ugh! Although almost everyone I know likes this film, I have to say they're seeing something I'm not. I want this part of my life back. And while most films can get a second chance from me if they ask nicely, no matter how awful they are (like 'Lady in the Water'), this one never will. I really hope it goes out of print and stays that way.",4,3,8,20 December 2006
Hotel Rwanda," A Captivating Story of Genocide in Africa
","Hotel Rwanda tells the true story of one man's determination to hide over 1000 people during the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Watch as his country, his family and everything around him falls apart.This film was destined for greatness. The subject matter is so grave, so serious, that only a really bad film could have lessened the impact. And this is not a bad film, but rather a very good one: solid directing, great music, great acting and imagery.Don Cheadle is the main character. The only bad thing I can say is that he bears a striking resemblance to Tim Meadows, but that's not Cheadle's fault. Every tear, every cry of anguish and each loving embrace seemed real to me. And he definitely came across as someone who is African at heart. (I have no idea if Cheadle is African, American or European, but he could have been Rwandan.) I was confused by the appearance of Nick Nolte and Joaquin Phoenix. They could have been distracting from the overall film, as they were the only mainstream actors in this otherwise sea of unknowns. They weren't, though. Phoenix had a small role, yet quite powerful. And Nick Nolte was the shining star, playing a Canadian military man who was the only person who cared about the Rwandans. (His speech in the bar about the difference between Africans and n*****s rings very true, and sadly will for some time.) Jean Reno was Jean Reno, I could have used more of him, but I'm happy just knowing I was able to glance upon his droopy eyes and somber face.Now, the imagery is where this film shines the most: the violence, the corpses, the scenery... all so shockingly real. The film was rated R before petitioning for a PG-13. And I'm so glad they did, because the message inherent in this film should not be missed out because someone is 'too young' to understand. Hatred is universal.Watch this film, and if you have the heart, make the extra step: speak out against the genocides in Rwanda and other war-torn African nations.",8,0,0,30 August 2006
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Excellent Spy Thriller and Mystery
","In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6.Other reviewers have complained that the film is too 'obtuse', and in fact the movie was recommended to me because the person who watched it did not know what they had seen and wanted to know if I could figure it out any better. And yes, it takes a while to get the timeline and characters straight.But I think this is a strong movie for just that reason. While not the fun, feel-good movie of the year, it is an intelligent spy mystery. You might have to watch it two or three times to really figure out who is working for who. And you may as well -- the actors are incredible, the cinematography gorgeous. Heck, it might even take a second viewing to figure out what 'circus' and 'witchcraft' are.Ebert wrote that the film 'looks, sounds and feels exactly right.' That about sums it up.",8,2,4,21 April 2013
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino Adapts 'The Thing' Into a Western
","In the dead of a Wyoming winter, a bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) and his prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) find shelter in a cabin currently inhabited by a collection of nefarious characters. Part of the fun of watching a Quentin Tarantino film is trying to determine all the references he makes to other films. Whether you consider them homages or theft, he is known for an endless amount of small tips of the hat. In 'Hateful Eight', we get nods to 'Stagecoach', '3:10 to Yuma' and 'The White Hell of Pitz Palu', among many others.The most obvious reference (and the film that Tarantino acknowledges was his 'primary' inspiration) is John Carpenter's 'The Thing'. We have Kurt Russell, and we have an Ennio Morricone score (including some unused tracks taken directly from 'The Thing'). When you boil down the plot, you have even the same story: a group of people trapped in a blizzard, with at least one of them being not who they say they are, but something much more dangerous.In that respect, this is a fun movie and it is nice to see Tarantino convert Carpenter's work into a western. This is especially appropriate given Carpenter's love for Howard Hawks, and such westerns as Hawks' 'Rio Bravo' (which Carpenter remade as 'Assault on Precinct 13'). But it is not without its shortcomings.Tarantino has given in to his excesses. With his bigger budgets and A-list name, he is allowed to do more or less whatever he pleases. This has a bit of a backfire effect. The script is not as tight as it should be, with the dialogue going into the cheesy or campy terrain a bit more than it should. And when a movie runs to almost three hours in length, this time ought to be justified. For 'Hateful Eight', it is hard to justify it... there is no doubt a few minutes could have been trimmed here or there to keep the pace up.Counting this as his eighth film (which really depends on how you count, but we will go with Tarantino's own method), it is one that fans will enjoy, but ends up being on the lesser end of his work. I daresay this is his second-worst film, with only 'Jackie Brown' beneath it. In fairness, even a bad Tarantino movie is often better than the average film. But this is nowhere near the genius of 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Inglourious Basterds'.As far as the Academy Awards go, the nominations for 'Hateful Eight' ended up being spot on. Tarantino is typically praised for his writing, but as noted above, this is not a tight script, and it does not surprise me that it was passed over for a writing nomination. People may also be getting a bit fed up with how many times the n-word peppers the dialogue. While it does not offend me as much as it might others (I understand why it is used as it is), there does seem to be an over-saturation in this script, even more than 'Django'.The Best Cinematography nomination for Robert Richardson is well-deserved. Very few films have ever been shot in 65 or 70mm, and the lengths the studio had to go through just for theaters to screen such a film deserve recognition. But the award may not be given to Richardson just the same. Why? Because of two things. One, not everyone is able to see the film in this way. Voters are probably watching the movie at home on inadequate screens. Also, the widescreen is best suited for the Colorado landscape, but the vast majority of the film is indoors. This makes the idea something of a waste, or maybe a gimmick. The Best Original Score nomination for Ennio Morricone seems more likely. He was already given an honorary award, but could use a 'real' Oscar to put on his shelf. Morricone is, without a doubt, one of the all-time greatest composers. And his work here is just as good as anything he has ever done. Is it as iconic as 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'? No way. But how many scores are? He would have my vote.Which leaves Best Supporting Actress, and the nomination of Jennifer Jason Leigh. Of all the categories for 2015, this may be the most challenging. Leigh is the presumptive front-runner, but I think Alicia Vikander was outstanding in 'Danish Girl' and Rooney Mara has plenty of support for 'Carol'. Any of them could and should be honored. Although my instinct was to award Vikander, I am now leaning towards Leigh. Not only is she incredible in this role (remaining in the background of almost every scene), but it is high time she is awarded for past achievements. (Sure, that is not how the Oscars are supposed to work, but it is no secret that many awards are seen as 'career awards'... and Leigh has been an unsung heroine for decades in such great roles as in 'The Machinist' and 'Existenz'.)",7,3,9,14 February 2016
Gettysburg," Some Epic Beards
","In 1863, the Northern and Southern forces fight at Gettysburg in the decisive battle of the American Civil War.While this is truly a great film and one that probably got many people interested in history and the Civil War, it is also sort of strange in its forced portrayal of the events. Despite a massive budget, some of the beards look ridiculously fake. And the dialogue is often very unnatural, thrown in to make a point. The speech where it is shown that many Confederate soldiers were the grandchildren of Revolutionary War patriots is very interesting, but it is extremely unlikely that any such conversation happened. Why would a general even know who a soldier's great-uncle was? Anyway, if you can ignore the beards and the overly-clean uniforms, this is a pretty spectacular movie that goes out of its way to get an emotional response from people.",6,1,3,12 July 2017
Catch-22," Under-Rated, Forgotten Film Worth a Few More Viewings
","I don't know how to describe this movie: a dark comedy, an action film? A drama? Some parts are so serious and dark while other segments are mindbendingly hilarious.The main character, Yossarian, is trying to get out of flight duty because his superior keeps raising the number of missions. One by one his men are getting killed or going crazy (or both). There are suicides, friendly fire attacks with propeller blades, a sexual assault and a man who practices crashing his plane in the ocean. So Yossarian tries to escape and discovers the catch (Catch-22): A man can only be taken off flight duty if he's crazy. But if he reports himself crazy, he must be sane enough to know flying is a bad idea and is therefore deemed sane and forced to fly. Hence, there is no way out.The cast is phenomenal: Bob Newhart, Orson Welles, Anthony Perkins, Martin Sheen, Art Garfunkel, and Jon Voight. As well as others, of course. Voight particularly shines in this film as a capitalist who overtakes his unit and tries to cash in on the war to the point of being a dictator. He not only sells his men's parachutes but even makes a deal with the Nazis where he will bomb his own base.The sound and music is minimal. But this pays off for the movie because the few instances of music are more prominent. The directing is good, although I'm confused by much of the colorization.The most confusing part is trying to figure out why the same scene is replayed over and over again (each time revealing a few more moments). In the end, I think this makes more sense. At least it did for me.Check this film out. Where else can you find accepting a medal buck naked from Orson Welles? You certainly won't find that in 'The Stranger' or 'Citizen Kane'...",8,4,7,6 July 2006
We Were Soldiers," A New Perspective on Vietnam
","Short review: I typically do not care for Vietnam War movies. Some, like Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' are good. 'Platoon' is alright, 'Casualties of War' is okay... 'Hamburger Hill' is blah, 'Good morning Vietnam' too happy. The running theme is either firefights (which is good eye candy but poor storytelling) or the futility of war.'We Were Soldiers' has a different take. First, Mel Gibson plays a colonel with a degree, allowing him to not only think like a soldier but an academic. He understands military history and why strategies have or have not worked, and why Vietnam is as pointless as Korea was.But what really stood out was the focus on the wives. The story is almost always about the boys becoming men in the battlefield. We rarely, if ever, see their parents or spouses. Here is an exception... the wives are their own squadron, bonding together and keeping strong. And that's the reality of war: people don't just die -- someone else has to feel that loss.",7,3,5,2 October 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," As Far As Westerns Go, This One Probably Tops Them All
","Two outlaws rob banks and trains until the heat becomes a little too hot, and they flee to Bolivia where the bank robbing starts all over again.When you're dealing with the team of Paul Newman and Robert Redford, you can pretty much guarantee yourself a quality film. As of this review, the movie was sitting as the #135th of all time. I rated it a little lower than many people, but I don't deny the film's power. Redford and Newman are the Damon and Affleck of their generation.If nothing else, the movie is great because it is now iconic and to really understand many modern films you have to appreciate what this one was. How many movies and shows have duplicated the bike riding scene with Burt Bacharach's 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Dead'? Or Sundance's gun-play? And my all-time favorite movie, 'Mallrats', does a fine job of adapting the character of LaFours.) The script was written by William Goldman, probably best known for 'The Princess Bride', but also 'Maverick'. I have no doubt the light humor owes a debt to Goldman.The robberies and such were great, the horse-riding was well-done and very believable. I especially enjoyed the dynamite and the character of Woodcock. And the director's use of angle shots to make the mountains look even more impassable? Superb.Katharine Ross is gorgeous and a strong character who holds her own with the wily bandits. She could have had a larger part (except then they might have to rename the movie).Fantastic, epic and inspiration for both film-makers and bank robbers. Long live the legend of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.",8,0,1,9 October 2006
Crash," Good Film, But Rather Blunt
","Los Angeles citizens with vastly separate lives collide in interweaving stories of race, loss and redemption.When this film came out, it was a huge success, both critically and with the general viewer. Looking back a decade later (in 2014), the reason for this is somewhat obscure. Although the film looks great, is well-directed, and has a cast with more than a dozen big names, it is hampered by some rather shoddy writing.Not five minutes go by without someone making a racist comment. Now, of course, this is the point: to show us how racism is going strong in the 21st century, and it is not just black versus white. But the way it is shown here is just so blunt that it takes away any sort of artistic merit and just makes the film a moralizing, proselytizing screed. A very good one, but still just so solidly plain.",7,0,2,15 December 2014
Snatch," A Win for Everyone
","Snatch is a gangster tale, set in England. While it's nothing like these films, the best comparisons I can make are 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Way of the Gun'. All the actors do a spectacular job, especially Brad Pitt who plays Mickey the Piker. His ability to play a marble-mouthed boxer is impressive, comparable to any of his other solid roles. The camera work is brilliant, with guns directing the direction of angles. Boris the Blade is one of the greatest mob characters ever invented. But best of all is the intricacy of the script. Rather than a straight 'rise to the top' gangster movie like Scarface, this one requires multiple viewings to really understand. Multiple gangsters with various affiliations going after different objectives. Yet they're all interconnected, and trying to keep straight in your mind who works for whom might just take a little work. This film is highly recommended, and even more so if you're already a fan of the other films mentioned.",9,0,1,19 November 2005
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick's War Satire
","An insane general (Sterling Hayden) triggers a path to nuclear holocaust that a war room full of politicians and generals frantically try to stop.What is better than Peter Sellers playing three completely different characters (far better than Eddie Murphy could) and George C. Scott over-acting against his will? Not much.Say what you will about Stanley Kubrick, but he was not afraid to take risks and go in different directions. He was not a science fiction director (despite '2001' and 'Clockwork Orange'), a war director (despite 'Paths of Glory') or a noir director (despite 'The Killing'). He did it all.Here he takes on politics and the Cold War, and gives some great satire at a situation so dire you can do nothing but laugh at it. Is this an exaggeration of reality? Of course. But still recognizable enough that we know such a thing is not entirely impossible -- making it such a great satire, even today in a post-Soviet world.",8,1,4,18 November 2014
The Beach," Didn't Know What to Expect; It Wasn't This... And That's Okay
","For some reason I thought 'The Beach' was about nuclear disasters or something... not sure why. In reality, the film is about an island where a group of people live away from the world (to an extent, though they hypocritically rely on civilization for supplies)... for some unknown reason undiscovered by mainlanders or airplanes, though they are only a few miles from other people.While the film had some flaws, overall it was really good, I guess. Leonardo DiCaprio is a decent actor, under-rated by many people, I think. His 'survival mode' where he learns to become one with nature was really cool and reminded me of 'First Blood', only with a better-looking actor.The infamous video game sequence was not exactly what I expected, and was actually far more cheesy than I assumed. But funny, really funny. Whoever had the idea to put this in the film really had a stroke of genius that day.The makeup and special effects department deserved an Oscar for their work. I have seen plenty of horror films and love 'Jaws'... but the shark attack wounds in this film were so believable I could hardly breathe. Amazing work.All the scenes with Daffy were great. Somewhat gritty and very morbid, I was sucked into this film after the first gruesome scene with him. Excellent visuals. And when we return to this scene a few more times later, it is absolutely excellent. Unlike 'Catch-22', these returns to the same scene really drive the point home of Leo's state of mind.The beach scenes were also excellent as far as getting across the point of this being a place that was pure, clean and untouched by man. White sands, clear water... don't know if this was special effects or just a great location, but well played.My only two complaints are concerning the sex scene and the over-acting. I was rather confused by the scene between Richard and Sal... if he has a girlfriend, why is he sleeping with the nastiest woman on the island? I just don't get it. That was a poor idea and I found it hard to believe Richard was that stupid... but maybe he was.Also, the over-acting was atrocious. When they first encounter the beach, everyone gets super-pumped. Um, okay... it's a beach. Yeah, it's a really nice beach, but they've been living on islands covered in beaches. It's not a miracle. And when Richard tells of his shark adventure. everyone thinks it's the greatest thing since rye bread and he even tells it in an epic manner. Yeah, alright, it was pretty exciting, but not that exciting. These people need to lay off the crack pipe.But I liked the movie, and if you like Leo you should like this movie. It's a metaphor for teenagers, I think... how they believe they're independent, but really they're not and in reality they're helpless and stupid.",6,4,7,16 July 2006
MASH," A Truly Funny Film, Better Than the Show
","The staff of a Korean War field hospital use humor and hi-jinks to keep their sanity in the face of the horror of war.The film opens with the theme 'Suicide is Painless', which sets something of a somber tone. This, of course, is not the nature of the film. There is talk of suicide later on, but it never gets dark at all.The film features a young Donald Sutherland as 'Hawkeye' Pierce, young Rene Auberjonois as a minister, and a young Robert Duvall who already looks old. Burt Reynolds turned down the role of Trapper John.I dare say I prefer the cast of this film to the cast of the television show. I know people love that show, but I never really cared for it. This film, on the other hand, comes across much better to me.I say hooray for the Pabst Blue Ribbon and J&B product placement, and as the Last Supper reenactment with Hawkeye as Jesus. And then the reprise of 'Suicide is Painless' (with a jovial singer)...I liked the conversation about latent homosexuality, and how awkwardly it is presented. There is mention of what if you 'found out' you were gay after years of being married. I find that interesting -- not that one knows it and eventually admits it, but has to 'find out'. Yet, I think that may be the case. Being so convinced in the 1950s that homosexuality was a sin and a choice, it may take a good deal of realization before the gayness is clear.",7,0,2,26 April 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," A Historical Fantasy-Drama With Dark Wonderland Elements
","Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a young girl in 1940s fascist Spain, lives two lives: one in the real world, where her father is dead and her stepfather is an evil army captain, and another where she is a princess in a fairy tale. Worlds collide as she tries to escape one for the other and finds cruelty behind every corner.I want to go on record as saying as far as 'horror' films go, this one is not really horror at all and I would classify it as 'fantasy-drama'. But as far as movies in general go, this one was probably the best film of 2006, even beating out Darren Aronofsky's excellent 'The Fountain'. All aspects of a film that can be analyzed were present in top form here.The acting was simply amazing. The captain was evil incarnate, yet believably human -- these sorts of men did exist and still do. Putting a human face on a devilish beast is no easy task, but it was done in spades here. The main character, Ofelia, was likewise amazing: for being only 11, she out-acted many of the adults in this feature and gave off a look of natural innocence combined with childlike confidence. I cannot recall the last time such a young actor really made that sort of impression on me.The directing was quite well done with some breathtaking cinematography. In one memorable scene, the captain is looking at a derailed train and the angle shows him against a sky of blue-grey. I felt this really captured the whole mood of the film -- a skyline that said 'there is no hope here', a permanent twilight. Glorious! The special effects blew my mind. I detest CGI, but here it seemed to almost blend in with the real world in a seamless way. The insects, faeries, and everything else were just great, and the actress was able to interact with them in such a way as to think she was really looking at them. Just incredible -- I hope more films pay attention to how they accomplished this, because if CGI is not going to to go away, the least they can do is make it look good. (Compare Doug Jones from here -- the faun -- to Doug Jones from 'Hellboy' -- Abe Sapien -- and you will see what I mean about good and bad CGI.) For the horror fans: you will love how they did the special effects and makeup for the blood and violence. There is a man who gets his nose bashed in with a rifle butt, and another man who get his mouth slit to his ear. Both, in my opinion, look very realistic. Similar things might appear in horror films, but not often on this level of quality.Do I need to get into the plot? The fantasy part is great, like 'Silent Hill' but actually with a sense of continuity to it. ('Silent Hill' is awful.) The real-world part was also well-done, as we have seen many WWII films, but how many take place in Spain? Not nearly enough. The comparison this film gets most -- and del Toro admits an influence -- is 'The Spirit of the Beehive'. The connection is definitely there, but 'Pan's Labyrinth' is its own vision and may have even exceeded its predecessor.Please see this movie. I held off for many months, thinking it could not possibly match the hype. But it does match the hype, and really should be seen. Why are you wasting your time with crud like 'Lady in the Water' when the best film of 2006 (fantasy or otherwise) is right here?",10,2,7,7 July 2007
Knocked Up," A Drama Disguised as a Comedy
","Ben Stone goes out partying one night and ends up sleeping with a woman who has had a bit too much to drink. After getting 'knocked up' she decides to keep the baby, even though she's a successful working woman and Stone is a drug-using, unemployed slacker. Can they come to terms before the baby is born? I went into this film being told it's the funniest film of 2007. And I ended up seeing a drama or romance with some funny scenes thrown in, but hardly the funniest film of the year. (Those who promoted it have reneged on their claim after giving it a second viewing.) So, I was mislead... but it was still a good film.I just wanted to say that -- if you came for a comedy, you might be disappointed. The scenes with Paul Rudd are pretty funny, and the running gag of making beard jokes kept me laughing, but more often than not it is two people trying to make a hopeless situation workable. And that was confusing for me -- was this a comedy or a drama? Like 'Click', the comedy seemed overshadowed by the seriousness, but the seriousness was weakened by the comedy. maybe it was just me.I still think this is a good film and worth seeing. Especially if you enjoyed '40-Year Old Virgin'. We have Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, Paul Rudd and a little bit of Steve Carrell, so it's the usual suspects here. I think I found '40 Year' more satisfying as a whole, but the beard parts of this one were funnier than anything in the previous film. So, they each have redeemable qualities. If you didn't like '40 Year' then you're likely to be disappointed by this steady stream of cuss words and drug talk.",7,1,5,7 October 2007
Megamind," A Fun Surprise
","The supervillain Megamind finally defeats his nemesis, the superhero Metro Man. But without a hero, he loses all purpose and must find new meaning to his life.Of the animated films in the last ten years, 'Megamind' does not seem to get a lot of love. Which is a real shame. Because although it may be basically a Superman spoof, it is a very clever and very funny spoof. And with Will Ferrell and Tina Fey, it's hard to beat. (Jonah Hill could have been replaced.) Is it too late for a sequel? Because there really ought to be one, even if it seems that 'Despicable Me' has the animated villain market covered.",7,0,0,7 May 2017
Alien," A Classic in Both Horror and Sci-Fi Genres
","After landing on a planet to perform a rescue, a group of military excavators find an alien life form that isn't exactly friendly. Face hugging, chest popping and outright carnage ensue, as one by one the crew is left to fend for themselves.This film goes down as a classic, and it well should have. A giant in the sci-fi world directed this (Ridley Scott, 'Blade Runner') and it was written by Dan O'Bannon (who also adapted 'Total Recall' from Philip K. Dick and wrote/directed the horror classic 'Return of the Living Dead'). And a cast consisting of Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm? Amazing! What makes this film great is the real sense of being alone it leaves you with. Even when the crew is grouped together, they know they're trapped millions of miles from home. They must fight to survive, no running possible. The enemy changes and remains unknown, and even one of the crew may not be on their side.This film contains the iconic 'chest-popping scene', which was pretty cool. Granted, after seeing 'Spaceballs' you might be let down by the version in this movie, but it's still pretty memorable. The face-huggers are also creepy, if you can imagine what that must be like to have a slimy, acid-blooded creature suctioned on your face, dropping eggs. Nasty! The film goes from sci-fi to horror and back again, mixing the two together in way that's rarely successful (although I would give a nod to 'Event Horizon' for being a fine exception). They implement the 'final girl' scenario well. I don't mean to ruin the plot for anyone, but not many of the crew survive and one of them is Sigourney Weaver (which I suppose is obvious since she's in all the sequels). She knows how to be tough, even if she's not exactly pretty while doing it. (I think horror fans crave attractive women more than science fiction fans do, if this film is any evidence.) My only complaint with this film is the alien suit, which seemed too rubbery and human-like. Luckily, the director was smart and saved the reveal until much later in the movie and kept it to a minimum. Sometimes the unseen is scarier than the seen, especially if you aren't able to make the monster as scary as you planned (which is fixed in future sequels).If you haven't seen this one, see it. It sets the bar for all future science fiction films, particularly ones involving hostile alien life. I don't know if a film in the genre can be made any more without somehow paying their respects to this one.",9,3,5,28 August 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Tim Burton is Back in Full Force
","Sweeney Todd returns to London years after his wife was taken from him and committed suicide. Now, with the help of macabre friend Mrs. Lovett, he will seek his revenge on all of London... but specifically the judge who stole his wife from him. At the same time, the judge has a new captive, who is the love interest of Todd's young comrade.I have had my doubts about Tim Burton in recent years. He was always amazing and had a good way to mix the dark, Gothic themes with wackiness. All through the 1980s and 90s he was unstoppable. Then, 'Planet of the Apes' came out and was a knife through my heart. After this, he was hit and miss. 'Big Fish' was great while 'Corpse Bride' was bland. Now, with 'Sweeney Todd', Burton finds his groove: the dark blossoms here under his command.If you don't like musicals, you won't like this film. There really isn't much dialog in the film at all. And if you don't like blood, you may not like this film, because there's plenty of it. And I have to give Burton credit for the use of computer animation here: the blood is very fake, as are several shots of the streets of London. But he presents them in a way where I feel he tried to make them look how they look, rather than presenting rubbish and calling it art. So I didn't mind.Johnny Depp shines, and this is a nice role for Alan Rickman. I think Sacha Baron Cohen was especially notable, being humorous but also coming across very professional. And the singing was quite good. I mean, it was actually quite good. And the songs were a good mix of Broadway and dark humor... much better than the same old point of view from 'Rent'.I recently watched a BBC production of 'Sweeney Todd', and the differences are striking. The BBC had a darker, more nihilistic Todd, whereas this one was more vengeance oriented (and there was more of a love story). I like how they varied, and they co-exist nicely -- being so different, one is not 'better' than the other, just a different angle. I strongly suggest both are watched by people who love the story.I don't see this being a film I would watch often, as it is a musical and one must be fairly involved to follow the story (at least for the first few viewings). But it is exceptional, and I think Burton was the right man for the job.",7,1,3,15 January 2008
The Polar Express," A More Recent Christmas Classic
","On Christmas Eve, a doubting boy (Tom Hanks) boards a magical train that is headed to the North Pole and Santa Claus's home.So this is based on a book that looks beautiful and people love it, but is relatively short. How do you make such a short book into a full-length feature film? Normally, you either would not try, or you would try and fail. Somehow they tried and succeeded. Robert Zemeckis, you genius.They captured the spirit, they captured the artwork... and they made it fun and even a little bit exciting. Well played, everyone. And a special congratulations to Tom Hanks for not only producing the film, but doing several voices, as well. Wow.Not sure that putting Aerosmith in the film was necessary. In fact, you know, it was not... but oh well. And there seems to be this idea that the film has metaphorical imagery for God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. I have my doubts about that. This was certainly not present in the book, and seems unnecessary in the film...",7,1,3,6 December 2012
Malcolm X," The Spike Lee Masterpiece?
","Biographical epic of the controversial and influential Black Nationalist leader (Denzel Washington), from his early life and career as a small-time gangster, to his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam.I think people would generally say 'Do the Right Thing' is Spike Lee's masterpiece, but that film is challenging and hard to swallow at times. That may make it powerful and artistic, but it is hard to compete with 'Malcolm X', which tells true history and explains much about the black man's plight in America. And with Denzel Washington, one of the greatest actors, in the lead, it is hard to deny its wide appeal.Lee is a great director for pushing 'black cinema' (if such a thing exists). And this is the film that really makes it real, gets to the heart of what is wrong with how mainstream (white) society treats the black man. This should be required viewing.",8,2,5,30 August 2015
The Best Years of Our Lives," Those Left Behind
","Three WWII veterans return home to small-town America to discover that they and their families have been irreparably changed.Such a powerful film. At first the new lives of the soldiers seem to be facing small adjustments, such as their children's interest in 'atomic energy' and 'scientific efficiency'. But soon we find that jobs are hard to find, and the wives and girlfriends sometimes met new people while the battles were fought.Although a serious topic, the film has the right balance of entertainment and drama. It never gets outright depressing, and things like depression and suicide are overlooked. But it still remains a valuable lesson: as bad as dying in the war is, sometimes the transition back to normalcy can be just as damaging.Although not one of the better known movies today (2014), 'The Best Years of Our Lives' won seven Academy Awards in 1946, including Best Picture, Best Director (William Wyler), Best Actor (Fredric March), Best Supporting Actor (Harold Russell), Best Film Editing (Daniel Mandell), Best Adapted Screenplay (Robert Sherwood), and Best Original Score (Hugo Friedhofer).

The Town," Great Crime Movie
","As he plans his next job, a longtime thief (Ben Affleck) tries to balance his feelings for a bank manager (Rebecca Hall) connected to one of his earlier heists, as well as the FBI agent (Jon Hamm) looking to bring him and his crew down.While Affleck had grown up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he barely heard of Charlestown before joining the project. Regardless, he was a good fit for writer and director, if not star, because of his connection to Boston. Besides him and Matt Damon, who in Hollywood really represents Boston? They have been real champions of the city and its stories.Jeremy Renner was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance, and this was well-deserved. From the moment he appears on screen, audiences know he is the power behind the film (with all due respect to Affleck). He has the look and the skills.In the tradition of 'Heat' and 'The Departed', this is a great crime movie, one of a growing number centered around Boston (thanks for this, Whitey Bulger). And now, thanks to an extended version, fans can enjoy it for two and a half hours (with or without Affleck commentary).",7,0,0,3 November 2014
Battleship Potemkin," Greatest Silent Film Ever?
","A dramatized account of a great Russian naval mutiny and a resulting street demonstration which brought on a police massacre.What can I say about this film? It has earned the rare 10 out of 10 from me. I have now rated over 1600 movies, and maybe five have earned a ten. That puts this film in an elite group, in the top 0.5% It is beautiful, and I have to thank the good people at Kino for that. They keep taking old films and making them like new. Every film they have restored has impressed me. This one even more so... it may be Soviet propaganda, but it is glorious propaganda (and allegedly Charlie Chaplin's favorite film).Oddly, Ivan Butler wrote about this film in his history of horror book. This is not a horror film by any stretch of the imagination, but he mentions it for the 'macabre' moments. An old woman whose eye is shot out, meat that is crawling with maggots (beating Lucio Fulci by many decades). It is real in its disturbing nature, which means something by 1920s standards.Where does this fit in the history of cinema? It is the odd one out. Germany had some great silent films, as did America. We rarely hear of Russia in this context, and no Russian director is a household name like Buster Keaton or Fritz Lang. But 'Potemkin' is that rare film that defied the bigger film industries of Hollywood and Ufa... and may be the greatest silent film ever made.",10,0,2,25 May 2011

","After inadvertently wreaking havoc on the elf community due to his ungainly size, a man raised as an elf at the North Pole (Will Ferrell) is sent to New York in search of his true identity.I am really hit and miss with Will Ferrell. I really enjoy some of his work (especially 'Anchorman') while other things he does are just too silly and juvenile. This falls somewhere in the middle.Hipsters are happy to see Zooey Deschanel in this movie. I am more concerned with why she and Will Ferrell are matched up. If it is not strange enough that she would fall for a seemingly psychotic homeless man, there is a thirteen year age difference. That is just slightly creepy (though not really unheard of).After multiple viewings, I can see how the film is charming in its own way and there are even some subtle nods to Ray Harryhausen and Peter Billingsley. Any film that pays homage to these two has to be worth something.",6,1,4,20 November 2011
Taxi Driver," Well-Made Film, Though Not Sure It Stands Time For Me
","A taxi driver (Robert DeNiro) grows sick of the filth he sees in society, or at least New York. Attracted to a political campaign volunteer (Cybil Shepherd), he tries to find some redeeming qualities in life... but his brief hope in politics is dashed and he realizes the only way to clean up New York is with his own hands.I am unsure how I feel about 'Taxi Driver'. I liked it. Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro are a great team, and the gritty violence of this film really is portrayed in a way that captures the viewer in a death grip. Jodie Foster is amazing, especially considering her age, and the historical place this movie has (given the Reagan shooting and all) makes it timeless regardless of the film's merits.But it has its flaws. The film quality is grainy (though, as i say, this adds to the gritty feeling). Harvey Keitel, despite being a great actor, is in the wrong role. And compared to some of Scorsese's other work, this doesn't come across to me as some of his better material. His more recent contributions -- 'The Departed' and 'Gangs of New York', for example -- are vastly superior in pretty much every way. While 'Taxi Driver' is not a bad film, it is easily overshadowed by the other Scorsese offerings.If you haven't seen it, I would recommend you do. If for no other reason than giving Scorsese a fair chance, this is worth checking out. The man has been sidelined for too long and someday critics and other people will look back and see his body of work as powerful and influential art.",8,4,8,29 August 2009
Shutter Island," Scorsese and DiCaprio Do It Again
","US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are dispatched to Shutter Island, a facility that combines mental health treatment and criminal detention. One patient, Rachel Solando, is missing and has slipped through the walls as if through evaporation. Where on the island could she have gone?DiCaprio and Scorsese are a great team, let's just say that right away. If you've seen 'The Aviator', 'The Departed' or -- my favorite -- 'Gangs of New York', you are aware of the greatness these two can achieve. While I do not feel 'Shutter Island' is on par with 'Departed' or 'Gangs', it can still be counted as a fine film in its own right.The scenery captures the feel of the 1950s and the dank lonesome feeling that accompanies insane asylums of this period. Much like Arkham Asylum, the very building itself comes off as creepy and disturbing as those it houses. Poorly lit, plenty of stairs and mezzanine, and a feeling of oozing insanity. The inmates here are nasty, not least of which is George Noyce (played by the same man who brought us Rorschach and the upcoming Freddy Krueger). Michelle Williams, while only seen in dreams and flashbacks, really captures the viewer with her role of Dolores. This is quite possibly her best role yet, overshadowing her work in 'Brokeback Mountain'. Could we see a Best Supporting Actress nod? I freely admit that tears were brought to my eyes by her performance.I appreciated how closely the film followed the book by Dennis Lehane (author of 'Mystic River'). Unfortunately for those who read it, the twists won't be as shocking, though you might pick up on the clues before your friends do. The film downplays much of the detective aspect, and almost completely removes the code-breaking parts. You could fairly say it has been dumbed-down.Scorsese, or his screenwriter, have also added in plenty of extra violence to turn this into a bit of an action flick. An extra gun shot here, a needle there, a firing squad sequence... this works well to keep viewers engaged. At the same time, the inclusion of the Dachau flashbacks dragged the pace down, and I think this will not work with some audiences. The biggest complaint I've heard yet was about the film's length.After seeing what I felt were disappointing previews for 'Shutter Island', the film comes out well and on par with the book, a rare event. They use every tool at their disposal to amp up the visuals, and while the final twist may have you recalling other films (it's not the most original), all in all it's a fine piece of cinema. Along with 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus' and 'Youth in Revolt', it is one of the best films of 2010 (so far).",8,13,27,19 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Espionage Superhero
","As Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) struggles to embrace his role in the modern world, he teams up with another super soldier, the Black Widow, to battle a new threat from old history: an assassin known as the Winter Soldier.This was a very clever plot idea. Rather than the super villains of other heroes, have Captain America take on his own spy agency. This is the sort of thing one might expect in the Nick Fury comics, but Cap fills the role in nicely here. (Apparently Cap is replacing Fury, as now we see that he had the 'Howling Commandos' in World War II, a group formerly lead by Fury in the traditional continuity).Apparently the Russo Brothers wanted to keep visual effects to a minimum, and this was a wise choice. Unfortunately, the effects kept in look really bad. How this got an Oscar nomination is unclear, because the scenes are just so animated-looking. Cap on the plane, attacking it with a shield? Could probably have been done without effects, and now looks silly.At least we finally got to see Samuel L. Jackson in an impressive car chase.",7,0,1,17 January 2015
Capote," Phil Hoffman Nails It
","In 1959, Truman Capote (Phil S. Hoffman) learns of the murder of a Kansas family and decides to write a book about the case. While researching for his novel 'In Cold Blood', Capote forms a relationship with one of the killers, Perry Smith, who is on death row.I watched this as a double feature with 'In Cold Blood' (1967) and I am glad I did. I recommend this approach for just about anyone. The story is then told from two different perspectives, and really shows how Capote inserted himself into the narrative. Is 'In Cold Blood' completely factual? Probably not. And neither is 'Capote', but together they tell a really great narrative about crime, punishment, and the journalists that cover them. (As a true crime writer myself, I can relate.)",8,1,1,26 May 2015
Life of Pi," The Spiritual Event of 2012
","A young man (Suraj Sharma) who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome Bengal tiger (Richard Parker). Let me first say that I am glad that M. Night Shyamalan did not end up directing this film. Could he have made it successful? Possibly. But, he does have a stigma attached to him that Ang Lee does not have. Lee may not be a critically-heralded director, but he is not a running joke, either. And after this film, he may start getting more offers.Lee says in making this film, he had to 'disguise a philosophical book as an adventure story'. Although I have not read the book, this sounds spot on. The concepts presented are certainly religious, or at least spiritual, and there is always the feeling that there is more going on than the parts we can see with our eyes.Roger Ebert called the film 'a miraculous achievement of storytelling and a landmark of visual mastery'. I will grant that it was excellent storytelling, and would need at least two viewings to fully appreciate. The visual mastery is a bit harder for me to get behind. Some of the visuals are spectacular, while others I felt never quite seemed real enough. Technology has come a long way, but I still know a fake tiger when I see one.The story works great, and carries itself in three stages. (Here is where the spoilers start, so stop now if you have not seen it.)The first stage is the overt religious and spiritual stage. Once we get past the jokes about 'Piscine Patel', we see a brief exploration of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. Certainly nothing thorough, but we get the idea of how we can approach the world seeing one god as many, or many gods as one, and not find it to be contradictory. If the film is going to convince us to believe in God, we have to join him on this quest. (I suspect it goes deeper in the book.)The second stage is during the days at sea. We have the reference to Richard Parker, here a name for a tiger but also the name of a classic shipwrecked sailor. In some ways, the story here parallels that of the real-life sailor and the Parker from the Edgar Allen Poe story. We also have the introduction of 'Tsimtsum'. I did not know the term while watching the movie, but felt it must have been important. (Why a Japanese ship had a Hebrew name is anyone's guess.) I now know it is a Kabbalah term about God's being simultaneously transcendent and within the world. A concept that is both contradictory and necessary. It also explains how Pi survives...The third stage is the last few minutes, when we hear the parallel story about the cannibalistic cook. Is this the real story? Is it a metaphor for the other story, which was actually the true story? Is either one true? And ultimately, does it matter? Here, after we are immersed in faith for two hours, we are left to decide: which is the true story, and does it matter which? (With Pi the only survivor, any story he creates will be the only story that will be recorded as the true story -- he has essentially created his own world.)",8,10,20,24 February 2013
Over the Top," Despite Nothing Nice To Say, Still an Enjoyable Film
","Sylvester Stallone stars as Sylvester Stallone, though unlike his usual appearance as a down-and-out boxer who comes back to fight in a championship, this time Stallone is a down-and-out truck driver who comes back to fight in a championship. So don't worry if you thought Stallone might try to do something un-Stallone (he wrote this screenplay, too). Along the way, he must reclaim the love of his son he abandoned and fight off thugs and professional wrestlers who show up to steal his son and arm wrestle him for kicks. This film has a multitude of plot holes and whoever edited this film should be shot for not noticing that Stallone's name changes a dozen times throughout the film. Despite this, the film is still fun in an 80s Stallone sort of way, and like all great 80s films contains a montage theme song from Kenny Loggins, turning a son's hate into love with less than 30 seconds on the clock. Not recommended, unless you're drunk.",6,2,4,4 September 2005
Lost in Translation," I Was Lost in the Eyes of Scarlett and Bill
","This is a film, written and directed by Nicolas Cage's cousin, about either absolutely nothing or absolutely everything. Two strangers meet in Japan where nobody speaks English - not even subtitles - and both conspire to cheat on their spouse, though neither of them admits it or ever really acts on it. Bill Murray plays a washed-up alcoholic actor who suffers a mid-life crisis and enjoys long walks on the beach. Scarlett Johannsson also stars, being primarily a scantily-clad young vixen who is placed in this film for no really obvious reason other than to sexually frustrate the male audience for months on end. Despite the fact she is hideously deformed in real life, her Hollywood beauty shines through in this film. Anna Faris appears playing Cameron Diaz and being just ditsy enough not to be appealing or interesting. Lots of really cool things happen, but the bottom line is that life is simply a series of phases - in one, you love ponies - in a second, it's photography - and in the third phase, you lust over a wrinkled old lush twice your age. This movie is really highly recommended by both myself and the critics, though damned if I know why.",8,5,7,4 September 2005
Doctor Strange," A Slightly Different Marvel Film
","While on a journey of physical and spiritual healing, a brilliant neurosurgeon (Benedict Cumberbatch) is drawn into the world of the mystic arts.One of the biggest problems with the Marvel film series is how clogged up they get and how hard it is to keep the plots and subplots straight. This is also their strength, as it ensures that people will keep watching the next entry. With 'Doctor Strange', we avoid that issue altogether... even though we get vague references to the other films in the series, you do not need to know what an 'infinity stone' is to appreciate the movie.The character of Strange is a good one and not your typical hero. Personally, I found the effects to be over-the-top, as they are in many of the Marvel films. But the 'Inception' look aside, the plot is certainly unique. Seeing how Strange is used in the future, as he is not often connected to the Avengers in the comics, will be interesting. Perhaps this will open the door for Moon Knight or some other supporting character?",7,1,1,3 July 2017
Barry Lyndon," Not Kubrick's Best, Though A Great Film Just the Same
","'Barry Lyndon' is the tale of a young man who comes into power by a stroke of fate. Ryan O'Neal does a fine job in this role, which is bittersweet, knowing that he has such potential but will forever be overshadowed by his girlfriend, Farrah Fawcett.I have nothing really of consequence to say here. I can marvel at the technical skill it took to film by candlelight and whatnot, but others have spent plenty of time on this. In short, the film is a masterpiece, as all of Kubrick's films are. I don't think it's his best work, and it's certainly not my favorite, but as I said, even his least is better than many other directors' best. So, regardless of where you rank this in his career, it's a winner.",7,1,6,2 May 2010
Interstellar," Absolutely Brilliant
","A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival.Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a 'Hathaway hater' like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in 'Wild'.This may be the greatest ever film about physics.",9,10,21,25 January 2015
Full Metal Jacket," One of Kubrick's Most Celebrated Films
","A young man (Private Joker) joins the military as a journalist. He follows the other men through basic training, which is brutal and degrading. After being sent to Vietnam, things seem to only get worse, if such a thing is possible.This is a break-out films for Vincent D'Onofrio, who plays the plump Pvt. Pyle. He's almost unrecognizable as such a slobby character, who plays a crucial role in here. And, of course, this is the role that made R. Lee Ermey famous, as Gny. Sgt. Hartman. Who can picture Ermey without seeing him yelling at new recruits, telling them how worthless they are? I have always had mixed feelings on this film. On one hand, I have tried to watch it a few times in the past and failed to finish it because it seems to lose a lot of momentum after the basic training part. But being older and watching it again, I get a much fuller sense of this film's beauty. It's a visual wonder (what else from Kubrick?), but more importantly a great exposition of the war, and the dehumanizing effects of war in general.I did not realize the film was released in 1987. I had always figured it was a late 1970s or early 1980s film due to the way they captured the time period so well. So I commend them on that. And there's no pulling punches: dead Vietnamese, prostitution, suicide. This film tells the gritty details. Other films about Vietnam are good: 'Casualties of War' is alright and 'Platoon' is still classic, but I think it's more or less undisputed that 'Full Metal Jacket' is the clincher. (I've never been a fan of 'Apocalypse Now', but maybe it's time for me to revisit that one, too.) I title this review one of Kubrick's most celebrated rather than one of his best, simply because of personal preference. I've always been drawn more to 'A Clockwork Orange', and I love 'Lolita', 'Eyes Wide Shut' and 'Dr. Strangelove'. 'Full Metal Jacket' just never carried the same weight with me, though I won't deny it has its place in his long list of achievements.Basically, if you haven't seen this film, it's a must-see. It routinely makes it on 'top 100' lists for films, and with good reason. If you really hate war films, maybe you should steer clear, but the fact remains it's a beautiful piece regardless of the focus. It's inspiration alone (in other films, television and even music) make it something any consumer of modern culture should experience.",8,0,4,9 September 2007
The Grapes of Wrath," Classic Novel Becomes Classic Film
","A poor Midwest family is forced off of their land. They travel to California, suffering the misfortunes of the homeless in the Great Depression.Now, I don't claim to understand the historical accuracy of this film. I don't know much about the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl, or the struggles of the Oklahoma natives in the 1930s. But from what I do understand, Steinbeck told it well and John Ford probably toned it down a little to make it palatable for audiences.Henry Fonda shines here. Although he had already broken out as the title character in 'Young Mr. Lincoln' (1939), also directed by John Ford, he is said to have really launched his career on 'Grapes of Wrath' following his Oscar nomination. Indeed, the best was yet to come, with '12 Angry Men' (1957) still far down the road.",8,0,1,3 December 2014
Pacific Rim," Pleasantly Surprising
","As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.I resisted seeing this film for a while... I was under the impression it was going to be a lot of CGI robots and monsters bashing each other, which I really have no interest in. There is still some of that, but director Guillermo Del Toro made sure that things went a bit deeper than that, with some decent human characters.Really, the casting is to be praised. Del Toro regular Ron Perlman plays one of his best characters yet, and the choice of Charlie Day as a scientist was brilliant. I wasn't sure if he'd be the right sort of person for the story, but he was beyond perfect... that Charlie humor we love, with just a twinge of madness.",7,0,1,14 October 2016
Empire of the Sun," Empire of the Long and Boring
","The story of an atheist who dreams about God playing tennis, while the boy grows up in China during the Japanese occupation (1941). The boy is also fascinated with military aviation and hopes to some day join the Japanese air force. Oh, did I mention this boy is English? And a very, very young Christian Bale? Oh yes! But things change when the war heats up and his parents become separated from him. Then he gets really annoying and tries to surrender 20 times (could have been cut to ONCE) and his accent gets thicker and more irritating. I wished he would die after the first 30 minutes, but no such luck.And why does this movie make the Chinese and Japanese armies look like a bunch of incompetent monkeys? And who's stupid idea was it to throw Ben Stiller in here? At least John Malkovich is cool. But, seriously, what's Steven Spielberg's obsession with little boys? Anyway, the film is both really good and really bad at the same time. While I must say it drags a bit too long for my liking, there were many good things about it. The focus being on the scavengers of a POW camp rather than the actual war made the film entertaining. And the way reality was blended with fantasy was brilliant, although I admit I didn't catch on right away and would probably appreciate these things more with a second viewing... though I have little desire to sit through this again. I am not a Spielberg fan, as his incredible tameness in the world of cinema leaves me feeling empty inside. This film, while better than many of his, still felt like there wasn't enough in it to justify the length.But, who knows, maybe it's just me. Recommended if you're a Malkovich or Bale die-hard ,but otherwise you're not really missing out on anything by skipping this film.",5,45,86,25 February 2006
American Sniper," That Fake Baby
","Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper)'s pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and turns him into a legend. Back home to his wife (Sienna Miller) and kids after four tours of duty, however, Chris finds that it is the war he cannot leave behind.This movie is quite the Rorschach test. Although it does not present the real Chris Kyle (the murderous sociopath) at all, it does give us a film that could be seen as pro-war or anti-war or neither (or both). Clint Eastwood is to be commended for that. If there is a political message to be found, it really is in the eye of the beholder.But that fake baby. You can praise the film and Cooper's performance (which is decent). You can forgive some of the cheesy parts, like the over-a-mile sniper shot... but that fake baby. Oh my goodness, that fake baby.",7,20,46,22 February 2015
Glory," My Apathy Towards the Civil War Did Not Hinder My Viewing
","I really don't want to give this film 8 of 10, but I must. And I'll explain why.My initial impression is that I don't care for Civil War films. And I think Cary Elwes, as much as I love him, was an odd casting choice. And Matthew Broderick in particular seemed odd. In 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off', Broderick successfully played Ferris, who successfully played Abe Froman to get into a French restaurant. However, here Broderick played a spoiled rich kid, who was playing at being a colonel. But I was not finding it successful, I was waiting for the mustache to come off and Ferris to be revealed.Now, once I got over these things, I saw a great film. Morgan Freeman is always great. Denzel Washington was spectacular, especially during the whipping scene (which was quite emotional). The whole struggle of the ex-slaves was presented in a very moving way. (With the exception of one actor or character that seemed to be playing a very modern stereotype.) The story is of Robert Shaw, a real Civil War soldier, and his struggle to get the 54th (an almost all-black regiment) into battle and respected as equals. This is met with a series of successes and failures, as one might expect.I have nothing to say. It's a period piece. If you want to watch an emotional film about the war, check it out. Or even if you life human interest stories, you might find something inspiring in this movie (the war is actually more background than anything). I wasn't expecting to be wowed, but feel better for having this film in my life now. Maybe that means something to you.",8,1,3,19 August 2006
Rocky II," Highly Entertaining
","Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) struggles in family life after his bout with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), while the embarrassed champ insistently goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch.I do not remember Rocky being so dumb in the first film. It is really played up here, and gives the sequel sort of a cheese factor. He misunderstands things, speaks funny, and gets involved in some weird incidents (such as the cologne commercial).But this is probably more entertaining than the original. As good of a film? No. As iconic? No. But fun, and a good excuse to bring Carl Weathers back... that guy is amazing and deserved a bigger career.",7,0,1,31 July 2015
Lion," Excellent, But Sort of Boring
","A five-year-old Indian boy gets lost on the streets of Calcutta, thousands of kilometers from home. He survives many challenges before being adopted by a couple in Australia. 25 years later, he sets out to find his lost family.While this is a great film as far as emotions go, and the lead actors are quite good -- even Rooney Mara reminds us why she is the superior sister -- the general plot is rather boring. That it was nominated so well by the Oscars is odd considering how it is essentially another take on 'Philomena', which had just been released a few years before.The key difference being this is more cross-cultural, as Australia and India are quite different... but the general theme is the same.",6,1,1,22 September 2017
Romeo + Juliet," Baz Luhrmann is the Master of Interpretation
","Prior to watching 'Romeo and Juliet', I had seen 'Moulin Rouge' a few times and loved it. Luhrmann took an opera by Puccini ('La Boheme') and made a great tale of it, with music and visuals that will blow your mind. ('Rent' is also based on 'La Boheme', but is trite and caters to an audience I am not a part of.) My expectations for 'Romeo and Juliet' were fairly high, given my admiration of Luhrmann.As you can guess by my 9 out of 10 rating, I was not disappointed. Luhrmann took the classic Shakespeare and super-imposed it over modern day Verona Beach. Like 'Moulin Rouge' where he took modern rock songs and placed them in 1900 France, here he takes the language of Shakespeare and places it in the contemporary. Rather than simply changing the dialog to modern usage, he gave the text its due.This works incredibly well, and makes the film so much better than regular language would. The story seems richer, more epic and most importantly timeless. And the story is the story of love, which is just that: rich, epic and timeless.And the visuals were stunning! The colors set a mood (such as the darkness after Mercutio's death) and there was such vibrancy in the clothing. The water theme resonated well, with great effects of seeing a lover for the first time through a fish tank, the rain falling at key moments, and the film focusing on both a beach and near a swimming pool.Luhrmann knows how to direct John Leguizamo, and I would say this is one of his two best roles (the other being 'Moulin Rouge'). Harold Perrineau (Mercutio) shows great range, much more so than in other roles he's had since ('The Matrix' or TV's 'Lost'). And this is probably the most un-funny Jamie Kennedy you'll ever see, which I mean in the most positive way.Claire Danes is a delightful Juliet, giving a memorable performance (easily the peak of her career). She is physically perfect for the role, young and beautiful without being overly vulnerable or sexed-up. The only other actress I can picture capable of this kind of role is Julia Stiles, but I can't see her being as much of a fit and she would likely over-act... her Shakespeare style and Luhrmann's are not in synchronicity.The role of Romeo, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, was perfect. Nobody could have been better. This isn't the young Leo from before or the rough and rugged Leo that appears in films later on. This is the Leo on the verge of adulthood, but still remaining tender enough to have the youthful idealism of a Romeo. As my co-viewer phrased it, he's a 'babe' (in more ways than she meant). I know of no other actor who has the acting abilities of Leo, at least not in his age range. He has a long career ahead of him if he can keep up the intensity he has here (as well as in 'The Departed' and 'Gangs of New York'... though not as much in 'The Beach').A slight note on the music: As much as I love the Cardigans, I almost think 'Lovefool' was a poor choice for this film... too poppy. But everything else was great: Butthole Surfers, Everclear, and especially One Inch Punch with the inspired 'Pretty Piece of Flesh'. And Garbage, a vastly under-appreciated band, with one of their better tunes, '#1 Crush'. A great album for a great film.If you haven't seen this film, your life is not complete. I went eleven years avoiding Romeo and Juliet, but having now broken my vow, I am glad I did. This film doesn't just impress, it inspires.",9,0,2,22 October 2006
Forrest Gump," American History Through The Eyes Of A Simpleton
","Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny Curran (Robin Wright), eludes him.This film is fun, funny and touching, if not a little bit sad. If a school wanted to (and no doubt some have), it would be an interesting way to teach the second half of the 20th century. Elvis, Wallace, the Kennedys and more.This is probably the film that 'made' Tom Hanks. Although he was already big in the 1980s with 'Big' (no pun intended), this was probably the turning point where he went from comedy to serious actor (well, somewhat serious). And it probably remains his most-watched movie of all time (well, besides maybe 'Sleepless in Seattle').",8,1,1,4 November 2014
The Passion of Joan of Arc," One of the All-Time Greatest Movies
","A chronicle of the trial of Jeanne d'Arc (Maria Falconetti) on charges of heresy, and the efforts of her ecclesiastical jurists to force Jeanne to recant her claims of holy visions.Dreyer really loves his close-ups in this picture, stressing the rough humanity of the faces -- they are not pretty, but full of emotion and contour. I can see why it was a commercial flop, as it is not terribly entertaining... but the pure genius of the film can be appreciated from a critical point of view.Mordaunt Hall said 'as a film work of art this takes precedence over anything that has so far been produced. It makes worthy pictures of the past look like tinsel shams. It fills one with such intense admiration that other pictures appear but trivial in comparison.' That might be a bit of a stretch, but I can hardly disagree too strongly. My only real complaint is that Joan of Arc was 19 at the time of trial... and Falconetti was 35 or 36. But I cannot fault her acting.The Criterion Collection comes with Richard Einhorn's 'Voices of Light' as an optional score to the film. I strongly recommend this. While the film is powerful even silent, Einhorn nailed the feeling and more... I cannot imagine a better musical attachment to such a film.",9,2,4,12 June 2013
Gone Baby Gone," Best Move in Ben Affleck's Career?
","Quick review: Ben Affleck has already had a pretty busy career, and has won Oscar gold with 'Good Will Hunting'... but this may be his best move yet. Choosing not to cast himself, but instead his brother Casey (who is a decent actor and also doesn't have the distraction factor of Ben) was wise. Much of the plot is hard to believe, but one suspects this is how the book is, and Affleck condensed it into a film that makes sense and still tells a complex story... I'm tempted to read the book, because if the 'book is always better than the movie' is true... I can't imagine how great this book must be. Affleck sells not just this film, but the original story.",8,0,1,27 May 2010

In this version, monsters only scare children because it generates electricity, and the monsters actually fear children, believing them to be toxic.Of Pixar's films, this is definitely one of the more iconic and memorable, right up there with 'Toy Story'. As of now (2015), there has been one sequel, but do not be surprised if at least one more comes along.",7,0,2,13 January 2015

","Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, cat burglar Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, plan and pull off a heist that will save the world.I might be in the minority, but I think this is the best film in the Marvel universe yet, or at least in a long time. As the films got bigger, they became more crowded, more full of action, and more full of computer-generated fluff. This film returns to a script, with a solid set of characters. There is still action (because it's a superhero film), but it does not overwhelm the picture.Also, Paul Rudd makes for a great hero. What Marvel has done well is casting actors who add a light and humorous element, even during universe-altering stories. Rudd, Chris Pratt and Robert Downey... these guys are enjoyable and make for heroes we really like to see.",8,0,1,10 April 2016
Bridget Jones's Diary," Not My Cup of Tea
","A British woman (Renee Zellweger) is determined to improve herself while she looks for love in a year in which she keeps a personal diary.Whether or not this is a good film depend on who you are, I suppose. Romantic comedy is not really my cup of tea, and this one is more romantic and less comedy, so it may be even less my cup of tea than just the average romantic comedy. I like Hugh Grant and Renee Zellweger, and this was a good role for Colin Firth before he went A-list... but still, following a woman's love life is not my preferred subject matter.Why this ended up on my list of things to see is completely beyond me, but now it has been seen and cannot be unseen. Let us chalk this up to taking one for the team.",6,0,1,2 April 2015
American Hustle," Top Movie of 2013 Contender
","A con man, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), along with his seductive British partner, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), is forced to work for a wild FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey power brokers and mafia.To best review this film, we need to talk about what the film is and what the film is not. Generally, it is a fictional retelling of the FBI's Operation Abscam, where they used a fake sheik to bribe politicians. However, the emphasis is on fictional, because a great many things have been changed -- most notably, Amy Adams' character is completely invented, along with the love triangle aspect. There is also little evidence of Mafia involvement in the actual operation.So, the storytelling is quite good with a more than adequate script, but it is not by any means a realistic presentation of the facts. If such a movie exists, I would love to see it, but this is not that film.What this film is: a strong showcase for some incredible actors. Adams is at the top of her game here, and easily earns herself the Oscar nomination if not the win (though it is a competitive category this year). Bale, who is always good, also gives a respectable performance, though maybe not his best. Jennifer Lawrence continues to expand her talents and it is no wonder she has quickly become a regular on the red carpet. Even Louis C.K., not generally known for his acting, is top notch here.Bradley Cooper, who I slowly warming to, is the weak link. He plays his part well, but not 'Oscar well', and I am more than a little surprised by his nomination. In my estimation, Adams could win if Bullock does not run away with the statuette, Bale has a shot, Lawrence may squeak by, but Cooper is unlikely. The Globes awarded Adams and Lawrence, which seems about right. If there was an award for 'ensemble cast', they would be a shoo-in, but individually it is a tough call this year.I have a hard time accepting this as a best director nomination for David O. Russell. He may be a great director, and some credit must be given for being the man in charge, but again, this is an actor's film. There is no inventive camera work or lighting or much in the way of technical achievement. With such an impressive cast, I suspect Russell's role was relatively easy. I do not see a best director win for Russell, especially with Alfonso CuarÃ³n as his competition.The film editing category is too difficult to call with my limited knowledge of the process. As for best costume design and best production design, I can see why there were nominations but I suspect a win is unlikely. Maybe for costumes (though it is up against some films that want it badly) but not for production.On to the biggest nomination of all: best picture. Although I have not yet seen all the Oscar nominees, I feel comfortable in saying this not only deserved the nomination but could possibly win. Being up against 'Gravity' and '12 Years a Slave', I suspect a win is unlikely, but it is probably the best film of 2013 I have seen so far. This is a dramatic improvement over 'Silver Linings Playbook'.Moreover, I think a best picture award is fitting. Despite the plethora of nominations the film received, it will not win most of the acting categories and probably not the directing category. But the whole is more than the sum of its parts, and its final form transcends the individual performances and crew achievements.For a great 1970s throwback with action, romance, double dealing, and some of the finest acting of the year, you cannot do better than 'American Hustle'.",8,5,11,10 February 2014
Top Secret!," The Lesser-Known Follow-Up to Airplane
","Parody of WWII spy movies in which an American rock and roll singer (Val Kilmer) becomes involved in a Resistance plot to rescue a scientist (Michael Gough) imprisoned in East Germany.The film features a very young, very skinny Val Kilmer (look at those tiny legs). And apparently he not only does his own singing, but was dating Cher at the time... what the heck? She is 13 years older than him... weird.The German jokes are great, knowing they are not real German. Sadly, I do not know Yiddish so I do not fully get the humor and had to read the translations online. I suspect for those who speak it the humor is more instant and the film is better.

","Twins journey to the Middle East to discover their family history, and fulfill their mother's last wishes.Many of us, sooner or later, get interested in our family history and want to know our roots. Do we have a famous ancestor, or do we have connections to an Indian tribe, or maybe something else completely unexpected. Often, the journey is fascinating and can spark a real interest in history and a connection to our fellow man.Sometimes the journey is not so good. Many of us have Middle Eastern blood in us somewhere. Go back a hundred generations and we can trace our path just about anywhere. And the Middle East, as a whole, is a great place... but this film shows what can happen if the path goes askew.",7,0,2,1 July 2015
The Godfather: Part II," In Some Ways Even Better Than the First One...
","Seven years after the first film, Michael Corelone (Al Pacino) continues his family's quest to become legitimate. Also, more on his father's growing up in Sicily and coming to America. With Vito being played not by Marlon Brando, but Robert DeNiro.) If you liked the first film, you will like this film. If you didn't, you won't. It's really that simple, since you have all the same great people coming together for this film with just as solid a script and acting as you did the first time. You lose Marlon Brando, but you get Robert DeNiro. I consider that a fair trade.This film has two things going for it: it has the early years of Don Corleone, which really fills in the missing mythos around the family. Without this, the film would appear to show the Corelones were always powerful, which is far from the truth. It does not explain how Don Corelone grew to talk in such a mumbled voice, though.Also, I really enjoyed the entire Cuba sequence, because it put the film in a historical time frame (and I like Cuba). I was never fully sure when the first film was taking place, but this one made sure I knew the years when Don Coreleone was growing up and that the present day was not 1974, but rather in roughly 1958-1959. That changed my perspective on things completely.If you have invested three hours in the first film, invest three more in this one. Why only get half the story of Vito Corleone? I cannot make any suggestions for part three, though, one way or the other.",9,6,9,16 October 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Good Action, The Best Bourne?
","Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) dodges a ruthless CIA official (David Strathairn) and his agents from a new assassination program while searching for the origins of his life as a trained killer.There are some concerns about this film. First, the continuing use of Julia Stiles, who has proved herself to be a very average actress. Although she showed promise in the 1990s, it never seems to have panned out. But, at least, she is in relatively few scenes.Second, the use of the shaky camera. While this may be effective for chase scenes and to suggest fast-paced action, the film tends to use it in almost every scene. More often than not, it is not necessary and just gives the impression that the crew had attention deficit problems. (Director Paul Greengrass likes his shaky camera, but he also knows how to keep it under control for films like 'Captain Phillips').As far as a straight action and spy thriller, this is excellent, and very entertaining. Exactly why it gets the critical praise it does is unclear; the Academy was right to nominate it only for technical aspects. But sometimes fun is all you need.",7,0,0,6 December 2014
10 Things I Hate About You," One of the Definitive 1990s Movies
","A new kid (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) must find a guy to date the meanest girl in school (Julia Stiles), the older sister of the girl he has a crush on (Alex Mack), who cannot date until her older sister does.There is not much reason to write a review for a film that everybody already loves and that really launched the career of Heath Ledger, one of the better actors of his time. I would just like to comment on how the film has aged over the past fourteen years (I am writing this September 2013).Amazingly, it has done pretty well. The clothes scream 1990s and the bands featured in the film -- Letters to Cleo and Save Ferris -- have long since faded into obscurity. But the update of Shakespeare is still funny with some great observations on high school life.Sadly, this was probably Julia Stiles' best role. She seemed like a breakout actress at the time, but we have since learned that her range is not all that great and she is now the weak spot in such otherwise good films as the 'Bourne' series and the remake of 'The Omen'.",7,0,0,16 September 2013
Fargo," One of the All-Time Greats
","Jerry Lundegaard's inept crime falls apart due to his and his henchmen's bungling and the persistent police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand).The Coen Brothers have consistently created good content for thirty years, with almost everything they touch being golden (or at worst silver). Somehow along the way, 'Fargo' got to be the film most associated with them (even overshadowing the cult hit 'Big Lebowski'). Nothing wrong with that.This is clearly the film that got people to notice Frances McDormand if they had not already done so, and probably lead to much bigger things for Peter Stormare (one of the greatest character actors in the business today).",8,1,4,5 May 2014
Rush," I Don't get It
","The merciless 1970s rivalry between Formula One rivals James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda.This film has spent the last few years on the IMDb Top 250. And I have no idea why. The characters are not deep, the cinematography is muted and not all that enjoyable. The plot is basically just two men who want to beat the other in a race. This is nothing all that innovative. Ron Howard has been involved in this sort of film since 1976's 'Eat My Dust' (which is more enjoyable).Clearly there is something I am missing, but this has to rank up there with all those Indian movies for the most over-rated on IMDb. And, when you are talking about IMDb, most of it is over-rated.",6,3,7,2 July 2015
Predator," Ridiculously Over-rated
","A team of commandos, on a mission in a Central American jungle, find themselves hunted by an extra-terrestrial warrior.Initial critical reaction to Predator was negative, with criticism focusing on the thin plot. Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times described it as 'grisly and dull, with few surprises. However, in subsequent years critics' attitudes toward the film warmed, and it has appeared on a number of 'best of' lists. This reversal is just plain sad.On top of the thin plot, there is a lot of sitting around, and the 'predator vision' has not held up over the years. A bit of editing, maybe cutting out twenty seconds here or there, would do wonders. While Stan Winston and crew deserve credit for creating an iconic monster, the film itself never really takes off until well over an hour.",6,3,11,20 December 2013
Notting Hill," Tolerable By Romantic Comedy Standards
","The life of a simple bookshop owner (Hugh Grant) changes when he meets the most famous film star in the world (Julia Roberts).What I really enjoyed about this film is the guest stars. Alec Baldwin shows up unannounced for a brief but crucial scene. Heck, even Mischa Barton appears as the child actor whom Will pretends to interview for Horse & Hound. Of course, when the film came out no one knew who Barton was, but that is what makes looking back at movies fun.Beyond that, it is your typical romantic comedy. I suppose it is slightly different in that the main character is male rather than female, and Grant is more charming than the average male lead. In fact, Grant is the saving grace of this film, because Julia Roberts is just as awful as ever. Her character is uptight and only opens up in the second half, completely without any reason.",6,0,3,25 February 2016
Nightcrawler," One of the Best Films of 2014
","When Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a driven man desperate for work, muscles into the world of Los Angeles crime journalism, he blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story. Aiding him in his effort is Nina (Rene Russo), a TV-news veteran.Despite what the Academy decides, this was among the best pictures of 2014. And, at the very least, this was the best performance of Gyllenhaal's career and he may likely never match it again. Bill Paxton was a bit odd, and whoever scripted the word 'brah' made a serious error, but Gyllenhaal is unstoppable.And the film doubles as an action film (with impressive car chases and fire fights), or triples as a satire of the news industry... pointing out the well-known phrase 'it bleeds, it leads' is even more true on television. Most amazing of all, perhaps, is that this is the director's debut.",9,3,6,4 January 2015
LÃ©on: The Professional," One of the Greats of the 1990s
","Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a 12-year-old girl, who is reluctantly taken in by LÃ©on Montana (Jean Reno), a professional assassin, after her family is murdered. LÃ©on and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his protÃ©gÃ©e and learns the assassin's trade.This is what you get if you take 'Lolita' (sort of) and put it in the middle of a world with mobsters and hit men. And then casting for perfect actors? Priceless. Luc Besson probably had no idea that Portman would go on to be the international sensation she has become.Of course, we also have a solid performance from the always-impeccable Gary Oldman. Very few actors are working on his level. Maybe Daniel Day-Lewis, possibly Christian Bale. But Gary Oldman can be anyone and delivers 100% every time.Roger Ebert gave the film only two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, 'Always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action... In what is essentially an exerciseâa slick urban thrillerâit seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it.' Not to disregard his concern, but time seems to be against Ebert here. The film has steadily gone up in praise over the years, possibly due to Portman's rising star.",9,3,5,21 November 2014
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Much more hyped than it really deserves.
","Robin Williams plays Adrian Cronauer, a real-life DJ stationed in Vietnam. He confronts authority and does what he can to defend the Vietnamese people, while befriending one man and trying to date his sister with moderate success. And then things go downhill.I can sum this movie up in one sentence: Robin Williams is not funny. The film is full of him ad-libbing voices where he's a homosexual, or a redneck or referencing people that were probably forgotten in 1987, and definitely today. He's decent as an actor when not trying to be funny, but every attempt at humor falls flat. To make matters worse, people in the background are literally falling out of their chairs with laughter... I don't think so.Forest Whitaker is in this, and plays more or less no role other than to follow Cronauer around and be a somewhat dim-witted sidekick who can't ride a bike or start a jeep properly. That's unfortunate that Whitaker was sidelined for Williams.You've most likely seen this film, as it has aired on television a million times in the past twenty years. I avoided it, and only came to view it by random happenstance. This was, as it turns out, a mistake, and I was right to avoid it. (Also, if you have any interest in real Vietnam War history, the actual Cronauer makes it clear that Williams did not portray him even remotely accurately.)",6,5,10,4 September 2009
Burn After Reading," Another Win for the Coens
","An alcoholic, terminated CIA agent (John Malkovich) decides to write his memoirs. His wife, who is cheating on him with another federal agent (George Clooney), accidentally steals the memoir when she is retrieving the couple's financial records. This disc, due to the negligence of a law clerk, then falls into the hands of two fitness trainers (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt), one of whom is also sleeping with the adulterous federal agent. From there, mayhem and blackmail ensue.Can the Coen Brothers make a bad film? I mean, I suppose the answer is yes. But I have yet to see one. Without skipping a beat, they go from a serious Oscar-winning drama ('No Country For Old Men') to a silly, effective comedy. And they excel in both genres equally well. I think some people may have been let down by 'Burn' because they expected another Oscar film, but these people missed the point.The plot is so intertwined (not unlike past Coen films, like 'The Big Lebowski') that trying to figure out what's going on and who is working for who is half the fun. And every character has their idiosyncrasies, making them each unique and funny in their own way. Being able to write such a script and plot is a gift, and the fact they've done this successfully multiple times really makes me feel that the Coens are going to go down as some of the greatest creators of their generation.Fans of 'The Big Lebowski' will like this one. The style is similar, and the cast is amazing: Pitt, Clooney and Malkovich? You really have to be a cynical person to not be interested in this one.",8,3,8,29 August 2009
Watchmen," A Movie Adaptation Worthy of the Comic
","In an alternate world set in 1985, Nixon is still president and the two superpowers are on the brink of nuclear war. The only deterrent, Dr. Manhattan, has turned his back on humanity and fled the planet... pushing the doomsday clock even closer to midnight. Can Manhattan be persuaded to return to Earth, or is this the end of the human race? Watchmen is a brilliant comic and a brilliant movie. It explores politics, ethics, deviant sexuality and still contains a great superhero vibe for those who just like butt-kicking. The graphic novel was a landmark achievement, and after years of handing the script from one person to another, Zack Snyder has emerged as the man capable of putting it together, and impressing us all. Few adaptations do justice to the original, but 'Watchmen' does an amazing job. As an added bonus, largely unknown actors were cast... not creating a distraction of one character over another when all (or at least most) have their own unique, important tales to tell.The political aspects are numerous -- nuclear war, Soviet versus American aggression, the term limits of presidents, vigilantism and the Keene Act (paralleling the X-Men's 'Days of Future' storyline). But it is the moral aspect that really tugs at me. 'Let justice be done, though the whole world perish' is a quote from Immanuel Kant, but it could apply to Rorshach. He is debatably the hero of the story with a strongly defined morality (Kant's consequentionalism) blended with seeming insanity, though he is the only one trying to make the world better one person at a time.A very extreme utilitarianism emerges in one of the characters towards the end -- can we sacrifice the few to save the many? Rorshach would clearly oppose this, but if the outcome is positive, can the action be justified? This poses a difficult problem for the viewer and the characters, because the action is so heinous yet the outcome so bountiful... is it wrong or necessarily right? (I'd be more specific and address this more, but I don't wish to give away the plot.) While 'Spiderman' and 'X-Men' get all the attention, it is films like 'Watchmen' that leave a lasting impression in my mind ('The Spirit', too). Even 'The Dark Knight' or 'Batman Begins', which are incredible, don't have the power to keep the conversation going hours, days and weeks after viewing them. If you were considering seeing 'Watchmen' but haven't yet, make it a top priority -- this is a film to end all films.",9,3,8,6 August 2009
The Bourne Identity," Refreshingly delicious action flick
","Who knew Matt Damon could be an action hero? He does this quite well in 'Bourne Identity'. (Granted, at times I was distracted by his Boston accent, but even spies can be from Boston, I guess.) Jason Bourne wakes up on a German ship to discover he does not know who he is or what he was doing. The rest of the film is to determine his identity... and this is the film's strong point. While action films are a dime a dozen, action films with a good mystery are harder to come by and this one delivers.Fights, romance (but not too much like James Bond) and intrigue... with a bit of 'Good Will Hunting' mixed in. What Jason Bourne knows is simply amazing but believable in the context of this film.One fight scene was strange because it didn't really make a lot of sense... I won't give away the details, but you'd think if you're assassinating someone you'd want to be silent, but this guy makes as much noise as humanly possible. You know what I mean if you've seen it.Lastly, I want to touch on the women of the film. Choosing the 'Run Lola Run' (aka 'Lola Rennt') star as Damon's co-star was the perfect choice. She's beautiful in an unconventional way, and you know she can fight and run when she needs to (though this is hardly shown in the film). And giving her more American exposure certainly doesn't hurt. Julia Stiles, on the other hand, was a disappointment. I love her in almost everything she does... but I couldn't take her seriously as a government agent. Her theater training made me think she was overdoing her part and she struck me as being too immature to handle clandestine actions. Maybe that's just me... and maybe she gets better in 'Supremacy'... but I'm happy her part was so small.Verdict: 'Bourne Identity' shines.",7,0,1,16 August 2006
Hot Rod," A Decent SNL Spin-Off Film
","The days of the best Saturday Night Live spin-offs are probably gone. Whether you're a fan of Mike Myers, Chris Farley, Will Ferrell or other... most people would agree that the cast of SNL for the past few years (2005-2009) has been lacking. That concern aside, Andy Samberg is one of the best things to come to SNL during this period.As Rod Kimble (a character obviously meant to be played by Ferrell, who has been the lead in pretty much every other comedy of this type), Samberg does some of his finest work outside of the music video world (his 'Lonely Island' stuff will forever be the best). Then, to team him up with Bill Hader and Danny McBride (who is a great supporting actor, horrible lead) is just perfect.Will Arnett and Chris Parnell play important supporting roles, and the lovely Isla Fisher steals the show. I can never get enough of her (though I'm sort of curious what a woman with an Aussie accent is doing in the States).With good random humor (though not great), and some laugh-out-loud dance sequences (far more than in your average film), this one went under the radar but is worth a view if you're up for a comedy. Maybe not as great as, say 'The Hangover', but lovable in its own right.",6,0,3,17 January 2010
The Killing Fields," Maybe I Need A Second Viewing?
","I love John Malkovich and Julian Sands. And I find Cambodia and Pol Pot interesting... but this film just didn't really hold my interest. Some parts are good, others are slow... I don't know. I know this film is praised, and I do not doubt the value of it... I just couldn't find it. Maybe I was distracted, maybe I was in the wrong frame of mind. I don't know. Someday I will see it again and give a better appraisal. But for now, this is it... just a sense of uncertainty. I can't think of any other films about Cambodia (although this was filmed in Thailand), so it's safe to say it's the best of its kind. Actually, come to think of it, with the endless supply of Nazi films, why aren't there more Cambodian or Pol Pot or Khmer Rouge films?",6,5,9,27 May 2010
Grease," Even More Awful than I Expected
","A guy and girl fall in love, but then must return home... only to find out they go to the same high school and act completely different when their friends are around. With the help of some music and dancing, can they make cars into speed demons and ladies into sexual creatures? Oh, I think maybe they can...The only reason I should have watched this film was to see Lorenzo Lamas as Tom Chisum. John Travolta was nothing special, Olivia Newton-John (who the video clerk said would be a guy's dream) was nothing special (and Australian) and Stockard Channing... oh my! Here's the spoiler: after all the singing and dancing is over, the female lead decides that instead of being herself, she is going to start smoking and wear black leather to be with the man she loves, despite the fact the man she loves was only acting at the time. The male lead, who was beginning to change, reverts back to his old self and everyone is happy. Moral: women of the world can only be happy once they give up their identity and become a man's shadow. (Ladies, don't you think there are other man more like you in the world? Just maybe not at Rydell High.) So yeah, I had to watch this against my will. At least my friend Lisa was nice enough to suffer with me. I know the songs, I don't mind the songs (especially when done by Less Than Jake), but the film is just trash and I have no idea how this has become an international sensation.

The Caine Mutiny," The Birth of Michael Caine
","When a US Naval captain (Humphrey Bogart) shows signs of mental instability that jeopardizes the ship, the first officer relieves him of command and faces court martial for mutiny.Although this was relatively late in Bogart's career, it probably ranks among his best roles. Is his character crazy? Maybe, maybe not. But he is certainly paranoid, and Bogart plays it to a tee without going over the top. Well, done, sir. I am sorry they gave you the Oscar for 'African Queen' and not here.This film is a touch of 'Mister Roberts' and a touch of courtroom drama. The blend is excellent, and a very enjoyable film. The strawberry incident is particularly fun and a powerful scene. It just grabs the viewer and holds them in.",8,0,2,20 March 2015
Footloose," Great, Fun 80s Film
","A city teenager (Kevin Bacon) moves to a small town where rock music and dancing have been banned, and his rebellious spirit shakes up the populace.There is really no need to review a film that everyone has already seen, but I will just say this: it is rightfully a classic. Great characters, great actors, great story, great dance moves. The soundtrack alone makes the movie worth watching.Two things of note: one, Chris Penn was really thin and physically fit when he appeared in this film. What the heck happened? Two, why is Ariel supposed to be desirable? She is full of herself, far too head-strong, and openly flaunts her infidelity. There is nothing admirable in her character... surely Ren could do better.",7,2,6,27 April 2013
The Color of Money," Great Film, But Weak By Scorsese's Standards
","This film brings together the classic American actor, Paul Newman, with a popular stud of the time, Tom Cruise. With a notable cameo of Forest Whitaker as Amos the hustler.How to judge this film? It is not as great as Newman's original time around as Fast Eddie ('The Hustler'), but still a great film just the same. And it hardly ranks as one of Cruise's best, though he gets that craziness out of him here (with a bare minimum of running). Scorsese has done better, much better, but he was working within a framework here and I think as far as sequels go, this one is pretty great.A must-see film, not so much because it is one of the better films, but because it has three great giants of film together in one place. Love it or hate it, this is a strong presentation of talent.",7,0,1,13 May 2011
The Thing," John Carpenter's Best Film, At Least Critically
","In Antarctica, there is a science station where Americans run experiments... but more often than not just get drunk. One day, a dog and a group of Norwegians shows up... and thanks to poor translation skills, the Norwegian is killed. Soon after, a horrible fate in unleashed upon the American station... one by one the crew become suspects in a very heinous string of murders. Who is the killer or killers? I like many -- perhaps most -- of John Carpenter's films. The original 'Halloween' and 'They Live' are amazing. Pretty much the bulk of his work pleases me (with a few exceptions). And 'The Thing' is among his best, which both fans and critics alike seem to agree on. You are working with horror, which Carpenter excels at... and you are working with isolation fighting against an outside enemy (which we have seen in 'Assault in Precinct 13', 'Pro-Life' and elsewhere). And we have the ideal Carpenter cast: Kurt Russell as R.J. MacReady, Wilford 'The Beetis' Brimley as Dr. Blair and Keith David as Childs.This also brings Carpenter and Dean Cundey together again. Cundey has said, 'John and Halloween really kicked off my career.' This was their fourth film together, but their first big studio (Universal) production. It was truly a passion project for Carpenter, who idolizes Howard Hawks. The Hawks version of 'The Thing' appeared in 'Halloween', 'Assault on Precinct 13' was more or less a Hawks remake, and now he had the opportunity to tackle this. And wow, they did a bang up job, surpassing the original (though the two are different enough that they can both be appreciated in their own ways).The suspense and isolation work to bring the film to a crescendo of horror perfection. And science fiction fans will love it, too (the border between the two is danced upon quite heavily). But what really makes this film the masterpiece it is -- and what will make it never remakeable -- is the special effects. If you have read enough of my reviews, you will know my strong dislike for modern CGI effects and their 'cartoon' quality. Here, we have a prime example of what I would rather see in a film: good, old-fashioned effects. More realistic than the cartoons and just visually stunning. I have no idea why they started doing things differently, but every film since 'Jurassic Park' has let me down in some way. Rob Bottin is quite possibly the greatest effects master in cinema history.My one concern with this film, and it is very minor, is that the characters are not easy to keep straight sometimes. This goes away with repeated viewings, but aside from the main characters, the secondary characters just seem to blend together. One guy looks sort of like another, and trying to keep the names straight will take a little focus. Some of them do not appear on screen for more than five minutes or have more than a line or two of dialog, it seems. But what good is a killer if you do not have people to kill? Beyond that, what to say? Keith David and Kurt Russell? That does not sell you? Adrienne Barbeau as the computer voice? A dog that kills people with its tentacles? Even the Internet Movie Database seems to think this is one of the best films ever made (well within the top 200) so I am going to go so far as to recommend it to non-horror fans as well. There is just something very tight about this film.Appropriately, Scream! Factory has pulled all the stops and released the film as a double-disc Blu-ray. With a 2K scan, it looks better than ever. We have commentary tracks with Kurt Russell, John Carpenter and Dean Cundey. And plenty of interviews, both new and vintage. If there is not already a book about the making of 'The Thing', someone could probably develop one based solely off the material on the set. It is, without a doubt, the must-have Blu-ray of 2016.",10,2,5,21 December 2007
Armageddon," One of Those Guilty Pleasures
","After discovering that an asteroid the size of Texas is going to impact Earth in less than a month, NASA recruits a misfit team of deep core drillers to save the planet.The real mystery surrounding this film is how it got released by the Criterion Collection. Both this film and Michael Bay's 'The Rock' received the Criterion treatment at one time. And while both are very enjoyable films, do they really belong with Criterion? I feel that by merely being released by them, there is an added importance stamped on the film.But as far as guilty pleasures go, this is a fun and entertaining film. I could do without the romance angle, but the idea of blowing up an asteroid before it hits earth (which assumes a lot of questionable science) is just classic science fiction, here given more legitimacy and budget than ever before.",7,17,19,13 June 2017
The Village," Not Appreciated As Much As It Should Be
","The population of a small, isolated countryside village believe that their alliance with the mysterious creatures that inhabit the forest around them is coming to an end.As of 2015, this is probably M. Night's last good film. Which is unfortunate, because he had a pretty good run for a few years. Some people even want to be harsh on this film, which is unfair. Some either see it as a ripoff (which is possible) or lacking the twist they want. If it is a ripoff, that has no bearing on the film. And the twist? That is an audience expectation... whether it meets your needs or not is on you, not the creators.One thing that did not go well for the film was its marketing, which seemed to present it as a horror film. Some scenes have horror elements, and the score has some horror inspiration. But it really is not that, so much as it is a love story. Sure, it has fantasy elements mixed in, but those are secondary.",7,1,2,24 September 2015
He Got Game," A Strong Film From Spike Lee
","A basketball player's father (Denzel Washington) must try to convince him to go to a college so he can get a shorter sentence.I have mixed feelings about Spike Lee's movies. Some are pretty good, some are rather awful. Even 'Do The Right Thing', his masterpiece, did not really impress me the way it apparently impressed many other people. But I have to say I generally enjoyed 'He Got Game'.I think what sold this was Denzel Washington. Obviously, he is one of the bet actors of this generation (possibly ever). He sells everything, and can even make bad movies seem good. And, overall, I think the story is rather strong. The idea of the kid being named 'Jesus' seems like it was done just for the endless ways the dialogue can be wrapped around it, but at least they offer a plausible reason that he has that name.",7,0,1,4 January 2017
The Revenant," Will Leo Finally Win?
","A frontiersman (Leonardo DiCaprio) on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team.The story of Hugh Glass has gone through a number of revisions in the last two hundred years. There is first of all the true story, which could never be known -- Glass himself likely embellished or mis-remembered certain details. We then have various biographies, a novel, and an earlier film 'Man in the Wilderness' (1971). Surprisingly, the latter has never had a home video release. This seems like the optimal time to cash in. But that is neither here nor there.In this latest version, Glass has a son, which increases the emotional factor. Is it historically accurate? No. But we should not allow the facts to get in the way of a good story.With the Academy Award nominations out, 'The Revenant' has become the film to beat in a variety of categories. With twelve nominations, it is certain to win a few. And the big buzz is that this is the year that Leonardo DiCaprio will take home his first statuette.DiCaprio has been in the acting game for about thirty years and has had countless memorable roles. Some are more serious than others, but he has always done a fine job, even if the films did not call for such professionalism. And as Hugh Glass, this is no doubt the finest performance of his career. Through much of the film, he is left unable to speak and his acting must come out non-verbally, which is considerably more challenging. But winning the award is not supposed to be about an individual actor's best role, but about the best role of the year. Even by those standards, the odds look good. Eddie Redmayne and Bryan Cranston are formidable, and Michael Fassbender is a potential winner (even if he looks nothing like Steve Jobs). But did anyone throw themselves in a role as deep as DiCaprio? Probably not.Tom Hardy, who plays the antagonist, is up for a supporting actor award. By all means, he deserves it. His devilish Fitzgerald is every bit as good as DiCaprio's Glass, and in some ways even more fun to watch. He is a morally reprehensible monster. But the competition in this category is a bit steeper because of a very unlikely opponent: Sylvester Stallone. Few people would consider Stallone a great actor, but he is getting many accolades for 'Creed'. He also has another factor on his side: the subjectivity of Oscar voting. The voters will often vote less on the individual roles and sometimes on an actor's career, especially later in their life. This could be Stallone's chance at a lifetime achievement Oscar. So, hardy deserves to win, but he is not guaranteed by any means.There are a handful of nominations in makeup, costume and production which could get a win. One of the strongest aspects of the film, though, is Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography. This is a tough category, because you have the incredible Roger Deakins and a bold 70mm look on 'Hateful Eight'. But Lubezki is right now the man to beat. He has eight nominations to his credit, and has won the last two years (for 'Gravity' and 'Birdman'). And, frankly, this might be his best work yet. There are some long fight scenes that are reminiscent of Seamus McGarvey's work in 'Atonement' (2007). Could Lubezki win three years in a row? Could be.All that praise aside, there is one category that the nomination was quite wrong: Best Visual Effects. The film has a notorious bear-mauling scene. And while the effects are quite good, there is never any doubt that the bear is a computer simulation. A very nice one, but still fake just the same. And that may take the audience out of the movie a bit, as this otherwise excellent look at the wilderness has a very modern image of a bear transposed in it... This award may end up going to 'Star Wars' regardless, as it tends to be the category for awarding movies otherwise not considered Oscar-worthy.In short: is this DiCaprio's best role? Yes. Also possibly Tom Hardy's best role. And some excellent cinematography. Movie of the year? Perhaps, or perhaps not.",8,2,8,16 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," The Constitution and the Cold War
","During the Cold War, an American lawyer (Tom Hanks) is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers.The film is nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (for Rylance), Best Production Design and Best Original Screenplay. Let us address those in reverse order.There is no doubt the screenplay is strong, and another feather in the caps of the Coen brothers. Whether or not you consider it to be 'best' probably comes down to one thing: do you prefer a good story or do you prefer historical accuracy? If you prefer historical accuracy, you are going to have qualms with this picture because Donovan (Hanks) is very false. He is portrayed as an insurance attorney rather than the intelligence operative he was, and he is shown as the victim of multiple acts of violence, which he was not. So that will be an automatic hangup for some people who frown on dramatic exaggeration and poetic license.If one looks at it a bit more forgivingly, though, it is an incredible script that covers the Constitution, the Cold War, the interaction of various governments and their agents... it tells the story of one attorney defending a despicable client because it is the right thing to do (a la 'To Kill a Mockingbird') and the better-known tale of Gary Powers and the U-2 spy plane. Is it sensationalized? Somewhat. A little melodramatic with its patriotism? Yes. But still a darn fine story, and whether a winner or not, clearly a strong contender for best screenplay.How about production design? This one is a bit of a challenge. The work that went into this film is incredible, bringing everything on screen back to the 1950s and 1960s. Every car, every outfit, and even the most inconsequential detail had to be touched. How you compare this to the futuristic sets of 'Mad Max' or the science-driven world of 'The Martian', who knows? It is like comparing apples and oranges. While 'Bridge of Spies' will probably not carry this category, those who worked on securing all the necessary scenery deserve top honors.The supporting actor category is where 'Bridge of Spies' has its best chance of winning an award. Mark Rylance is not an actor whose work I am familiar with, because he has primarily distinguished himself on the stage. So it is hard to say how much he is going outside of his normal range here. But he gives us an interesting character. While 'best actors' are often intense or pushed to their limits, Rylance is quite the opposite: subtle and understated. But it makes fora powerful, compelling nemesis you cannot help but like in some way. He would be deserving of the award.Which leaves us with best picture. And the short answer is no, this is not a contender. The nomination makes sense, but the film never seems to hit all cylinders. Although nothing is lacking, it still feels somehow incomplete. 'Bridge of Spies' is not the film of the year, nor is it among Spielberg's best.",7,2,4,24 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Coming To a Huge Finale...
","As Harry races against time and evil to destroy the Horcruxes, he uncovers the existence of three most powerful objects in the wizarding world: the Deathly Hallows.I think this film was strong and David Yates did a great job with it, perhaps even better than Guillermo del Toro would have. The return of Dobby is awesome (he is now my favorite character) and the torture scene with Hermione is epic (although cut for the film, I hope to see an extending version some day).The plot is really coming together now, and while there are some things that are not completely clear (I did not read the books), I think I am ready for the final installment.",8,0,2,4 May 2011
The Hills Have Eyes," These Hills Definitely Have More Than Eyes
","I feel that a remake is only fairly judged in comparison to the original. If a bad remake is made, it should receive less respect for ruining a good idea. If a better remake is made, it should be praised for its improvement. But one thing we should never do is give credit to the new movie for things already established in the old movie (why give a writer or director credit for something they just copied?).I ma pleased to say this remake was exactly the best it could have been. It kept all the best scenes, all the best dialogue and added to them. The gore was increased, a whole new extended scene was inserted. The opening credits added more to the feel of the movie than the entire 1970s version had at all. The only thing lacking is the experience of a 70s/80s film you can only get from the the original (or from 'The Devil's Rejects'), but this is also a strength... allowing us to identify better with the new characters and add the new aspect of cellular technology.The story, as you may know, is that of a family stranded in the desert by a nuclear testing site. They are soon attacked by a clan of radiation-affected mutants who also like the taste of human flesh.There isn't much to say. If you like a good survival story or a gorefest, this is a fine film. If you liked the original, you'll probably like this better. I have heard that this director is 'the new Wes Craven'. Not true... he is much better than Craven can ever be (see 'Cursed'). I will gladly see his next film.Bottom line: horror movies should not be remade, and neither should most other movies. This film, however, is the one exception to that rule. See it.",7,0,6,2 April 2006
American Psycho," Dark Commentary on 80s Wall Street Culture
","Patrick Bateman is a heartless man with no concern for those around him. Serial killer... or capitalist? This film explains there might not be much difference and perhaps shows us why serial killers in the 1980s were more celebrated than any time before or since in popular culture.This is not a film for everyone. Some (like myself) will love every little aspect, while others might be turned off my the sex and violence... or just be really confused by the style (the directing is weird, but actually pretty straight-forward once you've read the book). I suppose that is to be expected. Even those looking for a horror film might be let down, as that isn't the real focus here.The cast of this film is amazing. Willem Defoe needs no introduction. Chloe Sevigny (one of my favorites), Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon (not my favorite but good for her role) and Gwen Turner. Even Samantha Mathis shows up. But, of course, stealing the show is Christian Bale.Bale was the perfect choice to play Bateman and I'm glad director Mary Harron would settle for no one else (turning down Ed Norton, who gets compared to Bale but remains inferior). Bale is able to be any character he wants (comapre this to 'Batman Begins', 'The Prestige' and especially 'The Machinist' and see if there's any of the same characters here). As Bateman, he is perfectly self-absorbed and also maniacally distant. The little dance during the Huey Lewis scene (one I have heard he added himself) remains for me one of the two key scenes (the other involving a chainsaw).Besides the great acting (the real reason to watch this), the music is very noteworthy. The book does a fine job of elaborating on the music of the 1980s, and I think they incorporated that well here (throwing it in to death scenes rather than as solo pieces adds an interesting twist). This film, along with the gentlemen I go to the tavern with, really got me into Huey Lewis and Phil Collins. Which is really wonderful. Not so much on the Robert Palmer or Whitney Houston...I guess I should also compliment them on the tasteful way (read: artistic) the sex and violence was done. Ax wounds, chainsaws and bite marks... threesomes and science-knows-what done with a coat hangar. But the vast majority is shot from such angles that it's almost all left to the imagination: you think you see more than you really do.Clearly, I really want you to see this film. It's possibly Bale's best, or at least the one that pushed him into the spotlight. He steals the show. You won't like it if you don't like horror, but the title is 'American Psycho' and the cover has a man with a knife, so you know what you're getting yourself into. Grab some popcorn and a Cherry Coke Zero and kick your feet up. Enjoy!",9,3,6,16 April 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," A Pleasant, Humorous Addition to the Top 250
","A girl and her family travel across the country to have her compete in the Little Miss Sunshine competition. The family, with a genetic ability to lose at everything, is determined to see that in the end they're all winners in one way or another.When this film came out, I didn't know what it was. I saw a preview or two and heard it was good, but I was under the impression it was going to be some pretentious indie film and I wasn't in the mood for that. Some days I am, but I just wasn't feeling it. Somehow I didn't notice it had Greg Kinnear (whom I love) and Steve Carell (although he wouldn't have sold me on it). And so I just let the film pass me by, with plans to see it much later.Well, 'much later' finally arrived on Christmas 2007. And i must say I was pleased -- the humor is there, and of a dark, sarcastic nature I can really appreciate. Death, failure, suicide and misery are the punchlines here (or at least the warm-ups) and I couldn't be more pleased. Most of all I was pleased with Carell, the suicidal uncle. Carell has somehow become seen as something of the new Jim Carrey, which I think has hurt him. Following 'Bruce Almighty' with 'Evan Almighty' and now appearing together in 'Horton Hears a Who' are probably mistakes. But in 'Sunshine', he's not wacky -- he's just honest and plays a good, solid character. It's quite likely he will never have a better role.And truly, the ensemble cast is pretty cool. I wasn't a big fan of the brother. But the grandfather was hilarious, the father alright and the mother a good matriarch. The daughter really did run the show, and I'm glad they were able to find such a decent young actress. They could have cast Dakota Fanning or her sister, but luckily they avoided that like a Clay Aiken concert.I also want to say that for having two directors, the film is pretty seamless. Generally, two directors is a bad sign. You have competing visions, or sometimes you have one director simply picking up where the other left off. Here, it worked fine -- a feat that really can only be shared with the Coen Brothers. So, you're in good (and limited) company, gentlemen.See this movie. The Oscars it won are well-deserved, and you'll appreciate this (and maybe your family) after you see it. It's nice to see a film that isn't just raunchy humor... it may be morbid, but it's intelligently morbid.",7,0,0,1 January 2008
North by Northwest," Not My Favorite Hitchcock, But A Classic For a Reason
","A Madison Avenue advertising executive, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is mistaken for a Mr. George Kaplan and kidnapped by thugs Valerian (Adam Williams) and Licht (Robert Ellenstein). He is taken to the house of Lester Townsend on Long Island. There he is interrogated by a man he assumes to be Townsend, but who is really Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). When Thornhill repeatedly denies he is Kaplan and says he cannot cooperate, Vandamm orders his right-hand man Leonard (Martin Landau) to get rid of him.This is a classic tale of mistaken identity -- perhaps the classic tale. And it has a few twists in store, so if that mix-up wasn't enough to keep the mystery going, there's a few more surprises in store.Eva Marie Saint appears as Thornhill's partner in fake crime, in a much more outgoing role than her reserved 'On the Waterfront' persona. I like her... I can't place why, but she's a solid actress and I think underused.'North by Northwest' is considered one of the greatest films ever made and the greatest Hitchcock of all. I admit, there's plenty of great scenes and the acting is hard to beat... Cary Grant, James Mason and Martin Landau in one picture? Oh, and that climactic Mount Rushmore conflict... but I don't know. I wouldn't say it's my favorite. Maybe not even in my top three. I'm more of a murder mystery guy, I guess.Or maybe I'm just not big on Cary Grant... hmmm. A great film, to be sure... do see it. I just cannot put my full endorsement behind it in comparison to other Hitchcock, despite what all the critics say.",8,1,4,16 March 2010
Knowing," Not as Good as Ebert Says, But Good Nonetheless
","A professor of astrophysics (Nicolas Cage) stumbles upon a complex series of numbers that predicts natural disasters and even more amazingly how many people will die in them. Now he sees it as his job to save those who would perish, but is his role already factored into the equation? Can he change the future or only be a part of it? Let us start off by addressing Nic Cage's bad acting. There are exceptions, such as 'Adaptation', but generally if you want a quality acting performance you don't call upon Nicolas Cage. He somehow sells movies, often even action flicks ('National Treasure', 'Con Air', 'Face/Off'), but can be unreliable. He's like a slightly less goony Jeff Goldblum in many respects. That being said, Cage does a fine job in 'Knowing'... so maybe he's finally got a handle on his skills.Roger Ebert loved this film and gave it four stars, if the cover of the box is to be believed. I generally have a high respect for Ebert, and can usually see his points. On this occasion, I'm not completely sure I do. I haven't read the full review, which would probably explain more, but this was not a four star film. Two and a half, maybe. Despite many great things -- the acting, the general plot, the decent effects -- it is a flawed film and sort of needs patching. To put it in the 'four star' category is insulting to other films there.I loved the cinematography and think they took lessons from 'Children of Men'. One scene featuring a plane crash was very well done with the 'camera-in-tow' method and lack of cuts. I wouldn't mind seeing more of this in films, though I'm still torn on the shakiness that tends to accompany it.As I say, the film is not flawless. I don't know much about science or astrophysics, so I can't comment on the accuracy of those parts. However, I do object to the idea that determinism says everything happens for a reason. Determinism may say everything has a cause, but to say it has a 'reason' implies a meaning behind it, which is simply not true. Things may or may not have a meaning, but determinists are not all in agreement on that point. So, if that was what the film was suggesting, I disagree.I also object to the use of putting the opening credits over a still background rather than during the opening scene. To keep the pace moving and the film a shorter length, this could have been changed. Lastly, the movie crumbles in the third act -- at least for me. I can't really say why without spoiling the film, but there's a twist and turn in there that was completely unnecessary and which doesn't explain some of the plot holes as much as I would like. A second viewing may help me (it was pointed out to me after the fact how much foreshadowing there is in the first ten or fifteen minutes), but some aspects just don't add up for me.'Knowing' is an enjoyable watch, but may leave you stale. I would recommend watching it alongside 'The Screwfly Solution', as they would create an interesting contrast. Beyond that, I don't know... a good film but not the science fiction masterpiece you've been waiting for.",7,0,1,8 July 2009
Hugo," Scorsese Does a Famly Film
","In 1931, 12-year-old Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives in Paris with his father, a widowed, but kind and devoted master clockmaker. Hugo's father takes him to see films and loves those of Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s (Ben Kingsley) best of all.It is no secret that Scorsese loves film. As a director, you have to, but some just go above and beyond devouring every aspect of it. Scorsese is one of those, and this is his love letter to cinema, harking all the way back to its beginnings with Georges Melies.The cast is incredible, with Chloe Moretz, Ben Kingsley and Sacha Baron Cohen. Heck, we even have Ray Winstone and Jude Law. Quite a lineup.Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars saying 'Hugo is unlike any other film Martin Scorsese has ever made, and yet possibly the closest to his heart: a big-budget, family epic in 3-D, and in some ways, a mirror of his own life. We feel a great artist has been given command of the tools and resources he needs to make a movie about â movies.' Spot on.",8,1,2,8 December 2014
Doctor Zhivago," Hurrah for Russian Romance
","Boris Pasternak's tumultuous tale of Russia divided by war and hearts torn by love. Dr. Zhivago (Omar Sharif) and his longtime long Lara (Julie Christie) are caught up in the tidal wave of history.The film takes place just prior to and during the Russian Revolution of 1917. The Bolsheviks don't know right from wrong, says Pasha. Meanwhile, a world war is going on that alienates the common Russian because it is a war of the upper class.The film pits Zhivago against 'the Party' who have 'reformed' hospitals and stolen his property for distribution.At over three hours, including a lengthy overture, this film is 'epic' in the truest sense of the word.",7,1,3,21 April 2011
The Shining," A Horror Classic
","A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father (Jack Nicholson) into violence, while his psychic son (Danny Lloyd) sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future.What is most interesting is that this film has gone from bad to good. When it first came out, the reviews were not so positive, and there were even some Golden Raspberry nominations (but no wins). Today, this is not only considered a top horror film but one of the top 100 films of any genre... what a turnaround.Then we have King's disappointment, and I think he raises serious concerns: he did not like the casting of Nicholson, and he did not think Kubrick made the film as horror-focused as it could have been. On the first point, it is true that the lead should have had a greater transition. Nicholson just looks crazy from the first scene. I would love to have seen Michael Moriarty...As for the Kubrick criticism, it is true... he bent over backwards to make an artsy, stylish film, but maybe not a horror film. It is a great film, but maybe not a great horror film. If you want a good haunting film, for example, 'The Changeling' has this one beat...",8,3,6,30 September 2013
Warrior," A Modern Day Rocky?
","The youngest son of an alcoholic former boxer returns home, where he is trained by his father for competition in a mixed martial arts tournament - a path that puts the fighter on a collision course with his estranged, older brother.This film is necessarily compared to 'Rocky', with its underdog fighter who is moving up in the sports world. But now we have the UFC and MMA, which is today's version of boxing. (When we go get hot wings, we watch MMA. Rarely do we pay big money for boxing anymore.) Somehow this film has been praised so much it ended up on the IMDb Top 250. Exactly how is a mystery to me, though compared to other films that get on there, I suppose it is not so strange.",7,0,1,19 June 2015
Judgment at Nuremberg," Well-Crafted Courtroom Drama
","In 1948, an American court in occupied Germany tries four Nazi judges for war crimes.Never mind the all-star cast of Judy Garland, Burt Lancaster, Spencer Tracy and a surprisingly adequate William Shatner. While all of these folks did a fine job, they were overshadowed by the power of the script itself.The Nuremberg trials were an important historical event, and a fascinating event in the history of law. This film does a fine job pointing out both sides of the argument. On one side, you have people who may be guilty of atrocities because of what they did not do but could have. And on the other side, you have the argument that it is not a crime to follow orders.Indeed, the real question is why were the Germans on trial with the answer being they lost the war. One defendant says that next the Soviets will judge America. Of course, this did not happen, but could have. Was the atomic bomb justified? Was it legal? Is it legal to have a trial where the laws are written after the crimes are committed? These are big, important questions and the film tackles them excellently.",9,0,2,20 August 2012
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Best. Terminator. Movie. Ever.
","I'm not even going to bother with a real review of this film, because it has like 4000 other reviews and most people know what it is even if they haven't seen it. Sarah Conner's in an insane asylum, and a robot from the future has come to kill her son. But don't worry, because her son (in the future) sent his own robot back to kill the other robot and save the son (himself). Yeah, it might not make sense from a time travel point of view, but just deal with it.What to say? Arnold is great, as usual (though this is no 'Commando'). Edward Furlong is young, but does a fine job. I don't have the crush on him some people do, but he's cool. Robert Patrick is also awesome, even if he has creepy weird ears. And this is more action than you'll get in most films, which is probably what you want if you're watching this.There, that was my little review. Maybe next time i see the film, I'll expand it to something with substance. But for now, this is good enough... read the other reviews instead. (Yes, you can vote this to the very bottom of 'helpful' reviews.)",8,4,5,26 July 2007
Duck Soup," Dialogue-Driven Marx Brothers Film
","Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) is appointed leader of Freedonia, on the orders of Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), or she will not supply the country with any more money. But is this appointment a good idea? Firefly is a bit of a madman... and then there is the idea of a revolution...The film is not much more than a showcase of Groucho's witty remarks set in a fictitious country. Of course, that is really all you need. The other Marx brothers are pretty funny in their own right, but Groucho steals the show and could probably carry a film without them. But if you like silly more than witty, maybe you would disagree.Is it better than 'A Night at the Opera' or not? Hard to say. I think they're pretty equal: 'Opera' has a lot more plot to it, but if you just like the witty jokes, you may not care about the plot...",8,0,1,17 December 2010

Sheehan discussing The Battle of Algiers's depiction of terrorism and guerrilla warfare and directors Spike Lee, Mira Nair, Julian Schnabel, Steven Soderbergh, and Oliver Stone discussing its influence on film. This is the version you must have.The film is striking in its imagery, and while not many Americans probably know about France and Algeria, this might open their eyes a bit.

Pretty much anything from 1600-1800 is just amazing to me. And yet, this film made it seem so silly and boring. Perhaps I should not be surprised when it was made by Roland Emmerich, who does not seem able to really add any gravity to his films. (See 'Godzilla'.) The worst part is the casting of Mel Gibson. Heath Ledger is great in any part, but Gibson just looks like a thug coming down from a weekend bender. He has a few roles he has played well, but is overall forgettable. And he helped make this film forgettable.",6,2,4,3 December 2015
Edward Scissorhands," Where All the Best of Tim Burton Has Pooled Into One
","An inventor (Vincent Price) creates a man from a robot, but passes on before the being (Edward Scissorhands, played by Johnny Depp) can be completed -- he still has scissors for hands and black leather for a body. After being rescued by a door to door saleswoman, Edward finds a new home in the city. But can the villagers accept someone so different? I don't know if this is Tim Burton's best film, but it certainly is the most Burtonesque film of his, if that makes sense. We have plenty of the quirky aspects Burton likes (see 'Pee-Wee's Big Adventure') and, of course, his love of all things goth (see almost all his other films). We also have two of his favorite actors (Depp, who has appeared in countless Burton films, and Winona Ryder, from his 'Beetlejuice').Visually, this film is stunning. The houses all pastel and in a row look very odd, but make a great statement about the uniformity of communities. The inventor's shop is a perfect Rube Goldberg machine in action. The ice carving scene is beautiful, and the hedges are clipped wonderfully. The only thing in this film I found actually difficult to look at was the contrast between Winona Ryder's hair and her eyebrows. Please, Winona, stay brunette.We have comedy, romance... we have the meanest looking Anthony Michael Hall (what happened to the lovable nerd from 'Breakfast Club'?). You'll love the monster, you'll fear the monster. This modern retelling of 'Frankenstein', unlike virtually every other retelling, is actually fun for the whole family and beautiful in its own way.And, of course, we have the Danny Elfman soundtrack. I can't think of any good reason not to see this film. At least ,as long as you don't mind the really obvious bait-and-switch of dogs during the grooming scene (watch the breeds change during the snipping). Go ahead and watch this... the fewest words Johnny Depp will probably ever say in a movie, back when he had that baby face.",8,0,0,6 August 2007
Silver Linings Playbook," A Glorified Romantic Comedy
","After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) moves back in with his parents and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a mysterious girl with problems of her own.I hate to be the guy who comes along and talks bad about a film that is sitting in the IMDb Top 250 and is drowning in Oscar nominations, but I simply cannot understand the buzz around this picture. Is it funny? Yes, it is. Is it romantic? I suppose it could be. Is it enjoyable? Sure. But what does it offer for anyone who wants substance in their films? Not much.The big problem is that the film starts off having you think it will be about mental illness, or a man coping with mental illness. And for the first third of the film, that is more or less what we get. Unfortunately, by the time we are a third of the way in, Pat is mysteriously 'cured'. While he still has an obsession with reuniting with his wife, he no longer has outbursts or does erratic things and if he is bi-polar there is no way we as the audience could know.This cover story of mental illness (which would have made a good film), poorly disguises the actual plot: a romantic comedy that follows the tired, well-worn story of a man who is attracted to one woman while unknowingly falling for the woman he is with, who he foolishly thinks is only his friend. If the audience thinks, after meeting Tiffany, that Pat is going to end up with his wife rather than Tiffany, they are naive. (Heck, even that would have made a good twist, albeit a small one.) Somehow Cooper is nominated, despite not really acting after the mental illness part. He is no Michael Shannon. For most of the film, he is simply Bradley Cooper playing Bradley Cooper. Jennifer Lawrence is more deserving (she already took the Golden Globe), as she actually tries to appear unstable. And despite being a mess and with a bad sexual history, she still manages to be somewhat likable... somewhat like Holly Golightly (but not at all like Julia Roberts) perhaps? The trend of casting a female lead 16 years the male lead's junior persists, but Lawrence can play older than she is, and while this is not on the level of her performance in 'Winter's Bone', she definitely is on a winning streak.The subplot with Pat Senior (Robert DeNiro) is pretty awful. We have an old Italian-American falling into the stereotypical role of bookmaker. And who do they cast? DeNiro, who has already been typecast as the mobster. How he was nominated is beyond me, as this is even further down his slide into irrelevancy. This was more the DeNiro of 'Meet the Fockers' than 'Raging Bull', and he has to be aware that any nomination is done out of respect more than from actually earning it. When Pat Senior winds in a parlay situation where he needs to win both a football game and dance contest, we know exactly how that is going to play out... this is, after all, a fantasy world where nothing bad can happen to our protagonists, no matter how tarnished their lives may be.I know I am in the minority for opposing this film. But seriously, despite being fun and cute, what does it have going for it? It made every attempt it could to avoid any real conflict, never seriously trying to tackle family issues, mental illness, gambling addiction or anything else... an opportunity squandered.",7,13,19,21 January 2013
Van Helsing," A Guilty Pleasure, But Still a Bad Film
","Gabriel VanHelsing (an immortal, younger, less educated Abraham VanHelsing) and Kate Beckinsale must fight vampires, werewolves, Mr. Hyde, and some weird little creatures that are like Jawas with gas masks... can Hugh Jackman still kick butt when he's not Wolverine? I liked this film, but hate myself for liking it. The plot was cheesy, the CGI was overwhelmingly bad, the characters all exhibited some sort of infinite gymnastic skill and luck on landing (apparently they always roll a 20 on their balance checks) and the target audience was clearly rather young. Especially because of the CGI, this was a film I should have hated. My friend Jason says he read a review that claimed Troma could make a better film... and it was probably true.What I liked was the fact it was so over-the-top. Once or twice and I would have been 'yeah right' but doing things to the extreme fifty times made it one of those 'so bad it's good' films for me. Also, I think this is by far Kate Beckinsale's most alluring role. (I think she plays a similar character in 'Underworld', which I haven't seen, and I imagine that's comparable.) The use of the Frankenstein story was well done. The Dracula story I think was more of a stretch, and why VanHelsing had to be completely re-written from the Stoker version I don't know and don't support. So many aspects of this film reminded me of 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' with the combination of old characters and the futuristic weaponry. But, I think this film might have sucked less. Maybe.Would I watch it again? It's possible, if only to get a better second opinion now that I know what's to be expected. But it frankly was not a good film, and there's no way to convince me that it was. We have received much better from Hugh Jackman... let's do hi ma favor and pretend this one never happened.",5,3,6,1 April 2007
Monsters vs. Aliens," Fun Kid Film, Nothing Amazing
","A woman (Reese Witherspoon) transformed into a giant after she is struck by a meteorite on her wedding day becomes part of a team of monsters sent in by the U.S. government to defeat an alien mastermind trying to take over Earth.Another reviewer described this movie as 'very forgettable', which is sadly close to the truth. While not outright a bad movie, it does not offer that certain something that make many modern kid films great. It is just another movie, not a 'Toy Story' or 'Shrek'.I question some of the casting, especially Reese Witherspoon. Of all the actresses out there, Reese? I just do not see it. Although, the real question is why they hire big names actors at all. If we cannot see them, why not hire B-grade talent and save a few productions dollars?",Null,0,2,14 September 2011
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Plenty of Fun in the Mix of Horror and Action Genres
","Hansel and Gretel (Jeremy Renner and Gemma Atherton) are bounty hunters who track and kill witches all over the world. As the fabled Blood Moon approaches, the siblings encounter a new form of evil that might hold a secret to their past.Going into this, I was not expecting a good film or a bad one, but just your typical action film (albeit with a fairy tale twist). And then I noticed it was directed by Tommy Wirkola, the wonderful human being who brought the world 'Dead Snow'. My expectations and hopes went up a notch... and were fulfilled.Apparently the film has mixed reviews from critics but positive reviews from the horror community (despite not necessarily being a horror film). I can see why. What looks like an action film on the surface is just an excuse for some dark humor and endless gallons of blood.My only peeve was the use of CGI, but it was comforting to know that Wirkola fought against the CGI and used practical effects wherever possible. I wish he had gotten a few more traditional methods in there, but I suppose when you have a budget big enough you have to cater to some folks...I enthusiastically liked this film and hope the sequel is able to match its style and tone.",7,1,1,16 May 2014
Rocky IV," A Silly and Short Addition
","After iron man Drago (Dolph Lundgren), a highly intimidating 6-foot-5, 261-pound Soviet athlete, kills Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) in an exhibition match, Rocky comes to the heart of Russia for fifteen pile-driving boxing rounds of revenge.This is one of the shortest entries in the series. Cutting off the scenes added from part three, this is really only about 80 minutes. This is also the silliest up to this point; while Rocky seems a little less stupid, a robot is added to the family. A robot? Not that this is a bad movie, but it is a little light in the plot (even for a 'Rocky' film) and seems to have been made purely to cash in on Cold War fervor. Strangely, despite that, it ages rather well and now becomes a bizarre nostalgia piece.",6,2,4,13 August 2015
Dreamgirls," Very Good Musical
","A trio of black female soul singers cross over to the pop charts in the early 1960s, facing their own personal struggles along the way.Apparently this was a Broadway musical first. I never saw that, but I can see it working very well in that medium. But it also works as a view of history through the 1960s, showing how black artists had to struggle. (As one character points out, 'Hound Dog' was not a big hit until Elvis Presley took it.) There was certainly a difference between what was expected from black and white stars.This also works as sort of a build-up to the documentary '20 Feet From Stardom'. How many great singers were stuck doing nothing more than backup for other singers or bands?",7,0,0,9 July 2015
In the Name of the Father," History and Court Drama
","A man (Daniel Day-Lewis)'s coerced confession to an IRA bombing he did not commit results in the imprisonment of his father as well. An English lawyer fights to free them.This film is a great combination of history and court drama. Sometimes both mix very nicely (as with the Nuremberg trial) and sometimes they do not. Here, we get a nice glimpse at the IRA in Ireland without dwelling on it too much and also get the true story of a family that was wronged by the state for their alleged involvement in terror.Ireland today is not the same place it was a generation ago, but it is not so far removed that this story is 'distant history' and not important. Heck, Americans should probably know more about it than what they pick up from a U2 song.",8,1,1,9 April 2015
Being John Malkovich," You Were Great in That Jewel Thief Movie
","First, let's just say this was so much better than I expected -- and I already had high hopes. John Cusack? John Malkovich? What more could you want? Now, I would have been hesitant if I had known Cameron Diaz was going to show up, but she was a minor part of the film and handled herself well. One or two more good films and I might finally forgive her for 'Vanilla Sky'.The story is very absurd: a young puppeteer finds a door in his office that goes in side John Malkovich's mind. That's strange enough, but it gets so much wackier from there (but I won't ruin it for you). You have Malkovich in the primary role, who is by far one of the greatest actors in history. And you have Cusack as the secondary role, who is also a great actor - one might even say more versatile (his costume in this film makes him almost unrecognizable as Cusack).What more can I say without giving this away? First, the film is really deep (existential) but also very funny. When Cusack first tells his co-worker about the portal, she asked 'who is John Malkovich?' which I find hilarious - both because I wondered the same thing when the film first came out, and also because it begins a long string of self-deprecating Malkovich moments.The only other thing you need to know if you're not already sold: this film is a Charlie Kaufman creation. Who's Kaufman? The guy who made 'Adaptation'. And if you haven't seen that, you really ought to (I'd even say it a better film than this classic). There you go: I just suggested a double feature. Get your rump in gear and visit the video store.",8,2,3,7 August 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Steve Carell Rocks My World
","An electronics store employee is forty years old and has never made love to a woman. After his co-workers find out, they vow to find him a woman. This film follows the adventures of Andy, his exploits with loose women, and his quest to end his virginity. But will he make it? Like 'Beerfest', this film suffers from a plot that is very one-sided. The jokes are fairly repetitive since they all revolve around whether or not Andy has been with a woman yet (which is consistently not so). Some of the jokes stand out (Andy making up a time he was with a woman, the running 'I know you're gay because...' joke) but many aren't so hot. I think some of the humor relies on being at least vaguely familiar with geeky stuff.What the film has going for it is its heart. I didn't expect heart, but like 'Click' there is a positive message under the superficial exterior. My friend says to me, the film has not enough smut. She really likes smut. Well, it's true, the smut was lacking for a film about getting it on. But this might be considered a strong point since the film stressed quality of relationships, something probably important (especially for a man who is 40).Steve Carell is a funny guy, and I admire his dedication to realism. Allegedly, the chest-waxing scene is all real because Carell didn't want to cheat his audience. Thank you! This scene was one of the better ones. Paul Rudd was also funny, and the other co-stars did a fine job.A shout-out to the daughter in the film, whom I have also seen in 'London'. I feel she has a bright career ahead of her and will be a household name in five years. (Sadly, her name escapes me now... Kit something.) A decent comedy, and with no Adam Sandler, Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell, which I think is nice. No disrespect to these gentlemen, but it's time to share the stage with another man... Steve Carell (who really didn't get his full due in 'Anchorman').",7,1,2,26 December 2006
Face_Off," Nice Suit
","'Face/Off' is the tale of Shawn Archer (John Travolta) hunting down the killer of his son Michael six years after the fact. But when Travolta finally catches the killer (Nicolas Cage), he learns about a bomb that will destroy Los Angeles. The only way to find and defuse the bomb is to surgically steal the face of Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) and infiltrate his den of murderers.The effects of this film are great, first of all. Whoever designed the removed faces made them so lifelike I was quite shocked. In the same part of the film where a laser is creating a new ear for a man, I was very impressed. The explosions were also nice, though nothing you won't see in every other action film. Some things required suspended disbelief, because I find it hard to believe that Cage's character could have stolen Travolta's face, body and voice without anyone stopping him and then afterwards without Travolta's wife and kids catching on. And the fact their body types are so dissimilar. But whatever.John Travolta can't act as usual (although when he is supposed to be Cage in Travolta's body he does pretty well)... but Nicolas Cage picks up his slack. Cage in a porno mustache? Yes! Cage as a sexually deviant, dancing priest? Yes! Cage with a bomb that has a big glowing Jolly Roger on it? Yes! Cage being crazy delicious? Oh yes, yes, yes! Why is Dominique Swain wearing crimped hair? But besides that, good choice to play the teenage daughter (especially with 'Lolita' coming out the same year). I'm sure more than a few people paused or rewatched her key scenes a few times.Two cool scenes: shooting the mirrors, where each must confront themselves as the other to destroy the other as themselves. And the 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' montage... so beautifully out of place! While the ending is incredibly sick in my opinion (some would call it heartwarming), overall this delivers everything an action picture should. Maybe it needed less Travolta and more Dominique Swain, but the Cage made the bitter pill go down like a peach. Everything you are going to want from a John Yoo film.

The Men Who Stare at Goats," Clooney At His Finest, But Not Anything Special
","While doing his boring job as a reporter-journalist, one man stumbles upon the existence of an old military secret: a branch of soldiers trained in harnessing their mental superpowers. Coincidentally, after heading off to Iraq for an inside scoop on the 2003 war, he meets another member of this secret group and his misadventures begin.There's some weird obsession with 'Star Wars' in this film. Besides the obvious talk of Jedi Warriors, there's a scene early on where the main character makes a reference to blonde farm boy, which is clearly meant to be Luke Skywalker. (What's interesting is that later the guy claims to have not seen the movies, so it's odd that he would make cryptic references.)I cannot say enough about the amazing cast. Ewan MacGregor, Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges and George Clooney, among others. The most disappointing thing about this film is that with such an amazing cast that you would think this would be the year's blockbuster, but actually will more than likely be no more than a blip on the cinematic radar.I don't know what's up with Roger Ebert and his Lebowski obsession. In his review, he repeatedly says that Lebowski fans will like this one and that Jeff Bridges plays his role as Lebowski playing a military man. Well, I could see some Lebowski in there, and like that other film, they both involve Iraq. But, really, I see Lebowski when I see Jeff Bridges, so that's not really a stretch. Ebert really took it beyond the necessarily bounds.Ultimately, the film comes up short. With this cast, as I said, I expect something more. There is humor, but it's here and there. And even the plot, which is interesting, doesn't really seem to be as strong as it should be. A good film, and one I recommend to George Clooney fans, but not a hidden treasure.",6,58,93,23 December 2009
Shrek Forever After," A Pitiful Finish to a Great Trilogy
","Rumpelstiltskin tricks a mid-life crisis burdened Shrek into allowing himself to be erased from existence and cast in a dark alternate timeline where Rumpel rules supreme.This is the film that killed the series, rather than having it end on a high note with part three. Shrek is now a bored, middle-aged father and husband... everyone loves him... it could end here, but instead they use a 'alternative reality' story. Why? Just a bad idea.What is more bothersome is how this one seems to ignore the past films. Since Rumpelstiltskin and the Pied Piper both appeared in previous films, their characters should look the same, but they do not. At all. And Rumpel is voiced differently. When you lose continuity, you lose me as an audience member. (This is also the only one of the four without Prince Charming, but I think that is forgivable.) In short, not as funny, inventive, or sincere as the other three... and there is a gaping plot hole that I just feel they did nothing to rectify. (Namely, is a true love not a true love all the time?) Kids might not notice how poor this film is if they are so young they just like seeing ogres move around... but the film is so humorless that anyone over ten will be turned off by this one.",Null,1,1,7 August 2011
Dark City," The Real Matrix -- Proyas Did It First
","A man (Rufus Sewell) struggles with memories of his past, including a wife (Jennifer Connelly) he cannot remember, in a nightmarish world with no sun and run by beings with telekinetic powers who seek the souls of humans. 'Dark City' is quite possibly one of the most overlooked and under-appreciated films of the 1990s, yet could be also said to be one of the most influential. The general lack of interest in this film by critics and the general public is a mystery to me, since there is really not much to complain about with an action-packed (yet intelligent) plot, superb acting and some of the best visuals in many years. The very fact Roger Ebert called this the film of the year and took the time to record an entire audio commentary on this film is a testament to its greatness and may some day (though not yet) be looked back on as one of the seminal works of the 21st century.Directing this picture is Alex Proyas, best known for his work on 'The Crow'. The similar darkness makes his work obvious and there probably was not a better person to make this film. Tim Burton, also known for his dark films, would have been too strange. David Fincher could possibly have done it; yet, I think Proyas knew how to mix the past and the future in a dark world elegantly.Many people have made the comparison of this film with Fritz Lang's 1929 classic 'Metropolis'... and I definitely see it. The buildings / architecture in both as far as I can tell are very similar, though the plot differs sharply. 'Dark City' seems to be set in the 1940s, and that is hardly a stretch from a futuristic 1929. I saw some interesting parallels with 'Uzumaki', the Japanese horror film based on the 1998 manga. Both films feature a spiral or 'vortex' theme... 'Dark City' has one man become obsessed with spirals, filling his office and home with them; the serial killer carves spiral shapes into the flesh of his victims; and another man has a spiral fingerprint. While the symbolism is different in the two films, the visuals are strikingly similar.And even some allusions 'Hellraiser'... but only because the Strangers all look and dress exactly like Pinhead, or at least shop at the same bondage store. The 1990s were filmed with nihilistic films, and the costumes here reflect that sensibility. But most of all, this film is similar to 'The Matrix' in a great multitude of ways -- and this film came first, which really undercuts 'The Matrix'. One man comes to realize the world he lives in is not all it seems -- other beings, more powerful than humans, control the real universe behind the scenes. He is brought to realize this by someone who goes between both worlds, but is not powerful enough to stop them on his own. In time, this man acquires the powers of those he is up against. Both are compared to Jesus Christ -- John Murdoch's apartment number is 614, in the Bible, John 6:14 says 'Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.' And on top of this, some of the same sets were used for both movies. So 'The Matrix' is half the genius film some have made it out to be.Have I applauded the cast? Kiefer Sutherland, a great cult actor ('Lost Boys'). Richard O'Brien, another great cult actor ('Rocky Horror Picture Show'). And Jennifer Connelly, who is the greatest actress in the history of the universe on both this planet and on all other planets, both in this dimension and in every possible dimension. To create a dimension where Jennifer Connelly is not perfect would be impossible and against the will of God Himself. William Hurt is in this film, and you cannot deny the star power of Bill Hurt. While his character is somewhat one-dimensional in this film and does not have the range Hurt is capable of, he nonetheless filled this role with as much vivaciousness as possible. I really hoped his character, a detective, would solve the case.And the questions this film raises about love (can it be synthetic) and our memories (could we be living a false life, created by a higher power)... maybe not every day problems, but something much deeper and hard to think about without a headache. The film reminds me of Professor Daniel Putman, who would constantly challenge us to prove the universe was not created five minutes prior. (Putman, of course, was evoking Bertrand Russell's Last Thursdayism.)This film has some flaws (is Murdoch too powerful? how is a speeding taxi slower than a police officer on foot?) but is overall a priceless film. Highest possible recommendation.",9,1,4,24 February 2006
The Machinist," The Ultimate Mood Experience of Grit
","After not sleeping for an entire year, a machinist named Trevor (Christian Bale) begins having encounters with a strange man named Ivan. Ivan's presence causes him increasing trouble with his girlfriend and his employer, and as life unravels he is less and less sure what's real and what's not. Throw in a game of Hangman and a bleeding refrigerator and the story gets even more strange.'The Machinist' has been called a mood piece, and I think this is a perfect description. The writer's love of Nine Inch Nails, mixed with director Brad Anderson's unique psychological themes (see his 'Session 9' if you haven't)... and throw in references and parallels to the works of Dostoevsky... this film is deep, complex and edgy. Fans of 'Seven' or 'Fight Club' or '8MM' will love this one.Great supporting actors Jennifer Jason Leigh and Michael Ironside are here, but no one can deny the amazing work of Christian Bale. Bale gives his all when playing a role (whether as Patrick Bateman or Batman or any other number of roles), but it might be 'The Machinist' where he gave his most extreme. Losing many pounds to play the role -- without even requested to by the director -- he became a sickly thin man living off of tuna and cigarettes. That's dedication.I don't know what more to say... deep psychological thriller, lots of subtle clues along the way... prostitution... this is just a dark tale. Well, more dirty than dark, but dark in its own way. I strongly suggest that anyone who hasn't seen this film make it a priority to get this one on their viewing list.",8,0,1,3 August 2009
The Intouchables," A French Look At Race And Class
","After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, an aristocrat (FranÃ§ois Cluzet) hires a young man from the projects (Omar Sy) to be his caretaker.The Independent called it a 'a third-rate buddy movie that hardly understands its own condescension....Why has the world flipped for this movie? Maybe it's the fantasy it spins on racial/social/cultural mores, much as Driving Miss Daisy did 20-odd years ago â uptight rich white employer learns to love through black employee's life-force. That was set in the segregationist America of the 1940s. What's this film's excuse?' While 'the Independent' is right to call out the film's unrealistic portrayals of race and class, perhaps it somewhat misses the point. This film is obviously humorous, clearly not based on reality, and is probably not meant to be taken seriously. The movie has very much the same spirit as 'The Birdcage' (at least the American version, if not the French one).Now, this means the film also happens to be overrated, currently (November 2014) sitting high on IMDb's Top 250. A good comedy, yes, but not a film that offers any sort of deeper meaning or one that will remain important over the long term. While popular and a box office record holder, this is not a title one expects to be considered a 'classic' later on.",7,0,2,11 November 2014
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Black Could Be Anywhere
","It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts; not only does he have a new 'Defense Against the Dark Arts' teacher, but there is also trouble brewing. Convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizards' Prison and is coming after Harry. Of the first three Harry Potter films, this is by far my favorite. The atmosphere shifts to a darker place, which may be partly due to the story and partly due to the new director. Besides the darker images, I like the characters introduced here -- Professor Lupin, the best Defense Against the Dark Arts professor thus far, and Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who is my favorite character in the entire series. We also have the Hippogriff, which is a fantastic creature, and Doby the house elf. And a time travel element that plays out just as effectively -- and with more sense -- than 'Timecrimes'.Harry Potter purists may have some complaints here. Hermione now has normal girl hair rather than the wild, frizzy hair, making her less of an outcast that she may be supposed to be. And they spend very, very little time in their school uniforms. Of course, they are more often outside of the school grounds, so that explains itself. I was curious why Ginny never appears even once. Perhaps she does not appear in the book, but at this point she should be becoming a more important character.There is a line in the film that really stands out: 'Black could be anywhere.' I do not wish to dwell on this, but I cannot help but wonder if this is some sort of inside joke...",8,0,1,2 May 2011
Ratatouille," Decent Pixar
","A rat who can cook makes an unusual alliance with a young kitchen worker at a famous restaurant.This film is given high praise, and many seem to think it is among Pixar's best work. That seems a tad overblown. While the film is certainly good, it does not seem to go above and beyond anything else the studio has done. The animation (again, good) is no better than anything else they have released.Even the message is the same old story: someone (or thing) from one group wants to be in another. His current group says no, the new one is hesitant, but he has to be himself. Now, that is a good message, and this may be an extreme example (rats in a kitchen a la 'Muppets Take Manhattan') but it is still nothing new.",7,0,0,10 December 2014
The Lego Movie," Starts Strong But Is Ultimately Disappointing
","An ordinary Lego construction worker (Chris Pratt), thought to be the prophesied 'Special', is recruited to join a quest to stop an evil tyrant (Will Farrell) from gluing the Lego universe into eternal stasis.As much as I dislike posting reviews with spoilers, this will have to be one in order to justify my lower rating. For the most part, until 66% or maybe even 75% of the movie, I really thought this was one of the best animated features I had ever seen. It looks great, the story is good (even if the message is a bit lame and blunt), and there are some genuinely funny moments with old characters in new situations (Lando and Batman, for example).But here is where they lost me: the introduction of human, live action characters. When the already obvious message of being against conformity and growing up suddenly gets even more obvious by showing the interaction of father and son, it loses me. Why do we have to go there? And why do we have to have the Lego universe exist in a kid's imagination and not some real place?",7,6,11,17 November 2014
Aliens," A Sequel Worthy of the Original
","Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) returns to her base, only to find she's been asleep for many decades, and her daughter is now dead. She tells the story of the alien, is not believed, but is called into service again once the aliens she spoke of coincidentally become known. (We might ask how they are found almost exactly the same time she notifies them of the aliens rather than years prior or years later, but let's not get picky.) There are now more aliens, including a swarm of full-sized ones (not just the single one from 'Alien'). And the queen! Holy cow! And, of course, they have to go deep into the hive to stop the aliens from hurting the colonists (although, in all fairness, I think the aliens were there first).How often does a sequel really compare to the original? Other than with 'The Godfather Part Two', I can only think of one example: 'Aliens'. The general idea is the same as the first film: group of stranded space explorers attacked by aliens must survive. The difference: more aliens, better cast and better technology (using forklifts to kill aliens is awesome).I have to give a shout-out to Carrie Henn, who played the young Rebecca 'Newt' Jorden. She was amazing, and I really wish she would have continued acting. I hear she's now 31 and teaching in California or something, having never made another film. This is too bad, as she really tied the picture together. I don't know if Ripley needed a daughter figure to replace her dead daughter (this seems very contrived), but it worked.Lance Henriksen appears as Bishop, probably his best role. In the future, Henriksen sells out and appears in every straight-to-video horror film he can get a part in, but back in 1986 this was a break-through role for him. Forget Data from 'Star Trek' (as cool as Brent Spiner is), Lance Henriksen's Bishop is king. Bill Paxton is also great as Private Hudson, with the immortal 'Game over, man' line. Maybe not Paxton's best role (he's also great in 'Weird Science' and 'Twister', you know) and he is a bit whiny at times, but he's a welcome addition to the cast.As for Paul Reiser, forget that guy. He's only good for co-starring alongside ugly women (here and in 'mad About You'). His character of Carter Burke is so typical of lawyers. I prefer the lawyer from 'Jurassic Park'. But hey, that's just me. At least it's not Billy Crystal.There is an 'illegal alien' joke i found in poor taste, not because I was offended, but because I assume that in the future the concept of 'illegal alien' will have no more meaning.Overall, just as good as the first. It runs a bit long with the director's cut (two hours and thirty-seven minutes) but was really enjoyable. The guy I watched it with -- Brandon -- was ready to rent 'Alien 3', but Family Video doesn't carry it. What a scam, eh? But anyway, check this one out -- you know coming from James Cameron ('The Abyss', 'Terminator II') it has to be good. Only Cameron could have succeeded Ridley Scott (and bring Michael Biehn with him), and he does it well.",9,1,2,28 August 2007
Dallas Buyers Club," Best Film of 2013
","In 1985 Dallas, electrician and hustler Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) works around the system to help AIDS patients get the medication they need after he is himself diagnosed with the disease.While '12 Years a Slave' is likely the winner of Academy Award for Best Picture, this review will make the case for 'Dallas Buyers Club'. Personally, this is the stronger film and the more important film.We all know that Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto gave the best performances of their respective careers here. The extreme weight loss (and health damage it caused) is enough to deserve an award, but then to go on and give powerful performances is just amazing. Leto is more than convincing as Rayon, a pre-op transsexual woman. If he does not win, something is wrong with the world.Matthew McConaughey has only risen over the years, going from cult movies ('Dazed and Confused', 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next generation') to romantic comedies ('Failure to Launch' among others). He has now gone on to repeated success with 'Killer Joe', 'Mud' and this film (not to mention his brief part in 'Wolf of Wall Street'). His acting may continue to be honed, but will he ever surpass this role? I think not, and for that reason he needs the award.Back to the film as a whole. While '12 Years a Slave' deals with the historically emotional subject of slavery, 'Dallas Buyers Club' brings us a far more hard-hitting story. The 1980s are not so long ago that we cannot remember them, but are just far enough ago that relatively few to practically none of the people suffering from AIDS at the time are still with us today. Only a few decades later, HIV infection does not have to be the end of the world, and this film shows the turning point in that battle.Further, there is the interesting distinction that Woodroof made between 'not approved' and 'illegal'. This makes for a brilliant plot point -- what he was doing was not importing illegal drugs, but merely ones that were not granted a seal of approval from the government yet. Whether that makes such medication illegal or not is fascinating -- and then the loophole of selling memberships rather than selling drugs... brilliant again! The film is both emotional and highly intelligent.Parallels have probably been drawn -- with or without success -- to today's issues of marijuana legalization, FDA approval of current drugs, or the health care system as a whole. But this is not necessary for the film to be meaningful and enjoyable.The only issue I had was Woodroof's transformation from a bigot to someone who at least tolerates homosexuality, if not fully accepts it. He seems to transition much quickly than one might expect. Allegedly, the real life Woodroof was not anti-gay and may even have been bisexual. That would have worked well, or at least toning the bigotry down in the early scenes. Getting from A to B in two hours is plausible, but A to C or D? Not gonna happen.",9,1,1,23 February 2014
The Fast and the Furious," Somehow Created a Series
","Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) must decide where his loyalty really lies when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.As of now (2016), I cannot even keep track of how many films there are in this series. At least eight, maybe nine, and that's not counting the original version which has almost nothing to do with this one. How this movie spawned a whole industry is beyond me.Not that it is a bad movie, but it really has no depth at all. A guy races cars, and everyone else races cars, and the guy is attracted to another guy's sister. It all falls into place so easily, no hassle, no time to find out who anyone is. And yet, this is the movie that made Paul Walker immortal.",6,0,10,23 August 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Decent For Comic Fans
","The X-Men send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants.There is plenty to enjoy about this film, but I think it has one shortcoming: without a knowledge of the comic, a viewer might be a little confused. The sheer number of mutants (and other characters) is a tad overwhelming. Of course, some of this is helped if you saw previous X-Men films (as you should), but it is still quite a large amount.What is very interesting is how Quicksilver appears here, and is also in the 'Avengers'. And these two films do not share the same universe. I am a bit unsure how the rights worked out, but somehow they must have found the character to be acceptable in both worlds. Still odd having him in two movies at once.",7,0,0,6 July 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Too Much CG Spioils An Otherwise Good Film
","Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.I see some people calling this the best Marvel film yet, and right now it sits at a 7.9 on IMDb. I would have to respectfully disagree with these champions of the film. While I do think it is a decent plot, and does a fine job of showing the philosophical differences between Iron Man and Captain America, it has two big issues for me.One, it is far too dependent on CGI. I would rather see more physical effects, even if they might be less 'spectacular'. Frankly, I am not impressed by the CGI because any time something happens action-wise, it becomes very obvious the characters are drawn in and not played by actors. I understand that action is important to a superhero movie, but why must it be the worst-looking part? And two, while the plot does do something for character development, it really has very little to offer as far as a story. The characters seem to have very little growth. My impression is the whole point of the film was merely to set up Spider-Man and Black Panther for their own films. It definitely didn't do much for anyone else.",7,1,4,13 February 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Great Moments, Sme Disappointment
","The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school.There is plenty to like here. Eddie Redmayne is great (as always), and Dan Fogler is quite a treat. The time the film is set in is interesting. And some things (like the Niffler) are cute and somewhat amusing.The film does rely far too much on CGI creatures, which I suppose is understandable given the source material. Another reviewer said the first half of the film is like 'going to the zoo', which is fairly accurate. Also, I thought the two child actors were pretty awful. Credence, who is a central part of the story, is just awful... really ruined the whole film. The albino girl was no better.",6,0,1,4 June 2017
Gandhi," Ben Kingsley, One of the All-Time Greats
","Biography of Mohandas K. Gandhi (Ben Kingsley), the lawyer who became the famed leader of the Indian revolts against the British rule through his philosophy of nonviolent protest.The cast is pretty amazing: Martin Sheen, Candice Bergen, Daniel Day-Lewis. But Ben Kingsley, of course, steals the show. Unfortunately, it seems he has not maintained the same level of respect since this performance. In everything from 'Schindler's List' to 'Iron Man 3' he has shown incredible range, but does not seem to be the A-lister he ought to be.The film is something of an epic in the vein of David Lean, reminding viewers of 'Lawrence of Arabia'. This is the rise of a national hero. Now, it could be criticized for portraying Gandhi in too positive a light (he had negative qualities, too) but when the film is done this well, it is hard to complain.",8,2,3,5 December 2014
American History X," What Happens When People Stop Being Polite And Be Real?
","American History X is the tale of a skinhead (Edward Norton) who 'curb stomps' a black man and goes to prison. Whiel in prison, he reflects on his younger days and learns that racism is stupid. But when he gets back out, can he save his brother (Edward Furlong), who has followed in his footsteps? Also stars Fairuza Balk, Avery Brooks and the dad from 'Boy Meets World'.This is a very powerful movie because of one thing: its rawness. Raw is the only word I know that describes the intensity of the violence and the prison situations. You won't find this on 'The Birdman of Alcatraz' (though maybe on 'Oz').Also, the movie tackles a real world issue: racism. Unfortunately, it does so in a very exaggerated way (not all racists are skinheads), drags in things like affirmative action (which is racial but not necessarily racist or anti-racist) and seems to focus on blacks. In the world of 1998 maybe blacks were heavily discriminated against, but by 2006 it seems that being black is not nearly as bad as being Hispanic or Arab. (Not that blacks are equal yet, but much more so than other groups.) We all know Edward Norton is a great actor ('Fight Club') and many will rave over Edward Furlong ('Brainscan'). Avery Brooks tries hard to break away from the Star Trek stereotype (but fails). Fairuza Balk is great (at least as good as 'The Craft', much better than 'The Waterboy' but not as good as 'Return to Oz'). The dad from 'Boy Meets World'? Don't know his name... he's the dad from 'Boy Meets World'.A great film, but don't watch it with your kids unless they're old enough to understand adult situations. This is 'Schindler's List' for Americans. Could be a great way to start a discussion on a difficult issue.",9,2,3,2 October 2006
Saw III," Not Mind-Blowing, But Quite Good By Sequel Standards
","Jigsaw and Amanda kidnap a doctor to keep Jigsaw alive while a man who lost his son to a drunk driver must survive a handful of tests.This film was not the greatest horror film I've seen. It certainly didn't leave me the way 'Saw' left me. But as the third film in the series, hastily written, it was actually pretty good. The traps were decent (though less creative than before) and the story takes an interesting new direction. Best of all, flashbacks that help fill in the gaps from the first two films (many of us figured out how Jigsaw remained motionless so long in the first film, but now it's no longer a debate).Some critics said the film had gadgets that were too high-tech or too reliant on medical knowledge. I disagree. They showed how devoted Amanda was and I find it plausible she spent countless hours perfecting the devices and studying anatomy (one scene makes it clear she has a solid knowledge of pharmaceuticals).Others have said the film was gory. I say it was not gory enough! For me, the most disturbing scene was in the first five minutes. Later scenes that could have been incredibly bloody (a woman's rib cage being pulled forcibly open, for example) took the camera off the action or made the scene too dark to really enjoy. The generation of horror fans today grew up with Mortal Kombat... they can handle body parts getting ripped off. Give them what they want. (Not to mention the growing influence of Asian horror film gross-outs like 'Imprint'.)The pigs in the grinder... delightfully perfect.I also thought the plot was incredibly contingent. For it to work out perfectly, everything would have to happen exactly as it did with the right people living and dying and certain people being out of their homes long enough to rig things. (The Mysties are saying 'it's just a show, you should really just relax' and they're right... but it saddens me to see such intelligent film makers leave these danglers.)I'm not sure why the father of the drunk driver was targeted. Unlike past victims, his 'crime' (wanting revenge on his son's killer) wasn't even really that bad. Very natural, in fact.The visuals as usual are good, and the film is both dark and filmed through a blue tint to give a more sterile feel. Sterile as in isolated. I feel there's so much more to say, but I'm drawing a blank. But really, if you liked the first two films you have no excuse to miss this one. It really clamps down the series.",7,0,3,3 November 2006
Spirited Away," Great Story, Maybe Not the Finest Animation
","In the middle of her family's move to the suburbs, a sullen 10-year-old girl wanders into a world ruled by gods, witches, and monsters; where humans are changed into animals; and a bathhouse for these creatures.This film regularly makes Top Ten lists, whether films for children, best animation, or even within IMDb's Top 250. And sure, it is a great story, with far more depth than the average children's cartoon. So if we are judging on writing, this cartoon is tops.But its overall presentation is somewhat different. This is not the greatest artwork, innovation or style out there. In many ways it is no improvement on many 1980s and 1990s cartoons. Why was this the Oscar-winning cartoon of its year, and why does it continue to be such a huge influence? At least the American version has John Ratzenberger.",7,1,5,10 November 2014
Underground," Yugoslavia at its Strangest
","The story follows an underground weapons manufacturer in Belgrade during WWII and evolves into fairly surreal situations. A black marketeer who smuggles the weapons to partisans doesn't mention to the workers that the war is over, and they keep producing. Years later, they break out of their underground 'shelter' --- only to convince themselves that the war is still going on.I know very little about Yugoslavian film, or Serbian film or any other film industry of the region. But this is some great satire here, with the sensibility of Luis Bunuel or those fine folks who made 'Delicatessen' and 'Amelie' (drawing a blank on their names, sorry). Who knew that war could be funny? This is the sort of war comedy that 'Life is Beautiful' could only dream of being.",8,2,4,5 June 2015
Hardball," Not Awful
","An aimless young man (Keanu Reeves) who is scalping tickets, gambling and drinking, agrees to coach a Little League team from the Cabrini Green housing project in Chicago as a condition of getting a loan from a friend.Keanu Reeves's performance in 'Hardball' earned him a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actor (also for 'Sweet November'), but he lost the award to Tom Green for 'Freddy Got Fingered'. Interestingly, I see 'Freddy' as a misunderstood masterpiece... and hardly think Reeves is bad in 'Hardball' (whereas 'Sweet November' is just a bad movie).One could complain that this film has the 'white savior' problem, with a white man saving the lives (figuratively) of an all-black team. I did not have that issue. There are some familiar plot devices, but all in all it is an enjoyable movie... one that maybe should be re-examined.",6,1,1,23 December 2015
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Excellent Film, But Over-hyped
","What to say, what to say? I had heard good things about this film for a while, an recently those good things reached a crescendo, with two of my most trusted movie advisers both recommending it. And, I am sad to say, as good as it was, it just did not meet the hype. Primarily because it was too long.You have the dorkiest man in Hollywood, Michael Cera, and another arch-dork, Jason Schwartzman. And you have a female lead who I consider one of the top five hottest women in the world, Mary Elizabeth Winstead. So that is a great cast, not including all the bonus guest stars. (Sadly, I should be clear, Winstead did not look attractive at all in this film, being shown up by Ellen Wong.) Another reviewer says the film is 'quite possibly the most original and fresh movie of the decade.' That is a bit extreme, but not without merit. I would be hard-pressed to find another movie similar to it. There are some 'Kill Bill' moments, but the first is clearly more inspired by Beck, Nintendo (with some obscure references, such as Clash at Demonhead) and the original graphic novel.The same reviewer says the film is 'not a perfect movie and hardly could be called a masterpiece.' I think this is true on a film levels. While the film clearly has great visuals and a sense of humor I appreciate, it spends too little time on character development and runs on the long side by having 7 evil exes. 5 would have been enough, and kept the pace more smooth. The fight scenes started to get repetitive.The reviewer claims this is 'the ultimate love story: a guy fights an army for his loved one.' And that is a valid point, except I disagree. Scott Pilgrim hardly ever gets to know Ramona Flowers (again, little character development) beyond the fact she had seven exes... she is not worth that much trouble. And then you have his other love, whose only flaw is that she is in high school. They seem a better match.I would love to respond to Roger Ebert's review, but he did not write one. (Apparently, he was writing his memoirs at the time.) Some have tried to find a deeper meaning in the film, some criticism of pop culture. I do not know about that. Anyway: great film, full of nostalgia, and a really good concept. But runs on the long side, and if the fight scenes had been shortened to expand the characters a bit, it would have been an even better movie... as it is, a guilty pleasure but probably not a long-lasting film.",7,2,7,6 February 2011
Inside Out," A Strong, Emotional Film From Pixar
","After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions -- Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness -- conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.As with many popular, successful movies, this one has caused a great deal of response on the Internet. Many people love it, and it currently (January 2016) sits in the Top 100 on IMDb. And, of course, we begin to get a push back with people calling it overrated, over-hyped, and some even saying it is offensive in its depiction of gender and inappropriate for children.The path it has followed through award season has had a similar up and down trajectory. Early on, it was seen as the clear winner of the animation Oscar and even in the running for Best Picture. Gradually slipping, it now seems to be 50/50 for animation (up against 'Anomalisa') with zero chance of getting anywhere near Best Picture. Sorry, Pixar.As with anything, the reality is never as rosy or as bleak as the Internet would like it to be. 'Inside Out' may not be Best Picture, but it has a better-than-average chance of landing the animation Oscar. And that is because you rarely get a cartoon that reaches this deep inside its audience. A film about emotions (or lack thereof) that actually makes you feel.This is not a children's movie. The kids will enjoy the bright colors and characters, especially Bing Bong. And there is nothing 'adult' in terms of violence, nudity or cursing. (There is one subtle reference to the San Francisco homosexual community, but it is not offensive or derogatory.) This may be the darkest Pixar film yet, thematically. Depression, loneliness, alienation. The adults are the ones who will really appreciate this sad story of change and end of innocence.Director Pete Docter, who previously made 'Up', has set the bar high for himself here if he continues making movies (which, of course, he will). He could even have achieved for himself a place alongside John Lasseter in the hall of great animation directors. He assembled this one just right, down to the voices -- Lewis Black and Phyllis Smith are the very embodiment of the emotions they portray.Although the best animation in recent years remains 'Wreck-It Ralph', this film clearly has to rank among the finest, giving such movies as 'Ralph' and 'Toy Story 3' a run for their money.",7,5,29,3 January 2016
Dirty Dancing," Very Memorable Film, Timeless
","In the 1960s, during a family summer getaway, Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Grey) meets dancer Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) and falls hard for him... with his bad reputation and her father (Jerry Orbach) being a reputable doctor, what will become of this relationship? 'Dirty Dancing' is one of the quintessential films of the 1980s. If you grew up in the 80s, you probably saw this film a dozen times. I know I did. I recall seeing it again and again in the summer of 1992, and have returned to it many times since.Patrick Swayze should not be underestimated, and this is one of the cornerstones of his career (along with 'Ghost' and 'Road House'). And Jennifer Grey is 1980s through and through -- aside from this and 'Feris Bueller', what can you say for her? But the film has charm, is very quotable, and despite delving into some questionable territory (both ethical and political questions are hinted at) it is at its heart a family values film: daughter growing up and a father who loves and supports her maturity and independence.",7,0,0,28 July 2010
Quantum of Solace," Comes Up Short
","James Bond (Daniel Craig) descends into mystery as he tries to stop a mysterious organization from eliminating a country's most valuable resource.Although it would be wrong to say I am a big James Bond fan to begin with, I had seen every film up to this point, which is no small commitment. Daniel Craig does a fine job, incidentally. I don't know that he has an iconic look the way Connery or Brosnan did, but he probably is not the worst man ever to play Bond.For me, the flaws in this film can be summed up as direction or cinematography. The story is interesting, the characters and acting are fine. However, the action scenes look really cheap and the computer effects are awful. Why this was allowed to happen, I don't know, but these are probably the worst action scenes in the whole series (though I have not yet seen 'Spectre').",5,0,3,5 September 2017
The Dirty Dozen," This is What Happens When You let Criminals Fight Nazis
","A dangerous mission to infiltrate the Nazis has been planned. It means certain death. Who better to recruit than prisoners who have already been sentenced to death (or at least hard labor) for murder, rape and theft? These twelve men will become the Dirty Dozen.The cast here is amazing. Lee Marvin, Telly Savalas as the psychotically religious Archer Maggott, Donald Sutherland as Vernon Pinkley, and even an early uncredited appearance by Dick Miller. Savalas really steals the show with his uncontrollable behavior. Can he denounce the army for its immorality but yet be commanded by God to rape? He thinks so.I found the film a bit unbalanced, with more focus on recruiting and training than the actual operation. I could have used more Nazi bashing. ('Inglorious Basterds' has a similar theme about men recruited to infiltrate the Nazis, though they are generally not criminals -- but the focus there is more on the fighting, which pays off.) The recruitment is good, and the training is fine (establishing their 'dirty dozen' name), I just think the divisions were slightly off.A fine film, just the same. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who likes World War II flicks, or criminal rehabilitation, or Lee Marvin... or Telly Savalas. Really, it's a pretty great film.",8,0,1,30 March 2010
No Country for Old Men," Fate, Chance and Unstoppable Evil
","A sheriff in West Texas stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong. He is left hunting an innocent man who has taken the money from the deal (two million dollars) and the hit-man who killed the dealers and is trying his best to kill the man with the money. Throw in gun fights, secret stashes and border-crossing and you've got yourself the Coen Brothers' best film in years.What makes this film great (aside from the gorgeous cinematography) is also what makes it confusing for many people. The film is a bait and switch: we think we are watching a film about shoot-outs and men trying to escape the law with the loot (the same as any other Western or gangster story out there). And, to some degree, we are. But more importantly we are being told a lesson about fate and chance: we can live or die in any instance, either because we are destined to do so or merely by chance. While it's not common to accept both possibilities, this film makes a convincing case.The Coen Brothers love having the 'unstoppable evil' character. Take, for example, John Goodman in 'Barton Fink'. And they definitely deliver with the hit-man Chigurh (who also carries the burden of fate and chance with him). Many great scenes exist in this film, but one that stood out the most for me was early in the film when Chigurh confronts a gas station attendant. I don't know if even a knife could cut that tension. The suspense was strong, and I was literally on the edge of my seat (which happens to be a futon in this case).This film is tied with 'There Will Be Blood' for most Oscar nominations in 2007 (and at the time of this writing has not yet been judged). The tally is eight, and I can't agree more with this. 2007 was a good year for films (I also loved 'Juno') and this ranks as one of the best, if not the very best. Even if you don't 'get it' (I didn't at first and maybe still don't fully), you'll like this movie. Tommy Lee Jones, playing a cop for the 100th time, has perfected it. And Josh Brolin comes hot off of 'Planet Terror' to show us he's ready to be a headliner. Show him some support.",9,5,12,19 February 2008
District 9," A Nice Analogy About Racism and Oppression
","An alien mothership hovers over South Africa, and millions of aliens, starving and weak, spill out. They are put into camps in District 9, a section of shacks that is poor and largely run by gang members. Weapons and food get traded on the black market. What is to be done? As I type this (January 2010), this film is ranked #102 of all time. It's a fine film, but really? Almost top 100 of all time? That seems a little fishy to me, and I suspect if I ever revise this review, it will drop to 200 or lower.Writer and director Neill Blomkamp has taken some good science fiction -- aliens, genetic manipulation, advanced weaponry -- and combined it with a subtle, or maybe not so subtle, message about racism and South African apartheid. While there is clearly a difference between aliens and people, is it that much different from the divide amongst races? After all, the prawns in this film clearly operate on at least our level.The apartheid analogy gets a bit muddled with the genetic aspect... I don't see white South Africans turning black, especially after ingesting fuel. But it's a story, and a well-written one at that, with no predecessors that come to mind. Blomkamp has really unleashed a unique piece of film here. Thank you, Peter Jackson, for producing this one.If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do. Science fiction fans will obviously enjoy it, but it goes beyond that. One friend of mine, who I would not suspect is a sci-fi fan, really loved it for the message of family. Even aliens have families in District 9. I would gladly watch this one again, though I'm still confused about the interspecies prostitution.",7,3,5,4 January 2010
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," An Epic of American History
","Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), who has idolized Jesse James (Brad Pitt) since childhood, tries hard to join the reforming gang of the Missouri outlaw, but gradually becomes resentful of the bandit leader.This film is a masterpiece of cinematographer Roger Deakins. Sure, Brad Pitt is hailed as a great actor (and he personally loves his work in it). And you have to credit the director, who made one of the most amazing cuts ever (around four hours). But this is Deakins.Getting the right look for a period film is a challenge. Part of it is the costumes and part of it is the language, but I think much of the job falls on the cinematographer to get the right colors, lighting and angles. And this was a success.",8,1,2,8 August 2013
Batman Begins," Batman Begins Again - This Time With a Vengeance
","Anything I say about this film will sell it short. I was originally skeptical when I saw the Urban Assault Vehicle in the trailer, but my fears were calmed when I saw it in context. Everything about this film is perfect - the acting, the directing, the mood, the plot, and all else. It is rare to see such intricate storytelling mixed with bone-shattering intensity in the action department. And fans of the comic will not be disappointed with this apt translation.I hope Chris Nolan directs all future Bat-movies, because his lighting and architectural canvasing was so perfect, it outdid Tim Burton's interpretation (which I previously thought impossible). As of this review, IMDb has rated the movie #117 of all time, and I agree completely. This film has universal appeal. Christian Bale is perfect as Bruce Wayne, Katie Holmes actually acts for once in her career, Liam Neeson is the quintessential villain. Other stars shine brightly. I can only hope that Crispin Glover becomes the Joker in the sequel. Highest possible recommendation...",9,1,2,10 September 2005
Wreck-It Ralph," Best Animated Feature of 2012?
","A video game villain (John C. Reilly) wants to be a hero and sets out to fulfill his dream, but his quest brings havoc to the whole arcade where he lives.I am going to go out on a limb here and say this was the best animated feature of 2012. While I enjoyed 'Frankenweenie' and 'ParaNorman' and think 'Pirates' is deserving of recognition, this film just won my heart. I have not seen 'Brave' yet, but have my doubts that it can compete on this level.The story is automatically a winner, as it has a bad guy -- who is bad through no fault of his own -- trying to be good. That is a great concept, and could raise interesting moral questions (which I will not do here). But they went the extra mile here and actually included real video games characters -- how they were able to get the rights is beyond me, but they did. And they threw in video game humor which was not necessary for the film to be a success, but will make various fans smile and nod (the 'World of Warcraft' reference is over my head, but I liked the 'Zero Wing' and 'Portal' jokes).What makes the animation here special, perhaps more special than other cartoons, is that they had to incorporate so many styles and create mini worlds. From the 8-bit world of Ralph, to the first-person shooter to the elaborate Candy Rush... this must have taken some time and more than a small share of creativity. If a game has not already been developed based on this film, it seems only natural -- the groundwork has already been done.Does Vanellope von Schweetz count as a Disney princess? Probably not -- but I think she should.",9,1,1,3 February 2013
Bridesmaids," Surprise Comedy Hit of the Year?
","Competition between the maid of honor and a bridesmaid, over who is the bride's best friend, threatens to upend the life of an out-of-work pastry chef.I hate to say this, but I laughed many times watching this film. I had some pretty low expectations, thinking it would be a 'chick flick'. It could not have been farther from that. This was totally a Judd Apatow film.Women with the mile high club? Food poisoning leading to using the sink as a toilet? Oh my! An bonus points for being set in Wisconsin, although I can tell you that living here for 30 years that our state does not look anything like what you see in this movie.",7,3,6,8 December 2011
Meet the Fockers," More Ben Stiller Comedy... I Know I've Had My Fill
","Gaylord Focker and Pam Byrnes are ready to be married, but first they think their parents ought to meet. Picking up where the first film left off, we now have another set of parents just as quirky as the first, giving us double the insanity. For fans of the first film, this should be a treat! For me, I'm getting my fill of Ben Stiller. He doesn't seem to really have a lot of range and his style isn't so amazing. What's the last great film he had? I loved 'Dodgeball' and his cameos are always nice ('Happy Gilmore', for example) but he seems to play the same guy over and over (Gaylord Focker really isn't much different from the Ben Stiller in 'There's Something About Mary').Also, this film relies almost entirely on potty humor. Some people will really be happy about the humor, whereas I prefer a more witty and sarcastic film. Cats flushing toilets, sexual elderly people, fake breasts. Not my sort of thing, really.The film was a good pace, so it was easily watchable even if it wasn't my style. And the addition of Dustin Hoffman to the cast was great. Robert DeNiro really runs the plot (I think he overshadows Stiller on many occasions), but Dustin Hoffman is the gem here. (In a recent review for 'Stranger Than Fiction', I say much the same thing. But it's true -- Hoffman has a subtlety about him where he blends perfectly into his roles and seems more lifelike than the rest of the cast.) Barbara Streisand was also nice, which is odd because she's Barbra Streisand. The rest of the cast was unremarkable (though I must give credit to the casting director or whoever found the Jorge character... great job).If you're into Ben Stiller and/or 'Meet The Parents', you'll get something out of this. If you're like me, you probably won't. I watched it because I was visiting my father, otherwise it would never have been on my screen. And I can safely say having seen it I wouldn't have been missing out.",6,0,0,28 March 2007
Before Sunset," Linklater Sharpens His Pencil
","Nine years after Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) first met, they encounter each other again on the French leg of Jesse's book tour.Years before the critical acclaim of 'Boyhood' or the cult status of 'Dazed and Confused', Richard Linklater caught our attention with 'Slacker', essentially a film of nothing more than a series of folks discussing a series of bizarre theories (and Madonna's pap smear).Then, Linklater took that concept and matured it. By replacing cranks with philosophizing adults, he was able to create 'Before Sunrise'. A brilliant film that relies almost entirely on a single conversation. He then gave us this film, again utilizing that dense, brilliant script... but giving us the twist of the same two people meeting nine years later, without any contact in between. So clever, executed so well.",7,1,1,13 January 2015
Man on the Moon," Kaufman's Career in One Movie
","The life and career of a legendary comedian, Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey).If you never had the chance to see Andy Kaufman in his lifetime, this more or less sums up all his characters and his best skits. The Tony Clifton character is best, at least as portrayed in this film, but all have become a part of popular culture. Jim Carrey may or may not exactly look the part, but he was the only man who could have done this and knocks it out of the park.Much like Kaufman himself, this film is hilarious at times and grating at others. Sometimes the laughs came from the audience and sometimes the audiences suffered at Andy's expense. But, of course, this is because he was not so much a comedian as a performance artist. When we expect something else, we only open ourselves to disappointment.",7,1,2,25 March 2015
The Princess Bride," A Must-See, Plain and Simple
","Buttercup is madly in love with the farmboy Westley, but soon after her love blossoms he is captured and killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Picked by the prince to be her bride, she is rescued from ruffians by the pirate who killed her love. Will true love prevail in this tale of romance, action, adventure and more? Like many films, 'The Princess Bride' isn't one i really have to praise. If you don't already love it, you have a friend who will swear up and down that it's one of the most amazing films ever. So you don't need me to convince you. In fact, you've probably already seen it and I'm surprised if you haven't. (Although, the reason for this review is that I was able to recently show my girlfriend the film for the first time, so some of you may have missed out.) As my introduction says, this is a film of romance, action and adventure. I left out comedy. The film has a lot of great one-liners and quotable jokes you'll treasure for a lifetime. Author William Goldman is incredible -- read the novel and you'll see the humor jump off the page -- and the director, Rob Reiner, perfected it for the screen. Of course, if you've seen 'This is Spinal Tap', you already knew how great Reiner was with comedy.Cary Elwes, one of my favorite actors, is great in the leading role (very similar to his role in 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights'). Robin Wright does an adequate job as Buttercup. And then the supporting cast is just some of the best in the business: Fred Savage, Peter Falk, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant, Wallace Shawn, Chris Sarandon (who came off as sort of a jerk in person, but is a solid actor). I could do without Billy Crystal, but someone probably appreciated him.Again, you've probably seen this or have someone you know pushing it. I, too, would push it. I don't know why you're reading reviews for this film. If you're looking for people's thoughts, I'm sure they're overwhelmingly positive. I won't deviate from those people. From the six-fingered man, to the albino, to ROUSes... I love this film.",10,3,9,29 November 2008
Zulu," How to Pick Sides?
","Zululand, South Africa, 1879. The British are fighting the Zulus and one of their columns has just been wiped out at Isandlwana. The Zulus next fix their sights on the small British outpost at Rorke's Drift.This is an interesting film in that it puts the viewer in an awkward position. On the one hand, you want to root for the underdog, right? A couple hundred soldiers against thousands... you want to see them win. But this is now 1964 (or 2017 if you're me) and we have different ideas about colonialism. This land belongs to the locals -- why should we encourage the British? Regardless, this is a great early film from Michael Caine and he is almost unrecognizable to us who know him as the elderly (or at least distinguished) gentleman he became.",6,4,10,18 July 2017
Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg's Soft Heart and a Solid War Movie
","After discovering that three of his brothers have been killed in battle, the War Department orders a group of soldiers to 'save' Private Ryan and send him home to his mother. This act creates a fair amount of conflict, and from there the story really picks up.Steven Spielberg, while a fine director, often becomes sentimental and smarmy. This is no exception. But for the most part, the battles are fierce, the wounds are bloody and the death toll is high. Considered by many to be the greatest of all war films, it easily ranks up there in my book.What I loved most about this film? The casting of Nathan Fillion and Jeremy Davies. Oh my, I can never get enough of those two gentlemen. Beyond that, the realism and the brutality shines through. I appreciate that the Americans executed surrendering Germans (and on one occasion, Czechs) rather than took them prisoner. Is it right? No. But it's realistic.",8,1,4,15 April 2010
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Almost As Grand As The First
","When Hiccup and Toothless discover an ice cave that is home to hundreds of new wild dragons and the mysterious Dragon Rider, the two friends find themselves at the center of a battle to protect the peace.Director Dean DeBlois says that the animation programs used have made the intricate details of facial expression and whatnot more detailed. Frankly, this is not as obvious as DeBlois may like, but it is good to hear animation advancing... within a decade, perhaps the line between animation and real life will be blurred.The overall story here does not seem quite as strong as the first, though it does add two important elements to the story. One, it expands the world of Hiccup. Apparently not much, as they seem to travel to different areas quickly, but this still opens the story up to more possibilities, including possible spinoffs.And two, it balances the message of peace from the first film. Although the first film's idea not to see others as enemies is a very important and timeless message, there will also always be that evil inside people that just never listens to reason. Folks like Hitler (to use the classic example) could only be stopped by force, not reason. Such a character is introduced here, adding to the overall mythos of the Vikings.Where will the story go from here? We eagerly await the next installment.",7,0,3,17 November 2014
The Pianist," An Excellent Movie, Of Course
","I don't have much to say on this movie, other than that it was very good. Adrien Brody is a fine actor and this is probably his finest role (though I'm partial to 'The Jacket').My only real concern with this film ,and it shouldn't be seen as a slight against it, is that it seems that making a film about the Holocaust makes a film automatically better. I'm not sure if it's because it evokes emotions or what, but this film, 'Schindler's List' and others quickly rise to the top of the list of good films... World War II in general seems to do this, but the Holocaust even more so. It's an odd phenomenon.",7,1,4,19 May 2010
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Another Solid Wes Anderson Outing
","The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.This is the highest-grossing Wes Anderson film to date, as well as his highest budget. Some (particularly IMDb voters) would say it is his best. Perhaps. On first viewing, 'Moonrise Kingdom' was the stronger, more cohesive film... but this one may take a bit more time to sink in, and may require multiple viewings.Certainly it has Harvey Keitel in one of his better roles, as well as a near-endless stream of great actors, many of whom (Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman, etc. etc.) have worked with Anderson repeatedly. This may be the film that will grow in stature as the years go on.",8,2,4,4 January 2015
Seabiscuit," More Than Just a Horse Racing Movie
","The story of Seabiscuit, one of the winningest horses of all time. This story is true, the events are true, the characters are real. Sure, things might be fictionalized for the entertainment value, but basically this is it! Seabiscuit was a symbol of hope during the Great Depression for people, a symbol that the underdog could win. It's a bad sign when people have to put their faith in a running horse, but I suppose that's how it was.The characters each have their own outlook. Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), horse trainer: 'every horse is good for something', even if that something is not racing. He's the optimist. Cooper is vastly under-appreciated as an actor.Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), automobile entrepreneur and amateur horse owner: 'everyone needs a second chance', another optimist, though with much less pure motivation. And then Tobey MacGuire as jockey Red Pollard, he's just a blind drunk.William H. Macy as Tick-Tock McLauchlin is the pessimist and cynic, calling Seabiscuit the 'surprise in the punchbowl'. But this is a happy story, so he's proved wrong. Interestingly, the great race is against War Admiral, which happens to be his uncle!",7,5,6,19 May 2010
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Best Horror Comedy Since Zombieland
","Two friends buy a vacation home together, which is a cabin in the woods. A series of misunderstandings follow, leading a group of college kids to accuse them of being deranged serial killers. What ensues is both hilarious and gory...Let me first point out the great cast: Tyler Labine as Dale, Alan Tudyk ('Dodgeball' and 'Knight's Tale') as Tucker. A sexy newcomer named Katrina Bowden as Allison, and Jesse Moss ('Dear Mr. Gacy') as Chad. The rest of the cast is also great, but these key roles made the whole thing perfect and the comedy a smash.My girlfriend and I saw this at HorrorHound Weekend in Indianapolis, and we loved it. I would say she loved it even more than me, with it keeping her laughing the whole time. That, and she loves wood chippers. Yes, there is a wood chipper, and yes, it does get used. That alone should make you want to see it!The version we saw was a work print, so not all the special effects were in place yet. But the humor is what carries the film -- the whole idea of college kids being the heroes and hillbillies being cannibals... it is taken here and twisted, with no real bad guys at all. (The title is somewhat misleading... at no point did the guys fight 'evil'.)I wish I could write a better review, but I could only do that if I pointed out flaws, and there just are not any I can think of. It was well-paced, funny, bloody, sexy (though there is never any nudity) and somewhat charming. This is really a horror-comedy that I think everyone can get behind.",7,5,9,28 March 2011
1941," Spielberg's 'Forgotten' Film
","Hysterical Californians prepare for a Japanese invasion in the days after Pearl Harbor.Can you believe this cast? Robert Stack (in excellent makeup), John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Ned Beatty, John Candy, Christopher Lee, John Landis, Dick Miller, Nancy Allen, Eddie Deezen, Joe Flaherty and the list goes on. Even if this was not a good film (and it is) you should check it out to see a performance from some great actors.While the humor is relatively low (Kubrick allegedly called the film 'great but not funny'), there are some nice moments featuring parodies of previous Spielberg films 'Duel' and 'Jaws'. Great sense of humor, Mr. Spielberg.Today, the Zoot Suit Riot is probably best known as a song from Cherry Popping' Daddies. But it really occurred, and it has never looked better in fiction than it does in this film with a wonderfully long dance and fight sequence that is the centerpiece of the whole film.",6,0,1,15 September 2014
Foxcatcher," Unclear
","The greatest Olympic Wrestling Champion brother team joins Team Foxcatcher led by multimillionaire sponsor John E. du Pont as they train for the 1988 games in Seoul - a union that leads to unlikely circumstances.Despite some great acting from Mark Ruffalo and especially Steve Carell, this film seems to fall flat. Is it about wrestling? The events leading up to a tragedy? The relationship of two brothers? We seem to get such a general view of each part that nothing is ever looked at in any depth and this leaves the film somewhat hollow.The number of Academy Award nomination is a bit surprising. It will likely end up being the most nominated in 2014 with the fewest wins. Carell, though great, is overshadowed by Eddie Redmayne, for example. A makeup award is possible, but only if the voters snub 'Guardians of the Galaxy' for what was obviously a good deal of time-consuming design. (This would not be a complete shock, though... just consider how many horror films do not even receive a nomination for their effects.)",7,0,6,9 February 2015
28 Days Later...," A Tightrope Between Matheson and Walking Dead
","After waking up from a coma, a man named Jim (Cillian Murphy) discovers that the entire city of London and maybe the world has been taken over by a virus that causes people to go into a rage. Now, he is left with only two things to do: find others like himself and learn to survive.This film can be seen as a tightrope connecting 'I Am Legend' (any version you want) and 'The Walking Dead'. Like the former, you have one man alone against a world of post-human monsters in an evacuated large city. He is looking for a cure, or at least a way to survive, and he finds a female companion to share the journey. The differences between the films are relatively minor in the context of the overall plot.And then we have the latter. While the 'Walking Dead' comic or television series could be compared to any zombie apocalypse film, it again features one man alone in a big city (Rick in Atlanta as opposed to Jim in London). Most notably, both start in a hospital. Major West could also be compared to the Governor. This may be a coincidence, or it may be an homage -- according to Robert Kirkman, he had the comic plotted out before he had seen this film.We are given this horrific vision by director Danny Boyle (best known at this point for 'Trainspotting' before getting even bigger with 'Slumdog Millionaire'), and he does a fine job. By saying this film takes elements from predecessors, it may sound like I am being condescending or trying to sell the film short. I am not. Boyle does a wonderful job of showing a desolate city, a man isolated in London (the last place he would expect to be alone) and people infected with the rage virus. Much of horror cinema is not so much being original (a very, very rare thing these days) but taking a well-trod archetype and making it your own.One brave decision that was made was the casting of no-name actors, or at least no actors that stand out for Americans (this is before the 'Doctor Who' franchise took off in the States). Any name actor (such as, say, Leonardo DiCaprio as was rumored) would distract from the grand vision, I feel. It shifts the focus from the story of all humanity to the story of one man. Interestingly, Cillian Murphy has since become a huge star in his own right -- watching the film now (2013) is different than when it first came out because of this.The heart of the film is Brendan Gleeson, who plays Frank. It takes it from a horror or survival film to a story of the goodness of humanity. The saying that sometimes the worst brings out the best in people is exemplified in Frank. His good nature and altruism shine and have a positive effect on those around him.Many consider this a 'zombie' film, while others try to differentiate it from that group (Boyle himself has called it a zombie film). I think there is a distinct difference between a virus that affects the living and the walking dead (even when the walking dead are brought back by a virus). This is, really, just a tale of survival that could have been portrayed similarly as rabies or AIDS. This is another way the film is influential; hundreds of zombie films have come out over the past decade (most of which are terrible), but the rise of the 'infection' film owes its genesis to '28 Days Later'.The only real complaint is the suspension of disbelief we have to have about Jim's beginnings. Waking up from a coma that he was in for at least three weeks, he is able to run easily without muscle atrophy or fatigue. He also survived in a hospital where no one else did. And most amazing of all, he seems to have not urinated or defecated in the bed. But all horror and science fiction films require a little bit of magic, so I think we can mark this off as being in that category.The film is heavy on the survival aspects, moderate on the action, moderate on the gore by 'zombie' standards. And very light on the romance, which I am pleased about (that is one advantage it has over 'Omega Man'). The film is all about trying to make it out alive, and that is something I can see more of -- 'survival horror'. While I would not recommend seeing this until after seeing 'Omega Man' and 'Last Man on Earth' just to put it in perspective, this is a very good addition to the line of films coming out with these themes.",7,3,4,17 March 2007
Lawrence of Arabia," Only One Word Describes This Film: Epic
","Cairo during World War I: T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is a misfit British Army lieutenant, notable only for his insolence and knowledge of the Bedouin. Over the objections of a skeptical General Murray (Donald Wolfit), he is sent by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his revolt against the Turks.This film asks: what makes England great: guns or discipline? And that's a question any nation or empire can ask. America today holds the power England once had, and what makes it great? Seemingly, the guns... military advantage does gain a country economic advantage. But a country can be great in other ways, such as its arts. Was England great in that way? Lawrence had a way of understanding the Middle East that few of his time -- or today -- really did. He made a map of the region and suggested on how to divide up the area. Tribes are given more credence, the Palestinians have their own land, as do the Armenians. Had England listened to Lawrence more, perhaps we would have fewer Middle Eastern disputes today. Perhaps...Historically, Lawrence was seen as asexual and a masochist. It's hard to show his asexuality, though we can say that the film does not portray him as a ladies man. Likewise, while we never see him being an outright masochist, the beating scene does suggest he is capable of taking great pain. To hint that he enjoyed it, though, may be going too far.This film is fantastic. It's a bit hard to get through in one sitting, coming just shy of four hours. But if you use the intermission for a bathroom break or to make a sandwich, it's well worth catching it all in a relatively short amount of time.",8,0,2,9 April 2010
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," An Adequate Follow-Up
","A research team is sent to the Jurassic Park Site B island to study the dinosaurs there while another team approaches with another agenda.What makes this film so interesting is watching it now (2015) and recognizing all the names who were not so big when it came out. Julianne Moore was just starting out (and obviously not on top of her game), Vince Vaughn had just broken out with 'Swingers'. Peter Stormare has made a hundred movies or more, but never got big until 'Prison Break'. And yet, here they are.This is a decent movie and a decent sequel. Not great, not as clever as the first. The plot seems a little forced, but for those who want dinosaur action, it definitely provides that. I am not at all clear why Site B has species of dinosaurs that Site A apparently never did. (In the first film, it is said there are 15 species... I did not count them, but were more added here?)",6,1,8,14 July 2015
It Follows," The Best Horror Film in Years
","A young woman (Maika Monroe) is followed by an unknown supernatural force after getting involved in a sexual encounter.This film hit hard with intense hype, and created two camps: a larger, more positive camp that loved the hype and the film. And a smaller camp, who were disappointed and thought it was much ado about nothing. While it would be hard to say that one side was right and one was wrong (we all have opinions), the larger camp seems to be winning.And why not? We have a fresh, new idea here played out with great actors and some creepy effects. Beyond the involvement of Robert Kurtzman, this was almost completely a cast and crew of people whose names are not going to ring bells in the horror community. But they will now, because many people were terrified. There is something about a creature that slowly stalks that can be far more terrifying than the in-your-face machete-wielder.Most clever is the concept that after the creature (or virus or whatever) is passed on, it could still return to kill you if it kills the next person in line. This makes the task of avoiding it so much more difficult. You could pass it along, but five years later, just as you calm down and get back to a normal routine... bam! It has worked through the chain back to you! Worth singling out is the score from Disasterpiece (Rich Vreeland), Jeff Szpirglas has called a 'nifty fusion' of John Carpenter and Krzysztof Penderecki. The music is one of the best things of the film, completing the hollow, lifeless mood of the setting. It moves in a simple, methodical direction, creating the tension that something is slowly creeping from a distance... or right behind you. That is pure, aural gold.'It Follows' is, without a doubt, the best horror film to be released in years, and perhaps the best of the 21st century so far.",9,2,11,25 May 2015
City of God," City of God, You Have Stolen My Soul!
","This very long movie is entirely in Portuguese (what I call the devil's language). Yet, you quickly get sucked in and no longer notice you're reading subtitles. The story is more or less that of 2 boys in the hood, one who wants to be a photographer. The other follows a very Scarface-esquire path to rise to the peak of gangsterdom. Oddly, while neither one helps the other on purpose, neither could achieve what they did without the other.IMDb currently ranks this film at 18 of all time, which seems greatly over-rated. Good movie? Yeah. Great movie? Yeah. But 18th of all time? Maybe not. Three things I really liked about this film.1. The great use of Carl Douglas' 'Kung Fu Fighting' during a party scene. 2. The explicitness. Full nudity of men and women, little kids swearing and doing drugs - shooting people in cold blood and laughing. It is this ability to shock and stun that really makes this film great and not just a knockoff of other gangster tales. 3. The interwoven tales. Like Pulp Fiction, all the characters connect to all the others - and not always in a linear direction. This film requires a minimum of three viewings to truly appreciate it. Very high recommendation!",8,1,6,11 September 2005
Cars," Most Disappointing Pixar I Have Seen
","I see on the message boards that some think this is Pixar's worst film, and others seem to think it is 'Ratatouille'. Well, I did not see that one. But I can say I found 'Cars' very disappointing.I have to give it a decent rating because the animation was great and the film was fun and had great voices. But the characters were not very deep, there was no real emotion ,and the plot was very predictable. This is a good film to put on for kids to watch, but not really one that involves much deep thought.Is it Pixar's worst? I am not sure. But if it is, that is still a compliment because it means even their worst is better than the average film.",6,2,4,7 February 2011
The Little Mermaid," Launched Disney's Golden Age
","A mermaid princess named Ariel makes a Faustian bargain with an unscrupulous seahag named Ursula in order to meet a human prince named Eric on land.This is the film that really launched Disney's golden age (or what some people call the Renaissance era). Memorable songs, a fun story and characters... the last good Disney animated feature was 'Robin Hood' in 1973, and even that is a stretch.For those of us who grew up in the 1980s, we were rather blessed -- for the next few years the Disney films were amazing, starting with this gem.

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Dance Disguised as Martial Arts
","Two warriors in pursuit of a stolen sword and a notorious fugitive are led to an impetuous, physically skilled, adolescent nobleman's daughter, who is at a crossroads in her life.First and foremost, this is the film that made Ang Lee an international sensation. And we have been very blessed to have him. Sure, his Incredible Hulk film was not the greatest, but this is more because of the character than the directing.Why this film works is because it turns martial arts into dance. The 'kung fu' film has always been seen as a b-movie, even when it is a good one. Here, the fighting is a routine and the dancers literally fly through the air. Such a brilliant idea, a real work of art.",8,0,0,15 December 2014
JFK," Conspiracies May Be Dumb, But Make For Great Cinema
","In the words of Kevin Costner's character, 'I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.' Costner's character in 'Bull Durham', that is... not 'JFK'. Because here we are given quite the opposite picture. Oswald is assisted by everyone: the Mafia, the CIA, the military, Cuba and even President Johnson.And if you're someone who plays Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, you want to have this film under your belt: an ensemble cast of Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek, John Candy and many more.While I don't think the picture presented in this film is true, it was a great movie nonetheless. Costner brings in the performance of his career, providing a character with passion and courage and one of the best monologues I have ever heard. Pesci is a little wired, but it fits his character. Bacon is great as usual. Oldman could easily be mistaken for the real Lee Harvey Oswald. And Jones? One weird individual, though I think this is what the real Clay Shaw was like as I understand it.You will have to pay close attention or take notes to fully understand what is going on, since even though you get three hours the complexities fly at you all the time and you're left thinking either this is the biggest cover-up ever, or the main character (Jim Garrison) is completely stark raving mad.But I was kept in suspense all the way through, because I tried to keep an open mind and I didn't know how the real story ended up... so it was almost all new to me. And worth every minute.",8,0,12,16 October 2006
Gone Girl," Twisted Mind Game
","With his wife (Rosamund Pike)'s disappearance having become the focus of an intense media circus, a man (Ben Affleck) sees the spotlight turned on him when it is suspected that he may not be innocent.Not being familiar with the source material, most of the twists and turns came completely unexpected. And it was just such a wild trip, one that could be experienced again and again (probably making more sense with each viewing). Affleck is strong here, and Pike absolutely steals the show. Whether this is a contender for Best Picture or Best Director is doubtful, but Pike has a strong shot at Best Actress.Shockingly, Neil Patrick Harris is not as strong of an actor as one might think, though his role is relatively small. Tyler Perry, on the other hand, is amazing and will blow anyone away who thinks of him simply as the 'Madea' guy. The plot slows down a bit in the third act, but overall is a tense thriller that is sure to please any movie fan. David Fincher has not made a bad movie yet.",8,2,8,11 January 2015
Django Unchained," One of Tarantino's Finest Works
","With the help of a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz), a freed slave (Jamie Foxx) sets out to rescue his wife (Kerry Washington) from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio).Take the blaxploitation classics 'Boss' and 'Mandingo', throw in some spaghetti westerns, stir them around inside the brain of Quentin Tarantino, and you get this: another masterpiece from the perennial film student. Whether or not one likes his directing or his acting, Tarantino's writing has always been his strong point, and he exhibits that again here.I want to address the issue of race, as this film sort of forces us to do. Spike Lee said about the film, 'All I'm going to say is that it's disrespectful to my ancestors. That's just me... I'm not speaking on behalf of anybody else.' Although I am a white man and cannot speak as the descendant of American slaves, I did find it to be a powerful condemnation of slavery unlike we have seen nearly anywhere else. The film was the flip side to 'Gone With the Wind'. And its moral ambiguity was done flawlessly -- Django is the hero, yet he kills mercilessly and even allows slaves to die if it helps him meet his goals. He is an egoistic utilitarian -- no harm is too much if it helps his personal greater good.'Django' and its approach to race is interesting from the perspective of someone who has watched Tarantino's career unfold. While I would hardly consider Tarantino a racist, he has written some questionable lines over the years, and batted the n-word around more freely than most white folks would feel proper doing (e.g. the 'dead n***** storage' line in 'Pulp Fiction' or the exchange in 'True Romance' where Sicilians were said to have 'black blood' and were 'spawned by n*****s'). Yet, he has frequently had strong black characters (Marcellus Wallace, and especially Jackie Brown). What do we make of this? Has Tarantino found a way to transcend race in ways few others have? I also want to put the film in perspective. Owen Gleiberman wrote that 'Django isn't nearly the film that Inglourious was. It's less clever, and it doesn't have enough major characters â or enough of Tarantino's trademark structural ingenuity â to earn its two-hour-and-45-minute running time.' I am mixed on this remark. While I do think that 'Inglourious' was a stronger film and more tightly scripted (some of the references and allusions are so subtle, it takes repeated views to really get them), and I definitely think 'Django' could have been told in 90 rather than 165 minutes, I do not mind its length. Again, referring to the moral ambiguity, we see this evolve and move forward as new situations arise.On the acting front, Jamie Foxx is excellent and this is his best performance since 'Ray', maybe ever. Leonardo DiCaprio falls short of his best work, but is still good. Christoph Waltz is the real gem here, much like he was in 'Inglourious' -- why he does so few American films is a mystery. The most debatable performance seems to be on Samuel L. Jackson. I did not find him to be doing his best (I prefer him in 'Black Snake Moan'), but others say this should have been his time to be recognized and awarded. I think opportunities passed before, and hopefully will not be overlooked again, but this was not it.Best Picture? No. Best Director? No. But I can definitely see Best Screenplay and it is great to see that Tarantino's best work has been in the last five years -- it makes me think whatever he touches next will (again) be gold.",8,1,6,21 January 2013
Drive," The Dangerous Ryan Gosling!
","A mysterious Hollywood stuntman and mechanic (Ryan Gosling) moonlights as a getaway driver and finds himself trouble when he helps out his neighbor (Carey Mulligan).This film has a great supporting cast with Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman and more. Together, they really light up the screen and turn a better-than-average crime film into a real spectacle. Maybe not as great as first made out to be, but even after the hype, still a solid piece of cinema.Mulligan really needs to get bigger. She had a brief spike with 'An Education', but already (2015) seems to be fading back into obscurity. Someone rescue her, cast her as the lead in your next film.

","A family looks to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child (Ty Simpkins) in a realm called The Further.This film is marketed as being from the creators of 'Paranormal Activity', which makes sense given the subject matter -- but this is really the brainchild of the 'Saw' boys -- being directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell (who also appears as a character). For an added bonus, horror veteran Lin Shaye is here in one of her best roles.This film is legitimately creepy. I am not big on 'jump' or 'bus' scares, and even less of a fan of computer animation, but this film just impressed me. There were so many shots that made it worthwhile, with quick flashes of a shadowy figure -- just enough to get the imagination to conjure up something more. The best balance for horror is the use of the seen and the unseen in a certain mixture -- not sure precisely how much, but the makers of this film clearly do. I think 'Insidious' was overlooked by many and that is just a shame.The advertising consistently used quotes from reviews to insist this film is the best thing since either 'Poltergeist' or 'Exorcist'. I assume anyone who reads that thinks it's an exaggeration. But do not think it exaggerates too much -- these are not just cherry-picked quotes. While putting 'Insidious' in the same league as either of those two films is hard to do, it is not far behind... in fact, I would not even mind saying it gives 'Poltergeist' a run for its money...While I hope 'Insidious' does not turn into a franchise (we are all a little burned out on 'Saw', 'Paranormal Activity' and 'The Collector'), as it stands, this film is a winner. It takes the haunting subgenre of horror and completely turns it on its head... for the better.",7,1,4,12 July 2011
The Theory of Everything," Surprisingly Enjoyable
","A look at the relationship between the famous physicist Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and his wife (Felicity Jones).Upon the first glance, you might think this would be a terrible film. A love story between an incapacitated scientist and his wife? Sounds boring, or at the very least overly sentimental. But it ends up being neither.Redmayne sells the film. As of now (January 2015) he won the Golden Globe and has been nominated for an Oscar. He ought to win it. Hawking himself has said that Redmayne had an uncanny impersonation going on, and he is right. Whether or not this story is strictly true does not matter... this is the sort of performance that makes a film worth watching.",7,2,3,18 January 2015
Frozen," A Return to Disney's Glory Years?
","Fearless optimist Anna (Kristen Bell) teams up with Kristoff in an epic journey, encountering Everest-like conditions, and a hilarious snowman named Olaf in a race to find Anna's sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom in eternal winter.'Frozen' is quite possibly the strongest film in Disney's catalog since the glory days of the late 80s and early 90s. While last year's 'Wreck-It Ralph' was a marvel to behold and among their most enjoyable films ever, 'Frozen' comes to play with a stream of great songs and some good humor (Olaf the snowman will quickly grow on you).The source material, Hans Christian Andersen, is heavily buried in this story, which seems to owe much more to original thinking with just a dash of Kurt Vonnegut's 'Cat's Cradle'. And this is a good thing, because the fairy tale is quite dark and relies too much on Christian theology with demons and such. (Not that Christian theology makes a bad film -- the world of Narnia is beloved -- but it would be out of character for Disney.) One wonders if this will be the breakout role for Kristen Bell. While already known as Veronica Mars, she never quite hit the mainstream. Now, with her vocal talents on full display, she seems poised to make the next step (whatever that may be).Is this the best animated feature of 2013? Quite possibly.",8,2,8,27 January 2014
2012," Not A Bad Film, For What It Is
","Rather than write a full review at this time, let's just sum this up: the plot is implausible, the science ridiculous, the jokes cheesy and the action way over the top. That being said, if you want to see John Cusack living a fast-paced world of action, Woody Harrelson as a manic preacher, and don't mind a near-infinite series of improbable coincidences and things falling apart, this movie is for you.One side note: what is up with the romance and family stuff? Cusack's character is separated from his wife (Amanda Peet) and she has a new beau, who seems likable and the kids love. There's sort of a subplot of Cusack and Peet maybe getting back together, but what's the motivation? It never really makes sense.",6,1,3,18 January 2010
The Number 23," Far Better Story Than the Consensus Let On
","Jim Carrey stars as a man who discovers a book with striking similarities to his own life. He becomes obsessed with the book and its fascination with the number 23. Eventually, he discovers the book is not a story at all but a confession of a real-life murder, and the second half of the film deals with him trying to find the author of the book (the killer).When this came out in theaters, I was mildly interested in it. More for the number 23 than for the story or Jim Carrey. Numerology is an interesting thing, and while I don't believe in it I find it can be played out very well in films. This film is no exception -- the writer made sure to fully cover the obsession with the number as well as the rational explanation of how it can appear so often in the natural world. I appreciate the second part especially.Many people, I think, were afraid of Carrey taking on a serious role. He does have a difficult time being perceived as serious by fans, and even I thought he seemed unnatural. Don't get me wrong -- 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is an amazing movie, and Carrey was wonderful in it. Here, too, he comes across as dramatic and dark -- a raw, sexual beast with a shady past. I never expected a Carrey of this magnitude and it's a nice change.Tom Lenk shows up briefly, as a book store clerk. Every time I see Lenk I feel bad -- he always gets one or two lines in his movies, but never a leading role. Please, Hollywood, this is a funny man. If not a main character ,at least give hi ma supporting role that really adds to the story. If Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd can make movies where they just show up and make crack comments (thank you, Judd Apatow) then so can Lenk.This movie has some twists and turns and doesn't really pick up until they begin to track the killer. Even then, it twists and turns some more. I suppose some people could have predicted the ending or a few of the twists, but I didn't. And that really impressed me -- an ending that made sense and was not foreseen. Sure, some parts stretch the imagination and reality a little bit, but nothing seemed impossible.I found this to be one of the better thrillers or semi-horror (if we use horror very loosely) films to come out in 2007. Over all, this has been a disappointing year. Other than, say, 'Vacancy' I really wasn't all that impressed. So, this might be the drink of fresh water some people had been waiting for. I know I was pleasantly surprised and impressed, and I hope you will be, too.",7,1,2,30 September 2007
The Lives of Others," The Wall
","In 1984 East Berlin, an agent of the secret police (Ulrich MÃ¼he), conducting surveillance on a writer (Sebastian Koch) and his lover (Martina Gedeck), finds himself becoming increasingly absorbed by their lives.Apparently, this was one of the first post-Berlin Wall films to be a drama rather than a comedy (such as Wolfgang Becker's 'Good Bye, Lenin!'). Certainly the best, if not the first. Today it is somewhat hard to imagine that not long ago Germany was split, with two sides spying on each other, when they were really one people under two governments.Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, describing it as 'a powerful but quiet film, constructed of hidden thoughts and secret desires.' Very esoteric, Roger. There is certainly much more going on than is openly expressed in the film.",7,2,3,20 November 2014
Good Will Hunting," The Best Thing Kevin Smith Ever Touched
","Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a janitor at M.I.T., has a gift for mathematics, but needs help from a psychologist (Robin Williams) to find direction in his life. What do we have here? An early acting job for Casey Affleck, produced by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier (the best thing they have ever touched), with a score from Danny Elfman. That score is something else, because it is not one that Elfman is usually associated with, being much more subtle than his typical work.Is this Matt Damon's best role? Most likely. Robin Williams' best role? Quite possibly. Ben Affleck's best role? Maybe even that. This film just sort of brought the best out of everyone involved, and is entertaining to boot.",8,1,4,12 November 2014
Room," A Sparse Tale Powered By Two Strong Leads
","After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a thrilling discovery.The difference between this film and a B-grade thriller or revenge film is in the level of performance achieved by the two leads, Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. They are the beginning middle and end of everything good about this film. (And luckily, they are strong enough to cancel out William H. Macy, who is horribly miscast in this movie.) There is no doubt that Brie Larson will win the Oscar for Best Actress, and no doubt that she deserves it. After her picking up a Golden Globe and a SAG Award, it would be very strange to applaud anyone else. She is strong, weak, sad, elated, protective and terrified. This is just about the fullest range of emotions that a person can have, especially in under two hours on screen.Many have noted that Jacob Tremblay is equally good. Some say he is even better than Larson (and that is quite possible). Yet he did not get a nomination. This is definitely unfortunate. Whether he is on par with Leonardo DiCaprio's strength this year is hard to say, but it seems that Tremblay easily was more intense, more memorable than Matt Damon. With all due respect to Matt Damon.Not having read the book, I can make no commented on the adapted screenplay. I think the script we end up with is excellent, but if the award is for the adaptation, that might be more difficult to call.This leaves Best Director and Best Picture. I find it very unlikely that Lenny Abrahamson will win. He definitely deserves to be in this category, and he has risen relatively quickly. 2014's 'Frank' was a quirky little film that deserved more attention, and 'Room' is going to launch him into the A-list. His next film is rumored to be a Civil War story, and although that has been done to death (what hasn't?), many eyes will now be on it.And Best Picture? That would be quite the upset. Some people have really gotten behind the film. Richard Roeper, for example, thinks 'Room' is one of the best films of the decade. He would love to see 'Room' go home with the little golden man. But it would be an uphill fight. Most likely it will end up taking third or fourth place (and we are not privy to the votes).",8,1,8,1 February 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Greatest Fantasy Film of All Time?
","Quite simply, Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is the best fantasy film series ever made. This is surprising for people who are familiar with Jackson's earliest work ('Bad Taste', for example). But give the man a decent budget and he can command a film. Of the three films, this is possibly the strongest (though the third is also good). Generally, fight scenes tend to bore me, but here Jackson makes them interesting, fun to watch and 'epic' in the best sense of the word.Although coming in at three hours, the extended edition adds on another forty minutes. I have not seen this, but from what I hear it is a must-see. And I cannot disagree. The three hours is all killer, no filler... if the remaining scenes are just as good, there is no reason to miss out on them.",8,1,5,13 September 2010
Schindler's List," A Now-Classic Tale of Salvation In Poland
","In Poland during World War II, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazis.Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself. Indeed, the biggest criticism the film gets is that it came from Spielberg, well known for his sentimentality. Had another director made the same film, it would probably be considered flawless.One can wonder about the casting of Liam Neeson as a Moravian German, when he clearly is not. But with such a strong acting ability, this can be overlooked. The casting of Ben Kingsley was brilliant, even if he is not Jewish, and it is a shame this role is not the one he is best known for. Somehow Ralph Fiennes got a supporting actor nomination, but not Kingsley? The choice to film in black and white makes sense, as Spielberg wanted a 'documentary' feel. Does the infusion of red take away from this? Some might say so.This film racked up a slew of awards, including several Oscars, and this is well-deserved. Despite its critics, this will no doubt go on to be considered one of the greatest films of all time, and easily the best to address the Holocaust.",8,9,13,4 November 2014
The Incredibles," Pixar Super Heroes
","A family of undercover superheroes, while trying to live the quiet suburban life, are forced into action to save the world.This is a fun film that allowed Pixar the opportunity to think up a variety of new heroes and villains. Of course, the number of powers different people can have is rather limited and is probably exhausted, but coming up with new names is fun and they have done that well.The casting is a little strange. Jason Lee was a great choice, but Holly Hunter and Craig T. Nelson were an odd pair to pick. Not saying they are a bad casting choice, just an odd one. But one supposes you can only use Patrick Warburton only so many times.",7,0,0,11 December 2014
The Mist," Some Annoynaces Abound, But the Movie Packs a Punch
","A group of people get trapped in a grocery store after a mysterious mist rolls down from the hills after a storm. Some get scared, some turn religious and others become heroes. What caused this mist and how can anyone survive it? You'll have to watch to find out.This film contained a lot of actors who are largely unknown or have a face you might recognize but not the name. In a film that has an 'ensemble cast' this is probably the best way to make all characters equal. Thomas Jane ('Punisher') is the lead, and others you might recognize appear such as William Sadler ('Shawshank Redemption', 'Demon Knight' and the Grim Reaper from 'Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey'). Overall, though, these are lesser-knowns.I will give you my honest reaction to this film: I wanted to walk out on it. I really did. It had fade-in and fade-out like a TV movie, it had a large group of people in an apocalyptic setting which is such a Stephen King clichÃ©. And when the tentacle showed up, I saw some truly awful CGI work (although it got better with the bugs... at least a little). But after the walking out feeling faded (which I haven't felt since 'Herbie Fully Loaded') I started to think it was okay...When it was okay, I thought the idea was good and the characters were alright. I mean, all the characters were so one-dimensional ('the oppressed minority', 'the bumbling hick', 'the hero', 'the religious nut') but it worked alright. The religious lady was so over-powering that I was unsure if she was a really good actress or overdoing it. I wouldn't have written / directed it to be such a strong character, but that's just me. Again I waited, and it got better.Of course, as always, the ending must remain a secret. But that's the reason I ended up giving it a decent rating, because all the bad things about the film seem to be forgotten once the very dramatic end comes around. I expected better from the man who brought us 'Shawshank' and 'The Green Mile' (I mean Darabont, not King) but it was still beautiful in its own way.There isn't much more to say about the film. It's suspenseful, it has some gore (no nudity). It's not really very scary, and there's not much reason to watch it twice. I mean, it's really good, but it's nothing that screams 'movie of the year'. It's a group of people trapped together to face certain death. If you've read King or seen his movies, this is old news to you. But I recommend it for one viewing. I guess if you want to watch it again, that's your choice... I don't plan to see it again unless I get tricked into it or get paid or there's free dinner involved.",7,1,5,9 December 2007
Stardust," An Adult Fairy Tale Everyone Will Love
","I wanted to see this film after I figured out what it is was. After I saw the preview, I was like 'this looks like a mash of complete random stuff' which didn't really interest me. But once I found out what it was -- Neil Gaiman's work, and allegedly an adult version of 'Princess Bride'.I keep hearing 'Princess Bride' everywhere I turn. Let me say, it's a lot more like a cross between 'Big Fish' and 'Pan's Labyrinth' -- I love Bride, but the link is weak.Is 'Stardust' the best film of 2007? I would say it may be. And Robert DeNiro has never shined so bright. Unfortunately, Claire Danes is looking like she needs a sandwich... but aside from that, a flawless film.",9,0,1,25 January 2008
The Elephant Man," Lynch's Best Work in a Serious Vein
","A Victorian surgeon (Anthony Hopkins) rescues a heavily disfigured man (John Hurt) who is mistreated while scraping a living as a side-show freak. Behind his monstrous facade, there is revealed a person of intelligence and sensitivity.First of all, Mel Brooks produced this? And was able to convince the studio to let it be filmed in black and white (which was a great choice)? Well played, Brooks. You deserve far more respect than you are already given just for this.Second of all, John or Joseph? The film calls him John Merrick, but apparently his name was really Joseph Merrrick. Why the discrepancy? Is he called John in the memoirs? This is confusing, and strange that (probably because of the film) he is now universally remembered as John.While this is not Lynch's masterpiece (that has to go to 'Blue Velvet'), it is possibly his best work critically. Obviously the Academy thought so. And apart from the fact it features a deformed man, there is nothing strange about the plot or themes. This may be Lynch's most 'real' film, as even 'The Straight Story' is pretty odd in a number of ways.",8,1,3,24 July 2013
I Am Legend," A Poor, Over-hyped Telling of a Good Story -- Trash
","Virologist Robert Neville is the last man in New York after surviving a plague that was meant to cure cancer. Somehow, he is one of the few who was immune. Now, he continues to search for a cure while patrolling the streets with his dog, looking for survivors like himself. But, as the tagline says, 'the last man on earth is not alone.'I had heard a lot of bad things about this film before going into it. My colleague, Tristan Sinns, trashed it in his review. I heard it was action-packed (which seems silly when you're by yourself in a desolate city). And it was directed by Francis Lawrence, who made 'Constantine' (which, unlike everyone else, I don't care for). I tried to have an open mind and not compare it to the past versions I already enjoyed ('Last Man on Earth' and 'Omega Man'). Clearly, this film doesn't match up to either of its predecessors, so don't watch those first if you want a chance of liking this one.The biggest complaint I heard from people was what the critics call the 'third-act collapse'. As always, I cannot reveal the end, but I will say that there is some truth to the 'collapse' -- after a suspenseful beginning and middle, we do spend a fairly short time trying to wrap everything up. And pretty much everyone who saw the film didn't agree with the way it was wrapped up. Myself, I thought it was abrupt but that the manner of the execution was decent and made sense. It certainly could have been much worse, and I'm glad that they chose a serious approach to the subject matter.Another complaint I heard was about the 'excessive and unrealistic' CGI. Believe me, I couldn't agree more. My hatred for computer effects is deep, and this film made sure to use every possible computer effect it could. Deer, lions and even infected humans are all computer-generated, and poorly done. If you can't get a real lion or deer, at least make them look good. And why have the people animated? It made them look cheesy and not the least bit scary. It's not hard to get people to be played by... wait for it... people! And it's not hard to make them look infected with a virus, as has been done in hundreds of films before.If I had to say one good thing about this film, it's Neville's turn from God. Will Smith, in interviews, compared Robert Neville to Job. Except for the big difference: Job loses his family and becomes diseased and still loves God. Neville loses it all and ceases to believe in God. I found this to be somewhat edgy for the film and especially for Smith. There was no need to bring religion into the film, but I'm glad that they chose to do it in this manner: a strong, atheist character who still has impeccable morals despite a lack of faith. That's a bold move.I don't recommend this film. At all. Watch 'Last Man on Earth', 'Omega Man' or '28 Days Later'. Don't watch this one. It's bringing in high ratings now (for reasons I cannot understand), but I don't see it passing the test of time. A year or two from now and this film will fade into obscurity, or so I hope. Die-hard Will Smith fans will love it, and all others will just be bored.",4,18,31,6 January 2008
Dog Day Afternoon," Does Loving a Transvestite Make You Gay?
","As with other films on the Top 250 list, I often find myself asking, 'Is this picture ranked too high or not high enough?' In the case of 'Lord of the Rings', the answer is they're ranked way too high. And 'Dog Day Afternoon', while not a bad film, seems a bit odd to be ranked so high (although most Pacino fans would disagree).The movie is a telling of the true story of a man and his friend who rob a bank to try to get funds for a very just cause. I won't say what that cause is, because this is what makes the film really interesting. Al Pacino is the perfect bank robber. This should be no surprise, as Pacino is great in basically everything he does ('Scent of a Woman', 'Scarface', 'Gigli'). And pairing him with his 'Godfather' co-star seems a logical choice.If you want an emotional film where you sympathize with the bank robber, this is your film. It's hard to be against Sonny (Pacino). At points, he even had the crowd and media outside the bank cheering him on.With all this praise, you're wondering why I doubt it's a Top 250 film. And the simple answer is pacing. This film takes place 99% of the time in a bank, in one room. Very little happens in this room. So, what we saw in 2 hours could have been trimmed to 90 minutes without really losing anything, in my opinion. There is a fine line between 'suspense' and 'waiting around'. Also, this film has no music or background sound. That makes the pacing seem even slower than it already is.But it's still a good movie. And if you like Al Pacino, at some point you really must watch this movie because there's never going to be one like it again. Recommended for Pacino fans, and preferably you shouldn't watch it alone.",5,8,19,8 March 2006
School of Rock," Jack Black Gets to Be Himself
","A wannabe rock star in need of cash (Jack Black) poses as a substitute teacher at a prep school, and tries to turn his class into a rock band.This is clearly a great film venture for Jack Black (or half of Tenacious D), and it is clear that the script was written with him in mind. You simply cannot see any actor-musician in the role of Dewey Finn besides Black. Jared Leto? No way.Not that this is Black's best performance. That would probably have to be 'Bernie'. But this is the only film where Black really gets to be Black and it propels the story, makes him out to be a hero. Sure, it may not be completely realistic. But it really is not supposed to be. It is a fun movie, and it should make you just a little bit pumped (if you love rock and roll).",7,1,1,11 December 2014
Amadeus," An Interesting Take on the Amadeus Story
","Peter Schaffer (perhaps better known as the writer of 'Equus') has an interesting tale to tell: an annoying laugh coming from the belly of God through the mouth of Amadeus, which angers and frustrates his chief rival. Is there a historical basis for the laugh, the rivalry, or the manner of Amadeus' death? Not really, but we can just let that slide because it makes a good story.I really loved this film ,and even though it was nearly three hours long, it seemed to go very quickly. Tom Hulce, who I know from nothing else, was a delightful Amadeus. At first he was a pain, but once I adjusted and began to sympathize with him, I think he played the part perfectly. Beyond that, everyone played their parts well -- even Jeffrey Jones, who (for me) is hard to see as anything but a comic actor or a Tim Burton regular.",9,2,3,12 May 2010
The Game," Fincher's Followup to Seven
","Wealthy San Francisco financier Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) gets a strange birthday present from wayward brother Conrad (Sean Penn): a live-action game that consumes his life.This is a strange film, and one that is hard to follow at times because it is so unexpected. One could rightly call it two hours of red herrings. Never get too attached to any characters or scenes, because they could change or disappear at any time. Is this a strength or a weakness? What strikes me is that this film was picked up by Criterion. Not saying it did not deserve their attention, but it is a bit unusual. The movie is not old, foreign, independent... it is not a movie that slipped under the radar (though it is not as well-remembered today as some of Fincher's other films). Well played, Criterion.",7,1,2,22 May 2015
Kick-Ass," Super Short Review
","Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan who one day decides to become a super-hero, even though he has no powers, training or meaningful reason to do so.Shortest review I ever wrote: Lyndsy Fonseca was great as Katie Deauxma, and I would like to see more of her. Clark Duke is already overexposed (between this film and 'Hot Tub Time Machine'). Please stop casting him, he is not the next Jonah Hill.Chloe Moretz is the best young actress in the business today, and while I already knew that years ago, films like this one and 'Let Me In' are proving it. If you need a young actress and Dakota Fanning is too old, go Chloe Moretz. I do not care what Roger Ebert says about the violence, this film is great.",7,2,6,30 August 2011
The Man Who Would Be King," An Interesting Tale
","Two British soldiers in India decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan -- a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander.Can you go wrong with Michael Caine or Sean Connery -- or both together? I imagine not. While I am hardly a fan of Rudyard Kipling's work, this makes me thing that perhaps there is a story of his I like. Or maybe I am just blinded by the Caine-Connery.What I find interesting is the story taking place in Kafiristan, a Hindu region on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The story was written in the 1800s, and the film was made in 1975. The area probably was not well known in 1975, but soon became better known in 1979 when the Russians invaded. In 2001, the Americans also invaded the area... and as the film says, no one has held it since Alexander the Great.So, the film's appeal for me is the tie to modern history and current events, though the factuality of the story is quite questionable.",6,2,7,4 May 2011
Ghostbusters," The Most Successful Mixture of Horror and Comedy, Hands Down
","Three scientists of the paranormal, kicked out of their cushy university jobs, pursue careers in the private sector as investigators of ghosts and such... and not a moment too soon, because there is about to be an explosion of hauntings in the New York area! There is not much to say about 'Ghostbusters'... it is a classic, hands down. The theme song is known even by non-fans, there was a great sequel, action figures, video games, a cartoon series... everyone in this went on to big things (some were already big). You do not get many horror comedies that appeal to people outside the genre, but this one does (along with the sequel).Director Ivan Reitman knew what he was doing. Although perhaps better known for his comedies, he actually started out working with master of horror David Cronenberg. When he came to 'Ghostbusters', he had every intention of making it scary. And he succeeded. Perhaps not generally thought of as horror because of its wide appeal, there are some legitimately scary moments. The librarian early on? Quite a shock!And that is it. I do not have to say that this is a great film or that I could watch it again and again... you know this. It scared me as a kid, but now... just a classic. Who hasn't seen 'Ghostbusters'?",8,0,0,29 July 2010
Gran Torino," Truly One of the Best Pictures of The Year
","A Korean War veteran (Clint Eastwood) whose wife has passed on finds himself alone in the old neighborhood, where various minorities have moved in. When a Hmong youth tries to steal his car, Walter begins to confront the people around him and his own prejudice. Can Walter change at this late in the game? What is really beautiful about this film is the way it approaches the topics covered in it. While seemingly a film about race, it's really more about the gap between generations. Walter doesn't connect with his kids, they don't understand him -- making efforts that are misplaced, if thoughtful -- and there's just a sense that 'the old ways' aren't appreciated by many. And the film makes it clear it's not taking sides; while a film about Walter, it doesn't condone or criticize his actions.The common sense idea that this film is about race strikes me as wrong. Walter is not, in fact, a racist as many have made him out to be. He quickly adapts to his Hmong neighbors and is fairly accepting of them. He uses racial slurs, but never performs any racist actions... and there is evidence that his slurs are meant to be harmless, as he talks the same way to the few friends he has.Some of the twists and turns are unexpected, and the way the older generation teaches the young (and the young teaches the old) is inspiring. Eastwood claims this is his last film as an actor, which is likely not true, but a high note to go out on if he sticks to it.",9,2,12,4 October 2009
Hero," Beautiful Fantastic Film
","A defense officer, Nameless (Jet Li), was summoned by the King of Qin regarding his success of terminating three warriors.This film is very much in the style of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', with the bright colors and flying warriors. The 'dance' effect is somewhat toned down, but fans of one will no doubt be fans of the other. Plus this one has Donnie Yen, who may be the greatest martial arts actor in the business today.Roger Ebert called the film 'beautiful and beguiling, a martial arts extravaganza defining the styles and lives of its fighters within Chinese tradition.' Ebert knows what he is talking about, and Tarantino was wise to get this film a wide showing in the United States.",7,0,0,8 January 2015
The Hurt Locker," Best Picture of 2009?
","With about one month left in Iraq, a group of American soldiers is tasked with finding and neutralizing explosives. This, of course, has some obvious hazards and side effects. Who will survive until the end of their tour? As I type this, we're less than a month away from the Oscars. 'Hurt Locker' is seen as the leading contender to the unstoppable juggernaut that is 'Avatar'. And this puts me in a quandary. I really take issue with 'Avatar' getting so much praise for such an old plot, but then I see 'Hurt Locker' and as great as it is... not really what I'd think of as a best picture.It's a good war film, and has some political messages (as all war films inevitably do), but I don't know. Compare it to 'Stop Loss' or 'Body of Lies'... and it's not even nearly on the level of 'Syriana'. Kathryn Bigelow has made a fine film, and a good departure from her horror/sci-fi history, but I don't know if this is the big Iraq film we've been waiting for.It was nice to see Guy Pearce back in the spotlight, though.",7,3,10,10 February 2010
The Longest Day," The Other Big WWII Movie
","The events of D-Day, told on a grand scale from both the Allied and German points of view.It seems that everyone is familiar with 'Tora Tora Tora'. I had to watch it in school, and I am sure many others did, too. It is a great look at both sides of the Pearl Harbor attack. Maybe not 100% accurate, but a serious attempt to see a global event from multiple angles.Fewer people probably know about 'Longest Day', even though it has a similar premise and a great cast -- Robert Mitchum, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, and many others. It looks at D-Day from multiple sides, and taught me that Hitler liked to take naps. It even had some humor (which may actually be inappropriate -- this seems like a very bloodless war).",6,1,3,31 March 2016
Moulin Rouge!," Such Beauty!
","A poet (Ewan McGregor) falls for a beautiful courtesan (Nicole Kidman) whom a jealous duke covets in this stylish musical, with music drawn from familiar 20th century sources.Some people are really hard on Baz Luhrman, and I can understand why. It is easy to fault him for style over substance, or for taking classics like 'Romeo and Juliet' and twisting them in ways we may not necessarily like. But I am not a detractor of his. Maybe 'Strictly Ballroom' is not my cup of tea, but this film ('Moulin Rouge!') is pretty amazing.The colors, the clever re-interpretation of modern music. And some solid casting. Nicole Kidman has a handful of good roles and many others that are completely forgettable. (Probably most actors can say the same thing.) Luckily, this is one of her memorable ones.",8,0,3,12 June 2015
Meet Joe Black," Carries Itself Well
","Death, who takes the form of a young man (Brad Pitt), asks a media mogul (Anthony Hopkins) to act as a guide to teach him about life on Earth and in the process he falls in love with his guide's daughter (Claire Forlani).So this is a remake of a movie that was adapted from a play. Typically that could be concerning, as a remake is not often as good as the original. In this case, though, it may even be better... the cast is solid (with Forlani in one of her rare decent roles), and Brad Pitt making a name for himself (as if he has not already).Really, this is a great display of Pitt's acting. He has solid range here, possibly more than anything else he has done. The character is very complex, and there is the odd twist that Forlani is attracted to him because he looks like someone he is not, and not for any deeper reason. Amazingly, even at three hours, this film never drags.",7,1,1,16 June 2016
Ex Machina," The Underrated Gem of 2015
","A young programmer is selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment in synthetic intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breath-taking humanoid A.I.Without question, 'Ex Machina' may be the most underrated of the 2015 Oscar nominees. It received two nominations: best visual effects and best original screenplay. The effects are good, and it deserves to be nominated in this category, but it might be tough to squeak by given how many films these days are effects-heavy. I wouldn't count it out, but it's no sure thing.As for best original screenplay, I really hope that the voters see the brilliance in this script. There have been attempts to bring AI stories to the screen for at least fifty years, and some of them are very good. But I dare say this may well be the best. The exploration of what it means to be a person or have consciousness is done perfectly, and the issue is more important now than ever before. What was once a philosophical hypothesis is now an inevitability... like it or not, Apple, IBM and Google are nearing this goal.What really sells the story is the discussion of prototypes. Once you create a living machine, however imperfect, can you simply take it apart without moral consequence? A parent may threaten that, 'I made you, and I can end you.' But of course that is not true -- the murder of a child is reprehensible. In the eyes of a god, is the destruction of a machine with feelings and dreams any less cruel? The script also excels in its references. We have Wittgenstein, Mary Shelley and Oppenheimer to name a few. There is a great use of Jackson Pollack to explain how unconscious thought works. And the deeper issues are mentioned without getting too boring or down in the weeds. Anyone interested in the philosophy or the computer science can find more at their local library -- we are given just enough here to start that dialogue. (I expect this movie to be shown in ethics classes for years to come.) The question then is, if the film is underrated, what did the Academy miss? Alicia Vikander, of course. She was nominated for 'The Danish Girl', but after seeing both films, it seems clear she was more remarkable in this one. She deserved the nod for this rather than the other one, or perhaps even both. (It is not unheard of for an actor or actress to get two nominations in the same category.) I would also not be opposed to Oscar Isaac getting a supporting actor nomination, as he really made himself known.Now, maybe I am being a bit bold here, but I think 'Ex Machina' would have been a worthy contender in the best picture category. It clearly edges out some of the lesser films, notably 'Brooklyn'. Maybe there was no room with the other science fiction ('Martian') or fantasy ('Mad Max') movies... I can understand that. The Oscars love dramas and period pieces. But I do hope just being nominated for some of the lesser awards gets this film some additional attention.",9,3,7,28 February 2016
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," At Least It Was Better Than the First Film
","'New Moon' continues where 'Twilight' left off. More sparkly vampires, more Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) being awkward and shy. But now, we have werewolves, too, and Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner_ becomes the most muscular teenager you've ever seen.My colleague Erin Hietpas saw the film and reported: Dakota's 'character really doesn't give her a chance to show her acting skills but I think she does a perfect job a being Jane.' Kristen Stewart, however, 'does some terrible acting in this film. I didn't know you could mumble all your lines with a blank expression and still be paid so highly.' If you drink every time Bella bites her lip, 'You'll be drunk before it's half over. If you can get past the lack of chemistry and acting from the main characters it's a good movie.' Billy Burke 'stole every scene he was in with' Stewart. 'Of course, she didn't put up much of a fight.' Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson 'are very bland on screen. You go there expecting the best meal you ever had and you end up getting white bread and water. And your bread is stale.' I went to the film opening night with a large group of people and have since seen it twice more. I agree with pretty much everything Erin said. I wouldn't say I went there 'expecting the best meal', but otherwise this sounds about right.Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film a respectable two and half stars out of four, praised Kristen Stewart's performance in the film and wrote that the movie has 'melodrama that, at times, is enough to induce diabetes'. As I write this, IMDb has the film sitting at a putrid 4.4 out of 10, one of the lowest scores I've ever seen for a new release, especially one so popular. Perhaps the target audience doesn't use the Internet? For those who went based on the preview, or want to, be warned: the trailer is grossly misleading. Pretty much all the action and suspense were fit into the trailer, meaning the bulk of the boring parts are left for you to discover on your own. There's too much romance and sap, which the girls will probably love (I would have cut at least five minutes of the 'I love you' crap put), but there's also great humor and good references for the guys dragged along to this. The fictional film 'Face Punch' had me almost falling out of the seat laughing. Horror fans!!!! There's a semi-subtle reference to 'Dawn of the Dead' and its critique of consumerism. Very odd. And even 'Pontypool', one of the year's best new horror films, gets a small cameo (look closely).The budget was obviously bigger than the first film, and I'm happy to say the budget was better used. I didn't particularly like the special effects with the wolvesÂ I mean, if 'Jurassic Park' looked more real in 1993 and 'The Thing' in 1982 looked amazingÂ why does CGI always seem to be little more than a cartoon these days? That's a mystery I want solved.Writer Melissa Rosenberg saves the day again, adding depth to the story that Meyer lacked in the book, and director Chris Weitz made a nice balance of the romance and action scenes. Listening to Weitz's commentary on the DVD reveals that he is a very talented and knowledgeable director, with an eye for (Dutch) angles. I would like to think it's not his fault this film was weak, but rather that he had little to work with.In the end, though I hate to admit it, I liked it. Not saying it's a good film â it's not â but a good time. Mark this one up as a guilty pleasure.",5,5,9,25 March 2010
Patton," Decent War Film, Immortalization of Patton
","This film essentially tells the story of General George Patton during World War II. What he does before and after is of no consequence. While some liberties are taken, the film is largely historically accurate.I think the whole feel is summed up in the opening speech from Patton: 'Men, all this stuff you've heard about America not wanting to fight, wanting to stay out of the war, is a lot of horse dung. Americans traditionally love to fight. All real Americans love the sting of battle. When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble shooter, the fastest runner, big league ball players, the toughest boxers. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans have never lost, and will never lose a war... because the very thought of losing is hateful to Americans.' I really enjoyed the idea that Patton is a sixteenth century romantic warrior stuck in the twentieth century. The planned Sicily attack in 1943 is key evidence to this. (Mysteriously, Patton cites the Athenian invasion and the leadership of Alcibiades, but it's a foolish comparison. The Athenians were decimated at Sicily, and their leader deserted them. Alcibiades began the conflict as one of the Athenian commanders, but defected to Sparta... why would Patton want to do this?) Likewise, he also has this weird concept of living in many different centuries. How much he believes it and how much it is just a way of saying that his soul is eternally tied to war, I don't know. The film portrays him as being pretty serious, which I'm skeptical about.They are dead right on one thing: Patton does not allow softness or even cooks or doctors to go without uniform. He is a great general, but his big weakness is his lack of compassion. While arrogance and confidence and hardness work well in war, they may not make a well-rounded man.",8,1,2,11 April 2010
La Grande Illusion," Definitive World War I Film
","During the First World War, two French soldiers are captured and imprisoned in a German POW camp. Several escape attempts follow until they are sent to a seemingly impenetrable fortress which seems impossible to escape from.This is regarded by critics and film historians as one of the masterpieces of French cinema and among the greatest films ever made. Orson Welles named 'La Grande Illusion' as one of the movies he would take with him 'on the ark', and even Woody Allen named it among his favorites.Director Jean Renoir uses the First World War (1914â1918) as a lens through which to examine Europe as it faces the rising specter of fascism (especially in Nazi Germany) and the impending approach of the Second World War (1939â1945). Indeed, this is what makes the film so great... Europe between the wars, especially coming from France, which is like Ground Zero for the Second World War.",8,1,2,23 January 2015
The Illusionist," I Didn't See What Others Saw, But a Great Film Just the Same
","A peasant boy grows up to become a great magician (Edward Norton). But his childhood love (Jessica Biel) is now betrothed to the crown prince (Rufus Sewell). Will the magician stand for this? Can any one man stand up against the royal family? Almost everyone I know loved this movie. Some were saying it was much better than 'The Prestige', while others would point out the cinematography (which I must agree is very nice). I guess I didn't love it as much as many other people, but I freely accept it's a great film.Jessica Biel was wonderful. Let me stress I don't expect much of her. Prior to this film, her best role was probably 'Rules of Attraction', even though she was mostly just there to be a drunk college girl. Here she is much more and her acting is quite nuanced and refined. Almost the best of the movie.The best, though, goes to Paul Giamatti, who seems to make everything he touches turn to gold. He couldn't save 'Lady in the Water' (who could?) but he was no less awesome in it. And 'Sideways'? Wow! But here, he does a very low-key acting where he doesn't have a lot of range, but seems to make the small range even more dramatic than a character with large range. Compare Rufus Sewell (the crown prince) who is an overlooked actor and has good range here. Giamatti out-acts him, even though he does considerably less.Edward Norton, always great, seems less than his best here. It's no 'Fight Club' or 'American History X'. My friend who says that this film is better than 'The Prestige' cites Norton as being better than Christian Bale. Maybe on his best days, but Norton here is nothing compared to Bale. Further, why I preferred the 'Prestige' is that it seemed more realistic and plausible to me, whereas this relies on very different magic (and is done with poor CGI). I prefer a film where I can feel I'm supposed to accept the premises.In all fairness, the two films are very different (aside from the magician thing) and shouldn't be compared. The Illusionist is a beautifully crafted film, with all the scenes framed perfectly, lit perfectly and given a texture that cannot easily be found elsewhere. If you don't watch it for a movie (even though you should) watch it for a piece of art. Really worth your time.",7,1,1,25 March 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A Slight Dip From the First, But Still Good
","The Fantastic Four learn that they are not the only super-powered beings in the universe when they square off against the powerful Silver Surfer and the planet-eating Galactus.So, I overcame my dislike of the Fantastic Four in the first film, and now I am almost ready to overcome my stronger dislike of Silver Surfer. I think he is a terrible character, but this film really focused on the tragedy of the character, echoing the tragedy of Ben Grimm in the first film. Seeing him as all-powerful but lonely? A nice touch.The film also tends to focus on the Surfer almost too much. Too little shown? Galactus. His portrayal is something of a disappointment (though I am compassionate with why he ended up how he did). And also, why did Doom come back? I am glad he did, but he plays such a small, marginal role. Nothing gets fleshed out as far as it should.This movie demands a sequel, but it will probably never get one now that Marvel is devoting every new film to the Avengers story.",6,2,3,9 May 2012
NausicaÃ¤ of the Valley of the Wind," Better Than Average Anime
","Warrior/pacifist Princess NausicaÃ¤ desperately struggles to prevent two warring nations from destroying themselves and their dying planet.Going through the IMDb Top 250, I keep thinking I have seen all the mainstream anime films, and then another one rears its head. Most I simply do not care for and I have no idea what the appeal is. One, 'Howl's Moving Castle', is actually quite good, and deserving of being on the Top 250.This film is second best, and could be worthy of the Top 250, so long as it is below 'Howl'. Now, I get that the creatures are impressive and the animation is actually quite good for 1984, but there is just something about 'Howl' that is hard to beat.",7,1,2,30 June 2015
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A Classic Tale Adapted For the Modern World
","At the close of the first Wold War, a child is born... Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt), who extraordinarily happens to be physically about seventy years old despite having a child-size body. Throughout his life, he grows younger rather than older.David Fincher just keeps growing as a director. While I'm very partial to his earlier, darker work ('Seven', 'Alien 3', etc.) his latest projects just continue to amaze with his unique sensibility and with a wonderful cast of friends and crew.There's really nothing bad that can be said about this film. The original story took place about sixty years earlier, but you would never know that... the screenwriter was so careful to make a new story while still respecting the old concept. I think F. Scott Fitzgerald would have approved.Brad Pitt was wonderful as always (here's another person who grows all the time), Cate Blanchett was enjoyable, Tilda Swinton was tolerable (I don't generally like her) and we had some nice supporting roles filled by the likes of Elias Koteas. It's no wonder this film is in the top 250 on IMDb as of this writing.I have to give special credit to the CGI crew. While I am not generally a fan, they did a great job. The 'old' Pitt was decent, but I was really impressed with the younger Pitt. He was 'Thelma and Louise' young all over again...",8,0,1,20 December 2009
Men in Black II," You Knew There Had to be a Sequel: Here It Is
","What you got with Men in Black, you get again with Men in Black 2. Jones and Smith saving the universe. And we get plenty of wasted time, because before anyone can be saved Jones must retrieve his lost memory. So, that's fun.We have the same cast, only now with more bad actors added to the good. Lara Flynn Boyle, who has never done anything remarkable since 'Twin Peaks'. Patrick Warburton, who thankfully has a small role because he's worthless outside of 'Seinfeld'. Johnny Knoxville? What has he done for me lately? David Cross returns, this time playing a geeky video store employee with a co-worker who looks a lot like Natalie Portman. I don't mean to ruin it for you, but it's not Portman: it's some unknown named Colombe Jacobsen-Derstine. But she was just as hot, so I guess it doesn't make a difference.Rosario Dawson was great, she was much better here than in 'Rent' or 'Clerks II'. Her character is similar to the opera singer character from 'The 5th Element', in a round about way. (Well, it makes sense once you've seen the movie.) Her role in the grand scheme of things is very interesting (a much better backstory than the weak first movie).I hated the talking dog (Frank). The animation of him talking was urine-poor, and there was absolutely no need for him to sing 'Who Let the Dogs Out'. Most of this country has already forgotten the Baha Men, thank goodness.I thought the product placement was bad in the first film. It's ten times worse here: Sprint, Burger King, Mountain Dew, Marlboro, Bowflex, and Twister. And I felt like the film was a subtle advertisement for 'I, Robot' with Will Smith fighting robots and aliens... even the directing looked the same (but I'm pretty sure it's not).At least one good thing came from this film: the terms 'old and busted' versus 'the new hotness'. Hurrah. Does this make you want to see the film? Then see it. But you're not missing out if you rent 'Willow' instead so you can spend more time with your kids.",5,1,2,31 August 2006
Lincoln," Do I Smell an Oscar in Spielberg's Future?
","As the Civil War continues to rage, America's president (Daniel Day-Lewis) struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield and as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves.Focusing on the passage of the 13th Amendment rather than the Civil War or any other aspect of Lincoln's life, this is a powerful film that could be seen as the epilogue to Spielberg's 'Amistad'. An epilogue that surpasses the earlier tale, no less. No other film that I am aware of (and I admit I may be simply ignorant) has put the focus on the freedom of the American slave, an event of importance almost rivaling the revolution. (Also, a story that continued long after Lincoln -- the amendment was not enacted until December 1965, and Mississippi actually held out ratification until March 16, 1995!) I think Spielberg deserves credit here for a strong direction, and I would be fully supportive of him taking the Academy Award for Best Director. His dedication to this production, from the script, to the casting, to making sure things like a watch and wallpaper were historically accurate... if the director's job is to steer the ship, I find it hard to believe anyone steered any ship better than Spielberg did here.Daniel Day-Lewis is also walking away with the Academy Award for Best Actor. Do I know what the real Lincoln's mannerisms and voice were like? Of course not. But I do know that Day-Lewis puts himself 100% into all his projects, and he certainly did that here. From 'My Left Foot' to 'Gangs of New York' to 'There Will Be Blood', Day-Lewis has proved himself to be the greatest actor of his generation. Anyone who is competing with him... well, they picked the wrong year. Denzel Washington or Joaquin Phoenix could walk away with an award if they were not up against Abraham Lincoln himself. This portrayal is the best since Henry Fonda's take on the man in 1939.The other acting nominations are more questionable. Although I would rather see Sally Field win than give the award to Helen Hunt or Anne Hathaway, to say she was 2012's best supporting actress is questionable. The same for Tommy Lee Jones. He was probably better than Alan Arkin and certainly better than Robert DeNiro, but better than Christoph Waltz? I doubt this -- he seemed to be playing himself with a wig. He stuck out like a sore thumb in the 1800s... which is too bad.This brings me to Best Picture, and I am torn on this. Spielberg, as I said, put a great deal of work into this picture and I doubt any other film required as much preparation. However, I did have some issues with it that I did not have with the other contenders. While we all know that Lincoln was assassinated, I feel like it should not have been in the film. This broke up the narrative arc, and had they cut off the story just before, as Lincoln walks away triumphant, I think that would have left a stronger mark on audiences. The last ten minutes of the film are extraneous.There is also some question as to the historical accuracy. Spielberg's Abraham Lincoln is a man who lives to end slavery, who avoids a peace offering in order to free the slaves, and who is passionate about the Thirteenth Amendment. Of course, Lincoln did push for the amendment and he did sign it and the end of slavery is his legacy. But he also supported the Fugitive Slave Act, proposed the idea of deporting all freed slaves to Haiti, and said, 'If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it.' He was a complicated man.Perhaps historian Joshua Zeitz sums it up best: 'Lincoln is not a perfect film, but it is an important film.'",8,1,4,21 January 2013
Empire Records," One Day in A Record Store With Those Kids...
","An employee steals the money from a record store's vault, with the hopes of gambling with it in Atlantic City and making it big. He fails, and the next day the store must face the reality: without the money, they will be turned into one of many chain stores where the more laid back approach to selling music just doesn't slide with those in charge. Also, this day features a visit from washed-up pop star Rex Manning.Directed by the writer and director of 'Pump Up The Volume', this film simply is not as good as 'Pump Up The Volume'. And, sadly, it's also not the best movie about people hanging out in a record store -- 'High Fidelity' is a better contender in that category. What this film does excel at is showing a store with way too many employees who do nothing (how can they possibly afford to pay these slackers) and really encapsulating what it was like to live circa 1995 (probably as much or even more so than 'Reality Bites').That is really the only selling point for this film for me. Reminding me of 1995, when music like the Gin Blossoms was cool and people dressed like they were trying to escape the 1980s but didn't know how (and ended up turning to flannel for help). Sure, we have Robin Tunney ('The Craft') and a young Liv Tyler... even Renee Zellweger. All fine actresses, but nothing worth seeing the film for if that's all you want to see.There's nothing new about the idea of trying to get a store saved from going under (or a school, or a radio station -- see 'UHF'). What makes this movie different is that the characters are just, well, weird. They sit around, don't do a lot of work, wander off for no reason, and nobody cares. The store could run more effectively with fewer employees, and the film would probably be tighter if one character was dropped (maybe Ethan Embry).Warren was by far the most entertaining part of the film for me. His hoodlum antics just made me very amused, and without him this would have been a highly dull film. Do I care about a girl's depression (which is never really explored or resolved) or another girl's acceptance to Harvard (which is barely covered) or a pill addiction (which is dealt with so minorly)? No. I am never given a reason to give half a fig. Each character is so shallow that their shallowness is almost deep in its presentation.If you need a flashback to 1995, this is a film for you. The music obviously plays a large role in this movie, and the styles will be familiar. But as far as being an outstanding film or a cultural achievement or even a cult classic, I guess I just don't see it. All the hype this film had or has circling around it don't amount to much. But, hype is like that -- almost never delivering on its promises.",6,3,6,3 August 2007
Children of Men," A Great Dystopian Vision of the Future
","By 2009, the world has become infertile. Is it pollution? Nuclear fallout? The hand of God? No one knows, but as of 2027 no child has been born and the world is falling into disarray. This movie follows one man (Theo) on his journey with Kee, a woman who may be the hope for the world's future. Will humans be born again or is this the slow end? This film is so full of social commentary, but it's done in an artistic and powerful way. Maybe not a subtle way, as they prominently feature Homeland Security, immigration crackdowns and even a man with a hood over his head forced to stand with electrodes on his hands (a now iconic image of Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq). How does the government handle crises and crack down on dissidence? Maybe not to this extreme in real life, but then again some would say this is where we're headed.Clive Owen is amazing as the everyman (albeit more a hero than most would be). Michael Caine is also good, though I think he tried too hard to be John Lennon. The character of Kee is most fascinating, and people have pointed out how her name sounds like 'key' (the key to the future of humanity) and 'chi' (an Asian word meaning, basically, 'life force'). I have to assume this was intentional, just as Theo's name must be (meaning 'god'). What's surprising to me is how well they kept the religious aspects minimized. While they are important to the plot, they're always in the background. Compare this to 'The Mist' where religious fanaticism takes center stage and become obnoxious (and it's not long before an obnoxious character makes a film itself obnoxious).Dystopian films tend to be well-made, and this is no exception. The director took great pains to get long shots filmed (some going over six minutes straight) and the use of the hand-held really added to the feeling of being embedded in a world of war and violence. Do not pass up on this one. If you only have time to see it once, make sure you see it once. But you may end up wanting to own it for repeated viewings.",8,5,11,10 February 2008
Million Dollar Baby," Clint Eastwood Shines, Hilary Swank Does Her Thing
","I'm not the biggest fan of this movie. It's like many other sports films: the underdog tries to make it big. But the beauty of this film is in Clint Eastwood. Like his later role in 'Gran Torino', he plays an older man set in his ways and somewhat prejudiced who loosens up and becomes a hero of sorts. Morgan Freeman is also great, but when isn't he? Hilary Swank is not one of my favorite actresses, but she played this role well and I cannot see anyone else doing it. Someone mentioned that Sandra Bullock (for example) would have killed this role and therefore the movie. Absolutely right.There was much to like in this one, like the featherweight who wanted to be the champion... but as well as it held my attention and was well-paced and acted, I wouldn't say it was a masterpiece. Clint Eastwood is a fine director, but for me he didn't get the power out of this one that he did with 'Torino'.",7,1,4,29 May 2010
Garden State," The Indie Film To End All Indie Films
","A quietly troubled young man (Zach Braff) returns home for his mother's funeral after being estranged from his family for a decade.This film hit a generation hard and was in no small way responsible for popularizing indie music, with the Shins in particular. Soundtracks with Shins, the Bravery and more started floating around. Thanks, Zach Braff, you single-handedly changed the music industry.Interestingly, this film features Jim Parsons before his big break. Not that his role is huge, but it is big enough that anyone watching today (2015) will recognize him as Sheldon (and probably not much else).And this was back before Natalie Portman switched from fun films to critically acclaimed work. She does both very well.",8,0,1,30 January 2015
Donnie Brasco," Depp, Madsen and Pacino... How Can This Possibly Go Wrong?
","Donnie Brasco is the true (or at least mostly true) story of FBI agent Joseph Pistone undercover in the Bonanno crime family in the early 1980s. Exactly what you expect to happen in a mafia family does happen.At first, the film was nothing special... the fact it was 'real' meant that it had some of the more sensational things I have seen in other mob movies missing. But, this is made up for in the second half when Brasco gets to the higher ranks. So, if you are bored at first... wait it out.Al Pacino is golden as always. He simply can do no wrong. Sure, you think 'Gigli' sucked (and you are not alone in thinking this) but I will tell you that he was the crown jewel of that film (even more than my man Christopher Walken). In this film, he is a little more washed up than in other roles, but still very menacing in his own way.Johnny Depp? Sure, he has made a mistake or two (I am still not sold on 'Secret Window' or some of his later work with Tim Burton), but this is not one of them. Not only is he fantastic as Brasco, his acting is convincing enough that I might not even have recognized him as Depp if I was not aware of the fact. Well played, Mr. Depp.Michael Madsen, a godsend. 'Trail of a Killer' and 'Reservoir Dogs' are both Madsen goldmines, and this is another... 'Kill Bill' a little less so. Ignore 'Free Willy', it is films like this that Madsen really shines in.Worth a watch if you like gangster films or historic films... or both, I guess. Quite a delightful piece of cinema.",8,1,2,16 August 2006
Casualties of War," Sean Penn, Enunciate
","Casualties of War is a film set in the Vietnam War. As such, I was afraid it would be redundant to watch after recently watching both 'Platoon' and 'Hamburger Hill'. In some ways, I was correct - the same themes are here about Americans terrorizing the Vietnamese and teamwork failing under pressure. But there is a difference. Back to that in a moment.This film has Michael J. Fox as a college-educated soldier in a team full of heartless, hardened soldiers. Many scenes are similar to 'Platoon', where Charlie Sheen entered the war with no experience in combat. Another parallel is with 'Full Metal Jacket', even using the whole rifle/gun dichotomy... in reverse.But where this film is different is that it does not show bits and pieces of mistreatment: it focuses on the mistreatment of one Vietnamese woman and carries it for over an hour. You never have time to escape the brutal reality of rape and torture that this film shows you. If the point was to humanize foreign peoples (in times of war or otherwise) it succeeded. This is not your 'family film'...Sean Penn is also decent as the commanding officer, a psychotic madman. He is quite believable as a controlling sadist. However, I found Penn's acting to be a bit over the top sometimes and his non-stop mumbling was very annoying for me (is that how Penn talks, or is he obsessed with playing characters who don't know how to articulate?). All in all, this film was better than I expected and not just another war movie. Also, Michael J. Fox is really short. He must be like 5'2'... Recommended.",6,2,6,23 February 2006
Event Horizon," Not Your Typical Space Horror Movie
","A doctor who designed the ship and a crew of rescuers are sent to pick up the crew from the space vessel Event Horizon, off the orbit of Neptune. What the rescuers don't know, however, is that the ship is powered by a black hole and is capable of opening portals to other planets or maybe even dimensions. What might have come through?It seems appropriate I chose to watch this after 'Snow White', the OTHER 1997 Sam Neill horror film (but he's more like the Neill from 'In the Mouth of Madness' here than the Neill from 'Snow White'). Never a bad time to catch two connected movies back to back.I can't help but compare this film to other Paul Anderson films such as 'Resident Evil' or 'Mortal Kombat'. There is a distinct look he is good at with technology and particularly the costumes. While I doubt Anderson designed the costumes, you get a sense he likes characters with jumpsuits. If I had to guess who directed this film without knowing, Anderson would be my first guess based on his scenery alone.Paul Anderson also loves the techno-industrial music in his films (Orbital, The Prodigy, KMFDM) -- he's like a more lighthearted David Fincher in this way. I grew up on industrial music, so this really works for me. But also, I see metal or more specifically industrial crucial to good horror -- to really make the point, see Charlie Clouser's contributions to 'Saw II'. The whole violence and alienation vibe that is given off by industrial is very appropriate to horror.The film in general is very likable. Sam Neill is an amazing actor, Laurence Fishbourne (after being Cowboy Curtis but before being Morpheus) is wonderful. And there's a sense of gore that is more hinted at than shown (most of the gore scenes are very quick, leaving an impression on your mind for you to create your own imagery). Many horror space movies are just really stupid (do I need to mention 'Leprechaun in Space'?) or follow the same paths, but this one really stands out as unique. It needed both the horror and space aspects to work.I could compare this to 'Doom' (the game or the movie) with the portal to Hell in space... but I won't. Or how about comparing it to 'Solaris' (George Clooney's only bad film) with the images of dead friends coming back to life? This is vastly superior, by far. Really, I can't stress enough how awful 'Solaris' is. The inclusion of the tesseract is really great. I don't think they used the word 'tesseract', but they used the idea. I grew up with 'A Wrinkle in Time' and another book about tesseracts (or, more precisely, wormholes since 'tesseract' just illustrates extra dimensions and not so much how to travel through them) and this always gets me pumped. If such things are really possible, the future will be awesome.Well, anyway, if you're looking for a horror film that's unlike all others you've seen -- but good -- this is a wise choice. Sam Neill cannot steer you wrong, and the elements needed for a good movie are in place here. It's not like the 'Citizen Kane' of horror, but maybe the 'Jurassic Park' of horror.

The Nightmare Before Christmas," Great Film, But Probably Still Overrated
","Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), king of Halloweentown, discovers Christmas Town, but does not quite understand the concept.I understand this is a modern Christmas classic, and as we approach the 20th anniversary, there will probably be a great deal of fanfare. I guess I just do not get it, though. While I enjoy the movie, love the songs (Danny Elfman is amazing) and think the animation is spectacular, it is unclear to me how it has the strong cult following it does or how it has made the Top 250 movies list.Maybe I am just rebelling because I instinctively dislike things that are popular. But I just am not clear on the mass appeal. If we consider this a Tim Burton film (and that is debatable), it is probably among his best work... but still not on the level of, say, the Batman films or 'Beetlejuice'. And those do not get the level of praise. Why?",7,0,0,27 December 2012
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Even Better Than I Dreamt
","I had heard good things about this movie. It was recommended by people I respect. It covers a topic I care deeply about (the Red Scare). It stars, is written by and is directed by George Clooney. So it had to be good. But it was better than good - it was beautiful.The film is a retelling of the 1950s from the perspective of Edward R. Murrow and his news crew, focusing on their crusade against Senator Joseph McCarthy (who lived less than 20 minutes from where I sit right now) and the persecution of alleged communists. Not to give anything away, but they won. And investigative journalism as we know it today was born (although I'd argue it is a shadow of what it used to be).The actors were all great and blended into their roles well. The actor who played Murrow (who sadly is unknown to me) was amazing. I can't really say how accurate the movie was because I didn't live in the 1950s, but I never doubted for a second that this was what went down on those fateful days.I recommend this film to anyone who likes history, politics or just a good film about the little guy against the big man. Or, anyone who likes Kent cigarettes (the scene with the cigarette ad is pretty amusing). Check it out! Though you don't have to take my word for it.",8,0,0,15 May 2006
Big Hero 6," Best Animated Film of 2014?
","The special bond that develops between plus-sized inflatable robot Baymax, and prodigy Hiro Hamada, who team up with a group of friends to form a band of high-tech heroes.As of now (January 2015), the Academy Award announcements have yet to be made. But the buzz has indicated that 'The Lego Movie' has set itself up as the animated film to beat at this year's awards. And, indeed, it is a strong contender, easily outshining 'The Boxtrolls' and edging out 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' (if only because this is a sequel).But the best film of the year is 'Big Hero 6', without a doubt. Others have called it 'well balanced', and that is the perfect way to describe why it succeeds. There is humor, there is action, there is a serious plot (with characters actually dying). It is sophisticated enough for adults, but not so dark that it would scare off children. This really has a very wide appeal.Fans of the comic book (if any exist) may be disappointed, because the book and the film have almost nothing in common beyond a few character names. Even Baymax has somehow been transformed from a dragon to a cuddly marshmallow. But perhaps the new incarnations are even better than the old ones? Especially considering how few people had ever heard of the comic book versions.",8,8,17,10 January 2015
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," By Sequel Standards, This One Is Pretty Impressive
","After Alice escapes from Umbrella Corporation's secret underground laboratory (The Hive) as seen in the first film, she stumbles into Raccoon City, which has already become overrun with people infected by the T-Virus. Umbrella Corp closes the city to leave everyone to die.First, I must confess the first film took two viewings for me to appreciate it. I watched it once and was not moved, but was very impressed the second time. This sequel caught my attention the first time. Now, sure, very little happens in it and it has some flaws, but as I say, by sequel standards it is quite good. A film series never really manages to make a great sophomore effort (with the exception of 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II'), so take each one with a grain of salt.I could debate the merits of director Alexander Witt versus Paul Anderson. Anderson still wrote this film but declined to direct, and Witt is admittedly a very inexperienced director. But he did fine... and kept the similar style that Anderson had, leaving the two movies very seamless (which is important when they run one to the other without pause).I enjoyed the subtle references to other films, like the line '10 points' that I assume to reference 'Deathrace 2000' and the line 'Finish him!' that clearly is from Anderson's previous effort, 'Mortal Kombat'. Very nice work.The Nemesis was a great creature. Not exactly like the game, but a formidable foe. The move to make him the counterpart to Alice was a good plot device and plays out well. I also liked the dogs, which are more true to the video game version. Those dogs in the game can be quite the pain in the butt. I think the way the zombies walked was perfect, exactly how zombies should. Many films get this wrong these days, not making the corpses Romeroesque enough. This movie gets it, keeping the tradition alive.It's a long tradition, too: this is a sequel to another movie ('Resident Evil') based on a video game ('Biohazard'), which was based on an older video game ('Alone in the Dark'), inspired by Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' series, which was inspired by Roger Corman's 'Last Man on Earth', which was based off of Richard Matheson's 'I Am Legend'.I disliked the fast movements by the people and the fast camera work that went with it. Many times things happened too fast to really see what was going on, and I found this to be a real setback. I don't recall the first film doing this (another Witt/Anderson difference?) and it seemed very strangely paced for a horror film (though maybe properly paced for an action film).The geeky guys get the ladies: Milla Jovovich returns as Alice, which is crucial since geeky guys are obsessed with Milla and have been ever since 'The 5th Element'. They also now have their Jill Valentine, the darling of the 'Resident Evil' games. The film creators did a great job keeping the costume for Jill very close to the game, though I think the actress could have looked more similar. (And in the third film we have Ali Larter as Claire Redfield, which is an even bigger stretch.) As you can probably tell, I endorse this film. While I think Paul Anderson would have made a better sequel than Witt did, that's just being nitpicky. For what we were given, we have a great package and a respectable bridge between the first and third films.",7,1,3,11 December 2006
Mulholland Drive," Twin Peaks Continued... Sort Of
","After a car wreck on the winding Mulholland Drive renders a woman (Laura Harring) amnesiac, she and a perky Hollywood-hopeful (Naomi Watts) search for clues and answers across Los Angeles in a twisting venture beyond dreams and reality.So this is what would have happened to Audrey if 'Twin Peaks' was allowed to continue? Odd. And how will that play into the return of 'Twin Peaks' in 2016? It probably will not, but who knows? These worlds are clearly not far apart. Even Angelo Badalamenti's score is reminiscent of his 'Peaks' work.But then, Club Silencio is a return to 'Blue Velvet' in a sense. Or even all the way back to the woman in the radiator in 'Eraserhead'. David Lynch may be odd, but he is consistent.",8,0,2,30 January 2015
Grave of the Fireflies," Greatest War Film?
","A tragic film covering a young boy and his little sister's struggle to survive in Japan during World War II.Apparently people, including Roger Ebert, consider this one of the greatest -- or perhaps the greatest -- war film ever made. Now, that is interesting because it is a cartoon. You never expect that, and this might not be something you want to show kids. It is pretty bold, with wounded people, maggots, and anyone can die.Even more interesting is how it takes place from the point of view of a Japanese youth during World War II. He is not nationalistic, he is not anti-American, he is just a kid. And is that not the truth of war? No matter who is right or wrong, millions of kids become the victims.",8,3,4,17 December 2014
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made
","Set during World War II, a story seen through the innocent eyes of Bruno (Asa Butterfield), the eight-year-old son of the commandant (Professor Lupin) at a concentration camp, whose forbidden friendship with a Jewish boy on the other side of the camp fence has startling and unexpected consequences.I was a little slow warming up to this film. First, I was a bit put off by the fact the Germans were all obviously British with British accents. Perhaps having actual German actors might have made more sense (even if they spoke English). And then I found Bruno hard to relate to because he just seemed completely naive. Maybe I was not giving him enough credit, but either way, he charmed me over halfway in.The way this film twists, turns, remains unpredictable, and handles ark, adult subject matter in a way that is (mostly) appropriate for children... it is beautiful and sad, perfect and tragic. I was impressed beginning to end, and it is no surprise that Asa Butterfield has become a go-to child actor for 'Hugo' and 'Ender's Game'.",9,1,3,28 November 2012
Brave," A More or Less Average Film
","Determined to make her own path in life, Princess Merida defies a custom that brings chaos to her kingdom. Granted one wish, Merida must rely on her bravery and her archery skills to undo a beastly curse.The people who select the Golden Globes winners... something is very, very wrong with them. Somehow this film became the winner of the Golden Globe for animation. Now, maybe the vote was split on two others and this one sneaked through... but I think somehow they thought it was the best. It is anything but.Having now seen the five Oscar nominees for best animated feature, I sincerely hope this film does not walk away with the award. While it has a strong feminist message that may appeal to young women (which is good), the overall plot is your standard Disney story: girl gets in disagreement with parents and rebels, has to learn that she was wrong. We saw this in 'Little Mermaid', to some degree in 'Beauty and the Beast'... it is nothing new.The animation is well done, that is true. But even if we judge the film only on technical merits, it would have to compete with the other nominees. Add in actual plot and a level of innovation and fun, and this one is nothing -- 'ParaNorman' and 'Wreck-It Ralph' are clearly better films, and even 'Pirates' is probably the greater contribution to cinema.The title and concept are confusing. Being called 'Brave' and taking place in Scotland made me think it was a Disney version of 'Braveheart'. No. Not even close. The plot says she has to use her bravery and archery... well, sort of. But it is not actually an important aspect of the story.This is a film you can play for your kids if you want the television to babysit them. But it is not a new Disney classic by any means.",6,1,3,11 February 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," A Special Effects Mess and ADHD Editing, But Funny
","A group of intergalactic criminals are forced to work together to stop a fanatical warrior from taking control of the universe.Call me an apostate or what you will, but I do not think this is the 'greatest superhero film ever made' or any of the other hyperbole going around. Is it a good story? Heck yes. Is it funny? Heck yes. And are the characters interesting? Heck yes. But it is also overshadowed by some mind-numbing special effects and lightning-fast editing that could be done without.Not to say this is a bad movie. It is not. At all. Among the Marvel films made so far, it is probably slightly better than average. Not quite on the level of the 'Iron Man' movies, and definitely not as clever as the second 'Captain America', but far, far ahead of the disappointment that was 'Thor: The Dark World' (though, to be fair, Thor is a bad character to begin with).",7,0,5,31 January 2015
The Imitation Game," Amazing Storytelling
","During World War II, mathematician Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) tries to crack the enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians.Some people have complained about the accuracy of this film, particularly that the Poles are not given the credit they deserve. That is fair, but the bottom line is that you have to sacrifice 100% accuracy in order to make for a good story. And this is a very good story, full of moral ambiguity. A philosophy class could have a field day with how many ethical issues are presented: the war, hiding the code, destroying records, chemical castration...Cumberbatch did a superb job and if he was not already on people's radars, this will put him there. In a year with Eddie Redmayne doing a spot-on Stephen Hawking and an incredible buzz around Michale Keaton (for some unclear reason), this is not an Oscar year for him. But as a whole, this seems a real contender for Best Picture, or at the least Best Screenplay.",9,2,6,2 February 2015
Caddyshack," Classic Modern Comedy
","An exclusive golf course has to deal with a brash new member and a destructive dancing gopher.At age 30, I have finally seen 'Caddyshack'. Growing up in the age of cable, I think it could be found on one channel or another almost every day. Other people my age have likely seen the film, or at least parts of it, at least a dozen times -- maybe fifty. And now I join the ranks, though I have no interest to make repeat viewings a habit.That might sound like I did not like it. On the contrary, it actually exceeded my expectations by quite a bit. I thought it would be dated and no longer great, but quite the opposite. Chevy Chase is in top form here, and looks great -- especially now that I am used to seeing him on 'Community'. Bill Murray is pretty much always great, and this is no exception. I was never a fan of Rodney Dangerfield (though my dad is) and here he impressed me. All in all, pretty great.The only part I did not understand was Danny's attraction to Maggie, the Scottish waitress. She has a mullet, is only average looking, has an odd voice... and then, when her pants come off, she has the worst granny panties. She is hiding nothing good under those clothes! I do not blame him at all for being attracted to the rich niece.",7,1,3,11 May 2011
The Evil Dead," A Film Student's Dream
","Five friends travel to a cabin in the woods, where they unknowingly release flesh-possessing demons.While I am not going to dispute the greatness of this film, and I would not deny it is a modern horror classic (among the very best of the 1980s), I find that the best way to critique the film is as though I was watching it at the time.At the time, Fangoria wrote that the film 'might be the exception to the usual run of low-budget horror films.' They were right. Watching it as though it had just come out gives you that feeling that these guys (none of whom were known at the time) really brought something new to the table. Stephen King saw it, the horror community saw it, and there it was.And you have to give Raimi and friends credit. This was ultimately a gamble. Sure, they made a test version ('Within the Woods'), but here they laid it on the line and maxed out their credit to see their dream work (not unlike Kevin Smith and 'Clerks' a decade later). It could have flopped, and they could have spent the rest of their lives waiting tables to pay off their debts. I think they deserve credit for that.But there is another way to see the film, and that is through the lens of thirty-plus years. In retrospect, the film holds up well with critics. Martyn Glanville says it is 'one of the great modern horror films, an even more impressive when one considers its modest production values.' True. And yet, I feel like it has lost a bit of something.There will always be an 'Evil Dead' versus 'Evil Dead 2' debate, and while the atmosphere of the first is more dark and horrific, the second has a good pace, equal or better effects and a ramped-up sense of humor that has made it the bigger film... and done in such a way where you can watch it without seeing the original, perhaps making the first film obsolete. Throw on the franchise addition of 'Army of Darkness' and now the 2013 remake, and the brand might have lost its luster (just a tad).What is perhaps most interesting is the cultural impact the film had, even for those who never actually watched it and probably never will. Bruce Campbell launched a successful acting career (and an almost stalkerish legion of fans), Raimi made other great movies and was given the Spider-Man franchise. And then you have the Coen brothers, who got their start on this picture in the editing department. Few directors have had a bigger impact on film over the last few decades than the Coens. And they have this film to thank for that.So, for me, I recognize 'Evil Dead' as the classic (both ult and otherwise) that it is, despite my preference for the sequel. Where I really see the film's strength is not in its horror, though, but as a homework assignment for film students -- any cinematographer who does not learn a trick or two from Raimi is not even trying. The angles, the zooms, the colors...",8,1,5,6 April 2013
Shrek 2," I Liked This Better Than Shrek One (So Sue Me!)
","Shrek and Fiona travel to meet Fiona's parents, who are less than thrilled that Fiona has married an ogre (though they seem to ignore the fact she has turned into one). The King devises a plan with the Fairy Godmother to get Fiona to leave Shrek for Prince Charming (which seems brilliant if we ignore all the laws about marriage, possibly inapplicable in the fairy world). Shrek won't sit back and let Charming steal his bride, though. Heck no.I liked this movie better than the first one. It was another great combination of humor, adventure and romance. I found the humor much funnier and more consistent this time, really pandering to the adults. The catnip joke and the subtle use of the word 'pussy' (related to Puss in Boots) are noteworthy. The movie was fast-paced and ended so fast, it could have been much longer, whereas the first film needed more time for character development.My favorite aspect was that Eddie Murphy's character wasn't played up as much, meaning less abrasive shouting in this film. No offense to Murphy, but he is annoying and I really didn't need him in the movie at all. Giving him the back seat he had this time was an improvement. If only 'Shrek 3' had him removed.I watched this with a 5-year old child, who loved Puss in Boots. Personally, I love the Gingerbread Man the best. And I think this movie has that going for it: almost everyone should be able to find a character that stands out for them. Besides the child, I watched the movie with three other adults who all loved the movie.I also enjoyed the Shrek = black man element. Much of this was like 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' and that's always an important message (that racism is stupid). Has this been overdone? Yes. But this is an animated sequel, cut them some slack. Compared to the sequels Disney pumps out (like 'Little Mermaid 2') this was like the movie of the year.The American Idol scene ruined the movie for me, but I was able to block it out for the most part and hopefully will some day forget it entirely. Ignoring that, this movie is a charmer and very spectacular. See this, even if you have no kids.",8,0,1,17 December 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," File Under 'Things That Quentin Tarantino Knows How To Do'
","There should be a list of things Quentin Tarantino knows how to do, and a list of things he clearly does not. Perhaps if he examined this list, he wouldn't make any mistakes in the future. The one thing Tarantino should definitely not be doing is getting involved with any horror films. 'Hostel', while not awful, was talked up way too much. And his endorsement for 'Wolf Creek'? I have no idea what he was on to make him think it was a stellar flick.But the list of things he can do well is much longer and we see most of those things in 'Kill Bill'. This is the story of a retired assassin who is attacked on her wedding day, and the entire wedding party is killed. When she wakes up from her coma, she decides to take revenge on the man who did this to her: Bill. Yes, she will kill Bill. Or at least die trying.Things Tarantino does very well: 1. Puts scenes in the wrong order. In 'Kill Bill', they don't even show her killing her enemies in the correct order. He mastered this in 'Pulp Fiction' after testing it in 'Reservoir Dogs', but 'Kill Bill' really drives home how effective a film can be if you put things in a more climatic order.2. Incidental dialog. Some people, like Richard Linklater or Kevin Smith, can make an entire film of incidental dialog, thus making the dialog essential and not really incidental. Tarantino only puts a pinch here or there, to flavor the film with off-hand cultural references. Remember the Royale with Cheese from 'Pulp Fiction'? You'll find more of that here.3. Senseless violence. If you liked the killings in the other films, you'll love this. The killing is gorier, the body count higher. And the influence of old kung fu films is a nice touch. Personally, I'm a big fan of the blood geysers.4. Music selection. Music played a central role in 'Reservoir Dogs' (K-Billy's Sounds of the 70s). Again, the music is crucial, giving the film an old-timey feel (with 'Green Hornet' music, among others). This is very well done, mixing the classic (sword fighting) with the modern (guns).5. Putting people in suits. I can't explain why, but the suits worn in Tarantino films are the best.6. Understanding your traditions. This film references so many more old kung fu films tan I will ever see. Tarantino knows his stuff and sprinkles references all over that most people will never understand. A prominent character, Hattori Hanzo, is actually a real character from other sources and even some of the dialog is a throw-back. This homage is touching and well done.What I'm saying is that if you liked Tarantino before, I suspect you'll be a big fan of this movie. It's dirtier, gorier and more violent. Some scenes are much more crude than in his other films. But Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman are a winning combination, not to mention the flawless Michael Madsen and a well-casted David Carradine.",8,0,3,14 September 2006
Saw II," The Only Saw Sequel That Really Holds Up
","Jigsaw is up to his old tricks again, this time trapping several people in a house, and leaving them various clues to get out. Unfortunately for them, they have been given a nerve gas and they have a limited amount of time before they will expire.The DVD features commentary with director Darren Lynn Bousman and actors Donnie Walhberg and Beverly Mitchell, with Darren and Donnie constantly talking about how hot and sexy Emmanuelle Vaugier is.Shawnee Smith is four months pregnant in this film. Jigsaw's clue of 'over the rainbow' was the key to solving he safe combination: putting the numbers in the order of the rainbow colors...With the needle trap, over 100,000 needles had to be opened and safetyed. Bousman says there are three homages to 'Last House on the Left' in the film. The gas is based on a real nerve gas that kills you in twenty to thirty minutes, and so even though the crew actually designed more traps than were shown in the film, it just didn't work out.Darren and Beverly say they had 'great craft service', which kept James Wan stopping back to the set The closing credits with Mudvayne ('Forget to Remember') are just one part of a great soundtrack.",7,0,1,29 November 2010
Ip Man," Brings To Light A Little-Known Historical Figure
","A semi-biographical account of Yip Man (Donnie Yen), the first martial arts master to teach the Chinese martial art of Wing Chun.Outside of martial arts fans, the name 'Ip Man' may not mean much to Americans. In fact, the title sounds silly, as though this was a superhero alongside Batman and Superman. But perhaps this is a sign that the film's time has come: more people, including Americans, ought to know about this martial arts legend, the man who trained Bruce Lee.Derek Elley of Variety Magazine wrote in his review, 'Yen, who's taking on real star charisma in middle age, is aces as Ip, with a simple dignity that exactly mirrors the movie's own and a gracefulness in combat that's very different from his trademark whiplash style.' Elley is exactly right. Donnie Yen is really making a name for himself with the 'Ip Man' films and is now a very marketable entity. Few martial arts stars today can claim similar status.",7,0,0,2 December 2014
From Dusk Till Dawn," Rodriguez and Tarantino
","Two criminals (Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney) and their hostages unknowingly seek temporary refuge in an establishment populated by vampires, with chaotic results.I believe this was the film that really cemented the Tarantino-Rodriguez connection. Tarantino writes and stars, with Rodriguez directing. Their combined influence is noticeable -- the dialogue is very much Tarantino, whereas the more Texan / Mexican influence is certainly Rodriguez (not to mention the casting of Danny Trejo).Aside from some cheesy special effects with the transformations, this is a pretty good horror-crime-action flick, and has rightly become something of a modern classic.",7,1,3,8 June 2015

","He was the Lord of Ten Thousand Years, the absolute monarch of China. He was born to rule a world of ancient tradition. Nothing prepared him for our world of change.This is a beautiful film. It looks great, with the scenery and costumes, and they were able to film in the Forbidden City, which is something of a small miracle. (It has the unfortunate side effect of taking some of the mystery out of the City, but that is a whole other thing.) Now, my knowledge of Chinese history is pretty sparse. Other than things like their involvement in the Korean War, I am rather ignorant. I really had no idea that they had an emperor as long as they did... and the level of respect for a two-year old?

He has made some great films, some real blockbusters. He brings in the money. And, shockingly, he has gotten two Oscar nominations (I think maybe even for this film). But seriously, he is not good. He just happens to be in good films... with rare exception (maybe 'Magnolia'?) when have you actually seen him act? This is a good film. Not a great one, but a good one.

The Big Blue," Luc Besson Looks Beautiful
","Enzo (Jean Reno) and Jacques (Jean-Marc Barr) have known each other for a long time. Their friendship started in their childhood days in the Mediterranean. They were not real friends in these days, but there was something they both loved and used to do the whole day long: diving.Luc Besson makes some beautiful films, and tends to push the imagery into the realm of fantasy. This is a much more down to earth film, focusing on two divers who are more or less based on actual people. A straight telling of the story makes fantasy less likely, but it does not mean Besson strays from his imagery. The colors (or lack thereof) are as strong as ever, and he knows that one of the ways to make diving fascinating is to focus on the fish.Somehow one of the Arquette sisters ends up in the movie, which is neither good not bad. Just odd for what presents itself as a French-Italian film.",7,0,1,27 May 2015
Jurassic World," An Improvement Over Part Three
","A new theme park is built on the original site of Jurassic Park. Everything is going well until the park's newest attraction -- a genetically modified giant stealth killing machine -- escapes containment and goes on a killing spree.This film was going through various stages of development since at least 2003, and who knows how many changes were made in the process. Keira Knightley dropped out, Chris Pratt became the lead actor (something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago) and a virtual unknown was given the director's chair.Typically, by the fourth film in a franchise, the budget is smaller and the film ends up going straight to video. Instead, someone decided to make this the big comeback, and it pays off. Maybe not as good as the original, and arguably a notch below part two, this film easily outdoes part three and made a ton of money in the process.Credit should be given for not doing a 'reboot' or 'remake'. Although it still confounds me that anyone would try (and succeed) in building a theme park, it works in the storyline. And even though they did not have Malcolm, Grant or pretty much any other main character return, they brought back Dr. Wu (this time a bit more sinister). That was a great choice, and keeps the franchise strong. How a part five is possible, who knows, but it seems bound to happen now.",6,6,17,19 July 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Not as Bad as I Expected
","A young boy (Freddie Highmore) wins a tour through the most magnificent chocolate factory in the world, led by the world's most unusual candy maker (Johnny Depp).The biggest way this film differs from the original: Tim Burton (or someone) wrote it so the story has a weird obsession with Wonka's childhood. Now, this has some advantages, such as getting a role for Christopher Lee and being able to explain the importance of family, but it does seem to ruin the flow at times.I liked the new songs. We have a new style of Oompa-Loompa, and they have a variety of musical styles. Excellent. Especially considering how much Danny Elfman was involved.In some ways, this is closer to the play than the original film, especially with the nut scene. I do not recall how the book goes, but I suspect it may also have the nut scene. All in all, for a movie that is greatly disparaged, this is not nearly as bad as it is made out to be.",6,2,3,23 December 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," Good Concept, Imperfect Execution
","The affair between a politician (Matt Damon) and a ballerina (Emily Blunt) is affected by mysterious forces keeping the lovers apart.I liked how this film reminded me of 'Dark City', though not nearly as dark and menacing, with the theme of manipulation behind the scenes of reality. Many have noticed the similarity between the beings here and what could be seen as angels and their work for God. Was this intentional? Probably.Roger Ebert called it 'a smart and good movie that could have been a great one, if it had been a little more daring. I suspect the filmmakers were reluctant to follow its implications too far.' Not only that, but the film relies heavily on a cheesy romance plot. Who cares if these two get together or if it defies what 'should' be?",7,0,1,13 February 2014
Black Snake Moan," A Movie Unlike Which You've Ever Seen
","After her boyfriend leaves for the military, Rae (Christina Ricci) goes out for a night of partying and has a little bit too much fun. Beaten and left for dead on the side of the road, she is taken in by Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), whose wife has just left him. Together, they will overcome their losses.I walked into this movie knowing practically nothing about it. I had seen the trailer with Jackson hauling Ricci around with a large chain. I like Jackson, I really love Ricci (I've been a fan as far back as 'Casper')... and I like chains. It seemed like a good idea for a film. I got Ricci, Jackson and the chain... but not in the ways I expected. A religious Jackson? A movie with strong blues overtones? Not expected at all.But I don't mean to say that by unexpected it was bad. Definitely not. This might be Jackson's best acting ever (Kevin Smith says it's the best since 'Pulp Fiction', but personally I think he was better here). And Ricci really does a fine job. I think many people will go to see her naked through much of the film, but she really does play a strong role and a strong character. Even Justin Timberlake, who I had low expectations of, was decent. When he got violent, his ability to channel himself was pretty darned impressive.This film comes across as 'independent' in the best possible way. A fresh idea, the courage to push the lines of appropriateness (though thankfully not as far as 'The Brown Bunny'). And it was more artistic than entertaining (which many won't like, but it's a better, richer film in many ways).Great film, great acting, great cinematography. I also loved the music -- Jackson learned to play the blues and I think he plays a pretty mean blues in this film (with his trademark potty mouth, of course). Many won't like this movie, most will probably not understand it, but expect it to return around Oscar time next year. Great, great movie.",8,3,6,15 March 2007
A Bug's Life," Pixar Does Ants
","A misfit ant (Dave Foley), looking for 'warriors' to save his colony from greedy grasshoppers, recruits a group of bugs that turn out to be an inept circus troupe.At the time this came out, it was probably a big hit. And they certainly got a wide selection of interesting voices. But now (2015) it no longer really has that charm. The message of non-conformity is still good and not letting yourself get pushed around, but the animation is just so standard for Pixar that the wow factor no longer applies.I think I heard a rumor there is a 'Bug's Life 2' on the horizon. If there is, I will no doubt watch it. And perhaps like 'Toy Story', the sequel will be even better. But it might take a little work.",6,0,0,6 April 2015
Prisoners," Intense Abduction Thriller
","When Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman)'s daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads and the pressure mounts. But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family? Canadian director Denis Villeneuve had been making films for years, but probably achieved his biggest success with 'Incendies' (2010), getting recognized by the Academy for a foreign film. This was his followup, a much more commercial venture, and probably even more widely seen. Somehow, despite the great performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Jackman, the only nomination it got was for Roger Deakins' cinematography (which is a given -- as of 2015, he has had 12 nominations).Christopher Orr wrote, 'Ethical exploration or exploitation? In the end, I come down reservedly on the former side: the work done here by Jackman, Gyllenhaal, and especially Villeneuve is simply too powerful to ignore.' He does raise a good point, however, about the thin line. The violence is intense, and understandably earned the film an NC-17. But is it justified to show this level of violence in order to explain the characters? Perhaps.",7,1,2,1 July 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Good Film Ruined by Awful Effects
","When Tony Stark and Bruce Banner try to jump-start a dormant peacekeeping program called Ultron, things go horribly wrong and it's up to Earth's Mightiest Heroes to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.I may be in the minority, but I think the effects on this film look awful. When the heroes are standing still and the background is altered to make it look better, this is pulled off okay. But any time there is movement, it looks just ridiculously bad. Chases, fighting, and even the Hulk are very silly. How can this be acceptable? The inclusion of Quicksilver also seems to have been a big mistake. I understand why he was needed, but it did not have to be that way. If we had just focused on a good story (like the last 'Captain America') this would have been better. I will give them bonus points for introducing Klaw, though... perhaps he will return in 'Black Panther'?",6,1,14,13 March 2016
Hotel Transylvania," Quite Funny
","Dracula, who operates a high-end resort away from the human world, goes into overprotective mode when a boy discovers the resort and falls for the count's teen-aged daughter.As far as plots go, this one is pretty simple and not all that deep or clever. The characters are also not that deep. Often, this will take away from a film (or completely ruin it, like it did for 'The Good Dinosaur'). But this was also a very funny movie, and that more than made up for it.I confess that I was hesitant about it being a film coming out of the 'Adam Sandler camp'. It seems Sandler has more misses than hits these days, but this was clearly a hit. Funny for both adults and children, great use of characters to drive the humor home. I wasn't super-crazy about Andy Samberg's character (who sounded like Steve Zahn), but it wasn't a deal-breaker.",7,3,4,25 April 2016
The Insider," An Example for Future Films
","This film, like 'Good Night and Good Luck', sends a clear message to me and hopefully to movie makers everywhere: we need more movies highlighting social and political issues, and we need more media outlets with some integrity.This film, directed by Michael Mann ('Miami Vice'), has given me a new respect for Mann and also for Russell Crowe, who I thought was not good for much besides getting sweaty and punching people. Crowe is a winner here, and alongside Al Pacino (who can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned) we have a dynamic duo on par with Batman and Robin.The story is of a tobacco executive (Crowe) who turns against his former employer with the help of a media producer (Pacino). With lawsuits a death threats the tobacco industry tries to stop them. I was not sure how the film was going to end because it keeps twisting and turning and although the true story did not happen long ago it was not one I was familiar with.I'm not going to critique the music or the directing or the acting or any other aspect of this film, other than to say it was excellent. The film was a bit on the long side, but this was not a bad quality in any way. I never felt a scene was wasted and the pacing was good enough to keep me engrossed. I admit I should have been sleeping for work but this movie held me to my screen.The Pepsi girl was in this film... who is almost as creepy as the Welch's grape juice girl. I don't know why I feel the need to mention that, but I do. Someday when I can't remember those commercials any more I will probably appreciate this actress more.Anyway, great film. See it.",9,4,7,21 July 2006
Quiz Show," A Great Dramatic Telling of a Classic American Scandal
","Herb Stempel (John Turturro) is America's everyman, with the exception that he knows everything. The star of 'Twenty One', he is asked to take a dive in exchange for a new contestant -- a more handsome Gentile with a notable family. He does take the dive, but soon regrets it and calls the local district attorney to investigate. Next, Congress gets involved and things snowball from there.Based on a true story, this was well before my time (1957-1959). But the idea is timeless... a heroic Congressional staffer who stands up to power to keep things honest for the American people. America needs more idealists like Dick Goodwin. And the story, which sells itself, is made even better with this stellar cast: John Turturro, a grossly under-rated actor playing Herb. Ralph Fiennes as Charles VanDoren. Dick Goodwin played by Rob Morrow (Joel Fleischman on 'Northern Exposure'), whose name is unfortunately not well known in film -- he really grabs the reins of this picture. Hank Azaria also appears, and Robert Redford directs. Martin Scorsese, Calista Flockhart and Ethan Hawke cameo.I've seen some complaints that the historical accuracy is a bit off on this one, but as near and I can tell it's about 95% right. And, folks, it's a movie. Entertainment. As Redford observes, if it was to be 100% accurate, he'd make a documentary and not a drama. Certainly there's some irony to all this -- a film accused of distorting the truth for entertainment being about a game show distorting the truth for entertainment. But, you know, I never felt deceived -- anyone who enters a movie 'based on a true story' who expects perfection is grossly naive.I could go on and say how well-done the sets and costumes were for making this appear appropriate to the time, or how much I enjoyed the portrayal of VanDoren's father. But the important part is this: the film was nominated for multiple Oscars, and this is one case where it deserved to win the ones it was nominated for. A powerful film -- engaging, dramatic and suspenseful. Like 'The Insider' or 'Thank You For Smoking' for the entertainment industry, a far less obvious sinister force than Big Tobacco.",8,0,0,15 July 2008
Major League," Classic Comedy
","The new owner of the Cleveland Indians puts together a purposely horrible team so they will lose and she can move the team. But when the plot is uncovered, they start winning just to spite her.While this is not the funniest movie or the most cleverly plot (it is actually very formulaic), it works. This is the sort of film that cable TV can play almost every day and people will sit and watch it. They love Wild Thing, they love the young Wesley Snipes.I sort of like the younger Corbin Bernsen. After his movie career, he had a resurgence thanks o his supporting role on 'Psych'. It is fun to go back and see him twenty years ago, before he got old enough to play a retired cop!",7,1,2,5 November 2015
The Dark Knight," About as Perfect as a Batman Film Could Ever Be
","After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).There's little use in writing a review of 'The Dark Knight' -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The 'Bat-Sonar' was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see 'Batman Begins' and 'The Prestige'). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancÃ© fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his 'A' game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre.",9,9,19,5 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," My Least Favorite Up To This Point, Maybe Overall
","With their warning about Lord Voldemort's return scoffed at, Harry and Dumbledore are targeted by the Wizard authorities as an authoritarian bureaucrat slowly seizes power at Hogwarts.At this point in the series, the story takes a decidedly darker and more sinister turn. This could be because of the subject matter: the students spend less time in class and more time preparing for real world evil. It could also be the introduction of a new crew. Not only has the director changed (again) but the screenplay has a new hand, making the very feel somewhat off. I have not read the books, but I get the impression a great deal was left out to account for time and to make the plot run smoother.The best addition to this film from previously ones is Luna Lovegood. She was apparently in the books for a while as a minor character but did not come on to the movies until now. Her role is fairly small, but important, and her character adds the one bit of lightness to this script (aside from possibly the Weasley's pranks). They cast the perfect actress.What really stands out about this film is how political it is. Parallels could be made between this and the rise of fascism or McCarthyism. There is talk of order, obedience, conformity, the need for a government to have a firm hand and to protect its own butt when damaging information comes to light. We know from the previous film that Voldemort is back, and the Ministry of Magic likely knows it, too. But they go out of their way to deny this and blame other people for terrible acts that have occurred. This political act of protecting a reputation slows down the process of preparing for Voldemort and stands in the way of clearing Sirius Black's name. The outcome could have been much improved and lives could have been spared if the government was simply honest.I believe this to be the weakest film up to this point. I did not care for the shift in spirit (the opening seemed more like a drama than a fantasy film). And i did not like feeling like parts were missing. The plot was almost made too simply, especially compared to prior episodes where mysteries had to be solved. There was no twist or surprise here, just a throwaway film to get you to the next one.",6,3,3,2 May 2011
Into the Wild," Not Clear on the Hype, But Not a Bad Film
","After graduating from Emory University, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) abandons his possessions, gives his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhikes to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters that shape his life.The casting deserves mention. Jena Malone as the sister (and narrator) was the wisest decision made on this film. Malone really needs to be in more films, and this was a shining moment for her. Kristen Stewart, on the other hand, needs to be in fewer films, and it defies logic that she somehow beat others at audition.Vince Vaughn, Zach Galifianakis and a handful of others bring some star power to this (with all due respect to Emile Hirsch, he is not a household name). Their roles are small but effective. Great job. The Eddie Vedder soundtrack -- do we need two hours of Vedder? No. But we get it just the same.Although the film gets better as it goes (deeper 'in to the wild'), its popularity and high praise are something of a mystery. If anything, it seems to have grown in stature since its first release. Why? While interesting, it never really gets to the meat of its subject. Why rejecting society and civilization was the right decision. Assuming, of course, it was... which is debatable.",7,0,2,12 December 2014
Annie Hall," Considered Allen's Best Film, I Personally Disagree
","Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) recounts his love life and how he failed with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). This film is generally considered to be somewhat autobiographical, though only to a certain extent.This film has a lot of strengths. Appearances from Jeff Goldblum, Marshall McLuhan, and Christopher Walken... some cartoon work, some breaking of the fourth wall. Interesting subtitles. Allen used every gimmick available to make this film unique, and it won him some Oscars.Personally, for me, I don't know... I like many of the jokes, but the material just doesn't touch me. I found the humor in 'Love and Death' a lot more witty. Relationships are complicated and Allen sure does make light of many of the serious things that fail a relationship. But I don't know, not my film.Despite this, I would still encourage you to see it. I think 'Love and Death' or 'Sleeper' are funnier, but 'Annie Hall' has a seriousness to it that shows a more mature side of Woody Allen that was probably absent up to this point.",7,1,2,27 April 2010
Green Street Hooligans," An American in England
","After getting kicked out of school for a drug offense that he didn't commit, a young journalist (Elijah Wood) goes to England to visit his sister (Claire Forlani) and her husband. Soon, he gets sucked into football (Soccer) culture and joins a firm (basically a gang)... which leads to violence and possible death. But worse yet, his own crew hates journalists, so if they find his secret, he's a dead man anyway.Before I saw this film, I didn't know anything about it, and feared it was a soccer film. Not that a soccer film would be bad, but I'm not a sports person. Yet, there's pretty much no soccer in here at all -- maybe not even five minutes. The focus is more on family ties, family legacies and rivalries that are based on pride rather than substance. Despite Elijah Wood being a generally weak actor, this works well.That's really all I want to say about that. The film is worth watching... lots of conflict, emotions and violence. And I would say that for the most part, it explores themes and situations that are largely new and untouched. That's hard to say about many films, but this one is one of a kind.",7,0,1,10 June 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," Visually Stunning, But Perhaps Overrated
","Humanity finds a mysterious, obviously artificial, object buried beneath the Lunar surface and, with the intelligent computer H.A.L. 9000, sets off on a quest.Saying that '2001' is overrated is the sort of statement that can bring down hatred and vitriol from science fiction fans, Kubrick fans and more. Of course, it is possible to be a Kubrick fan and still generally dislike this film.Nobody can deny that this film is visually stunning, and a landmark in imagery. It also has the advantage of being the last film about space travel to be released before the moon landing, making it somewhat prescient in a way.But yet, does it need to be so long, so grand, with the music and long shots? Perhaps not quite 'pretentious', but the film presents itself as being more important than it really is. Critics at the time (1968) denounced the film, and perhaps they were right. At the very least, two cuts could be made: a longer one for die-hard fans, and a shorter one for casual viewers.",6,5,10,1 December 2014
Blood Diamond," Ripped From the Headlines, the Nearly True Story of Diamonds
","In Sierra Leone, there exists diamonds worth a fair amount of money. But they are harvested by slaves and sold to fund genocide. This is the story of one of those slaves, a diamond smuggler (with connections to Belgium, England, And Liberia) and a journalist. Together, they will fight to win a story, a diamond and a family. But sacrifices will be made.We have an amazing cast, so let me just get them out of the way -- Leonardo DiCaprio as smuggler Danny Archer, Djimon Hounsou as native African Solomon Vandy and Jennifer Connelly as journalist Maddy Bowen. DiCaprio rarely makes bad films, and my unending praise for Connelly is seen in a variety of reviews I've written... this film will be no exception to her glowing track record.This film has action, suspense and a good story to tell. Like 'The Insider' (or whatever the tobacco movie is called), this exposes how diamonds come to be on the market. I'd like to say things have improved since the time period shown here (1990s) but I don't know if I believe that. I appreciate the honest portrayal here, not shying away from the violence or the horrible conditions the children go through. Humor is absent, and even romance (which would be so easy to add in) is never at the front of the story.I don't know how to sell this film other than that: if you care about world events, or care about the fate of innocent people ,you'll care about this movie. Even if you don't want this to be that heavy and just take it as entertainment (which it is on some levels), I think you'll still enjoy it (Jennifer Connelly!). Wish I could say more, but it's a cut and dry case: great movie, worth seeing, check it out.",8,3,4,29 August 2007
Men in Black," Happy Commercial Film, Maybe Too Mainstream For Me
","Call me an elitist, or a movie snob or whatever... but when films are as big as 'Men in Black' and are popular for no other reason than because they were marketed to death... I'm not going to run to my theater or video store. I think the fact it took me nine years to see this film would probably suggest that.The film stars Tommy Lee Jones as a man-in-black and Will Smith as a New York policeman who is MIB-in-training. Their boss? Rip Torn (who was outstanding in 'Dodgeball'). Their mission: to save a galaxy from an insect race of aliens.Most of the film is Hollywood excitement with very little substance. Some gun blasts, explosions and alien special effects. Not that it's bad or anything, but the actual story is fairly thin and the 'twist' is obvious. So this is therefore the perfect date movie, especially if you're a high school kid or trying to date one.Aside from Smith and Jones, the real credit goes to Vincent D'Onofrio in his strangest role ever. He has always played a good villain, but I doubt we'll ever see him like this again. Linda Florentino (???) was also excellent, and Tony Shalhoub was decent, though he needed a bigger part.I enjoyed the opening with the Mexicans (get it? Aliens!) sneaking into America. After that, it was all pretty much what you'd expect. Nothing memorable, nothing extremely clever. Just a fun movie, something that will be replayed on TNT for years to come. (Oh, and great product placement with the Marlboro cigarettes and New Your Post. I guess the aliens are from flavor country.) I wouldn't have watched this if I hadn't been told to, and I probably never will again. I'd rather watch 'Maniac Cop 3'.",6,1,2,31 August 2006
The Graduate," A Film That Stands The Test of Time
","Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is seduced by his parents' friend, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft). If that's not bad enough, Ben soon falls for her daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross), and life around Ben begins to collapse. Where is he to turn? Now, I could heap praise on this film. Sure, why not? AFI likes it, the IMDb likes it, everyone more or less knows it's a classic, parodied by Will Ferrell, 'Wayne's World' and Jon Secada, among others. So, I'm not going to talk about the stellar acting or directing (Mike Nichols does few films, but has some amazing ones)... because everyone does that.What I want to ask is this: who is the hero of this film? Roger Ebert reviewed this film twice -- once in 1967 and again in 1997. Originally, he sided with Ben Braddock, but upon reflection understood that the interesting character is Mrs. Robinson. I have to wonder, is anyone in this film worth rooting for? Ben is a shiftless, lazy homebody who takes a college career and squanders it. When confronted with the offer of a sexual liaison, despite knowing it's a bad idea, allows it to consume him. He goes on to fall in love with a girl who he has, as near as I can tell, only taken on one date, and chooses to marry her rather than pursue school, a job or other women. He then brings shame on the entire Robinson family.Mrs. Robinson, who has no first name and thus no identity apart from being a wife, is a cultured woman who fell into the trap of marriage. We can sympathize with her for this, but where she takes it seems foolish and spiteful. If she wanted an affair, other men would have made more rational choices. She tears apart her family, pits the Braddocks against the Robinsons, and rather than help set up her daughter with Ben, prematurely ruins their chances.Elaine Robinson is odd. College educated, she comes off as daft. She dates and nearly marries a man, then just as quickly flees him. Like her mother, she seems to throw away education and freedom for married life. She tends to be attracted to Ben, even after knowing about his affair, which would normally be a deal breaker. She appears the victim in all this, but is not really a deep enough character to really identity with.In short, this is a tragedy disguised as a comedy. There are darkly humorous moments and a light-hearted ending, but things seem to end poorly for everyone involved -- even Ben and Elaine are unlikely to find true love once they finally set about together. What a mess.",8,1,2,15 August 2009
Singin' in the Rain," A Singing, Dancing Masterpiece
","This film is set in a time where silent films are being converted to talkies. And the trouble lies in the fact that the successful duo, Lamont and Lakewood, have a woman (Jean Hagen) whose voice is more or less awful. How can they continue to be successful and open their mouths? I had some concerns with this film. Gene Kelly gets all the credit, but his little buddy is clearly the better dancer, especially during his long comedy scene. Sure, Kelly has more talking time, but the other guy gets the short end of the stick (so much so that I cannot even recall his name). Also, Lena's voice is made out to be bad, but it really wasn't that awful. Judy Holliday has roughly the same voice in 'Born Yesterday' and no one complains. I'm not sure why this is called 'Singin' in the Rain', as that's just one scene... it could just as easily have been called 'The Dueling Cavalier'. Oh well.The humor of converting silents to talkies is pretty great, more or less the highlight of the film. The strategic use of hidden microphones, and how the sound can get out of sync. The film as a whole is good and has some nice dance sequences if that's what you're into, but this part was really want made it memorable. This will go down as one of the greatest films in MGM history, and someday maybe it will get a retroactive 'Best Picture' Oscar.",7,0,2,5 March 2010
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Love, Forgetting... Fate, Chance
","Joel Barrish has a love-hate relationship with his girlfriend Clementine. But after things fall apart, the relationship goes from strained to bizarre: she has visited Lacuna, a service that deletes or erases people from your memory. Everything that was Joel in her mind is now gone. Joel, not wanting to be heartbroken alone, follows suit and undergoes the same treatment -- only to discover halfway through that even the worst memories come with good ones and both are important.Not surprisingly, this film is beautiful and sad. Why am I not surprised? Because it comes from Charlie Kaufman, who also brought us 'Adaptation' and 'Being John Malkovich'. Kaufman has the power to make the strange familiar and is something of a kingmaker in the world of acting -- 'Adaptation' may well be Nicolas Cage's best work, and this may well be Jim Carrey's. All those who doubted he could play serious roles had been proved otherwise. Kate Winslet also compliments him well and offers a nice departure for those used to her from 'Titanic'.If one wants, they can get into some great existential questions with this film: are bad memories important? Is it wrong to remove them? Are we destined to meet and love certain people or certain types of people? There's some wonder about the morality of removing another person from your memory and the biggest question of whether or not we need those memories to shape us. This film quotes Nietzsche and Alexander Pope -- but not one of Nietzsche's more well-known quotations: that which doesn't kill us only serves to make us stronger. Isn't that what pain is? A catalyst for growth? The supporting cast is excellent. Mark Ruffalo has a breakout performance (though not quite on par with 'Zodiac') and Kirsten Dunst is pretty lovable as Mary (though still not as lovable as Maggie Gyllenhaal). Elijah Wood also appears, which is good or bad depending on your love for Elijah Wood, I imagine.You will have to ignore certain continuity questions (if you see someone every day for two years, what becomes of those two years with them removed) but that really isn't the point of the film anyhow. It's about fate and chance (see also 'No Country For Old Men'). And it's amazing, easily deserving the accolades hoisted upon it. If you're inexperienced, make this a top priority in your life.",9,2,6,19 February 2008
Once Upon a Time in America," The Quintessential Gangster Film?
","Sergio Leone made a masterpiece and an epic with this one. Robert DeNiro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, the debut of Jennifer Connelly, Danny Aiello... the cast alone sells it.But then, you have a story of gangsters covering roughly 50 years, from their childhood to their old age. It is quite the story -- who becomes powerful, who goes to prison and who dies? I particularly loved the scene with the baby switching. The use of the music from 'Clockwork Orange' (I do not recall the actual song name) was priceless. I knew instantly that hijinks were coming and I was not let down.",8,1,4,13 May 2011
Taken," Turn Off Your Brain and Embrace This Awesome Film
","The daughter on an ex-CIA agent is touring Europe with U2. Well, that idea ends quickly when she is abducted in Paris by the Albanian mafia, who want to get her hooked on drugs and sell her as a prostitute to the highest bidder. But they picked the wrong daughter to mess with! Okay, let me just say first of all that I do not know how this film got such high esteem from the voters. Yes, it's awesome, but critically it's pretty cheesy. The acting is nothing special and the situations are impossible. Anyone who has any basic understanding of technology or intelligence gathering is going to slam their head into the wall.But, if you ignore that, and just sit back and let the film take you, you're going to be amused. Liam Neeson kicks butt and shoots his way through Paris, doing everything he can to rescue his daughter because, for gosh sakes, he loves the little spoiled brat. And anyone who has ever loved will understand exactly how he feels... even if they don't have the resources necessary to kick as much booty.I'm not one who watches a lot of Bond or Bourne or action flicks in general... but I loved this one. I hear rumor of a 'Taken 2' and I'm pretty excited about that. If it comes to a theater near me, I may be there on opening night.",7,0,0,2 February 2010
This Is Spinal Tap," Great Satire of the 1970s.1980s Metal Scene
","I'm not going to write a real review for this film because it's just so classic, having received numerous honors. Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean made their careers on this film. Rob Reiner might have gotten by with 'Spinal Tap' (he had, for example, 'The Princess Bride' a few years later)...And we also have very early appearances from Fred Willard, Fran Drescher, and Dana Carvey. Who would expect to see the three of them in one film? It took almost twenty years for Willard to really take off. Unfortunately, Bily Crystal also makes an appearance... the same mistake Reiner made in 'Princess Bride'. Sorry, Rob, that's just not right.",8,0,3,5 April 2009
Avatar," The Worst Film of James Cameron's Career
","When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully decides to take his place in a mission on the distant world of Pandora. There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of driving off the native humanoid Na'vi in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland.This film was pretty good when it was released the first time and called 'Ferngully'. This time, it is a thinly veiled political message with some awful animation. Iam aware of the work that went into it, but it still ends up looking like a cartoon, which is a failed endeavor.'I can watch films and say how technically beautiful they are, but I'm not impressed by any technicality,' said Abbas Kiarostami. And that is exactly right. If 'Avatar' is praised for its technology, and not for its direction, acting or intriguing plot, what good is it as a film?",4,4,9,22 June 2015
Toy Story 2," Excellent Pixar Entry
","When Woody (Tom Hanks) is stolen by a toy collector, Buzz (Tim Allen) and his friends vow to rescue him, but Woody finds the idea of immortality in a museum tempting.Clearly the 'Toy Story' series is the crown jewel of the Pixar Studios. As of 2015, they have had three films and they may be making more (which is a big gamble, but they are three for three thus far). Some people have argued that this film is better than the first film. They may be right. It is at least as good.The added 'villain' of the toy collector (Wayne Knight) was a great idea, and gives Woody a back story that was missing. Was it necessary? Maybe not. But it brings these characters to life, and shows us that life exists beyond Andy's bedroom. Such a grand adventure for such small heroes.",7,2,3,5 January 2015
Chariots of Fire," Inspiration?
","Two British track athletes, one a determined Jew and the other a devout Christian, compete in the 1924 Olympics.So, yeah, this is a movie that is probably better known for its soundtrack than its actual plot. That Vangelis theme? Can you even count all the times it was used and parodied? No, because no one can count that high. And yet, how many of us can name the runners in the 1924 Olympics, some of whom are featured prominently here? Almost none of us.How this film rocked the Academy Awards is a bit of a mystery, though the 1980s were a strange time, especially for movies. This is a really good film, but the best one of 1981? Doubtful. (Then again, even today the Academy does seem to pick the right choice... that is a rather rare event.)",6,5,8,4 August 2015
Frank," Fairly Entertaining
","Jon, a young wanna-be musician, discovers he has bitten off more than he can chew when he joins an eccentric pop band led by the mysterious and enigmatic Frank (Michael Fassbender).How to categorize this film? While it has comic elements, it is not outright funny. But it is no drama, and definitely not action or romance. It just has a subtle, quirky vibe, like a subdued Wes Anderson film, perhaps. With a bit of Irish mixed in.Whatever it is, it is enjoyable.And that head, oh my, that head. Thank you very much for putting Fassbender under he head and not Johnny Depp as originally planned. Depp is old news, Fassbender is the new hotness.",7,1,2,20 January 2015
Drag Me to Hell," Good? Yes. Epic? No.
","A bank employee is forced to make a tough decision -- denying an old woman an extension on her home loan. While this may have helped her career, it jeopardized her life. The old woman, a gypsy, puts a horrible curse on the woman, where an evil spirit (a lamia) will drag her soul to hell in four days.Many of us were waiting for Sam Raimi's return to horror (aside from his production work for Ghost House), and here it is. For me, personally, it was an experience that was both welcoming and disheartening. any of Raimi's old tricks are back, but some of his new tricks are present too, much to my chagrin.A good friend informed me that the first fifteen minutes of the film are 'epic', a word that is not to be used lightly. In this, I strongly disagree. While some of the later scenes were very intense and quite fun (the parking lot scene, for example), the first fifteen minutes were largely a waste of film. The introduction with the Mexican family serves only a minimal plot purpose, and we are treated to a bit too much bank employee exposition.What are the old tricks and new tricks I refer to? Let me lay it out for you. The old tricks include: the return of the Delta 88, some great camera shots (again in the parking lot scene), a demonic dance, a possessed goat, and a very subtle cameo by Ted Raimi that you'll miss if you don't recognize Ted's voice. Sadly, Bruce Campbell was not available for the film to make a cameo. The new tricks? Computer generated animation. I have expressed my disapproval of CG in countless reviews, but it's even more sad from Raimi, who is known for his camera techniques and stop-motion work. Sure, this isn't low budget, but animated fire doesn't scare me.Overall, while I didn't find the film to be groundbreaking, it is well worth a view. Raimi includes plenty of his splatter effects (blood, drool, and other bodily fluids) and generally gives us a good ghost story, particularly for working in the PG-13 framework (which is a mistake). The end is also satisfying. Compare this to Stuart Gordon's 'Stuck' and it seems that Raimi has the more lasting impact on horror.As of this writing, the film is in the cheap seats, so by the time you read this, it will likely be out on video. Be sure to rent this. The film likely didn't make as much in theaters as expected, especially with the overbearing media campaign (which was enough to turn me -- a Raimi fan -- off). Let's help them recoup their losses on the video sales. No doubt the special features will make this well worth it.",7,1,4,21 July 2009
Selma," Good Focus, Some Breakthrough Acting
","A chronicle of Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965.Whether or not the film is completely historically accurate is open to debate. Particularly the portrayal of Lyndon Johnson. But this is not necessarily the point of a film... if it gets people to look into civil rights history more, good for everyone involved! The portrayal of King is excellent. Not just the acting (which is superb), but its fairness. It is all too easy to show him as a martyr or a saint. This film did neither. By avoiding his assassination and actually bringing up his infidelity, he comes across as very human, and someone who accomplished great things despite his personal failings.This is also a breakout role for Tim Roth. Although best known for 'Reservoir Dogs', Roth is a top notch actor and he proves it here as the villain. The Oscar buzz is around the failure to nominate Ava DuVernay as director, but perhaps Roth should be looked at again for supporting actor.",7,1,2,15 February 2015
Grindhouse," Death Proof
","It's ladies night and the feeling's right... for Stuntman Mike. After encountering a group of girls at the local tavern, he decides to have his way with them. And not in the way you might think. The second half repeats the event with another group of girls, only this time things go decidedly different.I loved this film. I didn't see it in the theater, but I saw the extended cut on DVD. So I can't speak for the differences other than that I know the lap dance scene is longer and they added in the toe-licking scene, both of which are great. Many people, including my horror buddy Jason, told me this film was slow and Tarantino had lost his edge. And yeah, it was slow, but I think this worked -- it probably seemed worse in theater because it followed the non-stop bull ride of 'Planet Terror'.The dialog is not Tarantino's best, but it's not bad. There's no quotables like the 'royale with cheese' or pretty much the entire script of 'Reservoir Dogs'. But he makes the mundane, everyday conversation seem like something worth watching. And he knows how to write them. Compare this conversation (the one by the first group of girls) to conversations in other films, and you can't tell me that this wasn't more realistic. So, that's a pretty good job.For those who wanted gore, thinking this was a horror film, you probably were disappointed. Sure, there's some really good blood in the car crash scene (and even a face getting ripped off by a tire) but it happens in under 30 seconds, so you really have to keep your expectations low if you want gore. Me, I didn't mind. The suspense of the story was all I needed to keep me waiting to see what Mike was going to do next. He was a weird guy, both maniacal and calculated.Tarantino, or whoever did the casting, knew what hey were doing. The first group of girls was just alright, but since we wanted them to die it was okay we didn't find them as attractive. But in the second group, we have Rosario Dawson (whom I don't generally like, but was okay here) and the love of my life, Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Actually, the love of my life is Mandy Moore, but Winstead is the best horror has to offer. That cheerleader outfit was divine.Also, I loved the soundtrack. Tarantino is great at exposing viewers to 1970s music they've long since forgotten or never even heard of. The Coasters 'Down in Mexico', April March's 'Chick Habit' and the thumping 'Hold Tight' are just stellar. Sure ,he could throw in some modern pop or rock songs, get a soundtrack that sells millions. But why? He's mining gold right here. Just as he's done on 'Kill Bill' and all films before. He made 'Stuck in the Middle With You' a bigger hit than it ever was the first time out.Some have complained it's too self-referential, with the subtle in-jokes about the other movies, including Texas Ranger McGraw, the Vipers outfit, the 'tasty beverage' and more. Screw the critics. Self-referencing, or any referencing at all, makes a solid film. It's that subtlety that pays off for the alert and insightful that really drives a film home. Kevin Smith, who I think has a lot in common with Tarantino, is very self-referential. And you know what? It makes his films gold because you won't catch all the connections your first time.Let's list off the amazing cast: Kurt Russell (Stuntman Mike), Rosario Dawson, Jordan Ladd, Rose McGowan (who is much hotter as a brunette and a former love of mine, but I'll take her as a blonde), Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Zoe Bell (Uma Thurman's real-life stunt double, and Quentin Tarantino as Warren the Bartender. Priceless.If this film bored you in theater, give it another chance. I think the extended edition really adds some missing flavor. Sure ,you're not getting the sex and gore and non-stop thrills, but there's something about this film that really captures the style it was shooting for (the style of 'Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry') in a Tarantino vein. I think it kicks a llama's butt.",8,0,1,24 December 2014
The Artist," Safely Earned its Best Picture Award, Great on Many Levels
","A silent movie star (Jean Dujardin) meets a young dancer, but the arrival of talking pictures sends their careers in opposite directions.By itself, this picture is pretty great. It is a tale of love, of pride and the tragedy of a man's stubbornness to keep up with the times. Whether you are an actor or in any other profession, shunning the latest advancements will leave you in the dust.The lead character, George Valentin, is an interesting man. We cannot fully feel sorry for him -- his troubles are largely his own fault. Yet, he is so lovable that we have to side with him to some degree, even if we know his efforts are in vain. He is not cruel or spiteful, just proud. Too proud.And yet, beyond the great story is a beautiful film. They took the idea of a silent film and brought it in a new direction. I love silent films, but have to admit many of them can be tedious for today's audience. This movie knows its audience and never allows the silence to be a hindrance -- thus being ironic, promoting the story of silent movies' demise in a successful silent movie! It is the better half of 'Singing in the Rain' in this regard.And the film is not only a love letter to the silent film era but to silent film directors in particular. Using only the styles they had in their day (this film has no zoom shots, for example) we see Murnau's direction accentuated -- particularly his classic 'Sunrise'. Will this movie cause kids to go out and rent films from the 1920s? Probably not, but it should -- Murnau's genius stands tall even today, as this modern homage proves.2011 was an interesting year for film. Many great films had a connection to France and Paris, with three in particular -- this film features a French cast, both 'Hugo' and 'Midnight in Paris' take place in Paris. All three films also bring us back to the early days, with 'Midnight in Paris' showcasing great writers and artists and 'Hugo' actually involving Georges Meliere -- the inventor of cinema -- as a character! But 'The Artist' really nails it. It transcends the history of film, the 'now' of time and the barrier of language. It truly is the best film of 2011.",8,0,2,20 July 2012
There's Something About Mary," I Dislike Raunchiness and Diaz, But Still Like This Film
","'There's Something About Mary' is definitely one of the funniest films of the last twenty years. I am not a fan of Cameron Diaz, and I do not care for the trend of raunchiness in films (such as the 'American Pie' movies) but this one has enough wit and charm that I can look past that.Also, the cast is pretty incredible to have all in one movie: besides Cameron Diaz, you have Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller, Chris Elliott, Lin Shaye, Jeffrey Tambor, Keith David, Sarah Silverman, Jonathan Richman, Richard Jenkins, and Harland Williams. Holy cow! There is no substitute for watching a film unedited, but if it is playing on FX, you may want to catch it there. The editing is hilarious: they keep the drug scene and the semen, but edit the heck out of the cursing, including dubbing in the phrase 'frogging ashbowl'.",7,0,3,22 January 2011
Mission: Impossible," More Than Adequate Action Film
","An American agent (Tom Cruise), under false suspicion of disloyalty, must discover and expose the real spy without the help of his organization.Although the original cast disliked this new incarnation, I think they missed the point in a way -- this was not to be a strict continuation but more of a new beginning. Those lines might have been blurred if the old cast reprised their roles, but they did not, and I do not see this one in any way detracting from the television show.Stephen Holden of the New York Times wrote, 'If that story doesn't make a shred of sense on any number of levels, so what? Neither did the television series, in which basic credibility didn't matter so long as its sci-fi popular mechanics kept up the suspense.' I feel like this really nails it. The key is the suspense and not the plot. While more something you expect from Joel Schumacher than Brian De Palma, I think De Palma' got it'.",7,0,0,25 November 2013
Saw," The First Great Franchise of the Twenty-First Century
","Two seemingly unrelated people (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whinnell) wake up in a secluded, dingy bathroom, chained to the wall. With nothing but their wits, a few clues, and a hacksaw, they must figure out who put them in their predicament and how to get out. Well, assuming they're able to get out. For an added bonus, one of the men has a kidnapped family on the outside.Falsely categorized as 'torture porn' (the violence and gore here are more in line with 'Seven' than 'Hostel'), this film was the first smart horror film of the 2000s. Intelligent horror fans not only got the blood they wanted, but a clever villain and a mystery to solve. Later sequels would get more complicated than episodes of 'Lost', and the series loses something as it goes (all franchises do), but this original stands as one of the modern greats. And, luckily, you can watch it without any of the sequels and it makes sense.There has been an effort in recent years to academically analyze 'Saw', injecting a false connotation on to the film. One scholarly article points to the 'militarization' of Jigsaw in a post-9/11 world. Jigsaw, like the military, carries out violent acts, but has found ways to rationalize them with moral justifications (saving the worthy, letting the undeserving die). The author makes various other parallels about a 'military' setting, mentioning IEDs and the industrial setting of Jigsaw's workshop. I find this to be largely silly, and not at all the creators' intention. I see a much more obvious line of progression from 'Silence of the Lambs' to 'Seven' to 'Saw' with the advent of the brilliant, self-moralizing serial killer. Even Hitchcock's 'Rope' offered a justification for murder, albeit a poor one. Terrorism or not, the horror film will go on.You can make complaints, sure. But for young writers and directors, this was a blockbuster and deserved the massive success it got. As someone who pays close attention to a film's writing and plot, I was stunned. My only real concern is at the very end, when the key's location is revealed. I can't discuss this in a review, but let's just say I found that to be uncharacteristic and unfair of the killer.If you haven't seen 'Saw' yet, see it. And see the second film. After that, they start to go downhill. But the first two are quite good and must-see viewing for all horror fans.",9,0,1,21 February 2010
Mama," Not Flawless, But Better Than Average Horror
","Annabel (Jessica Chastain) and Lucas are faced with the challenge of raising his young nieces that were left alone in the forest for 5 years.... but how alone were they? I am very conflicted on this film. While overall I have to say I liked it, and thought it was one of the better horror films I have seen recently, it is not without its flaws. For one thing, I found Jessica Chastain as a punk rocker a bit hard to swallow (though she pulled it off better than Kristen Stewart trying to be Joan Jett). I also think that they showed the CG a bit too much. Not that it was terrible by CG standards, but one of the keys to a good monster is not showing it...Those criticisms aside, this was a generally good film. The atmosphere was eerie, there were some good jump scares, the little girls (especially the younger of the two) were phenomenal actresses... and I am pleased they made this PG-13 rather than R because the focus was on the mood and not the language or sexuality (which would be quite inappropriate considering this is still basically a story about kids).I loved the look of the flashback scene. The style was excellent. Again, I have to bring up the CG -- I would rather they never used any at all, but the people who did it made it look decent. Not perfect, but pretty good. Better than in other contemporary horror or fantasy releases.The story of the doctor and his searches... that part left me unsure of how I felt. I got the impression that the heart and soul of the story is built around the two girls and the creepiness of the Mama ghost. The doctor seemed like he was added just to push it from a short film to 100 minutes. Not that this is a bad thing, but was it crucial? Was it maybe better as a short film? Hard to say.",7,1,3,24 April 2013
Super 8," Abrams Does Spielberg
","During the summer of 1979, a group of friends witness a train crash and investigate subsequent unexplained events in their small town.I do love the inclusion of the Walkman, the Soviets and other period things, especially the music. While I did not live in 1979, I appreciate period pieces of the 70s and 80s (Ti West's Satanic Panic film nailed this.) I also like that at times, the film has the sensibility of 'Goonies'. I wish the whole film did, because these were the stronger scenes. The monster part was less interesting, actually ,than the childhood adventures.Roger Ebert summed it nicely when he wrote, 'Super 8 is a wonderful film, nostalgia not for a time but for a style of film-making, when shell-shocked young audiences were told a story and not pounded over the head with aggressive action. Abrams treats early adolescence with tenderness and affection.'",7,0,3,24 August 2013
The Last Samurai," Excellent Period Piece
","An American military adviser (Tom Cruise) embraces the Samurai culture he was hired to destroy after he is captured in battle.Say what you will about Tom Cruise. We all know that despite his popularity (or former popularity) he was never a good actor. A very successful, very highly-paid actor, but critically rather bland. This, however, is one of his more interesting roles (even if he is nothing special in it).Is this remotely historically accurate? Probably not. Granted, it has some nice touches (such as correctly calling Custer a colonel and not a general). And it showcases the samurai culture very nicely. This may be the only American film that has ever made such an attempt. (Fittingly, of course, because what American director would want to compete with Kurosawa?)",7,0,0,9 February 2015
3 Idiots," I Don't Get It
","Two friends are searching for their long lost companion. They revisit their college days and recall the memories of their friend who inspired them to think differently, even as the rest of the world called them 'idiots'.I am absolutely convinced that these Indian films get high ratings because Indians are voting them high out of national pride. They are not that funny, they tend to run much too long, and they are loaded with bright colors and silly songs. That may make them fun, but it does not make them good. (And even the fun wears out after the two hour mark.) But can one billion Indian voters be wrong? As much as I think yes, if majority rules then my opinion will have to be minority.",6,9,24,22 June 2015
Life Is Beautiful," Oddly Irreverent
","A Jewish man (Roberto Benigni) has a wonderful romance with the help of his humor, but must use that same quality to protect his son (Giorgio Cantarini) in a Nazi death camp.Roger Ebert wrote, 'At Cannes, it offended some left-wing critics with its use of humor in connection with the Holocaust. What may be most offensive to both wings is its sidestepping of politics in favor of simple human ingenuity. The film finds the right notes to negotiate its delicate subject matter.' Indeed, this is he most striking thing about this film (from its opening mocking the arm-outstretched salute), just how much it refuses to take anything seriously.In that respect, it is a response to 'Schindler's List', even if not intended to be. Sometimes in the face of evil, you just have to laugh, and Benigni takes that approach.",7,0,1,12 November 2014

Right after lifting off, however, he learns he isn't alone on his journey, since Russell, a wilderness explorer 70 years his junior, has inadvertently become a stowaway on the trip.The way this film is shown in previews, I thought it would be mostly about a floating house. That is not true, and thankfully so. The best aspects are watching Carl grow old and the talking dogs (Dug and Alpha are pretty great). This film has a very human quality to it, and is not strictly a kids film.I did not like Russell much, but I suppose he was necessary.

A Clockwork Orange," Could be Kubrick's Best Film (Easily His Most Famous)
","Young Alex DeLarge (Malcolm MacDowell) rapes, murders and listens to Beethoven. When his gang turns against him, he is caught by the police and sent to prison. From there, he undergoes a treatment to cure his violent urges. Will it work?Casting: I think the cast was perfect, and this is Malcolm MacDowell's most recognizable role. Watching 'Clockwork Orange' tends to lead to the debate of what's Kubrick's best film, as he has made so many classics. Many would say '2001', but this film puts up a good fight. But you really never hear people debate their favorite Malcolm film role, because it's invariably going to be this one, I think.Imagery: Kubrick uses vibrant colors and some odd images. The milk bar is especially unusual, and sexual imagery appears all over in even the most ordinary of places. The cat house? A sign that says 'home'? Very unusual stuff. The strong Christ imagery? Intense. From my recollection of the book, it was never this extreme and we have Kubrick to thank for such a radical interpretation of futuristic England.Music: Obviously, Beethoven's 9th plays a key role in this and it's worked in well. But also, the synthesized music fits (such as in the record store). I don't know if it makes you think of the future, but it certainly makes you think this is a very foreign place from the world we know today (yet, the lessons and morals here are just as important).Some discussions could be attached to this film -- is it right to limit a man's choices, even if the choices eliminated are bad? In real life, is it okay to chemically castrate rapists rather than have them make their own choices? Is human nature defined by free choice, or are we predisposed? There is lots of room for discussion of these and other topics.If you haven't seen this, see it. I don't recall anyone ever leaving this film unchanged. It tends to be more easily accepted by men than women, for some reason, and I've been hesitant to recommend it to women. Some have said they 'don't get it' and others can't get past the rape scene (which is disturbing, but serves to drive the point home). But then again, I had a female professor who had us read the book (I had already read it at that point). So, who knows. Really, this film is the very definition of morality, freedom and the nihilistic future we're heading towards.",10,2,6,26 July 2007
Stalingrad," Germans at War
","A depiction of the brutal battle of Stalingrad, the Third Reich's 'high water mark', as seen through the eyes of German officer Hans von Witzland (Thomas Kretschmann) and his battalion.There is something historically and culturally significant about this film. One, as an American, history is very much taught in this country from an American point of view. That may not be a bad thing, but it leaves us with the impression that America won World War II. That is true in the general sense, but it was the Soviet Union that defeated Hitler. The Americans were much more involved with Japan. So to have films that focus on Russia during World War II is always good.But two, it is interesting to see films like this come out of Germany. You walk a fine line. Obviously, you want to be proud of your country and part of that is being proud of military victories. But, at the same time, you don't want to praise the Nazi regime or suggest that what they did was right. How you promote the bravery of soldiers without endorsing their fight is tough, but this film seems to make a serious effort at doing so.",7,1,2,18 April 2016
The Fly," A Little Slice of Heaven for Dessert
","Scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) has figured out how to transport objects from one place to another... by teleportation. But when he tries to transport himself, a horrible accident occurs: a fly gets stuck in the pod with him. What will the outcome be and can Seth reverse it before it is too late? Let me say I love David Cronenberg and I love Jeff Goldblum. I also love the original 'Fly' with Vincent Price (although the similarities are only with the most basic plot). And let me also say, I had the greatest day of my life before I came home and put this movie on for viewing. So, all in all, I was feeling in a pretty fine mood. (And sober.) Cronenberg delivers with his three notable themes: insects (duh), 'the flesh' (Goldblum delivers a nice rant about the flesh) and horrifying special effects. Like 'The Brood' or 'Rabid' or even 'A History of Violence', we see some interesting deformities. A baboon who meets an awful fate stands out in my mind. We also have the music of Howard Shore, always attached to Cronenberg's hip.The special effects are noteworthy (also for the interesting 'fly walking' and the 'vomit drop'), but let's not discount the acting. Almost through the entire film, we are treated to Geena Davis and Jeff Goldblum and basically no one else. I am still not sure why Davis married Goldblum, but their chemistry in this is excellent. They work well as a romantic couple. Davis is the steady anchor to Goldblum's flux of a character (heck, he's literally going through a Kafkaesque metamorphosis).If you like a ranting Goldblum, this is your film. He won't watch you poop, but he will ramble in ways Ian Malcolm ('Jurassic Park') never could. In one scene in a diner, you really have to pay attention because he's like the Micro Machines guy, but explaining exoskeletal biology and not so much miniaturized automobiles. This was my favorite scene.If you're a fan of Goldblum or Cronenberg, you're going to love this. But if you're not, this might be the film that converts you. Whereas 'A History of Violence' is very mainstream and 'Videodrome' is just weird, this has a happy balance: weird, but not so strange that you have to be a film student or a wackjob to really appreciate it. (I'm not a film student and I liked 'Videodrome', so think of me what you will.) Yes, 'The Fly', the film that will either win you over to Cronenberg or further deepen your love. That's my promise.",9,2,4,13 February 2007

","National Treasure is the story of a cynical treasure-hunter named Jon Voight who has given up on the dream of finding his family's lost treasure. That is, until one day when his son Nicolas Cage shows up with a beautiful German girl and a trendy computer hacker and they have stolen the Declaration of Independence. Then the feathers hit the fan, as Voight searches for the treasure again and refuses to fail no matter how many nasty British thugs want him dead. This film soars high with action, suspense, a healthy dose of history (though sometimes inaccurate) and Harvey Keital. While it does have some logical inconsistencies, the film is overly enjoyable and could even be the third greatest presentation from Cage to date (behind '8MM' and 'Con Air').

Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's Masterpiece
","A group of criminals are assembled to pull off a diamond heist, but something goes wrong and all heck breaks loose. To top it off, the ones who escape must face the facts: someone in the team was a rat. But who was it? And what do they do with the cop in the trunk?I think many people consider 'Pulp Fiction' Tarantino's best film, and I would agree that it's a fine film. But 'Reservoir Dogs' uses the same formula even earlier, with a tighter script and solid actors (without relying on heavyweights like Bruce Willis). And, I think it's safe to say, this one has created more of a cult following and generates more homages (the walking in unison scene, the cop torture scene, etc.).We definitely get Michael Madsen's best performance here, and a strong Steve Buscemi. Was Madsen good in 'Free Willy'? Sure, but this is his defining role that kept him popular for the next decade. Buscemi always shines, but again he stands out here like he's not allowed to do anywhere else (with the possible exception of 'Ghost World'). Chris Penn (science bless him) and Tim Roth also are wonderful.Tarantino knows how to incorporate music into his movies -- you have to give him that. Taking lost or forgotten songs and making them sound fresh and new. Stealers Wheel was already known for 'Stuck in the Middle With You' long before Tarantino put it in his movie, but how many of us can now never hear it the same way again? Radio play of the song likely increased, and we're all picturing the same thing...We also see his strong dialog writing skills. This is Tarantino's best skill: dialog. Sometimes this hinders him (some think it dragged down the pace of 'Kill Bill Volume 2', almost all agree that 'Death Proof' was too dialog-heavy). But other times it's the driving force. 'Reservoir Dogs' is largely memorable for it's conversations, such as the Madonna conversation and the tipping conversation. Madsen and Buscemi are very quotable ('Are you gonna bark all day little doggie, or are you gonna bite?'). 'Pulp Fiction' steps this up a notch (the watch story, Royale with Cheese, Big Kahuna burger), but the foundation really rests on this movie.If you haven't seen this one, see it. As of this review, it is sitting at the 65th best movie of all time according to Internet Movie Database. I have no reason to deny it that ranking. It might be better, it might be worse -- but it's clearly a strong movie.",9,2,5,2 August 2007
How to Train Your Dragon," A Real Oscar Contender
","A hapless young Viking (Jay Baruchel) who aspires to hunt dragons becomes the unlikely friend of a young dragon himself, and learns there may be more to the creatures than he assumed.'How to Train Your Dragon' had an unfortunate bit of timing on its release. In probably any other year, it would have been a front-runner for an Oscar, but it had to face off against 'Toy Story 3', one of the more powerfully emotional animated films in recent memory. With its breathtaking animation, HTTYD easily outdoes 'Toy Story' in its innovations, but you just cannot argue with emotion.The film also has a great metaphor on war, and those who are different. Some might dismiss this as liberal nonsense, and perhaps it is to some extent. But there is clearly a parallel to the real world: many wars that are fought may be against an enemy who never wanted to be an enemy in the first place. Of course, this is not universal; there was no alternative to war with Hitler (see the second film)... but maybe we should start seeing our enemies from their own point of view.",8,1,2,17 November 2014
"SalÃ², or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Praised and Reviled
","Four fascist libertines round up nine adolescent boys and girls and subject them to a hundred and twenty days of physical, mental and sexual torture.Now, who would have thought that taking a Marquis de Sade book about the most vile sexual acts imaginably... and turning it into a film almost as equally vile... was a good idea? That was a brave move, and obviously one that would come with more than its share of controversy.But this controversy is also why it must be praised. Though it is indeed vile ,and often hard to watch, everyone involved came their complete efforts to make this the strong, memorable monstrosity that it is. It remains a parable of fascism, a story of horror as well as war.",7,1,1,26 January 2016
Total Recall," The Trilogy Needs Total Recall
","When a man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) goes for virtual vacation memories of the planet Mars, an unexpected and harrowing series of events forces him to go to the planet for real, or does he?One could consider 'Total Recall' part of a Philip K. Dick trilogy: Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report. With A Scanner Darkly and Paycheck (among others) creating an extended trilogy (you know, like Douglas Adams did). Total Recall is easily worthy of standing beside Blade Runner. And even as a stand-alone sci-fi film, it ranks as one of the better ones of the 1990s, if not all time.One of the great things about Total Recall is the ambiguous nature of the story. Is it a dream? A brain embolism? Reality? Any of these has evidence to support it and also to contradict it. And this is a strength for the movie.There is a certain absurdity with the special effects -- eyes bulging and whatnot when the people lose oxygen. In real life you would simply die in space, not explode. But at the same time this was somewhat amusing and a bit comical so it can be overlooked. Besides, coming from Rob Bottin ('The Thing'), the focus should be on the strengths of the makeup and effects and not the possible shortfalls.The casting was great. Arnold was a great choice, and no one else could be Quaid. Kurt Russell, Stallone, Swayze... these guys are great but not right for this part. And Sharon Stone was looking her best for this movie, and since her role seemed to be the sexpot wife who does little more than exercise and seduce her husband, that is a big endorsement.Clearly the best character was Benny the Cab Driver, played by Mel Johnson, Jr in his only notable role. He stole the scenes he was in with great comic timing and an interesting back-story. I was quite interested by how he went from being what could have been a minor background role to a primary figure in the overall plot. Exquisite.I guess I simply must recommend you see this movie. If you have not seen Blade Runner, watch that first. If you have not seen Minority Report, watch this first. But either way, be sure that you put this movie somewhere high on your to-do list.",8,25,29,31 May 2006
Limitless," An Intelligent Thriller
","A writer (Bradley Cooper) discovers a top-secret drug which bestows him with super human abilities.While I have questioned Bradley Cooper's acting ability, this film is a showcase for his range. He is not the cream of the crop (at least not yet), but he is still better than average given what I saw here. His ability to smoothly transition between schlepp and genius was flawless, and with a little help from a hairstylist he was able to look both parts.The very concept of this film is one that has intrigued me for a long time, at least since I encountered 'Star Trek''s Data as a teenager. What if we could expand our memories and recall? If not to the level in this film ,at least to some degree? We could solve many of the world's problems. Stock markets? Bah! We could end world hunger. Maybe some day... maybe.Also, DeNiro is excellent here. Much better than he is in 'Silver Linings Playbook'. He was nominated for the wrong film.",7,1,3,19 February 2013
Rocky," An Inspirational Film About People Who Don't Talk Right
","Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is an amateur boxer. He's a good fighter, maybe even a great fighter, but he's never gone professional and is starting to get old. Then one way on a whim, the champion of the world (Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers) calls him out to a fight. With some training and the help of a montage and a plain-jane girlfriend (Adrian, played by Talia Shire), maybe Rocky just might win. This is his story.Rocky's an undeniable classic. Heck, he's got six movies out now and maybe someday a seventh (though I would really doubt that). Anything I say wouldn't matter because it's been said by everyone else over the past thirty-one years. So, instead, I'll just say what I feel like.I really enjoyed Talia Shire's performance. Being the shy, simple girlfriend was a nice departure for her from 'The Godfather'. Sure, maybe it seems like a useless role, but she's quite crucial to the plot when you see how she supports Rocky and also causes a wedge between Rocky and his best friend Paulie (Adrian's brother). So she was cool, and I liked how she became more attractive as the film went on and her esteem went up.Apollo Creed is a great villain. He's not necessarily a bad guy -- he may, in fact, be very nice. But he is an obstacle to glory and must be overcome, whether he deserves to be or not. Someone someday would do it -- why not Rocky? It was also nice to see Michael Dorn (best known as Star Trek's Worf) as one of his bodyguards.What else? The meat-packing scenes were cool, and an interesting training method. The iconic stairs scene was okay, but not as powerful as homages let on. Lloyd Kaufman shows up as a drunk, which is awkward but fun. And we have the classic song 'Gonna Fly Now' that tells us 'hey, Rocky's really getting pumped. Like super-pumped. You better not make him angry'.If you haven't seen 'Rocky', see it. I went over 26 years without seeing a 'Rocky' film just because I never had a good reason to see one. And although I can't offer a good reason for you to see one either, the bottom line is this is a good film. As for the sequel, I don't know yet... you'll have to wait for future reviews...",8,1,2,3 October 2007
Don't Breathe," A New Twist on Home Invasion
","Hoping to walk away with a massive fortune, a trio of thieves break into the house of a blind man (Stephen Lang) who isn't as helpless as he seems.Those who are going in to see 'Don't Breathe' should do so with as little knowledge as possible. You can know it is a horror film in the 'home invasion' subgenre. You can know there is a twist (the back of the box reveals as much). But you should not know what that twist is, and only know that even in a world full of movie twists, this one may be unexpected.Not knowing anything, I thought maybe this would be like a modern retelling of 'Wait Until Dark'. It is nothing like that at all. And because I knew it was a home invasion story with a twist, I immediately thought of 'Shut In', the recent film starring Rory Culkin. It isn't really like that, either, beyond some superficial similarities.The film's biggest weakness comes in the first fifteen minutes. We are given a somewhat sympathetic view of our burglars, and one that seems off. All three leads have a presence in the modern history of horror, being in such films as 'Goosebumps' and 'It Follows'. But here, they are most effective as burglars rather than as tragic figures. At no point was I on the side of Rocky because of her troubled childhood. Maybe other viewers will approach the film differently, but I don't see personal problems as an excuse to victimize other people.After those initial fifteen minutes, the attempt at character development stops and the film really goes into high gear. We get plenty of tense scenes, over-the-top violence, and moments that call to mind the 'Saw' series or 'The Collector' (though this film never goes as far as the so-called torture porn aspects of either of those other two). Whether you are rooting for our protagonists or not (I wasn't), you can't help but be strapped in for the remainder of the ride.I must address the praise from the box. Forbes says the movie has 'the best twist in years', which I may or may not agree with, but cannot deny that there are parts that surprise even the most hardened viewer. I do, however, take issue with the quote from Jim Hemphill, calling this the 'best American horror film in twenty years'. Ignoring what defines 'American' (the writer-director is from Uruguay and the film was made in Hungary), is this really the best horror film since 1996? Hemphill was not quoted out of context; this is really what he thinks.I can comfortably call 'Don't Breathe' one of the best horror films of the last decade. I could even say it is possibly the best horror film of 2016, but a few others (such as 'The Unseen' or 'The Witch') could edge it out. But the best of all the horror films since 1996? Off the top of my head, 'It Follows' is a better film. 'House of the Devil' is better, as well. Some would probably argue that 'Blair Witch' was better, or at the very least more influential. Again, I'm not trying to say 'Don't Breathe' isn't a strong horror film (it is), but Hemphill is probably in the minority.The Blu-ray, out now from Sony, brings the film to your home looking and sounding great. There are also eight deleted scenes, five behind-the-scenes featurettes on the cast, crew, set and sound. And if you're into the stories behind the movie itself, there is a feature-length commentary with the director (Fede Alvarez), writer (Rodo Sayagues) and star Stephen Lang.",7,2,7,28 November 2016
The Red Violin," A Centuries-Long Tale
","A perfect red-colored violin inspires passion, making its way through three centuries over several owners and countries, eventually ending up at an auction where it may find a new owner.I know precious little about violins or about Stradivarius and why his violins are considered the best in the world. But this story is told in such a way where you need to know nothing in order to appreciate that history. Everything is laid out here and in a much grander story arc than any real violin likely ever went through.Perhaps best of all was the casting of Samuel L. Jackson. He is the only real 'star' in the cast, and his character is among the most complex. Though we go through several centuries and multiple countries, Jsckson's story really ties it all together -- like the moment in '2001' where the bone becomes the satellite, Jackson is the modern day counterpart to the violin's entire history.",8,0,0,30 March 2015
Shine," Magic Fingers
","Pianist David Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush), driven by his father and teachers, has a breakdown. Years later he returns to the piano, to popular if not critical acclaim.I have to say this film did not personally strike me. That is not to say it is a bad film. It is very good film. But just not one that really captured my attention or made me really care about the characters. There is something to be said about talent, genius, mental instability and many other things, and this film says a little bit about each of those. But it did not hit quite hard enough.On the plus side, we have Geoffrey Rush. Today (2015), he is probably better known for his part in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies, but some of us remember when he had some great dramatic roles. This is one, as is his great work in 'Quills'.",6,2,2,20 May 2015
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick In His Final Days
","A New York City doctor (Tom Cruise), who is married to an art curator (Nicole Kidman), pushes himself on a harrowing and dangerous night-long odyssey of sexual and moral discovery after his wife admits that she once almost cheated on him.At this point (2015), I have seen all of Kubrick's work and love most of it. But 'Eyes Wide Shut' was one of my earlier Kubrick excursions, following the cult classics. At the time, responses seemed to be mixed. While I instantly loved it, others found it to be hard to handle.If anything, my opinion over the last fifteen years has only solidified this as being among Kubrick's best. We start out with some intrigue, then get into a light philosophical conversation about infidelity... before going head-on into a conspiracy theory that somehow still makes sense. This is a grand adventure, much larger in scale than anything else he had done. And he pulls it off brilliantly.",8,0,0,30 March 2015
Beauty and the Beast," Not Quite as Good as the Original
","An adaptation of the fairy tale about a monstrous-looking prince and a young woman who fall in love.If you have one of the all-time greatest cartoons, there are things you can do with it. Turn it into a musical is one. But turn it into a live-action version with practically nothing changed (though a few scenes added) may not be your best idea. Especially if such a version relies on CGI and you have neither the time nor the ability to pull it off.But if you are going to do it anyway, I suppose you could do much worse. Emma Watson was the ideal casting choice and no one else would have worked. No one. Josh Gad is spot on as LeFou. The Beast could be better, perhaps. My biggest casting complaint is Maurice. I suppose in this version he is less eccentric, but why is this the case? And why so tall? Kevin Kline is fantastic, but is he really Maurice?",7,24,38,15 October 2017
Sicario," A Different Look at the War on Drugs
","An idealistic FBI agent (Emily Blunt) is enlisted by a government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico.Let me start with this: Officials of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez criticized the depiction of that city, El Paso's cross-border twin, expressing their view that Sicario portrayed their city in a bad light, for instance in its sequences depicting nighttime firefights in the city, and tortured bodies of dead hanging from downtown viaducts.While the movie is not a true story, it is intended to send a message about a real situation: the violence associated with drugs. And because it intends to get a response, some level of realism ought to be encouraged. I have no idea if the CIA is doing border raids. I have real doubts that American soldiers can go within a mile of the border and kill citizens indiscriminately. If we are supposed to sympathize with Blunt's character, we ought to a) feel the violence by Americans is not justified and b) believe this is something that actually happens.But, even if it is an exaggeration, it still has a kernel of truth. El Paso is a nice city, but just over the border are slums. And we have to ask why that is. And while the film never touches on immigration directly, there is that topic always lurking in the background: can we blame Mexican citizens for illegally entering America if they are fleeing such violence and crippling levels of poverty? Legal or not, they could be said to have a moral right to defend their children by any means possible. (I am not advocating here or attempting to be political, but merely saying there are multiple issues and angles to consider.) The real breakout actor here was Benicio del Toro. This might have been Blunt's film, but del Toro really carries it in the second half. Rumors are that there will be a sequel that follows his character. Not sure how that is possible, but it could be interesting. He came off as a cross between Dirty Harry and Jason Bourne, one man against all the drug cartels. Could be an interesting story to follow if done right.The film received three Academy Award nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Sound Editing. As far as Best Sound Editing goes, I have no way to judge that properly, and cannot give an intelligent assessment one way or the other.Interestingly, on both Score and Cinematography, its biggest competitor is Quentin Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight'. And if it were up to me, I would split the difference and give them each an award. While the score for 'Sicario' is very distinct and stood out in my head as few others do, it is up against Ennio Morricone. Ho do you compete with a living legend, especially when this is likely his last chance at an Oscar? So I suspect that even if 'Sicario' has the better score (which is debatable), 'Eight' takes the statue.And we go the other way on Cinematography. What 'Eight' has going for it is the unusual decision to release a film in 70mm. But because so few theaters can even show it, and so few scenes of the movie really need it, it comes off as a gimmick. In contrast, 'Sicario' has great aerial shots, night vision shots, thermal shots... a whole range of ways to see the world not often used in one picture. And the man behind the camera is Roger Deakins, possibly the greatest cinematographer alive. So, give him the award.",7,0,1,21 February 2016
Departures," Beautiful and Funny
","A newly unemployed cellist (Masahiro Motoki) takes a job preparing the dead for funerals.While subject matter is grim, the film never presents it as such. Instead, there is plenty of humor (without being disrespectful), and a beautiful display of the ceremony and ritual that goes into death in Japan. While all cultures have their own customs, Japan's may be one of the most beautiful... and strikingly different than the United States, given that almost all the dead in Japan are cremated, whereas very few in the United States are.Making the main character a cellist is a nice touch in that it adds such great music to the moments throughout the film without making such music seem forced or out of place. Do musicians see the world differently? Maybe so.",8,0,0,20 December 2014
The Descent," Not Marshall's Best, But Still Better Than Many Horror Films
","A year after one woman loses her husband and daughter in a freak car accident, she joins up with five of her friends to go spelunking in a big cave. But a fun afternoon turns tragic, and the women are not alone... can they survive the dark, tight spaces, and the unknown? This movie is by no means original. Other movies take place in caves and other horror movies take place in caves and other movies, horror and others, have people encountering similar problems in caves. For example, 'The Cave' (see the review for this elsewhere). But this is not to say it's a bad film... all movies have predecessors, and this might set the new standard for cave movies.Also, I should highlight Neil Marshall, a 'rising star' on the horror scene and a member of the nonsensically sorted group known as the 'Splat Pack'. This is his second horror film, following 'Dog Soldiers'. Many in the horror world and in the media have praised 'The Descent'... but the real praise should be for 'Dog Soldiers', which is by far the better movie in terms of plot, editing and gore.'The Descent''s biggest flaw was, for me, the editing and pacing. I watched the DVD timer and the entire first hour consisted of simple talking about random things with no plot relevance (I'm glad they have a good girl's weekend, but why does this matter?). The action arrives in the last twenty minutes. The action is gory and fast-paced, but hardly makes up for the first hour. Could we have extended the second half and lost the first half? Or maybe just condensed this to an hour long film? I realize theaters won't carry shorter movies, but the fact of the matter is there was not enough of a story to tell here.I also think the number of characters could be reduced. I cannot tell you the names of the women for the most part, and they had little back story. Cutting the number down to four or five and making them more three dimensional would have helped tons. I think there was a lesbian relationship in there somewhere, but it was not made clear. And the thick Scottish and Irish accents made the women more dense... far too dense to throw that many people in without developing them.One small complaint: the women in this film were supposed to be about twenty-five from what I could gather. I found them to be in their mid-thirties. This made the film not only misleading (why do you look so old?) but denied the viewer a horror staple: young women. The iconic blood bath scene was hot, but would have been even hotter with a younger woman. (I suppose you could argue the woman with the child needed to look older, but I don't think so. A 25-year old woman could easily have a 6-year old daughter, especially after seeing 'Amityville Horror' where a young Melissa George somehow has a 12-year old daughter.) If you have the option, watch this film on DVD, because I honestly think the best part was the outtakes. Showing the green screen was hilarious... a nice surprise after such a snoozer of a film. I'm also disappointed in the special effects... notably the fake bats. Marshall proved in 'Dog Soldiers' he's a fake gore and puppetry master -- why all the computerized blood and bats and morlocks? Despite all my nitpickery and bashing, the movie is still worth seeing and really sets a pace for other films of its kind. Neil Marshall has made a name for himself with this one and I hope he is able to ride that wave with 'Doomsday' and future projects. I know what he's capable of and I want nothing more than for him to give fans the very best.",7,0,1,4 January 2007
Some Like It Hot," An Archetype... That's Pretty Great
","'Some Like It Hot' is hard to explain. The film, if you've never seen it, is going to feel like something you've seen a hundred times before. And you probably have, but they did it first. To be successful, two guys dress up as women, and then one falls for a woman (Marilyn Monroe) -- so how does he tell her without her hating him for keeping the secret? We have seen plenty of films where guys get close to women because of some trick -- usually innocently -- and then have to inevitably reveal the truth. And sometimes this involves cross-dressing. I think it's safe to say that 'Some Like it Hot' was the first film to play this plot, especially with the cross-dressing.This film is funny, to be sure, and has a very nice innocence to it in that it seems pretty obvious to the audience that the women are men. The broad shoulders, the weird bumps while wearing a swimsuit? How the girls don't catch on is beyond me. And then to not recognize the guys while in male clothing... wow.",8,2,2,18 March 2010
Hoosiers," Decent Basketball Film
","A coach with a checkered past (Gene Hackman) and a local drunk (Dennis Hopper) train a small town high school basketball team to become a top contender for the championship.Although I am not one who cares for basketball or sports films (they all seem to follow the same general plot), this one does have some good things going for it. Namely, Gene Hackman, who never makes a bad movie (or at least never plays a bad role). And Dennis Hopper, who is something of a wild card and is appropriately cast as a drunk.Beyond that, it is just a feel good movie. Nothing too heavy, sort of the thing you expect from the 1980s. And that is just alright.",7,3,3,27 August 2015
Pulp Fiction," Considered Tarantino's Masterpiece... Set a New Standard
","Quentin Tarantino presents his masterpiece: interwoven tales of a washed-up boxer, some bodyguards to powerful crime kingpin, and others who cross their path on this fateful day. Featuring an all-star cast: John Travolta in his best role (relaunching his dead career), Sam Jackson in his defining role (still trying to outdo himself fourteen years later), Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth and more. (Many of these being Tarantino regulars, who work well with his idiosyncratic style.) How do I review a film so many people have praised, including my hero Roger Ebert? I could be a detractor and say its a bad film, but I'd be lying. I love the story and how it all plays out. I still prefer Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs', but this comes in a close second. (Sadly, I don't think he ever recovered after he became famous. Subsequent films -- 'Jackie Brown', 'Kill Bill' and 'Death Proof' -- all have a certain charm to them, but are not close to being on the level of 'Dogs' or 'Pulp'.) Although I've seen this movie, or at least bits of it, a dozen times, I think the most recent may be the most interesting. I watched it with a young woman who saw Bruce Willis and asked who he was. I said, 'Bruce Willis.' She asked who that was. I listed a few of his bigger films ('Die Hard', 'Armageddon', etc.) but she said she had not seen them. How a woman in her 20s does not know Bruce Willis or any of his movies is beyond me, but it got me wondering: would 'Pulp Fiction' be a different film if I didn't recognize the majority of the actors? Walken, for example, appeals to me because he's Walken. Would his monologue be as good if delivered by someone else or by Walken when I didn't know him by name? Curious thought.If you haven't seen 'Pulp Fiction', see it. Tarantino is a better writer than a director, but this film offers probably his best directing to date and some superb writing. He is very dialogue-intensive, which I think alienates some viewers (particularly in 'Death Proof'), but give him a fair shake. This film defined the 1990s and continues to be influential in film today. Pay attention and you'll be sure to see why.",9,2,5,18 June 2008
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Pure Bloody Genius
","Guy Ritchie has a skill: the skill to take multi-layered gangster plots, weave them together, and come out with a fabric of the finest quality. I first watched 'Snatch', which came after this film. Loved it. Watch this film, which had a similar set-up (the interwoven gangster theme). Loved it. As far as I'm concerned, if Ritchie can maintain this level of creativity, he can keep on making these films until the end of time. His characters are so well scripted and the actors so well chosen, there is a three-dimensional quality to this film, as if you can almost taste the sulfur in the shotgun blasts.To describe the plot is difficult, unless we choose one character as the hero and the rest as the anti-heroes... but that's hard to do. While certain people seem to be on our side, they're all equally involved in the plot. Kids playing poker, a porn king who cheats at cards, Big Chris the hired thug, the stereotyped black ganja dealer, Barry the Baptist... all great characters.Another aspect of Ritchie's films is that instead of good vs. evil, he offers us bad versus evil. All the characters do bad things: steal, drink, smoke dope and kill if necessary. But some are simply 'bad' (people who would be morally upright in a different setting) and others are 'evil' (no moral code at all, black all the way to the core of their heart). This almost non-dichotomy is probably not unique to Ritchie, but is something he excels in. Highest possible recommendation, you nonce!",10,3,5,21 February 2006
Les MisÃ©rables," A Visual Spectacle, Though Not My Cup of Tea
","In 19th-century France, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), who for decades has been hunted by the ruthless policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) after he breaks parole, agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's daughter, Cosette. The fateful decision changes their lives forever.Let me say that this film is visually stunning and for those who love the musical, I think they will be quite happy with the performances here. Tom Hooper has given our senses something to enjoy, and this may be his bet work yet (though I still prefer 'King's Speech').Hugh Jackman is a performer even more so than he is an actor. Maybe that is a fine distinction, but Jackman has singing and dancing in his blood. Sure, he made a name for himself as Wolverine (among other roles), but he also starred in 'Oklahoma' and other musicals. The world of 'Les Mis' is no foreign territory, and he shows this. I wish I could say the same for Russell Crowe, who was pale in comparison (though with Valjean as the hero, maybe this is okay).Stealing the show are Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen. Could two people have filled their roles better? I doubt it. They had too brief a time on screen to be seriously considered as supporting actors, I suppose, but I would still wish that honor upon them just the same.Which brings me to Anne Hathaway. I just do not care for her. I cannot say she is a bad actress and I cannot say she is a bad singer, but I did not care for her as Fantine and although she gave it 110%, I just do not have my heart in giving her an Oscar for this role. She has a Golden Globe and she is probably the Oscar front-runner, but I just do not see it. Although, I suppose this is the peak of her career (thus far).More than my personal dislike of Hathaway is my apathy towards the film in general. I never fully empathized with Valjean or any of the other characters. I like the historical context of France between the two revolutions (1789 and 1848) and I appreciate that the June Rebellion is included in the musical. But the overall story is Valjean's redemption, and the story is too broad and covers too much time.I know I am probably in the minority and those who love musicals are huge fans of 'Les Mis'. I like my share of musicals, but I just cannot get behind this one. I can accept it getting Oscars for sound mixing and visuals, but Anne Hathaway as best actress? No way. And best picture? It should never have been nominated.",7,1,5,11 February 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Average Book, Better Movie
","A murder inside the Louvre and clues in Leonardo paintings lead to the discovery of a religious mystery protected by a secret society for two thousand years -- which could shake the foundations of Christianity.I read the book when it first came out, and I have to say it was not a great book. It kept me turning pages and was a quick read, but I was catching errors on almost every page. Sure, you could day it is fiction and you can't have errors in fiction. But I disagree. If you are going to weave a convincing tale, at least the foundation needs to be firm, and the book had too many problems that could have been fixed and made a stronger book.This problem seems to be fixed in the movie, or at the very least it comes off as less of an issue. maybe we are more willing to go along with shaky plots in films? I mean, heck, we let 'National Treasure' slide, and it makes even less sense than this film does.

","A seventeen-year-old aristocrat (Kate Winslet), expecting to be married to a rich claimant (Billy Zane) by her mother, falls in love with a kind but poor artist (Leonardo DiCaprio) aboard the luxurious, ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic.The first thing that is really striking about this film is that it came from James Cameron, who is much better known for science fiction films like 'Terminator', 'Avatar' and 'Aliens'. He is not the first person that comes to mind when you think of historical fiction romances. And yet, he nailed it. 'Titanic', despite its length of three hours, was a huge success and may have sold more VHS copies than any other movie.But beyond the romance, this is actually a rather decent movie. I cannot say why, it is something hard to put one's finger on. Most likely, it has something to do with Billy Zane, who is more or less the greatest thing about the film.",7,2,2,11 May 2015
Rocky III," Such Fun!
","After winning the ultimate title and being the world champion, Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) falls into a hole and finds himself picked up by a former enemy (Carl Weathers).The first film was serious, the second one was more humorous and light-hearted. This one has a few emotional bumps (someone important dies), a bit of a humanization for Apollo Creed (sudden;y a good guy), and some over-the-top absurd humor (Thunder Lips). It is a good mix.Although few would agree, I believe the second film is superior to the first. The third is beneath both of them, but not by much. It is a welcome addition to the series, which they likely never thought would last nearly as long as it does.",7,0,0,12 August 2015
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Off to a Successful Start
","Rescued from the outrageous neglect of his aunt and uncle, a young boy with a great destiny proves his worth while attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.This is the film that started it all, and was, of course, a huge success. One might wonder what would happen if you had seven movies to make and the first one already flopped or was poorly done. But this did not happen. The crew was perfect, with a master of family films (Chris Columbus) at the helm. The casting could have been tricky, since they had to get children to act well on screen and then make sure they could keep them for a decade. Daniel Radcliffe proved to be perfect for the part, and Emma Watson does alright, too, despite overacting at times.The adult cast is fleshed out with plenty of solid choices, filling the void from serious, to silly to scary. Alan Rickman, who plays Snape, has a little bit of all three, and was really a crucial casting choice, and the costume department did their best to make him look like Trent Reznor. Perhaps they could have cast Reznor himself, but I suspect he does not have Rickman's range.Of all the films in the series, this is the lightest. There is a villain, but he plays a minor role. And there are some dangerous challenges, but overall the element of fun remains. These are 11-year old children, so there needs be no rush to push them into a world of life and death. And for those who have not read the books, this is our first time meeting everyone, so introductions and character development are important.",7,0,2,2 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Goblet of Fire The Last Great Harry Film
","I have now seen each of the Harry Potter films once, and never read the books. I have no desire to ever read the books, and if I ever see the movies again it will only be because some woman makes me (or if I have kids, but presumably they will have new movies by then). I say this as a way to explain my review, because my opinion will be different from a fan of the books.The best film in the series so far is the third one. And judging the fifth one by the director, I do not think we're going to see any change on that status for a few years. But this is the fourth film (the second worst behind part two) so let us discuss this one.This is the story of Harry Potter and the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Harry and three other wizards (including a hot French chick and a Bulgarian built like a brick scat-house) must face three dangerous missions. The subplot is that Harry, Ron and Hermione are now entering puberty and adolescence and want to start dating people. Only Harry has no self-confidence and Ron comes off being more scared of women than anything else. Hermione easily finds a date, and the bewitching hour is soon upon us.The best part of this film was the introduction of Ralph Fiennes, who decided to play the role of Lord Voldemort rather than film 'Maid in Manhattan 2: Back in the Bronx'. Fiennes is a truly gifted actor, and he will bring some needed talent to the future pictures (with all due respect to the great Alan Rickman). I also enjoyed the special effects -- the creators of this film used them as much as possible without overdoing it. They assisted the plot rather than the plot assisting the effects. Too many films make this mistake, and I am glad this was not one of them.So why do I rank this the second worst of the first four? Because if I were to chart the climaxes of this film on a chart, it would look like a heart monitor of someone with a normal heartbeat: every so often a brief problem would arise and a quick solution was found. Nothing ever is given time to build up. And the end is worst of all -- rather than taking what should be the key moment to hype up the story, it just fades off into a happy cowboy-in-the-sunset scene. I was left completely unfulfilled and felt like the vast majority of this movie was filler between the third and fifth films, because almost none of the things in this movie will matter for the remainder of the series. But maybe you like to be unfulfilled, maybe you are a movie masochist.The fifth one comes across as even more of a bridge, though, making this one seem better in hindsight. And the inclusion of Robert Pattinson is sure to please a particular group of people, even if his role is not as major as it should have been (though at this point, who knew).",7,0,0,8 January 2006
Thor," Surprisingly Good
","The powerful but arrogant warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is cast out of the fantastic realm of Asgard and sent to live amongst humans on Earth, where he soon becomes one of their finest defenders.I have enjoyed Thor as a supporting and humorous character in the past -- both in 'Adventures in Babysitting' and one of the early Hulk movies. But I was never convinced he could be the leading character... his story is a strange one outside of Norse mythology.But here, I think it worked. For me, the biggest concern is how do you reconcile Thor being a god with the other gods of the world? For Christians, there is only one god, so calling Thor a god calls everything into question (in the Marvel Universe). But they made it work here by strongly suggesting he is not, in fact, a god, but was merely seen as one by the old Norse people because his strength was so superior to theirs. Nice save.",7,8,16,12 May 2012
Three Colors: Blue," A Truly Visual Film
","A woman (Juliette Binoche) struggles to find a way to live her life after the death of her husband and child.Nothing against the plot, but this is a visual film. As with the other two films in the trilogy, the color of the title features prominently in the color scheme. Here, unlike 'White', the blues (and greens) jump out everywhere without being overwhelming. The elements are intense, but well-used.Does it compare to 'Red'? Based on what everyone seems to think, it does not. But everyone should make up their own minds -- watch all three.",7,0,0,29 December 2014
Castle in the Sky," Sky Pirates
","A young boy and a girl with a magic crystal must race against pirates and foreign agents in a search for a legendary floating castle.The general plot of the film is pretty interesting, with its sky themes and pirates. Was this an influence on Disney's 'Tailspin'? The voice actors are all quite good, though it is curious that somehow Andy Dick was hired.Composer Joe Hisaishi was commissioned to rework and extend his original synthesizer-composed 39-minute soundtrack into a 90-minute piece for symphony orchestra in an effort to make the film more accessible to US audiences who are accustomed to a more substantial musical accompaniment. Newer sound effects were included as well, presumably to bring the film up to theatrical standards. Mayhaps the original would not be rated quite so high were it not for this improved score?",6,2,4,10 February 2015
The Untouchables," Complete Fiction, But a Fun Movie
","Federal Agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) sets out to stop Al Capone (Robert DeNiro); because of rampant corruption, he assembles a small, hand-picked team.The film starts with a beautiful opening shot, showing why Brian DePalma is a legendary director who knows colors and angles and how to make things seem larger than life. He continues this throughout the film, making everything look golden.Historically, I think the movie fails. This is really more a film version of the television series than a film version of any real events. Some things, like the ledger and the jury switch, are based on reality. But the Frank Nitti here is nothing like the real Nitti, and to present Ness and Capone as bitter enemies is not particularly accurate -- the men never met.",7,0,1,21 January 2013
The Godfather: Part III," Great Sequel, Retains the Look and Feel
","In the midst of trying to legitimize his business dealings in 1979 New York and Italy, aging mafia don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) seeks to vow for his sins while taking a young protÃ©gÃ© under his wing.As difficult as it might be to have a good sequel, and harder still to have a good follow-up to that, I think this film has succeeded. By retaining the look, feel and cast -- while introducing strong new actors -- we have the 'Godfather' story continued on even further. Perhaps even a fourth might have worked? There is something about redemption that takes the gangster story and makes it real, and especially in the third act of an epic series. Does Michael Corleone repent? Is he faking? Can he buy his way into Heaven? I am not the one to judge, but if a mafioso can go legit, Michael will try his best to do it.",8,1,3,20 May 2011
The Fountain," This Will Go Down As Darren Aronofsky's Masterpiece
","Darren Aronofsky previously gave us 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream', both excellent films in their own right. Now, he brings us 'The Fountain' which does the impossible -- ups the ante on what a good Aronofsky film should be. This is, beyond a doubt, his best film to date and possibly ever.Hugh Jackson is a man in three parallel story lines: a Spanish conquistador in search of the Tree of Life, a cancer researcher who finds a cure for aging (while his wife slowly dies) and a spiritually reflecting man of the future, pondering the nature of life. He is almost unrecognizable as the same actor in these roles, which is a real credit to Jackman. He is often quickly seen as Wolverine (from the 'X-Men' films), but he has finally escaped that here.While the plot and characters here are not the deepest, they are some of the most emotional you'll ever come across. And the scenery -- my science, this is just breathtakingly beautiful. Using chemicals rather than CGI, the film overcomes the flaw of CGI (the cartoon look) and steps us up to a whole new level of expectations. How this film did not get an Oscar for cinematography or special effects is a mystery. No other film (not even 'Pan's Labyrinth') could replicate this quality.There are parts where the viewer probably won't know what's going on. The ending is very arty and open to interpretation. The first five or ten minutes won't make sense until later on in the movie and probably need a second viewing (if you walk into this film blind you'll be very confused for the first fifteen minutes). I could fault the film for this, but when I left the movie I felt I understood everything I had to: this was a visual representation of love, life and god. Which, I guess, isn't really that strange from Aronofsky.I give the film a 9.6 out of 10 (rounded up to 10). I think everyone ought to see it. You might not like it. You might not understand it. But I think if you give it a chance, you'll be moved. My friend Jason, the biggest fan of the film I know, didn't really love it until the second viewing. Give it a fair shake -- this is one of those films you wait years for, and if you miss it now, you'll regret it.",10,2,5,7 June 2007
Mystic River," Powerfully Compelling Film
","I always look forward to getting to see films in the Top 250... they're generally voted there for a reason (besides the Lord of the Rings films). This one was so well put together, the characters so intricately intertwined... I was glued to my screen in suspense.Clint Eastwood is not a name I associate with directing, but this view is changing. I would rather watch something he directed these days than some film where he just shoots people (with all due respect to Dirty Harry). Can anyone else put together a tale of Boston kids together like this and expose the gritty reality of life? Because Matt Damon is not going to do it.As kids, Jimmy, Sean and Dave were playing when one of them (Dave) is kidnapped. Years later, Jimmy is in a mob, Sean is a cop and Dave is mentally unstable. When the mob man 's daughter is killed, evidence points to Dave. Will the cop be able to solve the crime before the mafia kills Dave? And is Dave even really the killer, or is he telling the truth about the mugger? (If you're confused, just watch. It makes more sense.)Sean Penn is always walking a fine line with me, but he is excellent in this film. More mob roles should be in his future and less military roles. Kevin Bacon is Kevin Bacon, which for me is a good thing. Tim Robbins excels. He has always been great, but this time he really outdoes himself.Watch three lives come together and slowly get torn apart. It's gritty, it's real and it's amazing. A special shout-out to Emmy Rossum who was great and should be in more big films (but probably won't be), and Laura Linney who is always great. After 'Kinsey' and 'Life of David Gale', it's nice to see her in something less erotic.Rent this film... don't be fooled by the title, it has nothing to do with 'Mystic Pizza'.",8,1,2,26 July 2006
Zombieland," Not Quite 'Shaun of the Dead', But the Next Best Thing
","After the zombie apocalypse (allegedly brought on by a mutation in mad cow disease), few humans are left to wander the earth, a place now called 'Zombieland'. Four of them are skilled zombie hunters who go by the names Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita and Little Rock. These are their first adventures as a unit, with all the tragedy and romance that comes with it. And the most important objective: find the last remaining Hostess Twinkie.Rookie director Ruben Fleischer has done a fine job with 'Zombieland', blending comedy and more than our fair share of gore. If you don't like blood, you're watching the wrong movie. Plenty of blood spewing and dripping from every orifice, even by the time the opening credits roll. Gorehounds with a funny bone are going to lick this one up like a dripping ice cream cone.The cast is pretty much perfectly chosen: Abigail Breslin, Emma Stone, Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg bring together the sort of team of gritty yet lovable leftovers that could survive in a world full of zombies. There's really nothing to complain about them, aside from Eisenberg's delivery of Columbus' annoying voiceovers. Those got old fast.I have to give credit to Amber Heard, who played the smaller role of '406'. I really found her to be a burden in 'The Stepfather', and in desperate need of clothes and lunch. But, mysteriously, in 'Zombieland' her acting seemed better and she was fairly attractive -- while being fully clothed. I would like to see more of this Amber Heard, especially in the horror genre.I heard that the humor peters out in the second half, and I absolutely agree with this analysis. Not to say the second half was bad, but the jokes got a bit repetitive and I lost interest in the list of rules that Columbus keeps. I found the ongoing search for Twinkies funny and I'm glad that remained steady throughout the film. I'm unsure how I feel about the film's romantic factors: too much or too little? I have to give them credit for not getting smutty, though I wouldn't mind more skin from Emma Stone.After draft writing my own review for this film, I read the other Killer Review from my Canadian colleague Greg Roberts. I had expected a vastly different outlook, but it appears we're on the same page here. Greg says, 'The story is weak and routine... Harrelson's character gets the best one liners but the Eisenberg voice over narrative is too annoying and reminded me of Adventureland (hmmmmm)... I enjoyed the fun the characters seemed to be having during the shooting and there is a cameo that could have been done better, but is still a hoot all the same... It will make you laugh and keep you entertained. It just won't make any top 10 lists when it is done.' Greg is dead on with the cameo. I thought it was a clever idea, but didn't really impress me the way I hoped it would.The creators expressed some concerns about piracy and the sequel. Allegedly the film was downloaded at a record pace, which made the sequel less likely. Believe it or not, Internet piracy does affect the entertainment industry. Luckily, even with all the illegal copies, enough people went to the theater and a sequel seems inevitable. But it's a lesson worth learning: you do need to support films you like. If you are going to pirate (and I'm not saying you should), get chick flicks.This film is: Recommended. I can see it gaining a growing status in years to come.",8,0,1,6 December 2009
It's a Wonderful Life," Holiday Classic
","An angel (Henry Travers) helps a compassionate but despairingly frustrated businessman (Jimmy Stewart) by showing what life would have been like if he never existed.After almost seventy years, and getting played over and over on television, you might think people have grown tired of this film. And yet, as of 2014, it seems to be appreciated more than ever. Not that it is a flawless film. The editing, for example, is pretty rotten. And critical, it is probably not a great film, especially alongside 'The Best Years of Our Lives', which came out around the same time. But this film really hits the heart.There are some parallels here with 'A Christmas Carol', only now it is Bob Cratchitt who is the one in a need of a visit from a supernatural friend. The message is different, but also very much the same.",7,1,4,7 December 2014
Enemy at the Gates," Mano a Mano, Sniper to Sniper
","'Enemy at the Gates' is set in the second World War, on the border between the Soviet Union and Germany (actually, more in the Soviet Union, as the Germans have reached Stalingrad). But the story is of one man, a farm boy who has grown up to be a sharp-shooter. We see his skill, his love, and his adversary.This film is fairly interesting because, from America's point of view, neither Germany or Russia was really the 'good guy', even if we officially had Russia on our side. But here we focus on a man, who like any other soldier or even any human, has the same struggles and feelings. So, we can't help but feel sympathy for him, even if we want to dislike the Russians. (I, for one, do not identify any one person with their country, but it's easy to do.) The commissar tries to paint things on a national level, saying that the sniper conflict is 'not just a war of countries, but class struggle' because the Russian is a farm boy and the German went to good schools. How much any Soviet citizen or official took this sort of view seriously, I don't know. To me, it sounds flaky. The Soviet Union had very little to do with class struggle after the first few years, and I'm fairly certain everyone knew that. But, I could be wrong.Another piece of wisdom bestowed in the film is: 'In the forest, the wolf lives for three years, the donkey for nine.' They explain this means that the more useful creature ought to live longer, justifying the uneducated getting sent to war so the educated can keep society running. There are so many things that can be said about this... I don't even know where to begin. But it's very interesting.",8,1,3,13 May 2010
A Beautiful Mind," Russell Crowe Can Act?
","After a brilliant but asocial mathematician (Russell Crowe) accepts secret work in cryptography, his life takes a turn for the nightmarish.I was sold when Nash began expounding on Adam Smith, and how everyone acting in their own self-interest works best for all. Effectively, he made a good argument for price fixing... only applied to dating. His thoughts on game theory are pretty incredible.The story gets more interesting as Nash gets more mentally ill. It is in many ways a precursor to 'The Imitation Game' (2014), and both are excellent films about mathematicians. Maybe not a great double feature, but excellent for comparison.",7,1,3,16 February 2015
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," A Movie For The Greatest Band in the World
","Young Jack Black leaves home to start a career in rock. He meets Kyle Gass, and together they go in search of the Pick of Destiny, a legendary guitar pick that allowed rock stars to play the greatest songs in the history of music. But someone else also wants the pick: Satan.This film has one major flaw: much of it is just a rehash of past songs, music videos and the television show. Dave Grohl has already appeared as Satan, Sasquatch (played by John C. Reilly) has already been their drummer, they found silver-striped mushrooms in 'Jesus Ranch'... so the writing of this film probably only took about twenty minutes, which is sad because it showed up about five years after the peak of their popularity. Can I blame director Liam Lynch ('Sifl and Olly', 'Jesus is Magic')? Maybe not...Disregarding that flaw, I really loved this. There were some stupid parts, but the film worked well as a musical and the tunes kept the plot flowing smoothly. I already thought I fell in love with it after the first five minutes: Meat Loaf as Jack Black's religious father (perfect), a kid who looks exactly like Black playing him as a youngster (perfect), and then the arrival of Dio (more perfect than perfect). Throw in Tim Robbins later (one of the greatest actors of my our time) and you have a real winner in the cameo department (did I mention Ben Stiller or Amy Poehler or Colin Hanks?).If you don't like Tenacious D, you might not like the humor of this film. I really can't say, as I already really enjoy the music of the D. Not sure I think Jack Black is a great actor (he's a bit obnoxious), but I can't deny he plays a fairly accurate Jack Black...If you are a fan, or are willing to be, give this one a try. Unless you have an absolute hatred for the D, I think you'll like it. I was sober and I liked it. At least, I think I was sober. Anyway, it's a million times better than 'Envy' (which I just reviewed), so if you liked that, this is liable to rock your flipping socks off.",7,1,2,2 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," And the Series Continues...
","Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) ignores warnings not to return to Hogwarts, only to find the school plagued by a series of mysterious attacks and a strange voice haunting him.With Chris Columbus still directing, this film maintains much of the element of fun the first film had. The danger is upped a bit with the inclusion of some 'creature violence' that may be scary for younger viewers. But, overall, these are still kids (12-year olds now). The best addition to this cast is the girl who plays Moaning Myrtle, whose name I unfortunately do not know.I find this one to be the least memorable of the first few films. While it has some important parts to it -- such as establishing the Malfoy family's dark connections and introducing Tom Riddle, Dobby and Moaning Myrtle -- the overall story is relatively uninteresting. Those who see the later films or have read the books will tell you that Ginny Weasley, who plays a prominent role here, will come back in a big way later, so it is important to make her a focus. And I agree, but they still only make casual references to her despite her centrality to the plot.One positive note about its being less than memorable is that the film has a healthy dose of mystery and suspense, and although I watched it a second time barely a year ago, I had already forgotten much of it by my third viewing. There was also much going on that I did not realize was important in the long run...",7,0,0,2 May 2011
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," So Much Better Than The Previews Would Have You Believe
","John Smith and Jane Smith has the perfect marriage. Well, not quite so perfect. And they've been keeping secrets from each other. They work for rival firms that do outsourcing work for the CIA. (Sadly, this would be better if viewers didn't know this for the first twenty minutes of the film, but the previews already gave it away.) Based on the preview, I thought this would be a Pitt-Jolie lovefest. I have enjoyed many of Pitt's films but not so many of Jolie's. And together, it was like a showcase of perfection for the American masses. Do I need to be reminded I'll never be handsome or rich? (Some will say movies help us escape this, and maybe it does, but still...) My concerns were unfounded. This movie is well-acted, well-directed and well-written. The story is layered and brilliant, as well as quite funny. The direction fits well. The acting is superb, some of the best from Brad Pitt yet. And the explosions and gunfire and things breaking and high-tech gadgets? Very nice - someone put a lot into this film and/or has some natural talent I hope we see more of in Hollywood.I don't know if this film is PG-13 or R. I heard it was PG-13 because a sex scene was cut. Well, let me say: you should have kept the scene and kept the R. With all the excessive violence (really over the top) and the cussing, a little smut isn't going to make much difference. I mean, as an action film, I expect a solid R rating (look at Bruce Willis and 'Die Hard' or 'Hostage').No real complaints about this movie. I really want to say something bad, but I cannot. I was entertained the whole time and found the film very persuasively believable. I don't know who wrote or directed this (I guess I could check, but I didn't) but they just scored points in my book. Unless it was Michael Bay, but I'm pretty sure he had nothing to do with this.",8,52,83,17 December 2006
The Departed," Without a Doubt, The Movie of the Year in 2006
","I saw The Departed last night, and already expecting a great movie I got even more: the BEST movie. I officially declare this the best movie of 2006, without a doubt.Jack Nicholson plays an Irish mafia boss, who is hunted by a rat in his mob. He also has a gang member who is a rat in the police department. The two rats do not know about each others' double identities. With Matt Damon, Leo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and more...What is great is not just the great double embedded story, but the way the two chase each other without knowing who to target. And the acting is phenomenal.Jack Nicholson returns as a villain and is the most evil and ruthless he's ever been (compare to 'Batman' or 'The Shining'). DiCaprio is intense, and delivers some of the best fight scenes captured on film. You will believe assault can be an art form. Matt Damon is in top form. Wahlberg is the most Irish you'll ever see him. And Martin Sheen is the father figure he obviously wasn't in real life.I want to pay special attention to the music. Twice, they use the Dropkick Murphys' cover of Woody Guthrie's 'I'm Shipping Off to Boston'. Once when Leo goes to jail and again later when the mafia marches into battle. This tune is loud, intense and violent... pure perfection. Scorsese could have just used incidental music, but he knows when to get a modern rock song and this was one of those times.Go see this movie and love every minute of it, just like I did.",9,3,6,20 October 2006
Die Hard," Greatest Action Film of All Time?
","John McClane (Bruce Willis), officer of the NYPD, tries to save wife Holly Gennaro and several others, taken hostage by German terrorist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles.This was the debut of Alan Rickman, the film that cemented Bruce Willis' career as an action star, and possibly the greatest action of film of all time (or at the very least, the 1980s). While it could have become dated, it has not -- not in the slightest.As I write this (December 2013), there is a new 'Red Dawn' where the Soviets were replaced with North Koreans. The original is now a time capsule. 'Die Hard' remains timeless because the terrorists were 'European' and not tied to any particular ideology or movement. This was a wise decision.",8,1,4,2 December 2013
Psycho," So Influential, It Makes My Head Spin
","A young woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 (roughly a quarter million today) from her employer and runs off to meet her boyfriend. But along the way she stops at the Bates Motel, and meets the charming Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Marion and her money might not make it back to her boyfriend Sam in perfect condition.Yes, after 47 years of this film existing and being a horror fan for well over 10 years now, I finally broke down and watched what is widely considered to be Hitchcock's best film (I had previously seen 'Lamb to Slaughter', 'Rear Window' and 'Vertigo' -- and have now seen many more since). Boy, was I missing out on something! Now I cannot wait to see 'Psycho 2' and 'Psycho 3' (which I own for some reason). I have seen parts of the Gus Van Sant remake but was not impressed.The acting was very good, especially from Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates). He did a great job as a friendly boy-next-door caretaker. Vivian Leigh was also good as Marion Crane, and I am sorry she had to have a hermaphroditic child like Jamie Lee Curtis. All other parts were fine. I hear they called the actor who played Sam Loomis 'the stiff' and boy are they right! Later in the film he loosens up a little bit, but in the opening scene he seems so wooden.The bird symbolism is nice... especially with Hitchcock's other big horror film being 'The Birds'. And the main character being Marion 'Crane'? Is she going to get stuffed like the other birds in the parlor? I will not say, but you probably already know (since pretty much everyone knows about this film even if they never saw it).Most startling for me was Bernard Herrmann's score, particularly the main theme (not the knife noise). I had long heard rumors that 'Re-Animator' ripped off the 'Psycho' theme and I thought they meant it was a variation on the theme. An homage, perhaps (because who would try to steal from such a famous film). Well, the music is exactly the same. I mean, really dead on. So now I do not know how to feel about 'Re-Animator', which is practically my favorite horror film (with all due respect to 'The Janitor')... which shakes up my whole foundation and makes me rethink movie history! My only complaint was the confusion (at least for me) of where the Bates Motel is. Marion drives all Friday night and then arrives Saturday evening, implying it is a great distance from Phoenix. Yet, when the detective investigates the motel, he tells someone on the phone he is less than an hour from them. Where is he based if not Phoenix?Well, if you have not seen this, you should. It is a classic and with good reason (as I typed this the first time, it was ranked the 22nd greatest film of all time on Internet Movie Database and still lingers around 25th three years later). Not just a great horror classic, but also a great film with great directing and cast. Plus, if you are from Wisconsin like I am, you'll love the Ed Gein storyline. (Incidentally, if you have never visited Ed Gein's hometown or grave, you should. It is a good time.)",9,2,4,12 January 2007
The Witch," A Defining Witch Film
","A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.There are not many films about witches (as opposed to other horror villains). There are even fewer that are actually rather good. And also very few set in the time when witches were still very much believed to exist in the real world. This film is not only very good, but crafts an entire world -- a Salem-ish environment where it is not hysteria but reality.While there is not much that could be said bad about this film, there is one thing I would like to single out above all else fr praise. The sound design. Wow. The colors, the costumes, the acting and more are all good, but this film is very rich in sound in ways hat we very rarely hear. Not just in horror but anywhere, and it is a real shame that movies like this are not often noticed by the Academy.",7,0,2,10 July 2017
Rosemary's Baby," The Biggest Satanic Cult Film Ever Made?

Once his luck improves, Rosemary is pregnant and her pregnancy becomes more and more unbearable and her neighbors even more and more strange and intruding. What is going on in this apartment? I want to say Mia Farrow was pretty hot in this movie. I don't know why. I mean, she's really not all that hot, and for a good part of the movie she has very short hair which is generally very unattractive on women. Even Guy tells Rosemary that her haircut is the biggest mistake she ever made (and I'm inclined to agree). Yet, you got me Mia... well played.I'm also concerned about the film's anti-Semitism. I've never heard anyone accuse the film of anti-Semitism before, but it seemed possible to me. The satanic doctor had a Jewish-sounding name and the satanic neighbor lady had a very stereotypical Jewish manner about her. Now, it's never stated anyone is Jewish, but it seems to me like that is what Polanski was hinting at. Which is very odd, having Jews be running a Satanic cult to harm Catholic women. I mean, having a cult is one thing, but a Jewish devil-worshiping cult seems like a bad idea.Anyway, this film is of course very good. It's now roughly forty years old and still a classic by both horror and general cinema standards. And I'm not going to say the people who have judged it so are wrong. It really broke ground in some ways. A rape scene involving Satan? You don't see that a lot in movies, at least not in movies that many mainstream people watch. Which is perhaps too bad. I like a good bit of devil rape every now and then.But yeah, the plot is good, the acting good (Rosemary comes off as really naive and far too submissive, but it was the 1960s so I guess that happens). The suspense was very nice, and although the audience is usually two steps ahead of Rosemary in figuring things out, it's nice to see her come across the twists and turns -- is she going mad or is there really something dark lurking under every cradle? Watch this film, if for no other reason than to see D'Urville Martin ('Dolemite') or hear the voice of Tony Curtis. Or wonder why Mia Farrow can maintain a hotness with short hair. There's no real nudity, no real gore (in fact, none). But this is classic story-telling at its finest. I watched it again in honor of writer Ira Levin's passing, but you don't need a special occasion to enjoy this one.",8,2,4,25 November 2007
When Harry Met Sally...," Fun, But Too Much Like a Romantic Comedy
","Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) have known each other for years, and are very good friends, but they fear sex would ruin the friendship.This film has become iconic, in part for the scene of Sally 'faking it', and for its bigger question: can a man and a woman be strictly friends? The answer is one that is open to debate, but no movie is better known for tackling the subject than this one is.And does it answer the question? Well, you have to watch the movie. We cannot give that away. But, unfortunately, despite being a Rob Reiner comedy, it tends to get a bit too close to the 'romantic comedy' (no doubt because of Nora Ephron's script). This may make it more divisive and less enjoyable a watch for men.",6,1,2,23 April 2015
Zero Dark Thirty," An Epic Tale of Current Events and Foreign Policy
","A chronicle of the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the September 2001 attacks, and his death at the hands of the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 in May 2011.If you look through the message boards on IMDb, you will find accusations of 'jingoism' and 'American propaganda' concerning this film. Now, I did not read through the arguments made by these individuals, so maybe they had some valid points. But nowhere in the film did I think this was a propaganda attempt to make America look great. Few people are as critical of American foreign policy as I am (at least in this country), and what I saw was a general presentation of the facts. Agree or disagree with the tactics and methods, but this was probably more or less what actually happened.This film was nominated by the Academy for Best Picture, Best Actress (Jessica Chastain) and Best Original Screenplay. Let us explore these nominations briefly.As far as the Best Picture is concerned, I think the nomination is fair, as this is an epic film and well-made. This could easily made anyone's 'top ten of 2012' list, so I will not argue against the nomination. However, I find it highly unlikely it will win. (Actually, I am still unclear how 'Hurt Locker' won.) The picture is great, but not flawless. My biggest issue is actually a personal complaint -- the casting of Chris Pratt. Seeing him only as Andy from 'Parks and Recreation', I found it hard to take him seriously as the leader of Seal Team Six.Moving on to Jessica Chastain, it pains me to say that she does not deserve this nomination. Chastain is an exceptional actress and has made a name for herself over the last few years, going from unknown to A-list in record time thanks to roles in 'Tree of Life' and 'Take Shelter', among others. But this was not an ideal role for her. Every time she cussed, I cringed inside. Some people cuss naturally and some do not -- Chastain does not, and it made it hard for me to believe she was this person. In general, she hardly seemed the part. An intelligent spy, sure... but she seemed so out of place during the 'heavy' scenes.Now that I have been critical, I feel ready to heap some praise. And that comes with the Best Original Screenplay. Not only was this clearly deserving of the nomination, but it probably has a solid chance of winning. The script was dense, detailed, covered a wide range of places and people. The research that went into such a script is immeasurable. This attention to detail allows the film to work on two levels, too. The general audience (ignorant of world affairs) can see it as a hunt for bin Laden. Those who are more aware of the situation will be able to take in terms like ISI, KSM and various other factoids that the characters spout in reckless abandon. There really is a narrative here, despite the film being called plot less by many (including the Great Ebert).This is not a feel good movie, and it is not the kind of film that I will probably watch a second time. And heck, it might give the false impression that killing Osama bin Laden actually stops terror, which is a terrible mistake. Yet, it is a well-made picture and worth seeing. I fully endorse it.",8,1,10,18 February 2013
Steve Jobs," Incredible Dialogue, And An Interesting Take
","Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, to paint a portrait of the man at its epicenter. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.Thismay be the most interesting way to tell the story of Steve Jobs. We see almost nothing about his life or who he was, other than what we get from his interactions with his daughter, his assistant and Steve Wozniack. Although it leaves a lot out, it is still surprisingly effective.And what we have is a very limited arc, from failures to success. We never get beyond 1998, so there is no iPod, iPad, iPhone or any of the things that have since made Apple a giant in the tech field. But again, this makes for some interesting storytelling.",7,1,1,14 March 2016
Crazy Heart," Second Best Jeff Bridges in a Bowling Alley Movie
","A faded country music musician (Jeff Bridges) is forced to reassess his dysfunctional life during a doomed romance that also inspires him.Jeff Bridges has had a really good career. Some highs, some lows. But even the lows are better than most actors' lows. Can you think of a bad movie he was in? Now, did he deserve Best Actor for this picture? Maybe not. But it did allow him to showcase a bit of his depth and breadth, as well as his musical ability.For pure entertainment, this is certainly no 'Big Lebowski' or 'Tron', and will probably not go down in history as one of the films Bridges is remembered for (despite the Oscar).",6,0,2,15 July 2015
War of the Worlds," Wake Me Up When Spielberg Ends
","This movie was not good. The acting was decent, but not great (besides Tim Robbins, but he's only in the film for 10 minutes). The directing was weak and very Spielbergian in its traditional and clichÃ© feel. The ending is so stupid. Things happen which are completely unbelievable - characters are resurrected from the dead. And the word 'Anti-climatic' can not be said enough. Every time you get an ounce of suspense you get another 20 minutes of boredom. Don't expect a shocker ending, you'll be lucky to still be awake at that point. Did I mention Dakota Fanning? I really hate her. And Tom Cruise? He was good, I guess, although I'd rather see Denzel Washington. He's the only man who knows how to protect Dakota. The one good thing? The gallons and gallons of blood in this film - its a BLOODFEST. But I don't feel that makes it worth watching. Not recommended - strictly for the tardcore.",4,5,9,10 December 2005
All Quiet on the Western Front," A Bit Theatrical and Blunt, But Good
","A young soldier (Lew Ayres) faces profound disillusionment in the soul-destroying horror of World War I.Early in the film, the characters discuss the causes of war... one country 'offends' another, but what does that mean? If nobody wants war, why do we have it? Of course, there are reasons, but it can all seem a bit silly.Because of the period this was made, there is plenty of over the top, theatrical acting. And the anti-war message is so incredibly blunt, it almost cannot be taken seriously at times. Not that I disagree with the film and what was trying to say, but if these young men are dying, the horrors of war do not actually need to be explained out loud.",7,1,2,23 December 2014
Love Actually," More Than a Christmas Movie
","Follows the lives of eight very different couples in dealing with their love lives in various loosely interrelated tales all set during a frantic month before Christmas in London, England.This movie tries to pass itself off as a Christmas movie. And I suppose it is, at least as much as 'Die Hard'. But it is really something more and can be watched at any time (I watched it in March). This is a great script with characters who cross paths in unexpected ways. Yes, it is a story of love, but it is also just a good story.What was most interesting was waiting until now (2016) to see it. At the time it came out, Andrew Lincoln was (I believe) largely unknown. And now with 'The Walking Dead', he is an international star. Seeing him in this role is such a treat, especially considering how rarely we hear him use his real voice.",7,1,3,7 March 2016
12 Years a Slave," The Most Honest Look at Slavery?
","In the antebellum United States, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery.No film from 2013 has been more rewarded and awarded than '12 Years a Slave', and with good reason -- an incredible (yet true) plot fleshed out by some remarkable actors that really captures what slavery was like without the gratuitous violence of exploitation or the overt sentimentality of a Spielberg film. There is no surprise that the film has captured the top slot in many critics' lists and enters the Oscar race with an impressive nine nominations.Right off the bat let us say that if '12 Years a Slave' wins Best Picture at the Academy Awards, there is no shame in that. This is the kind of film that deserves to win, as it both looks good and covers a topic of great importance. Slavery may not be in the forefront of our minds, but it is always a part of American history we have to live with. That is why I think this film will take the statuette home.After that, the race gets a lot more complicated. A win for adapted screenplay seems fair, as this story more than adequately brings to life historical figures in a way that comes across -- dare I say it -- entertaining, while also being honest and truthful to the source.But a best actor for Chiwetel Ejiofor? This is hard to say. While no one would argue he did not deserve such an award, he happens to be up against Matthew McConaughey in 'Dallas Buyers Club'. For both men, this is the role that will be the peak of their careers most likely, and I have to say McConaughey gave just a little bit more. So the edge is slight but evident.The exact same situation awaits Michael Fassbender, who was devious as Edwin Epps without becoming a caricature. He is this year's Christoph Waltz, which is quite the feat. But against Jared Leto? Again, the edge tends to favor the actor who put his own physical health on the line, and I think Fassbender will come in second.Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey could get an award. The actress fields are not as strong this year as in the past, and it would be a good time to sneak in past the more established people in the field. (Although her role is small, I was also pleased to see QuvenzhanÃ© Wallis as Margaret Northup. Regardless of how everything turned out, 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' was the film of 2012 thanks to her.) The only really disappointing thing was the presence of Brad Pitt as Bass, the film's hero (if there is one). Whether or not his acting was good, the part seemed all wrong. Pitt stands out as too recognizable in this world, and when he appears it is as if out of nowhere, proudly talking down his employer with repercussions. Was this necessary? Did we need what amounts to a 21st century man breaking the fourth wall to save the day?That nitpick aside, this is an excellent film and deserves any and all honors that come its way.",8,4,8,23 February 2014
30 Days of Night," Despite Some Bad Casting, a Well-Made Film
","In Barrow, Alaska the sun sets for an entire month and the villagers are given 30 days of night... most of them are smart enough to leave for Anchorage, giving this town a population of 152 brave souls. But this year, they have visitors: a clan of ancient vampires has staked out the town and wants nothing more than to spend the next thirty days gnawing and clawing through every living thing in sight. How do you kill the undead? This film received some unbelievably high ratings. For my first viewing (in the theater), I was expecting a decent but not amazing film... with the excessive level of advertising, I had to figure they were going to inflate the box office numbers (something often reserved for less than wonderful films). I left the theater unfulfilled: a film that seems to have one of the best ideas imaginable made by a team that seemingly did not know how to make a horror film. Too stylized, too clean...We have Josh Hartnett as Eben Oleson and Melissa George as Stella Oleson, the husband-wife sheriff combination, who are having marital problems. They are just annoying. The pretty boy marries the pretty girl and they run the town full of ugly people? Thanks, Hollywood. Oh, they have family problems but are forced to love each other by a crisis? Thanks, Hollywood. Oh, Hartnett is going to be clean-shaven and wearing a light coat in sub-zero temperatures so he looks cute? Thanks, Hollywood. By far some of the worst casting... The vampires were a major problem for me. They walk around with blank stares on their faces, over-acting their parts (what are those faces). The leader occasionally spouts a line of nonsense philosophy. They screech and screech non-stop. Okay, I get it, you screech. You are annoying me. And they run really fast (which would not be bad, except a sizable bulk of the action happens so fast you never see it). I prefer sleek, intelligent vampires (Anne Rice or Bram Stoker variety) over ravaging monsters.I am also unsure about the 'thirty days'... the film really only takes place over about four days. Where are the other twenty-six? Apparently they sit for five days, act on one day, and sit for another five days. Am I really to assume no one tries to fight the vampires for long periods of time? I understand the concept was 'thirty days' but this really did not play into it (nobody was starving or thirsty, for example).I have ripped on it enough, let me say a few good things: Ben Foster plays the Stranger. I am not sure if I loved his acting, but I loved his character, and could have used more development on him. Early on he comes across as a Crazy Ralph knock-off, talking about death, doom and gloom. But he becomes a Renfield-like character and gets interesting. I wanted more of this, but never really got it.The music was good -- actually very good (I liked the battle march), and as my colleague Greg Roberts says, the cinematography was nice. I do not know about great, but one scene really stood out as awesome -- an overhead shot of the city being destroyed. It was amazing and made me want to play a video game version of this film. There is also a good shot of what an ax does to a man's head, but that only made me wonder why I did not get more of that action if they were capable.The most bittersweet scene was with a vampire girl. Children are good villains, especially evil vampire children. But they did not keep her around very long and introduced her with the most off-putting, unnatural line in the film ('Want to play with me now?'). I could understand maybe 'Anyone else want to play?' or 'I want to play with someone else', but her self-referencing herself as having turned into a killer was just really stupid and poorly delivered.Give me this film with more blood, more shots of actual violence (instead of doing it lightning speed or off the screen), less family drama, less slow build up. And do not give me Hartnett and George without at least dirtying them up (though I admit Hartnett was great in 'Black Dahlia'). This film had more potential than most films coming out today, but squandered it all to be a Hollywood film.Update: Apparently my memories are fonder than my first impression. I went to my second viewing at House of Horrors in Oshkosh and sat down recalling a flawed but overly enjoyable film. After it was over, it was even better than I remembered. Reading this review, I am not sure what caused me to be so harsh on a David Slade and Sam Raimi film. I still think the casting was bad and the girl vampire was stupid, but the overall vampire feel is good and the cinematography is breath-taking. I had to bump this review up just a notch or two.",7,5,11,20 October 2007
Sausage Party," Far Better Than It Should Be
","Frank is a sausage who has always wanted to be purchased and 'go home,' but he does not yet know the truth. What he does not know is that his kind is used as a snack and he strives to find the truth of his existence in this cruel food-eating world.From the trailer, I figured this was going to be 90 minutes of profanity. And for the most part, that is accurate. The cursing is excessive, far beyond what should ever be in a movie. (I'm not opposed to profanity, but at a certain point it goes beyond the way any real person would talk.) What saves this film from just being curse words and mediocre animation is its social commentary. Maybe it does not say anything original, but it says the unoriginal in an original way. And, more importantly, it explains that beating your point of view over someone's head -- even if you're right -- is never the wise move.Great movie? Hardly. But there is something of a silver lining to this ridiculously juvenile film.",6,1,4,28 November 2016
There Will Be Blood," This Is What Oscar Looks Like
","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), a miner, strikes oil and quickly becomes a rich oilman. After finding out about a grand oil reservoir, Plainview cons an old man out of his land. But things aren't that easy... the man's son, an aspiring preacher, does everything in his power to get in Plainview's way. Oh, and Plainview's son goes deaf and becomes an introvert.This film is a dramatic, edgy tour-de-force. Possibly Paul Thomas Anderson's best film (though 'Magnolia' deserves some recognition) and an Oscar-winning performance from Daniel Day-Lewis (whose only better film, in my opinion, is 'Gangs of New York'). It just rocks.I couldn't stop watching 'There Will Be Blood' over and over again. I don't even know if I fully get it, as I was told there is a parallel between blood and oil in this movie, but I didn't really catch it. Sometimes I'm not as astute as others, but I was looking on purpose and still missed it. Oh, well.",8,2,4,8 September 2009
To Kill a Mockingbird," A 1960s Look At The 1930s
","Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer in the Depression-era South, defends a black man against an undeserved rape charge, and his kids against prejudice.What seems odd about this film is how it was made in the 1960s, looking at the 1930s. What would the same film have been like if it was made in the 1930s? Would the tone be different if not made during the civil rights movement? And, in some small way, did this film help push that movement forward? Now, this is not to say it is a bad film. It is a very good, and very timeless film. Bigotry is not dead, not by a long shot. And the belief that everyone deserves a strong defense should never go away, whether they are guilty or innocent, black or white, rich or poor.",7,0,2,24 November 2014
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Oh, War... Such a Silly Thing
","A group of British POWs is ordered by the Japanese to build a bridge over the River Kwai. While at first trying to stall, they eventually go along with the plan and take pride in their work. But what they don't know is that an American POW who was released from the camp has met up with British commandos who are determined to destroy the bridge.What we have here is the serious Nicholson (Alec Guinness) on one side against the slacker Shears (William Holden). While both working for the same side (the Allies) they are given two very opposed objectives. And only one of them can succeed... but who will it be? While not intentionally humorous, the film had something of a dark comedy aspect for me. Shears with his laid-back attitude, choosing to indulge woman and drink on the beach, and no love of authority, was a likable anti-hero. And the film as a whole had a message that screamed: war is pointless, banal and at times utterly mad. We the audience were watching collective, organized insanity.If you don't mind war dramas and films almost three hours in length, this one is a must-see. Nominated for almost every Oscar of any importance, and winning many of them... really, to go through life without seeing this would be unforgivable. I especially recommend it if you and your little sister are having a sleepover in a tent in the backyard.",8,1,5,22 February 2010
A Hard Day's Night," Beatlemania!
","A 'typical' day in the life of the Beatles, including many of their famous songs.What is this film? Well, basically an album with footage between songs. If you want something with a good plot and characters, this may not be it. But if you like Beatles music and want to see some innovative film techniques, this is your movie.Bosley Crowther noted the film was a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likable young lads who are constantly amazed at the attention they receive and who want nothing more than a little peace and quiet; however, they have to deal with screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them.The film is credited as being one of the most influential musical films of all time, inspiring numerous spy films, the Monkees' television show and pop music videos. Having grown up in a world where MTV style is prevalent, the edits here may not be obvious to the current generation. But the Beatles and Monkees connection is clear -- indeed, the Monkees seem to have based their show almost entirely off this film.",7,0,1,12 September 2014
Man on Fire," This Man is on Fire!!!
","I never saw the original, I'm not a Denzel Washington fan (even though his face is all over my pajamas). But this movie was incredibly awesome.The intensity of Denzel was undeniable as he went on his killing spree. I never expected the movie to get half as violent or gory as it did - this is the kind of thing I expect to see in 'se7en' or 'Saw'... wow! And complementing this perfectly was a soundtrack heavy with Nine Inch Nails remixes.Now, I dislike Dakota Fanning with a passion. She's over-used in movies, she's not cute. She needs to find a new dentist because her teeth look rotten out. And when she becomes a teenager, her career is over because she can only play cute little blonde, white girls.I did like the use of 'Mickey' in Spanish while the one guy was getting his just desserts. Very appropriate.I strongly look forward to the sequel and the prequel ('Man Standing Precariously Close to an Open Flame'). This film is highly recommended as the best action film of 2004 and one of the best of its genre in a long time.",8,0,3,13 September 2005
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Very Fine Film
","I'm going to make this very brief: you have a nut-house with Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Michael Berryman and Brad Dourif. Then, you transfer a violent prisoner (Jack Nicholson) into the asylum, who is sure to rouse the nuttiness of the patients there. That's really all you need to know.Of course, there's more to it than that. Nicholson's character takes it to a whole new level, doing things that are not only unpredictable but at times rather extreme. Not crazy extreme like cutting himself or flinging excrement, but just testing authority.What to watch for: when does testing authority go too far (and who is the bad guy when it does), and who is helping the patients more: the nurses on staff or the strong personality of the new patient?",8,0,1,5 May 2010
Downfall," Sympathetic Without Crossing The Line
","Traudl Junge, the final secretary for Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz), tells of the Nazi dictator's final days in his Berlin bunker at the end of WWII.The difficulty of any film focused on Germany during World War II is how to portray the humanity of the people without sympathizing with the Nazi cause. One does not want to make Hitler out to be human (although he was), but it is also unfair to paint an entire country as monsters.The Hollywood clichÃ© is that German soldiers were cruel and ruthless, but were they? Here we have Hitler's secretary, who saw much of the last days. If anyone can be said to be both inside the circle and yet innocent, it is her. If we are to believe the real Traudl Junge, such decisions as regarded concentration camps were never made known to her. She was a secretary, but apparently not typing up the most terrible documents.",8,2,3,2 December 2014
Whiplash," An Emotional Punch to the Gut
","A promising young drummer (Miles Teller) enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor (J. K. Simmons) who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential.This film will take people by surprise. Few viewers likely care about drumming or jazz music today. And they may think this film, therefore, will have no bearing on them. But it is so much more than that, an emotional punch to the gut that hits hard.Holding this together is the interaction of Miles Teller (who seems to be getting less credit than he deserves) and J. K. Simmons (who is getting the praise he ought to be). So intense, and quite the power struggle.Some have disliked the film for its message. But do they really know what its message is?",8,2,5,3 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," A Three-Hour Bacchanalia Caught on Film
","Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.As of now (February 2014), this film sits at an impressive #57 on IMDb's list of greatest films of all time. Using that as a jumping off point for this review, we will have to scale it back a bit. Whether the film should be on the list is debatable, but certainly not within the top 100 -- it is neither that good nor among director Martin Scorsese's best work.Along the same lines, the Oscar nomination for Best Picture is a bit much. While there is no denying it was probably among the ten best films of 2013, with some incredible acting and more than adequate cinematography and editing, the very fact it has no chance of winning makes one question why even nominate the film at all. (Of course, without nine nominees, we would be back to having the reasonable number of five...) Scorsese received a best director nomination, and this strikes me as more understandable. He managed to assemble an impressive cast and tell a story that is both compelling and entertaining, without trying to put some moral tag on it. Whether or not the viewer thinks this is a glorification or denouncement of the acts depicted is up to them, as the film itself is blank (in the best way).While on the subject, could the drug use and sexuality have been toned down? Absolutely. And there is a good argument that they should have been (especially the non-stop sex, which comes across as gratuitous and only adds more minutes to this lengthy financial epic). Another argument says the events are extremely unlikely and exaggerated at times. And this is probably also true; but the film is accurate to the memoir, not reality, and this is Belfort telling his story with all the embellishments that come with it. If you want just the facts, read the court transcripts.Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for best actor, and this is a choice that is understandable and yet hard to rally behind. He truly becomes Belfort, and probably makes the man out to be even more wild than he was. That deserves a nomination. But this is not DiCaprio's best role (he has also done a fine job portraying Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover) and not one he deserves the win for.Jonah Hill, on the other hand, was amazing and deserves to win his supporting actor category. Being up again Jared Leto, he probably has no chance, but Hill has come a long way in a few short years from a lovable doofus in 'Superbad' to a formidable actor in his own right. At first, 'Moneyball' seemed to be an anomaly in Hil's career, but he showed the world he could do even better when he became Donny Azoff in this picture. Incredible.Whether Terence Winter deserves Best Adapted Screenplay for this film is unclear without having read the book. Such a nomination seems fair, though the win is hard to say without more familiarity. I am surprised no nominations came for cinematography or editing, which are strong in their subtlety. But oh well.Of the film's five nominations, it may walk away with one win (Winter) or two at most (DiCaprio). More likely it will walk away empty-handed. The film is not flawless (we could go on about how awkward the soundtrack was) and may or may not go on to be memorable for much more than its nudity and pervasive cursing.",8,59,101,3 February 2014
Army of Darkness," The Third in the Evil Dead Story...
","After Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell), housewares, is transported back through time and space, he finds himself in a village that must fight the Evil Dead (the Deadites). To defeat them and create a portal back to the future, Ash must retrieve the Neconomicon and face great peril: miniature versions of himself, demons and other baddies.Usually a film of this caliber would not get such a high rating. The acting is cheesy, the plot rather weak and the costumes are poorly constructed (no one can possibly believe this is 1300). Even the dialog is unusual and the camera shots (a Raimi staple) are just not very solid. But somehow the film pulls it all off -- making the viewer believe that all this was done intentionally (and apparently Hollywood believed it, too, since they gave Raimi the Spider-Man franchise).We get more of the slapstick humor we found in 'Evil Dead II' and the Bruce Campbell many horror fans have grown to love. Only now he is trapped in medieval times. This is clearly the lesser of the three films (the horror element is lessened and the humor aspect raised, which I think hurts the overall feel). Yet, you'll find it hard to watch one without the other.Bill Moseley makes an appearance as the Evil Deadite Captain. You can't tell it's him, and I'm willing to bet many horror fans who love Moseley are not aware of his part in this film. It's an odd paradox: 'Army of Darkness' is probably a better loved film than 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre II', but Moseley is better known from the latter (and now 'Devil's Rejects'). Confront Bill about this if you ever run into him.Bridget Fonda also makes a very brief appearance. It's very strange... but maybe not so strange once you've seen her in 'Jackie Brown'. That Fonda clan is a strange bunch...But anyway, lacking a great plot or gore or nudity or even professional acting, this film shines and will remain a cult favorite long after I'm dead. As much as I'd love to tear it apart for the critical flaws, I just can't: my love for it is right up there with the love from the other fanboys.

The Last King of Scotland," Although Fictional, A Nice Telling of Amin
","Based on the events of the brutal Ugandan dictator Idi Amin's regime as seen by his personal physician during the 1970s.Although this film is fictional, it could very well have been true. The way Forest Whitaker portrays Idi Amin is incredible. Not that I knew the man, but I found this depiction of him to be pretty much exactly what you would expect an eccentric African dictator to be like.More importantly, strictly accurate or not, I am glad this story was brought to Western (and American) audiences. Far too few people know who Amin was, or know any African history, or even know where Uganda is. This, hopefully, sparked a minor interest in the topic.",7,1,3,11 November 2012
Scream 2," Great Sequel
","Two years after the first series of murders, a new psychopath dons the Ghostface costume and a new string of killings begins.This is one of those rare sequels that has just as strong a plot and writing as the original. Sure, in some ways it may not be as great (can you ever beat the first installment?) but its inclusion of 'sequel rules' and the introduction of the 'Stab' franchise? Quite clever.We also get a dramatic increase in star names, which is really saying something with the list of big names in the first. Some are not so great... you know, Jerry O'Connell has never had a good role. Ever. But on the flip side, Luke Wilson nails it in his cameo.",7,1,2,9 July 2015
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Beautiful, Romantic Interpretation of Bram Stoker
","Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) is an Englishman and a real estate agent who has procured some land for his client, Count Dracula of Romania (Gary Oldman). But the Count (who, as the audience knows, is really a bloodthirsty vampire) has his sights set not only on land but also Harker's fiancÃ©, Mina (Winona Ryder). Rounding out the cast is Anthony Hopkins as VanHelsing, Cary Elwes as a suitor to Mina's friend Lucy, and Tom Waits as the psychotic Renfield.This is an astoundingly amazing film. It's told in such an epic fashion, and I really wish they had made the movie longer. Hopkins as VanHelsing is as good or better than any Peter Cushing interpretation (this VanHelsing is darkly comic, which works great). More of the story could have been told or secondary characters may have been developed more. The Texan, for example, seems incredibly out of place and could have used some background... and Hopkins doesn't enter the movie until the second half.The deviation from the book is slight in some places and greater in others. For the most part, the diary entries were kept to move the plot along, which pleases me greatly. But there also seems to be an unusual obsession with making this a romance, which is somewhat unnecessary. There are romantic elements in the book (and my high school English teacher always stressed the symbolism of penetration in 'Dracula'), but it goes to a new level in the film that seems designed to draw in a wider audience. Whether this is good or bad, I'm not entirely sure.The special effects deserve praise. Compared to today (2008), I found the effects here far more convincing. The shadows that have their own minds, the count's transformations (powered by Oldman, the best actor in Hollywood today) and more. Other films of the era (most notably 'Jurassic Park') also pushed the limits of effects for the time, but 'Dracula' shouldn't be under-rated in this department. Many today could take a lesson from this playbook.I made a bigger deal of the cast in my plot summary than usual, but this is with good reason: the casting of this film is highly peculiar, and even more peculiar is how successful the combination of actors comes across. Keanu Reeves is not known as a great leading man, still fresh from 'Bill and Ted', but he does a decent enough job here. Winona Ryder is also somewhat of a lightweight, but pulls it off. But, countering this, Hopkins is amazing (as already noted), Oldman is the most perfect character actor for villains... and who would have thought to consider Tom Waits as a madman? It seems so obvious once you think about it.I watched this film on a DVD I purchased from a chain store for five bucks. It was worth this much and more. I am not aware if a special edition exists, but with this film's great cast, awesome plots, awards won and wide appeal, a good edition should. There is very little that could make the actual film better, but a solid audio commentary, 20-year retrospective and any deleted scenes would really provide the consumer with a worthwhile package.",9,1,2,18 June 2008
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Milk Was a Bad Choice
","See the headline? If you watch this movie and don't find the line 'milk was a bad choice' to be humorous, you're coming from a totally difficult angle than I. That, and the 'burrito, you are tasty but oh-so-filling'... because these parts, I think, are key.Why do so many people give this film a 10? I would say it's a funny film I have seen a few times and would watch again, but not a 10. Many people consider it one of Will Ferrell's weaker films. I would agree it is not on par with 'Old School'. And it's certainly not a stand-out role for Christina Applegate, who frankly was better alongside Ben Affleck in 'Surviving Christmas'. And can she star in a movie without being the woman pursued and all-too-easily obtained by the main male character? But overall, this film is funny and lots of subplots make it worth watching time and again. Sex Panther? Priceless. The street fight with Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson and Tim Robbins? Unbeatable. And Steve Carell is wonderful as Brick, the weatherman who is as thick as a... something.And it's my personal observation that no film goes wrong when the characters start singing the Starland Vocal Band's 'Afternoon Delight'. 'Good Will Hunting' proved that, didn't it? If you like Old School, Dodgeball, or any of those types of films (you know, Luke Wilson/Will Farrell/Vince Vaughn/Ben Stiller flicks)... you may as well watch this one, too.",6,0,1,12 June 2006
American Gangster," A Lesser-Known Gangster Story
","In 1970s America, a detective works to bring down the drug empire of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), a heroin kingpin from Manhattan, who is smuggling the drug into the country from the Far East.Although the 'Black Mafia' is not as well-known as its Italian counterpart, the names of Nicky Barnes and Bumpy Johnson have achieved widespread recognition. Frank Lucas, not so much. Though, if this film is close to reality, Lucas may have been even more successful than Barnes, Johnson or many of the Italian mobsters. (A scene even has an agent in disbelief that a black gangster could be so powerful, as he was too focused on the Italians to see other threats.) This film is tense, well-plotted and fascinating. Everyone loves a good crime film, and this is a very good crime film. Somehow, today (2015) it is not considered one of Ridley Scott's bigger films, but perhaps it should be. This easily rivals 'Gladiator', for example.",8,2,4,2 January 2015
The Mission," Liam Neeson
","18th century Spanish Jesuits try to protect a remote South American Indian tribe in danger of falling under the rule of pro-slavery Portugal.'The Mission' is based on events surrounding the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, in which Spain ceded part of Jesuit Paraguay to Portugal. A significant subtext is the impending Suppression of the Jesuits, of which Father Gabriel is warned by the film's narrator, Cardinal Altamirano, who was once himself a Jesuit.What struck me about this film is that I watched it immediately after 'Cannibal Ferox', another tale about Europeans / Americans going into the Amazon where the natives speak a little Portuguese. Both can be seen as anti-colonial films, though one is a period piece and the other is modern day (1981). What other messages do they share?",7,1,4,2 February 2016
Stranger Than Fiction," A Beautiful, Existential Film... A Breath of Fresh Air
","Harold Crick lives his life the same day after day until he begins to the hear the voice of the narrator, telling him everything he's doing and is about to do. This is when he becomes aware of his impending doom, and seeks out the narrator, hoping she will not tell the end of her story.Will Ferrell (playing Harold Crick) takes a nice change of acting here. While this is still a 'comedy' in a general sense, it's not the kind where you laugh a lot or expect stupid behavior. It's a more mature, refined comedy. And I think Ferrell really proved something to us all when he took this turn.Dustin Hoffman provides the best character in the film (which is even better because it's played by Dustin Hoffman). A literature professor who tries to find Harold's author based on his life events and the use of the phrase 'little did he know'. This is where the existential aspect really comes in -- life as literature, a deep philosophic tradition (I won't get into it here).Maggie Gyllenhaal: Great actress, beautiful... and love the anarchist baker character (at a bakery called The Uprising). Wonderful.Is the narrator/author Nicholas Sparks? She's known for killing off all her main characters. It would be like as if in the middle of 'A Walk to Remember' that Mandy Moore realized that Sparks was writing her. 'Oh crap,' she's say. 'Any hope of surviving this film has just been completely shot.' This will be the first time I ever wrote a 'spoiler' but I have to, because the only part of this movie really worth discussing is the very end. Harold is supposed to die, he is written to die, and we see him dying. To me (and most people I talked to) this was the perfect ending -- end it here and fade to black. But instead they make him survive the impossible and the ending is changed. Which was horrible.The only part that makes this new ending redeeming is Dustin Hoffman, who has seen both endings and informs the narrator that the original ending was vastly superior. The fact the movie actually admits it would be better to do what they chose not to gives them some credit... though I still wish he had died.",8,0,0,25 March 2007
The Green Mile," Darabont Scores Again
","The lives of guards on Death Row are affected by one of their charges: a black man (Michael Clarke Duncan) accused of child murder and rape, yet who has a mysterious gift.Starting off early with 'Top Hat', not unlike its use in 'Purple Rose of Cairo', one wonders if this old film has grown in popularity since its earlier days... but this is neither here nor there.The writing of Stephen King is largely dismissed by critics, and the movies made of his books are very hit and miss. The same with Frank Darabont, whose work is overall nothing terribly special. Yet, somehow when they come together, they do amazing things, at least with prison films. Both this and 'Shawshank Redemption' have sat firmly on IMDb's Top 250, usually very high on the list.And this one should be. Maybe not high art like the French new wave films or the works of Chaplin, Kubrick and others, but this is a movie that will be timeless. One hundred years from now, it will still be remembered and enjoyed by fans. And that means something.",8,1,2,17 November 2014
The Reader," Right and Wrong
","Post-WWII Germany: Nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, law student Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) re-encounters his former lover (Kate Winslet) as she defends herself in a war-crime trial.The film raises the question of whether we should judge someone by the law or rather 'the laws of the time'. And there is a big difference. Of course we know that killing is morally wrong, and those who sent people to death in World War II were morally in the wrong, even if they were only following orders.But were they legally wrong? One could argue not. That is a difficult topic. Like the women of this film, those at the Nuremberg Trial were tried and convicted under laws invented after the war. Laws written by the winners. This makes one wonder: is it right to put someone on trial for something morally wrong, even if it was not legally wrong? And who should decide the laws? Had the Axis won, they could have just as easily declared it illegal to drop atomic bombs on innocent villages and then try, convict and execute Harry Truman.Right and wrong is no easy topic.",7,1,1,7 July 2015
Jaws," There Is Only One Shark Movie: Jaws -- Spielberg
","In Amity, New York, there is a new police chief in town: Chief Brody. And he has one mission: protect the people of Amity. So when a great white shark invades the beaches of his city, he is left with no choice but to take desperate measures: the shark must be captured and destroyed at all costs. Let the adventure begin.What can you say that hasn't already been said about a film that is not only one of the top horror films of all time, but also one of the top films of any genre (even in the top 100)? There really isn't very much, but I just have to sing my praises for this film anyway.'Jaws' comes to us from director Steven Spielberg, whom I've had my issues with. I've often found him to be a weak director, not a risk taker and obsessed with little boys. His films can be categorized into two columns: those about aliens, and those about Jews. 'E.T.', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'Jurassic Park' are alien movies. So is 'Jaws' -- an alien creature invades a peaceful small town. A town where the chief has two young boys (although this is played down).I actually watched 'Jaws' for the first time rather late in life, but was already a fan before I ever saw it. I am and have been a huge fan of Kevin Smith since 1995 when I saw 'Mallrats' opening day. Smith has used 'Jaws' references in almost all his films, putting the injury discussion scene into 'Chasing Amy' and naming many of his characters after Jaws characters. 'Mallrats' gave us Brody, Bruce, Quint... and later we'd have Hooper. (Bruce is the name of the shark.) And we have a young Richard Dreyfuss. How does that not make a movie by itself? Robert Shaw is great and Roy Scheider was fine, but Dreyfuss really steals the show. And a score from the legendary John Williams? Never a bad idea. Especially now in hindsight, thirty-two years later. Even if you haven't seen 'Jaws', you know the theme song.Oh, that Richard Dreyfuss. The scene where he is slamming coffee to compete with Shaw's beer, and crushes the cup... awesome. Best cup/can crushing scene ever, even more so than 'Lone Wolf McQuade'. And who can deny this film is very quotable ('head, tail, the whole damn thing' and 'you're gonna need a bigger boat' come to mind). That makes a film iconic, when quotes from it show up in popular culture.How do you end a review about the greatest shark movie ever? A movie that vastly eclipses 'Shark Attack 3: Megalodon' and 'Hammerhead'? You simply can't do it enough justice. This film is everything a movie should be, and it has a shark. What more do you want?",10,2,6,20 May 2007
The Wrestler," Rourke's Finest Role
","A faded professional wrestler (Mickey Rourke) must retire, but finds his quest for a new life outside the ring a dispiriting struggle.Alonso Duralde, of MSNBC, said, 'Rourke's work transcends mere stunt-casting; his performance is a howl of pain that seems to come from a very real place.' Todd McCarthy, of Variety, said, 'Rourke creates a galvanizing, humorous, deeply moving portrait that instantly takes its place among the great, iconic screen performances.' And that about sums it up. While Darren Aronofsky deserves much credit (he has yet to make a bad movie), this was Rourke's film from beginning to end. If the rumors are true that the studio wanted Nicolas Cage to play the lead, I am really glad that never happened. I love Cage, he has a lot of good acting in him when he chooses to use it... but Rourke owned this role.",8,0,0,27 May 2013
Kingpin," Decent Gross-Out Comedy
","A star bowler whose career was prematurely 'cut off' hopes to ride a new prodigy to success and riches.The two big comedies from this team are 'Kingpin' and 'There's Something About Mary'. Both have some gross-out humor, and this one definitely is not afraid of poop, vomit and bull fluids. I could probably do without all that. And this is probably the lesser of the two. It succeeds in making Lin Shaye, a wonderful person, into a horrifying monster.Funny? Yes. And definitely a different sort of role for Randy Quaid. Bill Murray shines (as always). I always feel a little bit weird when Amish folks show up in films because they seem to be the butt of jokes, and they are probably not even aware that people make fun of them.",6,0,3,13 November 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Computer Graphics Kill This Film
","As the Clone Wars near an end, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious steps out of the shadows, at which time Anakin succumbs to his emotions, becoming Darth Vader and putting his relationships with Obi-Wan and Padme at risk.This film has far too much reliance on special effects and CG. Even the fire is obviously computer-rendered. Most of the action scenes are completely fake and even one of the main bad guys (Grievous) is clearly a cartoon. How can I take this seriously, especially when they were able to create better-looking aliens back in the 1970s? To be fair, though, this is the best of the second (or first?) trilogy, because it finally catches us up. We knew what had to happen because these were prequels, and the arc is effectively handled.",6,2,6,17 June 2015
Ray," The Piano Legend
","The story of the life and career of the legendary rhythm and blues musician Ray Charles, from his humble beginnings in the South, where he went blind at age seven, to his meteoric rise to stardom during the 1950s and 1960s.Early on, we run into Quincy Jones, who I would not have guessed had any connection to Ray Charles. Of course, not really knowing much about either of them, that is not surprising.I love the conflict of Gospel music and a more upbeat sound, that somehow changing the music to the words makes it 'devil music'. How realistic this was as a criticism is not known to me. It seems silly, but then again, the 1950s were a silly time.And who knew Charles was a junkie? Maybe not as bad as some, but it is crazy to think that heroin was just as much a part of the music scene then as it was in other times (such as 1990s Seattle). I had assumed it was more obscure, with folks like William S. Burroughs being the primary users.",7,1,2,17 June 2015
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," An Achievement
","The fair Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but the handsome prince has other ideas.Looking back now (2015), after 75 years, you could be a bit critical of the film. Maybe the songs are not the best, or the animation is less than perfect. Certainly the voices (particularly Snow White herself) are not the voices you wan to hear necessarily. But put it all in context.This was, for all practical purposes, the first full-length animated feature. One can argue about earlier films (and rightly so), but this is the one that took the world by storm, sold millions of tickets and became part of American culture. Heck, they even used a clip in 'Gremlins'.",8,1,2,20 February 2015
The Lion King," One of the Great Disney Films of the Early 1990s
","Tricked into thinking that he caused the death of his own father (James Earl Jones), a young lion cub (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) flees and abandons his destiny as the future king.Disney's strongest period in recent history was the late 1980s and early 1990s. They consistently released hits: 'Little Mermaid', 'Aladdin', 'Beauty and the Beast'. The princesses from these films have taken their place alongside the classics (Snow White and Cinderella). Until 'Frozen' twenty years later, this success would not be repeated.'The Lion King' came at the end of this cycle, and did not feature a princess (at least not in human form). But it is still a great tale of loss, redemption, triumph. Many would place it among the top three Disney cartoons ever made.",7,1,2,20 November 2014
Inception," Christopher Nolan is the Modern Directing Genius
","As I type this, 'Inception' is sitting at #6 on IMDb's Top 250 and has a firm 9 out of 10 voting average. That is unheard of. Not to say it is not a great film, but I am a little shocked by this. I give it an 8...Long story short, Christopher Nolan is a genius. He has a ton of films on the top 250 list, and still has along career ahead of him. This film was both written and directed by him, and the story and visuals are striking. Some of the story I think is a bit iffy (if you are too critical it might have major holes) but if you are accepting its basic premise, it is a solid concept that has not been explored before.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb, and Leo is always a good lead. The family issues here tread close to where 'Shutter Island' tread, but this only shows where that other film fell short (as much as I enjoyed both).Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur, and was for me the most pleasant surprise of the film. I still have a hard time accepting him as a legitimate actor and not just a cheesy, comedic character. But here I was moved. He did his own stunts during what was by far my favorite scene of the film, and although he still looks twenty (he was 29 at the time this film came out) he has lots of potential.Ellen Page was a decent Ariadne (her most adult role yet), and it was nice to see Nolan veterans Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine back for more. And a special shout-out to Pete Postlethwaite (Maurice Fischer) in what was one of his very final roles.Anyway, a must-see if ever there was one in the last few years. 9 out of 10? Maybe. 6th greatest film ever? I don't know... but definitely one of those rare gems of the last decade.",8,0,16,7 January 2011
Lord of War," This Movie Owns
","'There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is: How do we arm the other 11?' Also, why did Nicolas Cage's movies disappear so quickly from theaters this year (the other one being 'Weather Man')? This is one of the best films of 2005, definitely in the top 3. It's a great action, a great drama, a great political statement. But most of all it's a great romance. Lord of War tells of a man who rises from the low ranks of gun-running to become a world class arms dealer, not unlike Scarface or Goodfellas. Along the way, he tricks his childhood crush into becoming his wife and is hunted by rogue agent Ethan Hawke. When the you-know-what hits the fan, will Cage choose his family and wife over his love of money? And either way, will it be too late with Hawke closing in? Based on true events in the world of gun running, and especially interesting the way Liberia and Sierra Leone are portrayed. What looked like a dark comedy from the previews turns out to be the social commentary of the year (although maybe tied with Syriana). Highest possible recommendation.",9,2,6,17 December 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Not Flawless, But One of the More Under-Rated Films of the Year
","Sherlock Holmes and his faithful assistant Watson are on the case of a man who has seemingly risen from the dead to terrorize London. While the police seem clueless, Holmes is on top of things, and while his methods are unorthodox, they just might work.Robert Downey Jr. is great in anything he does, but he makes a particularly fine Sherlock Holmes -- the English equivalent of Tony Stark. Jude Law is a respectable Dr. John Watson, and fleshes out what could have been a forgettable character. Rachel McAdams plays Irene Adler, the love interest. I have a personal dislike for McAdams and view her as the weak part of the film, but that's likely just my own bias.The cinematography in the film was great, but almost too polished at times, clearly computerized. This is a new venture for Guy Ritchie, who also has ventured away from the 'R' rating for the first time. He does, though, push the boundaries a bit. Ritchie was also said to remove Holmes' hat, and the line 'elementary', which was clearly a good move... Ritchie has proved himself capable of much more than gangster flicks.Some people have claimed the film has homoerotic undertones, while others have denied any such thing. I saw it immediately. You may write it off as 'friendship', but there are plenty of lines that blurred the picture and the entire dinner scene with Mary was very tense in a jealous lover sort of sense.Hans Zimmer was robbed. If this film has no other Oscar-worthy things going for it (and that may well be true), Zimmer's score blew me away and really drove the film. I don't mean to say that the winner's score was bad, but if anyone thinks that Zimmer didn't take this music and thrust it into a whole new level of powerful soundscaping, you are deaf.What this film probably does best is sets up for a sequel that could outdo the first... recall how 'Batman Begins' left an opening for 'The Dark Knight'? A similar act is followed here. And while no sequel has been officially announced to my knowledge, I have to say that it's one of the most anticipated upcoming films for me... by and large because of the build-up created here.",8,1,2,3 April 2010
WALLÂ·E," The Silent, Ecological Pixar Film
","In the distant future, a small waste collecting robot inadvertently embarks on a space journey that will ultimately decide the fate of mankind.What makes this film so great is how for most of the film (at least the first half), most of the story is told silently. Or, that is, at least without dialogue. To do that and still hold an audience's attention is a good feat. The artwork is also amazing, quite possibly the best Pixar film up to this point (2014).The ecology theme is nice, but more than a little blunt. A ship full of fat earthlings who are so lazy they do not even know they have a pool? Now, it is one thing to say the future has the planet covered in trash ('Idiocracy' made a similar claim), but this is just too blunt...",8,1,2,11 December 2014
Finding Dory," Good, But Far From Pixar's Best
","The friendly but forgetful blue tang fish begins a search for her long-lost parents, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way.I suspect what you get out of 'Finding Dory' depends on what you put into it. I went in knowing nothing and still came away disappointed. While the movie has plenty of funny parts, and the animation is amazing, it doesn't seem all that memorable or like they really covered new ground from the first film.And it is not just because it is a sequel. Some would argue that 'Toy Story 3' was the best in that series. I doubt anyone could argue that 'Dory' was anywhere near as good as 'Nemo'. If it weren't for some interesting new supporting character, it would have been quite a rehash. Dory, the protagonist, is not really all that interesting.",7,6,14,26 November 2016
Stalag 17," Billy Wilder Just Keeps Pumping Out the Hits
","Prisoners Manfredi and Johnson try to escape through a tunnel the inmates have dug under the barbed wire. They are immediately shot by waiting prison guards when they emerge outside the fence. The other prisoners conclude that one of their own must have informed the Germans of the escape attempt, and suspicion falls on Sefton (William Holden), a cynical and somewhat antisocial prisoner who barters openly with the German guards for eggs, silk stockings, blankets and other luxuries.'Look at all that meat -- ain't she the bitter end?' Robert Strauss, who plays Animal, is the real heart of this film. Sure, William Holden is great, but Strauss is the comic relief and a lovable guy. Without his antics, the film wouldn't have been the success that it was and is.The antics are great. There's gambling with cigarettes, using mice as horses to simulate horse races, including one named Seabiscuit who loses to Snickelfritz. There's the repeated attempts to get to the other side of the camp in order to see the Russian women.The gist of the film reminded me of the television show 'Hogan's Heroes', and apparently I'm not alone. Allegedly the creators of 'Heroes' got sued and had to pay a large out-of-court settlement for ripping off the general premise.And that's all I want to say about that. Director Billy Wilder, with William Holden and some funny Nazi guards (but not really funny, that would be wrong). It's a grand film, with everything going for it. So, quite simply, I have to say this is one you must see.",8,2,4,11 March 2010
Arrival," Great Film, But Too Much Drama For My Taste
","When twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is tasked with interpreting the language of the apparent alien visitors.Everything about this film is great: the look, the science, the acting, the sound. I especially loved how much linguistics played a role in the story, and how it was explained the various parts of language in thought, as well as the advantages of a written versus spoken communication.I also thought the idea of the non-linear use of time was very clever, and fairly well-executed. I actually figured out the twist about halfway through, but that didn't make it any less interesting or intriguing. Certain aspects call to mind causality, and put them into question: could the Chinese general say and do things in the future that would assist in the past? Under a strict timeline, no. But yet, for the film, it works.Which then raises the question: if the timeline is not linear, not causal, how can Louise access the future at all? Would their not be an infinite number of possible futures? By knowing of her daughter's illness, does not that very awareness open the door for her to choose not to have children and avoid all her visions becoming reality? Or is she doomed to 'choose' a path that is the only one fate allows her to take? So why do I only give the film a 7 rather than the higher number most people feel it deserves? Simply put, I found the drama a bit heavy-handed. As a science fiction film, it is great, but really diminished by the emotional aspects attached. And while those may be important to certain points the film is trying to make, it still seems like too much focus is put on them. This really brought me out of my enjoyment.",7,3,11,21 February 2017
The Terminal," Terminally Ill: Put This Film Out of Its Misery
","This film was a roller coaster ride for me. Initially, I was told be practically everyone this film stunk. One person said it was 'artistic' (and I now disagree). The film started off slow and tedious, focusing on the main character's language barrier. By halfway, I admit I was in love with this film. I was eager to see what would happen next -- the ways the character gets food and money are very interesting. But the honeymoon was short and by the end, I wished this film a spot in eternal damnation.The story, if you don't know, is of a man who uses his citizenship in midair because his country plunges into civil war. Not being able to go home, and not able to enter America on a now-bogus passport, he ends up trapped and living in the JFK Airport.The film stars Tom Hanks (who is given way more credit than he deserves) and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Also, there is an Oompah Loompah that juggles and spins plates. Sadly, this guy is the most interesting character in the film.My minor beef is the 'product placement' that runs rampant in this film. Burger King, Borders, and a dozen other stores must have poured millions of dollars into this movie. My major beef is the 'far-fetched' complaint. At first, it starts out believable. But soon, the airport security chief becomes a monster and a caricature of evil. Hanks builds things -- walls and fountains -- in the airport without security caring, and rips chairs out of the ground. He befriends people and exchanges favors, falls in love with a gorgeous flight attendant (who annoyingly brings up obscure Napoleon facts for no reason at all the wrong times) and in some scenes has what looks like a thousand employees working as his entourage. I don't happen to believe this.A point for Steven Spielberg. While he usually pumps out mediocre crap, this film is different. It's still mediocre crap. But it's mediocre crap that doesn't rely on aliens, Jews or little boys to sell the story. Thanks Steven, I appreciate the fact Tom Hanks didn't have to fight off aliens in the terminal to save a Jewish boy. (Although in fairness all directors have their themes.) Is this film recommended? Of course not. If you like Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, that's your first mistake. Don't make renting this movie your second mistake.",3,4,7,5 March 2006
The Blind Side," It's Okay
","The story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman (Sandy Bullock) and her family.The highlight of this film is the scene with S.J. serving as Michael's manager. That is pretty humorous, even if it is probably not close to accurate. (Heck, most of the movie is probably not accurate.) I watched this to check it off as a 2010 Oscar winner. Did Bullock deserve the award? Maybe, but all she really does is talk with a bad accent. We also get an interesting story about race, racism, and stark class differences. The message is not blunt, but maybe that is clever in a way... viewers can take away the message they want to take.",6,2,2,14 July 2015
The Shawshank Redemption," IMDb and the Greatest Film of All Time
","Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.",10,4,6,6 November 2014
Rango," Grossly Overrated Film
","Rango (Johnny Depp) is an ordinary chameleon who accidentally winds up in the town of Dirt, a lawless outpost in the Wild West in desperate need of a new sheriff.How this film won the Oscar for best animated film of 2011 is beyond me. All I can think is that there just were not very strong contenders for the prize (I know I cannot think of any). I will say the animation itself is amazing -- it is quite possibly the best animation I have ever seen. So, George Lucas, you have outdone Pixar and you should be proud.And I will also say I enjoyed the references to 'True Grit', Clint Eastwood and Lee VanCleef. Oh ,and Hunter Thompson. I think those were an excellent touch. I wish that Eastwood himself could have lent his distinctive voice.But the film does seem to just feel very flat for me. While the plot is alright, I could not get myself to care about the characters. Who lived or died was of little consequence to me... even Rango himself was not much of a hero.Roger Ebert says the film is 'wonderfully made, great to look at, wickedly satirical' and he gives it four stars! The review is a big, slobbery kiss with repeated calls to see it and bring your family. I guess whatever Ebert was drinking must not be in my refrigerator.",6,1,4,21 April 2012
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Great Film, But Still Over-hyped and Overrated
","A washed-up actor who once played an iconic superhero (Michael Keaton) must overcome his ego and family trouble as he mounts a Broadway play in a bid to reclaim his past glory.All the hype said this was an Oscar contender for Best Picture, as well as for Best Actor. As of now, the film has walked away with two Golden Globes: Best Screenplay and Best Actor. The former seems fair enough, but the latter is misguided. Keaton, while good, never seems to go outside his comfortable range, while Bill Murray in 'St. Vincent' blew Keaton out of the water.This is still a great film from a technical standpoint, with credit going to the editors and the cinematographer. And the acting is certainly not bad (though Emma Stone seemed out of play). But the praise Keaton is receiving seems out of place, and exaggerated.",7,3,15,12 January 2015
The Big Short," The Big Short Falls a Bit Short
","Four denizens in the world of high-finance predict the credit and housing bubble collapse of the late-2000s, and decide to take on the big banks for their greed and lack of foresight.As the Oscar ceremony approaches (slowly but surely), the front-runner for best picture is said to be 'Spotlight', with 'The Big Short' named as a possible usurper. But right up front, let it be made clear: that possibility is slim. Although this is certainly an important film, it is not necessarily a great film.The film is nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, and on that front, it has a real chance. The writers took what should be a dry, boring subject and made it somewhat interesting by adding humor and some unexpected cameos. A serious attempt was made to explain Wall Street in terms that everyone can understand. But one of the reasons it will not win Best Picture is because it never quite succeeds in explaining certain things. Comparing CDOs to soup makes sense, and using blackjack to explain why 'hot hand' statistics and odds are false is wonderful. But even the very core concept of the film -- betting against something -- is never as clear as it should be. (And it does not help that Margot Robbie mumbles through her lines.) The script, which again is very good, should perhaps have been streamlined before filming. Most of the time we are in a sort of fast-paced world, a place Rosalind Russell of 'His Girl Friday' would have appreciated. But we get bogged down with subplots that do not matter. The montages showing time passing added nothing, and the whole bit about Steve Carell's character dealing with a suicide did not matter. Yes, they flesh out his character, but in a story with so many protagonists, it makes no difference.Speaking of Carell, some say he got snubbed for an acting nomination. That is a fair complaint. In recent years, he has shown himself to be much more than the guy from 'The Office' or 'Evan Almighty'. He stood out in 'Foxcatcher' (for which he was nominated), and he goes above and beyond that here. Playing Mark Baum may be his best role to date.The Academy did decide to nominate Christian Bale. There is no argument that Bale is not one of the finest actors in the business, from 'The Machinist' and 'American Psycho' up through his recent work. He successfully portrays a man with Asperger's (without going over the top) and a glass eye. It is a great role. Will he win? Probably not, but only because Supporting Actor is shaping up to be one of the toughest categories this year. Both Mark Ruffalo and Mark Rylance are strong, so it seems likely one Mark or the other is getting the award.Again, Best Picture seems woefully out of reach, which leaves the other big category: Best Director. This is a huge feather in the cap of Adam McKay, because he is not typically associated with Oscar-worthy film. This is the guy who brought us the Funny or Die website, as well as 'Anchorman' and 'Step Brothers'. He makes great movies, but movies of an altogether different type. Up against heavyweights like Inarritu and Tom McCarthy, this win seems far-fetched.Judging based on the Golden Globes (which is no sure indicator), 'The Big Short' is the sort of film that gets several nominations, but few wins. At the Globes, it took home zero. With the Oscars, it might have a shot at Adapted Screenplay (as noted above), but will likely go home empty-handed. By no means is this a bad movie (it clearly is among 2015's best), but unfortunately for those involved, it will be edged out by different movies in each category and may be the film with the most unfulfilled nominations.",7,2,5,31 January 2016
Platoon," Platoon, You Are A Dream Come True
","Anything nice you say about this film is like a whisper on a scream. It's a classic, it won awards, it has an unbelievably great cast. So it's not like I really need to say anything more. But I will.I wasn't sure Charlie Sheen had the depth to carry on a role of this magnitude, but he did. His character was exactly like Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones. Except that they have nothing in common. Well, that one thing. They both hate snakes. Tom Berenger was ruthless. Willem Dafoe did the best damn job I've ever seen him do in a film and I found him very likable, which is odd considering how much I intensely hate Dafoe on a personal level (even more than Saddam Hussein hates Kurds). Dafoe shines like a diamond in a field of A-holes.Kevin Dillon was so despicable that I found myself actually feeling the pain of the Vietnamese people. In my soul. I wanted to channel the spirit of Ho Chi Minh to avenge the deaths of his people. I cried twice. It was very sad to see families torn apart and people treated like dogs or maybe even something worse. Johnny Depp will go down in history for his role in this film - it is by far his best role and he should have received a supporting actor Oscar.But more than Depp, Dafoe or even Sheen - the scene-stealer was John McGinley. As Super-Lifer O'Neill he filmed the movie with anguish, anger, humor, sadness, hopeless bleak despair, and sheer acting constipation. His Weird Al Yankovic-looking face made me smile while at the same time I was emotionally destroyed on the inside. McGinley, this Bud's for you. This film is awesome - very recommended!",8,1,3,11 September 2005
Scream," Wes Craven's Phenomenal Comeback
","A group of teens are pitted against a masked murderer that tests their knowledge of horror movies.Can we admit that Neve Campbell is a terrible actress? She managed to get in all four 'Scream' films, and 'The Craft', and 'Wild Things' and 'Party of Five'. She was a dominant force of the 1990s. But really, just admit it, she was the Kristen Stewart of the 1990s -- very wooden, not much range, and considered more appealing by studio executives than by actual viewers.But that criticism aside, this is a great film, and definitely among Wes Craven's best. He has had his great films and his less-than-great films. Some, frankly, we might want to forget. But this was so powerful, really added some wit to the slasher film, and for that we must respect the man. Wes Craven is the all-time greatest horror director.",8,2,4,21 May 2015
Halloween," An Undeniable Classic
","Fifteen years after killing his older sister, Michael Myers escapes from the asylum to wreak havoc on the town of Haddonfield, Illinois. At the same time, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) uses her time to babysit two youngsters and Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) begins to hunt the madman. When the three collide, the you-know-what hits the fan.What do you say about a film that has been analyzed for over 25 years, praised by almost everyone and copied by some of the biggest people in the horror industry (although it is hard to be bigger than John Carpenter, really). Everything has been said, but I will try to say it again in my own words.This movie does everything right for the budget it was given and the time period it was filmed in. Mixing innovative new ideas with several homages to Alfred Hitchcock (not least of which is casting Jamie Lee Curtis, the daughter of 'Psycho''s Janet Leigh). We have scenes that are much too dark to see what is going on, but set a very good mood. We have first-person perspective from the killer or from over the shoulder of the killer (an often imitated technique). But best of all, I liked how the film constantly built suspense without ever letting the viewer relax (you never knew when the killer would strike).A criticism could be that there is absolutely no gore in this film at all... maybe only a spoonful of blood. But somehow Carpenter does what others have failed to do and made the deaths such an inconsequential part of the killer genre. Unlike Freddy or Jason, who hack their victims in half, Michael can kill off-screen and still be menacing.I was a bit curious how scary a killer could be when he stalks his prey in a station wagon, because nothing says terror less than the soccer mom vehicle of choice. But it worked. Carpenter employed many distant angles, as if we were watching the prey from a distance, tracking them, closing in for a kill.I could complain that the women of this film were not attractive at all (especially the hermaphrodite Jamie Lee Curtis), but somehow it did not seem to matter. PJ Soles, who played Lynda, totally kept my interest as a victim. And I mean totally. The other girl, Annie, I could have done without. Writer and producer Debra Hill was allegedly 'unusually thin-skinned and defensive about the film's sexual side.'As much as I would like to give the best actor award to Nick Castle (who played Michael Myers and later became the director of the crappy 'Major Payne' movie), no one would deny it to Donald Pleasance. Already a veteran actor, Pleasance is now pretty much known best as his role as Dr. Sam Loomis.After seeing the film a handful of times, I still notice new things. I think that is a testament to some of the subtleties of the film. That, or the theater version has scenes that were not on the home video, because I watched it on the big screen and heard lines I never recall hearing before...If you enjoy modern horror films, give this one a shot and see why it remains 'the most profitable independent film ever made.' Before Freddy and Jason, there was Michael Myers... and not the crappy Michael Myers from 'Halloween: H20' or 'Halloween: Resurrection', but a real ruthless killer from the 1970s. (Also, 'Halloween 2' is alright, just do not bother wasting your time on the third part unless you want your brain scrambled.)",9,3,10,26 November 2006
Paths of Glory," A Solid Film, Though In My Opinion Not Kubrick's Best
","General George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) of the French General Staff asks his subordinate, General Mireau (George Macready), to send his division on a suicidal mission to take a well-defended German position called the 'Anthill'. Mireau initially advises against the attack, citing the low probability of success and the danger to his beloved soldiers, but when General Broulard mentions the possibility of a promotion, Mireau quickly convinces himself the attack will succeed.In a sense, this film anticipates 'Hamburger Hill', with the military's focus on one impossible task. Though, I don't think this film is historically accurate, and they don't really seem too concerned when they don't make it.The theme seems to be glory over pragmatism, over perhaps glory versus pragmatism. To achieve glory, the soldiers have to accept a mission that will surely lead to their death. From the point of view of the officers (who command but don't fight), glory is an easy choice. But pragmatism, choosing the best option at the moment, is seen as cowardice, despite saving the lives of the men and having them alive to fight another day. In war, who wins this struggle? Kirk Douglas is excellent as Dax, excellent during the trial scene, which I saw as the pivotal part. Along with Douglas, I have to single out Timothy Carey, who made the scene great, and was also excellent in 'The Killing'. (Carey went on to be one of Hollywood's great character actors, and the man behind 'The World's Greatest Sinner'.) Last but not least, this film showcases Kubrick's hot wife... it's no surprise that he was attracted to her, and they had many years of marriage... presumably happy.",7,0,3,13 March 2010
Despicable Me," One of The, If Not The, Best Movies of 2010
","I am not really big on cartoon movies, but my girlfriend is. So I ended up watching this with her and her family. Boy, I am sure glad I was included in that event: this film was a true gem.Not only is it funny, but it is fun, and even emotional at times. I possibly cried twice, and I am not prone to crying. But that is just how it goes when you have a film like this -- something with both cute little minions and girls who you have to feel a bit sorry for (although the eldest girl is a bit of a brat).Gru makes a great villain, and I look forward to seeing him again in the sequel. (2016 update: The sequel is just as good. The third film, 'Minions', has its weak spots, but I still anticipate part four.)",8,0,1,23 December 2010
Back to the Future Part II," Weakest of the Three?
","My girlfriend says this is the weakest of the three, and I am inclined to agree. For one thing, they got rid of Crispin Glover, which is a terrible mistake. They also brought in Elisabeth Shue, which is an improvement, but ruins continuity. Beyond that, the story gets a bit garbled.Trying to make a time travel movie without messing with paradox or nonsense is hard. Granted, this film does it better than many time films... but some of it is just silly. The big problem revolves around a sports almanac. The almanac would not be brought to the past if Marty had not been brought to the future. He did not even need to be brought at all, though. Rather than just tell Marty, 'Hey, your son is going to make a mistake on this day -- don't let him' they travel to the future... but this allows Marty a glimpse of things to come for no good reason.By the way, this opens up the possibility of Marty still betting on the World Series in 2015... getting rich.",7,1,4,23 December 2010
Carrie," The First (And Possibly Best) King Movie
","A young, abused and timid 17-year-old girl (Sissy Spacek) discovers she has telekinesis, and gets pushed to the limit on the night of her school's prom by a humiliating prank.There seems to be little reason to review this film. Everyone knows it is a horror classic, and even has an entire book devoted to its analysis. Brian DePalma is one of the all-time great directors and he shows that here (using some of his trademark skills, like the split screen shots). Some may say he is nothing more than a cheap imitator of Hitchcock and others, but that is unfair. (Yes, there are a handful of 'Psycho' references here, but that is to be expected given the material).Spacek is successfully awkward, William Katt's hair is amazing, and it is great to see P. J. Soles pre-Halloween. Amy Irving is great, and met her husband (Steven Spielberg) on the set, which is a story in itself. Nancy Allen always shines, and it is great to see her alongside John Travolta years before they reunited with DePalma's 'Blow Out' (1981).",8,4,5,27 October 2014
The Queen," Another Look at the Diana Tragedy
","After the death of Princess Diana, HM Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) struggles with her reaction to a sequence of events nobody could have predicted.I was not one of those who was devastated by the death of Princess Diana. So stories of her life are not terribly appealing to me. This one was different, though, and told the tale from a completely different perspective -- a queen who did not particularly care for her daughter-in-law.How accurate this, I have no idea. How much of the behind-the-scenes moments happened, who knows? How interesting to look at the royal family in this way, especially when all the key players were still alive.",6,2,3,14 July 2015
Blow," The Greatest and Best Johnny Depp Picture?
","George Jung (Johnny Depp) grew up in a struggling middle class home, and wanted better for himself. After being introduced to the marijuana trade by his friend Tuna (Ethan Suplee), he goes on to learn cocaine dealing and becomes a very big man... the American end of Pablo Escobar.This could be Johnny Depp's finest hour. He is not charismatic, he isn't flamboyant, he just acts a role... and blends in perfectly. I found him absolutely believable, which is tricky when you're as big a man as Depp. You tend to see Depp as Depp and not his character, but here he fit in fine.Director Ted Demme put this together very smoothly, but strangely enough died of a cocaine overdose, or at least with cocaine in his system, after the film was finished. One might think this film would scare people away from cocaine, but maybe it only scares dealers...Penelope Cruz is at one of her worst appearances here, and Ray Liotta comes up about even: he is good, but not one of his standout roles. Paul Reubens is delightful, and I wouldn't mind seeing more of him... but perhaps he is best in small doses.There's some level of sympathy here. Jung crossed an imaginary line with plants, and does begin to realize the importance of family as time goes on. It's a tough call: is dealing wrong? If use is not wrong, and dealers only deal to consenting adults, is that a horrible thing? I think it's a matter of debate.Definitely worth seeing for anyone who likes Johnny Depp or wants to see a true story of the cocaine trade in the 1970sand 1980s. Sure, some of it is a bit of a stretch, but the basic facts seem to be true.",8,0,1,25 March 2010
1408," One of the Few Truly Good Modern Haunted House Stories
","Michael Enslin is a hack writer who travels the country writing about haunted mansions, hotels and cottages... despite not believing in ghosts, poltergeists or even gods. He will have to face his nihilism in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel in New York, where not only apparent ghosts but also his tormented soul comes to get him in his own little prison of the mind.This great (and, in my opinion, overlooked) film comes from Mikael HÃ¥fstrÃ¶m, director of one of 2005's better and more psychologically intense films, 'Derailed'. If you saw 'Derailed', you know what this man is capable of as far as setting a very dark and gritty tone to his movies. Where that film explored rape, kidnapping and blackmail, here we examine why God allows children to die and how families get torn apart in the process (which, while still sad, is far less messy for the viewer).Almost all the great horror tricks are employed here (with the notable exception of the cat fake-out). Bleeding walls, screaming children, hammer-wielding psychos, and some new ideas I've never seen before. One scene where Enslin sees a vision across the street is both creepy and memorable. I was worried when I saw this was Stephen King movie and even ore worried knowing it was PG-13, but they pushed the envelope every chance they got. I never had a moment to be let down in the scary department (yes, I jumped a few times -- even this veteran is not immune).What makes this a more powerful film is that while the superficial story is a man in a haunted room, the real story is his relationship with his wife and daughter. The audience is left being jolted between terror and sadness, not being sure whether to cover their eyes in fright or wipe the tears from their eyes from the family drama. Again, HÃ¥fstrÃ¶m knows how to draw tension amongst families. And John Cusack, who is consistently a powerful actor, is able to fill the shoes given to him.If you went to this movie to see Samuel L. Jackson, you went for the wrong reason, as his role is relatively minor (though, not at all strange, he's the character who delivers the PG-13's one f-word). He does well, there's just not that much of him. What started to lose me (and made me think for a while that I'd have to lower my grade on this one) was the film's length. Although the movie is very good, it carries on a bit long and there are many times where it seems like it should end but just keeps going. I fear that while this works alright in theaters, where complete attention is given, this might lose a lot of viewers when the film comes to video. I was never 'fed up', but I can't deny as much as I loved it I was also fidgety.When's the last time you saw a good haunted house film? A long time. As much as you might have loved Ryan Reynolds getting naked in 'Amityville Horror', you'll love Cusack (not getting naked) much more in this one. Scary creatures and psychological madness combine for what is the horror thriller of 2007 so far. Catch it while in theaters, if possible. The surround-sound experience will really drive this one home. Yes sir, I like it.",8,0,2,6 July 2007
Raging Bull," Not My Favorite Scorsese
","An emotionally self-destructive boxer (Robert DeNiro) and his journey through life, as the violence and temper that leads him to the top in the ring, destroys his life outside it.I do not want to be the one to say bad things about this film, because it is not a bad film. But most of it just did not resonate with me. The story is good, the acting is good, I love the use of the black and white cinematography at a time when color was far more dominant. But I cannot say this is one of the greatest movies ever made.IMDb, AFI, Entertainment Weekly, ESPN and everyone else has this ranked so near the top of their list (IMDB actually only puts it in the top 100, which seems more fair). I am lost... it is a great movie, yes, but one of the greatest? No, it just is not true. DeNiro has done better, Pesci has done better, Scorsese has done better...",7,2,5,21 September 2012
The Iron Giant," Fun 1950s Alien Robot
","A boy makes friends with an innocent alien giant robot that a paranoid government agent wants to destroy.At first, I wasn't really sold on this film because I thought the animation style was a little bit cheesy. I was reminded of Don Bluth and such films as 'All Dogs Go To Heaven'. Not that Bluth made bad films, but by 1999 we were expecting a lot more from our animators.Anyway, my concerns on animation were overshadowed by a genuinely good film with some fun characters. Not a great film, but one that light-heartedly looks at the 1950s and 1960s Cold War era. This is a satire on a child's level. In some ways, it has a similar feel as Joe Dante's 'Matinee' (1993) and could make a good double feature.",6,0,1,23 February 2015
Mary and Max," Not Your Typical Animation
","A tale of friendship between two unlikely pen pals: Mary, a lonely, eight-year-old girl living in the suburbs of Melbourne, and Max, a forty-four-year old, severely obese man living in New York.At the outset, I was a bit skeptical of the high praise this film has received and how it continues (in 2015) to stay on the IMDb Top 250, despite competing with so many classics and the disproportionately-rated superhero movies. Was this a fluke or some hidden gem that has not received enough attention? Indeed, it turns out to be the latter. Although not a children's film like it first appears, that makes it all the better. Jokes about prostitutes, condoms, homophobia, atheism... never in an offensive way, but still subject matter that will never be rated G. And this allows for some very clever, innocent humor.",8,2,5,20 May 2015
Shrek," A Solid Entry in the DreamWorks Canon

Now it seems a bit overshadowed by other entries, including 'How To Train Your Dragon', but clearly they knew what they were doing with the computer-generated medium, and knew how to craft a story from classic elements.Some have said it is best to forget the film had sequels and just focus on the original. Whether or not this is a fair view, it does not matter. No sequel, good or bad, can change the original. And this is a strong original and allows for plenty of exploration of the world.",7,0,1,13 January 2015
The Silence of the Lambs," Modern Masterpiece and For Good Reason
","Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) enters into a relationship with Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant but deranged flesh-eating psychiatrist. He may be her only hope in catching Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), a new serial killer who strips women of their skin for his own nefarious purposes. Can she trust him? 'Silence of the Lambs' won a few Academy Awards, and it's plain to see why. Everyone involved does a wonderful job, and even after several viewings the movie remains fresh and enjoyable. I still haven't figured out what kind of accent Jodie Foster has, and I probably never will. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Lecter, and I think it goes without saying that this will be the role he is remembered for. Maybe not his best role, but certainly his most widely received.The film has a timeless quality to it. Of course, we can tell the year the film was made from the clothing styles and production quality of the film. But there's nothing glaringly time-specific about it (compare it to 'Manhunter' with the pastel jackets). Some things may seem silly and unintentionally comedic (there are excessive amounts of close-ups on Lecter that make me chuckle) but overall it's a good, smooth showing.I'm not going to get into detail about the film, director Jonathan Demme's vision or the changes from book to film (such as the number of Lecter's fingers). The film has been combed through a hundred times by critics and fans, and I'm merely adding an opinion that's been voiced before. But I will say this: as of 2008, the film retains all the qualities and positive aspects attributed to it when it first arrived in theaters. One suspects it always will.",8,2,3,18 June 2008
The Croods," Not Clear on the Appeal
","After their cave is destroyed, a caveman family must trek through an unfamiliar fantastical world with the help of an inventive boy (Ryan Reynolds).How 'The Croods' made it into the final circle of the Academy Awards (while pushing out 'Monsters University') is a bit of a mystery. Reviews, although generally positive, were mixed and everyone seems to be in agreement this was no ground-breaking animation or top shelf humor. And yet this leads to a cartoon show and a video game...The connection between this story and Plato's allegory of the cave has been pointed out, but it is a loose connection at best. If the allegory is boiled down to the basic (and inaccurate) idea that life is more fulfilling outside of the cave, there is a similarity. But any deeper meaning Plato was trying to offer is completely absent in this film which offers no valuable advice.In fact, some aspects seem to be a step backwards. There are more than a few mother-in-law jokes (we still do those?) and even a subtle anti-feminist message. While early on Eep comes across as a strong female lead, once she meets Guy, she is back in the shadow of a man telling her how to live. What could have been a 'girl power' film was instead turned into a generic father-reluctantly-gives-daughter-away story.Again, this film should probably not have been nominated and hopefully has no chance of winning an Oscar. Despite a few clever moments (Nicolas Cage's idea rant stands out) this is a forgettable dud.",7,0,1,27 January 2014
Iron Man," Far Exceeds The Character's Usual Presentation
","I have never been terribly fond of Iron Man. As a comic reader for twenty years, I knew him and have come across him from time to time, but never really found his story that intriguing. He is, basically, Marvel's answer to Batman. That being said, this movie was excellent.I think they fit in all the necessary story parts, and they were executed wonderfully. Robert Downey Jr has finally made the comeback he deserves, and is bigger than ever. I am unclear about the Pepper Potts situation, but think it is being handled well in this film -- she is obviously conflicted, both in love with her boss but also wary of his womanizing. That makes sense. And the way they made his transformation from jerk to somewhat respected is a nice move.Purists might be upset that his origins were moved from Vietnam to Afghanistan, but that would just be protesting nonsense. In order for Stark to fit the timeline of the Avengers story (in the films), he needs to be modern, and I think this was handled excellently.",7,0,4,12 May 2012
Tombstone," Hey, Let's Play Cowboys and...
","What this movie comes down to, without a real need for review, is do you like westerns? If you can't stand them and have no desire to see one, you'll dislike this film. If you like them, even a little bit, you'll probably love this film. It's the telling of the true story of Tombstone with the best cast of any Western: Kurt Russell, Bill Paxton, Val Vilmer, Sam Elliott, Terry O'Quinn, Michael Rooker, that guy from 'Wings', Powers Boothe and others...And the drama is there: a man torn between two women while his family is gunned down. And the action? It's the Old West! Gun fights everywhere you look! But the real story is the mustache parade. Val Kilmer in a silly mustache. Kurt Russell's mustache is a bit large. Both seem rather fake. Terry O'Quinn looks like his is real, not unlike the one he had in 'The Stepfather'. Bill Paxton's mustache is unremarkable. And the best mustache award goes to Sam Elliott. But that's obvious, because Elliott's mustache is his second-best quality (behind his gravely voice). In 'The Big Lebowski' his mustache was massive. In 'The legacy', his mustache actually had a co-starring role on the opening credits. One time I saw Sam without his mustache, and it was like Samson without his long hair. It destroyed the man.Anyway, this film s recommended if you need a western. Otherwise, maybe not. You have to be in that mood, if you know what I mean.",7,0,1,6 March 2006

Deckard, whose job as a 'Blade Runner' was to track down bioengineered beings known as replicants and 'retire' (a euphemism for killing) them, is informed that four have come to Earth illegally.Science fiction and philosophy go hand in hand. From the earliest days up through 'The Matrix' and beyond, it allows the human mind to explore hypothetical situations. This movie is a good action film (though slower than necessary in parts), but carries with it an ethical question: when do robots become human? Do they ever? And should we be constructing them in the first place? (The film sort of skirts this issue, saying they were used for slave labor -- but why bother to give them feelings, senses, sexual organs and so on?) I do not know which of the seven (!) versions is best. I most recently (2016) saw the theatrical, but feel it was lacking something. Definitely the unicorn dream sequence is gone, which is important to the plot. Things are left more ambiguous.",9,0,4,10 April 2016
Mr. Holland's Opus," Make Them Shine, Holland!
","A frustrated composer (Richard Dreyfus) finds fulfillment as a high school music teacher.At first, the story is not about teaching the students, but learning to teach. This is really about the growth of Holland and not such students as Lang. For anyone to learn, they must first care about what they are learning. So one can explain things clearly and get nowhere unless they present it in a context that sparks interest. (Indeed, one can imagine how many things they were 'taught' and forgot until it finally became relevant to them.) And later we get the deaf angle. It seems a little forced and almost exploitative. But it does draw that interesting connection to Beethoven, who himself was deaf. How can one of the greatest composers of all time make music he was not able to hear?",7,1,1,9 June 2015
Monsters University," It's Alright
","A look at the relationship between Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sulley (John Goodman) during their days at Monsters University -- when they were not necessarily the best of friends.Although I enjoyed 'Monsters Inc', I probably did not enjoy it as much as other people did. This, in turn, taints my outlook on this prequel, because in many ways the success of this film relies on the enjoyment of the first one (these are, after all, the same characters and voice talent).Not to say this is a bad film. In fact, it was quite fun and a touching tribute to the world of monsters. I enjoyed it far more than 'The Croods' and would rather have seen this nominated for an Oscar than 'Croods', even though neither has much chance of winning. How can anything with John Goodman and Steve Buscemi be bad?",7,0,0,27 January 2014
Ben-Hur," An Epic -- Literally
","When a Jewish prince (Charlton Heston) is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend, he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge.This is a very long movie. While it is also a very good movie, its length should be the first thing noted because those who are not ready for a long movie (or ready to watch it as two halves) should not do so. It is not fast-paced, with the exception of the notable chariot race scene. This is, in a very roundabout way, a story of Jesus Christ (though you may not be able to fully understand that much of the time).I would have to give this film another try to fully appreciate it. It has aged well, and tells a good story. Does it need to be so long? I do not know. Personally, I have never cared for movies that begin with overtures, but your opinion may vary.",8,1,3,14 August 2012
Casino Royale," The Russian 007
","Armed with a license to kill, Secret Agent James Bond (Daniel Craig) sets out on his first mission as 007 and must defeat a weapons dealer in a high stakes game of poker at Casino Royale, but things are not what they seem.Why do I think Daniel Craig looks like a Russian? I don't know, but that's what I think. And it ruins the role for me. I don't care if James Bond is blonde, brunette, black or white. But he should look English, and for some reason Daniel Craig looks like Vladimir Putin to me.That being said, I think the story and action are good, and it is great to see Mads Mikkelson here, before he really hit it big with 'Hannibal'. It is always nice to see a European actor go international. (He was great in 'The Hunt', by the way, which is a must-see for any Mikkelson fan).",6,4,8,26 June 2015
Toy Story 3," 2010 Was a Fantastic Year for Cartoon Movies
","I had average expectations for 'Toy Story 3'. Being the third in a series, a children's film and having seen 'Despicable Me', I did not think that it could be a 2010 best picture contender. But I was quite wrong.While I still think that 'Despicable Me' is a great film, 'Toy Story 3' really holds its own and maybe even surpasses it. The movie is funny, charming, sad at times... briefly even scary for children. There is a darker tone than previous installments, but that seems okay because the toys are now facing adult problems -- or, more accurately, the problem that their owner is now an adult.Pixar knows what it is doing. They just do not seem capable of making a bad movie. Could this be their first best picture? I do not think so, but there will be a tight race.",9,0,1,6 February 2011
Trainspotting," The Film That Brought Us Danny Boyle
","Renton (Ewan McGregor), deeply immersed in the Edinburgh drug scene, tries to clean up and get out, despite the allure of the drugs and influence of friends.This is one of those strange films that focuses on heroin use, and leaves the user wondering: is this glamorizing or denouncing heroin? With 'Requiem For a Dream', the end was clearly against heroin. Here, it is a bit more ambiguous, because the characters have so much fun. And, with heroin today (2014) being as big a story as it was mid-1990s, the film again becomes relevant.Regardless of message, this showed the world what Danny Boyle could do with a small budget, and it was quite a bit. Thank goodness. Although not everyone loves 'Trainspotting', as a whole we have benefited from the film's success because now we have his other films, not least of which is '28 Days Later'.",7,1,2,17 November 2014
La Vie En Rose," Quite Good
","An un-chronological look at the life of the Little Sparrow, Ãdith Piaf (1915-1963). Her mother is an alcoholic street singer, her father a circus performer, her paternal grandmother a madam.As of now (2015), Edith Piaf has been the focus of a number of films. But it would be hard to say any are better than this one, and the reason is simple: they cast the right actress. Another well-known actress was named as a potential choice, but Marion Cotillard was the only correct one -- she brings a power to the screen that few can. (She may also be the only non-English speaking actress to achieve wide acclaim in the United States).Although I know nothing about Piaf and cannot say if this is accurate, it is certainly well presented and a joy to watch.",7,0,0,7 July 2015
Bull Durham," Possibly the best Kevin Costner Baseball Film
","First of all, I still don't know why this film is called 'Bull Durham'. The team they play for is called the Durham Bulls, but if there's some meaning to bull durham, I'm not familiar with it. So that really confused me.Second, this may be Kevin Costner's best baseball movie. I really enjoyed 'Field of Dreams' a lot, but this one seemed to have more spirit to it. I guess it depends what you want... Tim Robbins co-starring or Ray Liotta.Otherwise, a great film. Kevin Costner is Crash Davis, a catcher who has spent way too many years in the minor leagues. He is training Nuke (Tim Robbins), a pitcher with a lot of potential. And then there's Susan Sarandon, who creates a love triangle when she enters their relationship, claiming sex with her can create a better ball player.Tim Robbins has consistently made great movies, even disposable stuff like 'Nothing to Lose'. And Kevin Costner is an epic actor (which can get on some people's nerves at times). So their interaction is both wonderful and grand, even though there's nothing new about baseball movies or older people teaching the new guy.Susan Sarandon was the worst part of the film. She could have been removed entirely. Why Nuke is attracted to her is unknown ,because she's like Skeletor. And then why is Crash Davis attracted to her, when she's slept with most of the guys on the team? Old, ugly and promiscuous... I don't get it. And as the film goes on, her part gets bigger and bigger. And since she does the voice-overs, I almost wonder if this is her story disguised as a baseball film.There were many scenes that are quite memorable... and I really liked the bull that gives you a free steak.But in the end, after all the fun is over, the sadness sinks in. We realize Kevin Costner will never go anywhere. Maybe he'll fall in love and have kids. Maybe he'll be in the minor leagues forever. But he can never get back to the majors... he is the tragic and fallen hero seeking redemption through Nuke. I won't wax philosophic about that more than I already have, but his character is very deep when really considered.Don't let the boring box cover or Susan Sarandon scare you off. This one is a home run.",7,0,6,23 September 2006
Before Sunrise," The Perfect Transition
","What this movie is, quite simply, is the transition between Richard Linklater's 'Slacker' and Linklater's 'Waking Life'... with just a touch of romance.Two people, one played by 'Explorers' star Ethan Hawke, meet on a train through Europe. After a quick chat, Hawke convinces the other (a French girl) to get off with him in Vienna for a night the two of them will never forget. We then follow them, meeting a fortune teller, some Austrian amateur actors and a bartender who gives away wine to conniving Americans.It comes down to this: if you like intimate conversations about random topics, and have liked Linklater in other films, you need to see this movie (it's only 4.88 at Wal-Mart!). Recommended.",8,1,4,17 March 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Love That Woody
","Two girlfriends on a summer holiday in Spain become enamored with the same painter (Javier Bardem), unaware that his ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), with whom he has a tempestuous relationship, is about to re-enter the picture.Woody Allen presents us a story of love, romance, relationships and (to some degree) culture. Whether we are comfortable with the idea or not, the things expressed here exist: relationships beyond strict monogamy, and beyond cheating. The human emotion can know many kinds of love and many kinds of desire, and a handful are explored here (though not nearly as many as in Allen's classic film on bestiality).If you are going to have a seductive Spanish man, clearly it must be Javier Bardem. At different times the part could have been done by Antonio Banderas or others, but at the time was there a bigger star than Bardem? Surely not.",7,0,1,7 July 2015
The Deer Hunter," Great, But Missed Its Mark on Me
","This film had long intrigued me, mostly because of Christopher Walken and somewhat because of Robert DeNiro. But sadly, despite the film's greatness, it just did not hit me in the gut. I'm going to respond to another viewer's thoughts: 'I think the reason most people don't like this movie is that it is unnecessarily long... I could have done without the hour long wedding scene, but the reason I really don't like it is that it served little purpose... The Godfather wedding is almost as long, but it deeply informs you about the characters... watching the Deer Hunter wedding was like watching someone's wedding video, and it didn't tell you much about the characters... there are many scenes like this in this movie' Now, I tend to agree. The wedding, which takes up like the first third of the film, was not an effective way to get me to care about the characters. In fact, it caused me to get bored early on, and the war scenes had to un-bore me. Luckily, those are really good. But yes, the film as a whole is long for no good reason, and rather than being suspenseful, becomes tedious. An edit cutting 20-30 minutes out would have done wonders for me.And don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with long films. Three hours is fine, sometimes even four hours ('Das Boot' and 'Lawrence of Arabia') is enjoyable. This one just didn't live up to the reputation, and I don't think it allowed DeNiro or Walken to shine. I expect some day this film will fade from 'classic' to 'obscure'.",8,2,4,7 May 2010
Saving Mr. Banks," Quite Remarkable
","Author P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) reflects on her childhood after reluctantly meeting with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), who seeks to adapt her Mary Poppins books for the big screen.There were things about this film that I thought were a bit much. Mostly, the attempt to connect Travers' childhood with her later writing and such. There is no doubt that she took her name from her father, but I am not at all convinced that he inspired her as much as the film suggests. As near as I can tell, she was only 5 years old when he died and probably had few or no memories of the man.That being said, I thought the performances were good and really brought be back to what it may have been like to work with Walt Disney in the 1960s. At first I was not convinced that Tom Hanks could be Disney, but I soon warmed up to it. In fact, I think he was better at Disney than he was for the role of Captain Phillips.",8,3,4,3 March 2014
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Lots of Quirky Fun
","An urbane fox (George Clooney) cannot resist returning to his farm raiding ways and then must help his community survive the farmers' retaliation.I have enjoyed every one of Wes Anderson's movies, but somehow managed to not see this one when it first came out. A shame, as it is every bit as good as the others. Not my favorite, but not my least favorite... and even his lesser films are still more fun than most of the things that get made these days.The cast is exceptional, but it is Anderson's sensibility that really sells this one. He is just so quirky. I have not read the original book, but I assume a few liberties were taken. Maybe Anderson should adapt more Dahl works... he could have made a better 'James and the Giant Peach'...",7,1,2,19 April 2014
Speed," Who Would Believe An Action Film Could Actually Be Good?
","'Speed', with bad actors Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, poor dialogue and a plot that is completely pointless and nonsense, on top of the fact the bus making a jump... not going to happen. How is it that a film that is so bad could actually be so good? Because, let's face it, it's extremely enjoyable, popular and heavily quotable.I blame Joss Wheadon, who was a script doctor on this before becoming a big writer. He could fix just about anything, probably. And maybe having Dennis Hopper helped, too. He's like the perfect villain, so having him here being all creepy and devious pays off. I mean, sure, you could have hired his buddy Jack Nicholson, but there's a difference between crazy creepy and devious creepy.",8,1,1,21 June 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," A Die Hard for a New Generation
","John McClane's daughter is all grown up. Which makes her the perfect target for international terrorists. So when the computer systems of America (electricity, security and more) go under... John McClane must deal with threats both foreign and domestic! Justin Long joins the cast as a hacker who designed security systems for a variety of questionable groups, also inadvertently giving them access to the things he ought to have been securing. He seems a likely choice, being the face of the Mac on commercials. And he looks like a hacker (much smoother than he is in many other roles -- such as 'Dodgeball').Bruce Willis comes back in full force. The older he gets, the tougher he gets. I'd be more than happy for a Die Hard 5. (If Bond can have 22 films, McClane can have 5.) Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the love of my life and the entire reason I watched this in the first place. I wish she had more scenes, but for what she was given she did fine work. (Again, with a sequel, she could be more involved and fight the bad guys directly, you know?) Kevin Smith is what dropped this film from an 8 to a 7. I love Smith's work, especially his earlier stuff. But he's a horrible actor and here only plays a cheesy version of himself. So, boy, that's lame. A balding hacker in his mom's basement? Cast someone else or write it out of the script next time.Quick thoughts: the cgi effects were okay, which shocked me. I thought they'd overdo it, but even the flying cars were acceptable. The pg-13 rating was very nice. You'd think a violent action film would need an R, but I think they squeezed R-level action into the PG-13. And last: are all computer experts ninjas? It seems to be skilled in hacking, you also have to be a black belt in everything.Anyway, a great sequel and I am surprised to find myself saying so. Winstead, Willis and Long shine... get this one in your personal library.",7,1,3,25 January 2008
X2: X-Men United," Why Is This So Well-Rated?
","The X-Men band together to find a mutant assassin who has made an attempt on the President's life, while the Mutant Academy is attacked by military forces.I do not quite get the love for the X-Men movies, particularly this one. So many of the actors look nothing like the characters, the plots are sort of silly. It seems like the producers were more concerned with casting names than with making the stories and characters work. Heck, they even hired Alan Cumming for some reason (though he does alright all things considered).And of of now (2015), they keep making these X-Men movies. So that is well over a decade of the different installments. I do not feel the need to keep watching them.",6,0,3,12 June 2015
The Ringer," I Just Bought My Ticket on the Amtrak to Hell
","If you have high hopes for a film starring Johnny Knoxville that centers around rigging the Special Olympics, you are either very strange or are way too naive (or both). The film has one joke (that mentally handicapped people are funny to watch) and uses it over and over again. Which is amusing most of the time, but more often than not seems to only secure my seat on the bus ride to hell.There is nothing new in this film. The clichÃ© of a man entering a group he finds inferior only to discover they are no less human? It's here. The man who falls in love with a woman but is lying to her about his identity the whole time? Oh yeah, that, too. I could parallel this film with about a dozen off the top of my head, so whoever wrote this certainly was not trying to break any new ground. (Even the premise - rigging the Olympics - had been a South Park episode.) For what it's worth, Johnny Knoxville did a fine job. Trying to imagine him being retarded is not much of a stretch, though he certainly is very good at physical comedy and has no reservations in injuring himself for a laugh. The female lead (Katherine Heigl?) seems to serve no other purpose than to be attractive and not overly bright prospect of the main character. If that was her purpose, she hit the mark.For some cheap laughs, you might want to see this film. But it's not one you want to put as a high priority on your Netflix queue.",3,1,3,6 August 2006
Thor: The Dark World," A Weak Point in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","When Thor's love interest gets cursed with a powerful object, Thor must protect her before an army and its ruthless leader try to get their hands on it to take over the remains of Earth.The strong points of this film are the continuing development of Loki as a villain (and perhaps a hero), Stellan Skarsgard, and Kat Dennings. The weak points are the over use of CGI, the use of Natalie Portman and the general way that Thor does not seem to fit in with the rest of the Marvel universe (even with the vague connection to 'Guardians of the Galaxy').Not that this was a bad film, but it was probably the weakest in the series thus far, and there should be no surprise if we never see a 'Thor III'.",6,1,3,1 September 2014
AmÃ©lie," I Don't Think a More Perfect Film Has Ever Been Made
","At the time of this writing, this film is ranked on IMDb as the 31st greatest film ever made. This is a sad under-ranking. This film is not only the greatest movie ever made, it shouldn't have to compete with such films as the Lord of the Rings, which will be forgotten 10 years from now. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has painted a timeless classic for the modern era.The plot is simplistic: a girl with a vivid imagination sets out to better the lives of those around her, and seeks true love. The twists come in the form of numerous asides, where we see flashes from other people's lives. While these branches and untapped subplots are unrelated, they serve as a reinforcement reminding us of Amelie's healthy imagination.The acting is all wonderful, as the film has a comic element that is very French. I do not know if Americans could have made this. While watching the way the characters interact with each other, I was reminded of my younger days in college, reading Beaumarchais' 'The Marriage of Figaro'. French literature has a rich history of comic genius (from at least the days of Voltaire's 'Candide' if not sooner) and this film translates that energy from page to screen. At the same time, there is a serious existentialist tilt to this: how do we, as insignificant people, affect the world? This point is accentuated more by the fact that Amelie stands alone in the world despite being surrounded by so many people -- much like the girl in Renoir's painting (more on this shortly).Audrey Tautou is particularly charming, in an alluringly beautiful way, but also innocently childlike in her grace and style. While more Americans probably know her today as the woman from 'The DaVinci Code', this will always remain her best film (be that a blessing or a curse). One cannot help but like the character of Amelie -- she quite simply is flawless in her imperfect humanity.The directing? Amazing! Angles, lighting and most of all colors (every color is pushed to the max as if the whole universal was designed by Crayola) are used to make a surreal and inviting world, where even death seems welcome and fun. The few characters who die do not do so in a way that makes us upset or sad, although the timing and manner is most tragic. The greens are the most vibrant, I think... even permeating into the other colors. But rather than blur things with its leaking, it only makes them more fluid and lifelike.And even the subplots are fascinating: Amelie toys with a prospective lover, sends a garden gnome on a trip around the world, searches for a mystery man in red shoes, defends a young imbecile, makes unsuspecting patrons fall in love and helps a sheltered painter find the vision of Renoir.The painter (known as Raymond Dufayel or The Glass Man and played by Serge Merlin) is a crucial central character. He is somewhat of a Sisyphean being, trying over and over again to complete the same task without fully succeeding. But he is also a mentor like Socrates (encouraging the youth to stand up against society) and a surrogate father figure. While Amelie has a father, their relationship is very spartan and business-like; her real interaction comes from Dufayel who guides her in metaphors and allusions.This film also manages to do something very difficult -- make the obscene benign. While the film does have a sexual element and some off-color jokes (one pornographic and another about abortion), we never feel the film has an adult quality to it. Everything seems innocent and pure -- even in the middle of the adult toy store. That must be a very difficult thing to capture as I know of no other film which has done so.I will lay my reputation on the line and say this is the most perfect film ever created by human hands. From beginning to end this film speaks a subtle truth, and shows us that everyone has good points and bad points, flaws and great attributes. I know of no other film that treats its characters as both epic and unbearably human. And this is why 'Amelie' stands out.",10,4,10,29 June 2006
Moonrise Kingdom," A Return to Genius From Wes Anderson?
","A pair of young lovers (Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman) flee their New England town, which causes a local search party to fan out and find them.Many directors have a certain stamp they leave on their films that make it clear who was responsible. I daresay that Wes Anderson more than any other director might be the master of the stamp. If his name appeared nowhere on this film, the colors, characters and quirky plot would just give it away. He makes the indie style mainstream.That being said, this is probably Anderson's best film in years. I cannot say I ever disliked any of his work, but 'Darjeeling Limited' (for example) did not meet the expectations it should have. Here, we have the full Anderson experience: Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, a refreshing Ed Norton, and even Harvey Keitel (who seems to have faded away over the last decade). Bruce Willis was the weakest link, but luckily he was not crucial.A good deal of work went into the production: the creation of the maps, paintings, books and more. I assumed the books were real, and I assumed wrong. I thought it possible that the map was real, but it was not. So this is a credit to the art design crew -- they made the fictional realistic, which is no easy task.The film is nominated for Best Screenplay, and I think that is valid. On a surface level, it is a story of two outcasts and the innocence of young love. That alone makes a good story when told by the right people (as it is here). But then you add the second level, where the children are contrasted with the adults whose relationships have crumbled. We are not weighted down by their negativity, but are still fully aware of it. Perhaps the adults and children are a mirror to each other? The third level is one I am not completely sure how it fits or what it means, but I believe there must be some symbolism to the flood motif. The island is shown three days before a flood, and a play showing Noah's Flood is prominent. More so, Suzy Bishop plays the raven, which was the first bird Noah released to see if the flood had ended. Does it mean something that she was a raven and not the sparrow? I am not sure, but I think so.Some critics have listed this among the best films of 2012. I am not as confident. While certainly top 20, probably not top 10. But still well worth a view.",8,1,4,28 January 2013
The Producers," Comedy Classic
","Producers Max Bialystock (Zero) and Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) make money by producing a sure-fire flop.I regret that despite being a fan of Mel Brooks' work (with a few exceptions) and an even bigger fan of Gene Wilder's work, I never saw this film until now (2012). That is a serious failure on my part.While the film is old, it is hardly dated. The only 'dating' is that the film is such a classic that you might feel like you have seen it before you have. The general plot is well-known. And now, it has a remake and a Broadway version, so it is even more well known.I was a bit surprised by how smutty the film is. While not outright dirty, it rides the line more than a few times for a film that is rated PG. This would easily be at least PG-13 today, and possibly even R.",8,0,1,3 March 2012
Cinderella," Classic Disney, with All the Best and Worst
","Cinderella is raised by her evil stepmother and two stepsisters, who make her do chores and essentially keep her as a slave after inheriting her father's estate. When the prince (with the prodding of the king) decides to throw a ball, Cinderella ends up going with the help of her fairy godmother and some lovable mice.The problem with criticizing 'Cinderella' is that many of the criticisms aren't really related to the film so much as to the story it's based off of. Some feminists decry her reliance on a prince to save her from hardship (a common theme in Disney films). Others have the more general criticism that the film portrays women as little more than future brides with no life outside of her husband.You could also say that the film offers no real hope for those looking to it for inspiration. A girl in a desperate situation is saved at the 11th hour by a magical hag with a wand. Without her, Cinderella would be left to toil and the prince would have chosen some other girl to be the princess. In real life, no fairy godmothers exist, so I guess we are left to suffer on our own with little recourse.These concerns aside, the film itself is sound. The animation is great, and looks even better in the restored edition. I've heard some complaint that the 'dirty' world of Cinderella is too clean, but I think that's really ignoring the fantasy element of the film. It's a simple but effective story, timeless. And the songs are now a part of our culture with good reason.I gave the film a fairly low rating because I don't think there's much about the film that pushed any boundaries. It really played it safe in every way it could. Don't get me wrong -- sometimes following the formula makes a good movie, and I think this is a good movie. But it won't get you recognized as one of the best movies of all time, certainly not by me.",6,2,8,16 December 2008
Kagemusha," The Ultimate in Epic Samurai Tales
","A petty thief with an utter resemblance to a samurai warlord is hired as the lord's double. When the warlord later dies the thief is forced to take up arms in his place.George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola are credited at the end of the film as executive producers in the international version. This is because they convinced 20th Century Fox to make up a shortfall in the film's budget when the original producers, Toho Studios, could not afford to complete the film. In return, 20th Century Fox received the international distribution rights to the film.According to Lucas, Kurosawa used 5000 extras for the final battle sequence, filming for a whole day, then he cut it down to 90 seconds in the final release. Many beautiful special effects, and a number of scenes that filled holes in the story, landed on the 'cutting-room floor.' The version I watched was edited for international distribution. Now, if there is an even longer version than the Japanese version, this is one heck of a samurai epic. That would be what, four hours? And definitely among the best -- if not the very best -- of Kurosawa's later work. Holy moley, those colors! Again, the version I saw seemed to be in standard definition. If Criterion released this in 4K, it would blow minds. (Maybe they have, I don't know.) An absolute must-see for Kurosawa fans or fans of the samurai film (two groups that I presume have plenty of overlap).",8,1,1,23 April 2016
Rear Window," One of Hitchcock's Best
","A wheelchair bound photographer (James Stewart) spies on his neighbors from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them (Raymond Burr) has committed murder.This plot is simple yet extraordinarily complex in its own way and incredibly effective. What comes out of it is one of the most influential films of all time, and arguably Hitchcock's best (though others, including 'Rope', could claim that honor).James Stewart is an impressive lead, and this is likely the finest role for Grace Kelly in her relatively short Hollywood career (before getting swept off to Monaco). Raymond Burr? Very subtle, as he is among the bigger stars here in a surprisingly small part.",9,1,4,12 November 2014
A Night at the Roxbury," As Bad As You Would Expect
","Two dim-witted brothers dream of owning their own dance club or at least getting into the coolest and most exclusive club in town, The Roxbury.Roger Ebert observed that 'the sad thing about A Night at the Roxbury is that the characters are in a one-joke movie, and they're the joke... It's the first comedy I've attended where you feel that to laugh would be cruel to the characters.' That may be a big harsh, but it is not at all wrong. As many have commented, when you take a skit that is funny for a minute or two and try to flesh it out, it rarely works. (Besides 'Wayne's World', few SNL skits really have a life of their own.) Apparently the film has a cult following. I am not sure why. I cannot say I regret watching it, but I also cannot say I feel the need to ever see it again.",5,0,3,19 November 2015

His earlier films, particularly 'Last House on the Left', may have been better, but this is the one that grabbed everyone's attention and today even those who haven't seen a single 'Nightmare' film know who Freddy Krueger is: this film made Craven a master, and established a horror movie icon.With one exception at the end, the special effects are also top notch for the time period. Bodies thrown into the ceiling, blood geysers spraying like mad. The makeup and costuming isn't bad, either... Freddy's burnt face gets even nastier when he starts to bleed maggots.Mike Mayo is a bit cynical when he says, 'Because his powers are so elastic, this little moneymaker can be killed and resurrected as long as he stays in the black.' This is, of course, very true... at this point Krueger seems limitless, and even his origin is vague. Exactly how much sway this had over producers, I do not know. I can't see Craven in the office arguing that the film has sequel potential, especially since this was New Line's first major release.If you see only one Wes Craven film, I guess I have to say make it this one. 'Last House on the Left' and 'Hills Have Eyes' are stronger, more edgy films, but they have not had half the cultural impact as 'Nightmare'. It is no exaggeration to say this film is a part of American history.",7,1,2,29 September 2010
The Truman Show," Very Philosophic
","An insurance salesman/adjuster (Jim Carrey) discovers his entire life is actually a T.V. show.This movie has been brought to ethics and philosophy classes and used as a tool for discussion. Unfortunately it was never used in any class I took (despite being a philosophy major), but I guess we cannot all get that experience.So much to ponder: was it right to treat Truman this way? Was the television executive playing God? If the wife (Laura Linney) was only in it as part of a contract and not because she genuinely cared for Truman, what does that make her? And what if this really happened? Would people watch it or rebel?",7,0,0,18 December 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Excellent Sequel
","Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) become targets of the Capitol after their victory in the 74th Hunger Games sparks a rebellion in the Districts of Panem.Not to deny the first film any acclaim it deserved, but the second is much improved because we are less concerned with love and more concerned with the basic human instinct of survival. We also get more of the political aspects that really provide the story a much deeper meaning.The film is bolstered by a strong cast -- not only the wonderful Donald Sutherland, but some great newcomers like Jena Malone and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hopefully Hoffman's role in future films will not be compromised too terribly by his passing.",7,4,19,16 March 2014
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," A 1980s Cult Classic
","Two seemingly dumb teens struggle to prepare a historical presentation with the help of a time machine.This is the film that launched Keanu Reeves' career and brought George Carlin to a new generation of audiences. Those who grew up in the 80s and 90s may know him better as Rufus than as a comedian.The film has aged a bit in the last twenty-five years, but that is to be expected. Unfortunately, because it is a music-themed film ,this was inevitable. The film is and will always be a 'cult classic', but the idea of the future as expressed here is a bit more bizarre than even originally conceived.The film could also be seen as misogynist, or at least anti-feminist. With the possible exception of Joan of Arc, there are no strong female roles. Missy exists as a trophy wife, and the princesses serve no purpose other than to be brides or girlfriends. A feminist critique would be interesting.",7,0,0,16 September 2014
Casino," A Modern Gangster Film Brought to Epic Proportions
","In short, what happens when you get Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci together in a gangster film told by Martin Scorsese, and stretch it to three hours in length? Pretty much the greatest crime movie of all time. It has the look and feel of 'Goodfellas', but focuses less on the mafia and more on one man's drive to get to the top and avoid the Feds (who at one point actually land in his yard when their spying helicopter runs out of gas).The casting of Sharon Stone is a bit questionable. Not to say she did a bad job, but when you see who else all auditioned, it is odd that she pulled ahead. Stone is now more or less a relic of the 1990s. I would like to have seen Traci Lords or Melanie Griffith take the role of Ginger.Scorsese pretty much never fails, and his track record with DeNiro is strong... this ranks as one of their best films together, no doubt.",8,1,2,29 November 2010
Heat," The First Great Matchup of DeNiro and Pacino
","This film is credited as the first great meeting of DeNiro and Pacino (in the Godfather films, they never shared screen time). And both men are quite exceptional in this piece... if only there were more screen time. Other than about 30 seconds in a diner, you can't see both men on the screen at once, so there's no guaranteeing they were even filmed on the same day.The story is of a cop (Pacino) who puts his full energy into the capture of murderous thieves (DeNiro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, and Ted Levine). But doing this destroys his family life (with stepdaughter Natalie Portman). The goons, as well, find family life is hard to maintain when you're a murderous thief.You already know Pacino and DeNiro can deliver the action, and you know Kilmer can too if you've seen 'The Saint'. And Tom Sizemore? Try picturing him in a romantic comedy... no, he was born for roles like this. So the action is a given.But the emotional tears are also important, and they are what makes this film unlike other ones in the action genre. We actually care that these families are shattered. Also, we have the two main opponents sharing coffee, discussing their motivations and we see they are the same man on the opposite side of the coin. One man not only respects the other, but can completely sympathize with him.I should note this is one of Natalie Portman's earlier roles (alongside 'Leon' and roughly the same time as 'Mars Attacks!'). Her acting is not fully developed yet, and while she can carry most films, I'm pleased her part was so small because she was a weak point. In all honesty, her subplot could have been cut and the movie 10 minutes shorter and there would have been no loss.All this from Michael Mann, perhaps best known for 'Miami Vice' or 'Manhunter'... but thankfully his cast left their bright colored coats at home for this one. If you like bank heist movies, you're going to love this one. More action than 'Ocean's 11' and much more depth than 'Dog Day Afternoon'.",8,1,3,2 October 2006
The Replacements," A Football Film With Heart and A Fat Chinese Guy
","A football team (Washington Sentinels) owned by that guy from Problem Child (the grandfather) goes on strike, so the owner must replace the coach and players with new players. The coach (Gene Hackman) picks a lineup that excels in every way, a group he's had his eye on for quite some time (which really makes no sense if you think about it and realize where he's picking people from, but ignore that).I think there's nothing about the plot an the 'twists' that aren't completely predictable. I've seen many movies like this before and probably will again in the future. The only difference here was the cast.Keanu Reeves delivered a less than stellar performance. He has been known to have good roles (I really enjoyed 'The Lake House'), but he is also known as a really bad actor, and this role really added to the latter. Gene Hackman is a final actor, and was fine in this role... unfortunately it didn't require him to do much besides wear a suit and hat that were forty years out of date.The cheerleaders were, well, decent. Many people have said the cheerleaders are 'hot' (and are supposed to be because of some of the questionable scenes and the fact they're playing ex-strippers). I don't know. The head cheerleader was attractive in a motherly way and one of the cheerleaders was remarkable, but overall they were bland or looked like mental patients. If you're into the 'dumb blonde' thing, maybe they're for you. Personally, I think they could have been written out entirely.The team (besides Reeves) was perfect. The Welsh kicker was interesting and made me want to rent 'Trainspotting', the Chinese guy was hilarious in his quest to gain more weight. He also set up John Madden for his only good line in the film about a 'Fat guy dance'. (Seriously, does anyone really need to see more John Madden?) The x-con was alright. Orlando Jones had a weak backstory, but he's a goofball actor and is given too much screen time in all his films (please stop giving him roles).Overall, a patterned film that was entertaining but not really one that stands out. I'd even rather watch 'Varsity Blues' if I wanted a football film. This one has heart, but unfortunately lacks originality.",6,1,3,29 August 2006
Get Him to the Greek," My Friends Liked It, I Was Bored
","Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) is a washed up rock star, but he has a guardian angel. Record label employee Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) comes up with an idea for a comeback... but the trick isn't making it happen so much as it is getting Snow to the show with his constant distractions.A spin off from the underrated Jason Segel film, 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall', this film just seems to come up short for me in many ways. It has its strengths, such as catchy songs parodying rock and roll excess, and a plethora of bizarre cameos, including economist Paul Krugman, but the film's humor is ruined by too many dull moments.Judd Apatow fans should not be fooled into thinking this is one of his works... he did not write this, nor did Segel (who is credited as the creator of the characters). Not to say the fans won't like it, but they should know what they're getting into.",5,0,3,21 September 2010
Ran," Samurai Legends Meet Shakespeare
","An elderly lord abdicates to his three sons, and the two corrupt ones turn against him.Is this Kurosawa's masterpiece? One would think the title of masterpiece ought to go to 'Seven Samurai' or 'Rashomon', and they are probably right. But an argument can be made for 'Ran'. The blend of traditional Japanese storytelling with Shakespeare? The years Kurosawa put into this, story-boarding every detail? And those hundreds of colorful, handmade costumes? Certainly this deserves recognition.If nothing else, we can probably say this is Kurosawa's finest film in color. He may have been more influential in the 1960s, but this does not mean he ever stopped making great films.",8,1,3,24 November 2014
Cube," Ahead of its Time!
","Seven complete strangers of widely varying personality characteristics are involuntarily placed in an endless Kafkaesque maze containing deadly traps.This film was a hit when it first came out. I do not recall if I saw it then or not. It seems familiar, but not enough to be certain. Regardless, it was clearly influential. Such films as 'Saw II' used very much the same premise, though with a much smaller science fiction aspect. Was this conscious? Maybe, maybe not. But it was no doubt an influence.The weakest thing about this is how one-dimensional the characters are. The cop is as stereotypical as a cop can be, and the math geek and the Asperger's kid... but it still makes for a great story, answering just enough questions to keep you guessing.",7,1,2,2 October 2015
Apollo 13," A Great Space Tragedy / Victory
","NASA must devise a strategy to return Apollo 13 to Earth safely after the spacecraft undergoes massive internal damage putting the lives of the three astronauts on board in jeopardy.First of all, a nice shout-out to the great Roger Corman, who appears here in a cameo, and Clint Howard, who has a cameo himself. Corman had a similar small role in 'Silence of the Lambs', and it is great to see directors he helped raise giving him a nod of appreciation.Today (2015), those who think of a stranded in space movie may think 'Gravity', but 'Apollo 13' did it first and did it better. Maybe they did not have the impressive visuals that 'Gravity' has, but they knew how to tell a good story and build suspense -- and, best of all, it was completely grounded in reality.",8,1,1,24 April 2015
The Thin Red Line," The Ultimate Ensemble Cast For a War Movie
","A cast of many B-grade actors (or at least no Cruises or Pitts or Hankses) tries to overtake a hill in the Battle of Guadalcanal. There is fighting, death and explosions, much as you'd expect from a war movie.I will first say that Netflix lied to me because it said the stars were Woody Harrelson, Sean Penn and John Cusack. A fair warning for you: Penn appears, but Woody has a very small role and Cusack does not even show up until over halfway through the film. So calling these the stars is a bit misleading. Even John Travolta appears almost as much as Woody Harrelson.The two main stars are Elias Koteas (Casey Jones from the ninja turtle movies) and Nick Nolte, regardless of what the packaging says. And both of them are wonderful. Nolte is the hard-nosed commanding officer and Koteas is the man in the field who refuses to let his men die for nothing.The film is powerful, with the conflict between Koteas and Nolte really dividing the audience into those who want to see action and those who want to save lives. And where they infiltrate a Japanese camp, the compassion the Americans show the Japanese is a very interesting spin. Whether it is historically accurate or not, I can't say.But the film is not perfect. It's biggest problem, easily, is the length. Three hours of trying to get up one hill? I've seen 'Hamburger Hill' and this drags even more than that, if I may say so. Cut an hour out of it, or at least a half hour and you'd have an engaging film. But I found myself wanting to pace back and forth a few too many times, and that's certainly not the way to make a movie.I have no plans of watching this one a second time.",7,1,3,18 September 2006
Fantastic Four," Frankly, I Was Shocked And Awed
","A group of astronauts gain superpowers after a cosmic radiation exposure and must use them to oppose the plans of their enemy, Doctor Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon).I grew up on comic books, and I was never thrilled by the Fantastic Four. I cannot pinpoint why, but they were never my thing. Yet, this film took my lack of excitement and turned it around. At least somewhat. It far exceeded my expectations and yet remained as faithful to the comic as possible for a film. The inclusion of 'clobberin' time' and 'flame on' was smooth without being kitsch.The effects are mostly good. With, sadly, the exception of Mr. Fantastic. I found the stretching to be very cheesy (though it gets worse in the sequel). The casting was decent, though I am very confused by Jessica Alba. If the point of casting her was to get her to take off her clothes, mission accomplished. But I think of Sue Storm as a scientist, not a sexual being... and here the casting fails.",7,1,3,9 May 2012
The Great Escape," Takes Stalag 17 and Improves Upon It
","In the tradition of Billy Wilder's 'Stalag 17', we have a group of soldiers (some seemingly American, some British) trapped in a German POW camp. Steve McQueen, who plays the Cooler King, has tried to escape many times before... but now there's a whole campwide effort to dig tunnels under the camp. Can it work? James Garner, who plays the Scrounger, really steals the show. McQueen is top billed, and plays the handsome lead, but he really just works on the outskirts of the plot for most of the film. Garner is right in the center, fulfilling the role William Holden had in 'Stalag' and Morgan Freeman would have in 'Shawshank Redemption'.I also have to give a shout-out to a fairly young Donald Pleasence, who plays Flight Lt. Colin Blythe 'The Forger'. Okay, maybe not that young, but for those of us who know him from the horror films of the 1980s... (And best of all, Pleasance was an actual POW in a German camp during WWII.) 'Great Escape' is humorous, it has characters we actually give a hoot about, and it had a major influence on a lot of later great films: 'The Goonies' and 'Shawshank Redemption', for example. I wish I could say more about how great this film is... it's really worth a viewing or two.",8,0,3,1 April 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Best of the Series So Far... But That Doesn't Take Much
","After Edward's proposal to Bella at the end of 'New Moon', a few loose ends need to be tied up: Bella must confront her feelings for Jacob, and they all must face Victoria, the vengeful vampire who hungers for Bella's death. If they can achieve this, smooth sailing!Working off a book that my friend Tina cites as the 'least memorable' of the series, I felt the film did a really good job bringing the story to life. Unfortunately, when you're working with a weak story, there is only so much you can bring to the film. The strongest parts of the book, for me, were the flashbacks, and indeed this was the best part of the film.Overall, this story has little plot. I'm pleased to say the romance and sap has been toned down yet again, the action is slightly improved, but overall the film is nothing but a speed bump between 'New Moon' and 'Breaking Dawn'. You could probably skip this film entirely and not miss an important piece of the story (though you would miss the fleshing out of Jasper and Rosalie).Sadly, director David Slade does not take the stylistic approach I felt he was capable of. After his 'Hard Candy' and '30 Days of Night', I knew he was comfortable with edgy topics and dark imagery. He does not take that route, instead mimicking the style of the first two films. I respect his adherence to continuity, and I know he had to work in the PG frame, but still... the Harry Potter films took stylistic turns with new directors (most notably in the third film with Alfonso CuarÃ³n), and the producers should not have been afraid to make that choice.Professional reviews have been largely favorable, for reasons that escape me. The rating sits at 4.8 on IMDb (as of August 2010) and I find that to be much more realistic. The film showed no great writing, directing... and Kristen Stewart's acting is one flat note as it always is. Where is the emotion? Shame on reviewers who caved in and praised this film.Roger Ebert, bless his heart, gave the film only two stars and two thumbs down (though he loved 'Karate Kid' around the same time, so he's not flawless). He understands what appeals to the audience: 'A sweet girl is forced to choose between two improbably tall, dark and handsome men who brood and smolder and yearn for her.' (His review is worth reading for his comments about Edward's hairy eyebrows and what he sees as homoerotic tension.)I take issue with the inclusion of Bree Tanner. She was singled out by the camera, and the promotional clips talked about her, presumably in an effort to help sell the Bree book. But her role is ultimately rather small, and her name is not mentioned once -- if you didn't read the book, you're not going to understand why she is even in this film. In fact, maybe she shouldn't have been.If you saw the first two films, you're probably going to see this one. If you didn't, why see this one first? In fact, if you can avoid all three you are probably better off. While I enjoyed sitting in the theater heckling on opening day, I have very little desire to ever return to the city of Forks, Washington... though I know, sadly, that I will.",5,4,7,6 August 2010
Click," A Predictable Film That Pulls The Heartstrings
","Adam Sandler is given a universal remote by Morty, the Angel of Death (played by Chris Walken). Sandler begins to fast-forward his life and before long he begins to skip all the day to day aspects of life.The previews leave you with the impression this is a comedy, and there are some parts I found a little funny. But overall this is a drama, and you might cry once the sad music begins playing. Just a fair warning. It happened to me and my brother, it could happen to you.Sandler is not particularly funny in this film, though it has been pointed out to me he rarely is ever funny. His strength is in playing off his co-stars, and he wasn't really given good co-stars to play with here. His best moment, I thought, was with Rob Schneider, who is by no means a great actor.Chris Walken, who is an expert comedian, was not really give much to work with here. His character is neither humorous nor as serious as an angel of death should be. As much as I love Walken ,anyone could have played his role.Hasselhoff was great and this really showcased his potential as a film actor. He has a great presence, and the subtle joke of being around beautiful women (assuming that was a joke) was very nice.Henry Winkler? For some reason he seems to be in this movie just to be in it... he was not properly utilized, being even less interesting here than in 'Scream'.Click is alright, even though you can guess every second of the movie. It is one of those films you might want to watch once a year to keep life in perspective, like 'It's a Wonderful Life', 'The Wizard of Oz' or 'Bambi'.",6,0,1,20 October 2006
Pineapple Express," The Best Drug-Themed Film Since 'Half Baked'
","An adult stoner who happens to be dating a high school girl witnesses a murder. Rather than report it, he turns to his dealer for help. Due to paranoia, they both find themselves on the run from the killer, another dealer. This becomes comedic when the pair are forced to involve the girlfriend and her family.I was growing weary of Seth Rogen. Over the past few years, his face can be seen pretty much everywhere, and if a comedy is being filmed, somehow he manages to appear in it. And, frankly, he's not excessively funny. He's not a horrible actor, but is being overexposed and risks becoming obsolete too quickly (though, perhaps, this is his goal). That being said, he was great for 'Pineapple Express'. Alongside James Franco (in his best role since 'The Ape'), this a comedic duo to be reckoned with.I have to give the promoters of this film credit. While I initially had little interest in seeing it, this may have been a smart move on their part. I think word of mouth carried this film, and it should have -- you don't want to give away too much in a trailer or the viewer gets let down. None of the jokes are revealed in the trailer, and maybe i missed this, but I didn't even know it was a drug-themed film. That surprised me greatly. As far as drug-themed films go, this ranks as one of the all-time best (alongside, perhaps, 'Half Baked').If you don't mind drug references and adult men dating high school girls, this is a comedy to see. I found myself sucked in and I didn't want to use the bathroom or grab a new beer at any point. My attention span comes and goes, but with this film, they had me firmly in their grasp.",7,1,4,29 August 2009
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The Definitive Monty Python Film
","King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are in search of the Holy Grail. Along the way, they must face off against killer rabbits, lonely women and the police.As the film is over thirty years old and has been sen by millions, there's little need to write another praising review. But let's just say this: Monty Python knows humor. Or, perhaps, knew humor. Some may debate about which film of theirs was the best -- some prefer 'Life of Brian' or 'The Meaning of Life' -- but I don't think any fan dislikes 'Holy Grail', and I would say it's the best film to introduce to a Python virgin.Sure, British humor isn't the same as American humor. And modern humor isn't the same as humor in the 1970s. But this doesn't mean one is better than the other -- there's a timeless quality to 'Holy Grail'. I was first exposed to it in my youth, maybe fifteen years ago or more... and it was already a classic.That's all I'll say. No trying to push this film on anyone... it's probably one you've already seen or have been told to see. It stands as one of the few comedies in IMDb's top 250, and with good reason -- this film hits home like no other comedy can.",8,1,2,9 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Way Star Wars Was Meant To Be
","Any comments here refer to the theatrical release, not the pile of rubbish known as the special edition. Rick McCollum should be tracked down and given a good kick in the pants.In your epic battles of good and evil, 'Empire Strikes Back' pretty much takes the cake. We have everything here -- characters with depth, tragedy, romance, adventure... aliens that are believable. It has become clichÃ© to compare 'Star Wars' to 'Lord of the Rings', and that's not entirely unfair... but, really, 'Star Wars' is better and 'Empire Strikes Back' is the best.As Dante Hicks says in 'Clerks', this film is the best because it imitates life, 'a series of down endings'. Sometimes life is better than that, but it's often not. And whereas most movies want happiness, this one put Luke and Han in a bunch of bad situations with no hope of escaping unscathed. That's what makes this fantasy very much reality.",9,1,3,7 April 2010
Minions," Awfully Disappointing
","Minions Stuart, Kevin and Bob are recruited by Scarlet Overkill, a super-villain who, alongside her inventor husband Herb, hatches a plot to take over the world.I don't want to be the bad guy, but I thought this was an awfully dull movie. I like both 'Despicable Me' movies and I generally like the minions, but something was off here. Really the only character I found humorous was Herb Overkill. The Nelsons were also okay, and I wouldn't have minded more with them.Scarlet Overkill was a drag. She was too over-the-top, her dresses just too much and she was too much... too much. I guess that's the irony of naming a character 'overkill', but she just didn't have the right mix of humor and evil.On a positive note, the soundtrack is very, very good.",5,0,0,24 April 2016
Aladdin," The End of Disney's Golden Years
","Aladdin, a street urchin, accidentally meets Princess Jasmine, who is in the city undercover. They quickly grow to love each other (as happens in movies), but she can only marry a prince.Disney's second golden years were 1989-1992, which were unfortunately quite brief. Of course they had hits before that and after that, but for these few years every film was an instant classic. 'Aladdin', with its excellent music and the inclusion of Robin Williams, just hit home so hard (and spawned multiple sequels and a television show).How do you critique a film that everyone loves? You simply do not. I guess if I was forced to say anything negative, it would be that Aladdin and Jasmine look a tad too similar and some think they are siblings separated at birth -- and that would not be right. When Aladdin tells a guard that Jasmine is his sister, it seems plausible!One thing about the film is how it has aged in a way that was unexpected. In 1992, terrorism was not what it is today (2016). Although the film is innocent and there is really nothing offensive about it, one wonders if Disney could have made a film about the Middle East with characters who praise Allah in today's climate.",8,2,3,25 July 2013
A Walk to Remember," If You Don't Like This Movie, You're An Insensitive Jerk
","The story is simple: a rebel boy with a broken childhood (Shane West) gets placed with a good Christian girl (Mandy Moore) and she begins to change him into a better person. Yes, the plot is really that simple.I have seen this movie a bit more than a handful of times and would go so far as to say the film is my third favorite movie of all time (behind 'Mallrats' and 'Waterworld'). So if my opinion is a little biased, my sincerest apologies.The star of this film is Shane West, who went on to be a big star on the television show 'ER' and the mismanaged film 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'. I was convinced that he was a rebel, a lover and a confused little boy. He seemed very good at expressing a wide range of feelings and it was easy to identify with him. Excellent casting, especially considering at the time he was an unknown.Mandy Moore also stars, but she is clearly following Shane's lead. With the exception of her solo scene (where she will amaze you with her vocal beauty and stunning good looks), she doesn't really do very much. She walks with her head down and talks in a monotone voice. There are times where I wasn't sure if this was bad acting or a poorly written character. But maybe you won't notice. I didn't notice until my third or fourth viewing (and I think it helps if you're watching with someone you care about). Even in her solo scene, the director seems to be unsure of what angle he wants to work with, which seems to distract from the whole. My friend Shannon also found the song a bit long, although I disagree. Multiple viewings are required to pick up on all the subtle hints left throughout the film about the twist. You might catch some, but others you will completely miss. I guarantee. I think the budget went almost entirely to the soundtrack. Daryl Hannah ('Kill Bill', 'Blade Runner') and Peter Coyote ('Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis') must have worked for free, because there are something like thirty songs in this movie (including at least three by Mandy Moore, but a variety of other things like Jars of Clay and 'Big Pimpin' appear). If you pay attention to just the music, you'll notice very few scenes aren't loaded with some song -- so again, is the movie selling the soundtrack or is the soundtrack selling the movie? But anyway, yeah, watch this with someone you love. You might cry your eyes out. I did on my first viewing in the theater with my girlfriend at the time. Of course, if you're a girl, you might cry anyway. And that's cool. Guys like chicks who cry. We totally dig that. Why do you think we let you watch Lifetime? This film, like Lifetime, is a guilty pleasure -- maybe nothing Oscar-worthy, but a fun and emotional movie. Also, it makes a great precursor for the much bigger and much sadder Nicholas Sparks masterpiece, 'The Notebook'.",9,0,2,10 May 2006
Inside Llewyn Davis," Really Good....
","A week in the life of a young singer as he navigates the Greenwich Village folk scene of 1961.'Inside Llewyn Davis' has been highly acclaimed, and was voted the 11th best film of the 21st century by 177 critics in a 2016 BBC Culture poll. This is very shocking. The film is indeed quite good, but 11th best film of the last 15 years? That is high praise, especially for a film that barely got noticed by the Academy.What I enjoyed most was the music, as I'm sure most people did. Having Justin Timberlake involved was a smart move, both for the film and for him. I have been quite impressed how his singing and acting have outgrown his boy band image. Very few of his era have made the transition so smoothly.",7,2,5,16 June 2017
Sin City," A Visual Achievement
","A film that explores the dark and miserable town, Basin City, and tells the story of three different people, all caught up in violent corruption.Although the use of digital filming and CGI is very contentious, Robert Rodriguez found a way to make it work to his advantage in a way that may not have been possible with traditional film. The way the black and white brings the noir to life, blending smoothly with the rare other colors... it is the only way to bring a comic book to life. (A similar style is in 'The Spirit', which does not get nearly the respect it deserves.)This casting is incredible, as it is varied and really brought the best performances out of Alexis Bledel, Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba that their careers ever had. Mickey Rourke was re-invented, and this may have been one of the last great Bruce Willis roles. Such a powerful film.",8,1,2,5 December 2014
Saboteur," An Early Hitchcock Classic
","Aircraft factory worker Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) goes on the run across the United States when he is wrongly accused of starting a fire that killed his best friend.I sadly have to say this film did not hold my interest as much as I hoped it would. While it is pretty suspenseful, involves a wrongly accused man, and even has some circus sideshow freaks as supporting characters... it just could not get me fully into it.Of course, this is my fault and not the fault of the film.

","Chauvinistic morning show commentator Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) makes his perpetually single producer (Katherine Heigl) the subject of a series of romantic tests in order to prove the theories on relationships he espouses on his segment called 'The Ugly Truth.' But will his experiments help her find love, or is she just a hopeless case? The film also has some good supporting cast members with Cheryl Hines, Bree Turner, and the actress who plays Shirley from 'Community'.There is some pesky cinematography, with a clichÃ© use of cameras circling people in conversation. And a really bad hot air balloon scene. Most of the time it is standard with nothing of note -- not surprising, as no romantic comedy has ever been made by a notable director or cinematographer.Gerard Butler's character is harsh, crude and somewhat immature, but as the host of his own show, he is actually fairly accurate. In some ways, he is the more rational version of Tom Cruise from 'Magnolia'. And what a deal, too, since Butler is the discount version of Russell Crowe. Although I was somewhat shocked at times, I liked the male lead.Another reviewer talks about Heigl: 'Despite her big talk about portrayals of women in film, she returns again and again to gender stereotypes that are so formulaic they make me cringe.' This review is becoming standard, with Heigl speaking out about one-dimensional women (whom she calls 'shrews') while still starring in romantic comedies, which are the epitome of films pushing flat female characters.Roger Ebert says 'the comedy bogs down in relentless predictability and the puzzling overuse of naughty words.' He also finds it amazing that 'this raunchy screenplay was written by three women.' Not sure about the second point, but the predictability is true enough (are you surprised?) and the naughty words did make me question who the audience was. Is this a way to lure men in to see a woman's film? Who knows?Mysteriously, I actually sort of liked this movie, even if I thought it was horrible and would never recommend it. That might not make sens,e but it is true. The soundtrack was alright, too, which caught my attention immediately by opening the film with Katy Perry.",6,1,3,15 February 2011
Gangs of New York," I Have Now Been Exposed to the Genius That Is Day-Lewis
","Let me say this film was fantastic and a marvel to behold. The only reason I have given it a 9 instead of a 10 is because I always feel there is room for improvement no matter how great a film (in this case, perhaps the director's cut would warrant a 10). I was also a bit displeased that U2 was involved with the music, but I cannot honestly say the music was bad.Coming in around three hours, and taking up two discs, some people would consider this movie a bit on the long side. Me? I would gladly have sat through another hour of this epic masterpiece. I have watched it twice now (that's six hours) and wouldn't mind a third time in the future. The storytelling is crisp, fresh and bold -- the characters believable, three-dimensional and asking for our empathy. As much as I wanted to hate The Butcher and root for young Amsterdam, I couldn't help but feel I knew exactly where the villain was coming from. In his own way, he is the American hero he makes himself out to be.The story starts off with you thinking the plot is a simple tale of a son avenging his father's death. But this is only one plot line. It's a story of immigration, politics, the Civil War and of loyalty and honor. Such historical figures as P. T. Barnum and Horace Greeley grace the screen to give the film a wider context which it willingly and eagerly accepts. The battle scenes are some of the best you'll ever see with great carnage and some vibrant and imaginative costumes. The costumes in general are amazing with their unique styles that could only have worked in this film. If you don't like blood, this might not be the movie for you, but is tame in comparison to many other choices out there and less violent than many war films.I am not very familiar with director Martin Scorsese's work, but based on this film and 'Goodfellas' I would say that he could easily be considered one of the best directors of our time (many people surely already think of him in this way). 'The Departed' really clinched this belief for me. While Scorsese received the Oscar for 'Departed', I think he really earned it during 'Gangs of New York'. But, better late than never.DiCaprio delivers his strongest performance ever in this movie, or at least up to this point in his career (which is saying a lot coming from a fan) and Daniel Day-Lewis shows us he is the very definition of what a perfect method actor should be. I believed he really was Bill the Butcher and I think at times he believed it, too. No other character from film stands out in my mind as being as memorable as he. Even Cameron Diaz, whom I extremely dislike, put on a dazzling display. My only complaint about her in this film is that she is Cameron Diaz, but I guess she has little control over that.The sets? Awesome. Who needs crappy computer imagery when you have sets like these? I could go on and on for pages at a time about this movie, but I think you understand where I am going: completely perfect film.",9,0,2,17 July 2006
The Cabin in the Woods," A Great Twist on the Horror Genre
","Five friends go for a break at a remote cabin in the woods, where they get more than they bargained for. Together, they must discover the truth behind the cabin in the woods.The trouble with writing a review for this film is that I risk giving too much away, so I will just not say anything at all. The creators -- Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon -- have taken the horror genre and turned it on its head. The themes that have been done to death are satirized here while maintaining a scary atmosphere.What a shame that this film got caught up in MGM's financial problems and took almost three years to get released. Chris Hemsworth needs more exposure, and Richard Jenkins never disappoints.",7,0,2,13 August 2013
Spectre," Waltz Makes It Worthwhile
","A cryptic message from Bond (Daniel Craig)'s past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organization. While M (Ralph Fiennes) battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind SPECTRE.Each Bond film really needs to be viewed on its own merits, because trying to determine the continuity is confusing. This time within the series' continuity, the version of Spectre that appeared in 'Diamonds Are Forever' was written out of the timeline with the 2006 reboot of the franchise in 'Casino Royale', making its appearance in 'Spectre' its first in the new timeline. So just pretend you never heard of Blofeld or Spectre, although you probably have.The continuity is also strange with the change of casting on M and Q, but it is a good change. The younger, fresher Q is a good attempt to move the series into the 21st century. The idea of blood that can be tracked makes sense, but probably would have sounded ludicrous in earlier entries. The action scenes are also much better filmed than 'Quantum of Solace', making this a strong follow-up.What does the future hold for James Bond? As of now (September 2017), there is no firm date or title as far as I know. Seems like it might be time to bring him back...",7,0,0,9 September 2017
Braveheart," An Enjoyable Film, But Winner of Five Oscars... Really?
","William Wallace loses his father at a young age. After going away for a while, he returns (now as Mel Gibson) to raise a family. That dream quickly comes to an end when his wife is assaulted and killed by English soldiers. He becomes a patriot in a romantic rage, not resting until England gets its boots off the throat of Scotland.Historian Sharon Krossa notes that Scotsmen did not wear kilts at this time, saying that this is akin to 'a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits' and further that 'The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate -- in short, just about nothing is accurate'... which more or less sums up my primary complaint about this film.I enjoyed it as a story about an oppressed people rising up against their masters, even if it didn't really have any basis in reality. I was a bit confused about Gibson as Wallace, with hair styled by the same person who helps Dog the Bounty Hunter. And I'm not sure how this received 'Best Picture' or 'Best Director'. I do not think it's a bad film or bad direction, but I have to believe the other films this year must have been considered pretty bad for Mel Gibson to enter the list of legends and giants. I would say, for example, that 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is a better film.I had the film presented to me as 'chick flick', and I can see that. Despite the violence and political message (about freedom and independence and nationalism), the underlying theme is that Wallace loved his wife and fights in her honor... though he doesn't really take issue with hooking up with his enemy's wife. I guess two wrongs make a right?I see this film as a bridge between 'Spartacus' and '300', as a story of a small number of people fighting against a much larger enemy. Like Spartacus, Wallace is to some extent a slave. Like the Spartans, the Scots have everything against them when fighting the English. Despite the parallels, the sad fact is that 'Spartacus' is the best film, and '300' the least... seems that uprising films are becoming less grand.",7,6,12,21 March 2010
Joy," A Misstep in David O. Russell's Career
","Joy is the story of the title character (Jennifer Lawrence), who rose to become founder and matriarch of a powerful family business dynasty.Jennifer Lawrence may be America's Sweetheart, and over the last few years we have gotten used to her collaborations with Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro and director David O. Russell. But this seems to be a misstep in the group's collective career.Lawrence has been praised for this role, even taking home a Golden Globe for it. She is up for the best actress Oscar, as well. The difference being that the Globes divide the categories between drama and comedy, whereas the Oscars lump everything together. It makes things a bit tougher. And, frankly, this is not Lawrence's best role. She has the luck of not facing Amy Adams, Meryl Streep or one of those perennial nominees. But comparing her in this film to Brie Larson in 'Room'? No contest.Although a ridiculously fictionalized account of Joy Mangano's story, I enjoyed it. At least the second half (the film is very slow to get going). It had a quirkiness to it that might have been more appropriate in a Wes Anderson film. The plumber is especially amusing. It also, strangely enough, made me a little curious about the history of QVC and the Home Shopping Network.But really, this is not an instant classic and will probably quickly fade. 'American Hustle' was great, and 'Silver Linings Playbook' (though not my favorite) is much more memorable. But you can't have one of the best films every year, so we will have to wait and see what Russell comes up with next time.",6,1,3,28 February 2016
True Romance," Tarantino's Breakthrough
","Clarence (Christian Slater) marries call girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette), steals cocaine from her pimp (Gary Oldman), and tries to sell it in Hollywood, while the owners of the coke try to reclaim it.If you want to study the evolution of Quentin Tarantino, you have to start here. Plenty to take note of: the dialogue is dense, there are plenty of references to Sonny Chiba. Probably dozens of film references so obscure no viewer will ever find them.Somehow this ended up in the hands of Tony Scott. Luckily it did. Not only is he a skilled action director, but he did very little to water down the elements Tarantino put in place. In many ways, this is just as much a Tarantino film as a Scott film.And that impressive cast? Wow. Anybody who was anybody in the 1990s makes an appearance.",8,1,2,5 May 2015
Happy Feet," From the Director of Mad Max...
","Into the world of the Emperor Penguins, who find their soul mates through song, a penguin is born who cannot sing. But he can tap dance something fierce! This is an awful attempt at a musical. Too many songs, many not very good, mixed together. If it were not for the fact people love penguins, this never would have succeeded. And somehow it won Best Picture? Something about that seems very wrong. Did Disney have no princesses? Did Pixar take the year off? The underlying story that has been told a thousand times -- be who you are even when you are different from everyone else -- and it is a good lesson. But it is far from clever, and the environmental angle also falls flat.",5,0,0,15 July 2015
Her," The Positives in the Human Condition
","A lonely writer (Joaquin Phoenix) develops an unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system (Scarlett Johansson) that is designed to meet his every need.If we say nothing else about 2013 in movies, we must concede the following: this was Spike Jonze's year. Matthew McConaughey has been a rising star, and both 2012 and 2013 were banner years for him. Amy Adams also gives a pair of winning performances with this film and 'American Hustle'. But Jonze, on top of writing and directing this film, was involved in two other Oscar nominees: 'Bad Grandpa' and 'Wolf of Wall Street'. Is the man behind 'Adaptation' and 'Being John Malkovich' finally getting the full respect he deserves? What is most interesting about 'Her' is that although it requires good acting to get its points across, the acting here is never the focus. Indeed, Phoenix received no nomination for his role (admittedly not his strongest performance) and Johansson was not even on set -- her lines were dubbed over the original actress! The two big nominations for this film are both for Jonze, one for writing and the other for best picture. Jonze won the Golden Globe for his writing, and I would not be terribly surprised if he took the Oscar, as well.The best film of 2013 for elucidating the darkest parts of the human condition is 'Act of Killing', a documentary set in Indonesia. But 'Her' nails the positive aspects in a very touching and sincere way. Humans are great creators of artwork of many kinds, but their greatest asset is the ability to love. We are capable of loving everyone in a general sense and individuals in a very deep way that probably no other creature can match.Can we love a machine? Other films and novels have tackled this, generally accepting that if a machine takes on human form it could be quite possible. With 'Her' we go a step further -- no physical form whatsoever, just a disembodied voice with a near-infinite intelligence. Is such a thing capable of loving or being loved? This film suggests yes, and makes a strong argument for that.But the underlying theme is that humans are meant to love humans. As much as we can confide in a computer and even open our hearts to it, there would always be something missing. Perhaps the physical touch (a single hug can be powerful), but even the ability to relate. Could a computer ever fully 'get' the full range of human emotion? As much as many of us look forward to a future with more intelligent computers, and would be willing to accept the widespread popularity of high pants and bad mustaches, there is a comfort in knowing that human beings will always be important to other human beings for the foreseeable future. As Eden Ahbez wrote, 'The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.' Is this the best picture of 2013? Probably not. Is it the best screenplay? Possibly. But regardless of what the Academy decides, this is a film worth seeing by everyone (except maybe kids).",8,1,4,16 February 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Danny Boyle's Best Work to Date?
","A young man (Dev Patel) appears on the Indian version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' He wins, but is quickly suspected of cheating because of his lower-class background. But he is able to explain how he knows each and every answer.The film is directed by Danny Boyle, who had previously dazzled audiences with a wide variety of films including 'Trainspotting' and '28 Days Later'. This took his status as 'great' and pushed it up over the top, into Oscar status...The film is, on the surface, the story of one man who strikes it rich. But this is, of course, not the real story: it is an exposition of India and Indian culture, showcasing the poverty that runs rampant there in the world's largest democracy. We see piles of trash, pits for excrement, and more unsavory things being just a part of life for the people in this film. Having one of the biggest economies may not mean much when you also have an overpopulation problem.I love the rocking soundtrack with a distinct Indian flavor, but also plenty of suspense and energy. And not just in the music... will he or will he not win the money? There is no doubt this deserved to be noticed by the Academy. In fact, Danny Boyle's earlier films deserved to be more than the cult films they have become. But better late than never, I suppose. Please do yourself a favor and see this film.",8,2,4,30 November 2010
Mad Max: Fury Road," Surprisingly Suspenseful and Epic
","A woman (Charlize Theron) rebels against a tyrannical ruler in post apocalyptic Australia in search for her homeland with the help of a group of female prisoners, a psychotic worshiper, and a drifter named Max (Tom Hardy).Without a doubt, 'Mad Max' is the surprise success of 2015. While it is not surprising that a big budget reboot of a popular science fiction series would be a commercial success, how could anyone have predicted it would be a critical darling as well? And yet, it has found its way on to numerous top ten lists and picked by many as the movie of the year. 'Mad max' even has the second most nominations for the Oscars, which is unbelievable.The movie has its shortcomings. The plot is... well, more or less non-existent. There is almost no character development. And even if you know the mythology of Mad Max, it will be more than a little confusing for the first hour trying to figure out what 'war rigs' are, and why a bunch of pale guys have Max strapped to a car. And why do we have a man with a flame-spouting guitar? What purpose does he serve? So it is not a shock that of its impressive list of nominations, none are for the writing or the acting. How could they be? While there is probably an art to scripting fights, this is really fleshed out on set. And the acting is... well... hard to say. Most of the good moments were probably handled by stunt people.But the categories of costume, makeup, production design, effects and more are all clearly visible. Even the cinematography. This is a dystopian future in a desert, and yet Australia looks more vibrant than ever before. I would not expect the film to take home a cinematography award, but it is obvious why it was nominated. The best bet for a stature is in production design, and maybe in visual effects, but then they would have to fight off 'Star Wars'.What will likely happen is 'Mad Max' ends up being the biggest loser of the Oscar ceremony. With ten nominations, it has just about the most to lose... it will be lucky to go home with one or two. Because, frankly, the Best Picture nomination is a fluke. This is not the sort of film that typically gets the nomination, and it is far less likely to win when it is supported by mostly technical achievements. It simple does not have the dramatic weight of competitors 'Revenant' or 'The Martian'.The odds are better for a Best Director win. While this is unlikely, it is not impossible. Alejandro G. IÃ±Ã¡rritu and Tom McCarthy are the front-runners, but 'Max' and director George Miller can edge out 'Room' and 'Big Short', right? Seeing a cult director from Australia win would be incredible. Not likely, but possible, and certainly a nice change...",8,2,9,17 January 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Surprisingly Enjoyable Film
","WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield), who served during the Battle of Okinawa, refuses to kill people, and becomes the first man in American history to receive the Medal of Honor without firing a shot.Based on the posters and previews and such, I really thought this was going to be a war movie. And, of course, in many ways it is, since much of the second half takes place on the battlefield. But there is much more here -- romance, morality, and the strong will of Doss, an unusual Seventh Day Adventist.What made this film especially great was the inclusion of Vince Vaughn. Although he never turned the film into a comedy, he brought a humor to the story that really made it well-rounded and enjoyable. That was a fine bit of casting.",7,3,6,25 February 2017
The Runaways," Enjoyable, But Not as Great As Expected
","This film is something of a biopic, following the band the Runaways from its inception to its disbanding. In particular, the focus is on Cherrie Currie and Joan Jett, leaving the other members -- notably Lita Ford -- as mere background footage.I liked 'Runaways', but it's really not all that great. If you don't already have a solid understanding of who Joan Jett, Cherrie Currie and Lita Ford are, it didn't really explain things. It was also lopsided in that it focused on Joan despite being based on the book about Cherrie, and Kristen Stewart made very little attempt to go outside her 'safe' range of acting. In other words, it was like watching Stewart, not Jett.Dakota Fanning is capable of amazingly innocent or not-so-innocent roles, but despite this film being based on Currie's biography, her character comes off as the minor one to Joan Jett. Granted, as Jett today is the bigger star, this makes sense... but then the focus was disjointed. Fanning was able to be a dirty glam-loving rebel, so it is too bad her part was played down.Beyond that, as I said, the focus was disjointed and you had to know the story going into it. Nothing was expressed too explicitly, so when the band rises and falls, and meets up with various problems, it seems that none of them are fully explored. One solution would be to add twenty or thirty minutes on to the movie, but this would do little to save it if that filler was just more of Kristen Stewart.",6,0,2,16 August 2010
The Breakfast Club," The Quintessential Film of the 1980s
","Five high school students, all different stereotypes, meet in detention, where they pour their hearts out to each other, and discover how they have a lot more in common than they thought.Typically when you have this sort of plot, it is going to fail miserably because it is so contrived and stretches the bounds of the imagination. I mean, really, even if these kids had detention together, would they strike up a conversation or just sit silently for eight hours? But in the 1980s and in the hands of John Hughes, it works. This film, more than any other, defined the 1980s for a generation and really crystallized what it meant to be in the Brat Pack. Sure, we might not say all these people are in the BP and not all the BP is in this movie (it is a a very fluid, malleable category), but this is a must-see and one that most of us can watch again and again.And of John Hughes' films, only one ('Ferris Bueller's Day Off') has debatably had a longer-lasting impact.",8,2,3,16 July 2013
Gladiator," Great Roman Epic, Better On The Second Viewing
","When a Roman general (Russell Crowe) is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son (Joaquin Phoenix), he comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge.The music is very much like that for the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series, which should not be surprising given that both come from Hans Zimmer. Did he recycle the music here for 'Pirates', or is it just a similar style? Hmm.This is the film that really made Russell Crowe an international star, and helped him earn an Oscar (though it probably should have gone to Geoffrey Rush). This is also probably the best film from Ridley Scott since 'Blade Runner'. While on first viewing it may not seem like anything special, it really does present a great telling of Rome and its problems (fictionalized) and could have parallels to empires today.",7,2,5,18 November 2014

She has really gone on to bigger and better things (including 'The Hunger Games') and folks may want to check this out.The cast in general is pretty impressive, and has at least ten faces that we always like to see. Gary Busey? Check. Matthew McConaughey? Check. James Woods? Check.The release of 'Contact' was publicized by controversies from the Clinton administration and CNN, as well as individual lawsuits from George Miller and Francis Ford Coppola. These are all interesting stories in themselves. The White House was not pleased with how footage was used, and can you blame them? It really looks like the speech was intended for this film.",7,0,2,14 April 2015
Donnie Darko," One of the Greatest Films of My Generation
","A troubled teenager (Jake Gyllenhaal) is plagued by visions of a large bunny rabbit that manipulates him to commit a series of crimes, after narrowly escaping a bizarre accident.Having graduated high school in 1999, I was very much a product of the 1990s. And being into the industrial music scene, I saw the 90s as a decade consumed with nihilistic imagery, both with films and music. Friedrich Nietzsche was back in a big way, for better or worse (probably worse, since he is so misunderstood by people).'Donnie Darko' missed the 1990s, but I think many people may age saw it as the film that capped their experience of adolescence. The film is quite nihilistic (in the most uplifting way) and even has James Duval in a minor (but important) role. Duval was well-known to those of us who gravitated to the films of Gregg Araki.Before we had 'Lost', this was the film that sparked amateur philosophy debates. We were not quoting Locke or Descartes, but we were wondering what it all meant, what was the deeper meaning, is time travel really possible... it all seemed so profound. Looking back now (in 2013 at age 32), I cannot help but wonder how much of this was youthful eyes and mind, and how much was really in the film... but I did find myself captivated watching it (yet) again, many years since the days when it was on constant rewind.Richard Kelly was supposed to be the next big thing after this film came out. As near as I can tell, that never happened. 'Southland Tales' never really took off. And then 'The Box'... a film that wants to be deep, but probably is not. Many of the Darko devotees (myself included) wanted there to be something in the story, something beyond the original version, but it all seems so convoluted.Anyway, 'Donnie Darko' remains a classic of modern independent cinema.",8,1,5,18 March 2013
Born on the Fourth of July," Classic Anti-Vietnam Movie That Really Need Not Be Classic
","The story of a man who wanted to be the best... who joined the Marines and lost his legs... only to eventually see that sometimes war is not all honor. Sometimes war is a mistake.Oliver Stone has some obsession with Vietnam, with this movie, 'Platoon' and 'JFK' all focusing on it. This one is easily the weakest of the three. And I must say it sure is brave to make a film standing against the war, fifteen years after it's over. Way to go, Stone.Tom Cruise was nominated for a boatload of awards... and yeah, he has no legs. But his acting was as poor as ever and whoever gave him the mustache did a really poor job making it look real. I was distracted by the mustache, and when I wasn't I still thought Cruise was being a little boy in a grown man's role.The story itself was decent, as it traced a man's journey from being all-American and anti-Communist to a war protester, and was a true story. But it wasn't anything I hadn't heard before. The only new thing was the Mexican prostitutes, who seemed really out of place in this movie. But again, I guess it really happened.I give the film a 7 for effort and spirit, but really I could have gone on with my life never having seen this emotionless crud.",7,0,2,30 October 2006
The Social Network," By Far David Fincher's Best Work
","This film offers what purports to be the true story of Mark Zuckerberg the founding of Facebook. I suspect it is fairly accurate, as it is based on court documents. What may seem like a simple story of geek innovation is also a story of theft, betrayal, and the rise of modern social networking technology.Jesse Eisenberg is amazing as Mark Zuckerberg. How accurate he is (or any of the actors are) I do not know. But his geek genius and social ineptitude are clear, and I think that is spot on. Eisenberg was the right choice for the role, as no other person has the geeky vibe but can be a very serious actor (as well as comedian).Justin Timberlake is also great as Sean Parker. Timberlake does not act often, but when he does, I am often impressed (he was great in 'Black Snake Moan', for example). Maybe being a talkative big shot is not a stretch for him, but he pulls it off, and gives me a whole new perspective on Parker, a man I have somewhat admired. Though, I admire Shawn Fanning much more, and viewers should not confuse the two -- the film does not make this distinction clear. I had no idea he had any involvement in technology beyond Napster (and I find it odd that a geek would be so party-happy, though I guess he worked more on the investment end).Kevin Spacey produced this film, and I love him for it. Spacey is an amazing actor, and I am glad to see him move into the realm of producing, not unlike George Clooney if I am not mistaken. Trent Reznor was also involved on the music end. Fincher has long been a Reznor fan, so I think this is a perfect choice, and Trent nails the score. I am surprised his involvement did not get a bigger notice.David Fincher has been a great director for years. 'Seven' is obviously his masterpiece, and even the troubled 'Alien 3' is decent. 'Zodiac' was a great telling of a classic true crime tale. I think 'Social Network' might be the best yet, though. While 'Seven' is his best overall, it suffers from not being a film everyone would want to watch. This one is more universal and very timely, especially with Zuckerberg being 2010's Man of the Year.If you have not yet caught this one, do so now. I suspect it will get a handful of Oscar nominations, and maybe even a win or two. Fincher's dark visions brought the world of Silicon Valley? Oh, yes!",9,2,4,10 January 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The Indy Trilogy Ends Strong
","When Dr. Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery) suddenly goes missing while pursuing the Holy Grail, eminent archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) must follow in his father's footsteps and stop the Nazis.The general consensus is that 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is the best Indiana Jones film, 'Temple of Doom' was a disappointment, and this one was the redeemer: not as good as 'Raiders' (but close), and better than 'Temple'. Now, in fairness, 'Temple' is probably better than generally given credit, but the overall order is correct.The Nazi villains here are among the nastiest, the plot is weaving in the way that we want from an Indy film... and the object of their search? Well, how can you ever get better than the Holy Grail? (The original script called for the Fountain of Youth... maybe someday we will see that.)",7,0,1,1 December 2014

The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any).

His two partners kill off everyone else involved in the robbery, and slowly start to climb up through the hierarchy of the Mob.I am impressed with how closely the film follows the book, with some lines seemingly coming across exactly. If Pileggi's book is accurate, this film is also accurate. (As an organized crime historian, I can confidently say that Pileggi's book is among the best-written accounts of mob life ever put to paper.) Some say this is Scorsese's best film. I tend to prefer 'Gangs of New York', but this could go either way.",9,0,1,6 August 2013
The Bourne Supremacy," Good Thriller Ruined By Bad Camera
","When Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is framed for a CIA operation gone awry, he is forced to resume his former life as a trained assassin to survive.Paul Greengrass is a mystery to me. He has a nice script, a solid cast, and can make these great spy thrillers. We are now (as of 2015) up to the fifth Bourne movie. But he has this weird obsession with making his camera shake. I could blame the cinematographer, but I think Greengrass likes this. And it makes no sense to me. Even when characters are standing still, talking, the camera wiggles. Why? One thing that makes this a better film than its predecessor is the decreased role for Julia Stiles. No disrespect to Stiles. I loved her in the 1990s with '10 Things' and 'Wicked', but she is not a great actress.",6,1,2,1 December 2015
The Great Gatsby," Luhrmann's Best Work Yet
","A Midwestern war veteran finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor.The reviews on this film seem to be mixed, or maybe even negative. Some people really disliked the musical choices (though I felt them better suited than Luhrmann's 'Moulin Rouge' choices, which varied from great to terrible). Some disliked Tobey McGuire, either for his acting or for the 'lapdog' take on Nick Carraway. That seems more fair.I loved it. While 'Romeo + Juliet' may go down as Luhrmann's masterpiece, this is really quite a trip, with plenty of opulence without ever making that the point. He wanted a love story -- if this can be called that -- and not a morality tale on money, Wall Street, or anything else.There seems a need to compare Jay Gatsby to the 'Wolf of Wall Street' merely because DiCaprio appeared in both films in the same year, and both are excessively wealthy. There is no need for that, because again, it is not about the money. The money was merely a means to an end for Gatsby, not the goal in itself.",8,1,3,17 March 2014
The Birds," Very Enjoyable Hitchcock Classic
","A wealthy San Francisco socialite (Tippi Hedren) pursues a potential boyfriend (Rod Taylor) to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack people there in increasing numbers and with increasing viciousness.I have to say, right off the bat, that the birds were pretty cheesy. It was more than obvious that they were not actually in the same room or area as the people, at least most of the time. And their squawks were like records being played backwards. They were not particularly terrifying.That aside, it was a good movie. Great characters (though the sister is a bit irritating) and some underlying issues that never fully come to a head. Dominant mother? Absent father? A former lover? We have the makings of a good bit of tension here... enough to have a plot outside of the bird attacks.",7,3,5,26 March 2012
Princess Mononoke," Japanese Cartoon Classic
","On a journey to find the cure for a Tatarigami's curse, Ashitaka finds himself in the middle of a war between the forest gods and Tatara, a mining colony. In this quest he also meets San, the Mononoke Hime.While Americans rarely see much for cartoons beyond the world of Walt Disney (or perhaps Don Bluth), we can thank fantasy author Neil Gaiman for getting this Japanese film properly released in the states. Between 'Princess Mononoke' and 'Spirited Away', there is much to be seen in the way of Japanese animation beyond the omnipresent anime.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called Princess Mononoke 'a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year.' He is not alone in that sentiment. Almost twenty years later, the film has not decreased in its critical praise.",7,1,2,4 December 2014
Cinderella Man," Russell Crowe Fighting
","The story of James Braddock (Russell Crowe), a supposedly washed-up boxer who came back to become a champion and an inspiration in the 1930s.What does Russell Crowe do best? Fighting people around the world. Here, he gets to fight people in the 1930s, in Depression-era boxing, before the rise of bigger stars like Joe Louis (who would beat Braddock). When you think fighting, you think Crowe.At the time, this was probably a great film, but it already seems overshadowed by other boxing movies. Today (2015), you think 'The Fighter' or 'Million Dollar Baby', but you do not think 'Cinderella Man'. If you make a list of classic boxing movies (besides the Rocky films), this one may or may not make the list. Ron Howard is a great director and Paul Giamatti is a great actor, but this one simply does not stand the test of time.",6,0,2,13 January 2015
Jurassic Park," Amazing and Iconic
","During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.This film was released over twenty years ago (I write this in January 2014) and still remains iconic and embedded in the consciousness of the American movie-goer. The attorney on the toilet, the cartoon DNA molecule, and Jeff Goldblum's career-defining role (even more so than 'The Fly')...I need to see this movie again to really get a handle on it critically, but how do you say anything bad about this picture? Special effects and CGI today cannot compete with what they had then... how have we gone backwards?",8,2,6,6 January 2014
Beetlejuice," Tim Burton's Career When It Was About Peaked
","The Maitlands (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are a happy young couple in a big house, redecorating to their hearts' content while another relative insists that they sell. After a minor car accident, both of them drown and the house is sold... but unfortunately the couple still 'lives' on inside the home alongside the annoying new family. How can they scare the newcomers away? I watched this film on Halloween 2007 for two reasons -- first, because you need to watch scary movies on Halloween (although I think this is really more of a comedy). But second, because Robert Goulet had passed on a few days before, and I felt it would only be right and proper to honor the man who had made such an impression in my life after seeing him sing live in 2002.As far as I know, this film marks the first Tim Burton and Michael Keaton collaboration, before they both went on to make the two best Batman films in history (at least until Chris Nolan came around). We also have Jeffrey Jones, another regular and the music by Danny Elfman from Oingo Boingo. Winona Ryder (from Burton's 'Edward Scissorhands') is here, and this is by far her greatest role. Maybe her only truly great role, in fact, as this is the way I like to remember her... not so much as Spock's mother.Tim Burton was perfect to direct this film, giving him a range of weird and grotesque things to work with, weird clay stuff and wild architecture. It's like the peak of his career because it's as strange as 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure' and as dark as any of his films... all of which were perfect until he picked 'Planet of the Apes' and his career died a brutal death (with the post-Apes exception of 'Big Fish' and perhaps 'Big Eyes').That is what you get here, though: comedy and the macabre, mixed together... a world where suicide victims get to spend the afterlife as civil servants... and your death wound stays visible forever. (Drowning seems to have been a good choice to avoid looking awful.) Michael Keaton at his dirtiest (think 'Night Shift' and not 'Mr. Mom'). Oh, and Harry Belafonte's 'Banana Boat Song'... you need that.So, should you see it? The real question is why haven't you already? Any horror fan will appreciate this, as will any Tim Burton fan. The feel of this film is fun and fresh even two decades later. There is a special edition 20th anniversary DVD, which also offers a few episodes of the cartoon for some reason. It isn't great... maybe next time?",9,1,2,11 November 2007
All the President's Men," Politics In A Digestible, Enjoyable Format
","'All the President's Men' is the true story of how the Washington Post uncovered the Watergate scandal and traced it all the way to its conclusion: that the perpetrator behind it all was President Richard Nixon.The way this story was told is perfect: we don't see the story as it actually unfolds, but in the way that Woodward and Bernstein tracked it down. This makes it not only history, but a mystery. If you didn't already know how it turns out, you could follow along and try to see whodunit. Robert Redford is a delightful and handsome lead, and Dustin Hoffman has never been a poor actor.How much the actors really look like their characters is debatable, but not really important to the story. Scandal exists every day, but not every day is it discovered: this was the big one, and an inspiration for journalists worldwide.",9,2,3,15 April 2010
The Wizard of Oz," An Essential Film in American History
","Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is swept away to a magical land in a tornado and embarks on a quest to see the Wizard (Frank Morgan) who can help her return home.I should probably give the film a 10, but I always find it hard to give anything 100%, because surely it could always be better in some way. Right? But 'Wizard of Oz' is about as perfect as films get, with such a memorable plot and songs that it has inspired children (and adults) for 80 years. Now, with the 'Wicked' books (and musical), it seems relevant again, even if those books are not canon.What I find interesting is how simple some of the film is. The sets are very much stage sets and make no serious attempt at being 'real'. But they don't need to be. On the other hand, the makeup is amazing, the costumes beyond compare... and the flying monkeys are almost too lifelike!",9,3,4,7 September 2016
Dodgeball," One of the Best Comedies of the Last Decade
","A local gym is going under, largely because the owner refuses to collect fees from his clients. But when a larger rival gym threatens to take him over, it becomes personal... and unorthodox methods of raising money are used. The one decided on: dodgeball.Who is Rawson Marshall Thurber? That is the real question here. You have probably never heard of him, and other than 'Dodgeball' his projects are not well known. Yet, he wrote and directed this film -- flawlessly -- and cast some of the best actors in the business. Plenty of big names here, and some great character actors. How did he do that?I have no idea. But what I do know is that this film is genuinely hilarious. The jokes are well-written, and well-delivered by the cast. Some of the best parts come from the cameos of some pop culture icons, and Jason Bateman's sports commentator role, Pepper Brooks, is his best role to date (even better than 'Arrested Development'). This is a must-see film for all fans of comedy.",9,1,3,13 August 2010
Rock Star," The Story of Journey?
","Lead singer of a tribute band (Marky Mark) becomes lead singer of the real band he idolizes.So, I see comments saying this is another movie Jennifer Aniston ruined. Well, that is half true. She definitely makes it worse and every scene she is in amounts to a steaming pile of doo. Even her voice is grating and it is hard to take her seriously.But the movie would have stunk either way. It has a good idea, sort of, especially since this really happened (to Journey). But it is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious enough to be a drama. It just sort of... is. It would have been significantly better if it had a little more humor in it and could have been passed off as a mockumentary. I mean, yeah, we already have 'Spinal Tap', but it wouldn't have to be that silly.",5,0,0,18 January 2016
The Martian," Quite Possibly the Best of 2015
","During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.Although at this point I have only seen three of the eight Best Picture nominees, I feel confident in saying that 'The Martian' deserves to win. Although Ridley Scott is not nominated for Best Director (odd considering this is his best film in a long time or possibly ever), and the only acting nomination is for Matt Damon (who will likely lose to Leonardo DiCaprio)... this movie nails it on the story alone.By all means, this can win in the Best Adapted Screenplay category, as well. No, I have not read the original book so I do not know what Drew Goddard put into it. And no, I have not seen all the other nominees yet. I suspect 'Big Short' is also an excellent script. But again, this film succeeds based on two things: incredible suspense and a strong script. Is all the science strictly accurate? No. Apparently some key things, such as the 'fierce storm', are not correct. But we believe it. Everyone speaks as though they know what they say, and unlike 'Star Wars' (or even 'Star Trek') this is clearly based on reality.In recent years, it seems that a space movie somehow sneaks into the top Academy nominees. After 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar', we have this. And I dare say they are getting better. 'Gravity' was a good exploration of visuals, but not a deep film. 'Interstellar' took everything to the next level, even to the point of being a mind-bender. Here, I think we have the perfect balance: hard science and space danger. What could have been two hours of boring, bland scenes of a man in a desert end up being exciting and you can feel the desperation -- and more importantly the endless optimism and hope.The bulk of the film's nominations are in production design, sound and other effects. These are well-deserved, and it may take home a few. Not being an expert, it is hard to judge sound editing. But this is the sort of movie where such a thing can make or break the picture. There will be some strong competition, but the designs of the NASA equipment are impressive and the sounds are excellent. The visual effects are a harder sell, with some of the low-gravity moments seeming a bit off somehow.The takeaway: expect a win or two in the technical categories. Of the bigger awards, Damon is a contender for Best Actor but will not win. Best Adapted Screenplay ought to be a lock, and if it gets nothing else this is the film's strong suit. For my money, 'The Martian' has Best Picture written all over it, but the experts are leaning more towards 'The Revenant' or 'Spotlight'... on that, we will have to agree to disagree.",9,4,9,17 January 2016
The Fighter," A Solid Film, Better Than I Expected
","While many are calling this film a 'winner' and positioning it for best picture of 2010, I just do not see that. Yes, it is quite good and even better than I expected for a film that is basically the same old underdog rises up story.Mark Wahlberg (who looks like Matt Damon) is a decent actor, but it is Christian Bale that steals the show here. Fragile, a little bit crazy, he is not even recognizable as the man who plays Batman. Few if any actors today put as much effort into becoming their roles than Bale does, and he is the reason to watch this film -- without him it would just be average.Expect this to get Bale a nomination and probably a win for supporting actor... beyond that, I do not see it.",7,1,1,23 January 2011
Evil Dead II," Possibly the Best in the Genre
","After making the mistake of going to a cabin in the woods in 'Evil Dead', Ash Williams returns to the same cabin in the woods for 'Evil Dead II' (although there is dispute whether this should be considered a sequel or a remake). When the evil dead are awakened by the incantations from the Necronomicon, only Ash has the sheer audacity to try and stop them from taking over the world. This film does not have the best special effects ever, relying heavily on stop-motion animation and odd camera angles. The acting is more than a little campy. The plot is thin, particularly since it is a rehash of the first film. The action is a little bit silly. And for a horror film, it has virtually no swearing or nudity and much of the blood is not even red.But still, a great many people consider this the greatest horror film of all time (with all due respect to 'Jaws') and I consider it easily in the top ten of horror films (Internet Movie Database ranks it 45th). Even Roger Ebert, notorious anti-horror, gives it three out of four stars. And here is why.This film shows what can be achieved with little money and a big imagination. Backwards filming, stop-motion animation, puppetry. Modern directors would rather use computers than rely on trick shots, but this film shows that costumes and Jell-O can go a long way. I am so sick of 'scary movies' that try to scare me with some futuristic cartoon. Why not give me blood, gore and have fun while doing it? Could any film have been more fun than this? The plot: a man and his girlfriend stay in a cabin and unleash the spirits of evil which can only be stopped with a careful reading of an ancient book. The same exact plot as 'Evil Dead', this is basically a remake with a bigger budget with an injection of slapstick comedy and the removal of a crucial rape scene. (I understand why the rape scene was removed, but this was the most memorable part of the first film and it is strange they would neuter their bigger film.)Sometimes the camera shots go too far. Sam Raimi likes some strange angles (see 'Intruder') and he likes to use the zoom button on some weird objects a few too many times (though this gag is taken even further in 'Army of Darkness'). The first twenty minutes has by far the most strange camera shots you will see in almost any film, and more than in the rest of the movie combined. People new to the film might find this overbearing. Heck, even I do not completely get it.What works here is that we have all the Raimi regulars, who offer that perfect chemistry. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who are rarely far apart, offer some of the finest films in the past few decades. But do not forget co-writer Scott Spiegel, who also wrote 'Intruder' and is a long-time Raimi associate (and played a great wandering minstrel for '2001 Maniacs'). Ted Raimi, Sam's brother, is a must for any good Raimi film (although his solo work, like 'Skinner', is sometimes lacking).And do not ever count out Danny Hicks, the redneck trouble-maker in this film ('Jake'). He has been with them for 'Intruder', 'Maniac Cop', '2001 Maniacs', 'Darkman' and the upcoming 'My Name is Bruce'. Hicks is probably the most unsung of the troupe, and hardly deserves that backseat reputation. Hicks met Raimi on this film and has been with him ever since, and I can speak from personal experience when I say he goes out of his way to promote love for the horror genre.When it comes down to brass tacks, this group works because the point here is to have fun... and because that is what horror is to me, fun. Fun with chainsaws. And if horror is fun, this film is one of the best horror films the world has to offer. How that ends up getting a guy the 'Spider-Man' franchise is beyond me. But as the tagline says: 'Kiss Your Nerves Goodbye', and also your worries, too, if you need a good laugh.",9,2,6,26 July 2006
High Fidelity," John Cusack's Defining Role, Post-1980s
","Rob Gordon (John Cusack), a record store owner and compulsive list maker, recounts his top five breakups, including the one in progress.Top five things that are great about this movie: Five, Tim Robbins' hair. Four, Jack Black. Three, Stiff Little Fingers. Two, John Cusack giving the best performance of his career, or at least since 'Say Anything'. One, the conversation about 'Evil Dead II' and the word 'yet'. Honorable mention, Lisa Bonet not being completely annoying and almost actually likable.Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, 'Watching High Fidelity, I had the feeling I could walk out of the theater and meet the same people on the street â and want to, which is an even higher compliment'.",8,7,9,6 March 2015
Up in the Air," Well Made, But Just Rather Blah
","With a job that has him traveling around the country firing people, Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) leads an empty life out of a suitcase, until his company does the unexpected: ground him.On a technical level, the film is well made. It looks good, the script is decent, and any film with George Clooney has to be at least mostly good. He is one of the great actors of our time. And the 'twist' was predictable yet redeeming to such a standard romance. Heck, I even appreciated the political message of what it is like to be unemployed.But I found the mix of comedy and drama to fail, especially because the drama was so boring compared with the comedy. The balance was off. A few good moments -- with Sam Elliott and Young MC -- did not make up for the lazy romance, Anna Kendrick's atrocious acting, or the awful soundtrack.I still have to give it a good rating because, heck, it is still a good movie. But so much was unbalanced, and it would probably have worked best as a straight comedy.",7,1,1,12 November 2012
From Here to Eternity," A Fine Showcase for Montgomery Clift
","In 1941 Hawaii, a private is cruelly punished for not boxing on his unit's team, while his captain's wife and second in command are falling in love.This film is all Clift, and his homosexuality. Clift's character refuses to fight, is accused of being a 'lone wolf'... his lack of manliness is evident. This is again a curiosity when Sinatra asks Clift, 'do you have any prejudices against girls'? Clift's sexy bugle playing is very homoerotic with the way he thrusts his hips at the other men. Harry Cohn resisted the idea of casting Montgomery Clift as Prewitt as 'he was no soldier, no boxer and probably a homosexual'. Fred Zinnemann refused to make the film without him. And now we have this classic story of a gay man at Pearl Harbor.I love the emotions during the iconic beach scene, which fluctuates between romantic and antagonistic, vacillating between playfully suggesting a woman is a man-eater and outright calling her a floozy.",8,1,5,6 April 2011
Atonement," An English Tale of Love and Redemption
","In 1930s England, Robbie is the son of a cleaning woman who has fallen in love with his mother's master's daughter (his childhood friend). On the same night where they reveal their love to each other, Robbie is accused by the woman's younger sister of a rape he didn't commit. Robbie is sent to jail and off to fight World War II... and for the remainder of the film, the two lovers try to reunite while the younger sister comes to term with the horrible mistake she made that tore her family apart.Let me be honest up front: I had a very minimal interest in this film. I was mildly interested by its Oscar aspirations (7 nominations) and then I was slightly more interested when my friend Chelsea expressed interest (with whom I ended up seeing it). A chick flick starring Keira Knightley (who, to me, is a younger, classier Winona Ryder)? Not my first choice. Although, I went to go see 'I Know Who Killed Me', so my instincts aren't always he greatest. Anyway, point being -- I saw this film half-heartedly and really liked it.The beginning is really strong and interesting, and surprisingly funny. The involvement of a certain curse word (one of the more notorious ones) plays a big part and was funny in a somewhat awkward way. After the opening, the tone of the film turned decidedly darker... which you'd expect with a film about war and rape, I guess. Emotionally the film runs strong all the way through, working with loneliness and casualties of war (there's a scene later on with a dying French soldier that doesn't shy from showing the realities of war).Worth singling out is a very long continuous shot (maybe 8 or 9 minutes) of English troops on the shores of France. We see troops singing, troops destroying jeeps, troops shooting horses and much more... to get this all in one shot is a major feat. The last long shot I recall is in 'Children of Men', which ran about maybe 6 minutes but with much less going on to coordinate. The choreographer (or whoever) deserved the Oscar if anyone did, although in the end it only won a single award -- for best original soundtrack (which I don't recall as being a particularly stand-out score).I think the film closed rather weakly after all the quality emotion (I can't really explain more without revealing things). But it's still a good film, only maybe losing a point from this closing. If you're a fan of period pieces or tough romance stories (this is no romantic comedy) this is for you. I don't know if I could watch it again -- it's good enough but a bit emotional. But I'm glad I saw it at least once and you should see it too.",7,2,5,27 February 2008
V for Vendetta," One of Those Rare Films to Really Earn a 10
","In the future, England is controlled by a fascist, 1984-esque government. One man, who calls himself V, has taken on the guise of Guy Fawkes and has made it his personal mission to destroy Parliament and get England to rise up. He befriends Evey (Natalie Portman), who sometimes sees his side and sometimes doesn't.I've given out a handful of 10s. I think out of the nearly 500 reviews I've done, I've given out maybe 7 or 8 of them. I'm not quick to throw a 10 on something because of some whim, you really have to earn it. This film earns it in spades.Natalie Portman is the perfect actress: obviously beautiful, but also a real actress. Some of the other casting considerations (such as Scarlett Johannsen) I just don't have as much confidence in. And Hugo Weaving, although never seen on the screen (at least not his face), made a great V. It makes me sad that Alan Moore decided to preemptively disown this film, because unlike 'League of Extraordinary Gentleman', this is a winner. (And I liked 'From Hell', even if Moore didn't.) I'm a little partial to this film. I love the musical themes, the alliteration. I love the anti-government, pro-populace message. I do own the graphic novel. But underneath all that, this film offers it all.There's romance (and I mean actual romance, not just people screwing around on a gaming table). There's action, fighting and explosions. There's intense drama (I cried a few times, especially during the prison sequences). I suppose the humor might be lacking, but I hadn't really noticed because everything else is done in just the right amounts.If you like Portman, like good dramas and action films, and are willing to suspend your disbelief for two hours (there are some things that might be just a small stretch of impossibility) this is a must-see. Already firmly planted on the Internet Movie Database's Top 250, I have no doubt it will stay there for a great many years.",10,5,10,20 May 2007
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," One of the Best, No Question
","In the deep south during the 1930s, three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while a relentless lawman pursues them.Saying this is the Coen Brothers' greatest film would be hard, as so many of their movies are among the greatest made in the last few decades. Does this surpass 'Fargo' or 'The Big Lebowski'? Some would say yes, but how do you decide that? 'Lebowski' is one of the biggest cult films of its generation.What is great about this film is... well, everything. Solid acting, beautiful cinematography (particularly the sepia tones) and a great adaptation of the work of Homer. Classic literature does not always come across as fresh to modern generations. In this incarnation, it certainly does. A special nod must go to Tim Blake Nelson. Although not as big of a name as George Clooney or John Turturro, he is an equal part of this comedy trio.",9,0,1,20 February 2015
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," I Hate To Admit It, But I Liked This One
","Ricky Bobby grows up to become a big-time race car driver. With the conflict of having no father to raise him, life was not always easy. And now, as an adult, he is finally ready to meet his match: a French driver from the Formula Un series. Can Ricky make him surrender? Shake and bake! I really don't want to like this film, because I think Will Ferrell is past his prime already and on his way out. The bigger a role he receives, the less likely he is to make a good movie, because he is just such a dumb actor. Popping in for a brief time ('Wedding Crashers') is alright, but a full movie ('Elf')? I don't know. Yet, he took the whole film here and ran with it.The help came from John C. Reilly, who was fantastic as Cal Naughton, Jr. While he is not the usual co-star of Ferrell (such as Vince Vaughn, or one of the Wilson brothers) he was a dominant force. Seeing some new faces was very good, although having 'Crash' from 'Anchorman' was a nice touch, as I would consider 'Anchorman' to be Ferrell's best film.Stealing the show was Sacha Baron Cohen as Jean Girard. I did not even recognize him until the movie was almost over. Cohen is a master of disguise ('Alig G', 'Borat', 'Bruno') and I would say this was his best performance yet. All the French references were great (Albert Camus, Perrier, crepes) and this character was so much more than just a simple parody of French culture. Why he was hanging out with Elvis Costello and Mos Def is unknown to me.This film has the comedy that other films by these creators have, with constant pop culture references that pay off if you get it. And heck, if you don't, there's a good amount of really stupid humor, too (such as the imaginary fire). My favorite scene might be where they try to figure out how to pry out a knife from a man's leg.If you want a cheese fountain at your wedding with nachos and seven different kinds of cheese, you need to see this movie.",8,29,45,17 December 2006
The Godfather," Greatest Movie in World History? Maybe. Maybe Not.
","The people who vote on the Internet Movie Database have ranked 'The Godfather' as the greatest film ever in human history. Which is nothing to sneeze at, and deserves some seriously thought. I watched the film, thought it was great, but hardly found it to be the greatest film ever made. I mean, if you told me 'Citizen Kane' was the greatest film ever made, I would wholeheartedly agree. And personally, as far as gangster movies go -- with or without Al Pacino -- I think the real choice should be 'Scarface'. But I'm not professionally trained as a movie critic, so maybe I'm missing something.I asked my supervisor and a co-worker about the film, and while they both thought the film was good, they really did not think it was some amazing masterpiece. My supervisor said, 'maybe it's good because it is so real', but that's not a convincing reason and how 'real' it is I cannot say for sure.If nothing else, the film might be great simply because it has become so clichÃ©. The horse head, the Marlon Brando voice, the gun behind the toilet and the line 'an offer he can't refuse' are all part of pop culture these days (over 30 years later). But does being clichÃ© make the film great? I guess that would make 'Star Wars' the greatest film ever made, which is certainly not true (though not a bad film by any means).And sure, you have powerful and memorable performances. James Caan is amazing, Marlon Brando is a bit over-the-top (a mumbling, lock-jawed godfather? sure...). And Al Pacino is of course great as always, maybe more so here than anywhere else. Not only does he have more range here than any other film than 'Scent of a Woman' (more often than not he simply repeats a variation of his Michael Corleone role), but he is so young and plain that he is not even recognizable as Al Pacino in many scenes (I didn't recognize him until 30 minutes into the picture).I haven't yet mentioned the plot: an aging mafia boss (Marlon Brando) hands control over to his son (Al Pacino) when the father becomes ill, though he hoped never to do so since his son is Ivy League educated. Brando's role is actually quite small compared to the attention he is given (the film is really about Pacino coming of age).The directing is decent. Nothing special, but not awful, either. Very real and almost gritty (but not dark). The acting is great. The music is perfect. The only thing that really needed work was the fact that many of the Italian scenes had no subtitles and were thus lost in (lack of) translation. The entire Sciliy subplot and Appollonia were excellent and could not have been improved upon.I'm sure much more could have been said, but I'll cut myself off here. Certainly looking forward to Part II (though keeping my hopes and expectations low) and maybe someday I'll see Part III (though I've been warned not to).",8,4,10,17 August 2006
