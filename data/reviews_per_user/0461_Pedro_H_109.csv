Saturday Night Fever," Classic moments but mostly rancid and dumb
","Tony is a NY roughneck with a low IQ and a job in a paint store, but manages to find relief and recognition through his Saturday night disco dancing.One of the real curiosities of modern cinema, this bit of guff-among-the-grunts spawned one of the world's biggest albums and a whole disco industry; but at  the same time is clearly a thrown together script based on a short article published in a little read newspaper.(You can read it in full as part of the rock and pop anthology 'The Faber Book of Pop' - a highly recommended read if you can find it.)I can't think of any film in which the message and style of the music contrasts more with what appears in visual form. Thank god the Bee Gee's wrote the music in glorious isolation to the crass, dark and ugly images.Here we have death, gang rape, homophobia (thrown in twice in case you went to the bathroom the first time around), racism, violence and family conflict. Like a checklist from the cheap thrills section of the Bumper Book of Teen Movie Clichés. Yes these things exist in real life, but surely we need a point to go along with them? So much that happens here has no consequence or knock-on effect, beyond things like a token cop scribbling on his notepad before tipping his hat.Take away the music and the dancing (which are sadly brief) and what you have is two hours trapped with foul-mouthed morons who spit out their food as they talk (boy has that John T actually swallowed a few burgers since those days!) and walk on the tables to leave.SNF is one of those movies that would be better if no one saw it as a whole, but only saw via those brief clips we see on TV  - especially those played out against the Bee Gee's better work.Yes Travolta can dance and is a bit double jointed, but he isn't that good. He doesn't even really win the contest down at the 2001 Disco. Let's not get too carried away here, he is still only a talented amateur impressing the locals who don't know any better.If you watch it on video you should  at least keep your finger on the fast forward and rewind button. You'll need it...",5,1,3,5 December 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Pertinacious junk - the most expensive B movie ever made.
","A former key member of a comic book ' assassination squad' (Uma Thurnan) is almost killed on her wedding day and continues (from Part 1) her quest to get her own back on the her would-be killers.(Will she succeed? Oh, the tension, the tension.) Since Pulp Fiction every movie that Quentin Tarantino has made is worse than the last. This, at least, keeps up his record. Maybe we will realise that he is, really, a one/two trick pony - although that is not to say that some people won't be entertained by the limited tricks until the day they die.Most adults have to go to work so they don't have all day to read comic books, watch bad movies and read third rate pulp fiction (small case). Q (as he is sometimes billed) only rarely rises from his chair to work -- although I am sure he classes a 1,000 interviews (in which he often refers to the praise of others!) as work -- so he has plenty of time to do the above. The result is the kind of film we see here. Tired clichés and po faced speeches that we are supposed to take seriously.(Or are tired clichés and 'bad' reborn as irony?) Those that got-off on the senseless violence of Part 1 will be surprised by the restraint of Part 2. While it retains the back of the cigarette packet plot it does have moments of humour and irony -- although the script is not half as clever as it thinks it is.They say that the Beatles audience was more interesting that the group -- fans of this film are more interesting than the film. Everyone can see something different in the mist. Feel free to like and dislike -- but this has a silly IMDb score...",4,3,7,11 February 2006
Scarface," Pretty average rise-and-fall gangster pic that was unfairly savaged at the time.
","A Cuban immigrant with a suspect past comes to America as part of a general clean out (by Castro) of social and political troublemakers.Interesting that this movie seemed to get a lot of people (pro critics especially) reaching for their poison pens. Maybe the fact that this was a remake of a well regarded movie that got them reaching for the special ink bottle or maybe because it told a lot of truths about America's drug saturation at that point in history? Whatever the facts the movie seemed to be singled out for special treatment which was unfair. While this is not a great movie, it is quite entertaining and is believable in outline form - if not technical detail.(No killer would open up a machine gun in a night-club when then they could lie in wait outside, for example.)I have never taken cocaine and intend never to do so. It is - for me - the ultimate masturbation drug: Stick it up your nose and then march around feeling great about yourself for twenty minutes before reality starts poking its ugly nose in again after which you repeat the cycle. Al Pacino's past and past associations make him ideal for playing criminals because he knows them. I am not suggesting that he was one though. He is well placed for this lead  role - which I understand is his favourite film role.The problem with this piece is that it seems happy to play by TV series/movies rules. Make sure you sprinkle in a bit of sex/violence/shock every twenty minutes throughout the piece because otherwise the audience will switch off. While hardly new - or explored in depth - this does raise the paradox of the criminal world: You have to deal with fellow criminals, but they always want to take your place if you are higher up the food chain!This is a movie that comes pretty much as expected. Indeed if I was to have formed a checklist of content before seeing it I would have put a line throughout most of the list as the titles rolled. It is - however - pretty gory at times and there is a scene with a chain saw that must be one of the most unpleasant pieces of business I have ever seen. Truly revolting.
Director De Palma always reminds me of the boxer who keeps getting world title fights and never quite becomes the champion. After a while you have to conclude it isn't all bad luck or bad timing - he just isn't good enough to go all the way!",7,1,2,14 May 2004
Love and Death," Funny sets pieces - but rather thrown together.
","Woody plays a condemned man who, despite being a coward, has played a major role in the Napoleonic wars. His tale is told in flashback as he waits to be 'saved' by forces unknown. Diane Keaton plays his reluctant love interest.Early vintage WA that bites off a lot and manages to chew most it, maybe with a bit of light choking here and there!Clearly a satire on War and Peace and heavyweight Russian novels generally, it actually has high production values and even exciting battle scenes (the Polish army working on the cheap). After this Allen vowed never to work outside of New York City again - something he has kept to!For the benefit of newcomers, this is the anything-for-a-laugh Woodie that aimed at the mainstream audience. The screaming black sergeant (pre An Officer and a Gentleman!) is my favourite (Officer {Screaming}: 'You love the army don't you solider? You want to make the army your career, don't you soldier?' Allen {Laconic}: 'Hey, hey, let's not get carried away!') and even throws in a few moments of slapstick with Napoleon himself.Easy laughs about easy targets it may be (and what little that is left can be cribbed from Bob Hope) but a very enjoyable movie. While far too hastily arranged and edited to be anything more than a time filler, it still delivers a plot and laughs - and is, moreover, the kind of film the general cinema audience would like to see Allen making today!",8,1,2,27 April 2003
Requiem for a Dream," Old fashioned morality play reworked for the hip-hop generation.
","Four loosely connected people get caught up in the world of prescribed and illegal drugs.Pretend this is a school project. Write a first draft of a screen play about the subject and where it all leads. Just kidding, just pretend you have. Then go to this movie and tick the boxes: Yes it is fun, fast and making life better in the early days, but in the end it is just downward spiral towards despair, degradation and serious illness.Given the story is just one giant cliché (in capital letters), the question is how well and how originally the cliché is played out. I have to say pretty well. If you enjoy hip-hop and fast cutting. Some real low budget style from Darren Aronosky. Keeps it moving along at a steady clip.Yes, the budget is pretty low and the actors a little bit too good looking (Jared Leno is the only junkie I have seen with a six pack), but this is for the MTV generation. Bad/good messages have to a bit of boom-boom-boom in the background or the audience will fall asleep.Oscar people love over-the-top (look at the rewards for Deniro and Nicolson) and Ellen Burstyn makes it to the red carpet by going completely and utterly bonkers. So bonkers that you ask, how could she have got on a subway train? Found a building? And what happens to her after makes no sense either. They don't force feed people/shock people like that in hospitals - that went out decades ago! The script is as mad and over-the-top as her fantasy world.I don't take drugs. Not from a moral or legal point of view, only that I have never viewed self poisoning as a way of making my life better. If coke was on offer at the local petrol station I wouldn't touch it. Some people do, that is their knee-jerk. I am not better than these people, only different. Who connects with this story (and some must look at the IMDb rating!), it must be people who think, 'drugs have a place and can help.' As I said before, maybe they can for a while. The popularity of the film is a clear indication that people need - still - reminding about what they are really doing and where it can lead. Requiem is a small failure in that it doesn't seek to highlight lives that were going anywhere or leading to anything anyway. If you prostitute yourself you are obviously capable of prostituting yourself. Despite being movie cliché and law - some people don't prostitute themselves even when starving. However they never get their lives portrayed on film. And sex is always exploitation in film - even when it is pretending not to be...",7,0,0,25 March 2009
The Sound of Music," The best ever musical about an Austrian folk singing nun
","A spirited nun leaves her convent and becomes a governess in pre-war Austria. Here she teaches the six children about love, life and music against the growing threat of Nazism.Your fingers hesitate on the keyboard before making comment on a film that is more a phenomena than a stretch of celluloid. This wasn't just a smash hit in the normal western markets - it also went huge everywhere and has stayed huge. The whole Indian film industry is descended from the template set down here.While this was a well regarded stage musical, this wasn't seen as a natural box office smash (a musical based on the life of a nun!) and was probably thrown to Robert Wise (more an action - than a music - man) because he was known for being able to operate well on a budget (all those B pics!)It was just as well, production was hellish: They had forgotten (didn't know?) how moody the European weather could be (even in Summer) and the genuine Austrian period folk songs didn't shine (new ones were quickly written); and beyond that many of the children had no real film acting experience.The success of the film is nothing but a bag of paradoxes, the must striking being that is was old fashioned even when it was released. Beat based pop music was dominating the sales charts and the sixties were beginning to swing. Hem lines were going up hair lines were going down and James Bond had already introduced casual sex and violence to the screen.This may have been made in 1965 - but it could easily have been made 20 years earlier and is the (off-screen) product of people that probably were coming to the end of their best creative period. Oscar and Hammerstein had already penned most of their famous musicals and must have been amazed that they struck their largest gold reserve so late in the day.As Noel Coward once observed, the one thing that critics overlook is that the public are looking for simple minded entertainment, not messages or meaning. And this is both simple minded and entertaining (if you can live with heavy schmaltz). There are certainly no messages, unless you need to be told that love and music are good and Nazi take-overs are bad!The songs don't so much act as light relief, but provide the film with a life support machine. As drama the whole thing can't get out of second gear - even the Nazi threat doesn't raise the drama level beyond village theatre. I also guess we are supposed to know what these people really represent from other sources?Julie Andrews performance is massively underrated. Here is someone that has to sing, dance and act with children (sometimes all at the same time!) and yet makes it look easy, natural and spontaneous. When has, say, Robert De Niro ever done anything as technically difficult as this?In many ways SOM is bullet proof (can you imagine Mel Brooks/Jerry Zucker doing a spoof?) family entertainment. A plot everyone can follow, charming children, excellent score, pretty scenery, perfect lead and a happy ending - if not for the rest of war torn Europe!As a footnote. Twentieth Century Fox lost all the profits they made on this film on musical follow ups that included Hello Dolly, Star and Dr Dolittle - which makes clear that the whole thing was, indeed, just a giant happy accident and musicals were not what the audience secretly wanted all along.",8,19,41,13 May 2003
Ali," Light punching bio-pic with a struggling lead
","The life of Mohammed Ali has been told so many times that only the story of Jesus and the Beatles have been told more. Despite this, the workman like TV director Michael Mannn thinks we should have another jog through it with Will Smith playing the world class boxer and braggart.The problem isn't that Smith doesn't look like Ali, he does a bit, only he looks more like a middleweight than a heavy: and besides, he is clearly far too old to be the young Ali (or should I say Clay?) - but I may be getting picky. In truth nobody could play the role and be believable, Ali was too unique.Journalists tend to make excuses for Ali the man because he made their jobs easy, but the problem is that Ali - the man not the myth - wasn't really any angel. His search for religion doesn't bare scrutiny because he never allowed anything to interfere with his life of doing anything he wanted anytime he felt like it. He wanted to enjoy the protection and wealth of his country, but didn't want to join the army - even though he was hardly going to be put on the front line.(Many countries have conscription and although Vietnam was raging what is there is praise about his behaviour? Instead of being in a barracks he was in hotel rooms with room service and floozies. Political or religious stand my foot - he knew the army would be a world where someone told him what to do and that has never been Ali.)Apologist always says that his public persona was a sham, but his mouth was ranker than the average sewer not caring much whether what came out of it was accurate or not. His pillory of Joe Frazier (who he never really overcame despite having three fights with him) was nothing more than racism. No white person could have got away with calling a black man a 'gorilla.' Even his charity could be put down to stupidity, most of the people that got his money could have gone out to do jobs other than bag carrying or towel straightening.Mann has got in to the grove of new film making by pretending to be a documentary. The wobbly camera making the thing 'more real.' It also allows for angles to hide the stars unconvincing frame. Strangely Smith doesn't know what to do with the private man, other than to look a bit shame faced when confronted by his lack of faithfulness or plain stupidity. The world has never been able to differentiate between people that talk a lot and people that talk a lot of sense. Not to say Ali couldn't, occasionally, be funny or insightful.A lot of this movie doesn't gel, it wants to play Ali as the underdog, but he was not the under dog, but the champion. Even when he wasn't he was paid like he was. He wasn't cheated (unlike so many), he was well paid thanks to a ring of good people. For the record most of them were white; but that doesn't fit the story or the film.We learn nothing about Ali from this film and for long stretches we are barely entertained. We have seen the real fights and know the outcome, drama without suspense cannot be real drama. Many American heroes (Brando, Elvis and Lucas, for example) get fat, lazy and lose the plot; but this film at least knows that it is best to quit before this happens. If only the real Ali had...",6,2,5,22 July 2003
Catch Me If You Can," Lots of old pros telling an amazing story - yet plays like a TV movie!
","A young man with a sharp brain and the face of someone much older takes the fast track to riches by way of wholesale cheque fraud.I know of only one or two scripts that have been going the rounds longer before being actually made. Caligula - the troubled Roman epic - is probably the one you have heard of. You can see why the original book (which shares the movie title) was hot-to-trot. The studio execs must have viewed it as a sure-fire winner that no one could really go wrong with. The only problem being the lack of talent waiting to take on this fish-in-a-barrel project. Maybe some projects are a little too obvious - Cleopatra anyone?Spielberg didn't really want to direct this one and through politics to complicated to go in to here had to switch from producer to director. His heart is not in it - so he just goes for the plod-plod-plod movie-by-numbers approach. Sad to see him not really extending his wonderful cineast brain.I read up heavily on the true life case of Frank Abigale Jnr and even read the press library interviews that he made after seeing the film. His escape from a plane showed that he was a true life James Bond! I always say: Knowledge is power!While the script was true in all its main facts it exaggerates the state of the French prison - that while tough it was not as tough as this. Although it was no holiday camp either. It also skims over how he got to practise law - the reason given here is a classic of stating selective truths.(He flunked the exam several times and was allowed to view his mistakes. There may have been bribery involved as well.)Tom Hanks and DiCaprio play off each other well, but they don't really have a lot to do with each other. The phone calls are a fabrication. They are really working in their own little bubble that only collide every now and then.What is the moral here? That if you say your name is Joe Blow and you are an airline pilot people believe you. That if you put as much effort in to crime as you do in to a real job it can pay better? Life has moved on since those days. CCTV, computers, the Internet, you wouldn't last five minutes doing all this today.The saddest thing is that despite his wealth Frank never looks happy. Not here anyway.Money doesn't make you happy seems the closing moral - but a look around the set of this film would quickly show that to be a lie.",6,3,8,2 November 2004
Spartacus," Good entertainment that dispatches drama, politics and action in equal measure.
","The tale of a Roman man born in to slavery like his father and his before him - but breaks out to lead a rebel army against his former slave masters. Based on a true historical story.My first problem with this review is that I don't like 'swords and sandals' generally and maybe this is a chance to get of my chest why. Well, for a start I don't envy anybody in these things. What is wealth when you have nothing to spend it on but houses, women and wine - and even then you have to be very lucky. In those days everybody was poor - even the very rich!Given the above paragraph it might surprise you that I actually like this film, although with grave limits. This is Hollywood Rome where day-glow teeth abound and even female slaves look like they have wandered out of the beauty salon. Given that Kubrick (a late replacement director) was an intelligent man he must have been having a laugh when he presents props such as maps that are almost perfect.Like all of these sword-of-justice products the hero (Kirk Douglas in the title role) seems to have wandered in from another age and can point out all the errors, foibles and injustices that those in power perpetrate. Naturally such heroes have few faults themselves and never say anything non PC.Douglas enjoys running, jumping and fighting - so he spends a lot of time doing just that. Tony Curtis fancied himself as a magician (he even did an act on stage) and he shows us that he was quite good at it. Here he plays a rather effeminate man who learns to fight rather than entertain.Lawrence Olivier is often described as the greatest actor in the world. At his peak this may even have been true. He dwarfs everyone as bisexual warrior and diplomat Marcus Licinius Crassus. Years of stage of experience allows him to say things in a way that you believe that something important is being said - but have no real idea why!Peter Ustinov (Lentulus Batiatus) loves playing callous snakes and here he really goes to town as a slave-master. What a trophy cabinet the two of them have! Generally the film falls in to the trap of having the villain doing something interesting - or at least something that looks interesting and political - while the hero does little but fall in love and make speeches to men who seem to hang on his every word. This doesn't make him very interesting and the script seems to know that - happy to push him in to the background until Sparticus is actually needed.Without entering in to spoilers the end is downbeat rather than triumph. A hint at a better world, but little more. This was rare for films of the time and a brave step.",8,1,2,12 September 2005
Casablanca," All-time classic - but more happy accident than design
","Rick escapes war-torn Europe to open a dubious night-club in Africa, but his life is turned upside down by an old flame.So regularly viewed and reviewed, that I'll keep it short for fear of sending you to sleep; but I'd like to make three quick observations.1. Is Bogart (Rick) really in love with Bergman (Ilse)? If so why does he act like he does? Sacrifice means doing something you don't really want to do, but you do it for the general good. He has moved on with his life (he could have returned to the USA after Europe) and maybe doesn't want to turn back the clock? Equally, in the final reel, he merely acts to expedite the moment. This doesn't mean events could not progress later.2. Casablanca has the same smoke (fog, in Africa?) and hardboard sets that Warners used for every production around that time.3. Bogart never indicates who's side he is on until the picture winds down. Through image and viewing film we learn the truth, but that would be no good for a person watching the film for the first time or not being prive to the Bogart image. Surely things should have been at least hinted at earlier?We are among pro's here - and better still pros having acres of luck. Great casting (every one a winner!) and non more so than having the king of cool in the lead.  Also a  lesson in scripting with enough wisecracks to lighten the load, and the wisdom to keep build to a (great) climax(Many 'great' films are merely great intro's and climaxes. This is what the audience remembers. Just look at Jaws, for example.)This is movie making from a factory, not an art-house. Here you didn't politic for two years before you even start on production, you just got on with it. People involved here made three movies a year and thought nothing of it. This produced a lot of dross, but it produced just as much quality as the more measured and indulgent systems that followed.",8,1,3,23 April 2003
Minority Report," Visually dazzling film with one or two good ideas!
","Tom Cruise plays the murder squad policeman of tomorrow (2054) - here murder is prevented before the act by means of a set of 'PreCogs.' Water-bound, drugged up humans (give Amnesty International a call) with the special gift of predicting the future. Therefore the central 'murder' doesn't actually happen - some jackbooted SWAT team bursts in through the skylight just before the act. Bar the whiz-bang technology (which we will return to) we have a society a lot like today (only they don't swear as much!), where people eat, sleep and work without the need of tinfoil suits or magic pills. Cars do drive themselves though!We have Steven Spielberg in his, now common, 'reluctant' director role. Let us not get in to 'Billboard' politics, but I don't understand the man-inside beyond his need for constant pats on the back, recognition and applause. While noted as a nice and charitous guy - and he is - that doesn't mean he doesn't also have a fair sized ego.(He even helped form his own studio - Dreamworks - then he goes off to work for another! When you form/CO-form a business isn't it best to work for it rather than a competing rival? Or does show biz have another version of common-sense?)The problem with industrial technology (within the film itself) is that designers do not design superfluous parts for the purpose of them looking dramatic to the casual observer. Doesn't make any sense. But when you do have nonsense don't underline it by some kind of pseudo intellectual explanation as to why coloured balls have to roll down long plastic tubes before you can announce a would-be murderer - just let it pass!Minority Report is a clear example of reverse writing. Like coming up with a joke - you come up with a good punch line and work backwards to come up with a scenario that could lead you to that point. This comes up with a mixed bag of possible cliff-hanger clichés or twists to work towards - and the fact that Cruise's child has been killed (by persons unknown) sent my eyeballs a-rolling. Before we know it John Anderton (Tommy Cruise) is - for reasons a child could guess at - on the run from his former pals down at Nazi Jack Boot Central: and, as further expected, he leads them a merry dance up hill and down dale. This takes up a lot of the story and to be frank, goes on at least fifteen minutes too long. As we all know flight is only any good if you have somewhere to actually run to.While this is the Tom-and-tech show (the only love interest in the movie is his late son), it is good to see the Swedish veteran actor Max Von Sydow still in work after over a hundred films. Quite a few better than this and plenty made on the money this production spent on lunch.Steven S's has a poor record when casting Johnny Foreigner and I was sad to see his long-standing theme of foreigners (non Americans) not being trustworthy continues. Can't say anymore - but it leaves a lasting bad taste in mouth, just as much as the visual images leave a lasting impression on the eye.",7,0,1,11 December 2004
Training Day," Pointless theme-ride through the LA gutter, despite good acting and production values.
","Police and thieves are such a staple of TV that you have to be looking at making something special to make one stand out as a feature film.Here the producers try and make things bigger, bolder and more extreme but, sadly, this only makes the production more hysterical and far-fetched. No cop in the history of the force is quite as down-and-dirty as the one played here by Denzil Washington. Indeed he is probably as out-there as any cop in the history of cinema cops!Excess and success have often been mistaken for one another in the Oscar world and here Denzil took the main prize with this good, but hardly great, performance. The guy can grin and talk in double time (this guy knows about speech rhythm and stress - which is rare for an American actor), but this must have been a poor year. Nathan Hawke is actually just as good as the rookie that may - or may not - be corrupted.Here we are in 'blacktown after-dark' (for those that have seen Kentucky Fried Movie!) and you can be sure that the minute they step out of the car there will be gunshots, a chase and a death. Yes it is quite lively and the street hoods do look the real deal, but so what, they probably are the real deal!I feel for Hawke, the cop he is playing is a moron so he can only react not act. Hope he gets his own star gig soon - he looks ready.There are plenty of other movies that leave a horrible aftertaste - Boyz in the Hood, Menace 2 Society, Taxi Driver, to name but three - but there films have some social comment to make. This doesn't. This says: It is all rotten, it is all without hope. Bad places have bad cops so they are part of the problem not part of the solution. There is no redeeming qualities here. It is just a pointless theme ride through the LA gutter. Sadly it won't be the last.",5,12,25,2 May 2004
Se7en," Great thriller if a little cold and dehumanising.
","Two cops - one young, one old - chase a serial killer that is leaving a paper trail.This is actually one of the best films that I have seen that I have only wanted to watch one. The reason being that while it has an interesting plot, plenty of action and a great twist it also has a horrible aftertaste. Like spending too long trying to clear a blocked drain. Hollywood has, for far too long, glamorised crime and the chasing criminal so it is surprising to see a film maker going the other way. This is a dark, decrepit and cold world where everything is falling apart and unkept. This seems a deliberate policy move that features in many of David Fincher's films. Interesting - in that is different - but strangely alienating and depressing - and these are emotions I don't want to wish upon myself.The serial killer and the criminal that leaves clues are nothing new, but the way the plot develops is. If you know the twist the movie will be cut in half and thank god I saw it without knowing the pay-off- although I knew there was going to be one. This is a movie after all.Brad Pitt never convinces as a professional of any type. Here he seems to have become a cop overnight and without much training. Morgan Freeman does his usual quiet-but-logical act that has bought him fame so late in life. He is nearing retirement (in the film), but I thought all cops were about to retire in movies - I took that as read!This is very involving stuff and we are drawn to grandstand finish that we will remember forever - but what is Se7en in longterm reflection? A horrible world in which horrible people carry out horrible acts for reasons of self-gratification?Serial killers have existed since the dawn of time, but America is home to half of the world's population of them. Why is this? Maybe it is the last chance to make a mark on a society where being in the media and being in the spotlight are prized? When you have killed someone you are interesting, when you haven't you are not. Simple.",7,8,10,15 February 2004
The Big Lebowski," Top class black comedy - the stuff cults are made of!
","One Roger Lebowski is a slow-witted LA waster who spends most of his days in a drug induced haze and lives in a low rent apartment. Another is a rich businessman with a wayward trophy wife and who lives in a mansion. Witless debt collectors mistake one for the other and start a chain of funny, off-beat and intriguing events.The Coen Brothers are simply not capable of making a bad movie, they couldn't do so even if they tried. They are masters of taking things just far enough to be strange and off-beat and yet not let it all fall apart completely. Something that David Lynch should learn from. Even if you are not taken by the plot they throw so many extras at you that you can just enjoy the productions for those alone.This is something of crossbreed movie. Indeed it takes from Raymond Chandler to the Odd Couple stopping off at Pulp Fiction. Star turn is not Jeff Bridges (hippie Lebowski), but his bowling buddy John Goodman who puts in an amazing performance as a damaged and deranged Vietnam vet and some of his lines are laugh out loud funny - especially how he deals with a fellow bowler who has 'stepped over the line.' A little scene that stands up to the best of the funny business in Pulp Fiction.Maybe if you want to be harsh they do turn this in to a bit of a variety show that goes from the bowling alley small-talk, to surreal dreams scenes, to the tale of a how a pair of dimwits try to dig themselves out of a hole. Four letter words come thick and fast and you wonder whether we really need them. This is - after all - a silly comedy. Why cut off part of the audience? Equally why is Roger (the dim one) only called The Dude throughout and never by his first name? Good entertainment and sure to become a cult - if it is not already.",7,2,5,13 April 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Low budget Brit horror-satire which works better than you might expect.
","Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a slacker manager of a small London electrical store whose domestic life of old sofas, drink and video games leads him to lose his blonde girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). Can an unexplained plague of zombies be the catalyst for winning her back?A rare British comedy that was a hit both sides of the Atlantic - although it is one of those movies that you feel like you have watched after the 3 min trailer! There are some movies that have the word 'cult' written all over them from the opening scenes - this is one such case. Indeed this is a wonderful example of what you can do with a low budget and some good comedy performances, movie references and a couple of sets.The concept is simple: Slackers have the chance to redeem themselves through outrageous circumstances and people that we/they don't like get the rough end of poetic justice. Hardly original, but very much tried and tested.Strangely for a comedy this doesn't have a ton of laughs in it (more guffaws really) and often relies on uses of bizarre devices to get out of difficult situations: Cricket bat, shot gun, Prince records, etc.Like many comedies you actually like, there isn't a lot to it. Set up, problem, problem solved (or not solved). Take the zombie element out and you could run this as a rom-com about relationships. This is no surprise as the writers have been brought up on it.The in-jokes fly and while most are featured in the trivia column there are one or two that I spotted that are not present: The monkey impression gag comes from Pegg's sketch show past (We Know Where You live) where if silence reigned he would get up on the table and impersonate a monkey! (You had to see it to understand.)The greatest victory for Shaun of the Dead is that it injects some pace and drive in to the thing.They have learnt from Guy Richie about doing flash-pans,fantasy (that you think is real), double/treble takes (plan one, plan two, reality).The best thing about it is that it knows how long it can stay on the screen and how long you can string it out. Let us cheer a movie that has plenty of black comedy moments and knows when to sit down and let the credits play.",8,1,2,13 June 2005
The English Patient," Superb bit-of-everything cinema that treats you like an adult.
","During WW2 a spy and the wife of a diplomat have a Middle Eastern affair that has far reaching consequences for themselves and all those around them.If I was to defend the Oscar Academy it would be that it  gives an impetus (through awards and nominations)  to people to see 'difficult' films that go beyond spending two hours out of the rain with your brain in neutral.I have nothing against slick no-brain junk (there is good no-brain junk and bad no-brain junk) but cinema needs to be able to prove that it can, occasionally, produce depth, quality and meaning. You don't have to like the English Patient and you don't have to think it is an important film, but if you think Die Hard is a better film (and that is what the IMDB votes say!) then there can be no hope for cinema. Not as an important art form at least.The image of this film is of a stiff romantic talk-piece (partly the fault of the promotion people) but it is not, lots happens and there is no time when you can predict what is going to happen next. This is a three hour movie because it needs three hours to tell the story and get inside the many characters. I wouldn't suggest that this film is perfect. The bomb disposal scenes are pure cod drama and plenty is borrowed from other people's movies - Out of Africa and the general works of David Lean kept springing to mind. I have no idea whether Binoche (here playing a nurse) can really act, because I have never actually seen her do any. She is reduced to looking on with care or looking wide eyed with wonder, maybe that is enough for some people?
(Clearly it was for the Oscar people - she won the Best Supporting Actress award!)Lead Fiennes manages to produce a performance of total paradox in managing to be both cold and romantic as well as conveying emotion through horrific burns make up. I am not so sure about the accent, but I am not sure what an Hungarian linguist sounds like when speaking English! Lover Kristin Scott-Thomas has less to do, but I loved her restraint: sexy and passionate while never throwing anything in your face.The English Patient is one of those films you walk away from thinking 'I didn't know they still made films like that', I hope that I can say it again some time soon, but I am not holding my breath.",9,4,7,30 December 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Crude, rude and with plenty of non PC laughs.
","A set of small town preteens get their 'tiny minds' corrupted by an unsuitable movie and trigger a series of silly events that lead to war - and perhaps even apocalypse!Told by means of cheap cardboard cut-out animation with only one or two pieces of CGI.There is no way anybody can summit a comedy as silly and out-there as this. You could talk about this Trey Parker film from now until Christmas, but until you have seen it you won't understand the concept or how it all hangs together - or sometimes doesn't. The difference between the (same name) TV series and this film is that they take the joke further (and given that the TV series involved a talking turd - Mr Hanky - that is saying something!) and use more foul language and sexual images. This film takes the view that children using four letter words is funny - a concept only possible in a cartoon.While I haven't read all the reviews most seem to take the view that it is OK to use images of children in this way or at least not to question it. I am not so sure. The crude nature of the cartoon helps of course. If this was done in the manner of the best of Disney animation - although the costs would be astronomical! - then we would hear more about it.The No.1 rule of silly comedy being that there is no No.1 rule. You can go anywhere - even Hell! - and do anything. The targets are Canadians, dopey school teachers, overprotective parents, homeless people, world leaders and the off-beat folks that hang around in a 'redneck little town.'For reasons that maybe have something to do with the time it was being made Saddam Hussian is taken as dead - presuming that American's thought he soon would be? - and forms a homosexual relationship with the devil. Who he runs rings around. They make a highly comic couple.(The film was banned in Iraq when it came out - they even issued a statement as funny as anything on the screen! Is it now unbanned?)The really interesting part of this movie is that is uses mock old time show tunes to tell the story. The juxtaposition of this style of music being used in such a crude environment works for easy laughs - although only the unbelievable Uncle F***** song stays with you afterwards. I laugh just thinking about it.(Canadians Terrence and Philips might be the funniest cartoon characters of all time. Despite being the cause of all the trouble we don't see enough of them.) Yes there is a bit of a South Park's Greatest Hits about the thing and famous faces crop up to have the mickey taken out of them. The part with Wyonna Ryder at the war rally was the funniest thing I have seen in years. A real jaw dropper.The only thing is that it goes on too long for what it is. The laughs tend to slow down as the film draws to its silly end-of-days conclusion. It doesn't hold together as drama, but a series of scenes that are either funny or not funny. The George Clooney hospital part (voiced by the man himself) is one of the flops.Let us hope they now know the joke is over and we don't have a South Park II.",7,2,2,31 October 2004
Billy Elliot," Plodding low budget drama about music and dreams - that was a surprise world hit.
","Billy is a normal young kid from a normal 1980's mining town in the North East of England. However he finds that he prefers dancing to being hit on the nose at the local boxing club! It says a lot about how poor modern cinema is that this bit of kitchen sink fluff took off and became a hit. The budget is obviously so low that even the real life props look fake! I don't know who ordered the 'period' 1984 cars - but they shouldn't be in a job.The plot is borrowed from every girls-only magazine published since the 1960's where the plucky little miss 'wants to be a ballerina, but her mother won't let her.' Only they have swapped the sexes around. Talk about old wine in new bottles.There is nothing worse than not being charmed when all around you there are people that are. It is like being at a party and watching people get drunk, dance and kissing girls while you look on - long faced - from the corner. The general audience should be grateful that they don't know the North East, because if they did they would realise it is only a plastic version of it. It seems more like Yorkshire to me - but then I know these places better than most.The use of endless four letters words - while not unrealistic - doesn't make it any more real and cuts across the point of the exercise. Who is the thing aimed at if not kids. Why shut people of Billy's age out? The thing measures out equal doses of dance, music, black comedy and social realism with a light gay undertone that I don't really understand. There isn't the depth and script to understand it. It looks like a bolt-on to try and sell it to gay audiences.The sideline acting is vary passable apart from Julie Walters who clunks around in a boiler suit looking like a baby elephant. Is this supposed to be funny? Who knows. Someone, somewhere told the world that this woman has some kind of special talent - and the world seem to have gone along with it.(Don't get me wrong - she can act a bit, but seems to pop up like bad penny in every Brit pic ever made.) Naturally people evolve and change their opinion to become better and more rounded people - because that is what people do in movies. Billy is only made a loser so that he can be transformed in to a winner before our eyes.Lead Jamie Bell seems a nice enough kid though - it will be interesting to see if he is anything more than a flash in the pan though. Despite being star of the show here it takes more to make it in showbiz than a bit of cod Irish dancing - the fact is that I thought his footwork was strictly chorus material.",6,0,4,2 April 2005
The Others," A mini masterpiece from a new director to watch
","Just after the end of  world War II, a woman and her two photosensitive children live in an old isolated house in Jersey. However strange happenings start to occur after her servants quit in the middle of the night without warning.Amenabar wrote the script, directed the film and even wrote the music score too and I tell you what - he does a great job in all departments! He may speak English as a second language, but I couldn't tell from the use of language. Indeed he not only knows English, but also period English and slang!This uses light so sparingly that we get dragged in to this strange candle lit world of locked doors and drapes. What a smart and curious device that creates shadows and in intrigue in every corner - like a permanent night. There is no gore, but despite this it gives you the creeps and has many jumps and frights. I don't care how much you turn up the central heating you will feel cold watching this movie.Good performances all round here and Kidman just gets better and better. She should have been nominated for an Oscar for this. How strange to see Eric Sykes as the gardener with a secret. No English director would have cast him because he is a vet of English TV comedy and not serious cinema.This is not a big enough or original enough a piece to give the title classic, but it does what it sets out to do with style and then some. This is as good as Hitchcock and Kubrick when not hitting their absolute peaks. Think of The Birds and The Shinning and you get the general idea.When you think about it, it manages to do everything with a manor house, a small set of actors and a fog machine. No CGI, no stunt men and no blood. We will know a lot more when the director takes on his next piece, but let us hope he is as good as he appears to be here.",8,0,0,21 January 2004
L.A. Confidential," Interesting, well made, but wildly overrated.
","In 1950's LA a set of cops - good, bad and everything in-between - solve crime against the background of show biz and political sleaze.One of those movies that you almost  want to throw money against the pay-window to see and yet walk out feeling that you have been short changed. Maybe what people are praising is not the production - but the ideas and background. The age when gossip magazines threw back the covers of Hollywood (for the first time) to reveal actors and players as they really were. Sadly this just a bit of window dressing to tart up a tired old good-cop-bad-cop police drama.Forget the rave reviews: There is nothing new going on in the foreground. Indeed it works it way to a climax so utterly predictable and shop-worn that it is almost unbelievable. After having some originality and vitality it comes down to a climax that would make a B movie western writer blush!Stacey is cool, Crowe is mad as hell (and not going to take it), Pierce is the college boy that does everything by the book. The guilty and the half guilty and the guilty-by-association get mixed up, but what the hell, they only get pushed up against a wall and have dirty tricks played on them. Probably how it was way back then.Bassinger gets an Oscar for doing nothing but looking sexy. I mean what does she do by way of acting? Look like an expensive hooker? Speak like she is jaded and embittered? Sharon Stone was better in Basic Instinct (and others!) and didn't get a mention for that. Even stranger still she seems to be barely in the movie (a glorified extra even?) and had to talked in to taking the role in the first place. Talk about right place and right place!The trouble with the film is that is gets its novel ideas over too quick and all it has left is to try and bring a bit of poetic justice to a scene where poetic justice was probably very much absent.Sorry, this  a bit of a fraud on the audience, it pretends to be different, pretends to be brave, but in truth it doesn't have to courage of its own convictions. Looking at 1950's Hollywood sleaze on its own might have made a good movie, but this is too frightened of leaving the mainstream to be that film.",7,8,13,17 February 2004
The Prestige," Entertaining - but slightly overheated - mishmash of Victorian period melodrama and science fiction.
","Two Victorian London magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackson) become involved in professional rivalry which has dramatic and far-reaching consequences for both of them.Magic is by its nature being able to appear to bend the rules of nature and/or physics - while, in reality, being no more able to do so than you or I.Equally the role of an intelligent viewer is to try and guess and predict the unexplained, the how, or the hidden twist (if you believe there might be one). A film which is allowed to take both feet of the floor (more literally than metaphorically!) destroys all such audience games.You can't knock Michael Caine for his supporting roles, because he plays them so well. Jackson and Bale are both overheated and a bit hysterical, and besides which, professional rivals tend not to hate each other deep down. There is - again deep down - a respect and admiration for the skill of the other.Here, for the purpose of the plot and a does of extra drama, this relationship has to turn murderous. This film could have survived, and be even been better, with a bit less plot and a bit more breathing in the dusty backstage atmosphere of the music hall.(And very well created it is - the art direction is simply superb.)Feel for female lead Scarlett Johansson, not a lot to do and almost window dressing in this production. I will watch her career with interest, (which red-blooded male wouldn't?) when she has more to do than looking good in an assistant's costume.While entertained and involved I have to say this is a lesson more in what the audience is prepared to accept than it is a cleverly crafted film script. Many films contain nonsense and illogical developments, but this doesn't lay its cards out on the table early enough. You can't switch formats mid-film.In many ways, it is a form of cheating. Or more accurately a case of 'wouldn't it be good if only.....'",7,1,4,22 February 2011
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Beauty saloon bandits out for easy laughs
","In the old west two train robber fight hard to keep themselves one step head of the law -and each other!A smart alec comedy with enough white teeth and laughs for the large audience not to care too much about the central crime theme or the innocents on the receiving end.People seem tickled by the chemistry between stars Paul 'I don't like being a famous actor' Newman and Robert 'being good looking ruined my life' Redford, but it seems more competition as to who gets the last-laugh or who gets the best of the light. Bland, but good looking, Katherine Ross is thrown in to give the thing a bit of heterosexuality. What I don't understand is why films that deal frankly with real criminals, and are exclusively for adults (re Martin Scorsese), are attacked while people that deal with real criminals for family audiences are praised. I guess it as all about how the 'give me the money or I'll kill you' is put or whether it is put by someone with a healthy dollop of charisma.To sugar the pill even more we have Raindrops Keeping Falling on your head - which shows that they stopped films to show pop videos even in the late 1960's! Burt Bacharach and Hal David claimed an Oscar for it.Butch Cassidy was huge box office and why not? Large budget, good script and good looking stars on peak form. But, the word 'comedy' is like one of those circus tent dresses that fat women wear - it hides the sins underneath. I guess it proves that if you make a film that is silly (in relationship to the real story is claims to mirror) and unrealistic you cannot be attacked for it.Maybe I think too much - maybe I should be like this film's lap-it-up audience - just switch of my brain and treat it like simple entertainment. I tell you what, next time I watch it I will...",7,1,3,6 October 2002
Crash," A fantastic movie -- important, if not perfect
","In modern day LA a group of urban professionals, gangsters and their significant-others struggle with life, racism and relationships during a highly overheated 36 hours.The technique of Crash (the directorial product of Million Dollar Baby author Paul Haggis) is to flip between stories and characters like a horse fly buzzing around looking for fresh blood to suck before moving on to the next victim. Sometimes we don't stick around for the aftermath - as if it can be taken as read or presumed. Not original and in terms of plot development, but nevertheless very moving.Its major fault is that seeks to ring maximum emotion of the scenes at the price of plausibility or even clear reason. For example, I have no idea why Sandra Bullock's character suddenly saw the light and hugs her maid. To give but one example.What I like best is that nobody quite comes away clean. Nobody gets a full clean bill of health. Even honest cop Don Cheadle (the nearest thing to the main star) describes his partner as 'Mexican' when her parentage is not actually from Mexico. In LA - this movie says - very few people have time for detail or have much consideration for the feelings of others.Housewife Sandra Bullock is spoilt and presumes that the tattooed locksmith is a gang-banger - when he is not, he is a loving father. She chastises the Latin American housekeeper for not putting the cups away without seeing how much she does for them and what she provides.Politician husband Brendan Fraiser only wants to spin everything to his own advantage - even being car jacked! Cheadle is a cop with troubled blood relatives and a seen-it-done-it attitude to life. In this movie even cops are not all one and the same team.In other stories gangsters discuss the racism and stereotyping they help create and a storekeeper doesn't understand enough English to comprehend what a fellow tradesman is trying to say. And so it goes on.LA is portrayed fairly as a bag of races, creeds and winners/losers. But given the USA is a free country why do they chose to live there? Have they no choice? They are people with no general love of their fellow man - strangers, screw 'em, this movie seems to be saying. Nor does the movie allow you to relax - good people do bad things and bad people do good things. The movie rips away your normal security blanket.The snow (in LA?) and the cinematography play to make it seem like a kind of dream. Or even an extended 'serious' pop video. The real world - but not quite. A pastiche of the real LA and the real LA experience, but not the real one. I rate Crash one of the most important films of the new millennium. It asks questions (although without answering them all) about why America cannot settle down. We - in the UK - are heading towards having a capital where only half the resident population are white. And I knew London when it was as white as any major city in the world and yet it doesn't have this level of tension and animosity. Is this because you cannot - as the film opening line makes out - live totally behind steel and glass here?While this film seems to split people - I am glad it won the Best Picture Oscar. This is adult cinema in a world of cartoons. Let us hope that for director Paul Haggis good things come in threes and he has one more classic up his sleeve...",9,0,7,26 April 2007
Snatch," Tough laughs for strong stomach types.
","Three separate parties try to get their hands on a stolen diamond in the back streets of London.Oh Mr. Quentin Tarantino - just look what you have created. A thousand directors want to have a touch of your magic and judging by Jackie Brown you wouldn't mind a bit of it yourself. Your star pupil - Guy Richie (Mr Madonna to friends) - demonstrates here that not only has he got a complete set of Tarantino and Martin Scorsese DVD's - he's also seen The Hot Rock (1972): A diamond that is easily stolen but hard to actually keep.Richie is not a laugh-out-loud director more a guffaw-out-loud director as selfish and self-interested characters (all crooks to a man) play their cruel and violent game of cat-and-mouse. The black gang get the worse of it - getaway drivers that cannot even park, rob a bookmakers without money and then point guns with the word 'replica' printed on the side.(All the things that happen are based on real incidents that were captured on CCTV. Yes - including the one where a gangster gets his head caught in a rising security gate!)Best of the ensemble cast is Bricktop (Alan Ford) the head gangster and fight fixer who over-articulates and explains everything to the rest of the cast: His explanation of how to dispose of bodies by way of pigs and how best to chop up bodies ('you need to chop them in to six pieces and gather the parts together in one place...') are a revelation.(Strangely he reminded me of a  character from a Noel Coward play. He manages to make even the most bland lines such as 'you are not much use to me alive are you, Turkish?' and 'hope I haven't come at an inconvenient moment' funny.) Congratulations to Brad Pitt for playing a gypsy fighter that no one can understand (not even in the movie itself!) A real piece of casting inspiration. We are deep, deep in black comedy land here and only by keeping it ticking over at a fast (almost pop video) pace can you get away with it. There is no real parts for women and no sex. The characters are far too interest in making a big score or staying alive for all that.Brad Pitt plays a fighter that - if he was as good as he is here - would surely be boxing for real rather than in the bare-knuckle world; but what the hell, this is a film comedy. The fight scenes are well done by the way - although seem a lot like those that featured in BP's other black comedy Fight Club.Snatch has must-see appeal to those with strong stomachs that cannot get enough of Pulp Fiction/Goodfellers smart-ass dialogue. Well done Mr Madonna - let us hope that the next feature is just as good. Then you will have made three great films to Tarantino's two.",8,0,1,5 October 2002
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Elvis's favourite movie...
","A mad American general (Sterling Haydon) orders an nuclear attack on Russia that the rest of the US military machine finds hard to overturn.A film that has three major 'The's': The best regarded cold war film, the film that crowned director Kubrick as a genius, and the role(s) that made Peter Sellers the comic actor of the 60's. Today the cold war is dead - as is Kubrick, Sellers and Haydon - but this film's skill and brilliance lives on.Only Kubrick could have chosen to make a comedy film that used such a harsh backdrop as the very future of the world. This makes the film even better - counterbalancing the ultra dark nature of the film. Thankfully he did not end the film with a food fight as he originally planned.(That explains the long table in the war room. In reality no food or drink is allowed in war room locations in case it is spilled in to the sensitive equipment.)Strangely a more straight version of the 'ultimate nightmare' Fail-safe (1964) is generally forgotten, although it is, perhaps, better plotted and more true-to-life.Kubrick's admiration for Sellers allowed him to be cast in four roles (he only played three in the end): An RAF officer, the US President, the mad German scientist (Strangelove) and one of  the bomber pilots. He dropped out of the last role, mostly because he feared one of the stunts -  that could not have been doubled - that features at the end of the picture.(A picture - with Sellers dressed in pilots uniform - is still in circulation suggesting that filming of him in the role had even started. Replacement Slim Pickins was, allegedly, not told that it was a comedy, although it is hard to say this effected an actor not noted for his variety of delivery.)Seller's position in these three roles saved quite a bit of money on a film that required elaborate sets (that suffered from constant overheating). The film was only a modestly budgeted affair and therefore didn't feature Kubrick's over-the-top perfectionism that often grinds the actors to dust. At one stage George C. Scott falls over (clearly from losing grip on a shinny floor rather than a stunt) and the accident was left in. On the Shining (1980) Kubrick wanted 50 takes to get a door slam right!Despite having three shots at the prize Sellers doesn't come out of the film with the best comedy performance award. That goes to the constantly under-rated Sterling Haydon as the mad general who believes that fluoride in the water is responsible the world's plight!Dr Strangelove is in every way a classic and has another small footnote in history: It was Elvis Presley's  favourite film. According to friends he watched the film 40 to 50 times and would repeat the dialogue in time with the actors...",10,7,13,27 September 2002
MASH," Brilliant original theme -- but has its limits
","Surgeons in the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) keep their moral up by one-upmanship and practical jokes.They say that history is always distorted because it is always viewed the wrong way. Why should film history be any different? Certainly people viewing the film after the television series may be left a little short changed. Back in 1970 people had never seen Animal House high jinx being interspersed with bloody operations and the realities of war.On a score of originality it scores a near ten and I give half the credit to the film simply because it was made. If the book had been a flop it would have been pulped and made in another failed novel, while a failed film carries a lot more risk. An indication that Hollywood still has its worthy moments.As the stars are not in any great physical danger, the war seems to be viewed in abstract. A background detail that gets in the way of drinking, women chasing and deflating of egos. While this is a message picture the message is not pushed down your throats, indeed it plays out like a prison picture where the male prisoners have access to the luxuries of life, but cannot escape the barracks and the barbed wire.The film took Gould and Sutherland up a notch, and they work together well because they are a team. You can imagine one of them starting a sentence and other finishing it. By deed of being surgeons they can buck authority (what can they do to them - send them home?), but that point is weakened by authority never being portrayed as overbearing or over competent.
Certainly it is sexist and more so as the  years pass by. The humiliation of women they don't like being by far the most objectionable. 'Get me a nurse who won't get her tits in the way,' barks Gould at one point. While not a expert on surgical procedure I seem to detect (on TV documentaries)  that it is team work with everyone having a role and the respect of the others. Here women are instrument passers and brow-moppers rather than respected team players.The TV series that followed became an institution and, as I have said before, will never allow the film to be viewed in the same way again. The series allowed a certain amount of soap opera and repeating themes. Comforting tools that blunts the central message. The main thing that follows from the movie is that the male stars must always have the last laugh or come out on top. The main flaw in the movie is that it has nowhere to go and nothing to climax on. Naturally the war could end and they could all go home, but maybe that would have been a cop out? In the end they came up with a comic football game, which is as abstract to the central theme of the movie as anybody could get. For an important ground breaking film to have such a device seems almost disrespectful, but the more I think about it the more I can't help thinking that they couldn't do any better. Nothing would fit.  A quiet anti-climax, but it is a quiet anti-war film.",8,5,10,23 July 2003
The Doors," Kilmer's amazing performance saves the day, but only just!
","The story of the short - but influential - life of Jim Morrison and The Doors: who exploded on the music scene in the late 1960's and are still hugely popular today.(As if you don't know all this already!) The Doors were a fantastic group, and if you don't believe me just flick through a stranger's CD collection: There is usually a Doors compilation in their somewhere.But what do you want to believe about the group itself and what they represented and what they believed in? This movie believes The Doors were Jim Morrison and a group of half-assed sidekick men and to hell with the fact that some of the better tunes were written by other band members or the overall (organ based) sound had little to do with Jim Boy.Rock and roll cannot be encapsulated in two hours. All you can do is form lists and put lines through them one by one. Early life (lied about - by JM - because it didn't fit hippie fashion), form the band, band gets famous, band takes drugs, band falls out over drugs, you know the full list as well as I do - unless you are coming to rock movies for the first time.The central problem I have is I don't like the stoned or the drunk. Indeed most sober people don't. I can't care less if the person that is drunk/stoned is very talented or has written great songs or even that they are sexy. They are bores and they are bores that urinate on the carpet. JM urinated on a lot of people's carpet and from his early death it is clear that as a drinker he was a bit of a lightweight.(Often consumed - in the street fashion - straight from the bottle.)When sober (more times than this movie acknowledges) he was a big reader and a smart enough guy, but rock doesn't like smart all that much. It much prefers extroverts with an inflated sense of their own importance and who die young enough to not embarrass the fans by their middle age or worse. As Bono once said 'I don't want to be a firework that explodes for the enjoyment of the general public.' What holds this movie together is Val Kilmer. My word is he good. He looks Morrison, he acts Morrison and he sings Morrison. Nobody could be better. Even the original band were amazed. The concert scenes are so well created that they look like a documentary and - strange though it may sound - they should have recorded a full concert and put it out as an extra on the DVD. A new art form, a fictionalised version of a real 1960's gig.Indeed, Kilmer is as strong as the other band members are weak. Indeed they are so weak they are almost extras in their own movie (the title is a con - this is Jimmy and the Whoever's!) Meg Ryan is a total miscast as his nagging wife and Billy Idol (who is called Cat in the movie) seems to need to shout things at random to remind people he is still there. If you can remember the names of the actors playing the other band members or recall a line they said you need to go on the road as Mr. Memory! However at times I don't know if they are angry at Morrison or their itchy wigs.Narcotic taking (legal or illegal) is someone else's business. It is easy for me - as someone that views self-poisoning as the greatest form of madness on the planet - to claim to be moral superior just because it isn't my knee-jerk. However it does seem to work for artistic people, at least for a short while. It makes things better before it makes things much worse. And it doesn't get any worse than being in your grave at 27 - unless that is the place you want to be.To love someone you have to love them when they are old, bald or grey. The fans that desecrate his grave (and those around it) at PerÃ¨ Lachaise in Paris (nothing like shown in this movie, by the way - look up the cemeteries own web site on Google) like him dead and buried. You don't even have to pay to be in his company. The Lizard King is dead, long live the next wandering poet and their entertaining and manic odes to their own self-pity...",7,3,4,19 May 2007
Closer," Enjoy spending time with modern urban self-centred types with no soul? If 'yes' this is the movie for you then!
","A couple of urban self-centred professional male types play various games with one another and the female partners in their life.Crap. I would have fitted this in to a sentence like 'this film was crap' but I was in to too much of hurry to say the word. Indeed I want to call it 'overblown crap', but the word overblown would have delayed the key word! Owen, Portman, Roberts and Law spout lines at each other like they each have their own gag writer speaking through an ear piece (clever dick line -- clever dick line back -- clever dick line -- clever dick line back. On and on it goes like a tape loop. Or when they tire of that fall back on that old standby of 'I love you -- no you don't you hate me -- oh OK, I don't love you-- you liar you do love me!' Am I supposed to be thrilled by explicit language (how many times do the female leads talk -- or shout-- about orgasms?) and to increase the thrill factor we have key scenes in lapdancing clubs. Just to prove the script wasn't written in 1972 -- which it could otherwise have been!(If I ran a club I would be looking to recruit better than short, skinny, flat chested types such as Portman!) Thankfully the women can't grow designer stubble (because I am sure they would) but they still spout sexual banalities as if they are males. Indeed this seems to follow that line in Transporting in which males and females are now 'one big sex.'In the background London slips by like piece of revolving scenery, even though it is the real thing. Maybe the fact it is clearly very early in the morning makes the place look so different from the 'no room to breath' place I occasionally visit.The film reminds me of one those scenes in which friends from work drag along people that you don't like for an evening out and when they leave you say (to yourself) 'good riddens to bad rubbish.'",4,0,1,26 March 2006
Taxi Driver," Singing In The Rain for the manic depressive set
","A disturbed and damaged Vietnam vet returns to his native New York and take up a job as a taxi driver; which gives him a perfect viewing platform for the horrors of big city life.As a portrait of New York inner-city sleaze in the 1970's - the city really was broke and  falling down (literally and morally) - it is important and accurate, but sadly descends in to the morbid and then the ludicrous, in that order. Thankfully with have prime-time De Niro in the lead, one few actors that can go crazy without totally alienating the audience.While many focus on the nonsensical ending as their main quibble, mine is with the main character. If you want to condemn sleaze you have to do so from a position of being above it or beyond it: Our anti-hero seems to be right at home in the gutter with drug dealers, pimps, whores, gun sellers, porn theatres and general riffraff. He as much a consumer as a  condemning witness. Very good acting by all concerned and well regarded, but also a very disposable movie. What are we learning here - that Times Square was (it has been cleaned up since) a sleaze pot? Or that the big city has an ugly underbelly? How stupid and ignorant does Scorsese think we are? I found the whole thing slightly depressing and even dangerous - political assassination as a way of making a love gesture? (Talk about handing out irresponsible ideas to the general public!)This is the voice of a man (with writer Schrader) saying 'nothing can be done.' As we have seen, things can be done and things can be made better. The writer and director are, here, a bit like tabloid journalists, secretly head-over-heels in love with what they are pretending to condemn.",6,0,4,27 April 2003
Capote," Slow, well made and absorbing portrait of a self-destructive genius
","A recreation of how, on a whim, celebrity author Truman Capote found true fame and fortune through his 'hands-on' coverage of an ongoing multiple murder investigation: only to find events overtaking and - ultimately - almost destroying his life.America has many interesting historical tales, but being a new country not as many as, say, England. For such reasons we should be grateful that this fantastic and important moment should be captured with such skill and realistic acting - including an absolutely knockout award winning performance by Philip Seymore Hoffman in the title role. Certainly worth the price of admission by itself.What do you think of Truman Capote, if anything? An icon, a waster, a con man, one of the best American writers of all time, a social glad fly, a braggart, a substance abuser, an original thinker, a stool pigeon of the jet-set? I think all of the above and more, however his greatest skill was as a self-promoter of his own genius.The movie clearly doesn't have a lot of money to spend and this reduces where the camera can wander or linger. However this, for once, helps. It is a close-up film, so much so much so that it is sometimes hard to breath.Nor does the film want to dramatise the back-story of how Capote got semi-famous, a lot of the 'great moments' are told in casual boastful reminiscing. His (homo)sexuality is both present and relevant, knowing how to manipulate a man it by patiently getting to know his weaknesses and aspirations. However limited they are in a death-row cell.How ironic that his assistant - Harper Lee (a far too dull Catherine Keener) - should also have a brush with fame and fortune via her classic book: To Kill a Mocking Bird. Almost viewed here as an annoying interruption in to the central drama. The film doesn't take any view over whether Capote himself had any (secret) role in its creation. A rumour that circulates to this very day.What is great about the movie is that we (mostly) know the story and the outcome (after all, it has been filmed not once but twice!) I certainly did and I am sure that all the professional reviewers did too, but it doesn't hurt the reviews one little bit. Indeed the decision not to present this as a thriller lets the tone remain even and slow. I liked this approach, although I am sure it is jarring to most watcher of modern cinema.This film works best at showing the randomness and callousness of life. Where the worst possible scenario for one family becomes the making of another, at least on a temporary basis. Yes, one man's ending really is another's beginning.The honest, hardworking, welcoming townsfolk of Kansas come off the best in terms of human values, but we are not entertained, intrigued or thrilled by basic honest human values. That is the central sin that we all have to bare and for sensitive types like Capote this home truth can suffocate.Despite the title there should surely be a film about the full life of Capote - although I would be pushed to say who could play him. Maybe it would be a classic three actor job?",8,1,1,7 May 2007
Life of Pi," Entertaining special effects festival with alleged depth and meaning.
","Told in the style of a story-within-a-story (very Heart of Darkness, the original novel) a middle aged man tells two stories (to a visiting journalist) of how he - as a teenager - survived a shipwreck thanks to a lifeboat. But which does the listener believe? The standard version or a very bizarre version involving circus animals? In the 'bizarre' a boy (Suraj Sharma) is set adrift on a lifeboat with only a wild tiger for proper company. The tiger being part of a zoo being transported to Canada. The tale of how they get along and/or both survive takes over most of the rest of the film.What an unlikely premise for a film this is! I came to it with an open mind and left it with a bit of an open mind too. Lots of thrills and spills and the usual special effects wham-bams which modern cinema has to offer (I didn't see it in 3D) but I am not sure what this was supposed to be about (other than basic survival) or why it needed to be structured the way it was.The set-up is simply tedious and since the production seemed to want to shout its central novelty from the rooftops it became a bit of a wrist glancer as it worked its way towards this - inevitable - central novelty. Either we get to know the people well (think The Deer Hunter) or don't bother at all. I mean GÃ©rard Depardieu in a cameo role? For what purpose? The central character is mad as a bat anyway. He goes out on deck in a storm with nothing on but a shirt. Do you know how cold it is in the middle of an ocean? He dances about as the cross waves crash over him. Oh what fun it is to have ice cold waves crash over you! Laugh a minute.Given there is little else to see or talk about (and I don't want to start spoilers) how does a wild tiger (who only feeds on land anyway) catch anything from a boat. And how much fresh water does it need a day. Apart from lots? Not very realistic to nature is it? Like War and Peace is something about Russia this is something about religion. I suppose people who escape disaster tend to believe in God more than those who don't. Might just be luck though.The good thing is that I found it generally entertaining. And Shama is solid, although he doesn't have to do much other than be thrown around in front of a green screen. Would be very tedious to watch twice (apart from seeing in its intended 3D on a big screen) and that is the best acid test of a good movie.",7,0,1,2 January 2014
Lost in Translation," Great piece of dreamy cinema - like a highly restrained Last Tango in Paris.
","Bill Murray is in Tokyo for a whiskey commercial and the far younger Scarlet Johnson is in Tokyo because her photographer husband is shooting a hip pop group. Somehow -- and some way -- they get involved in a kind of non sexual affair.(Like a shipboard romance without a ship!) Americans in the main don't travel. The majority of Americans don't even own a passport. Americans in the main don't speak foreign languages and are frightened of places that don't speak English. They nearest thing they do is to go to the movies and so movie clichés is all they know about the world.I have travelled and I do know the world from first hand experience and let me tell you something -- I don't really like Japan. It is clean, polite and fairly crime free (in terms of violent crime anyway), but somehow they envy robots. The teach people robotic style and they live robotic lives. They have no natural resources of their own -- no oil, no coal, no gas -- and yet they have a Western style economy.Don't get me wrong I admire intelligence and hard work, but let us thank god that the whole world isn't like Japan. We'd have no rock and roll songs to sing badly (as they do in this movie) or most of the great arts: Things that are the product of the free thinker.I was first introduced to Sofia Copolla when she produced what was the worst performance I have ever seen in a major movie (Godfather III) and so thank the living lord she has other talents -- although this might be a lucky fluke. I didn't like the Virgin Suicides at all -- not one little bit, indeed I hated everything about it.Here she is lucky in being a beginner (look at the goof index!) that has fallen in to the company of pros. Bill Murray's face is not something I wished to linger on in his 'Meatballs' prime and yet he has that something that no one can put their finger on. He is that laughing uncle that cheers up the family get together -- the kind that uses words as (secret) weapon. You'd like to be his friend.Nothing really important happens in this movie. It reminds me somewhat of Manhattan (the Woody Alan movie) in its Spring and Autumn pairing and sense of local exploration.It also reminds me of Last Tango in Paris (although this is far less graphically sexual) in its use of a novelty setting. The success of this movie demonstrates that the American audience (where it has done best of all by any mathematics) are using this film to go places that they wouldn't dream of going and experiencing things they wouldn't dream of experiencing.Why not pack a bag and go to Asia or places in Europe that are not tourist clichés? Then you can have experiences like this for real and find out more about yourself and how the whole world isn't -- and doesn't want to be -- an imitation of American culture.",8,0,1,10 November 2005
Barry Lyndon," Restrained historical drama with incredible period detail.
","A roguish young Irishman goes on a tour of Europe and - various military adventures down the line - falls in to a marriage of financial convenience.Three hours of screen time is long by anybody's standards, but at least you are viewing the incredible vision of Stanley Kubrick for that time. Whatever you might say about him, there are moments in all his films (even Clockwork Orange, which I detest) that are magical and moving.Here there is not a scene, prop or location that doesn't ring true to the period; although maybe a bit over-the-top picture postcard at times.
Many indoor scenes seem designed to make the world almost in to a moving painting, in fact there are times when we linger (for a few seconds) in stillness before dialogue/action starts to further the effect.Some say Ryan O'Neil was too modern for the central role, but I disagree, his acting is far from Oscar material but it gets us through the movie with minimal fuss. While BL is clearly not a man of honour, a lot of the time he is merely doing what he needs to do to get by and I found him hard to dislike - even through he is a child beater!Often he is given no real lines, but emotes on the tragedy and his traps with looks, anxious glances and glazed expressions. Female lead Marissa Berenson (although hardly in the picture on the old stopwatch) seems chosen for her dazzling profile - which we linger on slowly and lovingly, by order of films joint producer and director. We don't know her or understand her though - and that is the film's one major fault.BL is the kind of film that you are going to have to get yourself prepared for mentally and in terms of sitting comfort. There are real moments of mastery here (the duelling scenes - with the rules being explained slowly and clearly - are the work of someone who understands tension and timing perfectly), but while I salute it for its technical expertise and loving care, it does leave you with the feeling that you have spent three hours in an art gallery as opposed to watching a film.",7,4,9,5 May 2003
Full Metal Jacket," Strong stuff - but made far too late to matter
","A group of new recruits train for Vietnam in a harsh boot camp, before going off  to fight for real.Kubrick's ability to mix black comedy with tension and action is certainly amazing; and you could even dismiss it as fluke if he hadn't achieved it before. There are scene's in this movie that are so profound and memorable that you will be able to remember them clearly a 100 movies later (he is the master of the sustained climax), but yet the whole project doesn't hang together at all.Other movies have simply been here before and - it has to be said - done it all a whole lot better. Platoon, being the best example.R Lee Ermey performance as the bawling sergeant major should have won him a best supporting actor Oscar (he won other awards). Nevermind, it must be one of the best supporting performances of all time and will be remembered when most of  the actual winners have been forgotten. As has been said before, only the first part (in boot camp) really works. The training camp scene actually has its own climax and makes the point of the movie all by itself.  Strangely the tension eases when the battle actually begins: we are, by then, all geared up for the death, tragedy and waste that we all know is coming. Kubrick forgets that we spend our lives watching movies - not hiding in a some luxury cave like him. 'War is hell' - well hold the front page!(The most amazing thing is that the scenes of carnage and wrecked buildings was actually filmed in central London. Indeed boat trippers going down the Thames could glimpse the movie being made and the sets were simply left after they were blown apart, making them a tourist attraction by themselves. They have since being demolished to make way for new apartment blocks.)If only Kubrick had made this film shortly after (or even during) Vietnam. What an impact it would have had. Despite this, it is a brilliant film in parts and pretty good in overall impact, but he loses touch with what other directors have always known, 'to care with have to know.' Here we barely know anybody beyond basic name recognition and no character actor can (or is allowed) to steal the picture other than Ermey who only has a limited first half role. It could, and should, have been a whole lot  better, but at the time of production Kubrick was clearly a man not listening to voices outside his own head and clearly not aware of how dated much of his technique now is: Simply running around with hand-held cameras doesn't, by itself, create great drama and tension. Not even when you more-or-less invented the technique yourself.",8,0,1,23 May 2003
Top Secret!," It doesn't get much sillier than this - and they even say so in song!
","An American rock and roll idol goes behind the iron curtain (while there was one!) for a culture fest but instead becomes involved in the resistance movement.Forget about the film itself, the very idea of an Elvis Presley movie being mixed with a French resistance film and produced by the Airplane! crew is enough for laugh number one. Not only is this a bizarre world but seems to be playing games with time and history, the communist East Germany being portrayed as a kind of war time Nazi set-up!Kilmer does well with an impossible role to the point where you wonder if he didn't miss his vocation. He can sing and dance better than many real singers and he proved in The Doors that he is really a major musical  force. Strangely it is rumoured that he didn't realise this was a satire!The stupidity of many Elvis movies and those Saturday morning children's reels (scientist and beautiful daughter) are taken to the cleaners and you have fantastic sight gags. The 'falling guard' gag is one of the best sight gags in the history of movies - I challenge anyone not to laugh at it.I enjoy a stupid movie every now and then and admit I enjoyed this one. Clearly the authors know little about German history or  European culture and the little they do know seems cribbed from watching bad B movies on the subject, but what the hell. This is too stupid for anyone to get seriously uptight about. 'How silly can you get?' sings Kilmer at one point in the film: Maybe a little, but not that much!",7,53,63,24 February 2004
The Godfather: Part II," Very well made pulp fiction with a fantastic cast - but still a historical whitewash.
","A look back and look forward at how the Mafia don Vito Corleone gained his original power and the continuing saga of how a son (Michael) chooses to drive forward the criminal empire of his late father.As the great American novel has not been written (an opinion just as popular in America as elsewhere) our cousins over the sea have no option but to over praise the work of better-than-average pulp writers. The vastly overrated Ernest Hemmingway, the junk master that was a Peter Benchley and the schlock with snobbery that is Thomas Harris. Don't get me wrong, all very readable - but great art? Great vision? Something you couldn't live a full and happy life without?As the groundbreaking film maker Spaniard Luis Bunuel once said: 'Today's culture is unfortunately inseparable from economic and military power. A ruling Nation can impose its culture and give a worldwide fame to a second-rate writer like Hemingway. Steinbeck is important due to American guns. Had Dos Passos and Faulkner been born in Paraguay or in Turkey, who'd read them?' The self-opinions of Mario Puzo (script and book) are probably in line with the above. Until he wrote the Godfather he even worried about keeping food on the table. How can you consider yourself an artist when you are writing rubbish like Earthquake? However, give him credit, he saw Hell's Kitchen for real and it shows.With the Godfather saga many people mistake a heavy subject for heavy writing. However well done it is (production values are sky high and the casting is a dream) this isn't anything more than a thousand TV writers couldn't knock up. While simultaneously looking back and looking forward can be confusing (one of these things that you need to warned about) it leads you to believe that the ex don is a better person than the future don simply because he had so much pushed on to his plate and had to make tough decisions. However he kills to replace the corrupt and becomes equally corrupt himself. Only on a bigger scale.Men of honour is nonsense - they beat/killed, threatened and bribed. They never made any money, they simply took money. If you are interested they took just as readily from criminals (like drug dealers) as they did from honest people. While this shows power being taken at the point of a gun - where are the goons beating the grocery store owner because he wouldn't pay the protection money? Such a scene would shatter this movie like it would a 1,000 foot drop would shatter a Chinese Ming vase.Coppola doesn't like film editors - they want to cut out scenes of people looking in to the middle distance, waiting for people to arrive and generally repeating themselves. The Mafia is male world and the women don't have much of a life - they don't even get to bring in cups of tea. The men are not happy people, but if they paid their electricity bills and had a hobby it would help. The moral is an obvious one - money doesn't buy happiness. But it allows you to be miserable in (Long Island) comfort.Director Coppola and writer Puzo had no choice but to write this as a tragedy. They lay it on too thick though, as they are trying to bring in higher morals to a story that doesn't have it and (as I said above) it doesn't want to kick over enough rocks. This accepted the cast is amazing - Robert DeNiro is on especially fine form - but the message(s) are uneven and dubious. All cons are full time liars and they even lie to themselves - in this little world the words mean little and we have too many of them.",8,1,4,10 October 2006
The Aviator," Hollow but visually impressive portrait of America's favourite loon!
","The early life of billionaire flier and racist (not tackled for box office reasons!) oddball Howard Hughes.There are some people whose name comes with a built in full stop. A moment to pause while you think of all those things they did, achieved or represented. Howard Hughes is one such case, but you cannot rank him up with the great visionaries or the great eccentrics like Einstein, Van Gough or Michael Angelo - these people mixed talent with their madness. As director Martin Scorsese is forced to admit (after the entertaining crash-bang has ended) - most of the things that HH came up with didn't work or couldn't work.(Jane Russell never wore the bra he designed for her over-sized breasts - a point that the film skirts around.) Hughes took the money of his (far more brilliant) father and while entertaining with it - didn't spend too much time at school learning the basic rules of flying or film making (you try sitting through anything other than Hells Angels). However with money you can buy your own trophies and good PR- and Hughes had very deep pockets.Martin Scorsese revisits some of his greatest hits and greatest flops in this movie. The long drawn out entrance to a night-club from Goodfellas and the souped-up camp of New York, New York: When you to any night-club in a film you can be sure that every extra will look like a professional dancer and the main players will smoke/drink (although Hughes didn't) and exchange loaded barbs. Amazing how witty the whole world is in films! Leo DiCaprio has an unfortunate face. He is destined to look 15 until late middle age and you can't do a thing about it. Stick all the fluff you want on his face and then add a bottle of hair grease and he still looks like he has stepped out of Buggsy Malone. He is not a bad actor (and getting better) but no one can claim he was cast for anything other than box office. Worse Martin Scorsese uses lighting to try and bring gravitas to his unconvincing appearance. He is just miscast and that is the end of it.Katherine Hepburn (here played by Cate Blanchett: Deserved as Oscar? I'm not sure!) had no taste in men. She liked to be the superior partner is her relationships so she chose oddballs, broke artists and addicts. Maybe these were the few men she didn't scare away. Hughes had money and toys and while it is presented here as some central relationship (Hughes treated all women as if they could be bought, sold or exchanged) it was nothing of the sort. Spencer Tracy was one of Americas greatest actors but also a chronic and incurable alcoholic. In him she found her ideal match!Madness is hard to capture on film. It is often not a level dip. It can come and go, get worse, get better, even be effected by the weather. No one has a clue if it is was two planes crashes (there might have been more) or some disease that took HH out of circulation. Clifford Irving thought Hughes was too mad to dispute his fake autobiography (not featured here) but he pulled himself together. Even from his self-made lunatic asylum bed! It is good to see that Scoresese is back on something like form after a string of so-so efforts. Despite the money he is given to spend on props the quality of actor isn't around to pull this kind of thing off. Too many dough boys with plastic teeth and empty eyes. Without these bricks nobody - and I mean nobody - can make an engrossing classic film. All you can come up with is pretty backdrops and sweeping scores and hope nobody notices the lack of major talent in the speaking parts.",7,2,4,29 October 2006
The Bourne Identity," Professional thriller-by-numbers that does its job.
","A young man is washed ashore badly injured and not knowing who he is and what he is all about. What is worse he seems to have a band of hit men on his trail.I'll keep this short because this isn't a movie you want to linger on long. We have seen everything before, and we have seen everything before and better. And, to be fair, we have seen it all before and worse.A very good example of those 'excuse' plots that allows you to throw everything and the kitchen sink at the screen. This simply skips around Europe having mini set-ups and mini climaxes that serve no purpose other than to provide cheap (although I bet the producers didn't think so) thrills. Not that this is all of a bad thing. Matt Damion is quite good, baby faced and non showy, he gets the job done without exposing too many of his acting bones. You can hardly win Oscars playing a man who doesn't know who he is himself!This chooses to use natural and half light, which makes things look more real, but had me squinting at my television set. The much discussed car chase is good, but nothing that you would want to pay to see again.I found myself filing this one under 'contrived and forgettable.'",6,0,1,2 May 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Slow and poe-faced with a film-runs-out-the-projector ending
","A 'little person' goes on a mission in a mystical never-never land with the help of a magic ring.How interesting it is that this film was, for a short time, atop of the IMDb chart and still sits in the top ten. Interesting because it lacks so many of the things usually associated with IMDb top picks and has a script that is especially plodding and banal.Special effects are well used, but most of the actors stride about in a world of their own speaking the words as if they were Shakespeare; while - in fact - it is little better than the bland dialogue of a thousand other films (TV and otherwise) that cover the same ground. Indeed films like Willow (which was a rip-off of the original book) not only has a better script, but was a more enjoyable film to watch! Oh my word does this movie take itself sooooo seriously. Acting is not camera, but to some mystical middle distance. With most of the full sized males sporting hippie haircuts and designer Goth you wonder if it isn't a prelude to one of those extended heavy metal videos. The problem isn't that this is a totally bad movie. It has its moments (make-up and backgrounds are stunning), only it is not very good either. Thank god it didn't win (or should I say 'steal'?) Best Picture Oscar. I mean what actually happens over the six hours it seems to last? A group of people (who I care/know little about both before and after) go on a mission and others try and stop them with a load of crash-bang-whallop swordplay. Romance is thrown in like a quick commercial break, but women matter little here. To call them sideline characters would be to inflate their status.At the end of the day J.R.R. Tolkien is a vastly overrated author. Forced as I was to read his never-never land fargos while at school, I found them boring, unimaginative (squeaky-clean-good versus ugly-unremitting-evil with coincidence and luck used to paper over the cracks) and far worse: humour less. Good descriptive language is probably their only major asset.The home truth is that I am not really that interested in little people that live in holes in some cod-medieval never-never land. The second major point is that film has no climax - it just ends. You have to sit (and maybe pay?) to see two more films before you get to the end. I would be amazed if either of them feature anything more than small variations on the limited tricks displayed here and the last thing I want to do is go through this elongated codswhallop again.",5,0,2,3 September 2003

Can they - somehow - meet in the middle?How great it is to see a film push so many bad messages: From smoking to disrespecting all authority (who grin and bare it - which makes it OK?) through dangerous driving on public property.Here the plot stops to make room for a song and dance number irrespective of whether be something to do with what has just gone on or help us understand events better. Given that the songs are passable and the plot terrible we don't mind.(In fact we welcome it with open arms like a tight pair of shoes being taken off!)The music is fun and everybody is throwing themselves around having the time of their lives - but this just a set of pop video's linked by a plot that seems to want to get in every 50's teen movie cliché it can think of.Many films are actually about nothing. Some of them are praised more than this and are hell on earth to sit through. Here we have lots of fun scenes that you find yourself enjoying while pretending not to.So to summate: It is junk - it made millions - it is camp - it cemented Travolta a star - it is cliché - it gave Newton-John her fifteen minutes - it is silly - it made film soundtrack history.

Here they have made it.Tom Hanks on an island. How many gags can you come up with? Learning to make fire? Finding shelter? Painting a volleyball and talking to it? Yes they have played all the cards that are available, but the hand is, sadly, threadbare. The world's biggest Hank/Zemeckis fan is going to need a spare cushion to be able to stand three hours of this. Even when Hanks was doing exploitation it was entertaining exploitation. Given his slightly chubby appearance Hanks looks like he misses his gym as much as the other luxuries of life.Sure, the movie has its moments of mild drama and interest, but even the word thin is an understatement.

Cold Mountain," Basic human values laid bare - for those with the time and inclination to explore them.
","A slightly narratively-divided tale of how America was torn apart by civil war using the device of two people (Inman and Ada) that want to be together despite all that has happened.This is a classic case of a movie which you can either get inside and consider a minor classic (as I do) or one that you get left outside of. In which case you may well use puns based on the word 'cold'. I think the IMDb reviews reflect that.What is amazing is that some of the serious UK press gave this a drubbing and the kind of ratings you would expect for X Men 13. If cinema is going to be a serious art form then it needs movies like this. Big money has been spent on what might be (crudely) called quality art-house with mainstream players.Not that it is perfect: Anthony Minghella has a tendency to spend a long time emoting and explaining when the actions and motives of the main players are already clear. War is hell and being on the losing side of a war is an even greater hell. Like Francis Ford Copolla - he tends to linger on a scene long after a point has been made or an action has occurred.America has never looked kindly at country people. It has a culture that is urban based and urban-basting. In cinema often a bunch of inbreed hillbillies that cannot be trusted. Growing food will never be hip and trendy and let's not pretend there is any chance of a makeover. The historical nature of this production doesn't change a thing.The concept of lovers torn apart (by war) is not new, nor is strong women that can cope on their own. There is plenty of cod drama here (fights, war, chase, capture, life-and-death struggles, etc.) but it has a proper setting. Tragic scenes are followed by happy scenes - because that is how life is and was.I thought all the main players were good. Nicole Kidman might have been a bit too pretty and made up at times and Renee Zellweger a bit over-the-top crude, but they worked well off each other. Jude Law has the kind of face (and hollow look) that the camera can focus on for long periods without him doing a lot. He is almost in another movie as he tries to fight his way home.Congratulations to Miramax for putting up so much money to make a risk piece - I hope you got your money back so you can invest it in more quality productions. Cinema that is worth the entrance money and that can send you away moved.",8,2,5,8 November 2006
Doctor Zhivago," Overheated soap opera pretending to be serious history
","A couple have an adulterous affair against the background of the Russian revolution.What a great premise this is - the setting of Russia and the revolution lets people congratulate themselves that they are viewing something heavy while what they are really getting is what they really like: A soap opera that features a sloppy romance between two good looking people with a sweeping soundtrack for those that are not quite getting the drift.I saw it first time when I was probably too young (like the Godfather) so when I saw it again I thought I would probably find more in it. Wrong. I didn't like it any more on the second viewing as I did the first, in truth it looked even more cardboard the second time.Don't get me wrong, plenty of pros at work here and they have all the toys in the drama playbox to throw at us (war, isn't it a godsend to dramatists!?), but it is all so contrived. I actually like Omar Sharif in the lead, a much underrated actor with real screen magnetism, but Julie Christie is an empty vessel of a performer from the school of stand-there-and-look-beautiful. When her looks faded her career nosedived because she is not an actress and cannot do characters.Nothing wrong with giving the audience what they want and plenty think they are seeing something special, but I couldn't get involved with this film. My heterosexuality prevents me from seeing anything in Omar and Julie looks every inch of the no-chance girl that wouldn't give you the time of day in real life. Sorry, I was left feeling as cold as the sets on which the action takes place on both viewings.",6,10,22,5 January 2004
The Shining," Jack pulling faces, Shelly acting scared - then the weird science bit.
","I have a grand overall theory about music and film. Much popular music is the kind of music you can easily ignore because most people that buy music never listen to it in isolation. It is background noise. Easy listening - more like not really listening.Growing up the biggest selling LP was Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. This was for me the perfect example, they even used it on the soundtrack of the Exorcist. You could even watch a feature film while it was playing!In the same vein most blockbusters are not really proper films at all. Merely novelty rides or one trick ponies. Star Wars (video game), Jaws (man eating rubber shark), Superman (man that can fly) and Psycho (confidence trick) are four that I can throw up without thinking. Nothing wrong with them - all well worth one sitting - what bugs me is that people think they can convert them in to art simply by throwing a lot of long words at them. They are fast food for the brain. You enjoy and move on - unless you are being paid to make them more than they really are!Here is another perfect example of the thrill ride format. Nothing really happens that doesn't happen in a horror B, but it has one or two image ideas that it pulls off. But overall it is just a short ghost train ride in the snow.Kubrick was a very rude man making this film. Indeed he showed himself to be a total pig. Treating Nicholson with only the greatest respect and dignity; while being utterly rude and ignorant to Duvall (Nicholson confirms this) to the point where she often broke down in to tears.(The little boy was protected by minders from the perfectionist.)Whether this was to help her performance I don't know - but I know that whether you are a star actor or tossing burgers at the local greasy spoon no one has the right to tear strips off you when you are trying your best.Kubrick might well have been a genius - although this is not the best evidence - but as a human being he left a lot to be desired. We might not see his like again, but at least future film sets will not fall foul of the Geneva Convention on Human Rights. As regards the film, watch and forget - although it might turn up in a few nightmares.",7,1,3,25 October 2004
American Beauty," Good entertainment - but the 'acres of meaning' passed me by!
","A Suburban Joe enters a mid-life crisis which involves quitting his well-paid job and starting an affair with a teenage girl.We all know that real tragedy is usually some medieval king deciding if he should wage war or make peace on his neighbour. A million miles away from the safe American suburbs where nothing actually happens - or does it?While the acting here is first class and the story is a bit witty and a bit kinky, I think people are going a bit overboard about it. Best Picture Oscar? Well that shocked me more than the film itself!Mid life crisis is one thing, but Spacey takes it to a Spinal Tap like '11' and then some. This should be a slapstick comedy really, but it takes a dark turning for reasons that I don't fully understand. Maybe this is what makes it such a critical winner - give 'em enough murk and they can see anything. People that are well fed, safe and healthy can be tragedies too?I almost want to crib other people's reviews on this one. I enjoyed it, sure, but where is the depth? What are people really enjoying here? What are the key points being made?Is it - as I suspect - people having safe, but boring, lives and looking on this movie as what would happen if they cut lose and went a little crazy themselves. But are very unlikely to do so. Does this film contain some kind of hidden suburban fantasy that I don't share?Is this film anti-monogamy? Or am I seeing things in the shadows and mist? Being single I have often viewed marriage as being a little boring - and the thought of a sexless marriage sends shivers down my spine. A personal view only, for all you married folk!Yes - liked it, but its classic status has to be explained to me more clearly. This is an urban black comedy and a bit different from the norm, but that alone doesn't make it all that special.",7,0,1,6 October 2004
Duck Soup," Lots of fun and memorable gags - with a few tasteless moments.
","The four Marx Brothers ride on to celluloid as a dictator (Groucho), a couple of unlikely spies (Chico and Harpo) and a guy that hangs around for no particular reason (Zeppo), but joins in the singing!I love the Marx brothers, but there are quibbles and short comings. For a start most of the major MB films were road tested as stage plays and the film makers didn't do enough to disguise this fact. While people praise the Bothers (plural) there is only one world class talent on show (Groucho) - the others are a leering creep (would you let Harpo near your child?), a pleasant but empty nothing (Zeppo), and an Italian stereotype (Chico - pronounced 'Chic-o' in family - due to his love of women, not the pronunciation normally used!) The problem with silly comedy is that it is unattackable as regards plot (how can you take anything seriously when opposing parties - in the film proper -  join for a singsong!), so anyone looking for in-depth political satire here will be disappointed. This is just a convenient setting for visual gags and various put downs of (and on) authority and - sadly - women in general.(This might be earliest film example of general bland statements being taken as sexual invitation!) Groucho/Firefly seems hell bent on having his war - as if the very concept of war is fun and should be treated with jest. At one point he fires a machine gun out of the window - but the people that he is gunning down turn out to be his own men (whoops)! Production code values were only introduced later (this is 1933) so there are a few innuendoes and even post-coitus bed scenes!Let me take a minute out to voice my general MB beefs: First Groucho never wrote any of the famous lines that came out of his mouth. Script writers did. They are often credited to him - even in serious quote books. Secondly they were never all that nice in real life. Chico viewed the chorus line of the shows as his own personal sexual play things and hung around with criminals (who took most of his money - through crooked gambling - and threaten to kill him unless he found more). Groucho wasn't called Groucho for nothing and, while master of the put-down, seemed bitter and twisted about money (no matter how much he had). He didn't take direction well (the painted mustache was a one-finger gesture to directors!) and as proof no director ever directed two Marx Brothers films!Returning to Duck Soup,  what do we have: well-rehearsed one-liners are aired, women are chased and bedded, silly songs are sung,  visual gags are aired (mostly pointless vandalism if you want to be pedantic) and war is presented like silly school boys playing in the school playground. Still it is the best Marx Brothers best film, not because it is perfect, but because it showcases what they had to offer the best.",9,0,2,2 April 2004
Apocalypse Now," Brilliant piece of bombastic self-indulgence that reduces the Vietnam War to a mere metaphor.
","*Smallish Spoilers*An 'errand boy sent by grocery clerks' is sent upriver to find a gone-mad Colonel Kurtz who has split with the US army and started his own private Vietnam War.(Crass tag-line from the official trailer - 'you may have been up river, but you have never been on a journey like this!') The gist of Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness has been plundered to tell a story about another time and another place (his book was set in Africa). The guy was dead by 1925, so presumably the slash-and-burn of his carefully worded novel was authorised via a spiritualist?Nevertheless the book has a purpose, plot and a climax; something that the real Vietnam lacked: A war started and waged by people who knew or cared little about Asia and couldn't even tell you - in a sentence - what they hoped to achieve by waging it! (Stopping internal Communism by military invasion is rather like trying to stop Italy being catholic at the point of a gun!)We all know the danger of war looking like fun and AN fights it by showing that you can't - in modern battle - really trust anybody. Friend or foe. Comedian Spike Milligan once joked that he had a hard WWII because he was 'shot at by both sides.' Lead Martin Sheen probably can identify with this joke! There are no scenes I actually dislike, but there is plenty that I don't understand. Famously Sheen appears out of water carrying a knife in full battle paint - but why? Because it looks clever? I also don't understand a lot of his actions anyway, especially towards the end - unless what he does is under a coverall of mental breakdown. I would also like a bit more explanation about Colonel Kurtz (Brando) and his background. I am told the Redux version has more footage set in the jungle camp - but I have never seen it. Isn't this a classic case of cinematography taken over from story? He has gone mad because mad wars send people mad. Isn't there time for further detail and explanation in a two and a half hour of film?(We are reduced to listening to a drugged out hippie - Dennis Hopper - for extra detail and insight!)We are lucky in having some fine actors on show to disguise the nonsense and the murk - including the memorable Robert Duvall down by the beach. He tells us that Napalm 'smells like victory,' while in reality it smells a lot like spilt petrol. They should have made AN a 'scratch and sniff' movie!(A horrible and desperate chemical weapon that dominated a horrible and desperate war. Destroying a country in order to save it!)The film was helped on its way to becoming a classic by being about depression, alienation and loneliness. Any poll of film shows (and IMDb is the biggest) shows these topics to be especially important. If marks count for anything. (The world loves a comedy or a musical - but look how rarely a comedy or a musical wins open film awards.)We have a great cast and we are on the road (or is it river?) to meeting the now late Marlon Brando - although we are really supposed to believe he is a character other than Brando. A Brando gone mad maybe? It can't be meant as a surprise because his image dominates the poster.Brando showed through his onset actions (which you can read about elsewhere) that he had no respect for director Coppola and no respect for the film.Yet he captures and dominates the screen like no American actor could or probably ever will again - bar, maybe, Orson Wells.At the end things blow up - not because it is in the script or was planned that way - but because the sets had to be destroyed and this was filmed. The Doors music plays against these images like a dream and you conclude that this is what death would really be like - if only death had taken lessons in drama and cinematography.",8,1,2,11 November 2004
Ocean's Eleven," Self-congratulating and preening crime thriller that is more style than substance
","An old-time con gets out of the can and comes up a grand master plan to rob a casino strongbox. But is it business or is it personal?
Movie makers are so short of ideas that they are prepared to remake movies that weren't very good in the first place? Having said that, this product belongs in the 'Star Is Born' mould of film: A frame to put your star product rather than anything special or unique by itself. All star cast? Well about six people here could be considered stars (Andy Garcia we will count as a falling star, Elliot Gould as well and truly fallen!) and even most of these look like overpaid extras. Matt Damon needs to be looking for more substantial roles than this - he is getting a bit old to be the wide-eyed tea-boy. I think Brad Pitt has a good set of washboard abs and a nice face, but has he ever convinced you that he is good at anything other than bench presses? Master thief - don't make me laugh. Julia Roberts isn't much more than a muse but does well enough with her well paid bit-part. Very dignified.
George Clooney has been lucky in life. Nice TV face that has been given a chance with movies because there isn't really anybody else coming along. While mediocre in mediocre material he is quite good with this type of light and throwaway material - understated and cool. That guy should market antiperspirant.We shouldn't go in to how they plan to turn over the casino given this is so much of the movie. However I am sure the casino security people wiped tears of laughter from their eyes watching things unfold.The security they have is unbreakable and criminals don't rob big vaults anymore - when was the last big robbery of this type? Besides they would simply kidnap someone important even if they were mad enough to give it a go. Sorry film makers - if you want to focus on crim's then small timers and drugs dealers are all you are left with.All faults to one side, this is quite an acceptable  little package, but there is something missing at the heart of it. Namely tension. I couldn't really care less if they got caught or not and frankly without this bank robberies become men-at-work movies.Good to see that while very few people have seen the (excellent) British comedy-drama Two Way Stretch (with Peter Sellers) the authors of this piece clearly have! It would be interesting to show the two films back-to-back to an audience and see which they preferred. I would bet on the low budget Brit-pic myself.",7,0,1,14 March 2004
The Usual Suspects," Entertaining enough thriller, but treats common-sense with reckless disregard.
","A group of criminals are brought in for questioning about a crime, but from the manner in which they are thrown together it is clear - even to the criminals themselves - that something is a-foot.A classic example of how different the world of film is to the world of literature. If this was a book the publisher would ask 'how drunk were you when you wrote this?' Thankfully film has music, acting (the best thing here) and special effects to distract the viewer. And this film does a fair-to-middling job. Here we have a film that doesn't so much contain holes, but is more one giant hole. However in this big hole we have various smaller holes! At an early stage one of the characters smells-a-rat, but carries on regardless! Excuse me, but if you want to present someone as a 'master criminal' this hardly helps your case!Credit other reviewers for going through the nonsense and holes on a blow-by-blow basis (although technically a spoiler); but achieving what is intended here, through the method employed, is as silly as anything I have seen in a serious film. Even if you think this film is great - and plenty do - you have to agree that it somewhat lacks real-world credibility. It may have a twist ending, but when you have confused the living daylights out of any sensible and logical person (and yes I do know flashbacks are not always the truth!) then a song and dance finale wouldn't have made any less sense.",7,1,1,11 September 2003
The Duchess," Spirited and stylish costume drama with heart and soul.
","A girl of nineteen (Georgiana Spencer Cavendish played by Keira Knightley) is to be married-off to an older titled man (The Duke of Devonshire played by Ralph Fiennes) as a form of provider-of-male-heir business arrangement (brokered by her mother - played by veteran Charlotte Rampling), rather than as a union based on true mutual love.Based - loosely - on a true historical story.(Parallels to the doomed marriage of Diane and Charles being played upon in the marketing and - in my opinion - in some of the acting on-screen!)I am a bit hesitant over costume drama. Too often the thing plays out like a fashion parade with too little moving central drama to keep my eyes from my watch. This isn't too bad, even though the mounting and costumes ARE still the only real prize winners on display. You feel that you are really going back in time. The well preserved mansions of England doing sterling service to the cause.To date this is KK's biggest - and most taxing - dramatic role and she handles it very well. A solid and polished performance without needing to clear her mantelpiece for awards. Although hard to believe that she is - later in the piece - a multiple-times-mother. She would have put on weight to play a rickets victim.Fiennes is better at playing not-very-nice than most actors and here he plays a man with little to no moral fibre. Indeed by today's standards someone for the Sex Offenders Register. Blame his over-privileged background and parents as much as him! Two previous films came to mind while watching: Barry Lyndon and Amadeus. Films with more money to spend and more plot to follow. This does not give the social context of these films although this might diminish sympathy for The Duchess. Who is - at worst - a frustrated and loveless bird kept in a gilded silver cage, rather than living in the disease, filth and poverty that the vast majority of the population had to endure way back then.",7,0,1,29 August 2011
Gone with the Wind," Sold gold work - then, now and forever
","The life and loves of a spoiled Southern rich girl living in fast changing timesHard to know where to start with a film of this sort and this magnitude, other than to say most of the things written about it are true. And given that whole books have been written about it - that is a hell of a lot of things.This David O Selznick produced movie not only became an event, but moved the whole art of cinema up to the level of great literature or painting. Even watching today you cannot help, but marvel at the casting, script or action. Despite what it has been boiled down to by its critics (an overheated civil war romance?), so much happens in this film that you could call it almost an action film.Great work is more about perspiration than inspiration. Here nothing has been left to chance, the leads (Gable and Leigh) are absolutely perfect for their roles - no one could have been better cast. Equally every smaller part has a major talent playing them. This maybe the best cast film of all time. Casting costs would make it impossible today.Yes - it is a woman's picture - and yes again - it has elements of soap opera about it. Watching three hours of anything can be hard work (some TV showings break it in to two parts), but it is well worth it.Despite not being in my own top ten of all time favourite movies (others simply appeal to me more), ignoring what this represents in terms of technical achievement and entertaining the masses/generations would be folly. Like it or not, Gone with the Wind moved the movie making bar up not inches, but whole feet and the cinema industry would be poorer for it never having been made.",9,2,3,23 April 2003
Wreck-It Ralph," Cobbled-together cliché-following script, but very entertaining nevertheless.
","Wreck-It Ralph is a video game bad guy (clearly modelled on Donkey Kong) who detests his life as a much-hated dump-living loner and longs to be, instead, a hero who saves the day and is loved-by-all. Better still have a shiny medal to hang around his neck. With this in mind he leaves his own game and seeks a medal in the other games in the arcade.(Naturally by doing so he puts the 'whole of video arcade in danger.')The internal logic of this cartoon doesn't really stand much scrutiny because video game characters don't have a life outside of their games and even if they did this is contradictory in the extreme. I suppose we have to suspend all our facilities as regards belief and logic, but why would a bad guy (created for the purposes of this alone) have a heart-of-gold? While this may be unimportant the film can't even decide on its own internal logic. Why would the characters die if the plug is pulled? Do they die if they have a power cut as well? Equally why didn't they die before they got to the arcade? (This is a movie written by people who don't know their ROM from their RAM?) For those old enough to remember eight-bit games and the early days of computing there are plenty of laughs and references. Q-bert was my favourite. Not a fan of shoot-em-ups generally and they play on screen worse than they do in any actual game. They just don't create any sense of danger. They are simply there to be shot and never seem to do anything to avoid being shot. They are about as menacing as wasps around a picnic.For my money it would have been more fun for Ralph to go in to loads of different games and interact with loads of our old favourites. Here he only lingers in two. Clearly this would have cost a lot more and, who knows, meant having to pay licensing. From the information about the film available here this was one of the original ideas.Ralph is quite a complex character in being a bit stupid (for laughs) one minute and quite cunning (for convenience) the next. I guess that a lot of dim characters are like this in movies, they have to serve the general plot and be whatever is needed. Worse the central character is such a bland retread of Shrek. John C. Reilly's voice performance is simply great though.The King Candy (Alan Tudyk) character seems to be indicating he is gay (lots of pink - sorry salmon - in the castle) and speaks with a bit of a camp lisp. While attacking some prejudices (the girl racers are all bitches ripe to be made good) it endorses others? He is a lot of fun though and adds a tiny bit of danger to a plot where nothing-bad-can-happen-and-we-all-know-it.Too cute and sharp tongued by-half Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) is a would-be racer who Ralph helps and is the co-central plot thread of the movie and while fun and entertaining, what follows is like watching somebody else's video game from over their shoulder.I guess the end message is go and see this film, enjoy it and think about the character references (if you know them), but don't start thinking about it too much. It really falls apart if you do. Strangely for a film about growth and change, the payoff is actually pretty weak. Like many cartoons and animated series the central message seems to be that everybody should know their place and be happy with it. Another cliché box ticked, sadly.",8,0,1,4 March 2014
Man on the Moon," Interesting and watchable portrait of a professional dysfunctional
","When Elvis died some wag said 'smart career move' and the same line can be borrowed for the subject of this film. Andy Kaufmann was half a good comedian -- half a weirdo so you could either laugh at him or with him (or not at all). You could even do a bit of both. His premature death allows him to be remember as a pioneer of alternative comedy rather than a cult performer who believed that simply by reversing expectation you could get a laugh or 'an experience' -- even if you were the only one laughing or having the experience! This bio takes the view that the real Andy was a bore and a loon and we spend most of our time looking at the on-stage version. The best and the worst of his gags that seem aimed to alienate any audience other than the doped-out college one (where there was never an empty seat according to this!) When he got voted off Saturday Night Live 'for life' that was what the US audience really felt about him -- a one joke crank that they were tired of. Not that he thought of himself as a comedian -- he never told jokes per se.Milos Foreman took on this project as part of his late 'sleeping' period and just lets the camera run and run from middle distance. Film other material like this and it would look like a TV movie. The technique of looking at members of the audience to underline reaction is overused. Every one of them -- it seems -- wearing a brightly coloured shirt with a big collar! Jim Carey is a natural for this type of material. He manages to look surprisingly like his target although he is a better and more rounded comedian. He is a first division comedian (he could sell out any venue in the world in minutes!) imitating a second division one. It would have been interesting to see a non comedian try and tackle the role and do all the stage business just to see how they would have coped. Or not.All comedians think up wild ideas and stunts (indeed we all do) but very few of us act on them. AK did act on those impulses and while some are funny (or interesting) others are gross and simply rude. Andy, death took your life, but it saved your reputation. Your best ever gag.",7,0,0,18 January 2006
Saving Private Ryan," Very good war movie - but too simple, straightforward and obvious to be regarded as a classic!
","A whole family of young men are killed on D-Day bar a front line solider (Private Ryan) who must be pulled back from the battle field for the sake of his poor mother.Steven Spielberg is a director that I feel is vastly over-rated. While I admit he has produced both classics (in artistic terms) and blockbusters (in commercial terms) is he really that good? Is he really able to rise above the budget, acting, technology or script? Does he believe in anything? Have a grand message for the world other than it is good to be rich and famous? A nice guy, sure, but so is my milkman.Call me a hard man to please, but I don't believe that Spielberg has put anything really new in the cinema pot and he has dipped in and borrowed plenty: Hitchcock, Scorsese, Kubrick and Kazan have all produced mini-masterpieces from nowhere with no stars or budget to speak of. Spielberg hasn't (although Juggernaut was above average for a TV movie).As has been said a thousand times before, the opening takes a first hand look at D-day and is quite brilliant, but when it ends the movie droops. It is then a bog-standard war-is-hell product with a lot of extra emoting and men-can-cry to show that we have turned the page. (Actually we haven't - many European films and B's have explored war from a first hand and more down-and-gritty viewpoint, but the mass audience haven't actually seen those products so they just think they are getting something new.)Tom Hanks is a great actor. He is the first and only modern star to play weak (or even stupid) and improve his box office standing. I praise him for it. No one could be better than him here, really bang on the money. But no one else needs to do much other than mouth words and Ryan (despite being the title role) is a star walk-on. I am glad I saw this film and I recommend it to you. But I wouldn't want to see it again no matter own it. Money has been well spent and its heart is in the right place, but at the end it wants to get you in a headlock and push emotions down your throat. Further proof - in my book - as to why Spielberg isn't really the master of his own game, just a little above average at it.",7,1,2,14 May 2004
The Pianist," Important and fascinating piece of work that I was made for all the right reasons.
","Roman Polanski is something of a genius for being in the middle of world history. Even if he had never made a film in his life his autobiography would still have been fascinating and history packed. I won't try and summate it in detail, but it involves an escape not unlike the one presented here on film! Having turned down Schindler's List (for reasons much noted elsewhere) he decides to make this as his tribute to the anti-Jewish horrors of WWII. Interesting.Despite the awards (all deserved) this is not what you might call a 'fat' film. It has one main theme: 'self preservation' in a world gone mad and that limits my sympathy and involvement. Indeed the protagonist (Adrian Brody) has something that people can envy even in his darkest hour - a great musical talent.The question I ask myself is how much of this lifesaver influences his decisions? While many gave up or joined in the resistance movement, Brody watches from the window: very much a curious and non Hollywood approach. Brave but not to everyone's taste.The real Warsaw Ghetto was featured in the great Granada documentary series 'The World at War' (quite frankly the most amazing piece of historical television ever created - if you can rent it do so) and nothing can be as shocking as the real pictures. However this is a close second.The early scenes of family life are like the scenes from the Titanic, we know what those on screen don't and we feel like calling out and warning them! In many ways the information is soft peddled and tokenised. We do not see the actual horrors of the death camps and even post war the survivors look too healthy to be believable. The only bum note in the entire movie.Although I had nothing to do with the making of this film I am proud of it. I am proud that millions of people have been educated and will continue to be educated about the horrors of war and what man does to man. But I didn't really enjoy it very much and I have no desire to see it again despite having some wonderful pieces of cinematography.",8,4,9,1 February 2005
The Transporter," Silly Hong Kong action thriller transported - for box office reasons - to the South of France.
","Given that politics and old age have side-tracked the last generation of action stars a search for new generation must proceed a-pace. Jason Statham was OK in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and a little better in Snatch (both directed by fellow Brit Guy Richie) so he is given the reluctant nod in this action no-brainer. The fact that he can do stunts helps too (although not all of them, unless he grew more hair while parachuting!) making him more than suitable for this nervous try out. Sadly he can't do the needed American accent to save his life!JS plays a strange 'no questions asked' transporter. The guy charges more than Federal Express, but Federal Express don't allow the transportation of girls in sacks with tape across their mouths. When our hero breaks his own rules and interferes with 'the package' all kinds of problems unfold.What we have here is - in all reality - a Hong Kong pot boiler with a bigger special effects budget. Sadly the script seems to have cost the same as it would down Sweat Shop Avenue and some of the dialogue is truly gut turning and terrible. Clearly the work of people that don't have English as their first language. However when it moves, it moves well, in a James Bond kind of way. The modern audience might not know it, but the quality of the stunts on display would have probably knocked the 1960's audience on to the cinema floor. How times have moved on!This product has nothing further to report on other than the fact that Taiwanese female lead - Oi Shu - is sexy beyond belief. Although the tape across her mouth does constitute something of an improvement...",5,0,1,14 December 2004
Lawrence of Arabia," The nearest thing to a perfect action film yet made.
","Circa World War One a low ranking British officer somehow manages to unite the rival tribes of Arabia to drive the Turks out of their yet unmapped country.Whether you like the work of David Lean or not you cannot begrudge him his chapter in cinema history. And note I said chapter and not page. While any review of a film is personal and depends on such factors as 'getting involved with the characters' you have to admire this for guts and determination alone.Scenes from this film go beyond the word epic, you feel that you are watching a documentary with no corner cut or no cost saved. Like all the great films you feel that you have gone through the experience rather than merely watched it. While O'Tool became an instant world star, plenty of respect goes to the mostly British support cast. There isn't a bad casting here everyone is perfect for their roles (bar Alec Guinness who is merely ok) and is giving it their all. If there is bum note or bad performance anywhere I didn't see it and special praise for Omar Sharif, his support work here is pin-sharp and perfect.The battle scenes are nothing less than some of the most perfectly realised pieces of cinema ever created. Quite frightening descends in to a world of carnage and madness that few of us - thankfully - will go for real.
There has to be a whole generation of people that have never seen it on the big screen and quite a number that have never seen the film full stop. Every city in the world should show this film in its full restored version to show what cinema can be when it gets it all totally right. It is one hell of an experience.What makes it all more amazing is that it manages to be both literate and insightful - especially in regards to how  much easier it is to unite on the battlefield than it is in the conference chamber. That self-determination is only possible if you wish to have self-determination and not let stupidity and anarchy rule. And more importantly, the lesson that has still to be learned: that the third world cannot be run by first world rules.This is David Leans best film by some way, it is almost frightening in the way that everything works and fits together. It has to soft peddle some of the imagery to get a family friendly certificate and the language might be a bit a lot milder than that used, but this has enough truth and truths to be used a history lesson - if you remember that all tellings of history are loaded and that includes important and respected history books.",10,0,2,11 January 2004
City of God," Believable and welcome South American life-in-the-ghetto diary, but ultimately too character cluttered, repeating and limited.
","The violent, and often shambolic, life and times of the Rio de Janeiro favela (or slum) told from the point of view of two contrasting former schoolboy friends. Filmed in the modern 'shaky hand-held camera' fashion to give it a documentary look-and-feel. (Something we will return to later.) The great problem with the English speaking mass cinema audience is that they rarely go anywhere abroad outside of tourist traps and have little interest in the Third World. Well outside of outrageous disasters - whether man-made or natural - which quickly slip from our TV screens or newspapers within days of their conclusion.Therefore when cinema takes a stroll down these new avenues it comes as a complete surprise to the virgin audience who get the full head trip. So Brazil is not all long beaches, endless samba beat and sexy girls in dental floss thongs? Well I didn't know that! Shock! Horror! Something must be done!(IMDb always seems to give a bonus mark for a new and different location - Cidade de Deus being only the latest recipient.)For most this product will be the only education about the Brazilian favela (slum) that they will ever get - but at least it is a believable portrait. Nevertheless it is not the last word on the subject and covers only limited ground. Indeed it is a classic example of a film that starts well - loses its way in the middle section - before it arrives at the only climax (and closing impression) which is conceivable. A bit more social context about Brazilian class society would have been welcome - but maybe the budget didn't run to it. Not travelling back in time. This film's idea of background detail is a lone period car! We needed the 'other Brazil' - but, baring a few voice-over references all we get is a few token scenes in a supermarket or in a newspaper office.(The media types are shown as friendly, warm and caring in perfect contrast to the police who are shown as being totally corrupt. Almost on a parallel to the gangsters. I wonder which camp the writer comes from?) This film has been compared to Goodfellers, and I can see why, but it isn't really in its league. If anything it is a home movie version of the Scorsese classic and needs constant voice-over and subtitles in order for it to make sense. Even with it I was lost several times, but that may have been trying to keep track of too many characters that looked - because of the passing of time - nothing like they did when first introduced!The plot is curiously male orientated when sex is not involved. Do these gangsters not have mothers, sisters, social workers, teachers or sensible relatives? The types that crop up in 40's Warner Brothers gangster pictures to give balance to the criminals and their life views. Overall the script spends too long in the gang hut with the venom-spitting hoods who alternate only between loading weapons and smoking dope. There is no real conventional acting in this movie, there is no need for it. Ducking, diving, shooting guns and looking scared is not that hard. Yes it convinces, but stupid/reckless/desperate Third World people are hard to pin down, how can you say anything is wrong? They march to a different drum.Here leadership seems awarded for recklessness as much as brains, but they have nowhere to go and little to say. Why should they? They have no education. There is only one business (drugs) and there is only one punishment for those that go against the interests of that business.(Once you establish life is cheap and taken on a whim, you don't need to go there again unless it is essential or part of the grand climax.)I am not all that fond of hand-held camera work. It allows you run around and this only results in lots of scenes of people running around. This establishes it as a real location, but doesn't really add any sense of composure. There are times when I feel I was running with the gang as part of it - while I really wanted to be a cold and distant condemning witness. Yes there is lots of questions, quibbles and short comings, but it is a powerful and thought provoking film. But it rather suffers from the Holocaust syndrome: It is hard to criticise the film without seeming to attack the honourable subject. Maybe director Fernando Meirelles has something - he certainly includes some masterful scenes here - but the limited characters overstay their welcome. I wouldn't want to watch it again.",7,2,4,26 December 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," The ultimate battle between sense and silliness
","I always have time for films that dare to be different and that faith was stretched to the limits with CTHD. The story is set in feudal China and centres around an ancient (even then!) sword that is stolen by person(s) unknown.Real star of the show is Ziyi Zhang who comes across as a kind of young female Bruce Lee, although somewhat aided by the ability to defy gravity - director Ang's claims that she could not fly, but perform great leaps and falls!(Sorry Lee - I know flying when I see it!)The film starts with a murky and talky set-up that introduce us to the three principle characters played by Chow Yun Fat,   Ziyi Zhang and Michelle Yeoh. From their talk-talk it seems they have all acquired mystical living and fighting skills although I would not be like to explain the full in-and-outs of it!Thankfully the silly talking stops and  movie starts to kick-off in earnest when  Zhang is kidnapped on the way to her marriage of convenience. This is where the film really works (as an action movie) and indeed some of the set pieces are classics, although aided and abetted by skilful fly-by-wire work.I don't understand is why the script wasn't re-written to make the characters background  clearer, their skills highlighted (is Zhang hitting with normal powers for someone of her height/weight or superhuman powers?) and then get the whole show on the road earlier. Maybe I missed a few things while dozing through the slow opening, but I could have done with a bit more help with what follows.The actors all put in solid performances, although only the doll-faced Zhang climbs above the script. Fat seems to be billed as star of the show - perhaps because he is the only recognised actor - but he features only in passing. Equally curious is that his love for stunt-happy Yeoh seems understated, but perhaps that is the Oriental way?Plenty of plus points for having strong females characters that hold their own in all aspects of life, but the mystical soup doesn't deliver anything like the classic  some people think they are seeing. The real battle in this movie fights isn't between good and evil, it is between sense and silliness. Sense wins wins in the end, but it is a close call...",7,1,2,28 September 2002
Velvet Goldmine," Cheapo jog through the few highs and many lows of glam rock
","A story based on the rise and fall of glam rock, focusing on the disappearance of a once famous rock star.What a mess of a movie, nostalgia for a drugged-out age where second rate artists with bright clothes and bi-sexual attitudes took over the pop scene. If you thought the real thing was poor just wait until you hear the impersonations you get here!Star Jonathan Rhys Meyers looks a bit like David Bowie (only has blue hair not red) with his pale face and hollow look, but can't carry the movie. Christian Bale should have got the part, but settles for a role as a chasing journalist that doesn't stretch him. Comedian Eddie Izzard has the best role as a manager and the film droops every time he is off screen. Ewan Gordon McGregor does nothing with his Iggy Pop style role other than show off like he is in front of the bathroom mirror.What a half-baked shambles of a movie, long scenes in half light and the performance of songs that the band at your local youth club could top. A film so sloppily made that cars drive on the left even in America!Glam rock is too recent to have a nostalgia film made about it - the should have left it another two or three thousand years at least.",5,1,6,16 January 2004
Good Will Hunting," James Dean buys a pocket calculator.
","A rebellious young college janitor (Matt Damon)  is secretly a maths genius, but even when it is uncovered, he seems reluctant to use it to better his life.A film that is billed as 'highly original' is nothing of the kind. It merely lifts from a wide variety of diverse movies from Saturday Night Fever through Rocky to Love Story.  However it owes more to Ordinary People (the film best remembered - or is it forgotten!? -  for  robbing Raging Bull of the Best Picture Oscar!) than any other.Hard to really believe the central character who seems to have read lots of books and done a lot of studying off-screen (how, why and when are not fully explained). On-screen he seems much more interested in fighting on street corners, shouting at his working class friends (even when they are sat next to him), and getting clever-clever with authority.Good performance from Matt Damon in the central role, but Robin Williams as the psychiatrist who helps him (and who himself ends up helped), is the standout. Here is guy who can say more with a look than most actors can do with a hundreds lines of dialogue. Shame that even the academics seem  to swear just as readily and just as often as those lower down the food chain.Mini Driver is quite touching as an English student (rich - but not a bitch!) who catches our hero's eye. While bringing dimension to the movie, you get the feeling that this was included in case the rest of the plot flopped. It wouldn't take too much editing to make this the central theme with the rest being the background. However this was not needed.Too many good moments and too much of an engaging plot for us not be lightly charmed - but I wasn't moved by this movie. Our hero's working class friends are loyal - but that is about all you can say for them. Ben Affleck (in the 'best friend' role) shows that haircuts, cheekbones and teeth are still what really counts in tinsel town. The sterile world of (Boston) academia and the juvenile world of the street (as portrayed here) both alienated me. Can there not be middle way for our will-he-won't-he protagonist? The movie seems just as confused on this point as I am and in the end cops out of answering it.",7,6,10,28 April 2003
Driven," Cocktail of sports clichés, violence and rock bombast.
","Hot shot young driver gets the help of a veteran to try and win the world drivers championship.A film that crashes (in more ways than one) from unintentional farce (check out the scene where the racing cars are driven at full speed through urban streets!), to the unbelievable (the final race is an all-time prize winner!) to clichés like a roller coaster from hell. Not just bad, but probably as bad as any big budget movie made in the last ten years. In fact its badness would make it entertaining if it were not so utterly irresponsible.It presents horrific crashes (certainly the kind that would result in death in real life - here I am not sure of anything!) as a form of entertainment, lingering on the twisted and flying debris in slow motion. Then having crashed and burned, the film shrugs its collective shoulders, pops another rock track on the old soundtrack jukebox and gets on the with rest of race!(What goes on in the minds of the people that come up with this soulless junk? Do these people ever think about what they are saying or showing?)This is the final product of the soulless and the dehumanised; but more crucially still,  the desperate. People that think that marrying clichés to pyrotechnics (what is actually exploding anyway???) makes for entertainment. Thank god this  film was a box office flop and has a low  IDB rating. I wouldn't want to live in a world where this witless stinker was hit...",2,1,2,30 April 2003
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Leaves you with more of an aching bottom than an aching heart
","A tale is spun of a blind clock maker who makes a large public clock which runs backwards. A symbol of forlorn hope that his son can return home from a war in which he died. Later a baby is born, but with the features of an old man. For Benjamin Button - played by Brad Pitt - time will really run backwards.I haven't read the F Scott Fitzgerald short story, but I might. Could well be better than this film and secondly it might fill me in on the clues, meaning and motivations that passed me by (or the makers could not convey clearly).First a word on the acting: Pitt received an Oscar nod (not win) for this, but does he deserve it when most of the acting is imposed by CGI or make-up? Indeed the central problem in casting is that Pitt (today) is not really all that young. So a lot the supposed 'young man' scenes had to be filmed in medium shot.(If you think he is not a gym-toned forty something - at his youngest point - you shouldn't be giving descriptions to the police!) While there is plenty going on there is also a lot of meaningless padding. He meets a former long distance swimmer at a hotel in Russia, but I have no idea why this means anything. And given the screen time it must - at least to the various authors.The 'old' BB acts young (because he is in his own mind!) and confuses himself and others, but there is no answer and no solution. His life is bizarre and he has no role model or no way of making sense of it. So - in time - he quietly accepts.Naturally long-term sexual happiness cannot be achieved as you get younger to a partner who is getting older. Indeed at some point you might risk being arrested and put in jail!Yes, there are loads of unique dilemmas and crossroads, but Button just runs out of the kitchen every time it gets hot. There is no dealing with it. Equally meeting people that he left when he appeared older (now as a younger appearing self) is dealt with in a matter-of-fact way. Why would they believe it was the same person? Anyone sane would be totally disbelieving!The movie having one big central novelty seems to be a license to follow the road of cliché in most other areas. The romance here ticks every box which was laughed at in the Naked Gun series. The romance montage where they laugh and clown, practical joke and roll like thunder (in the hay) is so old hat that you think they are taking the Mick!Thankfully the act direction is simply first class. Yes lots of stuff made on a computer - including a ballet rehearsal where Tilda Swinton's face has been morphed on to another dancer! Every shot is well framed and thought out. Creates a true sense of being in the past.(And while I am on the subject, Tilden is shown dancing vigorously and later seen stretching. You stretch before you dance - not after!) There is solid acting from the full cast - with special mention to the classy Tilden as the love interest - but I don't understand her particularly well either. While Pitt has a pretty face and six-pack you need more than that to entertain an intelligent career woman for long. BB is weak and totally empty. A drift through life chancer who, as I said before, always runs when things get tough.Three hours is too long to spend with him. He is not worth this extended length of celluloid. Glad I saw it though. If only for the art direction and cinematography.",6,1,2,2 September 2011
Lincoln," Worthy, but ultimately dull and draggy, portrait of a great American icon.
","President Lincoln has two things in his mind and on his plate. Bringing to an end the costly and bloody civil war and find a way to pass the 13th Amendment: In broad effect, to end all slavery on American soil.It seems churlish to summate any great (in the sense of important or historically relevant) statesman in a paragraph. Like trying to summate the impact of The Beatles in such a couple of lines. A film has to do something similar in under two and a bit hours. A bit more room for doubt and complexity and ambiguity, but essentially not much.Besides, very few films can survive or be a success where the central character isn't a hero. Or at least a flawed hero. This is a film of selected facts and even some bizarre fictions.(Why are the details of the final deciding vote wrong?) Here we have a very modern Lincoln who sees blacks as equals and is moved to tears by the sight of men in chains. Or at least he says he was. Strange that he later wanted to export freed slaves to other lands where their conditions would be similar. Maybe it was the actual seeing it that he objected to? A film is allowed to have an opinion that isn't mine. To take as fact what may be only interpretation or biography. That is fair enough, but to carry a morality film the central character has to be seen as - at heart - fair minded. A man who would be the right thing, even at personal cost. Reading his own words doesn't lend me to think that. Indeed he seemed to believe that the future America would become be formed as part of an apartheid system. Mixed marriages to be outlawed.(And maybe they would have been if Lincoln had lived long enough!)Politicians have stayed the basically the same since the dawn of time. Two faced, corrupt, self-serving and deceitful. They understand only two thing: Themselves and money. Using this information most things are possible now and then. There isn't any subtlety in this story, the politicians were simply bribed for their votes. So much for democracy or even an interesting storyline.The best thing here is Daniel Day-Lewis. Indeed he saves the film from being unwatchable. What fantastic acting it must be to keep a straight face while a grunting front-line soldier recites the Gettysburg Address from memory! Doesn't matter how many years you work on a script (Tony Kushner), doesn't mean you won't come up with cripplingly bad scenes like this! After a modestly interesting opening - including some basic battle scenes - we are in the smokey and half-lit rooms where corrupt politicians and lobbyists do their dirty work. To be frank I was soon bored with it all. But it just goes on-and-on in the gloom.In a crass finish the final vote is played like a big game with close-ups of faces and the gnashing of teeth. All we need is an excitable commentator on the PA. We (those who don't generally live in caves) know what is going to happen so there isn't even any intrigue or tension.Spielberg has made some great movies and some great flops, but I'd rather sit through one his flops (1941?) again then sit through this all over again.",5,0,2,24 February 2014
Mulholland Drive," Great opening moments, but self-indulgence and audience disrespect take over!
","On the outskirts of Los Angeles a car accident results in a stunning young woman wandering the neighbourhood suffering from amnesia. Hiding in a bush she takes the chance to enter the apartment house of a departing stranger.David Lynch is a name that you almost have to pause after saying. He comes with more baggage than Elton John on a short skiing trip! While the man has something having (in my opinion) produced two great movies in The Elephant Man and Wild At Heart - and some others that are not at all bad. However he is in an extended period of disintegration and decay.His direction of Dune (a simple action movie that Lynch treated like it was a talk piece!) made his name in to an industry joke. Careers have been ended for less. Naturally he blamed others!I am a believer that the audience should have half a chance of understanding what is going on. At least things should be explained (hinted at even!) later. Lynch doesn't. I am not saying all cinema has to be linear, indeed many great movies are from that, but we deserve our chance because it is our money he wants (and don't tell him he doesn't because he tells interviewers that he is a staunch capitalist Republican).The story of how this film came from a junked TV series is actually clear from the length of one the actresses hair. It wouldn't grow that much in the course of any movie shoot! TV execs wouldn't pick it up for a reason, the reason being that you have to know what you are buying - how could they be anything other than confused? Only French (the people that think Jerry Lewis is a genius remember!) money saved the day.This world is full of movies and the fact that this is mediocre isn't anything unusual. The tragedy is that this could have been a classic with more control and better editing. The opening is really quite excellent and I hoped that Lynch had learnt his lesson and could keep it going, but no, he gets bored with it and starts his weirdness for the sake of weirdness trip. It isn't even original weirdness just bits culled from previous products.As we reach the end Lynch has decided that we don't even have to see what is going on and the soundtrack goes muddy at some points too. These things would be considered amateurish in other people's products, but skimmed over in the minds of many friendly critics. Before I try and solve a puzzle I have to believe that the puzzle is worth solving. This movie that isn't worth solving because no matter how much work you put in, I am sure I would find parts left over. There is no answer only theories.I am sad that the chance of a great movie has been wasted rather like a man stranded on a dessert island that has chopped up a boat to make a raft out of it. He prefers a raft to a boat - but should he be applauded for it?",6,2,5,13 March 2004
8 Mile," Mediocre, but I expected far worse.
","A young factory hand wants to become a rapper - but he is handicapped by being poor and white.All right, cards on the table. I don't like Eminem. Well, in truth, I think he is a bit of a moron. I also don't like rap much either. So I guess I didn't come to this movie with much hope for it - but you know, it is not that bad. Not that good either, but for a star vehicle it is not at all bad. I expected much worse. A modern Elvis movie, maybe.This is a film from the put-filters-on-the-camera and wobble-it-a-lot school. Makes it look like a documentary and, therefore, more real. Or so the propaganda goes.There isn't a lot of originality here, but it is at least a good taste stealer. Rocky and the Karate Kid spring to mind. The thing that surprises is that Marshall Bruce Mathers III (Em') is cool and collected before the camera. A bit one-note, but not a bad first try. Maybe his secret is that he couldn't care less about how he looks or acts - like the way he says things to offend people in his lyrics.Wrong-side-of-the-tracks Detroit looks like the slum it really is and the support characters look real enough too. If only the central music was any good it might please this over 40 - but it doesn't. Doggerel verse is no big deal and besides - where has rap gone in twenty years? Nowhere! Rock has taken some of its tricks, but rap remains dumb and stuck. Guys moaning and about their lot and girls they would like to have sex with.There might be a sequel - and if this makes enough money there is bound to be - but I won't be watching. This was plenty for me. There are enough pros behind the scenes to keep this going to the end, but there is little to really make it essential viewing. Even for a hardened rap fan.",6,0,2,21 September 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Designer violence festival from the bucket-of-blood school of film making.
","A woman - with a past in a cartoon style assignation squad - is left for dead on her wedding day and vows the path of bloody revenge.The thing that hard-line critics and hard-line lovers of this movie both agree on is there is no real story here and - more bizarrely - little of the Ping-Pong dialogue that the director (Quentin Tarantino) made his name with. Maybe the fact that the movie was sliced in half is part of the problem - until I actually see Part II I will have to reserve judgement.To date QT has made one great movie (Pulp Fiction); a very good movie (Reservoir Dogs); and a very average movie (Jackie Brown.) You can see the direction this paragraph is going already - because this is below average. Hong Kong Fuey was made on the cheap for an initial audience that didn't have the education or the appetite for much thinking - why celebrate it on a big budget? What is that all about? It is like filming a hardcore porn film with the budget of the movie Titanic!(There is a movie called 'I Spit On Your Grave' that was about an abused woman taking revenge on her abusers. Chicago Times'es Roger Ebert thought it was the worst movie he had ever seen (it is dreadful true). This has pretty much the same plot, but has more killing, blood and sadism - but he gives it top marks. Confused? I certainly am!)Lead Uma Thurman - here called only The Bride - confuses me as an actress and a person (married/divorced/married/children/divorced all before 30) and is a little strange looking with her model legs ending with massive policeman's feet. Yes she can act a bit, but like Lauren Bacall (who she most resembles) if the script is bad so is she and vice versa.UT is the best thing in this, although I don't believe her for one second.When you carry a fully grown guy on the end of a sword (as if!) wouldn't it buckle your knees a bit darling? Tarantino is in love with her in the classic Hitchcock mode and fashion. He knows he is too ugly and dorky to get in to her pants through natural means so he uses the casting couch and excuse-to-be-with approach. Well done, but it is all a big lie and we both know it. Given her fast turn over record on men there isn't much future in it either.QT fails because he is tasteless and doesn't have a natural censor to call upon. More is often less. He oversteps the mark and loses control on most films he makes and here he gets plain silly. There is no other word for it. We linger on a woman squirting blood from a severed arm - but we linger for no reason other than to give the audience a cheap thrill and the less said about the 'comedy' rape the better.There is a lot of sword fighting and severed limbs in this movie - so much so that you are sick to death of it before our semi-climax (we only get to the half way point, remember!), which is more of the same only bigger.Like having a three course meal made up of the same dishes over and over again.Tarantino is smart in knowing how to fit music to scenes (often obscure pop) and how this lets us linger for little reason on people doing nothing much more than walking down a corridor. He is a good introducer and while avoiding some clichés he celebrates others. Hong Kong cinema can do no wrong in his eyes.To his credit he has not repeated himself in any of his efforts but this is an experiment gone wrong and the high marks and good reviews shows that more people are closet sadists than I would have imagined. Maybe that is too harsh a term, it is more like the scene in the school playground when the school bully is beating the living crap out of someone and everyone is circling round thinking it is great and urging them on because it isn't them on the receiving end. Tarantino makes you one of those people - and I don't like it.",6,3,7,1 October 2005
The Last Emperor," Great art, great vision, but not great film entertainment.
","The life and times of Pu Yi, the boy Emperor of China whose life-of-destiny was overtaken over by the Chinese Cultural Revolution.This is one of the most difficult movies I have ever had to review because, while I cannot ignore the majestic flow and vision of the film and the man mountain of film awards, I also cannot also ignore my own heart and aching bottom. While I can quote clichés about the 'meaning of film' all day long, I believe that all movies (whatever the aims and nature) should be enjoyable while watching them and you shouldn't be glad when the final credits roll - indeed you should be sad!Bernardo Bertolucci believes that cinema is mostly vision and atmosphere - and believe me he is master of his limited focus - but there is also a need for a story. Something that passes him by. If we are lucky a story that changes pace, informs, excites and thrills.This film has moments that will stay in the memory forever and when I first saw them as TV clips I thought 'this is going to be something else - an epic.' However they are simply impressive props and backdrops for a story that would be better told as a documentary. The film opens up on the story of a little boy born with a destiny. Not many people are born with a destiny outside of royalty and they should be treat with sympathy because, while they may seem fated, they also live in a gilded cage. Even if history had not taken over events Pi would have lived a life of quiet impotence - despite the title he would have had no powers and would have had no influence on his countries' affairs. A living and breathing statue. The revolution probably did him the best favour that he ever had.I always think that a life spent on holiday is most intelligent person's version of hell. A life spent on holiday while trapped inside a prison camp must be the worst. Filming took place in the real Forbidden City, but I am not that impressed by it. It could have been built in a studio and we would not have known. Vast amounts of money have been spent and it is all up there on the screen, but that, by itself, doesn't really impress me.I won't go through the changes in the Emperor's life on a stage-by-stage basis (as so many have done) because that would take away some of few things that will carry you through the (very long) movie.It is a comment on the nature of this film that people are quite happy to explain it scene-by-scene as if this doesn't take away anything from it. It does and frankly does a disservice to the film or maybe this is one of these 'great art pieces' in which such spoiler rules don't apply.Bernardo Bertolucci is pretty overrated as a director and as a story teller he couldn't work on TV. He is a bit of a fossil in that he takes hours to say what could be said in five minutes. The acting is steady, and in Peter O'Toole we have excellence, but I couldn't get inside anybody - they either had a brown nosing or duty-to-do role and no-one is really allowed to be themselves. The acting is - in the main - cold and seems swamped by the oriental mysticism that the director wants us to bath in.This is an important film and well worth seeing, but I wasn't entertained and after the opening - which looks at a unique childhood - I became bored and restless. Usually childhood is most boring part of any biography and the story usually picks up when they take up the sword of whatever made them famous. Here we have boy/man on the road to nowhere or nothing. A sad tale of a boy/man who seemed to have everything but in fact had nothing.Sorry, I was left with a numb brain and a numb bottom - and I didn't even see the 'long' version! To borrow a very famous review line 'there is so much to admire here that I only wish I could have liked it more...'",6,9,23,22 September 2004
Black Hawk Down," Masterclass on the desperate and ugly nature of urban warfare
","A US helicopter crashes in the third world and a chain reaction ensues. Based on a true story. I usually don't like war films because far too often they are gratuitous and pointless, but what we have here is not just a good film, but a classic war film. Indeed something that can be put alongside Platoon, Saving Private Ryan and A Bridge Too Far.(While the above are not among my favourite movies they give us a good insight in to what other people had to go through on our behalf. A place that you hope fate doesn't drop you sometime in the future.)Usually you criticise films for their chaos and lack of overall clarity, but here the moments of confusion and ambiguity are appropriate. When you watch it first time you can enjoy (if that is the right word) the ride, when you watch it the second time you can see the detail and structure. Director Scott brings us in to the movie through angles and emotions (the stone cold war room trying to figure it all out like a chess game versus the grunt in the line of fire), to the point where we are ducking with the actors as the flack comes our way. (Some of the scenes set to music are just strangely beautiful. Soldiers running for their lives to wailing middle-eastern music haunted me for days after seeing it. There is no real reason for it - in the telling of a story - but the image and the music somehow work magic.)  The soldiers mission is simple to comprehend: Let us try and complete our mission and then get out of here alive; but there is a real sense of the honour and bravery that has to make up a modern army. You have to know that if the worst happens, no expense will be spared to try and save you. This isn't just Hollywood - it is true.This is a message film whose message is only just being understood: that well intentioned actions can go horribly wrong and no matter what your technological superiority there has to be a price to pay: and the everyday soldier is the person likely to pay that price. A film that can be enjoyed as a simple action piece or as a message picture; or if you smart enough a combination of both. One of these films that - while hardly unregarded now - could grow-and-grow until it becomes an all-time classic. I guess it all depends on how world history plays itself out and how common situations like this become.",8,0,0,5 December 2003
Annie Hall," A masterpiece of sentimental urban comedy
","A New York comedian and a Midwestern girl have a brief Summer affair.Living proof that the best films are about nothing, this won the Oscar awards for picture (the only time this has been given to a comedy), script and direction. Maybe modesty prevented the Academy from giving Allen the award for best actor too - although he was nominated. Co-star Diane Keaton won the Best Actress award largely on the strength of the material.The world-class wisecracks of Allen make the thing worthwhile by themselves ('don't knock masturbation it is sex with someone I love') and the fact that Allen (the director) feels he can do anything from subtitles (giving his secret thoughts) to going back in time to revisit his own childhood. He is like a stage magician, we sit not knowing what tricks he is going to pull next, applauding because his tricks are not only a surprise, but often fantastic too.To complicate the matters even more, Allen and Keaton once had a brief affair (which ended before filming started) and we are left wondering if some of the scenes are not autobiographical. It all seems to make the soup that bit thicker and spicier.Like Dickens, Lennon and Shakespeare, Allen is an author visited by genius in being able to make the everyday and mundane in to something epic. I can't explain it (certainly not in a paragraph or two), but I am glad it is there. There is 93 minutes of film in Annie Hall, but there isn't one moment of boredom or scene that falls flat. 
When you pair this with Manhattan (a companion piece to this) you have Woody Allen at the peak of his film making powers, producing material that people will be enjoying a hundred years from now. The real tragedy is that so few films are this good and the present day Allen has passed his peak; but I live in hope that I see another comedy that delivers as many down-to-earth laughs and insights in my lifetime.",9,0,0,23 April 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," Very memorable - but puzzling and limited.
","A space mission aims to discover the meaning of transmission from the moon.How many lines have been written about this film? More importantly how many finished in question marks? Because this is a film that prefers to ask questions rather than answering them. The cinema of the imperfect, if you will.You can imagine the confusion this film must have created on release (in 1968) and it is easy to see why many didn't like it and many more stayed away. Indeed I only half like it - having actually seen it twice.Kubrick did a lot of his own cinematography and while he listened to others they rarely changed his mind. He was a film dictator, but like many great art dictators we should be grateful because other collaborators would have only left the mark of mediocrity.Do we criticise Beethoven for not collaborating with fellow composers or decry that Dylan didn't write in collaboration with a journeyman? (I would put Kubrick up with both of the above as an artist. As a man I wouldn't rate him higher than a junkyard dog.) This film may have the greatest span of time of any movie, but it is very limited. Space is a boring place says this film. Long, drawn out, nothing much of interest happens. What is interesting is man and machine - and maybe what they will find out. Although we get a lot a drum roll and very little fireworks.The classic music and the visuals are bombast that probably look fantastic on the big screen, but look a little silly on the small. To deafen and to blind are actually without skill and are little more than a carnival stunt.What I like about this film is that it fights emotions rather than plays upon it. Death matters little and the whole feel is cold and frigid. It hardly leads one to want to go in to space (as millions would like) nor put your life in the hands of machines.The sets are stunning and stand up well today, even after so much has happened to make space exploration a reality. Indeed the dwarf the humans and lead Keir Dullea is a lesson in non acting anyway.Every generation of film fan will see this film at least once, so there is nothing left for us to fight for, but I prefer films with a bit more of a story and less of feeling of self-importance based on spending vast amounts on the sets.",7,1,3,15 September 2005
The Graduate," Lightweight comedy-drama with end-of-the-sixties values and music
","A middle class college leaver returns home to start his new life, which involves having an affair with a much older married women.Too many landmarks and notables to pretend this isn't an important film, but new viewers may find that the hype more interesting than what appears on the screen. Like Woodstock, you didn't have to be there, but you needed to have been around at the time to fully understand.As is much noted elsewhere, the film plays out its best  tricks very early and we have a long yawn before we get to the memorable climax. The Paul Simon music helps us through the more draggy parts though and started a trend of using pop music to illustrate pregnant pauses.While Hoffman plays out many a youngman's fantasy, the whole thing comes off as limited and boring (sex yes - but not sexy!) Bancroft - as the seducing Mrs Robinson - is a lesson in non acting and is basically charmless. While a very good actress (especially on the stage), she seems to have a natural cold streak which comes through in all her films. Even for a women over thirty (Hoffman and Bancroft's real ages are closer than you think!) casual sex would be easy to come by. Why would a woman need to be involved with someone for sex that they otherwise had no interest in? Bancroft won an Oscar nomination for basically doing nothing but being enigmatic. And that is not to say unbelievable.While well remember and regarded, this film is more about Dustin Hoffman not having to do any more dish-washing and script writers not having to worry about including casual sex than making any breakthroughs. In fact it is only a boy-meets-girl story, spun out to  include the mother too...",7,1,3,24 April 2003
This Is Spinal Tap," Good laughs for music lover and insiders.
","Mockumentry about an ageing British rock band returning to play a series of gigs in the USA.One of these movies that never set the world on fire upon its release - how many people saw it in a cinema? - but through video and TV has become a cult and maybe even a classic.It represents a lot of little gags about tastelessness, musicians on-the-road and people in forced marriages, but most of all it  takes the rip out of heavy metal and all those 'has anyone seen my socks' on-the-road documentaries; although it is alleged (by director Rob Reiner) that some people don't realise that this is a joke!There is no need to do any market research about humour. Either you laugh or you don't.  The amps that go up to '11' is  my favourite. You have to watch it twice to catch some of the dialogue (worth checking out on this site) and see how the running gags sit together.(The fate of the various drummers is a gem.)The music itself is actually not that much better or worse than real B league rock and the only real spark of musical  inspiration is the 'flashback' to Spinal Tap in the sixties. The central theme is 'tastelessness' in words and music; although this is hardly new or original.Yes, this film is funny and memorable - with one or two gems - but the thing that you are left with is a lot of mini sketches, stretched around a framework of familiarity. The theme of  musicians being narcissistic, egotistic, tasteless and dim has all been done before, just not as well or with the correct budget.The final thought is how music and comedy are alike. Both can be enjoyable and make the world a better place, but you rarely learn anything or gain anything. They are both about enjoying a few moments of inspiration and talent, before moving on to things that really matter....",7,4,10,15 April 2003
Chariots of Fire," 'The movie wouldn't be much without the Vangelis soundtrack,' David Puttnam, COF producer.
","Two British athletes have ambition for gold at the 1924 Olympics in Paris, but have personal as well as track problems to overcome.The purpose of a movie is to capture your attention and our emotions. A quick vox pop of IMDb reviewers shows that this is a movie that draws strong negative emotions as well as strong positive ones. You have every right not to like any work of art, but you have to acknowledge that the general audience prefers cheap thrills to thinking.This doesn't even feature a real villain - no matter drugs, sex or violence!Yes it might not be to everyone's taste, but COF is one of those movies that could not be really improved upon given its targets, intentions and budget. It is not a perfect, but it is perfectly realized.The film tries to wrap itself around events that are broadly true, but it also shows that real life - however outstanding - doesn't always help the dramatist. Abrahams (Ben Cross) is shown being persecuted and haunted for being a Jew, while there is no evidence of it, indeed he became an authority figure later without objection from anyone. Even the romance portrayed here actually happened years after the film ended! Meanwhile Liddell (Ian Charlson) is a dedicated man-of-god who won't compete on a Sunday (that is true - although facts around this are NOT as explained here!) Sadly that is also the day of the 100 yard (sic) final. A bit of a two dimensional character, in his dedication to 'doing god's work', but a true sportsman and also a rugby international (mentioned only once in passing). He later died an early death for his beliefs.(Curious that the actor convincingly playing him should take the opposite path and died young too!)Anyone that wants a lesson in how important a musical score is to a movie should view this. The Evangelos Odysseus Papathanassiou (that is his real name!) title track is a 'hairs-on-the-back-of-your-neck' classic - although, curiously, the electronic music is totally out-of-time with the period the film tries to evoke!The strangest thing about this film that I wasn't really that impressed with it the first time I saw it. However with repeat viewings I liked it more and more, to the point in which I would put it in my own personal top ten of all time. Great sports movies are rare and while I am both British and a sports fan I am sure that people who are neither can enjoy this film as well. Raiders of the Lost Arc was an enjoyable film, but it was also a cartoon and cartoons can't win Best Picture Oscars - it isn't right.So it isn't in the top 250 of all-time movies? So people don't like it? But who has seen the 'better' Die Hard twice and seen more in it the second time? This did good business at the box office world-wide, it won awards (including the big one), the soundtrack works like a dream and there is some classic scenes and an uplifting climax. Everything a film should be and the best of the 1980's for me.P.S The title refers to a line in the hymn Jerusalem by William Blake (1757-1827) which explores the obscure theory that Jesus once visited England.'And did those feet in ancient time Walk upon England's mountain green? And was the holy Lamb of God On England's pleasant pastures seen? And did the countenance divine Shine forth upon our clouded hills? And was Jerusalem builded here Among those dark satanic mills?Bring me my bow of burning gold! Bring me my arrows of desire! Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold! Bring me my chariot of fire! I will not cease from mental fight, Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand, Till we have built Jerusalem In England's green and pleasant land.'",10,4,8,7 October 2004
A Clockwork Orange," A film for half-baked sociologists.
","The tale of a violent man (a boy in the book) and societies attempt to reform him.Never before has so much junk been written about a low budget movie that fails on so many fronts. You can read quite a bit of this cheap sociologist gobbledegook  in the reviews that surround this one - in case you doubt my word!Let us start with a few facts for a change: The film was made on the ultra cheap. Look at the lack of extras or expensive sets (all filming took place in real locations). Look at the cheap TV lighting. Look at the amount of hand held camera work. Warner Brothers didn't really want to make this movie, but Kubrick told them it would make pots of money and that won them over - in this he was right!(To quote a Clash lyric: 'They wear smart suits. And think it's funny. Turning rebellion in to money...')Alex is living in a society we don't really see (in the movie at least). So how can we judge 'society values?' Is Alex a one-off or common?  This is a society that sells penis-shaped ice-lollies to children so it must be a bit sick in the head, but no attempt is made to give the movie on-the-ground context.Set in the future is it? Well it is a future that looks a lot like the year it was made right down to the trousers and haircuts. Maybe the future looks a lot like 1972!I look for films to do two main things: To educate or to entertain. Clockwork Orange does neither. Many scenes are quite revolting - and bizarrely they are even found revolting by some of the  people who rate the movie highly!I went to a rough house school that housed real football hooligans, rapists and sociopaths. Let me tell you now, they didn't like classical music or have the ability to explain their actions in clear language to anybody. Several were too stupid to even form sentences.Having experienced/suffered the real thing why would I prefer to listen to the version of a highly protected/highly privileged  middle class man (Kubrick) who - in success - chose to live his life behind barbed wire, protected by big dogs and shotguns?
I can stand rape and violence if it has a point to it, but here it doesn't. I am not surprised the original 'rape victim' quit the movie, who would want to be portrayed on screen like that? Being held down and stripped, while someone with a bad comb-across tries to worm a hand held camera between your legs? I don't attack Anthony Burgess's book (which I have read) because I think that is a valid exercise in literature. Not that it is that good or that original. Even AB admitted that the use of slang was borrowed from elsewhere.I hate this film and the reasons that it was made. I also hate the people that make excuses for them. They should all be ashamed of themselves. Avoid at all costs.",1,142,283,1 October 2002
Where Eagles Dare," Simple minded boys-own action adventure story - but still evergreen entertainment.
","A set of crack British troops - with a little American help - takes on a Austrian mountain stronghold during Word War II.While sounding a little clichÃ©d in the telling (The Guns of Navarone with new scenery?), this typical piece of Alistair MacLean nonsense (written especially for the screen and only later a novel) makes a very good movie, with spills, thrills and easy-for-the- village-idiot-to-follow action. The power casting of Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton is a little wasted in this sort of thing, but they look like they are having fun. Those looking for feminist brownie-points should note the blank-eyed Mary Ure who handles a machine gun like she is using a hairdryer!It is is said that this is Clint Eastwood's most murderous role, I would hate to think how many people he shoots here. Certainly their ammunition bag seems not have a bottom in it. This is not meant to be taken seriously and the use of helicopters does seem a bit out of time (indeed the model used is way out of time!), but we are only in a video game land so we can't dwell too much.Interestingly the Austrian castle in the film had never been stormed in real life and some of the extras employed in the film had been around at the time of the real Nazi uprising! Some of the locals found it all a bit much, even in jest.Dim the lights, get yourself in a comfy chair, turn off your IQ down 100 points and enjoy. Simple minded entertainment with the emphasis on the word simple.",8,2,3,9 March 2004
Reservoir Dogs," Crash-bang-whalop from a director with something spanking new to offer.
","A set of criminals gather in a garage to discuss a jewel heist that has gone tragically wrong.What a fantastic film to start a career with. Tarantino shows that while he has never been to film school he knows what he wants and he knows how to get it. This doesn't take cinema to a new level but shows how to make a simple story - that could have been a cheap TV movie in someone else's hands - in to something epic. Yes epic, not a word I use very often.If you want proof that stories are in the telling, the mood and the music just look here. The story is nothing, but the delivery and the acting make it what it is.There really is no substantial plot. It is just throw you off balance cinema. Roth plays a man bleeding to death on a floor through most of the movie: what a fantastic device and so original. Who would have thought of that? Who indeed would not only have thought of that, but used it so effectively?The criminals (known by colours - or is it colors?) are funny, dangerous and strangely real. Real people that squabble over names, food and even tips. People that go from killing to small talk to humour as if it as all the same thing, in the same way that Prince goes from talking about sex to god as if it is also part of the same thing. Is this real? Is this how real criminals talk and behave. Not in the main, no, but probably true of a minority. The only problem - beyond this movie - is whether he can capture other types of criminals. The question remains open.Criminals, cops and  bystanders are all out to earn a dollar and return home to watch TV. The criminal is caught by one policeman and takes it out on another, who knows nothing about the original crime. People are in the wrong place at the wrong time. We have outlaws, but they are 9-2-5 outlaws, they want to eat out and drive nice cars. They are career criminals for whom the real world is too much like hard work. They want to live off the fat of the land, like the idle rich. They may have had real jobs (indeed they say they have), but it is not for them. As I said earlier, the plot is nothing. It is a frame for mood and atmosphere (what Kubrick took twenty years to learn Tarantino knows day one) and how it all turns out doesn't really matter. It is a journey, not a destination.Is the film moral? Not really. It is a mixed bag, but he is more moral than some comedies where out-of-work middle aged couples ride of in to the sunset having robbed a bank. Movie morals are different, it is not that people are dead, but how they died that matters. If you believe that cinema should include all people from society then films such as this should exist.Sadly Tarantino loses control in the 'ear' scene. I have nothing against the haunted house experience, but you can only spend so much time in it before emerging in to light. Making the audience nauseous is no achievement. Nor is shocking it. We can all do it. In life or on film.All movies have to have drama and to create all drama we must have conflict. We haven't much to play with here. It is a minimalist playbox, although we have the robbery (used sparingly and not at the beginning as most fly-by-nights would use it) and some gun play, but these are sidelines. This is a relationship play. People (criminals) that want both anarchy and order. They come together for greed, but the pecking order has to be established. It is not easy being leader of the anarchist, they are, by nature free thinkers that play and work for themselves.It doesn't let anyone believe that being a criminal is easy or a good career options. After all, as I hinted above, who are you working with? Other criminals who only want to look after themselves and would happily steal for you as much as the original target. This doesn't make it as clear as say Goodfellers, but the message is there all the same. When this film came out it maybe it wasn't as big a deal as is made out to be now. However the industry stood up and took notice as did most film buffs. This is something new and - as has been shown with the better Pulp Fiction - the product of  someone that has the seeds of magic in his fingers. Sadly QT started to believe his own hype, and worse started thinking that he only had to please himself to please his audience.
The problem is that QT is like the sexy girl your old school class. The problem isn't that she is sexy, the problem is that she knows it.",8,2,4,8 February 2004
Inside Man," Quality pot-boiler with grade A stars -- but certainly not a keeper.
","A gang of thieves take over a New York bank - but maybe there is more to it than a simple robbery-turned-hostage situation? When you get to a certain age you think you have seen all the movies that have been made or ever will be made. All you have left to look forward to is massive surprises (and very welcome they are too!) and movies that are bits and pieces of other (good) movies glued together. This is a very slick product with modern cinematography - the type is part TV advert and part professional clever-dicking: Arty shots for no real reason other than to show-off.Not the kind of material that I normally associate with Spike Lee (there is a back story if you want to search it out) but he gets us through it without ever stopping or running out of ideas. Not that a hundred directors couldn't have done it just as well.Get this for a cast: Denzel Washington (call-the-shots big city cop), Clive Owen (too good looking for his own good as a young man - now getting more interesting with age. Here a pro thief), Jodie Foster (not playing a goody-two-shoes character for once - won't spoil it), Christopher Plummer (a standard Mr Big) and William Dafoe (wasted as a police coordinator). Thankfully they are rarely on screen at the same time - probably because they would be too many arguments about who is getting blocked correctly and who has the individual spot on them.I have a problem with Denzel W - he is a very good actor that doesn't take on enough challenging parts. He has fallen in to the Sidney Poitier trap of thinking that he should be representing his race in nearly every movie (yes -- irony that he won an Oscar for the time he didn't) or else doing those walk-through parts that keeps his bank manager happy. Here he is good, but nothing special. I want to give him special praise for his command of the English language though - even though he doesn't display it here. He should come to London and do Shakespeare.I counted myself entertained and satisfied at the end of the two hours. Too superficial to watch more than once though.",7,4,6,30 April 2007
Pulp Fiction," A classic of black and bloody humour
","In modern day LA a set of barely-connected gangsters, corrupt failures and their hangers-on go about their daily business.A film with a lot to answer for. Certainly it took director Quentin Tarantino from cult director to magazine cover star and created a raft of imitators. It put a few noughts on the pay cheque of Samuel L Jackson and brought John Travolta back from B movie hell.Like Star Wars it is difficult to know if you are reviewing the movie or the hype. This movie lived on word-of-mouth. They didn't need to hype it - it grew from a modest budget black comedy to being the movie that everyone was talking about.The title says it all 'Pulp Fiction.' That means those cheap novels that you read on airplanes or on the beach: full of characters that you know by heart, stories that you have heard before. This movie makes fun of a few of these characters.While this is a black comedy, the film world has been blacker, but it has never been funnier. I'd have never have thought that bringing a drug overdose back from the dead would make me laugh, but it does. A failed attempt at homicide make me laugh, but it does. I could on a while longer.And just when you are getting clever-clever and think you have it all figured out off the film shoots of in another direction. Amazing. This is a must see twice movie - there is so much little detail you miss first time around - things that make what happens later clearer.I am always worried about morals. Few movie viewers are. They are more worried about being entertained. Just look at bullying you see on the playground, not at the act, but the bystanders (male and female) laughing , joking and enjoying.Whether I like it or not Tarantino forces me to be one of these people - and there are times I don't like it. He is more restrained than in Reservoir Dogs (another great movie) but people are brought on to be carried out - if you see what I mean.There is only one scene that is totally without justification. The scene where Travolta drives while high on drugs - he should have been shown have at least had a near-accident. But he just cruises along without a problem.The thing I notice is that the film is slipping in the IMDb ratings. I know why. The film has become overblown and over discussed. This isn't To Kill A Mockingbird or Shindler's List with social history to support it past its initial afterglow.We have even seen a TV series - The Sopranos - that is just as good and which borrows a few of its tricks. I learned nothing new about my life (or how to live it) from watching Pulp - not even from repeat viewings - but it is a brilliant piece of cinema that cannot be ignored, just as long as you take it as simple entertainment and remember the title at all times.",9,1,2,11 October 2002
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Rocking and rolling little timewaster
","A young card sharp loses heavily in a crooked game and has to find a way of paying his debts or else....Forget the plot, this is just an excuse to bring together a lot of British character actors (no future stars - but all ok) and crib bits and pieces of other peoples movies. Quentin Tarantino's early efforts being the most prominent. However it is done with far too much pace, sharp/cruel humour and rock music bombast for the MTV bred audience not to lap it up.
This is, amazingly, Guy Richies first film and credit to him for trying something with ambition. Also great to see what you can get done on a small budget and a couple of cheap back street sets (colour filters help disguise what they are!) He couldn't even afford the video playback system that most film makers use nowadays.He later went on to write and direct Snatch, which is basically the same product,but in much improved and expanded form. Nevertheless a very entertaining time waster and a real solid start for a director whose talents and depths are, as yet, unknown.",7,0,1,9 May 2003
Three Colors: Blue," Quality art-house material where style overrides content.
","A French woman loses her famous conductor husband and young daughter to a car accident and has to build her life afresh.One of these films that has nothing really new or original to offer but gets high IMDB marks because it is an emotion wrangler and has the quiet (almost silent!) appeal of Juliet Binoche in the lead role.(In competitive diving they have a tariff system which takes away marks for easier dives. This is an easier dive, but that doesn't mean the dive isn't excellently performed. I would take a whole point of the IMDB score under any such system!)While I admire cinematography and symbolism in movies I believe these are the support structures to the story. Here they push the story to one side and take over - to the point where there is often nothing but mood, posture and music.A move dedicated to grief and re-building is hardly going to be a laugh a minute, but Binoche wants to be frosty and controlled through the vast majority of this short (for a main feature) movie. Sorry, people don't grieve like that in real life - it is more a rollercoaster of emotions.We know so little about this now-ended relationship. How was she before the accident? How did they really interact? Was it really a happy relationship? We know that her husband was no angel - but how do we know this wasn't known to JB? A checklist of questions is not what I want in a movie that exclusively takes on one woman's life experience in such close up.Thankfully the final message is positive - life can be rebuilt. Wounds do heal. You can move on from tragedy.Here is a movie that may leave you entertained and moved, but it is far from a voyage of factual discovery unless you are an expert on body language and mind reading. Maybe there should be subtitles for this too?",7,1,2,11 January 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Enter the Dragon rewritten by anally retentive computer nerds.
","*This is a follow up to the original Matrix and therefore anything to be said here could be seen a spoiler to the original.*I have learned so many things watching movie and then writing about them. Here is just a selection: That a bit of cheap music can instantly create a bit of tension or take me back in time. That big subjects don't necessarily make for big movies (nor the other way round). That I don't like people trying to disguise cliché (including that tried and trusted good-versus-bad theme) by trying to wrap it up in so much wordy and visual nonsense. (Guess which one of those faults the Matrix Reloaded falls in to?!)Entertaining or not, the film makes little to no overall sense. However there are bits of plot I think I understand: It is set in two versions of the world, one the world of dreams (or close variations) and another in the 'real world.' The 'real world' is just a mine shaft in the ground where a group of escaped prisoners play revolutionaries against the computer - The Matrix - that entraps them. In other words a lot of what we see is a video-game played out in a giant computer - but you can actually 'die' in this video game through the film's own convenient b/s logic.Yes the script is pure garbage, in that no can really understand what is going on and this - or so the authors hope and presume - will prevent anyone from questioning it. After all you can't question what you don't understand, right? This movie has a logic all of its own and often the reverse of any known human version. Why stand and fight when you can flee through flight? Trapping humans in order create electricity, huh? First Spielberg with his 'futuristic' three wheeler cars and now this!Is this not the central paradox of sci-fi: People that are smart beyond are wildest dreams judged by what they create and are also incredibly stupid judged by what they say and do?(The Wachowski Brothers don't do interviews so no one can question them about this b/s world of their own invention. I suppose the praise they receive is the praise that many people who build castles in the air receive: Stolen from people that do great work in the real world and who are far smarter. There is a million miles between thinking up 'a car that runs on tap water' and actually creating a real one!)The look is quite interesting and the fact that so many people were dark glasses gives us the feeling that no one is quite human. Even when they are. Or sort of. Black people seem to have a large role to play and that is indeed curious - but like a lot of what goes on here, I have no idea what it means. Maybe they are the 'blacks with no soul' that were mentioned in Kentucky Fried Movie. People that turn this handicap to their advantage by playing MOR at weddings!The worst bit is the computer operator (Link) who gives a running commentary on proceedings like he is on a speedway track. Having seen people being captured (Superman like) from certain death with my own eyes it is good that this is confirmed verbally. Second worst bit is the creator of the Matrix (well he claims he is - he is a white bearded theatrical lovey so he must have!) who spouts even more riddles than your old maths teacher.Bruce Lee (most famous for Enter the Dragon which this apes), with only his body and the occasional numchucka created tension, speed and excitement that they can only top by millions of dollars worth of computer special effects and fly-by-wire. No let me take that back: Bruce you were still better than all of them, even with their special effects and wire work.",7,0,1,26 December 2004
Mystic River," The ties that bind - for the good, the bad, and the in-between.
","Three young friends play in the Boston street. They start to misbehave and a car approaches and a man climbs out looking like a cop, acting like a cop and seeming to have police ID. He beckons one boy over. He says they are going to take the boy somewhere (home maybe?) - the others say nothing and look on, glad it isn't them.However the man is not a cop, he is a child molester/sadist and has taken him to rape and quite possibly later murder. However, several horrific days later, the boy escapes to freedom - nevertheless what happened to him and the two others will never leave them. It marks every day of the rest of their lives: and for Dave (the kidnapped boy) the wounds run very deep in to his flesh.I am frightened of saying it, but Clint Eastwood is now America's best director: and not only that, he is one of the bravest. This is not the most obvious film. Dark, mean and giving little security blanket to hang on to. Thankfully he has assembled the best cast anyone could ask for and all three co-leads (the three street boys that go on to be men - Sean Penn (Jimmy), Tim Robins (Dave) and Kevin Bacon (Sean)) are excellent. Also worth a mention is Laurence Fishburne as a laconic black cop with a firm but fair attitude.This film is not really much about women nor is it flattering to them. The later actions of Dave's wife (Marcia Gay Harden) make little sense on any level unless clues lie on unfilmed pages of the Dennis Lehane novel. Further discussion of it would be a spoiler.The plot could (falsely) read as a whodunit or thriller: Jimmy's (an ex-con who now runs an convenience store) daughter is murdered and two main suspects quickly emerge. A boyfriend who was about to elope with her and the former abused boy Dave who had seen the girl behaving slightly wildly in a bar on the night she was killed. To make things worse Dave had come home late with a stab wound from that very night - he was 'stabbed by a mugger,' so he says, but the cover story makes no sense.To complicate things further Sean (Bacon) is now a cop on this very case with female problems of his own. Thankfully they are mostly off screen because this film has enough problems for several movies. He is no longer open friends with Jimmy, but clearly he is viewed as more than just an ex-con trying to make good. People that have read the book say that it remains true to its pages and that maybe is the reason why things happen slowly and the end is not an absolute full stop. The thriller part of exercise creaks like an old door because we have to believe that the Dave incident was a giant coincidence or he was - somehow - involved. And if so, why?I was intrigued as to why the three central characters should stay loyal to the area. What keeps them? Especially Dave who everyone views as damaged goods and not a crime victim. Even his own wife. As I said before, Jimmy runs a store (where did he get the money - from crime?) but has a criminal past and maybe even a criminal future if some of the people he is around are anything to go by. This is not a film that believes in total revelation.I am also puzzled by when the 'present day' is meant to be. There is confusion about whose blood was found in a certain place which would have been solved easily by DNA examination. They talk only of blood groups.Hmmm...Despite its many faults this is serious and skillful film making and while I agree with another reviewer - that television does this kind of the thing better - that isn't to say that this isn't a welcome addition to the cannon of believable (in outline form) street drama involving imperfect people trying to make the best of things in very difficult circumstances.",8,65,111,6 October 2005
Crazy Heart," Only Jeff Bridges could shine with this basic and shop-worn material.
","'Bad' Blake (Jeff Bridges) was once a famous country singer-songwriter (although how big and how famous are never clearly spelt out), but he has now slid to the very bottom of the greasy music pole: now a reluctant opening act or playing small shows in bowling alleys or suchlike dingy places.Age, booze and multiple divorces have taken further toll on his mind and body. Today, he rarely thinks much beyond his next drink or resting his weary bones in the nearest - and preferably cheapest - motel.In to this paint-peeling world comes a hint of genuine love and affection, courtesy of a much younger single-mother (and professional music journalist) Jean Craddock played by Maggie Gyllenhaal.There is not a lot of originality about this production. Indeed it might be viewed as an attempt to re-film The Wrestler in Stetson hats, where it not for Bridges. Talk about carrying a show on your shoulders. Although it does beg the question of how simplistic/basic country music is when an actor (with only very occasional musical forays to his name) can be so convincing.(Clever pastiche songs being a great aid to the believability.) Despite the negative opening headlines, things are not totally hopeless. Musical friends and agent are loyal. Dues are owed and paid. Indeed there seems to be ladies (of a certain age, granted) who, still, want to entertain the former legend back in their rooms. Yes, even the bottom of the showbiz barrel seems to have its freebies and its perks. When sober enough to actually enjoy them, that is.In many ways the act or review - and therefore after-the-fact analysis - takes some shine off this drift-down-the-river production. Indeed only re-enforces how little there is to chew on.Craddock has to be either mad or desperate to to take an interest in this long broken down musical artist who is not only old enough to be her father, but only one false step away from being a vagrant. What does she see in him? Is she so seduced by the romance of low-rent showbiz to see he is totally selfish (he has, for example, long taken no interest in his own child) and lives in the past? Maybe Bridges should milk this a bit - go on stage as his alter-ego Bad Blake. I am sure people would be happy to see it. Clearly he is good enough and the professional and functional songs on display here would pass twenty minutes of general inspection.",7,5,5,29 August 2011
Ice Age," Well produced, but criminally short on content and originality.
","Computer animation is merely a tool. Like all tools the tool actually creates nothing without human intervention and while they may be key to getting something done (this sort of  3D technique is relatively new) they are not a force by themselves. Only a new genre. Here a (talking) comic sloth, a stern mammoth and a slick mountain tiger work together to return a lost baby to its tribe. Well sort-of, but don't let me spoil one of the few lines of plot development for you!Boy is this thin and well trodden stuff. When two people can't stand each other in films you can be sure that ten minutes down-the-line they will be the best of pals, ready to die for one another. Shame real life isn't like that! Cliches are not cliches for nothing and the script writers haven't left anything obvious out - bar maybe a musical number, which would have at least been some light relief.I am reminded of a well known gag that Woody Allen once quoted in a movie about two old women in a restaurant. One says 'isn't the food here terrible.' And the other says 'yes, and such small portions.' This is far from terrible - indeed it is not at all bad - but the portions are too small: Character introduction - journey - climax. There should have been far more, but in this type of animation every second counts and every extra second shaves a point off the box office income!Glad I didn't pay for it though and anyone seeing it at a cinema better get a small popcorn or they will be still  eating it on the way home.",6,1,4,29 February 2004
A Hard Day's Night," Solid gold record of the Liverpool miracles at the point of making pop history.
","The Beatles travel down from Liverpool to record a TV show.If I was to meet Richard Lester I would shake his hand and thank him for recording the Beatles during the middle part of their career when they could entertain but hadn't yet shot off in to outer space. Without this we would have a piece missing from their history - and lets be frank - our history. They changed the world and all they had to change it with were electric guitars and their personalities!The script is clever in that it showcases the personalities of the group without asking them to do much acting. Wilfred Brambell tags along to give comedy relief and the whole thing fits in plenty of songs that are good - but not as good as what soon followed. They are still tied to the Northern dance halls.I have always thought that if they had a died in a car crash at this point they would be a mystery to the modern audience - hugely popular at the time - but not particularly stand-out from the other bands around. Like the way we regard Charlie Chaplin or Mary Pickford - both incredibly famous in their prime - but little regarded today. Whether you like to admit it or not there are three geniuses at work and Ringo Starr. So I guess that it is fitting that Ringo comes across the best of the group: Down-to-earth, chatty, witty and willing to talk to anyone. Even the kids down by the river. John Lennon had a comic wit that could have given him another career had his music not been up to scratch. Talk about being master of the witty comeback. Anyone watching this film will see London as it really was at the time. Not the swinging sixties that everyone pretends it was. Grubby shops, unpainted windows that look about to fall out of their frames, empty streets bar a few beat up cars. I guess you could say this is the perfect record of Beatlemania: The driving beat songs (cranked out even quicker on stage), the backstage sieges, the ping-pong put downs that is the hallmark of English humour, the screaming that overpowered the performance. Enjoyable at the time (as light entertainment) it becomes an important historical document now and every generation should see it. Your pop culture education depends on it.",8,74,92,8 April 2004
The Wolf of Wall Street," Entertaining comic celebration of the worst of human behaviour rather than any form of condemnation.
","A former Wall Street broker realises that pumping junk (penny) stock is very lucrative and turns a small cottage industry into something a lot bigger. Soon crossing white lines even he can see.I am generally a fan of Martin Scorsese to the point of often wanting to watch his movies more than once. Sometimes even owning. He has made some fantastic films giving some real depth and insight into off-beats, street people and criminals. There isn't a director working today who he hasn't educated. Indeed quality hard-edged TV shows like The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire are almost based on his templates, look and ideas.(Can you imagine these shows even being made if he had died at birth?)And yet, and yet, the man has a serious flaw: he struggles to be moral. On film at least. He seems on the side of the conman, the crook and the mafioso. The Joe Public who get crushed under their mighty wheels are of little interest to him. Comedy fodder. Police/law enforcement who stop them (or at least try) dull and low paid. Sometimes corrupt, inefficient and devious. At other times ignored completely or treated as last-reel extras.Here he brings all his faults to the table and then some. Indeed almost seems to be underlining them. The FBI are full of subway riding drones in cheap brown suits and non matching ties.. Dry humoured nasty people who want to end the party (all bought with stolen money) early. There only advantage - over their quarry - being not risking sleeping six inches from a toilet seat.Although few have noticed, this film has been shot before as 'Boiler Room.' A passable Vin Diesel number. So little has this film being seen that some scenes are almost copies of it! Indeed copies with a bit bigger budget. When you have the budget the camera can swoop and roll through a million extras - all acting their little socks off. Here everyone acts like they are on The Price is Right, even when they are work!(Do the tits-out extras get extra pay? Hope so. Humiliation should come with compensation.) Excess? I can spot it in small doses. It doesn't need to be repeated over and over again until I wonder if I have sat on the remote control and jumped back two chapters. Voice-over too. In case you have gone blind during the movie. It stops just short of flashing subtitles pointing out that what we are watching is immoral or illegal.But wait and hold on, it does entertain and does make you laugh. Guilty laughs, but laughs (of the out-loud variety) are not common with me. A lot of it is probably true as well. Or true-ish. Clearly MS doesn't know how a helicopter is actually flown, so why not employ somebody who does? DiCaprio is very good in the central role of Jordan Belfort. Best acting yet and let's be frank his face has been his fortune so far. Clearly over-the-top and silly at times, but some real acting wrinkles. It is not him on the stunts though, the double is too tall to be him and even in the 'daring' sex scenes we never see candle wax on his back. Only that of the double.I love Jonah Hill (Donnie in the the film). He is a brilliant comic actor. He just has it. Never afraid to make a fool of himself, he does a wonderful performance as best friend and co-conspirator. Not consistent though, stupid one minute smart the next. I wonder if he is going to go down the Jack Black route and get his own vehicles? Second wife Naomi (played by Aussie Margot Robbie) is hot in a Playboy way and seems appropriate for the role, but you don't like her character much. Just another spoilt mercenary happy to join the bandwagon without asking too many questions. Unlike his first (screen) wife. Whether Robbie is going on to anything else is open to question. Probably turn up in costume in one of those superhero movies they are always making. Has the build for it.In the old 40's Warner Brothers days the film ended with the crook dead or in jail. Here there is another scene to underline the bit about Scorsese being basically immoral. And maybe so if the audience if the IMDb rating is correct. Maybe we are all going to hell laughing.",7,1,2,22 October 2014
American Gangster," Moral, fair, educating, intelligent and entertaining - all at the same time!
","An enterprising black drug criminal and a whiter-than-white cop go head-to-head from the late 60's onwards.Life writes the best jokes and the best drama, so the lucky authors are simply those that write them down on paper first. If WE are lucky they are the great writers themselves and can frame the story in the best possible way. American Gangster falls short of being an all-time classic, but is clever enough to have studied (and learnt) from a wide range of movies from The French Connection through Serpico through to the quality TV of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. It also borrows from a few failed movies like New Jack City.It says in the bible that in the world of the blind the one-eyed man is king. Frank Lucas (Densil Washington) wasn't that smart, but he was smarter than those around him. Rather like Al Capone. If you listen hard enough to this production you can see he doesn't even follow his own limited advice! (I always judge criminals by their skill at staying out of prison - so Lucas can't really score very highly on my own Richter Scale.) Richie Robers (Russell Crowe, who you may be interested to know has a mother-in-law local to me and sometimes visits) is not a great all-round actor because he isn't that smart as a person (you can't play smart unless you really are smart - Brando's problem). He is best playing pig-head and obstinate working class types with a sense of fair play. So well done the casting department. Washington is the kind of actor that probably can't walk past a mirror and not look at himself. He refuses to wear the afro of that the real Frank Lucas sported and wants to be Joe Cool at any point when his life isn't endangered. Densil doesn't do sweaty or jerky anyway. In truth, he is getting a bit samey.The problem with movies is momentum and falling in to the trap of simply repeating yourself. Easy traps to fall in to when real life (which this is - in outline form) does the same. When this is good it is top class - when it sags (which it does at various points) it comes across like above average TV drama. Equally it can't walk away from cheap thrills and the blindingly obvious. I don't like being in the company of professional lookers of the other way. However saintly they are framed - they are freeloaders of the first order. Pimps of scum rather than plain scum.Moral issues are dealt with fairly and - to be frank - in an arbitrary manner. Thrown in from nowhere and going nowhere. Long shot of dead junkie and crying child from the book of movie cliché. Praise director Ridley Scott for including them (didn't have to), but about ten seconds thought has gone in to it.If I'd have written the piece I would have gone more for the early years - learning the biz on the knee of the famous (original black gangster) Bumpy Johnson. Indeed this point (suggested as fact in this movie) may not have been the whole truth and nothing but the truth. At the end I counted myself as very well entertained and curious enough to read more about the real people on the screen. The only downside is that Cuba Gooding Junior proves that unless he has a good script he just fades in to the wallpaper like an extra. No star charisma at all.",8,0,4,7 October 2008
Jaws," Roll Up - Roll Up - Meet the guy who didn't like it much!
","A killer shark throws a seaside town in to chaos.In my movie writing I tend to be benign about movie that seek only to entertain the popcorn munchers, because they keep the industry going. However there are good popcorn movies and bad popcorn movies.(Indeed there are popcorn movies that fall in to the middle.)I was in the playground when this movie came out and the school morons thought this was fantastic - 'did you see that naked woman being bitten in half - wasn't that great. All that blood in the water - fantastic!' They said, wide-eyed with wonder. (In most movies rated PG women are not bitten in half, so congratulations to Steven S for getting a horror movie stunt shown to kids. And he repeated the trick in Jurassic Park!)I am sorry that special effects were anything other than special in the 1970's. Yes the shark looks as dead as a dodo, but sharks do look a bit like that anyway. I have been to one of the few places where you can view sharks close to in safety and they do look a bit dead-in-the-eye. They like to come very close just to see you!At the risk of starting a 'I'm right - you're wrong' debate, let us look at what this is: A cheap thrill ride. Psycho and The Shinning were also cheap thrill rides, so let us not knock it for that, but it is worthless as any kind of document about sharks. A few rouge and hungry sharks kill humans, but they really don't like us much. Of all the food in the sea we are among their least favourite!(Does Steven S ever think how much misinformation he has given the world with this film?)The opening shots are, as our school moron said before, skillful and shocking. John Williams is a genius and produces more fright with a chamber orchestra than Spielberg does with a film camera! A master craftsman at work. Sadly the script is flabby and indeed it is just an exercise in filling time before the next cheap thrill or even cheap thrill that never happens. When this film moves it moves well - but Schneider's paranoia is one note and pointless. We know he is right and the town-folk masses are wrong. A better script would have made him doubt himself.We have read about how difficult life filming 'on the boat' was. The steady cam - not available at the time - was designed to overcome these problems. It looks like they quit early, they could (and should) have extended the climax having kept us waiting for it for so long. Films like The Perfect Storm show that you can keep a scene going longer than they realized in the 1970's.What I learned from Jaws is that films can get away with the murder if they open and finish well. What people who own the video or DVD do in the scenes that involve Schneider's troubled domestic life I don't know - probably hit fast forward I guess.Most blockbusters are actually poor movies: Spiderman, Superman and Batman got a lot of hype and word-of-mouth - but future generations will see them as the flimsy flashy trash that they really are. What is the legacy of Jaws - spreading a load of c**p about the nature of sharks and making teenyboppers - who have even seen a real horror movie - scream?Yes - there are plus points. Lots of pros at work both behind and in front of the camera and a great score - but all these people working their hardest cannot disguise that all they are working with a third rate pulp novel from a third rate novelist.",6,6,15,11 October 2004
Ray," Entertaining exploration of the life of a musical legend with a perfect lead.
","The life and times of Ray Charles (Robinson) blind musical genius as well as a long time drug addict and womaniser.I don't know how many music biographies I have seen, but I always think that they come with a certain amount of plus points and a certain amount of the reverse. However God knows how they could have made this if the central plank had been clean, sober and faithful. These are the only things that writer/director can get any mileage out of as he portrays RC as being beyond the pale musically and never wanted for a thing from his first hit onwards.Musicians are sexy. Even blind ones. If you have a musical instrument in your hands the interest of women always increases. If you can play it and don't look like the Elephant Man then you are half way up to the bedroom already. If you a genius at it many women want to do you there and then! Charles fell in to the latter category and didn't say 'no' all that often. Indeed he should have yearned to say 'no' a few more times in his life generally, even though it would have prevent this film from being made. While exploration in life is fine some of us know that fire burns without putting our fingers in to the flames! Drugs may have helped in the early days (all those endless bus rides) -- but they soon started to pull him apart. The big band was partly a way of coasting through performances when he wasn't in much of a state to play. Not that is film wants to know about anything about that!While not a RC record buyer he had a certain amount of entertainment value.You'd listen to him on the radio and not want to turn him off. On stage and in shape he was better. Not only a great piano player but a great voice (once he had found his own) and great soul. Like many great black men -- he had natural soul and all he had to do was let it out. A poor farming background rounding every lick and vocal in a way that the middle class white guy (like me) can't get close to.Taylor Hackford has probably seen as many musical bios as I have and knows that if he falls asleep at the wheel he'll turn this in to movie of the week. Indeed there are times when it looks a bit like an expensive movie of the week as the obvious links (stock footage of cities as they were back then) and the rolling headlines flip across the screen. The fact that the film grain doesn't fit and the picture resolution is too good for newspapers shouldn't worry us to much. Nor should the perfectly tuned pianos that RC plays even in the early day dives! This is -- after all -- a movie.Jamie Foxx is a sensation as Charles. You believe him for every frame. The shelf full of awards are a fair reward for his work, but he needs to remember that he'll never get a part like that again and that it is downhill all the way now! The support roles were also well played, but I didn't see anything as stand-out -- mostly because of the vested-interest thing. Good to see meaty parts for black women though.(Your husband might be cheating on you -- but that is easier to bare when you are living in a fully paid for house in a nice neighbourhood. Although divorce came later -- skimmed over/misrepresented here -- the real divorce came early. She saw him as a beneficiary figure and formed her own life with their joint child.) Was Charles cheated in his early years? -- did money go places it shouldn't? Yes, but that was normal. Just ask Chuck Berry. Being off-your-head on smack probably doesn't help with your bookkeeping either.In most bio's there is a dip or a setback and then a period of comeback and then public recognition of what only a few knew all along. Not here. The career is plain sailing and the Georgia 'ban' is fiction. (Why drop in a big lie in like that?) His change to country music (the biggest U-turn in music history?) does really matter because whatever he played he made his own. Like all the greats.He lived a long life for someone who didn't look after himself (he always paid to have the best dope and the best dope dealers around -- it is the junk that they cut it with that normally kills you) and found applause from both white, black and everything that goes between. He deserved to be forgiven when one great gift (sight) was taken from him early. And if it is worth anything to you -- I forgive him myself.A nice memory of a one-of-a-kind musician and a nice safeguard to his everlasting legacy. I now wonder whether they can make anything of the life of Stevie Wonder? A better artist -- but for film purposes didn't make as many of dramatic mistakes as Raymond.",8,1,2,21 April 2006
Blow," Morality tale set in the drug world
","Life story of George Jung who went from street corner dope peddler to one of the biggest distributor of cocaine in America.Easy to see why cinema is interested in characters like this: Here you have everything: Rag to riches, greed, sex, power, betrayal, loyalty, social history and morality play. Taking on subjects like this is like shooting fish in a barrel - if you can't make two hours of interesting cinema about this (with a Hollywood budget) you better get another job.Strangely Depp doesn't really know what to do with the lead character. He plays it poker faced and we learn far more from the voice-over than we do from his actions or expressions. Hard drugs leave victims and given that Depp talks mainly about himself and his problems it is hard to feel anything for him. No real attempt is made at explaining why America is so drug ridden and dependent. Certainly countries that provide cocaine - where it is cheaper than talcum powder -don't seem to have the same problems with it. Maybe America is a country where not feeling great all the time is a form of illness? In voiceover Depp suggests that artists are the leaders in America as regards taste and consumption. Maybe this is my clue?So what have we got: A man that won and then lost. Is this better than never having tried? Or working in a factory and struggling with the bills? Even in success our protagonist never seems to get beyond having brief moments of triumph. Was this really true, was counting money just as tedious as being broke or is this just an interpretation?As a film Blow moves along well enough to keep you watching. Penelope Cruz makes a good impression as the selfish, but basically honourable, wife. And Paul Reubens (in a bad wig) makes an impression as the hairdresser/dope dealer that speeds our anti-hero on his way, but a lot of  the parts are throwaway. There is no honour among thieves? Well there never has been - apart from in the movies.Blow is little more than an inflated TV bio-pic. Every step along the road is predictable and signalled in advance. We know that the end of this road will be premature death or a prison cell. It is just a matter of which.",7,1,2,17 April 2003
Raging Bull," Boxing B picture gets a big budget makeover.
","Bio pic of controversial and troubled boxer Jake La Motta.Hard to say quite why a La Motta bio-pic should be the 'pet' project of Martin Scorsese (director) and Robert De Niro (lead), but clearly it was, so a great deal of time and effort was spent over a character the world had not only forgotten about, but only the most ardent sports fans knew about in the first place!While La Motta was clearly a world class boxer (even middleweight World Champion for a short while), he was hardly one of the all-time greats and had a fighting style that involved more bravery than skill. His habit of walking through a jab was almost a lesson in how 'not' to box!Out of the ring his habit of articulating emotion with his fists, rather than his mouth, was well known, but here he is turned in to a fully formed psychopath to accommodate De Niro's acting abilities. Certainly the young La Motta was a wild criminal and occasional mugger (something that the film makes no reference to - despite being mentioned in his autobiography, the inspiration for this film), but it is hard to believe what we see on film.The film was conceived and written for De Niro to go clean over-the-top and for people that don't know any better to mistake it for great acting.(In this he was successful - as he won the Best Actor Oscar.)De Niro got himself fit and then got himself fat for this film, but so what? Anyone can box for short takes on film, it is boxing for 15 rounds with only 30 second breaks that the public can't do. As regards getting fat for the later scenes - so what again? Has anyone else ever got praise for eating two dinners a day in France?The strange thing about this picture is how much it is like those old B pictures. Not only are we mostly in B&W (colour for a single home movie), but also spend extended periods in medium shot. The fights are announced in subtitles, and then we are in to the boxing clichés that involve point-of-view, the blood, the slow-motion, the ringside cigars, the flashbulbs. Scorsese seems to think that we don't know that boxing is legalised violence and need it pointing out to us then underlined for good measure. The strange thing is that La Motta wasn't (and isn't) a dullard or a patsie, but quite a canny guy who later worked as a second rate comedian (shown in the film) and even after dinner speaker, but here he appears a bit slow, tongue tied and withdrawn. To this day (at 80 plus) he is a machine gun of wisecracks and mini-jokes, yet is portrayed here as a sullen introvert. I can't marry the two images.(Given his involvement in the film and having read the script I cannot see why he would sanction this. Maybe he thought the film was just a piece of passing nonsense and objected - even to the point of talking about legal action - when he realised that this gave him a false image?)It is interesting to note that the scene where De Niro attacks his brother-in-law (in a fit of paranoia) was not rehearsed. Pesci was not told what was going to happen and the surprise on his face is real, not acting!The film effects people because violence is very cinematic and despite all the disclaimers most of us enjoy short bursts of it. The dialogue (by Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin) is good and truthful, but drags after a while. The characters expose their limits early and have only to play them out for the rest of the time.Having seemed doubting and questioning it may surprise you that I like the picture and recommend it. It is very compulsive and has something that you can't put your finger on. Despite being violent and sometimes unpleasant you can't help routing for the guy and hope he can find happiness somehow.Maybe this is because I take my hat of to all boxers, they have bravery, dedication and courage that even twenty million dollar a picture actors envy and want to wear the clothes of.",8,6,11,18 April 2003
Shrek," State-of-the-art computer animation used to tell a cracking little story
","Shrek is a green ogre who lives in a swamp, but his king sends him on a mission which he must complete to get his own land back.You only have to watch ten minutes of this film to realise that this is going to be a classic. Eddie Murphy being employed as a wisecracking donkey was a casting dream and plays well against the more plain Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers. Ok the plot is old, new, borrowed and blue (all recaps and references to fairy tales), but I don't care. It is all so much good fun and better than that, the kind of thing that can be enjoyed by young and old, male or female. It is really a dream of movie and some brilliant pop tunes are employed that really work fantastically against the images. Real tear-to-the-eye stuff.A real bliss-out of a movie and all parties should be congratulated for making it so great. A real DVD buyer, because it can be enjoyed over and over again. Bring on the follow up, I can't wait.",8,50,58,4 September 2003
The Silence of the Lambs," A thinking person's horror movie!
","An FBI operative seeks the help of a convicted serial killer in the search for one still active.This film features some very good acting. Not great acting, mind you, because the roles don't involve evolving before our eyes. The characters have evolved before they hit the screen.Thomas Harris is one of the cleverest novelists around. He is both a good writer and a clever writer: Plenty of good writers write novels about subjects that don't engage the general public, but are well written and deserve to be read. They write for a small audience and, if they are lucky, sales keep the author fed, sheltered and clothed until the next one comes out.However Harris is also a clever writer in that he chooses the material of cheap thrillers (serial killers - zero points for originality!) and writes about them with the care and attention that is normally reserved for our friends in the former paragraph. The subject is taking him to the top of the ladder - not his care with words.There is something slightly bizarre a-foot here. This is a film based on cheap thrills and tension, which I could live with if the reviewers (of all colours) weren't so precious about it all.This film takes a lot of time and trouble over minor details and yet major plot lines are clearly S-T-U-P-I-D. Actors sit in on FBI lessons to learn technique and procedure then Agent Starling goes and visits Lector ON HER OWN!(Yes isn't it amazing how quickly common-sense - no matter the FBI rule book - is thrown away when it gets in the way of an easy tension device!)There is a lot right with this film and a lot wrong with it too. Thrillers have no other role other than thrill and thrill it does, but I hate the authors coded references that only he and a few PhDs/crime authors can understand. Private jokes are snobbery.(I am glad that IMDb have a trivia section for this movie it answered a lot of my questions. With Harris every 'stray' phrase has a story behind it.)Killer Lector is a bit like Huggy Bear in Starsky and Hutch. He knows everything about everything and it is a shame he is not the policeman because all serious crime would be solved in five minutes! Yes we have to have some device for throwing these people together (however silly), but how does he know all this info from his well guarded cell. Is he on some private 'serial killer' bulletin board?('Hey guys - that woman that was sliced up in to six pieces in Houston -- that was me....')A lot of people got a lot of enjoyment from this film and I thought it was quite good too, but it is also slightly sick. The subject matter is worthy of our attention, but I am uneasy about it being served up as 'great art' and given Oscars.This about as much 'great art' as the musical Grease. Take away the horror movie stunts (or film them in a more benign way) and it would have flopped at the box office.Also to be noted is that this is a 'strong woman' picture - if Agent Starling was a man most women would have marked it a point or two lower than they have. I hope that isn't read as a sexist observation.",7,1,3,10 October 2004
Signs," Good production values but no originality and little vitality.
","Crop circles appear in a farmers field, but are they the work of aliens or practical jokers?The very mention of crop circles as a plot device sends shivers down my spine. Everyone knows they are made by sad people with planks of wood working in the middle of the night. That is apart from the simple circles that are caused by freak mini whirlwinds. Here we are expected to throw away such knowledge and start down the route of 'maybe, just maybe.'Mel Gibson plays an ex-priest turned farmer who has lost his faith after the tragic death of his wife (oh flashing lights and heavenly choruses - will this come in to play later in the film!?). He lives on his semi-isolated farm with his two children and his brother and seems to have an ideal rural life before he becomes bothered by night time invaders who don't seem to be able to be caught.At several points this film fails to make any sense. This is America and better still an American farm and yet no guns are available. Equally this is a story where the real story is elsewhere, broadcast on TV and only partly explained. While not wanting to take on any film that goes down any route in telling a story - if you want to tell a story about 'overcoming' then there are many routes. Why this one?What can you say without being a spoiler? Very little. If you have seen Close Encounters, War of the Worlds and The Birds then you will get the general idea of what the film is about. Although all the above films are good, I don't rate any of them as being classic because they are such simple plot devices that only work by expensive special effects.Here we have cheap special effects of the 'rattling doorknob' variety that almost bring to mind a cheap Hammer horror film. There is, sadly, nothing new to offer just a lot of something-is-about-to-happen that, bizarrely, even the actors don't seem to be taking seriously!(Although how people act under real stress might well seem silly - so maybe I have to qualify that.)There is nothing really wrong with the film in terms of acting or production, but we have been here before. The director (Shyamalan) needs a bit of help - he is taking on too much himself. Taking an acting role in this film is by far the biggest mistake. He created a modern classic in the Sixth Sense, but - on the evidence here - he is running out of ideas fast and merely forming greatest hits tapes from other people's movies.",6,3,7,8 February 2004
The Sixth Sense," A mini-masterpiece that delivers shocks, surprises and thrills.
","A child physiologist (Bruce Willis) with a rocky marriage comes to visit a troubled boy (Haley Joel Osment) who claims to be seeing the dead.The problem with movies is that someone has always been there first. I was lucky with Psycho in that I didn't know anything about the film before I saw it - although I would have dearly loved to see it on a cinema screen. Here I was told there was a 'twist' and having been warned I looked out for the clues and got them.(Not so sure I would have done if I had come in stone cold and just let it wash over me, though!) Osment - as the little eight year old boy - is a revelation. He acts like he is thirty year old dwarf rather than a child. How does he do it? When I was that age I could barely prepare a piece of toast, Osment has to carry a major motion picture by his emotions alone. Truly as good a piece of acting as I have ever seen from a pre-teen. Willis lowers his voice and tries to compete - but he is being outclassed and he knows it too!This is a throwback picture in that the threat is outside and little glimpsed. It has the best of Hitchcock and a million B's to steal from; and this includes the reverse-of-norm wide shot - rather than close in on tragedy the camera pulls back as if not to intrude. There is a car accident scene where a medium-expanding-to-long shot is used in a masterful way.There isn't a lot to write about this film beyond general platitudes about performance and moody setting. This is clever in that it never gives you too much to hang on to - no barrel chested hero about to come charging to the rescue. It wants to throw you off balance, keep you off balance, lead you to believe that it is going one way and then shots off in another.True, there is nothing really essential about this film. Nothing that is going to change your opinion on anything - not even whether there really are ghosts and people that can communicate with them.Manoj Night Shyamalam might not be Hitchcock quite yet, but at least he has learnt a few of his better tricks and has even added a few of his own.Just because it is only escapist entertainment doesn't mean that it isn't also very good. It is actually very, very good.",8,0,2,12 October 2004
Casino," Rise and fall of Las Vegas gambling - Scorsesse style
","The real life story of how the Mafia - through dubious front men - won and lost casino gambling in Las Vegas.Hard to see how director Martin Scorsesse could really go wrong with a script and subject like this. Totally down his street. This is almost Goodfellers Part II and to make this more obvious they even have some of the same cast - including Robert De Niro as Sam Rothstien the mob front man taking heat from the overworld AND the underworld.If this film had have been made before Goodfellers (probably the best organised crime picture ever made) then it would have been better received. This is not as good and requires too much setting up (almost documentary style) and we don't really care quite as much. It also has a nasty underbelly.The message is that gambling is for idiots and in this world nobody trusts anybody else. This is not a point that you have to go searching for, because it is pushed down your throat through voice-over and then underlined through action. People here are cold and in it for themselves; although this may be true-to-life.I love the little scenes that are truthful. The smiling receptionist setting up the robbery of the guest. People being lured in to debt for the fun of handing out punishment. Casino cheats being dealt with on the spot. It presents a view of 1970's Las Vegas almost as if it were a middle eastern country where thieves have their hands removed. The real thrust of this film is the feeling of being at the cross-roads. Where legitimate business and organised crime meet. De Niro has to play both sides and this is not without danger; as the opening and closing scenes demonstrate. Joe Pesci represents the old school rob 'em/shoot 'em world of the mob. A thuggish money earner while de Niro is a rob'em through a fountain pen type. Uniquely, in my own viewing experience, they share voice-overs giving different spins on the same events.Despite being a thug I prefer Pesci because he is walking the only path that he knows. He is a good thief because he is brave and immoral. 'It is all about the dollars.' He says. De Niro (Rothstien) had choices and made bad ones.Despite being garlanded Sharon Stone does nothing with her 'love interest' role apart from looking good and doing some shrieking. Like everyone else she is selfish and me-first, a Las Vegas hustler who lives as a parasite. While interesting, in that it gives the story some variety, the fact that she hooks up with the De Niro (who has his doubts - even in voice over) shows that no one is quite as smart as they like to think.Scorsesse is good at the making people human with little subplots or humour, but he loses the film in some of the violence. It goes on too long and merely drags us through the gutter with the characters. It also cuts against the grain and timing of what goes before. Casino isn't a great film because it doesn't hang together well and we don't care about the main three characters. They made a pact with the devil and they have to abide by the consequences.What remains utterly baffling is the final reel in which the old Las Vegas is blown up to be replaced by the corporation, family safe, version which is sneered at in final commentary: Almost tearful about the dying of America's last wild frontier. In Scorrese's world nothing is worse than being boring, safe and Mafia free...",8,1,2,15 April 2003
Thirteen Days," Cosner gets up close and personal with the Kennedy's
","*Spoiler Alert for those that slept during history lessons*A recreation of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis told from inside the White House. History on film. Deep breath. Pause. First they want to you to write essays about it  at school, now they expect you to pay for it at the box office!
I am Mr Average. I know as much about the Cuban Missile Crisis as the next Mr Average. Maybe slightly more due to my Longman Chronicle of the 20th Century - a great book, not only allows you to learn about history it also doubles as an exercise weight.Given that we ALL know that the world didn't have World War III we are left with the 'how close did we come?' as the central question.
Kevin Cosner is the star of this show as the (special) Kennedy presidential advisor and Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp star as John F Kennedy and Bobby F Kennedy respectively. I don't understand American accents, so I am not (unlike other reviewers) able to say whether they are authentic vocal performances.We don't see the Soviet authority - merely the top spy (worked out by Cosner in a spare moment!) and ambassador. How serious were the Soviets? Were they playing games? Were they trying out a new and ridiculously young President to see how far he would go? Don't look for answers here.
Did Kennedy struggle to keep control of the military? The film says yes - but I'm not sure about this either. Without this another plank of the drama is removed, leaving us even more dramatically threadbare. Certainly the CIA didn't trust Kennedy and his habit of disappearing with women (putting him out of contact with them) left the US exposed for short periods.Missiles in Turkey were removed, as part of the final deal, only the American public was not told about it for quite some time. Some argue that America was going to remove them - as they became obsolete - on cost grounds, so little was given away in the long run. Here the film fudges and seems to give the impression that this may have been the intention - but a final decision had not been taken. Great history doesn't always make great drama and I'm sorry to say this came across as a bit sterile. Good effort though. Maybe we would have been better off with a documentary - especially if we had the Soviet side of things.",7,0,1,6 October 2002
Jackie Brown," Trashy caper nonsense - but saved by grade A acting performances.
","A stewardess (Jackie Brown played by Pam Greer) gets in to legal trouble when bringing contraband back to the US and has to tread a difficult path between the police and the dangerous criminal that is using her.Certainly easy to see why Tarantino would be interested in this piece of airport trash (lots of mini-characters, cross agendas and ping-pong dialogue), but harder to see why he should chose to make the thing so long and laborious.(Maybe it is a case of 'never mind the quality, feel the width?')Fancy having Robert 'I've never paid for it' De Niro (maybe working at his 'fashion director' discount price?) and give him a throw away role - as a slow speaking criminal moron that anyone in the Actors A-Z could play! He is not even funny-stupid, just stupid-stupid!Greer is not stretched here anymore than she was in her Blacksploitation heyday. She is in a hole and has to think her way out. There is no one else in her life, she is not totally honest (ambiguity should never be knocked in movies!) and anything she does is only really about serving herself. Good performance - but there is nothing to really go wrong.Tarantino is actually quite a green film maker (he prefers giving 'my life as a hot new director' interviews and watching B movie junk to learning his trade on a set). Maybe he knows the limits of his own talents - only time will tell. Certainly his criminals are remarkably samey - idiots, thugs and street comedians with guns.If you want to portray a caper in great detail (and cover the same ground more than once ala Kubricks early work) then you have to make sure that every little thing works and is correct. As the goofs index shows, there are clear errors that you can spot in one sitting and that doesn't even include things that make no sense at all.Here we have a rehearsal of a criminal act that the police are privy too. Why a rehearsal? It is a trap, the criminal has fallen in to it, arrest him. Why ask him to go again? What are they learning from the first time, he can't lead them anywhere? He might change his plans and bring his money in some other way next time!Equally a child could come up with a way of transferring money easier than here - why the elaborate pantomime, what about simply going to the ladies toilet and passing bags under the door?Without getting involved in spoilers - the way the thing is resolved is barely TV movie standard. After a sloth like crawl through the rest of the film - the thing wraps at double speed, with a stock device out of TV drama writers' handbook. I doubt any movie of the last ten years has had so much acting talent, budget and attention and yet come up with such an average product.",7,1,3,13 May 2003
Gangs of New York," Violent and pointless trawl through the gaslight NY gutter of yesteryear.
","In 1846 a boy sees his father killed in a gang battle on the Five Point slums of New York and grows up intent on patient and cold blooded revenge.Only Martin Scorsese could get this pointless and expensive pot-boiler made and only the presence of a top class actor like Daniel Day-Lewis stops it from falling apart at the seams. God bless him for taking the role, he couldn't be bad in anything even if he tried. While fortunes have been spent on the setting (very convincing too) what goes on in the foreground is backside achingly dull. MS seems to know it too and the only thing he can think of is to throw in lots of violence, sex and pop music (yes you read me right!) hoping to spice up the tasteless and banal life-on-the-street soup. This is a Dickensian world of thieves, gangs, corruption and intrigue, but despite having three writers it has no soul and no depth. Charles Dickens took us to the underworld but we got a sense of time, place and purpose among the downbeats and the downtrodden. Here we have only cartoons (corrupt cop, corrupt politician, big bad boss, etc.). We are stuck on no-hope street - you are born stupid, live stupid and die stupid. Usually in some violent and over-the-top way.Leonardo DiCaprio is a problem because he is not much of an actor. Good looking and high cheek-boned he has not had his 'Born of the Fourth of July' - where Tom Cruise won an Oscar nomination and proved he could, if pushed, act a bit. His character is stupid and uneducated, but smearing dirt on your face and voicing words in cod Irish (that is what it sounds like anyway) is not really acting and doesn't carry the weight of the picture at all.Daniel Day-Lewis is supposed to be the arch villain but we are with him all the way because he is the only one doing anyway remotely interesting or having anything remotely interesting to say! Cameron Diaz dyes her hair red and plays an Irish pickpocket, but seems a bolt-on to establish the leads heterosexuality. The film had production difficulties and you can see why. You can almost hear them in the screening room whispering 'this isn't working - this isn't working' as you watch the film. The book may have have seemed fascinating and historical in print (to Martie anyway), but has little impact on the screen. Losers, lose - but before they lose they fight, screw and shout at each other a lot. I was glad when the last throat had been slashed and the last drop of blood had run down the snowy NY gutter, because it fell short of cheap TV on the entertainment front and had precious little to offer as a history lesson.",6,0,1,23 August 2004
Braveheart," Inaccurate but highly entertaining historical tale.
","Circa 1300 a Scot by the name of William Wallace rises up against the tyranny that he sees all around him and fights the English for the freedom of his country.History and film are strange bedfellows. While opening up the eyes of the cinema-goer to events that they know nothing (or care little) about, they also open a debate about intent, motive and accuracy that can never be closed.No historical film ever made is accurate simply because all history is open to interpretation or being mis-recorded. Or even not recorded at all. Equally how can a three hour film take you back in time and hope to scratch the surface of the moral values and education levels of the day?We really know next to nothing about Wallace (the key source for this script is a poem!), but we know very little about Shakespeare either and he was a public figure living in the world's largest city. What chance has history got with a lowland (highland for cinematography reasons here) Scot?Certainly Wallace existed and certainly many of the battles presented here are real, but it plays Hollywood games with many of the key facts and at least one key romance is provably false. Thankfully it does portray the hard life of hard people with a certain amount of accuracy. (The IMDb Trivia and Goofs sections for this movie is an absolute must for understanding this film.)This is a big budget Hollywood film and having put up the money they have the right to call the tune. This includes scenes as ridiculous as riding in to a castle on horseback (how is this possible with drawbridges, etc.?) and having the said animal open the door with its front hooves! In the words of the joke, from then on the scene gets a bit silly. For the needs of America the film takes a twin-track approach to motivation: Wallace has reason to want personal revenge (I won't spoil it) as well as revenge for his countrymen for all the English have done to them. He is charged to the brim with outrage, although this point in history was actually a quiet period for English/Scottish hatred and maybe that is why so much fell on deaf ears.To make Wallace look better and more important, other key Scottish historical figures - such as Robert the Bruce - are shown to be weak if not outright weasels. An angle that seems to fly over the heads of Scottish Nationalists who champion the film.The medieval battle scenes are very frightening. Probably as accurate as anything that has been put down on film without making it a literal - rather than metaphorical - blood bath. The 'sixty pounds a day' Irish army (or reservists) going at it hammer and tong with only one or two looking like they are not very serious about it. The scenes with a fake horse and the incoming arrows is especially memorable. People say we (the English) are the bad guys here, but I cannot be really bothered. This is so far back in time it might as well be another planet. Rape, plunder and rough justice were probably viewed in a very different light by both sides in this argument.Gibson is really too old (and too short) for the lead role and as a result other roles have to be over-aged cast as well, including his wife Murron (Catherine McCormack) - who would probably be seen as middle-aged judged by the life expectancy of the day!However he directs well and keeps a balance between telling a story and simply entertaining the masses, winning the Best Picture Oscar with only his second effort behind the lens. His first film - The Man Without A Face - was as dreadful as this is good.",8,1,3,5 November 2004
The Breakfast Club," Kids spoilt rotten -- an American tragedy.
","Five students are brought in to detention on a Saturday ( the reason why is a spoiler) and what they get up to during that one day trapped in the school library.They are school joker Andrew Clark (played by Emilio Estevez), nerdy Brian Johnson (played by Anthony Michael Hall), school bully/wise-guy John Bender (played by Judd Nelson), rich snob Claire Standish (played by Molly Ringwald), and total head-case Allison Reynolds (played by Ally Sheedy).America, America. The home of the 'punishment of luxury.' Nearly every home have a car, most home's has several TVs, nearly every home has a fully stocked larder, but hey, they can be poor in their own way. Not material poverty, obviously but spiritual poverty. This film is about that -- people that don't believe in anything or want anything. Indeed they don't want anything because they have it all already and a soul can't be bought 'down at the mawwwl.' This bit of fluff was a hit in America, but is considered late night TV elsewhere. Proof that this means something to the USA. This three act morality play comes from that well known device of 'throw strange people together and truth will emerge.' Works in drama, but in real life all that happens is that people ignore each other or stick to their own -- like they do on a train journey.It also follows that drama convention of people being capable of sudden change. The ending is a complete hoot -- I've seen people change less in a stage hypnosis act! (Talking of change -- cop Molly Ringwald's hair! Seems to change between each and every shot. Who would have thought she could have so many hair styles in the one day!) The Breakfast Club is -- in summation -- a movie that is more interesting in its critical reaction than what happens on screen. Its far too cheap and cheerful to really please me and it also leaves you with the impression that destruction and soft drugs are a route to fun. This might be true -- for some -- but you don't have to advertise the fact.",6,3,8,12 March 2006
The Social Network," All films written by lawyers are really about lawyers.
","A bright social misfit (Mark Zuckerberg) becomes a billionaire by coming up with a new and radical way of communicating with friends and colleges through the internet. But was he the complete and total author?Before I even saw this film I congratulated David Fincher and his production team for even touching this theme. So recent a piece of social history. The protagonist has the deepest pockets imaginable - so the film is clearly guided by lawyers and legal advice. The usual flashback he said/she said bomb-proof air-raid shelter. Mostly based on court deposition.(Not only was the film virtually written by lawyers they feature on-screen more than they need to. Loyalty-free parasites - all of them!)I don't think many people will want to see this product twice and over time the (high) IMDb rating will shrink. Why? Because the soup is too thin. We know he did it - what we may not know is how he did it. Once this is learnt (in the broadest who-do-you-believe strokes) then there is not a lot to return to.Credit Jessie Eisenberg for playing a slightly autistic virgin loner who clings to the wall at parties, but clearly untrue. He not only had a girlfriend before his life went bang, but he is still with her today. Movie convention dictates that all programmers are geeky social misfits, usually wearing glasses held together with sticking plaster.(They stopped short of this here - but cliché is not avoided.)Programming is a slow business. Like working in treacle. To show his skill he hammers away like a speed typist. But most of programming is debugging. He never got it right first time. Although, to be fair, only programmers know this and the audience has no interest in such nuts-and-bolts.Quality acting by lead Eisenberg and especially good support from Justin Timberlake (as theft-is-good Napster 'founder' Sean Parker) who really is quite adept at playing flash character roles. Lost a lot of weight to make himself look younger.The movie contradicts itself is when it claims that Zuckerberg has no real interest in money. Especially when most of his actions show that he wants to cut the cake more-and-more in his favour and, earlier, makes himself scarce rather than having to lie. Cowards lying. Like Bill Gates (featured in cameo) I don't envy him because he is not cool and in reality money (above a certain level) cannot improve your life. Not unless your only ambition is to build a hospital in the Third World.Like many I came to this film looking for information and what I got was mostly opinion and spin. At worst it clinks and clangs in its ball-and-chain. However I was entertained for a couple of hours and that is - really - all we should ask of a film.",7,2,2,4 October 2011
Goodfellas," Martin Scorsese's Greatest Hit
","The life story of gangster from childhood to present day.The reason classic movies are so few and far between is that there is too much to go wrong. It is, after all, the most combined of the arts. But boy when the script, acting, music and direction come right you have the greatest art form in the world. I have sat and thought how I cannot give this movie 10 out of 10 - but I cannot find one, so 10 it is.(I had to break a my vow never to give a 10 to do this. After all how many things are perfect?  But it is a step better than my 9 movies, so what can I do?)It is ironic that Liotta - the central figure (Henry Hill) - in this drama is the least impressive and a class below both Pesci (he will never get a role as good as this) and De Niro (under acting here for once). Whether this is deliberate (so as to make it look less sexy?) I don't know. The Liotta movies that have followed have done nothing to to change my mind - although the role suits him right down to the ground so he is not doing any damage.(Can the guy play people of authority? Teachers, lawyers, government officials? In other words, people WITHOUT a screw loose?)De Niro doesn't have to do much in gangster roles. He is introduced - in voice over - as 28 and despite the fact that he is clearly in his 40's we don't care. His Jimmy 'the Gent' Conway is a slimeball crime figure, not that bright, but brighter than those around. What do they say: In the world of the blind the one-eyed man is king?Conway has worked out that it is easier to kill people than pay them the money he owes. He cannot knock the writer (Nicholas Pileggi) for this because it happens to be true. I could live without this fact being set to pop music though.Pesci won an Oscar for his Tommy Devito. This is the most amazing performance in the history of cinema: Deadly and funny at the same time. A complete acting master class and we are going to be seeing versions of this in movies forever. This role is to him what  the Zorba The Greek was to Anthony Quinn: To good to be played only once!The hyprocracy, stupidity, the viciousness, the black humour are all well done. Who else but director Scorsese would dare start with a scene that involves such callous violence? People that don't like this scene should stick to Disney movies, this is violence that is real and is based on a real incident. If some viewers prefer plastic violence, so what?
This might be the best piece of work that Martin Scorsese ever brings to the screen. Some comedians call it 'Martin Scorsese's Greatest Hits'. I call it Martin Scorsese's most perfectly realised picture.Oh there is one thing I don't like about it - the trailer is terrible and sells the picture as being pro violence.",10,0,0,12 October 2002
All the President's Men," The movie for all journalists and would-be journalists.
","The true story of how two minor journalists opened up a can of worms that led to the downfall of the President of the United States. A story almost too strange for fiction.The fact that the outcome is known to everybody watching doesn't seem to matter - it is a how-done-it rather than a who-done-it.The only thing I think is bad about the film is that is exposes some of the tricks of the journalists' trade!Hoffman and Redford (Carl Bernstien and Edward Woodward) don't give showy performances and they are not fleshed out off-the-job. Woodward wasn't a natural writer and despite having the scoop of anyone's lifetime hasn't really gone on to do anything other than write a trust-breaking biography of John Belushi. Despite the overall achievement what they printed wasn't entirely right. But that is a history book judgement and not one that we should dwell on. What they did get right is the fact that the other papers seems frightened of the story. They hung back until they were told it was safe to go in the water. Now the internet is one with the bravery!I also find it hard to fathom out Redford (Woodward) who is a Republican (so he says) and yet doesn't question that what he is doing to his own side. Who could have predicated what might have happened at the end of this story - rioting on the streets, the breakdown of law and order? Stranger things have happened.Jason Robards is perfect as the editor Ben Bradlee. There is a gravitas about him that doesn't need lines or dialogue. He is what they call in France 'the king actor' there is something about him that suggests that he is the main man without doing anything much to actually justify it. You either have it or you haven't. The expensive sets are brilliant too. The third part of a platonic love triangle. Just a big room with desks and people really. People hammering away. People laughing and joking. TV sets play to nobody or everybody. The lens stays sharp from front to back so as to get it all in. Newspaper offices are a place of constant distraction the writer has to block them out to in order to hammer out the story. This is the day of the typewriter so the noise must have been louder than it appears on film. The jigsaw doesn't come together quickly. Indeed they don't have a box cover to see what they are constructing. The Washington Post doesn't take them off the story as it gets bigger and bigger. Did others help? Surely they must have. Equally the lawyers (of both sides) must have been circling in real life. They are taking on government itself and that is something that everyone should be weary of. The end is a masterpiece. Probably the best ending in the entire history of cinema. It totally takes you off guard and runs against everything that you have been built up to expect. However the greatest ideas are often the simple ones.",8,6,9,2 April 2005
The Wizard of Oz," Campy fairy tale that is strangely heavy-handed.
","A whirlwind hits Kansas and carries a young girl in to a strange and mystical world.One of those products that you feel slightly stupid reviewing, but I guess a new audience for it is born every minute. Also it a good example of a book and film that, while joined at the hip, are also very different products. The book is light, throwaway and fun while the film gets very heavy and morose almost like a horror movie. Very strange for a film aimed at children.Judy Garland's life was one big rollercoaster ride from beginning to end and seemed to  involve an unfruitful search for happiness through people, produce and drugs. How apt that her most famous film should also feature a similar journey and how sad that while reading the script she could not take on the moral: That happiness comes from within and that life is what you make of it. Garland's talent was (and remains through film) immense. What a pair of lungs and what vocal control. A freak of nature that was plucked from nowhere, exploited and then thrown away by the studio system. She died young, but she had lived her show business life already and had no role left to play other than sing to ever dwindling gay audiences. Oz maybe a cruel place at times, but it is no more cruel than the real world it apes.Here we have main characters that are in search of change, but they are living in a 'cast' society in which function seems given by the state. Maybe I am thinking too literally, but how does Oz go round? Who paints the road yellow - and why? A road doesn't have to be completely painted to be followed and why brick, very expensive way to pave a road! Maybe examples of how nonsense stands out more in films.Maybe they thought that making this a musical would make it lighter and more fun. But it doesn't really work that way. Fun song and dance is one thing, but this hardly taking away the sense of danger and threat. Wicked witches are killers (or at least potential killers) so how can they be taken lightly or in jest? What is being demonstrated is that making the written page literal goes beyond the original intent. Children are meant to be slightly scared - not petrified as they would be watch this film.Legends have grown up around this film in production. From colour difficulty to the parties that the 'little people' threw after filming was done for the day. I am sure most of them are myths and besides, I am sure there is partying and sex after the end of most day's filming on most films.
In the Wizard of Oz we are transported to a strange world with great performances from all the leads, especially Garland who has to carry the weight of this giant production on her shoulders. I feel for her, where else is a child (or near child) expected to carry such responsibility but in show business? I guess the only world stranger than Oz is the world of show business. PS Do I get a cookie for not mentioning Over The Rainbow once in the main review?",7,2,5,17 February 2004
Rock Star," Like Spinal Tap never actually happened
","A famous heavy metal band recruit the lead singer of a tribute band to perform with them.Not a bad idea in theory and sort-of true in the case of Judas Priest and Oasis - for a short while at least, but this is not a movie but a cliche fest. This is amazing that it includes not only every rock cliche in the book (even TV set out of window is shown - TV-out-of-window for christ sake! TV-out-of-window is not even allowed in satire!), but every cliche involved in a rock musical film. If you have never seen any before and want to catch up on forty years of cinema buy your ticket now. This is just a compilation tape. And just when you thought you were safe, they steam in with another at the very end - 'funny' outtakes!What is there to say about Heavy Metal that hasn't be said a thousand times before and taken to pieces in Spinal Tap? Nothing. Boy dreams of fame - get fame - finds that fame is not what he thinks it is. No wait, wait. Boy becomes corrupted by fame? No, no, wait again. How about Boy gets fame as a rock star and is screamed at by thousands of girls, but all the time he secretly wants to play soft acoustic rock in an old pullover in a coffee bar? Marky Mark in a pully - no that was an out take that got put in by mistake surely!So how is the telling of the motley cliches? Well professional, but not that great. Aniston is not an actress, just a personality actress that got very very lucky. Here she wears a thong under a kind of knit dress and kisses a girl (I think anyway - who can tell in Heavy Metal), which I suppose is as wild as she gets. Maybe she will realise that Marky Marky has changed and no longer needs her ---- nooooooooooo, that would be too much of another rock and roll cliche.The last question - why are all rock managers English in these products? What is it about this country (mine) that makes them so ideal to be the fast talking fly-by-night 10 percenters? Maybe it is the accent that makes everything they say seem more real, correct and followable. 'Now Marky me-ladooo, drop your pants... That's it right down, now see that blender well pop your member in there.... There ya go, couldn't be better. Now reach down and press that green button with your left hand. That's it. Good boy. Ossie does it all the time - never goes on stage without doing it first.'",Null,1,4,28 January 2004
High Fidelity," Minor key movie - but funny because it is all true
","A thirty something  college dropout manages an almost-broke second hand record store in Chicago and laments (straight to camera) about loves found, lost and re-found against the background of his first love - pop music.Based on a classic book that was actually based in London this makes good use of John Cusack's sense of the droll and a small cast of likeable losers for whom he is the low-rent king. Equal thanks that it also has Jack Black as the smartass record store employee (paid for three days - turns up for six, therefore unsackable!) who doesn't have a life outside of  vinyl - or so it seems.This is a bit of different love story film because it surprises you. Girls are not just sitting by the phone waiting for the boy to call, indeed they have careers, interests and agendas. They might even be ahead in life.This is not a physical comedy, more a sound comedy - the mental torture of listening to Katrina and the Waves (Walking On Sunshine) at ultra high volume was the best joke of the whole movie. Closely followed by a cameo from a well known superstar.The great thing is that nothing really happens. No one is going to change much. This isn't a journey movie or if it is it is on a circular track. Cusack is merely learning that a cake once eaten disappears and that the things that matter in life and attract you to people are often trivial.Credit must go to book author Hornby who is one of life's great introspectionists, he says out loud (or rather in print) what we really think and feel and when we hear it our laugh is the laugh of recognition. This work is not as good as his first novel 'Fever Pitch' (about football), but works better as a film.High Fidelity is a small movie about big things. There is more to it than meets the eye, you think about it later and spot the central characters in real life. The central moral is that records and hobbies are great and let us all enjoy them for what they are, but they are not something we can put our arms around on a cold night or share feelings and emotions with.",7,0,1,1 January 2004
The Godfather," Great film making in a moral vacuum.
","A young Turk is asked to take over the family business. The only problem is that business is a franchise of New York's Murder Inc.The bones of the original Godfather have been so raked over that there doesn't seem a lot left of the corpse to examine. I almost passed on it until I read some of the other reviews which miss so many important points.Yes, great acting (Brando as the old Don and the Pacino as the new will never get better parts). Yes, great directing (Francis Ford Coppola). Yes, a great musical score (Nino Rota). But, nevertheless it is a film that won't quite a settle in my own mind. The information we are given on screen, while believable, is only a selected view of organised crime. I might even argue that it is a cop-out view.I saw this film as a child and was, then, unable to stand back and examine it as a whole. I wanted the cheap bang-bang, the stripped suits and the violin cases. I was bored by the central theme and thought that watching it (for three hours!) was a bit of a chore. Even today it is a bit slow, but I am now an adult and I can see all the things I missed first time around, not all of which flatters.Not that the central theme passed me by: The corruption of the innocent and the rights of passage. How many other people - other than Mafia sons - are born with a destiny? Members of the royal family, sure, but who else? Offspring's of Frank Sinatra (perhaps referred to, obliquely, in this movie) and Elvis Presley haven't even entered show biz no matter tried to take their father's crown. To tell such a story there is few other places that Director Francis Ford Coppola could go but to the mob.Here you have it all: Wealth, politics, extreme violence, corporate problems, the psychology of power, double standards: The whole world of lies, truths and half-truths all together in one place. They say the devil has all the best tunes, but he has a few good film scripts in his locker too.Coppola was nervous as a kitten back then. He introduces the characters in a good light and tries to highlight the good before we see the other side (and often it is not lingered on). He knows full well the audience could be lost before it is won. So no medals for bravery. We see the wealth and power, in clear visuals, but we don't see where the money comes from. Where are the beatings, the robbery and the drug addictions that the mob perpetrate?  The bricks and mortar of the  Long Island mansion that we see before us.The family is not involved in drugs (and is against them) says the old Don at a 'sit down'? How do we know? Crime is freelance, the only role of the mob is protection  of its members which means a share of the money they earn out of direct sight.(You could say that this sight-unseen street crime puts the cotton wool in Marlon Brando's mouth!)Pornography and vice he doesn't have a problem with - although we don't see it and don't, in the main, care. Women are just another commodity 'that corporations cannot provide.'Killing seems to be sacred (a theme we see repeated in this series). Pacino doesn't have to kill (it wouldn't have been beyond his wits to have the job done by others) but does so. As a vengeful killer he is real deal - as a non killer he is the baby-faced 'college boy'.The film does little for women. They are all hand-wringers or professional lookers of the other way. Either that or victims. OK feminism wasn't around back then, but good actresses such as Talia Shire and Diane Keaton don't have a memorable line between them.Many of the faults of the first part were put right in the second. We see how power was taken (not given) through the barrel of a gun and some of the home truths that Godfather (Part One) tiptoes around. Nevertheless three hours is a lot of screen time not to have a few minutes to look at what these people leave behind - namely innocent victims...",9,3,7,2 October 2002
