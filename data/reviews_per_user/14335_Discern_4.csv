The Legend of Bagger Vance," What might have been
","This is a film with a wonderful, potential storyline that gets thoroughly bogged down with poor screenplay and distracting fantasies.  Matt Damon, in the title role, is thoroughly unconvincing as a supposed champion golfer, allowing Joel Gretsch (as Bobby Jones) to completely dominate their shared moments on screen.  Joel, himself, would have been an excellent choice for the lead role.  Will Smith gives his usual competent performance, but is handicapped by a series of fantastic, surreal fantasies that clearly demonstrate the dangers of having non-golfers make films about golf. Perhaps, after a suitable waiting period, this story may be 'rediscovered' and remade by more competent production and acting teams.",Null,1,3,29 July 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," After a big buildup, a real disappointment
","After reading all the rave reviews for this movie, it turned out to be a real disappointment.  Can anyone really believe that the prisoners are honourable men while the guards and warden are all 'crooks'??  Haven't we overdone the hypocritical 'Bible thumper'?? -- let's find a more enlightened characterization.  James Bond, himself, could not have followed the main character's escape plan.  The ending soliloquy and denouement were inferior plagiarisms from 'Cool Hand Luke'.  Enough!!!  Unfortunately, fine performances by both Robbins and Freeman were wasted in this 'fantasy' story.",1,45,156,23 March 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Gimics Gimics, and More Gimics
","If this were a rating of technical achievement, 'Star Wars' would rank very high  -- with state-of-the-art animation and groundbreaking visual imagery. But lack of any discernible character development (let alone acting) leaves an icy-cold dissatisfaction.  Indeed, the only character with an ounce of 'humanity' is the robot.  It's ashame that today's younger generation is being so short-changed by the shallowness of our entertainment offerings.",1,21,70,23 March 1999
The Godfather," Violence, Violence and more Violence
","A ponderously slow moving script interspersed with vulgar blood and guts scenes.  After about 20 minutes of this tripe I wanted to drop a bomb in the middle and wipe out the whole lot of them -- for the good of humanity.  With few exceptions (Pacino) the acting was also of low caliber.  All the money spent on the sets, costumes, and backdrops could not make up for the lack of any direction or purpose to the main storyline.",1,17,70,26 March 1999
