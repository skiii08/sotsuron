The Mask," I'm glad no one stopped him...
","Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.It's really good to see some of the origins of Jim Carey's wacky film styling, and I personally like this much better than 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'.There are layers to this that keep it interesting. The mystery of the mask itself, what happens to Ipkiss, the romantic story lines: they all get progressed and slowly revealed throughout the movie, and whether or not the answers are what we want, we get them. More importantly, we're not just given answers to make way for the action. The information is drip-fed at a decent pace so the audience can enjoy the scene and then shift focus afterwards.There also has a lot of the same feeling here that one may get from 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' where cartoons exist in the real world, so there is a technical feat accomplished here that could have drastically changed the movie.",7,0,0,3 July 2020
The Hangover," I sure like me some Hangover...wait...
","Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.This is such a brilliantly idiotic movie, but it has a beautiful technical execution in investigating the mystery and drip feeding information to not only the audience, but the characters themselves.I can't stress how masterfully this movie pulls the most ridiculous situations, one after the next.",8,1,2,4 April 2020
As Good as It Gets," As Good as it is
","Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.I might just be a sucker for a neurological disorder flick, but there are so many depths to this movie about our capabilities as people, control, and seeking our goals vs our comforts.If you need proof that Jack Nicholson or Helen Hunt are top actors, then get in the way back machine and see how they did a 'serious', but funny movie in the late nineties.This one has a little bit of everything, definitely worth checking out.",8,0,0,17 June 2020
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Kristen Bell would make a great detective
","Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.I've never remembered this as a good movie, but always a funny movie. On this last watch, I definitely feel it meets both now: maybe I'm just relating more to Jason Segel than usual.Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Russell Brand make for fantastic immediate support cast, and there is a slew of wonderful people after that, all with fantastic moments creating many well balanced story threads.Honestly, the setting was irrelevant, the story could have happened anywhere, and past that, Paul Rudd's Character was the worst thing about this movie, and when the worst thing is something Paul Rudd did, then you know you have a pretty good movie on hand.The movie is representational of the hangups and baggage we have and the fear / motivation there is in resolving them. What's more, this is a really funny movie with humor high and low.",8,0,0,2 July 2020
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," I hope the Icelanders like this better than I did.
","Decent watch at best, I don't want to see it again, and I can't recommend it unless you just like laughing at foreigners.Imagine....Pitch Perfect, with middle age characters, but instead of the 90% of somewhat interesting or even bland characters, the movie is centered around the 10% of annoying (potentially offensive) stereotypical characters you could have written out of the movie. I don't know if the producers just thought, 'What's whiter than Iceland' and figure it was okay to make fun of them for an entire movie, but that's pretty much what they did.I can't say if it's accurate, I don't have a lot of Icelandic jokes in my pocket, but SO MANY people had to endorse this that it is just sad this was made. This could have been a great American Idol style of movie, none of the nationalistic humor was necessary.They took the 'Off the bus from Kansas' trope, and set it in Europe, barely anything particular to it, let alone special.Don't get me wrong, the singing is all great, but that's what audio programs are for, and they certainly had the budget to go the extra mile with this one.The writing is actually pretty good in this, it's just coated in herring (see, that's probably a Swedish joke).I'd really like to see an American version of this so we can let two top notch stars like Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams loose and not have to feel bad about it.",4,2,12,29 June 2020
Knives Out," Best mystery I've seen since Clue
","Great watch, will eventually watch again, and can recommend.Finally! A mystery movie that I can even compare to Clue (go watch that too). This reminds me a lot of what the detective from 'Murder on the Orient Express' is supposed to be.One of the things that really makes this stand out as a 'dinner theater' piece, is that almost everyone is unredeemable. Instead of everyone is innocent until proven guilty, everyone is presented as a guilty (as a suspect, at least from an audience stand point), and we have to piece together the clues as we're drip-feed information.And as the movie continues, it reminds you where you might not have been paying attention, rehashes events in the logical manner that is required, in case you hadn't followed, to prove the case (again, baring semblance to 'Clue'), and every detail and every minute of the movie is intriguing.I'm looking forward to the 2nd watch to see if the re-watchability holds up.",8,1,6,13 June 2020
Rise of the Guardians," Not the Avengers, but it'll do.
","Good watch, might watch again, can recommend.As someone who's not particularly a big fan of these holiday characters, it was refreshing to see these battle-ready versions of them.Incorporating Jack Frost as a character actually makes a lot of sense, as literally pointed out in the movie that he's an underrated holiday figure.Adding to the holiday-verse with backstories and belief as power with multiple forms is also an interesting touch.The cg animation is very well done, and the writing is actually very intricate. The antagonist does a very classic job of slowly breaking down the hero squad and its done extremely well.The key is in the details, and this one has enough to give it a watch.",7,0,0,10 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Rise of the original nerds on this one
","Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.Now, for the original fans of the space wizards, I can understand that this isn't their cup of tea anymore. The pacing of the originals was slow and dramatic with small things being revolutionary, and this lots and more to the same computer powered fast paced cinematic magic.For everyone, the pacing is a little all over the place, and the importance of locations vary wildly. The movie itself is oddly long and rushed: almost they they were going to split it into multiple movies but decided it had to be one movie.That all said, none of that particularly matters to me. We have great characters on an epic adventure against a indomitable foe with really good development (mostly). The actors all know their characters well, the effects are great and it looks good.That said, the big climax is kind of nonsense: there is a sloppy reveal, a weak redemption, a SHODDY premise, and just an odd choice of final moments.The 7-9 trilogy is definitely flawed, and it wouldn't be anything without 4-6 (probably fine without 1-3), but 7-9 is probably what I'm going to rewatch. And all those numbers show what this should be, a series, a series of movies, maybe, but there are a rich number of stories here that don't deserved to be rushed or forgotten.",8,6,22,5 May 2020
Hot Rod," A father son story for the ages
","Decent watch, may watch again, and can recommend if you like Samberg's humor.I'm not a huge fan of Samberg, or Danny McBride, flavor of humor, but they have their moments, and Bill Hader and Isla Fisher are under used in this.Samberg has a jarring, manic 'what kind of crazy thing will happen next' flavor to his humor and the movie is filled to the brim with it: particularly his eternal streetfight with his stepdad.",6,0,0,30 March 2020
Bad Teacher," Wish I had teachers this bad
","Decent watch, unlikely to watch again, and hard to recommend.I'm not the biggest fan of Cameron Diaz or Lucy Punch, but their over dramatic styling (in this movie) contrasting with an (overly) laid back attitude from the gentleman co-stars really works for this passive aggressive teach war.None of it makes a lot of sense, but for an unlikable protagonist, the story does a lot with her doing good, if for the wrong reasons.This brings up a somewhat subtle philosophical debate on morality, but I don't think this movie was necessarily designed for that. If anything, then its questioning personal motivation.I feel I had to try to really hard to find substance in this one, but if you want something where you can turn your brain off, this'll do.",6,0,0,10 June 2020
No Strings Attached," I wish this was a problem I had....
","Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.Having just watch 'Friends with Benefits' this feels like a drastically different movie: mostly on the basis that this is more about a neurotic woman's control issues extending into the fear of rejection and emotional pain. Not that it's wrong to be guarded in her manner, it's just that is what you call that.Now, I've basically been in love with Natalie Portman since 'Leon: The Professional', and have only liked Ashton Kutcher in 'Butterfly Effect' (wildly polarized opinions on the movie) and 'A Lot Like Love' (I hate baseball, and only seem to really like Amanda Peet in baseball themed video), so I had to ignore just being angry at him most of the movie.The other significant difference between 'Friends with Benefits' is that this has an amazing supporting cast, and a story past 'my crazy dad'. And in that support cast, there are examples of different types of women (and men) archetypes. Greta Gerwig was basically (eventually) the perfect woman, very appreciated, where Lake Bell was appreciative, but with 'quirks', and either would have fine women / options if the world actually worked like that so reciprocate that appreciation if you have it.But, of course, the story focuses on emotionally elusive control freak, and I'll admit a certain appeal to that. And the independent part of that is the appealing part, but how that character became an (almost) doctor and has it together is by avoiding the problems that she's having with Adam, and that only works so far when it's already there, which is what most of the movie is about: a woman being emotionally brave (there is no bravery without fear), and even thought it seems to be told from Adam's perspective (mostly), he doesn't have much going on other than sexing Emma in terms of adversity. The one thing that happens is quickly resolved because someone else wants to sex him, where as she is in a continuous state of confrontation.While both movies have this light hearted air to them about the complexities of relationships 'Friends with Benefits' almost seems cute compared to the adventures of this movie. Not everyone is going to deep dive on a movie like I will though, so I can't say this is a wildly great movie: it's still about pretty people having sex and complaining about it, so it loses some of the steam there.",7,0,0,5 July 2020
Ex Machina," When do they go to market though?
","A great watch, will watch again, and definitely recommend.This is such a mind stimulating movie, and without exhausting me as I feel sometimes: instead of forcing you to comprehend things, it allows you to explore flights of fancy and possibility.The casting is amazing, most of the movie is only Domhnall Gleeson (Star Wars: General Hux), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: Poe Dameron), and most of all Alicia Vikander (Tomb Raider). They all play really well off of one another, and Eva's execution had to just perfect. Given that Alicia is covered in green screen suit to allow for the amazing cg effects of Eva's body, Alicia had to make Eva's role as a machine believable for the audience, and for Caleb.This is also my biggest gripe, Eva wastes movement like a human would, it is designed to pretend to think, act, and move as if a human would: it's an infiltration unit. An A.I. doesn't need to take 3 steps and half-turn it's head to the human it's talking to: that's specifically done for a desired effect. Eva treats itself as lesser for the sake of the humans, which is realistic enough, but the result is something I don't feel is realistic, and when we actually create androids like this, they wont' take considerations like 'looking directly at a human' when conversing without extreme training on the matter.Past that one thing, the premise, the execution, the dilemma of this is amazing, down to the last scene. The movie even directly addresses some of the controversy of the situations they're experiencing as it carries an odd, tech-involved philosophical edge.There is a lot of smart movie here, and some might be 'cool', but I think most people are not going to be able to appreciate this properly.",8,0,0,7 July 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Jedi are like chips, you can always make more
","Not being a big fan of most of the Space Wizard franchise, I really like the newer movies (E7, Rogue One).Not only does this have a great production value and great directorial choices: the actors are perfect for their roles.The writing is fairly good, the worst bits being the classic Space Wizards stuff where entire civilizations are being commanded because some super powered teen is cranky.Sure it has some problems, but is overall very good and I not only look forward to the sequel, but watching it and the 7-9 trilogy again.",8,3,15,5 May 2020
Jurassic World," Parks, uh.....find a way
","Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.Being that its not the original Jurassic Park, it's marvelous. Its actually good to see a continuation of the things we love instead of heartless reboots, made for merchandise.Starting over with a new park really feels like the way to go, and allowing corporate interference to be the catalyst to this movie's disaster sequence.The animals are all done super well, even if they're not the practical masterpieces of the original movie. The Indominus Rex remind me of a big killer dog, which helps turn down some of the graphic quality of the violence for me.Its definitely worth the watch, and (Pratt racing raptors aside) I'm actually excited just writing about it.",8,0,1,10 June 2020
The Hangover Part II," Again? They did this again?
","Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.It is amazing they were able to pull this off twice at such a high quality.They even managed to introduce an old character as a new character to help keep the story fresh alongside a Thailand setting.",8,1,2,4 April 2020
Friends with Benefits," I want to see the movie that Jason Segal and Rashida Jones did
","Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.From the very beginning we're overwhelmed with the pretty people that are Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake (and a confusing moment where he would dump Emma Stone), and their 'horrible' problem of finding so many partners that sadly don't work out that they just decide to bang, and because (clearly) sex, communication, and openness are not problems for these two it solves their needs. Now the obvious flaw in this is that nulling emotion to achieve these other things isn't actually possible, what we're removing is the social inhibitions: they just did it arbitrarily.If the entire movie wasn't about how the thing that they're trying to avoid is inevitable, then I would say that it was actually somewhat progressively leading towards a world where social expectations didn't lead our romantic encounters, but we did, however long they may or may not be.The clear problems lie in both the biology of a woman having to carry the child (though not necessarily THE woman, but that causes issues as well), and the egotism that leads people to attempt to control the entire situation because of a biological tick: i.e. when one is 'suddenly' ready to have a baby, those hormones prevent considering if the other person involved wants that, and don't necessarily open one's mind to having the baby elsewhere.Part of that is the design of passing genes forward, and the rest is social conventions: i.e. it's a very complicated problem.Back to the movie, it's a lot of fun, it's funny, it's sexy (they're naked and pressed against each other like a 3rd of the movie), but it's not deep because being deep on these topics isn't palatable, see above or the 3rd act of the movie.I think the people that will truly relate to all of this movie wouldn't watch this movie, but there are likely parts you'll relate to or at least enjoy.",6,0,0,5 July 2020
Zombieland," Zombieland is my retirement plan
","Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.A great cast, fantastic performances, great production on everything: some of the details really make the scenes.I really enjoy the style of this and the buddy cop setup in a zombie apocalypse.",8,0,0,4 April 2020
The Holiday," I'd switch houses with you for the holiday
","Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.This is a great parallel stories movie. Think of it dueling pianos but as movies for a romantic comedy.Everyone does a great performance, the timing and writing is solid, and the movie is heart warming and touching.Jack Black really shows he CAN do a more serious role when he's finally done playing silly.Honestly, the only real problem I have is that Shannyn Sossamon got such a small part (Maggie).",8,0,0,24 April 2020
Saving Mr. Banks," We all knew Walt was evil
","Great watch, could watch again, and can recommend, but having recently watched 'Mary Poppins' may alter the experience.I have just watched 'Mary Poppins', a wonderful movie, before this so the magic that Disney pumped into Travers' story is still fresh in my mind. I'm not saying that Disney didn't create something fantastic, but I'm struggling with my affinity for this story.I think this is a great movie that documents an important event in both Disney and film history, and certainly that of intellectual property. I'm just not sure anyone else sees the same movie that I see in 'Saving Mr. Banks', a title that I don't agree with at all, other than the victors of wars write history: I would have titled this the pursuit of 'Mary Poppins'.If you just change some of the music around, then you would have quite the psychological thriller on hand. The movie is filled with Disney hunting Travers, sorting out how to manipulate her in different ways, what to hide from her. He even has idiot minions that nearly ruin it for him. There's elements at play all over, she's brought out of her native environment, EVERYONE she interacts with is paid by Disney: they have a vested interest in keeping him happy, especially since he's not used to being refuted.20 years, a man pursued a woman that said no. 20 years, and she finally hit a wall and was low on funds enough that she could be convinced to deal with a kingdom of frivolity, and she had to sell a part of herself to him, even though she didn't want to, assured one thing, lied to, and having to make concessions the entire way. The audacity of going to someone, asking to buy their invention, and then belittling it so much that you reinvent it to the point it isn't recognizable as the thing you bought: it would have been so much easier to simply create something from scratch.This movie actually embodies everything I hate about the MCU, even in the early 1960s, it was enough to take a name that people recognized (and nothing else) and exploit it to make money off of it with no regards to the original work or author. And it is the fault of the authors, the owners of the intellectual property to sign away the rights without securing right of refusal or final approval. And it is the fault of the studio to exploit those in dire need as if they would buy a product that couldn't be sold as is.PL Travers was the hero of this story, and she lost to Disney, to need, to greedy capitalism, and I wish more people would take her advise of 'Never again!'.I think, in the end, this movie creeps me out, and makes me sad about the world. As good as it is, I can't say I enjoy it in retrospect.",8,0,0,28 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great start to a new thing based off the old thing
","Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.I understand that classic Star War fans will hate the new trilogy (and after the Prequels, its understandable that they would be scared), but I was never a big 'Space Wizards' fan, so adding some action to some fresh characters in the same great universe was the way to go for me.Daisy Ridley and John Boyega do an amazing job, and Adam Driver does a decent job of making me hate Kylo Ren.Giving a new feel on an old formula is honestly an art form, and I think they nailed it.While I wish they had covered more about the Sith during a point of obvious advantage, I'm sure the expanded universe stories will eventually cover the Sith.",8,1,9,11 May 2020
The Hangover Part III," Wolfpack 3, not quite Ocean's Eleven
","Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.This is the one that diverges from the previous formula, and suffers, if slightly for it.While this has plenty of ridiculous events, it loses the mystery aspect that kept the interest up. This becomes more of a pauedo mystery and more of a heist / gangster movie. Almost a like a Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.The end of this one hints at a more spiritual sequel and I can't wait to see that.",8,0,1,4 April 2020
