The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Perfect music/actors/everything.
","I'll start off by saying, I have never read this book. All I had heard about this movie was that it was terrible. (I know right!?) Fortunately, that made me even more curious.I must say, 'pleasantly surprised' is an understatement.The story was obviously well written (due to its fame.) as it consistently conjures the viewers' own real life memories of moments when we were happy. The character of Charlie is the best thing about this story. His shy demeanor only makes him even more charming. Logan Lerman was perfect for this role.. I think it is his naturally sad eyes... and I am now obsessed with him.This book was almost begging to be made into the film due to the many mix-tape scenarios which led to a wonderful soundtrack. Watch this movie. too good to miss.",9,0,1,22 February 2013
