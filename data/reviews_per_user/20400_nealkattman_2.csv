","I'll keep it brief... Unlike so many others I've seen on this filmIf you gave this movie a smidgen less than 10 stars, you're either BRAIN DEAD or unforgivably STUPID. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are master's of their craft. I mean an ACTOR playing an ACTOR who isn't that good of an ACTOR. But just through something unforseen becomes a great ACTOR. Jeeeeezuz that's crazy good stuff.Pitt wouldn't have been on my radar to play this part if I'd only known the script. That's why he's. Sooooooo freaking good at his job...
