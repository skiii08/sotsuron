Hereditary," If you liked Babadok and/or Mother! You'll love this
","Bonkers but in a great way. I can see why some people didn't enjoy this. A slow builder with an ending that some people, at the showing I went to, were laughing at. 
Just like mother! and babadok this deserves/needs multiple viewing and has had me thinking about it ever since I saw it. 
It had some great, un-nerving images. A great horror. Not a slasher or torture porn but a psychological drama with horror overtones. Loved it.",9,27,56,17 June 2018
