The Devil's Advocate," Not a legal thriller, but a morality tale *spoilers*
","Taylor Hackford directs this big budget morality tale with the sure hand of a storyteller.  Keanue Reeves is a much better actor than people give him credit for.  If you watch most of his performances carefully, he is creating spaces for the other actors to work in.  That is a sure sign of talent. It's a shame most people are quick to jump on the 'I hate Keanu' bandwagon, perhaps it is jealousy.  Anyway, Keanu plays a hotshot Florida lawyer who never loses a defense case - as it turns out, there was a hole in the wall between the mens room and the jury deliberation room.  That means he knew he was getting his clients, who we can only assume to be guilty-as-heck dirtbags if we are to go by the films opening sequence, off on charges he knew they were guilty for.  That makes him the titled 'Devils Advocate' because advocate literally means 'to plead in favor of'.  He was pleading in favor of men he knew were evil, in essence, this makes him evil too.  The entire film is revealed to be a morality struggle going on inside the head of his character... can he look himself in the mirror when he knows deep inside of himself the consequences of what he is about to do?  Kudos to the production team and cast and crew for making a highly entertaining morality tale.",Null,0,1,14 September 2003
Scarface," Vastly entertaining crime flick
","Brian DePalma directs Al Pacino in a tour de force performance as Tony Montana, cuban crime lord.  This film is infinitely quotable, with just about every line that Pacino spouts in his thick psuedo-cuban accent an instant classic.  The film has 206 utterances of the 'f' word, a record at the time that was not to be eclipsed until 'Pulp Fiction' in 1995, which is a weak and boring film, in my opinion.  'Scarface' is not a five star masterpiece, but keeps going steadily until the violent, action packed finale where we get to say hello to Tony's little friend!",Null,0,1,29 September 2003
Minority Report," The Terminally Boring
","I recently sat down to watch this movie again more closely, and decided to re-write my review. In specific, to clarify on why I don't like it at all. It's because Steven Spielberg has the skill to make a movie that will really knock you on your ass. These days, an intelligent movie is almost certain to get an R rating, because the character of Tom Cruise is a Philip K. Dick character. This guy wrote stories where almost every time, the main character was tripping out in his own head as a different person, experiencing things and discovering things along the way, and so do we along with him. This trick is briefly explored, but in the end it doesn't matter anyway, because it was decided this film had to be a PG-13 hero saves the day family entertainment type of film, the demographic that Spielberg has catered to all for almost all of his career.The visual style they are trying to use here, which involves extensive use of a blue filter on the lens, really doesn't look pleasing to the eye. In fact, the film is rather ugly to look at, the design is unimaginative. A noir film is filmed at night! When you film at day, and put a blue lens on your camera to make it dark anyway, it doesn't make sense. Has anyone reading this article seen a movie called 'And God Spoke'? It's a fake documentary where two idiot z-level direct to video filmmakers decide to make a film about the bible because 'it's the biggest best seller of all time, the biggest target audience.' During the production, they decide to hire a polish cinematographer who is obsessed with Sven Nykvist. He thinks if he films exactly like Sven Nykvist, who is famous for his creative uses of dark lenses in brilliantly lit scenes, he will be like Sven Nykvist. He idolizes the man. When they film the garden of eden sequence, it's a cheap production, they barely have any lights, but the cameraman has put very dark lenses on the camera to be like Sven Nykvist. The end result is, they can't see anything, it's too murky and dark. He wasted several hundred thousand dollars in re-shoots in overruns. The point is, Minority Report is so boring that's how I was able to think of this connection. Doesn't Spielberg know that history grinds away at hacks?When the plot can be summed up as 'you used the memory of my dead son to set me up'... that is awful writing. I would expect that kind of writing in an Edward Bulwer-Lytton junk writing contest.",1,4,8,18 August 2003
L.A. Confidential," The point of noir is that there are no innocents
","The 'limp-wristed' character of Matt Reynolds is supposed to be Tab Hunter, who was outed by the tabloid press in 1955. The spin with this movie is that Paul Guilfoyle (II), is the son of Paul Guilfoyle, the veteran character actor who got Tab Hunter his big break, so to speak. The Television show is obviously supposed to be Dragnet. It's all an illusion, as we are to learn, because of the vast level of corruption of the city and the cities forces. The movie is supposed to be taking place in the past but its also simultaneously taking place in the present as there are actors and lights and cameras, and such. This is what took place when they made the movie in the late '90s, as they told a story of something that happened in the '50s and is still happening.Russell Crowe gave a standout performance and dominates the movie. Everyone roots for him for the most, I suspect. He is really is proving that he understands acting as reaching a psychological archetype of that character. The best actors are coming out of Australia, and I find that interesting, as it indicates a shift of some sorts in film-making. Film-making is getting more and more self-referential. You can't get any more self-referential than this film, because of the Paul Guilfoyle connection. It's right there to read into to, and I think it's a daring thing for a major motion picture to do. This film will continue to have a long afterlife.",10,0,3,3 November 2005
Sleepy Hollow," A strange, comical, creepy and delightful film
","The ever reliable Tim Burton and Johnny Depp reunite for 'Sleepy Hollow', a comical update of the Washington Irving story filmed in the style of the '70s Hammer horror films.  It even has Hammer horror legend Christopher Lee in a cameo.  I would never have thought Johnny Depp could possible upstage his strange performance as Edward Wood, Jr. in 'Ed Wood' but he outdoes himself here as Ichabod Crane, man of science, and absolute sissy.  I have no idea what inspiration he used for this performance but the way he delivers his lines is a hoot. Christina Ricci - what can I say?  She plays her part very well and I found myself falling in love with her, although I don't think she pulls off the blonde look very well, it no way does it take away from her performance. Rounding out the cast are the usual Burton players and dependable genre character actors.  Casper Van Diem acquits himself very nicely and getting Ray 'Darth Maul' Park to play the Headless Horseman was a stroke of genius. I give this film 3.8 stars out of 5.",Null,1,2,30 September 2003
MASH," 10 out of 10 - spoilers
","Before SAVING PRIVATE RYAN tried, and failed, to be the greatest war movie ever made, there was M*A*S*H*. Sometimes the blackest comedy, sometimes a serious drama, it will never bore you. Tom Skerritt proves why he is one of the most sought after character actors in film today, along with Donald Southerland and Eliot Gould. They play three army doctors on the front lines of the korean war, but the movie winks at us with allusions to Vietnam. They know that their services are indispensible, so they basically take over the camp and do whatever they please. Their first victim is the hypocrite Major Burns, played by Robert Duvall, who is passive/aggressive only the way Robert Duvall can be. By day, he is teaching bible lessons and moralizing, but by night, he is trying to get into Hot Lips pants. It isn't long before he has to go, leaving our heroes free to womanize, drink, and smoke grass. Don't let the hijinks fool you, they are fine and dedicated surgeons. They're just trying to keep their sanity in an insane situation.",10,3,8,11 October 1999
Alien," Still Scott's finest movie
","I have this little theory... that talented filmmakers often do their best work (notice I said talented?) with their first couple of features.  If the talent shows any promise, the film gets noticed, makes money, wins a few awards.  When you've got nothing left to prove, you lose that hunger that drives you for success, the hunger that only lets you get 3 hours of sleep each day, the hunger that gives you that attention to detail over every little thing.  'Alien' is truly the work of an artist obsessing over every little detail and nuance.  The set design, cinematography (Adrian Biddle, one of the great british cameramen), special effects and visual effects (considering it was the late '70s) are all top notch.Scott, who ironically would come to be known in the 80's for his cleverness with chiascuro (thanks to such insipid tripe as 'Legend' and 'Someone to Watch Over Me'), willingly settled into his director-for-hire mode that he remained in until breaking out with 'Gladiator', truly a stunningly epic film, despite the limitations of the screenplay which was basically a revenge or die story.'Alien' takes it time, long and leisurely, setting up the character development, the arc of the plot, and slowly turns up the intensity to the scary climax.  The film has aged somewhat, due in no small part to Cameron's sequel 'Aliens', which owes more to Heinleins novel 'Starship Troopers' than it does to Scott's 'Alien'.  This film has haunted my imagination since I first saw this film when I was 13 years old... The cinematic themes of dark betrayal, such as the corporation of the film essentially using the crew of the Nostromo as a 'mule' for the Alien, were still new to me.  Perhaps I had too much time on my hands, but I often would think about how Ripley said if they had brought the creature on board, then they would all have had to spend time in quarantine upon their return to Earth.  Then, in a dark moment of mabacre creativity, I realized perhaps the company had created the alien through genetic engineering themselves, sent it out to that planet, and then planned to use the Nostromo crewmembers to bring back the Alien species to Earth to use as a form of biological warfare.  It kind of puts a neat twist on the film, since they never did explain where exactly that crashed spaceship (The 'space jockey' creature) came from.",Null,0,1,23 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Emperor has no clothes
","EPII is frequently on HBO, so having had the chance to watch it about a hundred million times, I have finally developed the courage to admit to myself, that this is truly a bad movie.  George Lucas has to be one of the most incompetent filmmakers in the history of filmmaking. 
Why, oh why couldn't this movie be as good as the final swordfights at the end?  The camera dances, the action flows, the tension and excitement are palpable.  Then I found out that those scenes were filmed on the same stage as 'Moulin Rouge', using the same crew.  Rumours abound that the bearded one refused to return to the land of Oz for the pickup shots of EPIII, instead preferring to return to England.  Perhaps the laughter of derision behind his back had finally gotten to him?I really don't care about EPIII anymore.  If it's good, or if it's bad. Lucas once again wrote the screenplay without any outside help, so it's almost certain to be bad.  I leave it up to you to determine if the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan swordfight is worth a 10-12 dollar admission ticket.Here is what I have to say to you all:  vote with your wallet.  Do not go to see EPIII.  Lucas treats his audience with contempt, why not give him some payback where it would really hurt?",2,1,2,23 July 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Desperate act of a desperate man
","I saw Attack of the Clones at the midnight screening at Union Station, Washington DC.  All I have to say is this... it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.  I found the 'screenplay' on-line and couldn't believe George Lucas actually had the gumption to film that trite!  Let's re-hash some facts...What made the original trilogy, or in my mind, Episode IV and Episode V so great?  The influence of Gary Kurtz and Larry Kasdan, respectively.  Darth Digitalgeekus...oops I mean Mr. Lucas is so fond of saying 'these are my movies, these are my movies' but it was the creative input and counterbalance to Darth Digitalgeekus that made those two movies so great. What you have now is a billionaire, surrounded by 'yes-men' and art directors who just don't get it (Joe Johnson, where have you gone? you are missed) and what the result is... is a train wreck of a film.
Mr. Lucas seems to have a good idea with the prequels... but has completely gotten off the point by filling the movie with mindless, trivial details instead of a coherent plot and story.  Not to mention the fact he utterly ruined the character of Yoda, one of the greatest screen characters of all time, turning him from a thoughful teacher and philosopher into a jackie chan caricacture simply because he realized what a dud his movie was to begin with.  Don't believe me, read the interviews... to paraphrase him 'if we couldn't pull of the yoda fight, we had no movie'.  One scene does not make a movie.  A three-act story with a character arc is what makes a movie. If you ever needed to see what happens with one-manship, look no further than Star Wars Episode II, Attack of the Clones, the worst movie of the year.",2,1,2,9 June 2002
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Robin Williams is clean shaven, it must be a comedy
","This movie has just one good part - In the first act, when Robin Williams does his first DJ gig in Vietnam and adlibs the entire thing.  After that, there is just nothing noteworthy about this film that rises it above 'movie of the week' material.  Robin Williams and his irreverency against the Department of Defense.  Ah, the zaniness!  Williams and Levinson would later team up again for the even more unwatchable, 'Toys'.",Null,0,2,9 September 2003
The Village," we are the village
","Night has held up the mirror to our faces and we see the reflection. My congratulations to Mr. Phoenix for his interpretation of a true heart. It made the stabbing scene that much more poignant for me. What Night is trying to say here, in case you are dense, is that we are the village and the elders use fear to control our actions and thoughts. Which is probably why the movie got so much negative word of mouth, Americans tend to dis-like it when they contemplate what could be the true nature of our existence. Reference Plato's 'The Cave' for further information, if you dare! Ms. Howard was in particular very excellent in what could very well be the leading role. Would it not be possible that a blind girl would be the only one with enough courage to do what needs to be done? Ms. Howard has a very bright light shining inside of her.",10,1,2,6 April 2005
Cold Mountain," Not nearly 'Minghella' enough for me
","Never before have I been so bewildered by a movie before, a movie that is by equal terms laughably bad and awe-inspiring. The opening battle scene is one of the best I have ever seen filmed (although the question of how Inman's Indian friend survived the knife fight with the black Union soldier when it clearly shows he was about to get the sharp end of it), and the reflection of fighting soldiers in the bloody mud puddle with a blood-drenched Union flag on the ground was a nice touch.The problem I had with the film (notice I did not say, 'the problem with the film' props to me!) is that, crowd-pleasing moments and Minghella-type storytelling do not mesh. Rumours abound that Boss Weinstein had too large a hand in this production in his zeal for the annual Oscar campaign. The deft artistic risk-taking and touches that Minghella lovingly placed on 'The English Patient' and 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' are few and far between in 'Cold Mountain'.Ms. Natalie Portman is of particular notice, she gives an excellent supporting performance in her all-too brief screen time, and the sexual tension between her and Mr. Law clearly overshadows the tension that Inman and Ada were supposed to have. It just goes to show that some things cannot be faked.I must point out Robert Altman's excellent film 'McCabe + Mrs. Miller' on how to properly film a period movie, much less a Western. In that film, you can literally feel the dirt and grime oozing out of everything. The actors have real dirt on their face, clothes, and under their nails, not movie makeup. I only mention this because its the inappropriate use of makeup in this film that distracted me from fully immersing myself in the story. For example, when Ada meets Inman for the first time, instead of concentrating on how they are reacting to each other, I was totally mesmerized by the detail and complexity of Nicole Kidman's eye makeup.This is a good movie, but not a great one. Somehow, I expected better from Minghella. I think he has paid his dues by now, so perhaps on his next Miramax film he will be able to tell Boss Weinstein what exactly he can do with himself.",Null,2,4,22 July 2004
"I, Robot"," Bravo, Mr. Proyas
","I, ROBOT is a vastly entertaining if not stripped to the bones version of the classic Asimov novel. Mr. Proyas is indeed an authentic auteur, with a creative eye and attention to detail that are the hallmarks of a master artist. Who can be sure if he has offered his magnum opus yet, but I certainly hope he has not! As one person put it on the message boards for this film, 'I, Robot is The Matrix'. At its essential philosophical core, that is an accurate statement. The artificial intelligence supercomputer in THE MATRIX was a logic engine as was the version in this film. The point of artificial intelligence is to enable the computer to learn on its own - just like a human baby, in a sense. The computer achieves this learning by applying a difference engine. If you are not with me so far, I suggest you check out some philosophy pages on google. It is not entirely impossible to imagine a supercomputer wanting to take over the world, simply because a difference engine showed it would be more efficient.I, ROBOT expertly modulates between ideas, action, and one really sexy shirtless scene between Smith and Moynahan.",10,4,9,31 March 2005
The Patriot," High Camp
","If one good thing came out of this production, it's that Mel Gibson met Caleb Deschanel, DP, and the two would go on to make THE PASSION OF THE Christ. But this one was strictly a paycheck effort. Columbia Pictures needed a tent-pole of the summer of 2000. Mel Gibson needed to pay off that Hamptons beach house, or put the finishing touches on his private chapel. 25 million dollars only goes so far these days.With Emmerich, you pretty much know what to expect. Something along the lines of a low-rent Bruckheimer production, but with more cheese. Emmerich is going to put Leon Rippy in all of his movies. I thought it was funny how most of the British officers are either wig-wearing fags or stiff as cardboard martinets, with the exception of Isaacs. Those eyes burn with intensity! The man could easily become an international superstar.In war, the terms 'good/evil' do not have any application. In war, especially fighting a war where you live, you kill or get killed. But a lot of the action scenes here are awfully contrived. The plot has to go from A, to B, to C, so if you want reality, watch PBS. This movie is fairly entertaining, but it's a work of fiction. Any Englishman who professes to be offended by this movie, is giving the movie far too much credit. I give the movie points for Isaacs, and for the scene when Gibson weeps with unbearable sadness when Ledger dies before his eyes.",Null,2,3,15 November 2004
Van Helsing," Brilliant re-imagining of the 30's Universal Monster Classics
","If this is what Stephen Summers can do for the old 30's and 40's Universal Monster Classic series of films, then the good Lord only knows what is in store for us with 'Flash Gordon'!This is one of the best summer movies since the first 'Mummy', also from Summers. Just like in that film, he's taken the standard mythology of an established series and introduced it to high-tech modern day film production. The integration between live-action photography and computer generated graphics is as seamless as I've ever seen, and puts 'The Hulk' to shame. Remember that they are moving the camera and establishing a path for a character that will be digitally inserted later and then you begin to appreciate the expert technical efficiency in which the film was produced. The actors chosen are all professionals and know how to do their job, Roxburgh is given special notice for his ballsy performance as a Dracula that expertly modulates between euro-trash sexy and full-blown campy. Beckinsale does her usual impersonation of a wooden plank, the role did not require much effort in my opinion. Her accent is amusing for all the wrong reasons, same as in 'From Hell' with Heather Graham. And just as Graham has no idea how bad her accent is in 'From Hell', Beckinsale is also clueless, but it adds to the charm and enjoyment of the film. Silvestri's score is among the best he has ever done and Summers should not take the mediocre and lukewarm reception that 'Van Helsing' got from audiences to heart. The film made some money in its secondary life anyway, which is where 80% of all the returns come from these days.Summers is nearly at the point of mastering his craft and I am looking forward to 'Flash Gordon'.",8,0,1,27 October 2004
Pearl Harbor," Insulting
","I do not claim to speak for WWII veterans, or survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor, but I don't have to be one of them to be insulted by this so-called epic film directed by someone who is under the impression he is Cecil B. DeMille. I have never liked any film that Ben Affleck was in, with the exception of 'Good Will Hunting' and that might have been because his screen time was cut down to minimum. His presence on the silver screen is the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard... the guy has 'I am a narcissistic jerk' written on his forehead. Josh Hartnett acquits himself very nicely, as he usually does in most of his films. I think he understands, unlike Mr. Affleck, that in movie acting, sometimes less is more. Kate Beckinsale did a good job in her impression of a wooden plank. Perhaps Jerry Bruckheimer thought any Kate would do? Beckinsale tries her best to channel Kate Winslet's bread and butter 'english rose' acting style but comes up short, way short. Don't even get me started on the films money sequence, the 45 minute long attack on Pearl Harbor. Almost 2,000 men went down on the Arizona, and countless others died on that morning. If you were going to make a film about it, why not give them some dignity, instead of a tired, sorry and clichéd love triangle story?",Null,0,1,12 September 2003
Independence Day," What can you say that has already been said?
","You know, Roland Emmerich isn't that bad with a camera. How he got hooked up with Dean Devlin, however, is beyond me. Emmerich must have needed a translator one day, and Devlin appeared on the scene, pretending to translate for Emmerich while really he negotiated a deal for himself. That must be the only logical explanation as to how anyone in Hollywood would actually give Dean Devlin money to produce a film. Anyway, on to ID4. Devlin and Emmerich approached John Viskovil, I think his name is, who is a special effects artist, the guy known primarily for blowing up the Death Star in the original STAR WARS. Well, they did some of the 'firewall' shots for Fox, and sold Fox on the idea of this movie based on those test shots. Then they typed out the most clichéd, unoriginal rip-off of George Pal's WAR OF THE WORLDS you can possibly imagine. Nothing in this movie makes any sense!1) an object 1/4 the size of the earths moon would affect the gravitational pull of the oceans, creating gigantic tidal waves.2) a spaceship that is so big as to be 1/4 the size of the earths moon would need a propulsion system so huge, it would consume so much fuel the amount of fuel needed to power the propulsion would be greater than the size of the ship itself.3) the 'firewall' ships that were 15 miles long would need enormous amounts of energy to be able to float over the surface of the earth due to the pull of the earths gravity. So where would they get the additional energy to power the 'firewall' weapon?See, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN, a little known sci-fi film directed by Robert Wise, has been there and done that. In THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN, they proposed that an alien species could be microscopic in size, yet when exposed to the right conditions (as on earth), would multiply. Also, it was made out of silicon, so it functioned as its own spaceship! Genius, if you ask me.But back to ID4: it was one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen, and the fact that it did so much business here in America and the fact MARS ATTACKS! did not, just goes to show how gullible the majority of Americans really are. Let's face it, young men have no idea why they are cheering at FIGHT CLUB showings, because they have no idea FIGHT CLUB is making fun of them.What comes around, goes around: Devlin and Emmerich got theirs when GODZILLA did God-awful business.",Null,0,1,24 October 1999
Major League," Baseball comedy classic
","'Major League' is nothing original... it borrows heavily from the 'Bad News Bears' school of screen writing. What holds the movie together is the easy charm and camaraderie of the cast, which features some tried and true character actors: Bob Uecker, basically playing himself; Margaret Whitfield, playing her patented 'bitch' role, and James Gammon, playing the wise old coot who has seen it all. Rounding out the cast are Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen and Rene Russo, who at the time was new to features. The plot is as follows: The owner of the Cleveland Indians marries a Vegas showgirl and dies on his honeymoon, leaving her the team. Cleveland (which the song being played over the main titles laughingly refers to as 'city of light, city of magic'- perhaps they are referring to when the Cuyahuga River caught on fire?) doesn't agree with her, so she wants to exploit a loophole in her contract with the city which stipulates if attendance falls below a certain level, she can take the franchise out of Cleveland. So she goes out and gets herself the sorriest looking group of ballplayers you've ever seen... A Cuban defector (because his religion is voodoo) who can only hit fastballs (Dennis Haysbert), the worlds laziest third baseman (Think Bernsen as a clean shaven Wade Boggs), a catcher with shot-out knees (Berenger channeling Johnny Bench or Cartlton Fisk), a near-sighted pitcher who throws 100 MPH at everything but the plate (Sheen), and the lead-off hitter who thinks he is Rickey Henderson (Wesley Snipes). The movie has a lot of laughs and it's a fun way to waste 90 minutes. Directed by David S. Ward of 'The Sting' fame.

This Is Spinal Tap," A brilliant satire/parody
","A true testament to the genius of this film and all the principle talents involved is the fact this came out several years before Madonna's 'Truth or Dare' concert/documentary movie.  I dare anyone to watch Madonna's movie first, then followed by 'TIST', and contradict me.  It isn't just the witty ad-libs that the cast did, since they worked with no screenplay.  It's also the throwaway bits like the cold sores that come and go on the Spinal Tap members, a blink and you miss it cameo by Billy Crystal.  Michael McKean's 'oinglish' accent just cracks me up everytime, and the 'big bottom' song is nothing short of brilliant.  The 'he choked on vomit, but it wasn't his vomit' bit is hilarious.

A Clockwork Orange," When Kubrick banned the film in England, he basically confirmed that nobody *got it*
","The idea that films are really about other films, that films 'fold' the ideas from other films into the story much like you fold bell peppers into a plain omelet to make it more interesting, is not an original one. However, it is an idea that I have stumbled across, or perhaps I knew it all along subconsciously, I just didn't have the reference to make the connection.Films are essentially about other films, but life can be about films. For example, it is well known that thugs don't feel like a thug unless they affect some kind of film clichÃ©. DePalma's 'Scarface' didn't really become popular until it was released on VHS and every gangster wanna be was buying a copy of it, and quoting the films dialogue to no end.I do get the sense here that Kubrick is trying to make the audience connect to the idea that while films do not cause people to be violent, they can influence people to become violent. The entire movie works on several layers: The gangs wear costumes, Alex's gang fights another gang on a stage, Alex picks up a couple of groupies with a 'performance' and the sex scene is shown in an exaggerated fashion (like most movie sex scenes are), the writer who gets beaten is the author of the story (the guy who wrote the book was in Ceylon, I think, when several American GI's broke into his home, beat him, and raped/murdered his wife).How do they attempt to 'cure' Alex? They show him a movie! Albeit, they force him to watch it, but they have also drugged him to associate a visceral reaction with Beethoven and the images. And this is what filmmakers do to us as well. It took my own maturity to finally comprehend some of these ideas, but in college, and looking back much to my chagrin, I watched this movie repeatedly because I thought it was a wicked black comedy. There is nothing funny about this movie, aside from a couple of winks from Kubrick. I think he is trying to put across the idea that movies can condition an audience to think/feel a certain way, and the results are not always for the best.Violence is never 'cool' despite Hollywood throwing mind-numbing amounts of violence at us every year. 'We' are Alex, in a nut-shell. We, well maybe not you and I, but vast numbers of children are being conditioned to behave a certain way, think a certain way, talk a certain way. Maybe not in the fashion of Alex, who is forced to watch with his eyelids stapled open, but how many times have you seen a child sit 3 feet from a TeeVee set, tuned out like a zombie?",10,0,2,27 October 2005
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Fascinating, repulsive, and hilarious
","This film is not for the weak of stomach or meek of heart.  If you do not appreciate european black comedy or irony, stay far, far away from this film.  Even so, there is not much humour to be found in acts of torture. The black humour is more or less directed at the Nazi's in the film.  The director does a capable job of adapting the Marquis de Sade's writings to WWII, but it looks like he did his job too well - he was shot to death, reportedly by someone who had seen this film and was so very much disturbed by it.  It does has a quasi-documentary sort of feel to it.  However, like I have stated before, this film is not a celebration of torture, and thus, should only be viewed by emotionally mature audiences who have the capacity to dissociate themselves from visceral reactions and are capable of critical thinking.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I don't get it.
","Why do we get that awesome camera 'eye' in the first 5-7 minutes of the movie, then get stuck in that old Lucas-Kurosawa mode for the rest of the movie? The answer might be... Lucas doesn't care. All he has to do is put 'Star Wars' up on the marquee and people will come running to buy tickets. It doesn't make any sense to show a story of what we already know will happen, and then not throw any technical innovations at us. The future of the movies is a camera 'eye' that moves in and out of different points of view, swooping, dancing, making use of 3 dimensions. What we get here is just a static camera, except for the first minutes that I reference at the start of the article. These prequels should be considered a scandal as to the quality of the writing, acting, and yes, the visual effects, which for the most part, do not impress. Why should anyone be surprised when the man himself is on record as saying 'Empire didn't need to be that good'.",1,5,11,2 November 2005

Cameron Crowe's films are nearly unwatchable! No, scratch that. They are unwatchable, badly acted, badly edited. A good name for it would be 'George Lucas Syndrome'- it is what happens when you start to believe your own hype and don't have any creative forces around you that challenge you, instead of mindless 'yes-men'. The only thing I liked about this movie was Jason Lee, who I could watch in any movie any day of the week, and Noah Taylor, ditto for him. In fact, these two should star in a movie together. Just find someone else to direct them.",Null,2,4,1 August 2003
Donnie Darko," complicated movie
","Great minds discuss ideas. Small minds discuss other people. And this is the reason I so love DONNIE DARKO, it's all about the ideas. Was Donnie schizo, or were these things really happening. Or more to the point, do they only happen to schizo people? My step-sister is schizo and so far all she sees are spiders in the shower, haven't seen any giant rabbits yet. I think that was the point Kelly was trying to make, that something like schizo is just a different perception of the world. Who can really say that the prophets in the Bible, if examined today, would be declared mentally ill as well? You ever notice in the Bible every time a messenger of God appears, the first thing they say is 'do not fear'! I really think when the Antichrist comes, he will use virtual reality to offer the final temptation of humanity, how else would you get through to the MTV/PS2 generation? Anyway, back to the movie. The philosophy of time travel book was just a macguffin. No such book exists, unless it's a work of fiction, just like this movie. Donnie's plight also suggests the plight of hyper-intelligent, hyper-sensitive people who see the world differently and do not easily fit into the so called 'normal' world. These people often keep to themselves, have a few, if any, friends, and are widely derided in their community as 'losers', 'misfits', 'nerds', 'geeks'. Like I said, small minds discuss other people. Great minds discuss ideas.",10,1,2,14 April 2005
