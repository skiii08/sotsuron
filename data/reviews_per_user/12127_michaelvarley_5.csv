Hereditary," Beautifully made with no coherent story line.
","Beautiful cinematography, superb acting, great slow build of tension - incoherent, silly story that leaves you feeling patronised and cheated having spent over 2 hours watching it.The ending made no sense at all and why did Gabriel Burn burn when the book did? Why did the sister get taken to a grown up party? Why did she even die? Did the grandmother possess the daughter, the mother or no one? And how was she related to the demon? Who are all the ghostly figures and why did they look like photoshopped lithographs?All the lose ends don't create mystery, they show a complete failure of story writing.",4,1,4,1 September 2018
Knives Out," Brilliant Film
",Stumbled across this film by accident which tells you an awful lot about the film industry.Much better than any other film of 2019 as far as I remember.Watch it.,9,1,3,3 June 2020
Da 5 Bloods," Great Film
","I think a lot of people just don't get this film or BLM.It's a very clever film, more allegorical in a sense than something with a clear, logical plot.The way the gold makes them behave, as human beings and as black guys, matters not the logistics of the gold being there or their ages compared to how they look in flash backs etc.It's a film about solidarity and the corrosive effect of capitalism/ white privilege/ American imperialism.It's a bit too intellectual for film critics.",10,4,16,15 June 2020
Annihilation," Watch it on Netflix
",Entertaining and kind of interesting and intelligent.Worth watching if you have time.,7,0,1,1 September 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Stunning visually but lacks story.
","This film has an 8.5 currently which it in no way deserves considering the lack of any kind of original or interesting storyline.Yes there is loads of action, it is beautifully shot and everything you could want from a post apocalyptic, desert survivor scenario as far as they way it looks. I'm sure it cost a load of money.But what was great about the original, low budget films was the angst of Max torn between the good and evil within himself; Hardy is a great actor but we don't see much of his talent and what we do see is too sketchy to really get a feel for his character. Theron is great too but once again there is really not much going on. The other guy is quite good and the rest mediocre at best - with such stock, stereotypical characters they did not have much to work with.So, if you would like to see a two hour car crash set in an apocalyptic, spaghetti western future without the cowboys this if the film for you; if you want something to think about, don't bother.",7,5,10,3 July 2015
