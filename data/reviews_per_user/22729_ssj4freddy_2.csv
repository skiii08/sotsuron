The Benchwarmers," Wow. . .is this what over 100 years of films has given us?
","I only have 1000 words to describe how absolutely terrible this movie is? Well, why don't I sum it up in a couple of words? Boom mic in every shot, toilet humor in every scene, story coherency thrown out the window, acting that makes soft-core porno look like Oscar worthy acting, and John Heder. This movie gives comedies a bad name, and doesn't even deserve to be called a film. Please do yourself a favor, instead of wasting $10 on this filth, drink a glass of antifreeze--it will leave you with a better feeling. This movie should be at the bottom of the bucket, and if it doesn't get there, IMDb members should really look at themselves in pity.",1,12,25,8 April 2006
No Country for Old Men," Probably the best piece of cinema ever
","No Country for Old Men is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. My reasons are as follows: Great script with natural dialect, beautiful cinematography, masterful direction by the Coen bros, and some of the best performances I've seen (Javier as Chigurh is the epitome of bestial psychosis). The movie is a movie lovers film; if you are a casual fan, it probably won't tickle your fancy. And this is definitely a movie you watch time and time again to catch all the little details the Coen bros put into it. Please, see this with an open mind because if you go in looking for a balls out action movie, you'll be sadly disappointed even though the action is good.",10,0,8,10 December 2007
