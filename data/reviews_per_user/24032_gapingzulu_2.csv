Skyfall," Terrible movie
","An insult to James Bond film. Hollywood just ripped of all the people who paid to watch the movie like myself. This is just crap. Very little action. Boring first half, waited for some action...disappointing terrible other half. The only people who probably liked this film are kids who haven't seen enough James Bond film.Watch older James Bond film and it will be worth it but Daniel Craig is 44 years old and has the energy of 65 year old.The villain is lame.Waste of my time and money.I had high expectations because of good reviews on internet and Skyfall earning lots of moolah at the box office but after few months even the story if forgettable and please take that old lady out because she is too old.",3,6,15,28 January 2013
Jack Reacher," One Shot
","This movie should have been called 'One Shot' because it is a better title. It was a good movie but wait for DVD and not for theatre. Tom Cruise, where is the action? The movie had good plot from what I can remember. However, I feel there was very little action.I saw this movie first day it was released and surprised when I told someone I watched this movie and they had not even heard of the name of the movie.They should make more movies about novel 'cause it makes a movie more interesting but not all movies turn out to be as good as this one.Wish there was more from leading lady in the movie but alas, there wasn't much in it.I give it 6 out of 10.Definitely watch it for some interesting story.",6,1,6,28 January 2013
