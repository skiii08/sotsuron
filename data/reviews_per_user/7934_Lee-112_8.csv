Vertigo," good movie
","I will always love this movie, as being one of my favorite Hitchcock films. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts best performances, Kim Novak is great too.This film is filled with mystery, suspense, and good acting.  I never get tired of watching this film.  This is one of the very few movies that i've seen that lets you get to know the characters really good and feel what they're feeling.  That's probably one of the main reasons why I liked this movie so much.All in all, it's a great film and if you haven't seen it, then go rent it.",Null,0,0,11 August 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Good movie that I enjoyed watching
","I didn't get a chance to see this film on the big screen, but I rented it when it first came out on video.  I'm very glad that this film won Best Picture, because it was a terrific film.  But what I now don't agree on was that I don't think Gwyneth Paltrow should have won Best Actress, Cate Blanchett should have won, she was excellent.  I'm not saying Paltrow wasn't, because she was very good, as was Joseph Fiennes. 
Judi Dench was wonderful on her small screen time, and also was Rush and Affleck.This was a very good story that I enjoyed watching, so if you haven't yet seen this, rent it on video.",Null,0,1,14 August 1999
Fargo," One of the best movies of the year...
","Fargo is one of the best movies of the 90's... It has a terrific cast, with wonderful performances.  Frances McDormand won Best Actress, and it was well-deserved.  This is one of those movies I don't get sick of after watching it a couple of times, this movie was so funny.If you haven't yet seen Fargo, then you should go out and rent it tonight. You wont regret it, this is a great movie.  I gave this movie a deserving 10.",10,0,1,23 October 1999
Carrie," Never gets old
","I love this movie so much.  This is one of the few movies i've seen that never gets old.  Great performances by all the cast.  Especially by Piper Laurie, and Sissy Spacek.  Betty Buckley is wonderful as always, and it's funny to see a young John Travolta in the mix.Even though this film isn't scary, it's actually kind of sad, it still remains to be one of my favorite horror films.  If you haven't seen this, then you should go out and rent it.  It's a great film, with great actors, and one of the few movies that measure up to the books by Stephen King.",8,0,0,19 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," Good Movie
","Though it wasn't as scary and thrilling as it was hyped up to be, this was a good movie.  It delivers some thrills and edge of the seat moments (the ending of course).  If you like mysterious dramas with twist endings, then you would love this film, otherwise than that, you might think it's a little dull. This movie has a very good story to it, but I think it could have been better.  But i DO recommend you to go see it, I thought it was pretty good.",7,0,0,6 August 1999
Rear Window," One of my favorite films
","This has always been one of my favorite films, it has very fine performances by James Stewart and Grace Kelly.  Rear Window delivers mystery and suspense, and will never lose its touch.This has to be one of my favorite Hitchcock films, I love watching it each time I watch it.  If you haven't yet seen this film, then you should because it's really good and one of the finest films i've seen.",10,0,2,15 August 1999
Born on the Fourth of July," One of Stone's best pictures
","Tom Cruise was terrific in this film.  Born on the Fourth of July was a pretty good movie, and very moving.  Terrific performances by all the cast. Of course, especially by Cruise.This must be one of Oliver Stone's best pictures.  I enjoyed watching this film, and I will enjoy it even more the next time I watch it.  If you haven't yet to see this film, you should go rent it because it's a very good film with good performances.",8,1,3,17 August 1999
The Birds," never gets old
","This movie never gets old, i've always liked this movie for some odd reason. I watched this the other night and I enjoyed it as I did when I first saw it.  It's definitely not Hitchcock's best, but it's just a nice entertaining movie.  Some parts tend to drag on, but then the birds would come.  It's a good story, a little odd but good.  Tippi Hedren is always nice to watch, and Jessica Tandy also.  If you and a couple of friends are going to have a blockbuster night, I suggest this film.",Null,0,0,12 August 1999
