Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Is it over yet?
","One of the worst movies ever made.  I admit that it's visually stunning, but that's not enough to sustain a film.  It's like watching a mural dry. This is the first movie during which I actually glanced at my watch.  Cardboard characters, pointless action sequences, and droll music.Down there with The Power Rangers Movie, Pokemon: The Movie, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, etc.",1,3,6,23 May 2000
Hero," Sweepingly Majestic Portrayal of Mythic Characters
","This is an amazing film that delves into ancient myths and legends.  The broad colors fit well with the broad mythic symbolisms of the tale and characters, like the brush-strokes of Michelangelo or Rembrant.  This film is full of archetypes, as it should be since it is a cinematic update of old oral myths and legends, so don't expect too much commercial pop-fare.  One can only hope other legends, such as Hercules or King Arthur, can be filmed with such depth and artistry.  The only western film that comes close is Boorman's Excalibur.  Absolutely spectacular!And for those simpletons who can't wrap their heads around mythic martial artists -- you're just being bigoted and xenophobic.  How can you comfortably accept the impossible feats of Hercules or Thor or Apollo without accepting impossible feats of Nameless or Broken Sword?  They all occupy the same realm of fantasy and myth, and must be treated as such.",Null,0,0,23 June 2003
