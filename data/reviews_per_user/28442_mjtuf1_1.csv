Moneyball," Entertaining
","I enjoyed this movie, mainly due to the fact that the 2002 Oakland a's were from my generation when I was a teenage baseball fan. the movie was entertaining because I can see the story of how a baseball team and different players of that time were built. I enjoyed thinking back to myself remember that player or remember this game or that game? Although the movie is based on a true story, a lot of it is fictionalized. Brad Pitt turned the character of Billy Beene into a smooth overconfident guy that he was not in real life.I enjoyed the movie because of the time line of it, and overall it was a good baseball movie. However i don't understand the point of making this movie. MoneyBall is about a good baseball team that over-achieved and had a good season but went no where after. The billy Beane Oakland a's never won anything, so I don't even understand the point of making this movie. I think a movie about the 2002 angels who unexpectedly won the world series would have made for a better story.Money ball is a watchable entertaining baseball movie, that appealed even more to me due to the time it's story took place. But in reality its just a glorified story of a team that had a good season but went no further.",7,0,0,23 December 2011
