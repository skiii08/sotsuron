The Lobster," Worst movie I've ever seen.
","What was advertised as a dark comedy was just dark, boring, and VERY difficult to endure. I struggled through the whole movie, expecting it to finally 'take off' which never happened. Considering Colin Farrell starred in it, I expected a decent movie, but was I ever mistaken! When it ended, I was relieved, but angry because I had wasted all that time when I could have been watching something worthwhile. It was so convoluted, it was hard to follow. Most of it made no sense at all. This was so disappointing and frustrating. It is definitely the WORST movie I've ever watched. I wish there had been a minus rating. I would have given it a minus 10.",1,10,15,12 June 2016
