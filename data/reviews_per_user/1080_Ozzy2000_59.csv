"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," PLeasant British comedy
",A pleasant little comedy set in London about a man who does a runner on his pregnant bride on their wedding day. Five years later he ends up a fat slob working as a security guard in a womens clothing store.He has access to his son and desperately wants to get with his wife but unfortunately she has chosen an upwardly mobile American with money to marry. Both this slob and the American enter a marathon which becomes a race for which the winner will win the women.Its a really stupid story with a real struggle to get a laugh from the audience I was with. I want bother covering this film much more as it was a failure as a comedy with only a few cheap laughs and very contrived cliché feel good scenes.,6,1,3,5 July 2008
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Great Adventure movie
","As with the first film by John Turteltaub the Gates family headed by Ben Gates played by the hairpiece clad Nicolas cage pursue the families tradition of code cracking of secret societies set up by the founding fathers of the American Constitution. By cracking these codes once again as with the first film the great historical and mythological lost treasures from around the world are hidden by the first American presidents somewhere amongst its national and historical monuments. During the pursuit of these treasures the FBI's special secret society of Freemasonry squad monitor Ben Cages activities. Ben Cage gets involved in a sequence of highly improbable and implausible events along with the vivacious blond Abigail Chase , played by Diane Kruger, who again compromises her position in Government in exchange for priceless antiques from Ben Cage. Riley Poole plays Ben Cages side kick in this latest pursuit with Mitch Wilkinson, played Ed Harris, assuming the rival treasure hunter with traditional family claims to code cracking but with a lust for the booty. As with the first film the sets are flimsy and solid wooden beams appear to have rotted over a couple of hundred years which would be highly unlikely especially if they were built around national treasures. The notion of secret societies and secret president business is very superficially explored and given a token academic mention. For experienced movie fans you will see a plagiarized scene from Gregory Pecks 'A Roman Holiday' where he places his hand in a stone monument.As with that silly film the 'Da Vinci Code' Ben Cage stumbles on the crack of each code just in time. One wonders how these treasures were hidden so secretly when it must of taken hundreds to move them. As with the first film and very predictably the treasure is found but it doesn't appear to g;litter that much. Cage and his party end up with healthy commissions. A very entertaining film although not up to the first one. Worth seeing.",8,0,2,7 July 2008
The Incredible Hulk," Bulk Hulk
","Strangely enough Marvel has produced another film version of the Marvel Comic book hero, the Hulk. It is difficult to compare the two they are both really good but the first one had arguably better CGI but the second had a more likable hulk. Of course all hulks need anger management and heaps of Valium rather than natural meditative techniques as we learn from the second version. Liv Tyler plays the romantic interest of Hulk played by Edward Norton. Liv attempts to play a demure delicate woman but instead appears very large, Amazonian and broad shouldered that makes the human hulk look really weak and effeminate maybe this was deliberate. The big showdown at the end of the film between the Hulk and the cheaper generic hulk imitation is very funny and enjoyable like world championship wrestling. There is also a cameo appearance of Mr Stark of Iron man played by Robert Downey Jnr. which implies very directly that the Hulk may join forces with Iron Man to defeat some crazy evil force in a sequel. I did note that the Hulk inducing chemicals were not destroyed so that may be the key to why there will be a follow up. I think the important thing in the next Hulk movie will be revolutionary stretch pants for the Hulk or maybe an ultra stretch leotard. I also think that an ultra stretch condom might also help a wee bit, the mind boggles.Anyway burnt out Baby boomers who saw the sixties TV version and much younger males really love these action movies and are forgiving with all the technical errors. Catch it while its on the big screen where the special effects are best seen.",9,3,5,17 June 2008
I'm Not There," Dylan fans would be disgusted
",Martin Scorsese's documentary on Bob Dylan 'No direction Home' was a fantastic reflection on the early part of Dylan's life.This film is full of crappy interpretations of a famous Icon who is still alive. I am surprised that Dylan let this go ahead but the money must have been good enough.This film will not enhance any one's appreciation of the man or his music. Its a trendy arty farty way of exploiting a famous icon with some really crappy acting. Extremely bad taste in casting especially Cate Blanchett who looks far too masculine and heavy jawed to play the young Dylan. Blanchett's interpretation and accent are shockingly bad.,1,11,18,30 January 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," My wifes comments
",Actor Jason Segel managed to get this funny little comedy he had written made by producer Sam Apatow and I am glad he did. Jason plays Peter Pretter a film sound score musician who gets dumped by his popular and beautiful Blonde TV drama soapie girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kristin Bell). He is totally devastated and tries to cope by going out with his brother and having indiscriminate sex with a few women but still feels in love and attached with Sarah. He eventually decides to get away and go on vacation to Hawai and by total chance books into the same resort as Sarah and her new Boyfriend happen to be holidaying. The accidental discovery occurs at the resort reception and Peter is devastated to see Sarah with her new British Pop Star boyfriend Aldous Snow. The very beautiful resort receptionist Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis) witnesses the unfortunate encounter and her heart immediately goes out to Peter and she books him into the resorts top suite for free and gets the resort staff to treat him really well.The friendship between Peter and Rachel develops and he begins to discover that his depression and 'Holding of the Torch' for Sarah is not really worthwhile. He also begins to discover who Sarah Marshall really is and so does Aldous.There are many funny scenes about couples discovering their sexuality and every almost every character has their redeeming features. There are lots of male full frontal scenes which is a delightful change for us females. I think the film is a really well balanced film about the breaking up and the formation of relationships. I was a bit concerned about the fact that Sarah had been cheating on Peter with Aldous for sometime before she confessed to Peter as Aldous confesses he had genital herpes in one scene and I hope he was just joking for all concerned.Me and the girls really enjoyed this little film and if that was Jason Segal's real bit then WOOF!!!!!!!!!,10,5,16,29 April 2008
12 Monkeys," A great film Classic
",Without doubt one of Terry Gilliam's own favorite films he has directed and also quoted by Bruce Willis as his finest work his proud of. Brad Pitt also praises the film as one of his best performances. Inspired by the 1962 French film written and directed by Chris Marker this English adaptation was written by David Webb Peoples after producer Robert Kosberg raised the finance for the film. An astonishing story about a virus that is let loose by a Biologist Dr Peters (David Morse of Contact) at a Biological chemical research firm run by Dr Goines (Christopher Plummer). The virus virtually wipes out the Human race of five billion people but the animal kingdom is immune. A group of advanced scientists survive in a high tech underground city into the future and harness time travel and send back human prisoners to before the disaster to discover how the disaster occurred. The prisoners gain pardons for their very stressful time travel and one of the best is James Cole played by Bruce Willis. After several journeys back in time Cole discovers that the Animal Liberation group The 12 Monkeys headed by Jeffrey Goines ( Brad Pitt) son of Dr Goines is some how connected. Also on theses time travel episodes he repeatedly meets Psychiatrist Dr Railly (Madelaine Stowe)who eventually realizes that she has been repeatedly meeting Cole and that the time travel and his story of the plight of the human race is real. This film contains a brilliant interweaving plot structure that skillfully deals with the anomalies of time travel science fiction as well as a plausible man made scenario for the disastrous extinction of the human species.an extraordinary masterpiece of a Film has become recognised as one of the great classics of film making. It is already a cult classic amongst the a List actors and directors. Terry Gilliam extracts brilliant performances from all the actors and the whole spectrum of emotion including the romance and moment of belief of Dr Railly for Cole.,10,1,2,13 March 2008
The Other Boleyn Girl," A very poor film
","The acting in this film was very poor to the point that it was boring. Eric Bana's portrayal of King Henry was totally inappropriate as his accent, his language and delivery was too heavy toned and desperate for the period and for some one of regal status at this point of history. It is the use of dramatic license that is used to imbue some sort of passion in what was a very dry and stoic King Henry the eighth. There are many British actors who were far more appropriate for the role than an Australian 'Actor'. The recent production 'The Tudors' proves my point extremely well. Another silly film that is historically non factual.",1,5,10,10 March 2008
Terminator Salvation," Boring Monotone emotionless and a failure
",Another extremely wealthy Australian with cosmetic surgery gives another film the kiss of death. Anyone who cannot see that this Worthington maintained one stone faced emotionless non-animated expressionless face throughout the film is blind. The man spoke in a monotone as well that is one tone without any phrasing. The film was full of meaningless and nonsensical scenes such as the Asian Filipino totally out of character Female pilot developing a relationship with stone faced turd on absolutely no basis whatsoever not even a hint of subtext to justify it . The cruelty to the little Afro boy by Worthington's expressionless character also has no basis as he suddenly has to prove his worthiness as a resistance fighter before his Sky-net status is revealed. The first half of the film is like a stylistic mad max meets transformer.The appearance of Arnie at the local Sky-net headquarters even fails to prevent this film sinking into a mindless sycophantic film suited your usual Blind Aussie actor fans and tasteless morons. It is not even worth adding to my terminator trilogy of my library as it betrays the theme and brand of the film. Also I find it absolutely hysterically goofy that Christian bales character did not bring the so called special energy pulsar with him that is supposed to act as an off switch to the Sky-net controlled militia at its headquarters. The film is stupid and suited for Bu t-fu ckers that will no doubt flame me for my criticism. Christian bales delvers the only credible acting performance but is not required to do that much and Worthington will no doubt buy more roles in films on a royalty exchange deal. Why can't people see that it would be impossible for an unknown actor to land a role in a major budget film like this with no real and credible acting portfolio.,1,15,26,4 June 2009

Juno," Trailer Trash teen pregnancy film
",John Malkovich has produced this screenplay by Diablo Cody with Jason Reitman directing (his previous work writing and directing 'Thanking for smoking' In real life Ellen Page is a rich kid who comes across as a real smart alec and arrogant type and she manages to transfer that character into her previous role in 'Hard Candy' and this role.This supposedly hip chick foolishly get her self pregnant with a high school jock Paulie Bleeker (played by Michael Cera) and then goes about dealing with the problem.Her very hip and sympathetic parents support her decision to adopt the baby out and the whole thing is of course really divorced from realty.No doubt trailer park trash across the world will celebrate this silly story of teen pregnancy. There is a hint of anti 'pro-choices' and 'right to lifer' underlying this film.It ends up a very silly and schmaltzy movie about teen pregnancy that has already sucked in huge box office results as you would expect in these days of really trashy films.,10,131,223,22 January 2008
Cloverfield," A double jointed Godzilla with a camel head
","This shockingly stupid horror cum science fiction movie begins from the point of view of a classified video tape found in Central park. The film begins with the video taping of a young couples day out that is over recording during a party in which the same couple confront problems in there relationship. As the party and the relationship saga drag on there is an almighty explosion in the centre of town that of course is mid Manhattan. From there the couple and there friends are caught up in mayhem that ensues as the USA military engage this giant double jointed beast with the face of a camel and bubblegum balloon ears and a large dinosaur tale. The couples become separated but join up again. In the mean time, the Big Monster is tearing down the city and spewing a little creatures probably its offspring that look like nasty one-meter high frenetic crabs. These crabs appear easy to kill but the fully-grown one is proving to be a match for the US military.The whole film is shot in hand held cinema Veritas style like a real home video account to give more realism. Unfortunately, an hour half of this shooting style is very jerky and will take you close to having a headache. It is very tedious but does have that highly dramatic effect. Some one mentioned that there was a similarity with Blair Witch project but they obviously meant the jerky cinematographic shooting style as there is no other similarity.The camel headed monster had a similar body of those creatures in 'Pitch Black' but a hundred times bigger.A very silly film in which the hand held camera stuff was really over done even though some of the CGI scenes were stunning.Worth a watch but do not forget your favorite headache remedy pills.",1,24,48,17 January 2008
Crash," Brilliant must see film
",This will Oscar winning Indi film is set to become a classic with great performances from all of the main actors. The film deals with the differing and evolving values of African Americans in a way never seen before in Film. It also deals with racism and corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department. The film exhibits an interweaving plot structure that is masterfully shot and edited on a small budget. Film making at its finest. The story amongst its many intricacies and character transformational arcs in particular Matt Dillons character there is also a strange twist with an African Black Criminal who gets saved by one of his 'Brother' then strangely ends up liberating a group of illegal immigrant 'slaves'. Also the almost tragic confrontation between the Mayors wife and a hardworking family Latino man and also another run in with newly arrived middle eastern family. The clash of cultures is the real true life paradigm of American culture '....giving me you poor and unwashed...' or to that effect. This film clearly demonstrates why the Americans lead the world in groundbreaking film techniques as well as those that tastefully reveal the human condition. The blocking of scenes and the emotive delivery of each scene keeps you spellbound throughout the film. This film would easily be amongst the best I have seen in the few years and all its actors deserved Oscars infinitely more than any actors in the last decade. This film is actually worth buying on DVD and I hope this style of film inspires more great auteurs to surface as the current spate of trashy films is slowly killing the industry. I strongly recommend all to see this film and it should be shown in schools and be studied.,10,1,6,5 July 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Brilliant Masterpiece in Cinema
","One of the great timeless classic Black comedies by the without doubt the greatest Film Auteur ever the one and only Stanley Kubrick. Shot with specially hand grounded film lenses in Black and white is shot with exquisite cinema-graphic effect and masterful blocking of scenes and editing characteristic of direct and cinematographer Kubrick is set in the early sixties, when the film is actually made, and contains state of the art military technology of the age of the classic cold war between Russia and the United States of America.A general Jack D. Ripper, the late Sterling Hayden, in charge of an American Military Air base which controls the tactical strategic nuclear armed bomber air squadron invokes a special clause in the USA strategic defense policy which sets off a pre-emptive nuclear strike against Russia.Peter Sellers plays several very memorable in not now famous roles in the film one as the president of the USA, Merkin Muffley, who desperately tries to recall the attack with the assistance of the Russian president from the safety of the USA war room. Sellers also plays a British Officer, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, at the military air force base who tries desperately to contact the President with the recall code needed to prevent the attack caused by his Commanding General Ripper. Sellers also plays an ex Nazi Scientist, Dr StrangeLove advises USA president of how the human races will endure and survive a nuclear holocaust.This film is outrageously hilarious and at the same time a completely serious study of the inherit problems of a fail-safe Nuclear arsenal in those troubling times of the Cold war arms race. A very memorable film for those who grew up in the shadow of the Nuclear Mushroom cloud and still relevant to the current generation. Like most of Kubrick's films its worth seeing repeatedly and if you don't get a little chuckle from it or even intellectual stimulation then I suggest you stick to Australian films. Truly Great Cinema.",10,3,6,7 July 2008
Knocked Up," Family Comedy worth seeing
",A very funny family comedy about a desperate single young women Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) goes out with her girlfriend one night to a bar for some fun. Alison meets fun loving single bum Ben Stone (Seth Rogan). The night and encounter flow in an unexpected and unlikely direction for two people who appear to be very superficially acquainted with each other and they end up in bed together. Due to a misunderstanding during the sex Ben inadvertently does not use protection as intended. As a result after a few weeks Alison learns she is pregnant pregnant and manages to locate Ben. Katherine and Ben attempt to come to terms with the situation and discover different sides to themselves as the situation unravels itself. Although Romantic comedies are a wee bit predictable they are still very funny and entertaining. A film which pushes the envelope a wee bit regarding childbirth but is worth seeing on DVD,9,0,2,5 July 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," For Depp fans
","This film based on Stephen Sondheim's musical was inspired by music by the great Bernard Hermann has taken fifteen years to get made. Johnny Depp plays Benjamin Barker who gets arrested, wrongly convicted and deported to Australia after a Judge Turpin played by Alan Rickman decides he wants his wife and their baby. Eventually Barker returns to England as a dark and macabre character with a new name Sweeney Todd and is intent on revenge on the Judge for taking away his happy family life and business as a barber. Sweeney Todd returns to his old business and meets the shop owner Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who tells him that his wife took poison to kill herself and that his baby daughter has grown up and is in the care of Judge Turpin who now has decided he wants the child to be his woman. Sweeny becomes a new barber and kills his customer in this insane killing spree whilst Mrs Lovett makes meat pies from the human carcases. The flows like cheap plonk and spurts here and there. Eventually Sweeney kills Mrs Lovett for lying about his wife's death and then inadvertently kills his wife but not for getting revenge on the Judge. This contemporary slasher version of 'Rocky Horror' show did deserve an Oscar for art direction as it depicts the true grit of 19th century London. Its a very simple and gory film with predictable outbreaks of forgettable musical genre songs however those females obsessed with Johnny Depp's looks will declare this a masterpiece due to their misguided and childish adulation. In fact in most cases Depp is a very ordinary but highly entertaining actor who chooses weird character roles where overacting and over animation are expected. I have enjoyed much of Burton's works immensely especially 'Mar's Attacks' and forgive him for this fairly mediocre film. Both Burton and Depp can afford to make movies of this type at this stage of their careers as they know they have a captive audience. Retro Goths will also enjoy it.",2,4,11,26 February 2008
Nacho Libre," Jack Black at his best
","Ignacio as a child is an obese orphan growing up in a very poor Mexican religious orphanage. To cope with the deprivation the young Ignacio fantasies he a great wrestler or in Mexico a Luchador. He even makes up a wrestler's out fit and calls himself 'Nacho Libre' but he is punished and forbidden to live out his fantasy. Ignacio grows up ( played by Jack Black) and becomes a friar who cooks meals for the children in the orphanage. He loves the children and has a big heart but feels terrible about having to feed them meals cooked with rotting vegetables and spiced up with nacho crackers donated by the town cafe. A nun, Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) joins the orphanage and Ignacio is smitten by her and she also is endeared to his devotion to the children. Ignacio goes into town to collect the Nachos when he confronts this deprived beggar Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez)who is stealing the Nachos and a fight ensues. Esqueleto puts up a strong fight but Ignasio overpowers him and decides to befriend him. Esqueleto has inspired Ignacio to secretly enter the local wrestling scene in order to to gain the skills of the Champion wrestler Ramses. He does this so he can win money to help the orphans. Ignacio and Esqueleto get beaten in the wring by everyone but are popular and earn money. Ingansio is found out by the the other friars who banish him from the orphanage. In desperation Ingnasio is inspired by Esqueleto to enter a competition to win a fortune by beating the great Ramses. To add to the motivation he hopes win favour with Sister Encarnacion who finds his forbidden mission has a noble objective. Jack Black's animated self effacing performances and range of silly facial expressions give the character real dimension. An extremely funny film with a very unusual story. It will live on as a classic and is worth the purchase of the DVD.",10,1,3,7 March 2008
Full Metal Jacket," Great Vietnam war classic
","Now that we can make much more detailed and informed reflections of the regrettable and controversial American involvement in the Vietnam war. The conspiracy theories now wear thin and the Communist regime has brought economic misery but stability to contemporary Vietnam. This film opens with the brutality involved in training marines for this war from the view of Private Joker (Mathew Modine) especially on the unfortunate obese Pvt Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) whose countenance has what appears to be a permanent grin. Pvt Pyle suffers a total breakdown and shoots his training Sergeant. These events brought focus on the brutal and dehumanising training on young unfortunate men who were drafted rather than enlisting.The second part of the film takes us to the streets of war torn Vietnam where the brutality of of some American soldiers is highlighted first on a tiny Vietnamese prostitute and then a tiny Female Viet Cong sniper who is finally gunned down after cutting down some troops. The plight of Vietnamese women is highlighted in these two scenes.There have been many clichés made about contemporary war films and its now stupid and boring to get caught up in these eloquent phrases about the duality of man and futility of war. Historical perspectives of war are usually made with a political stance in mind and this film tends to reinforce the darker aspects of this tragic conflict.This film does not glorify American soldiers and their courage as does World war 2 films but examines the moral dilemma's involved in serving your country.Kubrick's masterful production values make this a very confronting film and has left America with an important reminder that foreign military intervention is thwart with moral danger.Truly one of the great Vietnam war films along with 'Deer Hunter', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon', 'Heaven and Earth', 'Escape Dawn' and 'Born on the 4th July'.A great example if the film mastery of the greatest of them all STANLEY KUBRICK.",10,0,3,26 May 2008
"Monsters, Inc."," Excellent children's film really cute
","This wonderful Walt Disney animation is a story about the strange world of monsters that usually invade the dreams of children and their world is energised by their screams of fear. One of the more successful monsters fails to scare a certain very cute child because he actually looks very cute and lovable himself. The child enraptured by him chases him into his world. This monster Sully and his mate Boo decide they love children and that there world needs to find an alternative energy source.A very beautiful and enchanting film for the young and young at heart. My mom, who was a close friend of Late Ava Gardner and Gregory Peck, loved the film and thought it was very suitable for her grand children and so I do I. As my extended family in the USA are major share holders at Walt Disney I might be accused of bias but this is not the case it is simply a very good film to show children as it will help them deal with scary nightmares.",10,0,1,5 July 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Most overrated films in Cinema history
","It is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium.These three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible. For example Peter Jackson knew that he could New Zealand Citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown New Zealand Countryside.Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost. This was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did. How the motion Picture Academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious.The cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques. This has been supported many Cinematographers in many blogs.The acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from Australians and New Zealanders due to Peter Jackson's view that they are better actors than Americans and the British. In fact Australians and New Zealanders have this strange dislike Americans despite consuming their films.The animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in 'dusk till dawn' it makes you wonder if the CGI people had much imagination. The many gratuitously violent scenes, not described as such in the books, would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the Golum. In fact most of the CGI was carried out by Americans hired by Peter Jacksons multi-million dollar CGI suite.Which at the end of the day makes you wonder where Mr Peter Jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi-million dollar film effects studio in New Zealand.The whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with Peter Jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the project.It is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination.It was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement. I fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldn't go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in CGI. I am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like John Boorman who was originally going to make the film.I am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and Peter Jackson.",1,2,11,29 June 2007
The Thing," Classic Sci-Fi
","As Children both Director John Carpenter and co-producer Stuart Cohen saw the 1952 production of 'The Thing from another world' directed by Howard Hawks, which was based on the 1938 novel 'Who goes there'. In 1976 Stuart Cohen decided to remake the film. It is believed that it inspired the making of the 1956 and 1978 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers ' and 1979 'The Alien' as well as the 1981 'The thing' . Since that time a whole plethora of Science Fiction horror films have been spawned using the same theme. Al;though initially a box office failure it became a cult classic and subsequently evergreen profit maker.Since many great reviews have already be made of this classic film I merely endorsing all reviews and fans of this great classic Science fiction film.The film begins with a Helicopter chase of a lone dog in the Arctic winter near a scientific research station 'No 31'. The crew at '31' witness the crash of the Helicopter and adopt the dog. They investigate and find a strangely mutilated body and another base nearby.Gradually the '31' crew lead by R' J. McReady played by Kurt Russel discover the dog is infected with some strange alien virus that attacks its host and then transforms itself into a copy of the victim. This film effects were almost unique for the time as there was no CGI both Albert Whitlock with special photography effects Rob Bottin ( The Howling) creates the make up a plausible and terrifying Alien creature. Even the the alien form is revealed early on the suspense of the film is maintained as the '31' crew become confused as to is infected amongst them.I strongly recommend this classic sci fi horror flick to all fans of the genre.",8,0,1,6 July 2008
21," Unreal but entertaining.
","Having been to Las Vegas and also loving table games I found the film entertaining and mildly nostalgic even though my trip was only a couple of years ago.The film is very loosely based on a bunch of MIT students who used card counting rather laboriously to win around $60,000 each with a couple of exceptions over a long period in various Casinos around the USA. They were eventually banned from casinos and could have legally challenged the casinos for their rights to play there but instead pursued their studies and careers.The film however takes us on a silly fantasy tour in which the players win extraordinary amounts and being caught means a violent exit from the casinos. The film is not only unrealistic but totally misleading. It was up to about a decade ago that some casinos used a three deck shoe for Black Jack but now as with Australia there are five deck shoes which makes card counting almost impossible as well as automatic shufflers which totally make it card counting useless.Kevin Spacey again performs well as the lecturer who runs the team of recruited card counters. The idea that you have to be some sort of genius or A grade grad student is a fallacy you just need to highly motivated well trained and have a reasonable memory and several months experience at Black Jack.The other ridiculous aspect of the film is that if you wanted to play really big and win big in a few sessions at any of the major casinos you could go to the high roller or premium rooms. Another strange thing about the film is that they are supposed to be playing at various casinos and the Casino Investigator who is tracking them Cole Williams ( Laurence Fishburne) appears to work at all the casinos at the same time which is really silly.I guess most people not only miss my observations but wouldn't really care and just enjoy the action and bright lights of Vegas and above all the fantasy.So for fantasy and entertainment I give the film three stars.",9,0,2,18 May 2008
The Shining," A great Classic Horror Film
","Another of the great classic films and screenplays by Stanley Kubrick which he based on the novel by Stephen King. This film was considered one of the best horror films at the time it was made and also is really the film that launched Stephen King's writing and film career in earnest, he was even the stills photographer on the crew. This film also highlighted Jack Nicholsons career and he plays recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance who brings his wife Wendy (Shelley Duval) and son Danny ( Danny Lloyd) to the 'Over Look' Summer Resort as a live in caretaker for the winter period when it is closed down. On arrival they are greeted the Head Chef Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) who immediately establishes that Danny is a spiritual psychic and that his grandmother called this ability the Shining. Left alone the family set out to endure the isolated winter at the hotel with Jack also able one to use his spare time to pursue his career as a writer. one-dimensional Eventually Jacks behaviour gradually becomes manic and severely crazed after various episodes and lapses into various demented states. These episodes are triggered by real and/or imagined encounters with staff and patrons from several decades in the past various tragic occurrences at the Hotel. Danny is also able to tap into evidence of the past tragedies with his 'Shining' abilities. As Jack turns on his own family his countenance becomes what is now considered one of the classic crazed facial expressions of cinema history. From this point Wendy and Danny have to contend with Jack and fight for their lives. Kubrick's production values and graphic horror scenes add a unique ambiance to the film. Kubrick's unique cinematographer, directing and editing abilities combined with his meticulous hands on approach to film making make this film suspenseful and intriguing at every turn. It is one of the great horror classics of all time without the today's one dimensional gratuitous use of body mutilation",10,1,3,25 March 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," great satire of the 'Walk the line' film
","I have just seen a really great comedy in which the whole cinema was belly laughing. This obvious satire of 'Walk the Line' and themes of sex drugs and rock and roll stories in general is extremely funny and raunchy. This is the Dewey Cox story who is played by John C. Reilly. Reilly's performance gave me flashbacks of his role in Boogie Nights as an aspiring 80's Rock Star but this was a rich leading role.I think its helpful to see 'walk the line' but not altogether necessary as the 'rags to riches' cliché rock star story has been put together very thoughtfully. I do not want to spoil this film with a detailed synopsis. There heaps of graphic drug and sex scenes so be warned. Dewy Cox befriends 'The Beatles' , Elvis and very Music Icons along the way to the top. The Jewish humour incorporated into this film is great and there are guest appearances by Jack Black, Jason Schwartzman, Jewel, Lyle Lovett and heaps of other recognisable faces.This film is must to see and you will probably watch it again on DVD.I guarantee you will enjoy this film unless your anal retentive.",10,1,2,6 July 2008
Jarhead," A film for those who hate the USA and Israel
","Jarhead is a really bad film which is very fetched and divorced from reality. Riding on the 'bandwagon' of Anti -American involvement in the Middle East it is nothing like the great war films like 'Full Metal Jacket', 'Paths of Glory' and 'Apocalypse Now'. I have seen many reviews from fraudulent ex-Desert Storm vets saying how great the film was but its based on lies and fabrication. Shame as I really like Sam Mende's 'American Beauty' which I know is a masterpiece but he is clearly not in Kubrick's class. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Anthony Swafford but he looks more like Iran's president Ahmadinejad and should therefore play him. Based o the book by Swafford who served in Desert Storm its a bit dodgy as you expect the only way to sell the book, as with the film, is to crap on the USA and its foreign policy as in militarist policies. Very predictable but a must for those who hate the United States. I strongly recommend this film now DVD to all young Australians as it will help them develop a total repudiation for the USA and Israel and encourage them to Join Al qaeda and similar groups and also will help break the ice for Aussie girls wishing to get Muslim boyfriends and wear Jihabs. A very fashionable film with lots images of American Atrocities against 'The Innocent' and wonderfully symbolised images of stray Arab horses covered in oil from burning oil wells. Swoff and his comrades lust to kill but the actors unfortunately look and behave to weakly to be convincing marines. Jamie Fox is however convincing as the token African -American Staff Sergeant Sykes.I gave this zero stars because its not fit for the cinema screen and is extremely boring and non-factual. However as I said those signing up for Jihad or perhaps the post modern Muslim Australian Harem will find it satisfactory to enjoyable. Perhaps its advisable to by an American flag so that you can have a party afterwards and burn it just for fun. Jarhead is Meathead.",1,3,6,18 February 2008
Ratatouille," Great animated film and also very cute.
","This wonderful Disney and Pixar animated production written and directed by Brad Bird whose other works include 'The Incredibles' explores the French restaurant gastronomy. A beautiful and very cute story about the extraordinary French rat, Remy, who is a great fan of the famous French Chef Auguste Gusteau. Remy is truly gifted with cooking. Remy discovers that his adored and TV celebrity chef has passed away but lives on in his imagination guiding him on with his create motto 'Any one can cook!!'. Remy deserts his rat family clan to pursue the culinary arts at Gusteau's restaurant which is now managed by a little evil conniving chef Skinner who thinks he can take over ownership of the famed restaurant and convert the operation into a Frozen food company using Gusteau's recipes.. A clumsy and awkward young man Linguini is seconded by special written reference to commence apprenticeship in the restaurant and Skinner soon discovers that he is the son and heir to Gusteaus restaurant. Remy also discovers that Linguini has a strong but misguided desire to cook and forms a strange partner ship with him not unlike the famous Cyrano De Bergerac story. This partnership is wildly successful and the only female chef Collette in the Kitchen develops an attraction to Linguini whilst trying to teach him the basics of cooking. Remy soon discovers Skinners plans and reveals them to Linguini and Collette and in the process reveals himself to all as the master chef behind the newly and highly successful reemergence of Gustaeus restaurant. Finally the famed and extremely strict gastronome and food critic Anton Ego endorses the miracle recipes and cooking despite the fact that little Remy is the behind it all. In his critique Anton states ' Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere' alluding to Remy's genius. Proving you don't require ' Larousse's Gastromonique' recipes to for great home cooking. Brilliant film.",10,1,2,5 February 2008
Enchanted," A beautiful fairy tale
",This innovative and original idea manages to interweave the Classic Walt Disney fairy tale themes with the reality of contemporary New York. The establishment themes of the film present us with a Princess Giselle who in reality is (played by Amy Adams who was the secretary in 'Charlie Wilson's War'). The Evil Queen Narissa is played by Susan Saradon in the reality scenes and James Marsden plays the Charming Prince Edward. In an almost surrealist theme and scene Queen Narrisa pushes the Princess through a sort of a 'worm hole' in order to banish her to the flip-side of the animated world which is Contemporary New York. Soon most of the animated characters find themselves in the real world in their real life flip-side state of being. Whilst many of grew up wishing we were part of the fantasy worlds these guys must feel pretty tripped out at finding themselves in the real world. Princess Giselle is adopted by a single Father and his young daughter who become absolutely enchanted by her. In fact you almost feel drawn to to the Princess by her overwhelming innocence and beautiful charms. I absolutely love the Walt Disney Classics and this is now one of them. A beautiful and enchanting story for all of all ages. Where are my mouseketeer ears?If you have children take them to this one its a really good and funny feel-good film.,10,1,1,4 February 2008
No Country for Old Men," Excellent intrigue and suspense
",The film opens with Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) reminiscing about how things eventual change. Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin) is hunting dear in the Rio Grande open desert West Texas country in the USA when he comes across several; vehicles and several bodies of heavily armed Mexicans in what appears to be a massive drug deal that has gone wrong as one of the vehicles contains a huge load of cocaine. Near the massacre scene he also finds a large amount of money and takes home to his trailer trash home and does not tell his trailer trash wife the details.Unfortunately for Llewelyn several parties realize he took the money and come after him. Ed Tom Bell eventually discovers Llewelyns position and desperately seeks him as he also knows that several parties are gunning for him. The most dangerous of all the hunters of Llewelyn is Anton Chigurh (played by Javier Bardem) he is a very powerful manic hunter with a weird philosophy about coins.The Coen brothers have come up with an masterpiece of action and suspense and unexpected consequences. Definitely worth seeing but disturbing violence.A great film that explores hunting from animals to humans.,10,2,7,6 July 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Most Overrated Film in History
","It is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium.These three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible. For example Peter Jackson knew that he could New Zealand Citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown New Zealand Countryside.Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost. This was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did. How the motion Picture Academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious.The cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques. This has been supported many Cinematographers in many blogs.The acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from Australians and New Zealanders due to Peter Jackson's view that they are better actors than Americans and the British. In fact Australians and New Zealanders have this strange dislike Americans despite consuming their films.The animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in 'dusk till dawn' it makes you wonder if the CGI people had much imagination. The many gratuitously violent scenes, not described as such in the books, would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the Golum. In fact most of the CGI was carried out by Americans hired by Peter Jacksons multi-million dollar CGI suite.Which at the end of the day makes you wonder where Mr Peter Jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi-million dollar film effects studio in New Zealand.The whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with Peter Jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the project.It is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination.It was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement. I fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldn't go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in CGI. I am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like John Boorman who was originally going to make the film.I am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and Peter Jackson.",1,3,12,29 June 2007
Schindler's List," Contains some errors of fact but Excellent film
","Based on the life of Notorious Nazi Party Manufacturer who uses Jewish slave labour in his factory in Krakow. Spielberg's visual accounts of the atrocities committed by Nazi's on the Jews is factual but restricted as most were too horrific to show the general public. It is a well known fact that the wealthy Jews bought their way into extended 'Freedom' by paying big bribes to actually work in Schindler's factory rather than being shipped off to extermination camps. It is also debatable as to how long the 1100 Jews Oscar Schindler 'saved' would have lasted as Jews were often worked as slaves until death after Hitler's 'Final Solution' was declared. There are more profound stories about German Officer's who turned against their own when witnessing the atrocities by their fellow Germans but the overwhelming fact remains that it is largest and most efficiently executed act of genocide in Human History committed by one Race over a particular race and religion. The Nazi's murdered six million Jews of the six and half million in Europe and of the 275,000 survivors 250,00 had died by 1970. This represented two thirds of all Jews in the world at the time. A great classic of a film with excellent performances by Ben Kingsley, Liam Neeson and Larry Fiennes. It was a huge international box office success but didn't too well in Australia.",10,4,12,8 March 2008
The Mist," Silly film with quasi religious overtones.
","I am told the 'THE MIST' in some European languages means garbage in this case the translation applies. Stephen King as usual has turned the normal average Mid -west USA town from one dimensional mediocrity to madness and mayhem within the opening section of the film. Frank Darabont directs the film and after his great films like GREEN MILE this one must be a bit embarrassing. We see a strange mist settle over the town and along with it large array of massive and deadly insects , tentacle bearing monsters and various large deadly and nasty creatures. The protagonist of the film is David Drayton played by Thomas Jane (Punisher, The Thin Red Line) and he goes into town with his son and his African -American neighbour Brent Norton ( Andre Braugher) a Big town Lawyer who turns out to be very unpopular in the town. As the mist and the monsters engulf the town Drayton and his son along with Norton and several other shoppers take refuge in the local supermarket. As the film painfully drags along we find that fear and ignorance of most of the shoppers in the Supermarket become as great a risk the monsters outside. This happens because of a Bible -Bashing woman incites religious fanaticism amongst the shoppers to the extent that she has convinced them that the few unbelievers should be sacrificed to God's monsters that have taken over the earth. Drayton and his level headed crew in the Supermarket find themselves having to escape the mad mob in the supermarket and even having to kill the mad preacher. Drayton and his crew escape in a four wheel drive but a few die in the process as the monsters are everywhere. Eventually Drayton his son and two other survivors become stranded and the consequences are as unrealistic as they are tragic. The characters in this film are as pathetic as the notoriously mediocre M. Night Shyamalan type of films in fact the the religious overtones and style of anti-climatic deadly creatures is very much down at that level.",6,0,3,18 June 2008
I Am Legend," I am Lame
","This should be renamed 'I am Lemon' as it is just another really stupid Zombie movie. Will Smith plays the main character, Robert Neville, and is supposed to be one of the few surviving humans who happens to be a Military Scientist. One assumes he is naturally immune but then he takes a blood sample from an almost cured zombie as a last salvation for the human race to use to save itself. It does not medically or scientifically make any sense. Neville discovery that he is not the last human survivor of the earth's population six billion when another survivor saves him is the most pathetic part of the film. His behavior is at this stage is juvenile inarticulate and mentally challenged and sinks to its lowest point when he attempts to sum up human civilization with a Bob Marley Album.The alpha Zombie like the one in 'Resident Evil: extinction' bears amazing resemblance to Midnight Oil's Pete Garret and appears to be as Manic. The aggressive Zombie dogs are also taken from the first Resident Evil. If you are into the usual gory scenes of human flesh eating frenzies and screaming zombies and the usual scenes of major cities evacuated and dead then see this one for your entertainment.I have given this one star for the performance by the German shepherd, 'Sam' , that lifted the dull acting of the other characters.I now know who played Sam in'I am Lemon' it was Abby and Will Smith try to buy the dog when he finished the film but great actors are not for sale so Will will just have to go to Drama school.As for all the other reviewers who thought this was a great movie you must all be as thick as a brick or have really simple minds.Finally I think that Abby should win an Oscar for acting since he will be against Russel 'flabby two expressions' Crowe.",1,8,10,6 July 2008
School of Rock," Great Film comedy
","Dewy Finn played by Jack Black is a dynamic formularised lead guitarist who gets sacked from his band not so much for his exuberant performances but his inability to fit into the Rock Star image of being Anorexic thin slim and tall instead he is short and obese. He shares a flat with his long time close friend Ned Schneebly played by Mike White who actually wrote the screenplay. Submissive Ned now has a dominating girlfriend who has steered him into a steady career as a School teacher instead of his old pursuits as a musician with Dewey who is still determined to succeed but is behind with the rent and bills. Ned's girlfriend gives Dewey an ultimatum to pay his debts or get out in fact she wants to end the friendship with her partner. Dewey answers a telephone call for Ned which is an invitation by a top private school to be a substitute teacher. Dewey pretends he is Ned and takes the appointment on for the money. He finds himself in charge of some children with a private school educational path and all are very good students. He struggles to find a way into 'winging' his new role until he discovers that many in the class are very competent musicians in their classical music class. He sets up a new and secretive lass on formularised Rock and Roll band with management , stage crew and entourage skills as well. The class responds with excellence to the level that he persuades the school principal a highly strung woman played by Joan Cusack that the class should attend a music concert whilst instead he has entered them in a 'Battle of Bands' competition. Ned's girlfriend discovers Dewey's plan and informs the police . The parents are shocked and Joan Cusack is on the verge of a breakdown. The students then rebel and drag Dewey out to the band competition as they are determined to perform. The parents, the principal and Ned rush to the venue to retrieve their children.A beautifully scripted film which encapsulates inspiration and determination A real gem!!!.",10,1,1,7 March 2008
Children of Men," For those who believe Isarel should be wiped out and that Britain should be a new African and Palestinian homeland.
","This is not only one of the worst films I have ever seen its politics are really ignorant and pseudo leftist rubbish.Actor Clive Owen The meets up with an old mate plays Theo Tharon is kidnapped and/or seconded by an ex-girlfriend Julian (Julianne Moore) who runs a quasi terrorist group in the year 2027. This special terrorist group is against the British governments new laws which apparently have all third world country in particular Middle eastern immigrants locked up in cyclone fenced camps at the various points of the transport hub of Britain. In this ridiculous forecast of the future the human race is now totally sterile except for one pregnant African woman but there is no explanation as to why. Theo meets up with an old mate Jasper (Michael Caine) who is an old burnt out hippy who still takes drugs and listens to music of that era in his little hideaway in the forests of Britain. Jasper assists Theo in his mission given to him by Julia to guard the pregnant women and guide her to the safety of some unknown destination accessible by small boat from Britain which must be Northern Africa or Spain which is a bit Ironic.There are scenes of a breakout by Immigration detainees which all happen to be Palestinian refugees which add to the revolutionary and liberationists ardour of the film's theme.I am left with the distinct impression at this point that the hidden message of the film is not only that should Israel give relinquish its territories and existence but that Britain should open its doors to unlimited Palestinian immigration.Why Michael Caine participated in this film beggars belief like wise with Clive Owen maybe there was a huge amount of money behind it.I strongly recommend this film to all individuals that believe overpopulation is a myth and that sterility is threatening population numbers in Africa, the Middle East, India and China and the world in general and have no border control and unlimited immigration.",1,3,11,30 March 2008
The Dark Knight," The film was contrived long boring and designed for a captive audience
","Having negative opinions about this film does not constitute 'Trolling' as defined by Wikipedia. The film was entertaining but was arguably worse than other Batman films from the past. There appeared to be a shift from the Comic book hero being the main protagonist to the 'Joker' being the main character. The purpose of such a film had more to do with the marketing of the film within the controversy of and blatant exploitation the Actor Heath Ledger's death. This has lead to arguably and debatable claims about Ledger's performance in the film. This is understandable as his fans will not tolerate any negativity with regards his performance. as a result this message board is dominated by those who totally dismiss the great performance of other Batman villains such as Danny De Vito as the Penguin and the list is long. There as has been some very intelligent comments detailing how this film veers from the comic book hero, upon which it is based, to a dark 'Cop' film. None the less the film is a hit and Ledger fans expect Heath Ledger's role as the 'Joker' to earn an Oscar and go down as the greatest performance of an actor in the history of Film. I personally believe that Heath Ledger's and Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the Joker a bit too morbid but none the less effective as a villain. Overall the film was contrived and formulated and the script was a bit dodgy as far as story line but so are all Comic Book hero films. I thought Christian Bale's performance as Batman was great but the digitally enhanced voice effect made him seem too dark a Knight. In fact judging by this forum one would think that Batman was now the villain and the 'Joker' was the great good guy. It was far from being a great film and eventually the hysteria from the more juvenile minds will subside and the film will fade into the esoteric world of the 'Batman' collector.",1,46,149,19 July 2008
Into the Wild," Dumb and futile death by misadventure by a spoiled rich kid
","This really stupid glorification tribute film financed by the extremely wealthy McCandless whose son died a futile death from poisoning , starvation and overexposure in the Alaskan wilderness. Having graduated from Emory University the super spoiled typical rich kid rebels against what is expected of him by his parents. Like most of his type knowing full well he can always fall back on his parents wealth when it suits them to do so he then sets out on squandering his allowance after reportedly having donating his allowance to charity. The character playing his sister provides a narrative throughout the film providing a rational that his parents premarital experiences as well as their highly strained marriage as the reason for his escape into irresponsible living.This mainly fantasized account of Chris McCandless's last stage of life includes all these encounters that paint him as a much loved eccentric character idolized by young women, a grain farmer, welfare workers, burnt out hippies and an old man who wants to adopt him. He breaks ecological laws by rafting down the Colorado river without a permit to Mexico where he sweet talks his way back into the USA without ID papers. McCandless then finishes his little road trip adventure with a hunting trip to the Alaskan wilderness. Despite being fully equipped and armed the idiot McCandless manages to die of a combination of starvation, poisoning and over exposure. Sean Penn directs this silly film which will no doubt find fans amongst superficial young women and other well to do hippie types. I suspect these types of films inspire young people to take foolish paths in life that only the rich can afford to take and have seen this happen to friends of mine with similar disastrous consequences. I'm giving it one star because maybe it will inspire other idiots to perish in the wilderness. I was not keen on the wasteful shooting of Alaskan wildlife for McCandless's camping experiment. Great comedy material.",1,125,196,13 April 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the true great film classics of all time.
",Not only unique for its time but one of the greatest Science fiction films of all time. Made without CGI on a very lean budget in today's adjusted figures. Stanley Kubrick made this film without the high shooting ratio he normally has. Stanley Kubrick is without doubt the greatest director in History thus far.This film was cut from five hours to two hours and twenty minutes and the art direction was superb.Stanley Kubrick and the great Aurthur C. Clarke collaborated to write this time less classic.Aliens a special message on Earth at the dawn of Human Kind and one on the Moon which modern man finds .Finally Humans accompanied by the most advanced computer ever made set of to Jupiter the find the next monumental message which turns out to be a gateway.Any one who studied film and/or wishes to be a part of the film industry or just enjoy great films must experience this film .If you don't like it then you belong to Bollywood or your a true Aussie.,10,3,9,18 January 2008
Avatar," Entertaining soft porn eye candy
",The special effects were enjoyable but the film really lacked substance. The tribal nature of the 'smurfette' blue aliens closely resembled the tribal peoples of earth in quasi montage of African and Red-Indian semiotics permeating throughout the images and customs and even accents. Cameron then very subtly adds animated nippled breasts and other body parts to guarantee the titillation of a massive audience of young males and I even heard male teenagers commenting on these aspects as we left the Cinema as well as general feedback from this group. It is beyond credibility that the Americans depicted as the evil military complex invading a planet and destroying all that is natural would have in that context would have completely annihilate this small tribe of only a few thousand using biological warfare let alone incendiary missiles. They certainly would not have allowed the far fetched experiments of mind transformation into biological clones especially using a crippled marine. If the mineral cost 20 million for kilogram one wonders what the hell it was used for. The whole film was ridiculous and pathetic. To all you lovers of this movie I am so glad I am separated from you tasteless fools with this film. Sam Worthington emerges as yet another expressionless ugly Australian actor who has used his families wealth to hit the big time.Of course the film has been a great financial success but so is Macca's hamburgers proving once again that junk food and films are gratifying to the masses but really lacking in true wholesome substance.,10,9,17,6 January 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Brilliant Classic on the problems with 'Aversion Therapy'
","This extra-ordinary classic novel by Anthony Burgess originally sold to the Rolling Stones for $500 was picked up by the great Stanley Kubrick who wrote the screenplay and produced and directed it. The film set in the future uses a language created by Burgess , Nadsat, which is a mixture of English and Russian slang. Story revolves around a stylistic gang leader Alex and his gang the droogs. Alex and his mates not only indulge in violent robberies involving rape but also attack rival gangs with their successful style of ultra violence. Alex also loves seducing very young teenage girls for group sex and this is displayed in the film at high speed to William Tells Overture. He is also obsessed with Beethoven's 9th symphony in D minor which gives him delusions off grandeur and manic elation especially during a scene when he turns on his fellow gang members. A graphic scene follows where Alex and his subjugated gang carry out a home invasion to the theme of the Rossini's Thieving Magpies overture. Alex is caught and imprisoned for the murder of the old spinster owner. Alex undergoes a new and radical procedure of 'Aversion Therapy' to suppress his violent and sexual tendencies. Unfortunately this therapy also leaves Alex unable to function within the realms of his personality creating disastrous Psychological problems. Alex is unable to defend himself when attacked by various of his victims including his former fellow gang members who are now Police. Eventually Alex stumbles across a wealthy political activist Mr Alexander who is trying to overthrow the government and seeks solace with him. Unfortunately for Alex Mr Alexander recognises him as the man who raped and murdered his wife during a home invasion. Mr Alexander tries to expose the Governments use of Aversion therapy as an abuse of human rights but it backfires and Alex becomes a hero indulged upon by the Government. Kubrick withdrew the film when censored in Britain. It a classic on every level.",10,0,3,9 April 2008
Shine," A ridiculous film based on on fiction and much overrated
",This highly over rated Australian film about the life of David Helfgott by David Hicks that won Geoffrey Rush an Oscar probably because of the powerful and Misguided self-loathing Jewish Lobby of the American Academy Motion Picture Board.We are lead to believe that Helfgott has an oppressive and deprived Jewish upbringing when in fact it was more like a German upbringing and in fact it has been widely rumoured that the Helfgott family where not only German and not Jewish but also very wealthy. This totally contradicts the film. The Jewish barmitzva depicted in the film is totally unauthentic as is the exaggeration of the mental state of David Helfgott.In real life Helfgott is an eccentric character with a bit of a stutter who is a highly competent classical pianist. The film celebrates his life with an over exaggerated emphasis on Helfgott's achievement of overcoming his supposed mentally challenged and anti-social personality. The film is ridiculous as it is fictitious.,1,6,23,7 March 2008
The Happening," Another pathetic film in fact one of the worst I have ever seen
",I have just seen one of the worst films ever made...'The Happening' in which nothing is happening which makes 'The Happening' nothing.One of my favorite actors Mark Wahlberg obviously did the film for the money as he spurts out his share of ridiculous gibberish dialogue. He is the only name actor in this ridiculous film about a huge toxic breaking wind. The film defies all scientific and medical plausibility about how toxic contagious spread. Also the idea that a virus or 'bug' could suddenly make you violently and actively suicidal is so crazy it's make you laugh. Especially the scene in which a man suicides by letting his industrial lawn mower ride over him and another scene about an elderly women who kills herself by headbutting windows and walls. Those scenes left the audience in screaming fits of laughter.The film reached a new cinematic low when Wahlberg's character communicates from a room in house to an 'OutShed' some thirty metres away through a pipe in the wall. Even a twelve year old could figure out that you don't get high fidelity sound through old water pipes over a long distance that must also have perpendicular bends.I also noticed M. Night Shyamalan carefully places Indian nationals in almost every scene and they surely must be family and friends.Shyamalan uses his usually cliché suspense and intrigue techniques combined with scenes of graphic blood and gore to the standard measure.The scenes of people monitoring the magnitude of the suicidal virus on the TV news in public cliché is about as cliché as you can get. I think that most people need a leader to unleash that side of them that can see the the absolutely ridiculous side to things they see otherwise they sink into this quiet reverence and dismay at the graphically violent scenes. This film had no scientific plausibility and the way Wahlberg delivered his lines made me certain he was offered a great deal of money for the role. He is a really great actor why he stooped to this ridiculous crap alludes me. The act of suicide is a combination of complicated deep-seated depression combined with the long standing premeditated sense of purpose or some really passionate psychologically motivated processes. The act itself has never been associated with organically or other forms of toxicity and even if when a physiological imbalance or causality could be diagnosed the onset of the act of suicide would and could not be that sudden. I mean if the mental faculties were available to determine which process would result in death then surely other faculties would be operative. Which ever way you look at it the process was ridiculous. Also why in America? why not in some extremely populated region like India where the Director M. Night Shyamalan comes from. I guess in India the only way to suicide would be drowning in the open sewer puddles which would also look pretty funny. Imagine 1600 million people in such a highly populated place with negligible means of suicide people would be head butting each other for months. Another really stupid film by this way too over-rated Film director M. Night Shyamalan. He should stick to Bollywood films that have Indian nationals dancing around 'Maypoles' as they celebrate the grant of their Australian permanent residence or the birth of their eight child here. Shyamalan must be a hot favorite for the Rasberry award this year. Minus ten stars and its good night M. Night Shyamalan never again!,1,1,4,3 July 2008
A Beautiful Mind," Big deal and bad acting
","Another highly over-rated Hollywood film for which half the budget was spent on Marketing and the purchase of Oscars for the 'Actors'.A fictional and very boring story about a a socially and mentally challenged mathematician who wins the Nobel prize for his Economic postulations which were of little consequence in History. The most over-rated so called Actor of contemporary History, Russell Crowe plays John Nash whilst the his doting Girlfriend and then wife is played by Jennifer Connelly.Russel Crowe has the usual two facial expressions of arrogant and conceited throughout the film along with his monotone mumbling voice.This film is poorly directed and drags on like a midday TV soapy about someone who is a misunderstood genius for some strange and confusing reason. Possibly all that study and a closed and unexposed wealthy upbringing brought about this strange anti-social behaviour which is interpreted as some type of mental illness as in that other highly over-rated fictional biography 'Shine'.This film and Shine prove that Oscars can be bought.",1,3,9,7 July 2008

There Will Be Blood," A deeply disturbing but excellent film
","There have been assertions made that this deeply disturbing and powerful film, directed by the great Paul Thomas Anderson (' Boogie Nights' 'Magnolias'), somehow parallels Modern America because it involves an American Oil Baron and greed. However it it is set at a time when the Saudi Oil family a was monstrous, uncivilized warlike and brutal regime far worse than America. It maybe that The problem lies that Australians and similar western societies are immersed into this populist and mindless antipathy toward America that the subject of Oil barons ignites preposterous and ignorant theories that consume the sophist conspiracies of contemporary youth. This film is begins in 1898 with the arduous struggle of a silver and gold miner Daniel Plainview played by Daniel Day-Lewis. Daniel develops the mine and employs men to help him including a widowed father with a baby who subsequently dies in a mining accident. Daniel adopts the baby boy and names him H.W..

August Rush," Really dumb
","Kirsten Sheridan got to direct this screenplay through her Father Director Jim Sheridan. This Film is truly ridiculous its about a filthy rich spoiled girl Lyla Novachec (Kerrie Russel) who is a concert cellist who meets a wealthy contrived cliché Irish prima-dona Rock Star Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and has unprotected sex on the first night without even getting undressed to do it. As with the dumb Juno she manages to get pregnant straight away. Louis's accent is more Scottish than Irish. Lyla has the baby but somehow her father tels her that the baby was lost whilst adopting it out. Of course this is totally impossible in the American Private Hospital system and she would have had to sign a thousand forms , and with her wealth she would have been a private insured patient and the nurses and doctors would have informed her of every detail. Finally what of the funeral of the baby? Look it was totally pathetic from that point. The music in the film was the epitome of mediocrity with the exception a precocious African -American girl who was part of a soul Gospel choir and these types are not rare in the USA these days. Lyla's baby Evan Taylor alias August Rush (Freddie Highmore) grows up to be a grinning introvert who makes his way back to New York and becomes part of the this busking empire headed by a busking pimp Maxwell played by Robin Williams. August Rush has this extraordinary ability to play guitar like a fifty year old accomplished genius on his first try and a few days later is writing symphonies with full musical notation on his first attempt which is absurd and impossible. The whole idea of the story is the fated re-union of the mediocre musicians Lyla and Louis with there genetically inherited musical genius son August by magical coincidence at the famous Julliard School for the rich concert. Apparently August had won a scholarship to Julliard which is ridiculous as it is a school for the very wealthy only. A schmaltzy movie for morons",1,21,33,20 March 2008
American Gangster," Overarted film and Russell Crowe cannot Act
","Denzel Wahington unconvincingly plays Drug Mogul Frank Lucas who becomes one of America's most ruthless Heroin distributors in 1960's by sourcing pure Heroin from Vietnam during the war there. Inexplicably Frank Lucas inherits this African-American organised group and manages to import pure heroin through use of the American Military forces in Vietnam. On one hand Lucas has this heroin empire which must have connections running to the top of American executive government to have pulled thus off over a period of time and on the other hand he operates outside the internal corruption of the New York Police and other enforcement agencies who eventually play a major part in his down fall . Denzel is as unconvincing as he was in 'Training Day' and play good guys.Ridley Scott manages once again to pull off another epic , blockbuster type film with the most incredulous cliché story line and badly cast actors. I refer to Scott's use of Russel Crowe who plays New York Cop Det Richie Roberts. Like in 'Gladiator' is to flabby , fat , morose, monotone and expressionless to play an action hero. Anyone who thinks Crowe is even a fair actor is deluded his accent was pathetic for a New York Jewish Cop let alone a strong determined one. Crowe's body language and his awkwardness in even with just plain walking make him the most overrated actor in Film History since Cate Blanchett and Toni Collet. Scott last great film was 'Aliens' which was more a success for its art direction than his directing and since he has produced a string of mediocre but highly successful films. The success of this film is more due to its production marketing values and lacks substance. Scott's scenes of the damage that Heroin does set against the excesses of Crime bosses would hardly surprise even the most unaware audience these days. The main message of this film is that even if you cannot act if you are rich enough you can end up being cast as a hero a in a big budget films. Action entertainmentThis film is full of the same old drug trafficking conspiracy theories connected to the Vietnam war and south east Asia. The worst aspect is that it has Russel Crowe who cannot act to save his life. This flabby aging old mole faced bastard has two expressions on his face arrogant and conceited. When is America going to get over its adulation of wealthy and privileged Australians buying their way into the best roles and then buying Oscars. The United States of America has plenty of great actors and its a pity Denzel Washington and other great Actors have to appear in films in which Australians give it the kiss of death. America be ashamed.",1,13,25,7 January 2008
1408," Attempt at horror
","Mike Enslin ( Played by John Cusack) is a hack Los Angeles writer and one of his main themes is the debunking of paranormal phenomena. He definitely does not possess fear of or believe in the supernatural or ghosts. He receives a strange post card inviting him to room 1408 at the New Tork Hotel, The Dolphin. So this struggling writer ends up curious enough to travel to New York and book a room 1408 but the hotel manager Gerald Olin, played by Samuel Jackson, desperately tries to persuade Enslin that the room is indeed haunted and that there has been some 50 recorded and unrecorded deaths in it since the Hotel was opened. Olins efforts to deter Enslin only spur him on so he allows him to book the room. He is warned that no one last more than an hour in the room.After Enslin settles in the room his view on the supernatural radically changes after he initially thinks he is hallucinating on drug spiked alcohol. Enslin goes through a harrowing experience which has spiritual and religious overtones.He even comes in to contact with a loved one whom he lost tragically. Not a bad flick for young teenage couples in a boring summer evening. Most movies of these genre are totally implausible but I guess that is part of the appeal.",6,0,0,6 July 2008
Iron Man," A Bit Robo -Coppish
","WOW!! What a let down!!!!Robert DowneyJnr plays the arrogant and conceited super rich Jack Stark CEO of Stark weapons manufacture who travels to Afghanistan to release a new and more powerful and destructive Cluster type Missile system his company has developed. Soon after would his convoy is ambushed by a group of terrorists using his own companies weapons. Although he is fatally injured the terrorist group has a doctor who performs revolutionary pacemaker surgery to keep him alive and prevent shrapnel from shredding Jack's heart. They have kept him alive in order to get Jack Stark to build new missile weapons for them. Instead he build the prototype Iron Man suit. From this point I was getting Deja-vu for the 'ROBOCOP' film. In the Iron Man suit Jack makes his escape and gets rescued and returned to his great empire at home. Here we see his assistant Pepper Potts, the newly and obviously surgically modified transformed Gwyneth Paltrow, assisting him with his most personal chores such as seeing off young sexy reporter groupies and performing Heart pace maker surgery. Jack eventually discovers via the same sexy groupie reporter that his late father's former partner and major shareholder , Obadia Stone ( Jeff Bridges) is selling STARK weapons to enemies of the USA in Afghanistan and that he ordered Jack's murder in Afghanistan in order to take over STARK which makes you wonder why he let him survive in the first place. There are some great visual effects in this film but the final showdown is a copy of 'ROBOCOP' even in the way Jack Starks IRONMAN defeats the much more powerful and larger Obadia Stone's IRON MAN. Like Transformers this film has little to offer except flash special effects scenes which getting a bit passe every time they are used in this way.I am giving it two stars for its entertainment value for young teenagers.",6,1,4,3 July 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Cate Blanchette a joke that should play Reinhardt Hiendrich
","Shekhar Kapur once again gives us a complete distortion of history of the reign of Queen Elizabeth the first. The casting of the very masculine Cate Blanchett as Queen Elizabeth is also disaster as the original Queen Elizabeth was a highly sexual creature from the age of about fourteen. Furthermore Queen Elizabeth was a very stoic person who showed no emotion to anyone in an age where royalty really was a sign of divinity. Cate Blanchett and the director are unable to capture the ruthlessness of the Queen Elizabeth nor even a close track of the historical sequence of events. There are many period films depicting great sea battles and this one is not that impressive. Geoffry Rush appears as Sir Francis Walsingham adviser to the Queen but is better suited to playing an Evil Pirate in line with his acting ability.There have been much better films about the reign of Queen Elizabeth the first and the events at the time but students should stick to the documentaries and History texts if they want academic credibility.I think this film would have been more entertaining if Shekhar Kapur gave it the Bollywood treatment with lots of Indian costumes , singing and dancing around decorated trees and re;eased it in his native India. I really believe that Cate Blanchett is best suited to Bollywood films or playing a the role of her look alike General Reinhardt Heinrich head of the Nazi Gestapo.",1,11,19,17 January 2008
The Deer Hunter," A classic Vietbam War film
","Written and directed by Michael Cimino was one of his few films and was one of the very first Vietnam war films. Originally Hollywood would not back the film but eventually did during its making. Set in the sixties it is about a group of Russian -American men young men who work together in a Pennsylvania steel foundry and also go deer hunting together in the nearby mountains. The three main characters Michael (Robert De Niro), Stephen (John Savage), Nick (Christopher Walken) are heavily ensconced in the local Russian community and party and hunt together with their other friends Stan (John Cazale) and John ( George Dzundza). Michael and Nick also share a strong and competing affection for Linda (Meryl Streep) but she is with Nick. Stephen gets married and then the three main character's enlist to fight in Vietnam. In Vietnam they get captured and all become separated and the tragedy of the war begins for them. Their Viet Cong captors force them to play 'Russian Roulette' which Michael uses to successfully overcome them and escape. They subsequently become separated and Michael returns to the USA to learn the fate of his friends and deal with the emotional aftermath of their community. He returns to Vietnam in an attempt to rescue Nick who has succumbed to drugs and the seediest side of South Vietnam.Great and strong performances from all the actors earned the film 5 Oscars including best supporting actor for Christopher Walken who got paid $US25,000 for his role.The film skillfully juggles between the chaotic miasma of Vietnam and the small American Industrial town. The 'Russian Roulette scenes have become a film legend. There is a sort of irony in this 1st major Vietnam war film in that the Russians were fighting with the North Vietnamese and the protagonists were Russian. The film deals more with the tragedy of war more than the politics. John Cazale was dying of cancer during the filming and died shortly afterwards. A great Classic.",10,0,1,26 May 2008
Beowulf," Very Dumb film
","Based on the 9th century poem that J. R. Tolkien heralded as great work of Art Beowulf was chosen by Zemeckis and his producers as a worthy venture in novelty digital 3D cinema production. Hrothgar an aging old obese Viking type warrior played by Anthony Hopkins and oppressed his wife, the young blonde busty ice queen who appears resigned to this duty of oppression and readily appears to subjugate her soul to him, reign over a rowdy primitive bunch of trashy Viking warriors in their newly built communal Mead 'beer' hall. Hrothgar half naked scene and his mates go berko on one of their feasts and the noise provokes the deformed Grendal, son of strange female creature played by Angela Jolie. Grendal gatecrashes the Horthgar's beer fest and brutally and violently mutilates and tears the Viking partygoers to pieces. The animated form of Jolie shows likeness to Jolie except for the body which is far too voluptuous and well proportional than the real Jolie.Later, Beowulf (Ray Winstone) answers the call to slay Grendal. When Grendal next attacks the Mead hall Beouwulf strips naked to kill Grendal and mortally wounds him. Grendal's mother goes to Meadhall to avenge her son's death and kills nearly all Beouwulfs men and from their seduces Beouwulf. We learn that Grendal was actually Hrothgar's son and when Beouwulf goes to cave to meet Grendals mothers he is seduced resulting in offspring a dragon monster.Beowulf returns to the Mead hall and becomes the new leader of the vikings after Hrothgar suicides realizes his queen wants Beowulf. The dragon returns and Beowulf goes into battle with it. A very entertaining animated 3D film although this style of cinema is more suited to those who play computer games but worth seeing.",7,0,1,6 July 2008

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Most overrated film in History
","It is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium.These three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible. For example Peter Jackson knew that he could New Zealand Citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown New Zealand Countryside.Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost. This was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did. How the motion Picture Academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious.The cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques. This has been supported many Cinematographers in many blogs.The acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from Australians and New Zealanders due to Peter Jackson's view that they are better actors than Americans and the British. In fact Australians and New Zealanders have this strange dislike Americans despite consuming their films.The animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in 'dusk till dawn' it makes you wonder if the CGI people had much imagination. The many gratuitously violent scenes, not described as such in the books, would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the Golum. In fact most of the CGI was carried out by Americans hired by Peter Jacksons multi-million dollar CGI suite.Which at the end of the day makes you wonder where Mr Peter Jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi-million dollar film effects studio in New Zealand.The whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with Peter Jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the project.It is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination.It was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement. I fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldn't go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in CGI. I am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like John Boorman who was originally going to make the film.I am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and Peter Jackson.",1,16,54,29 June 2007
Munich," Spielberg support for the return Palestinian homeland from Israel
","Steven Spielberg explores the assassination and murder of eleven Israeli Athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics by one of the many Palestinian Liberation groups known as 'Black September'. Spielberg demonstrates that extremism of the Israeli Secret Service Mossad in exacting revenge by the perpetrators of the Munich Massacre. He clearly shows how the Israelis acted illegally in murdering the members of Black September and the futility of revenge. Spielberg masterfully manages to present the views of the Black September who committed the terrorist act as a means to tell the world that they want their homeland , Palestine back from the Israelis. It is refreshing to see films that give some understanding of the injustices committed against the virtually unarmed Palestinians when their country was taken forcefully by the formation of Israel in 1948. Although Spielberg is of Jewish background he has managed to produce a film that condemns Israel and presents us with the concept that the Munich Massacre may have some justification. He did however fail to highlight the fact that the German Government deliberately failed to save the Israeli athletes by putting the hostage incident in the hands of proved incompetent German Police and Public servants almost ensuring the death of the hostages. A huge fault with the film is that Israeli Mossad Operative Avner ( Eric Bana) has flashbacks of the incident which could not have possibly experienced which made me really wonder about the over rated Spielberg directing skills. Bana's moribund and monotone droll depiction of his character combined with Geoffrey Rush's character , head of the Mossad makes the Israeli's look like incompetent but determined clowns who come close to murdering innocent children. No mention is made of the Israeli Stern gang and their acts of Terrorism.This is a very significant film which should be shown in all schools so they get an alternate view to the Israeli-American view of the Middle East.",10,1,2,7 March 2008
300," Really stupid over-glorification of the Greek Race
",A stupid animated film about the 300 Spartans that fought the Persians back in 480 BC.The film is ridiculous from start to finish and I suggest people see the Kirk Douglas version.The concept that a period film should resemble a computer game should appeal to usual bunch.Doesn't anyone realize that Greeks are really short stumpy people with lots of thick course black hair and one eyebrow? That's what was wrong with TROY it had blond Greeks . I am not saying that Greeks are not great people they in fact are its just they have their physical racial characteristics that are well known.,1,2,6,5 July 2008
Donnie Darko," Trendy fashion garbage
","Donnie Darko played by Jake Gyllenhall commences with edgy shots that attempt to portray him as a dysfunctional schizophrenic teen. We see the very ugly one eye-browed Donnie appearing as part of a Handsome American Nuclear family that he does not appear to genetically connect with, except for his sister who seems also out of place and this despite his first set of massive facial reconstructive surgery, Pectoral implants and upper lip implants . The engine of an airliner falls out of the sky and hits the bedroom of Donnie while he is out sleeping on the golf course. Drew Barrymore appears in the first twenty minutes of the film as Donnie's literature teacher of class Karen Pomeroy. Donnie keeps having surrealistic dreams of a rabbit face character addressing him. Donnie walks around grinning to himself. As expected the new good-looking girl Jenna Malone, played by Gretchen Ross, of the class who is also dysfunctional quickly develops a relationship with the ugly and awkward Donnie. The relationship develops in the same stereotypical American teen boy meets girl films. As the film progresses Donnie sessions with his analyst in which he masturbates under hypnosis. Donnie is bullied at school but hangs with his mates whilst he indulges in hobby of target shooting.. Donnie continues to hallucinate with the half man half rabbit with big teeth and grey eyes harassing him. Gellenhall is introduced to a book by one of the teachers the philosophy of Time travel by an ex-teacher at his school Roberta Sparrow who turns out to be the old woman repeated seen on a road. Eventually the film concludes with Donnie saving his girl friend from death by use of time travel. This art-house cult classic is highly over-rated and was used to establish the wealthy and privileged Jake and Maggie Gyllenhall into highly stylized Hollywood film careers with the assistance of their mate Drew Barrymore who also comes from a great film family dynasty.

The Simpsons Movie," For die hard Simpson fans
",This film was a major disappointment and is not even doing well as a rental. Only die hard fans of the Simpson's will enjoy it but hey they warn you at the start of the movie that's its a rip off. This turns out to be my shortest review ever but thats all it deserves and by the way the 'SpiderPig' song is really dumb.Most of my friends rightly love the Simpson but the film was designed to exploit the fan base.If you are a collector then you are forced to buy it.I suppose it serves as a great example of the comedy genre.Still good family entertainment.,7,1,3,5 July 2008
Atonement," A sad and romantic tale
","Based on the novel by Ian Mcewan.

Briony has a passionate teen crush on Cecilia's boyfriend Robbie Turner played by James Mcavoy. Robbie is the house keeper's son. Briony makes a very strong almost sexual advance to Robbie which he totally repudiates and she is hurt terribly by this rejection.Briony witnesses one of her young girlfriends having sex with a much older man and accuses Robbie of the being the older man.

Briony realizes what she has done and tries to atone but the long term consequences of actions were far beyond she could ever imagine. A tale of unrequited love for Briony. Other reviewers have mentioned the steady cam and four minute long shooting on the beach in France but this is common these days . The cinematography and the overall production values were superb. A very beautiful and touching love story with great performances from all the actors. A very sad and melancholy love story.Those who enjoyed the great film ' A Long Engagement' will really enjoy this one. If you are not moved by this film you have a heart of stone.",10,3,6,17 January 2008

Only the top four teams chosen in this league will survive so Jackie hires a ready to retire pro named Monix ( Woody Harrelson) to lift his team.The level of humour is not particular strong in this film and Will's comedy style gets a bit tedious.
