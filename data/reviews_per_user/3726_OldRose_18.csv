Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Technological wonder; 'plotless wonder' !
","After a long absence OldRose returns to her fans with a new review...!Having been significantly older than the viewing populace at-large when the the first trilogy aired in 1977, -80, and -83, I can only marvel at what may have happened to George Lucas in fifteen years of hiatus. Whereas a target audience ranged quite widely back then, I'd say it doesn't now. Perfect for the 8-18 crowd this movie left most whom I know beyond those tender numbers wondering just what happened.  And did we really need a character indicative of a monotheistic religious 'devil' who wears make-up like Freddy Krueger (or has everyone forgotten about him already?)  Trouble is, we can all-too-easily guess Episodes 2 and 3 now, something that would not have happened with something of a plot worthy of such fan support.  Rating (of 5 stars): 4 - on techno-aspects alone; plot = 2. (NOTA BENE: did we really need unmistakeable 'ethnicitism' with some of the puppet characters, an ecological-destroyed 'main' planet ('100% city'), plus the aforementioned devil/Freddy Krueger - and other such trivialities that trilogy no.1 was entirely without...? Ah well, I'll just have to hang around long enough to see what gets thrown at us next in nos. 2 and 3!)",8,0,0,8 October 1999
As Good as It Gets," One of the best three films of 1997 !
","The Oscar nominations were well deserved in this one and the actor winners made for an excellent pair.  The story entices slowly in the beginning, but Nicholson's wit and humour won't keep you waiting for long.  It's a great film during which you'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll feel the full range of emotions that the character Melvin, the seemingly hopeless obsessive/ compulsive writer feels and experiences with depth and intensity. There isn't enough I can say about this film, having been a fan of Nicholson's for may years, except that this may be his magnum opus.  Newbe's Hunt and Kinnear were both definite Oscar calibre as well, and Cuba Gooding Jr. continues to impress, even here in a minor role. One of the three best films of 1997 in my opinion; get to the cinemas NOW while you can still catch it. Top rating (5 stars of 5) !",10,0,0,8 January 1999
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Great supporting but awful lead casting...
","Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: 'Captain Correli´s Mandolin', just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in 'Blow' -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful.  But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability.  Next, a superb performance by John Hurt (Cruz´s father, the village doctor) of Oscar Callibre, as well as by Irene Papas, each as village elders, as well as by Christian Bale (Papas´ son) among the village freedom fighters, go far towards counter-balancing awkward performances (especially at the beginning) by Cruz and Cage. Nicely, the last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses, but it´s teeth-gnashing early on.  Finally, the scenery itself and the photography could garner a technical award, and such provides pleasant distractions when most needed.  John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations and this would be a third; I hope he gets it as his performance as the Doctor makes this film worth seeing.  The true test of a supporting actor/actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the personage in question, and in this case, it would most certainly not be... not even close.Entertainment value but for the aformentioned plus factors which do help raise the bar.  See it if you haven´t.  Rating = 3.5 stars (of five).",7,1,3,29 December 2001
Seven Years in Tibet," Slow to begin, but don't worry -- it rolls !
","An editor may have been sorely needed during the first hour of the film, but if you made it 40 minutes in chances are you stayed. The scenery was breathtaking as were the costumes and the seeming authenticity of the setting. Once again Pitt tackles a role involving a foreign accent (of sorts) and does an admirable job; appearance-wise it certainly wasn't difficult to impersonate an Austrian skiier, but the sequence of the changes that took place within the persona of Heinrich Harrer over the years as the story unfolds was well portrayed. Even the uninformed will now know something about Tibet and its plight as both a nation and a people. The ethically and morally bankrupt political apparatus that depicts the ruin and exile of what's created before the viewer is stark, moving, and unforgettable. (Rating 4 stars of 5.)",8,1,2,18 January 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Johnny Depp & Tim Burton, both, at their very BEST !
","Thrilled from start to finish, I can certainly understand the rave reviews throughout much of Europe for the recently reinterpreted (and slightly renamed) 'Sleepy Hollow: The legend of the headless horseman' by Tim Burton and now featuring three-time collaborator 'par excellence' Johnny Depp who - as I have said before - is the most under-rated actor of his generation in Hollywood. Between this and the recent 'Ninth Gate', I find myself at odds as to which is Depp's very best performance, but viewers will find he just keeps getting better and better with time. How he continually escapes notice at awards time continues to amaze and cause no small amount of chagrin. The film is top-notch, I don't care what language you see it in, JUST GO SEE IT. Rating 5 stars (of five !), and with greatest pleasure. (Honourable mention to British veterain Michael Gambon and a very well-matched Christina Ricci, too!)",10,0,0,1 June 2000
Fargo," Never judge a 'book' by its cover !
","For a long time I was reluctant to see this film until I learned that it was a parody; at that point, knowing something of the story line, I happily went along.  The film gives us a good look at Steve Buscemi, but Frances McDormand simply IS the movie. Without this sweet, soft-spoken and quite pregnant protagonist with an accent all too germane for that part of the US (and well done, too !), this story would go nowhere in a hurry.  She is to this film what Gloria Stuart is to ''Titanic''.  It took a lot to win-out over the heavy-duty competition in ''Secrets & Lies'', but McDormand took home the Oscar (''Best Actress'').  Now, can she repeat it sometime? Buscemi has gone on to give us some super performances since.  Enjoy it while NOT taking the film too seriously (rating = 4 stars of 5).",8,0,0,8 January 1999
Armageddon," Finally a disaster movie with some class...!
","After surviving ''Deep Impact'' and ''Independence Day'' I was rather pleasantly surprised with this one.  Special effects were fabulous of course, there's no attempt at any kind of CIA/FBI  cover-up thrown at the viewer, and the bit of a history lesson at the beginning was a good way to kick-off.  Most pleasing however were the characters themselves (no offense Bruce, but this ain't true of your earlier works).  Bruce Willis is credible, likeable and believable (did I really say that?).  Ben Affleck and Liv Taylor make a great couple -- wouldn't be surprised to see them matched again somewhere -- and the rest of the crew are just plain everyday people trying to do a job.  It was really very well done where the characters are concerned -- even including the military that appeared like, uh, well, the military <grimace>.  (4 of 5 stars = rating)",8,1,1,10 December 1998
The Patriot," Major Oscar potential: Gibson's best & Isaacs a thriller!
","Many, on both sides of the Atlantic, were howling about the so-called 'baddie' in this unequalled work depicting the Revolutionary War in stark reality carrying neither an overemphasis on gore nor on foul language, long before it ever hit the screens, but the truth of the matter is that it takes REAL GUTS to play the baddie: the one character everyone just loves to hate! And in 'The Patriot', Gibson's character and up-and-coming star Jason Isaacs provide an unparalleled balance in which it seems one almost sees a flicker of his former self (not pleasingly, either) in the other.  We have almost a pair of Jungian 'shadow' figures, and the film would have listed very badly on its proverbial side had there not been some such measure of balance.  For Isaacs we're talking nothing less than an Oscar-calibre performance, while Gibson himself may finally see his name opposite an Oscar nomination in an acting category.  The number of fine 'character' actors in this film is also impressive, and new stand-outs Heath Ledger and Lisa Brenner certainly deserve honourable mentions -- indeed, the latter may even find herself with a nomination as well.  Certainly the best picture of the summer, if not for the year (it's already got my vote!), and other kudos would not be surprising at all in the directorial, screen-writing, cinematography, editing, and yes, 'Best Picture' categories.  A blockbuster film which also just happens to be GOOD (too!), 'The Patriot' is a MUST-SEE! Don't wait, do it now!  Rating: 5 stars (of five), and I'll gladly hand both Isaacs AND Gibson their statues.",10,0,2,18 August 2000
Pearl Harbor," Dramatic effects, almost deja-vu, but dialogue suffers...
","The 2001 version of 'Pearl Harbor' has much in common with another massive-budget film of recent years, 'Titanic'. Not that both involve ships, but both involve superior performances by supporting players while the headline stars fall far below their potential... In this film the recreation of the event itself is nothing short of phenomenal, to the point of momentary lapses and SHOCK... The visual effects defy imagination and, along with cinematography, possibly art direction, sound, and (certainly) the theme song, there are elements here I expect displayed at the next instalment of the Golden Globes, Oscars, BAFTAs, and others.  Among the supporting crew, Academy Award Winner John Voight, Ewen Bremner, Mako, Alec Baldwin, and -- let us not forget, Cuba Gooding Jr., inspire, leading us to laughs, tears, stone cold somber moments, and everything in between. The first, John Voight, was so believable that he could garner an award nomination himself.  The hoped-for romantic 'enhancement' was not, in and of itself, misplaced, as many media reviews have stated. Rather, it was poorly done and here I would recommend a complete script chapter re-write. In other words, these things DID happen (during that era) and it could have been handled. It wasn't, and the film suffers for it. Our leading three characters are basically 'good' throughout (but not great), apart from various moments during said element. All three, at one point or another, stumble miserably through it, with Josh Hartnett doing the best job at 'damage control'. Ben Affleck, for his part, LOOKS just like someone from the era -- stunningly so -- and thus a major success. He manages the exchanges reasonably well, too, to include non-verbals, but for said element. (Hartnett is a little less convincing, but the difference is marginal.) Both men, at this point, however, lose the edge ENTIRELY on sounding like the 1940s, and the effects on the viewer are nothing short of a jarring back to the present = NOT GOOD. With better editing, Kate Beckinsale could have 'saved the day', so-to-speak, on the romance as this was a chance for her to 'manage' the unplanned balancing act (witness how well it was handled in 'Castaway', for example), but alas... No.  I wish to emphasise that said element also had the potential to add to this film and unfortunately takes away instead, from an otherwise nearly-perfect production. What were the writers/ editors thinking...???A few chewy remarks about money, vis-a-vis reasoning for making decisions with the use of aircraft and naval fleets are more indicative of yesterday's newspaper, and mean that even the directorial staff has forgotten the times. I recommend a dose of old WW2 movies to refresh their memories. This 'snafu' alone, however, would have had no more impact than a slight, indiscernable mistake made by a figure skater at the Olympics, e.g. the judges might have marked a 5.8 rather than 5.9. But along with the jarring effect of the failed element just cited, well...My rating, however, rests with the sound, visual effects, music, song, cinematography and supporting cast, i.e. all of which and whom TAKE YOU THERE to the event itself and that is what I was looking for. This was also true with 'Titanic' which could not have been carried without veteran Gloria Stuart retelling 'her' story along with all of James Cameron's creations... For these criteria alone, rating = 5 stars (of 5; but with 1.5 point markdown if I include everything else).",9,0,0,11 August 2001
Saving Private Ryan," There was no 'good ole days' era in wartime !
","More than anything else, I believe that eliminating the above myth (ref: summary, above) was the thesis Spielberg was trying to communicate to the so-called ''allies'' and especially the American public.  When one looks at the attempt at glamour, beginning with TV shows that trivialised the so-called 'good war'' in the 1960s (e.g. ''Hogan's Heroes'', ''McCale's Navy''), not to mention a warehouse full of WW2 flicks where soldiers fought with clean uniforms on dirty beaches -- cranked into production beginning not long after the Japanese surrendered aboard ship with two nuclear holes where cities once sat -- one can certainly understand why Spielberg felt the need to bring home this long-overdue message.Oliver Stone and others have already reminded us of how horrible was Vietnam, and the DMZ on the Korean peninsula is a living reminder of that war, but WW2 remained glamourised until relatively recent times.  While the first 20 minutes of ''Saving Private Ryan'', following a brief but touching introduction, have received much ''press'' -- and indeed that stretch of film is quite an ordeal for the viewer having ANY level of sensitivity whatsoever to get through -- it is the remainder of the film that will convince you utterly that war of any kind is a useless waste.  Kudos go in abundance to Spielberg & Co. and one quickly envisages at least 6-7 Oscar nominations on the way, to include ''Best Actor'' (Tom Hanks -- who just keeps getting better and better with age), Spielberg for ''Best Director'', and the film itself for ''Best Picture''. Top rating (5 stars of 5) -- make that six!",10,0,0,8 January 1999
Good Will Hunting," Don't forget the value of a great public library system !
","It's hard to believe that in a single year so many outstanding and unforgettable films hit the box office, but 1997 was indeed such a year. In any other this film would have walked away with Oscars for ''Best Director'' and ''Best Picture'', but suffice it say I'm grateful that the team of B. Affleck & M. Damon won for their outstanding screenplay. Damon's ''Best Actor'' nod was also well deserved and the two partners worked in tandem to play up Damon while playing down an equally strong B. Affleck (the latter shows his outstanding potential in ''Armageddon''). Most difficult this must have been, for otherwise the characters of Robin Williams and Minnie Farmer, both of whom got Oscar nods and the former who finally took home a statue, would have been lost in the shuffle. This film and its story were pure talent from start to finish, totally original and a refreshing change. Underdog over spoiled yuppie -- that's my kind of film -- and one's got to be happy for Williams who finally bagged an Oscar. Top rating (5 stars of 5) !",10,1,4,30 September 2004
Moulin Rouge!," McGregor's Best; Kidman's Breakthrough; together FANTASTIC!
","For the first time in Calendar Year 2001, I walked out of a film and thought that maybe, just maybe, I had just seen 'Best Picture'...!With an opener like that where do I begin?  As noted with 'A Knight's Tale', we have a revisionist approach to a musical in order to animate an audience where period music would not, and yet this in and of itself, while an ingenious idea, cannot guarantee success. Except that in both the mentioned films, it worked... and fabulously so!Nicole Kidman went ignored after a hugely successful performance in 'Eyes Wide Shut' a film that would prove quasi-prophetic in at least one sense although few would know at the time. It seemed in fact that neither performance with husband Tom Cruise (Far and Away, 1992) would earn either member of the now severing couple the praise they deserved. Kidman of course came out the bigger loser, having starred in the interim opposite many a big name and with very little notice. This has now changed!  Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, far newer but improving rapidly, just slides right into this role as if he were born for it. They both do, and it may be the springboard both needed: story, art direction, music, sets, costumes, make-up, direction, and yes acting, not to mention the singing (!!!) will have this film well up on the awards platter at serving time. In addition to our two leads, outstanding supporting performances from John Leguizamo and Richard Roxburgh are thrilling, and this is one film where the entire cast could garner the Screen Actor's Guild award for Cast & Company as everyone involved in the unfolding of the story played a critical role, no matter how great or small. Add Best Soundtrack and possibly Best Song to the honours list and then you have it. A true masterpiece! To director Baz Luhrmann and fellow script co-writer Craig Pearce, 'Chapeau'!
A five star film not to be missed and an early favourite for Best Picture, buy your tickets and see it now! Rating 5 stars (of five), simply flawless...!",10,0,1,9 December 2001
Meet Joe Black," Everyone should have an angel like that !
","Haunting, relentless and unforgettable -- three terms that would certainly describe Death.  Then, add Brad Pitt in a green suit with necktie askew and voila!  After Hopkins' near seizure, there are a few moments early on during which one doesn't quite know where this film's going (e.g. how can Death be so dumb?!), but the comics do work and the story launches.  Once it does, it grabs your attention for the remainder of the film; you don't want it to end but you know it has to -- Death didn't stop over for nothing, after all. Add West Indian accents to Mr Pitt's repertoire and a sensuousness that remains beyond compare (as a couple Pitt & Forlani have got definite repeat-appeal).  Hopkins is great, as usual, and must never rest for the quantity of excellent films in which he's partaken over the past year. Would that we all go out on such a high note, with full understanding and our eyes wide-open. Superbly done -- go and see it! (Rating 4.5 stars of 5.)",9,0,0,25 January 1999
Titanic," Gloria Stuart's role makes the film what it is !
","Director James Cameron reportedly said he wanted a Hollywood veteran to play the role of Old Rose, whose character is aged 102 and a still-living survivor of the Titanic at the time of an undersea search.  And a veteran he found in Gloria Stuart, Hollywood star of the 1930s and 1940s, and 87 years of age when the film was shot.  Old Rose slowly tells her story and spins her way into the hearts of millions on every continent where this film has played.  Eleven Oscars this film took home among fourteen nominations garnered (and most were deserved), but the greatest among the three missing statues on Oscar night was Gloria Stuart's.  Without her this film was an f/x extravaganza with a serious lack of credibility.  Di Caprio and Winslet simply aren't Clark Gable & Vivian Leigh and probably won't grow up to approach anywhere even close to the likes of them, either.  Nevertheless, Cameron wanted a film that the world would remember and he got one -- that ship was as real as anything yet created out of thin air.  Loudest applause for him and the massive crew that made this film possible, and for Gloria Stuart who made the story credible.  Top rating (5 stars of 5) !",10,1,2,8 January 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," The best Dracula / vampire movie ever made !
","The concept, the cast, the reasonable adherence to the novel (net of a few surprise 'adds'), an unforgettable performance by Gary Oldman as The Man, and a heavy supporting cast all combined to make this a gripping movie of top-calibre from start to finish. Often horror movies sag in the middle or dwindle away towards the end, but not this one. Crowned with a haunting and surreal theme song performed by the equally unforgettable Annie Lennox, both movie (and the music video!) are worth having. Totally worthy of the three Oscars it won -- get it while you can! (Rating 4.5 stars of 5.)",9,0,0,15 January 1999
Blow," Johnny Depp shines to ever-brighter heights...!
","I am beginning to think there is NOTHING this young actor cannot do and do magnificently. The variety and range of roles handled by Johnny Depp maintains him as my pick for 'Most Under-Rated Actor in Hollywood'. The performance at hand of drugster George Jung is credible, tangible, believable, and ultimately tragic and sad, as surely was the life of the real man, still living supposedly behind bars. From youth barely out of his teens, to aging inmate with a paunch, Johnny Depp carries off the role magnificently and one is so left wishing that the real-life character could have confined himself to 'small-time' activities by late in this film, that it brings tears to ones eyes: a person of tremendous potential was wasted. Equally stunning is the look-alike for Columbian drug lord Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis) and an excellent supporting performance by Ray Liotta, not known for playing sentimental roles.Many may have eschewed this film over a perceived similarity to FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, but the two are separate and apart (and equally unique). The other work is a bit of a 'frenzy' for those not advance-prepared.As with THE MAN WHO CRIED, BEFORE NIGHT FALLS, and CHOCOLATE, this is a must-see film for Johnny Depp fans, despite the fact that in two of the just-mentioned films his roles are less than leads. No matter. What this actor can do with a mere look, a gesture, a glance, an expression, others would need whole paragraphs to accomplish -- where not whole pages -- in order to rival. Simply impressive, superb, and without equal: Johnny Depp has no parallel in his generation.The film's drawback is the remainder of the cast. It's weak. With exception of Jordi Molla (who coincidentally has acted with Javier Bardem of BEFORE NIGHT FALLS) as one of the two-timing partners, there is a serious weakness in casting. No matter. The players named carry the film. GO AND SEE IT. Rating 4 stars (on five).",8,0,0,5 September 2001
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," It'll take your breath away... Literally !
","The transition from the first of the Vampire Chronicles was at least a partial success.  Pitt is convincing as Louis and Dunst was an absolute surprise as Claudia!  Lesser marks for Cruise as the famous Lestat, but the overall performance wasn't bad.  Banderas is always good and was no disappointment here either, in the role of the mystical Armand.  Rhea rounds out the cast of ''bad'' vampires vs. ''good'', amid beautiful and at times stunning scenery, costumes, and fantastic music.  True to the novel (roughly speaking) minus a surprise ending.  Great theme song from Guns & Roses, to boot!  Nods from both Oscar and Golden Globe (especially for Dunst) were well deserved.  Buy the video, and don't count on a sequel.  (Rating 4 stars of 5.)",8,2,3,25 January 1999
Contact," This movie deserved more Oscar attention !
","A terrific film with a terrific story.  Breathtaking from start to finish, the intro to this movie could be the most outstanding one I've ever seen ! Sagan made science understandable for many and this somewhat science-fiction work is more science than fiction.  Foster turns in the performance of her career as far as I'm concerned, and I was at the end of my seat throughout the film.  McConaughey, while good, may be falling into the trap of typecasting (too often a lawyer or advocate) but is likeable. Rob Lowe, representing the ''Religious Reich'', is irritating enough to be believable (he seriously deserves better roles, though).  A ''must see'' film and one surprisingly downplayed at Oscar-time (a mistake the so-called ''academy'' often makes). Top rating (5 stars of 5).  If you missed it buy the video !",10,1,3,8 January 1999
