The Equalizer," Too long, too violent, no plot...
","I'll start with the positives.Great acting overall; Denzel, Chloe and I really liked Marton Csokas (who reminded me of a young Kevin Spacey.) The chemistry between Denzel and Marton was great and there were some really comic bits with Denzel dancing, handing out the money etc etc. I like Chloe Moretz and she really has grown up and grown into her roles.However, I didn't like her in this role she didn't suit the character of Russian abused prostitute. She was very, healthy looking, if you know what I mean. Just because she wears a few different wigs doesn't make me care about her. Even after she got hospitalised I didn't care for the character as there as noooo development. A flashback of how she got sent to America and wound up where she did would have been helpful. But, no we just see her at a Cafe, she swears and wears a pair of slutty shoes and BAM we are expected to know who she is.Another thing that annoyed me was the complete lack of motive. Denzel didn't have a real reason to do ANYTHING he did in the whole film. I understand he cared about this random prostitute (who's name he learned 10 minutes before defending her honor) but to brutally, and i mean BRUTALLY murder about 30 people because she got beaten up?! I mean fair play, beat up the 1 guy who did it because she's about 16 but going all the way to Moscow to kill some guy who doesn't even know your name? While he's showering?! Didn't make sense to me.Once again, the general lack of character development bothered me. They tried to make Denzel mysterious and it just seemed lazy and straight up boring. Who were the random couple he visited? Their names weren't even mentioned and they served no purpose other than to give a bit of random re-con on Marton's character. That then went on to serve no purpose...There was a glimpse of a revelation, random woman divulged into Denzel having previously faked his death or something along those lines but it was never discussed again. And there was a mention of another wife that had died that he promised to never do 'what he does' again for? And if he loved this wife so much why would he go all nail gun, sledgehammer, mirror shard, corkscrew CRAZY to BRUTALLY kill so many people to avenge some random girl getting beaten up? Surely the promise made to a dead wife is more important than some girl who isn't really your problem? It was far too violent. As an example, Liam Neeson's 'Taken' has just the right amount of violence, you know the people he comes across are dead without having to show a zoomed shot of a corkscrew lodged into their throat. Or nail guns piercing flesh, throats being slit open, barbed wire ripping through someone's neck, a drill into someone's spine. It was like a SAW movie?! I expected violence, I enjoy horror films but it was just ridiculous.The finale reminded me of Home Alone! Using all the home depot gadgets to beat the baddies! When I saw him heating up the doorknob I laughed at how much it reminded me of the Christmas hit. And then the violence x10000 started and it got boring QUICK.And then it went ON for another 20 minutes.Disappointed in you Denzel.",6,18,35,15 October 2014
