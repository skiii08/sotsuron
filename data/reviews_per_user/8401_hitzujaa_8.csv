First Man," A good movie without a caution of the Epilepsy.
","I must admire that 'First Man' is a remarkable one. The story telling is not too slow to be yawning, but is understandable. However, in the middle part, there are unexpectedly swapping between light and dark and light and dark and again and again and rapidly. I have no problem with that because I do not have the Epilesy. BUT! If someone who has such neural disorder, how can he/she deal with it? So, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE show audiences the warning or you could be responsible for someone's physical or psychological injury.",7,0,1,21 October 2018
The Equalizer," It glued me to my sofa; can't walk away even the nature's called.
","It is not a Run-of-the-mill (ROTM) action movie with ton of explosions and gun fires. It is one of a kind. Generally speaking, ROTM action movies always hurry to tell watchers who is a guy and his background, and also his motivation/reason of action. That is almost tell us everything. Then, nothing left is be explained, and he just shoots at everything that moves. On the other end of the spectrum, this movie tells us nothing ... oh, he is just an employee in Home Mart at Boston. Well, it seems that he enjoy his job but not his life. What's next? He might have something in his mind, or a ghost form the past, perhaps! The director (Antoine Fuqua) and writer (Richard Wenk) just know how not to be spoon-feeders.If Denzel Washington is white, he is very fit to Agent 47 role.I have got nothing else to say, but it is Must-watch film.",10,0,3,10 May 2017
A Star Is Born," The star was born in the music industry, and now, in the film industry.
","Actually, I am not a big fan of dramatic movies, but this 'A Star Is Born' is awesome. The director has done a ton of homeworks, perfectly. The story telling was not too slow and not too fast, which made audiences understand easily and caught them not to lose their theater seats, popcorns and mugs of pop-soda. The director knew that who must be the two lead characters in order to increase value to the film. Consequently, right decision is made. It was the crying-trigger at the end of the movie. This is not state-of-the-art in this day, but I assume that it consumed a river of audiences' tear and tissue papers. I heard rapid long sobbing.However, I could give only 9 stars to this film. I am feeling that an important thing was missing. Just one thing! It is about the star manager. The audiences perceived that he was rude to the two lead actors. Ultimately, He responded to the tragedy. After the tragedy, the movie is ended. I think the manager has to show some sorry feeling to what he done. If the movie show this part, it will be perfect.",9,1,2,17 October 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I don't know what genre it is.
","Tarantino's films are unique. How unique? You have to be a good listener to enjoy his movies. His films usually lost their points, or they never have their points. It seems like his movies' story are always bended into various unrelated directions. For this one, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, it looks like a documentary with drama that the story telling was comparable to a man who was lost in a forest. Thus, watching his films, you must be very patient.",4,2,19,16 May 2020
Reservoir Dogs," Waste of time listening to what they kept talking.
","I watched about 30 minutes, then I grabbed a remote and pressed an eject button. Why the characters have to talk too much like this? I have no idea that how Quentin Tarantino tell stories to audiences, but this is not suit me.",1,3,12,15 October 2018
Titanic," Annoying film
","It seems that most lead characters tried to show their spirits; the Titanic designer stood still looking at the pic and sacrificed his life, the captain returned to the wheel and also sacrificed his life, musicians kept playing while the ship was sinking, and so on.",2,4,10,30 January 2020
Arrival," The movie is twisted due to swapping of flashback and Dé·jà vu.
","Here comes another 'non-spoon-feeding' film. Traditionally saying, 'non-spoon-feeding' is great for viewers. However, when the movie leaves no a single clue, it is turned to be terrible instead of an art. This movie reminds me of Steven Spielberg's the Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Extra-Terrestrial objects/lifeforms arrived at our planet surface and they/it are/is looking for some humans who can easily communicate with. The aliens used music instrument for communication (How cool is that!!!). In this Arrival (2016), The heptapods are not ... so ... talkative, but they like to write instead. Anyways, their ships are similar to the monolith in '2001: A Space Odyssey' ... 'It's full of stars.'Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and Hawkeye ... oh, ehh ... Dr. Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) came to have a chat with heptapods. After that, the film was interrupted with flashbacks. It is not bad if there were only a few flashbacks, but there were a ton of flashbacks. Swapping again and again. You have to imagine that how fun a movie is if their have too much intermissions. No doubt if viewers have a bad mood. At last, they were not flashbacks at all, but Dé·jà vus instead. At this moment, a question is came, Dr. Banks saw a real future or it is just illusions that heptapods rendered in her brain, which is to persuade her. In conclusion, 'non-spoon-feeding' is good, but 'Clueless' makes thing worse.",3,5,9,11 May 2017
Godzilla," TOO DARK! AM I WATCHED BATMAN?
","I assumed that the computer graphic division of this studio was too lazy to render surreal graphics. Thus, they tried to make the film darker and darker, so audiences will not be able to scrutinize the whole CG.",5,0,1,1 November 2018
