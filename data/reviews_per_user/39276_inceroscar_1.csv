It," Wasn't what I expected it to be
","The movie was cool and all but it was more of a comedy to me than anything else..the way the kids talked to echo their was awesome had me rolling on the floor laughing at times. And wasn't too much of a fan of the animation , at times the camera was moving waaaaaay too much especially when all the kids make it down to the sewer towards the end and are fighting pennywise. Just didn't live up to its hype",5,1,1,8 September 2019
