Casablanca," great movie
","Casablanca is an absolutely amazing movie, the acting was top notch, the plot kept the movie interesting the entire time. The style of witty comedy and its political hints were great. Humphrey Bogart played his role very well.The plot of the movie was amazing there were points throughout the film where you might think that you know how the movie is going to end but it goes in another direction which makes you want to keep watching to see what actually happens. The high point in this film came at the end of the movie at the airport, it was something that you wanted to happen and it did so it made it that much better to see the outcome of it all. This movie is a must see for anyone who loves an amazing movie.",9,2,3,19 October 2012
Citizen Kane," Good movie
","If you have never seen this movie and don't know what the famous last word is for then this movie is an absolute treat because of how detailed and well crafted it is but all leads to such a simple answer that will either anger you for having to sit through the movie just for that or leave you overly satisfied by the way it turned out and may give you a new insight on what people actually appreciate and make them happy. Orson Wells directed and played the main role in this movie and he did a great job in both of his jobs. The movie was filmed very well the cinema-photographer did an outstanding job with the way he chose his angles, lighting, and his takes. So if you haven't seen this movie as of yet go and watch it.",7,0,1,19 October 2012
Apocalypse Now," great movie
","If there are war/drama movie fans out there this movie is a great one to see, it has all the elements that I personally look for in war/drama film; someone freaking out because they can't cope with the world they come back to after war, people getting ordered to do things that are wrong but the soldier has to follow the orders, large amounts of violence,and of course the mission being completed at a cost. The acting is great, the story line is also great. The director did an excellent job in emphasizing the dangers and brutalities of war, showing that it is not all fun and games people do die and get seriously hurt.",7,0,2,18 December 2012
The Graduate," great movie
","I really enjoyed watching this film, it probably entertains and keeps the attention of most teenage or young adult male who have some sort of fantasy at some point or another to do some of the things that happened in the movie with one of their parents friends or just someone that is older than they are. It was entertaining throughout the movie because it had a level of comedy that most people can relate to when they are faced with certain things. The ending was not how i wanted it to be in terms of as both of them drive away in the bus they look as though they might fear the consequences of what they did, I wanted them to be happy with their decision and have a happy ending with no remorse.",8,0,0,5 December 2012
Singin' in the Rain," mind equals blown
","This is one of the best if not the best film I ever seen, it has all the elements. Comedy, romance, and sadness. The dancing is top notch full of excitement and rhythm, the actors played their roles to perfection especially in the musical numbers. Cosmo's 'make em laugh' solo number was my personal favorite because it did what the title said; made me laugh. The singing in the rain is another one of my favorite dance numbers but overall I enjoyed all the dance numbers but those two are the top on my list. The plot was great it ended the way that everyone would want with the mean person not getting anything and it makes everyone happy. This musical is my favorite and if you haven't seen it as of yet go out and buy a copy , don't rent buy so you can watch it whenever you want.",10,0,2,7 November 2012
Psycho," good movie
",By watching the newer version of this movie first it didn't make seeing the original as good as it would of been if I had seen it first. The movie overall was great it had all the elements of a great thriller you didn't know who the real killer was until you got close to the end of the film. The plot was great the way the story unfolded was another strong point in the movie. The actors played their roles really well especially the killer his character was great because he was just nervous a the time but got defensive in an instant whenever his mother is involved which kept it really entertaining given the fact that you don't see the mother you only hear her. If you have a choice which movie to see first choose the first one because it will make you appreciate it a lot more than if you see the newer one first.,6,0,1,7 November 2012
