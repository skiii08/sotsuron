The King's Speech," Helping Bertie rule - how unconventional therapy helped a King in need.
","Some movies directly or indirectly try to suggest lessons from that past relevant for us today. Films set in times of war are particularly frequently meant to say to us 'Never Again' – although we rarely take any notice. Did Schindler's List stop genocide? No. Did 'Oh What a Lovely War' make Generals more sensitive to the privations of soldiers on the front? No. Did 'The Last King of Scotland' make us all ensure that no more mad tyrants rule African countries? No again. These are all fine films but if they had objectives beyond that of telling a rattling good story I would suggest that these objectives were not met. So when one commentator suggested that 'The Kings Speech' is a 'hymn to the royal ideal. An insidious anthem to the notion that nobility of birth and spirit are usually, if not always, linked'. The charge that 'The Kings Speech' is some sort of monarchist tract is frankly nonsense. Indeed it is at least arguable that the opposite is the case. It shows how close we were in a time of unimaginable national stress of having as a monarch a man of no moral principles, a dysfunctional personality and objectionable political views and social attitudes. Wallis Simpson saved us from that disaster and she and the equally hideous Duke of Windsor troubled us no more once brother Bertie reluctantly took the throne as King George VI. That's the problem with the hereditary principle – for every good egg like George VI or Elizabeth II there are madmen like George III or twits like Edward VIII.'The King's Speech' is about Bertie (Colin Firth) and in particular about the Achilles heel that nearly made him unfit to rule. The Duke of York, as he was as the film opens, was the 'spare' that King George V and Queen Mary produced in case there was a problem with the 'heir' (the Prince of Wales). He faffed around for a while getting married and having a couple of children and rather ineffectively standing in for the monarch from time to time. At the close of the Wembley exhibition in 1925 his serious stammering speech impediment was revealed to all and the realisation dawned that any sort of public speaking, especially on the new medium of the 'Wireless', would be torture for him. Long before his accession in 1936 Bertie and in particular his sparky, confident and determined wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) tried to find a way of curing the Duke's stammer. A series of quacks and incompetents did not help him at all before the Duchess discovered the Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Logue was unconventional in his approach demanding informality in address ('Lionel' and 'Bertie') and also that the treatment took place in his Harley Street rooms rather that the Duke's palace.It took a while for Logue's approach to work and for him to break down the barriers of class, position and nationality that divided him from the Duke. The Duke resisted hard at times and was clearly shocked at the Australian's informality and lack of deference. But gradually he became to see that the approach was working, that Logue was sincere and talented and that the possibility for him to live a normal public life in service if his country was emerging. The cataclysm of the abdication enhanced the urgency for him to be able to speak clearly, and live, to his people as King. The approach of War made this all the more imperative. Logue became King George's right hand, helped him hands on with his addresses to the nation – especially at the declaration of War in September 1939.'The Kings Speech' is a true story. It is not a paean to monarchy but simply a portrait of a man at a moment in time who was bereft because he could not do a simple thing that almost everyone else could do - put a series of sentences together without stammering. And it mattered. It is also a portrait of a brilliant, engaging and strong-minded man, Lionel Logue, who had the talent and the means to make a difference. The key role of Queen Elizabeth in Bonham Carter's slightly mischievous portrayal is also clear – although whether the (later) Queen Mother was then quite as sexy as she is portrayed I'm not sure! The remainder of the cast is also outstanding – including lovely cameos from Timothy Spall as Churchill and Derek Jacobi as the censorious Archbishop Lang. But this is, above all, Colin Firth's film. We knew from 'A Single Man' that Firth was a great deal more than a pretty face and with this performance he builds on the solid foundations of that film to create a moving, sensitive and utterly believable King in need. This is a portrait of a man at a moment in time dealt a hand which he has to play in the national interest. He is not, as some have suggested, defending the institution of the monarchy which despite the venality of his ghastly brother was not really in threat. Britain had been distracted over the abdication affair. There had also been the threat of Oswald Mosley's fascists – the battle of Cable Steer was only a couple of months before Bertie's accession as King. Times were unimaginably difficult and in a constitutional monarchy it was not the King's job to govern – but he could, and did, make a difference. This wonderful film shows how and why.",9,6,11,12 January 2011
The Sound of Music," Strong on songs and location and charm; weak on passion!
","That 'The Sound of Music' (SOM) is a greatly changed version of the true story of the Trapp Family Singers doesn't really matter much. It does not claim to be an accurate documentary  what it is is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's (R&H) finest musicals and like most of their work it has more to it than just the songs. From Oklahoma onwards R&H created a series of musical plays all of which had semi-hidden dark undercurrents. So whilst SOM is at times rather over sweet there is enough substance to the story to make it rather more than a good couple of hours of jolly escapism. Robert Wise's film version moves at a cracking pace until the rather long drawn out denouement after the Salzburg concert. The Nazis search for the family in the Abbey just goes on and on! SOM is a love story and some may find that the falling in love of the Captain and Maria really does not fire particularly well. I realize that this is a family movie (and one made in 1965) so we cannot expect too much overt passion  but neither Julie Andrews nor Christopher Plummer really convinces as a character suddenly consumed with romantic fervour! Their eventual embrace seems improbable and rather stagy. You certainly don't get the feeling that they are in a rush to rip one another's clothes off! Far sexier is the superb Eleanor Parker who not only looks fantastic as the Baroness but manages to convey a much earthier attraction for the Captain. Similarly Charmain Carr as Lisl ('Sixteen going on Seventeen') is actually very adult and appealing in her feelings for the telegram boy Rolf. Ms Carr was in fact twenty-two going on twenty-three when she performed the role and you fell that she could give some tips to Maria rather than the other way around!So although SOM is an unconvincing love story that does not seriously diminish its appeal as a movie. Julie Andrews is superb as the children's friend and the release from the straightjacket that she engineers for them is convincing. When she stands up to the Captain early on you feel that this is driven by a very genuine and almost innocent determination to set them free. There is no self-interest at play here - she does it because she thinks that it is right. Ms Andrews made SOM the year after Mary Poppins and frankly she continues the Mary Poppins character into Maria. Hence her performance works as the eccentric governess where it certainly does not as a portrayal of a young woman in love.You will want to see SOM because of the wonderful music and lyrics, the marvelous scenery in the location shots around Salzburg and the collective performance of the cast. The Oscars got it about right. Best picture, best direction, best editing, best music and best sound. But there were no actors Oscar's (although Julie Andrews and Peggy Wood were nominated) and, in truth, none of the individual performances is particularly worthy of much more than a special mention. No disrespect to Ms Andrews or Mr Plummer but the roles did really call for a bit more than they were able to give if we were to be convinced of the love that was supposed to be developing between them!",7,6,18,3 December 2004
Casablanca," A serendipitous masterpiece
","Casablanca is a perfect artistic creation. It is a film which cannot be improved upon and one that, more than 70 years on, still has the power to surprise, amaze and entertain. It is not, and was never I think meant to be, realistic. By this I mean not just that it is not a true story but that it could never conceivably have been seen to be. The broad canvas of the city of Casablanca in the early years of the Second World War is authentic but the story which unfolds, the characters and the detail is of course fiction. This in no way negates the legitimacy of the movie which is far deeper than just telling a story would be. In this respect it is very akin to a painting or a sonnet. A painting is constrained by the two- dimensional static format and a sonnet by the rules of verse. But that doesn't mean that powerful messages cannot be conveyed. So it is with Casablanca. This is a film about love, betrayal, honour, sacrifice, loyalty, friendship, man's capacity for evil as well as for goodness. It is about judgment, weakness, kindness, passion, greed, and how even the most venal power can be overcome with courage. Put like that it sounds a bit pious but, of course, it is not pious at all. It is exceptionally humorous at times. The constraint is imposed by the need to reduce complex human emotions to filmable moments. It is full of metaphors which help this along. 'As time goes by' is not a theme song but a symbol of times past not time present. Rick had forbidden Sam to play the song because it stirred too strongly the memories of his and Ilsa's time together in Paris. When Ilsa turns up in Casablanca she insists that Sam plays it and so signals her wish to return in some way to Rick. The playing of the Marseillaise in the bar to rebut the Germans is symbolic of the struggle between good and evil. It is a courageous and provocative thing to do. And it contrasts neatly with the character development of Rick and the police Chief Renault. Each of them has to be pragmatic to survive and they cheat, lie and deceive as part of this. But as we suspect from the start with Rick, and come to learn with Renault deep down these are good men. The means justifies the ends if those ends are honourable. Rick, like many great heroes (there is an intriguing parallel with Oskar Schindler here) has to be tough and do things he would prefer not to do. But when tested he comes up trumps. There is an illustrative sub plot with a young Bulgarian newly married couple who Rick helps to get exit visas to Lisbon, he doesn't need to do this and there are risks. But inspired by his inherent sense of decency he does it. Casablanca is a love story - or actually two. The one between Humphrey Bogart's Rick and Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa and the one between Ilsa and her husband Victor Lazslo. Bergman's performance is sensational. The close-ups show her astonishing beauty and make Rick's passion for her wholly credible. There is an intriguing moral sub plot about Ilsa and Rick's brief affair in Paris (shown in flashback). We learn that Lazslo was missing presumed dead when this happened. This reduces the adulterous nature of the liaison - maybe a nod to the moral precepts of Hollywood in 1942? We also learn that Ilsa's failure to escape Paris with Rick is because Viktor has turned up - something that Rick was unaware of. Casablanca is a highly moral film - ironically because few of the characters seem to have strong moral principles at all. But, as we have seen, this is artifice. Lazslo is a man of high moral attitudes with a track record to match. Ilsa supports him and loves him for this and when it comes to the crunch she chooses her husband over Rick. Though Rick himself makes this easy for her by insisting at the end that she fly off with Lazslo rather than stay in Casablanca with him. The greatness of Casablanca comes from the ménage a trois and from the colourful key supporting characters. It comes from the juxtaposition of good and evil all within the claustrophobic tight world of wartime Casablanca. It comes too from the tight, pacy direction and a clever evocation of time and place. The film is iconic with dialogue that has entered the vernacular 'Here's looking at you kid' 'This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship' 'round up the usual suspects.' 'We'll always have Paris' 'Play it Sam, play 'As Time Goes By'' 'Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.' But above all it comes from the characters and from their portrayal by a cast all at the top of their form.Movies unlike paintings or poems are collective endeavours. Assemble the right actors. Write a filmable script. Get a good Director. And yet, and yet. It isn't enough. Casablanca works because these basics are right. If is a masterpiece because, serendipitously, what is in part a random collection of elements somehow works as a whole. The whole far exceeds the sum of the parts.",9,0,1,27 June 2014
Pirate Radio," Richard Curtis's dramatic loss of form offends and disgusts
","I doubt that Richard Curtis has a bigger fan than me. His first big movie success, the original screenplay for Four Weddings and a Funeral, was original and outstanding – it is my favourite film of all time. I also hugely enjoyed Notting Hill and then Love Actually – a film that he also directed. Bridget Jones Diary, for which he wrote the screenplay of Helen Fielding's novel, was also pure Curtis and very enjoyable - as were his television scripts for Blackadder and the Vicar of Dibley. To me the strength of Curtis has been not only his talent for humorous writing and plotting but his willingness to tackle controversial subjects with a light but sure hand. Across his oeuvre there is homosexuality, class, race, disability, dementia, adultery, obesity, and plenty of licentiousness and lust. In that respect his work holds a mirror up to society and reflects back life's highs and lows, joys and disappointments and frustrations and satisfactions in a realistic way - with only the occasional exaggeration or use of poetic licence.The Boat that Rocked deals with a subject, Pirate Radio, and an era, the 'swinging sixties', that is surely ripe for social comedy and humorous treatment. Quite why Curtis has created such a turkey is difficult to fathom – given his outstanding track record. But turkey it is - not just Curtis's biggest creative and commercial failure by far but arguably one of the worst films ever made. The $50m+ budget and the galaxy of starts that Curtis managed to persuade to be involved including Bill Nighy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rhys Ifans, Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh, could not rescue a film that is ill-plotted, tritely written, self-indulgent, and worst of all very unfunny. The characters are mostly unbelievable and parodic – especially the cabinet minister Sir Allistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) whose portrayal goes way beyond satire. The treatment of women is offensive – they are just amoral sex objects for the pirate ship's disc jockeys. Whilst it is true that the real DJ's on the real pirate ships were borderline-certifiable eccentrics the fictional characters that Curtis has created are improbable as well as dysfunctional. Seymour Hoffman shows his class in the one performance that is in any way memorable – but the rest are just going through the motions.In Richard Curtis's previous body of work there was never any need to explain the jokes – the humour was never forced and the situations rarely went completely over-the-top (except, perhaps, Colin Frissell's silly but funny fantasy trip to Milwaukee in Love Actually!). In The Boat that Rocked the humour cannot be explained because it is either absent or so puerile that, for me anyway, it barely raised a smile - it is also, at times, irredeemably vulgar. I generally subscribe to the view that nothing should be off-limits to poke fun at – but the parody of the Dunkirk 'Little Ships' at the end of the film went a step too far for me. As Philip French in 'The Observer' put it 'Curtis has alighted on Dunkirk, a tragedy narrowly averted, which he reprises as mirthless, feelgood farce.' I don't understand how The Boat That Rocked could have happened. How Richard Curtis could have written such trash. How distinguished actors could have lowered their standards to appear in it. How the money men thought that it could be a success – and how I or anyone else could have allocated nearly two hours of our lives to watch such dross.",1,12,27,28 February 2010
About Time," Return to Curtisland - with mixed results
","Those of us who are partial to 'Curtisland' have had to wait ten years for the next instalment – 'Love Actually' (2003) was the last film in the genre. Curtisland is that corner of Middle England inhabited (mostly) by twenty-something upper-middle class people who live somewhat unreal lives mostly as a member of a group of bright (mostly) attractive (usually) louche (sometimes) and funny (consciously or unconsciously) friends. It first appeared in the 1994 hit film 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and again in 'Notting Hill' (1999) and 'Love Actually'. It also featured strongly in 'Bridget Jones Diary' (2001) and its successor Bridget Jones – The Edge of Reason (2004). The films of Curtisland are entertainment and often make us laugh out loud – at least the first three did. The main accusation thrown at Curtis is that the films are sentimental. Sentimentality is a pretty subjective concept. The American author Mitch Albom said 'Critics have a problem with sentimentality. Readers do not. I write for readers.' I don't know whether Richard Curtis would agree with this but I suspect that he might! And with Graham Greene who said that 'Sentimentality – that's what we call the sentiment we don't share.'Which brings me to 'About Time'. Yes it is an extremely sentimental film but the RomCom bit is actually fairly unsentimental and rather good. Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) , a ginger-headed Brit, falls for Mary (Rachel McAdams) , a seriously pretty American who falls for him. They get it together and get married and have babies. That to do this Tim has to use a facility to travel back in time (he gets in a dark cupboard and clenches his fists to do this) to earlier moments in his own life is endearing and allows for some amusingly restructured moments. Not least when he travels back to rescue Mary from a jerk of a boyfriend by ensuring that they don't even meet! The meeting, falling in love, marriage and baby-making of Tim and Mary happens fairly quickly – in a two hour film it occupies most of the first half hour and not much more. The film is a paean to parenthood. There are two equally sentimental aspects to this. The first is the relationship between Tim and his father (Bill Nighy). The second is the baby-making and delights of parenting that Tim and Mary share. Nighy, as ever, plays himself very well. He's the sort of father who doesn't effuse with touchy-feelyness. But gradually as the film progresses and as he brushes, losingly, with mortality he feels the need to tell his son he loves him (etc. etc.). Poor old Mum (nicely played by an under-used Lindsay Duncan) doesn't get much of a look in.But what of the parenting of Tim and Mary? This takes up a lot of screen time. Here they really do run the gamut of emotions from A to B. I cannot recall a film I've seen with so much gratuitous baby business in them. Now I must reveal a bias here. Baby stuff is a sentiment I certainly don't share. No doubt others in the packed cinemas that are watching 'About Time' around the world will not agree with me and Curtis is being very clever in giving this sentiment a free run. If we combine the Father/Son story and the Baby-making story together under the general 'paean to parenthood theme' this is, as I say, what most of the film is about. And if that's your thing you'll no doubt love it. I rather sank in my seat as it went on.Far better for me was the theme illustrated by some time travel moments of living as fully as possible every day. Tim sums it up: 'I try to live every day as if it were the final day of my extraordinary, ordinary life,' There is one excellent sequence when Tim goes through a day without laughing or smiling much. Too busy to notice as individuals the people around him. Then he decides to reprise the day with time travel and this time he makes an effort to relate.Surrounding the main characters in Curtisland there are always secondary characters who bumble through the film – often making one major comic turn along the way. In 'About Time' there is Tim's batty sister (as in Notting Hill) Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) who is rather more than batty actually and nearly dies as a result of a drunken car crash at one point. She is rescued by Tim and Mary because she is lovable really and just needs a good man, rather than a rat, to save her. The good man is another member of the Ginger Tribe (Tim is Ginger) Jay (Will Merrick) and in the end they have settled down together and they have a baby. No surprise there then! Then there is the role usually played by Rowan Atkinson of the strange eccentric. Tom Hollander got the part of the foul-mouthed boozy playwright Harry. I thought that this was a very funny portrayal – a man so unpleasant you feel he must have graduated with a PhD in nastiness.This is a two-hour film and is I would suggest at least half-an-hour too long. The story of the accident to Kit Kat just goes on and on – that's the trouble with time travel life tends to repeat itself. There are also some plot inconsistencies and tricks which make little sense. Would I recommend it – perhaps not if you aren't into babies and slushy father/son scenes. On the other hand Rachel McAdams is absolutely lovely as well as being a very good actor.If you think that you might 'share the sentiment' then go along to 'About Time'. If you think that you might not - but you go anyway – you might need to shut your eyes a bit at times!",4,9,30,24 September 2013
Closer," Discomforting and unreal, but compelling viewing
","I found this one of the most discomforting movies that I have seen for a long time. I revere Mike Nichols who has made some of the very best films of the last forty years. But Closer seemed in an alien style with dialogue and action that was unrealistic (maybe deliberately so) and a plot line that constantly made me want to say WHY? It is a film about lust and love without any actual sex scenes to speak of. That was quite smart of Nichols as it made us concentrate on the action and the screenplay rather than acting as voyeurs. I did not find the scene in the 'Mens Club' (or whatever it was) particularly shocking, but what was Alice actually doing there? Played by Natalie Portman she was so delectable that you couldn't really believe that she would pass her days as a pole dancer! Julia Roberts made a reasonably believable photographer and there was some depth in her performance. But she didn't actually look particularly good (sorry Julia)! The key scene of the film is the cyber-sex scene and I frankly found it repulsive. Was it believable that the two male leads (Jude Law and Clive Owen) would get their kicks in this way? Not to me it wasn't, but perhaps I've lived a sheltered life.Does the film seek to suggest that in the first decade of the 21st Century anything goes as far as relationships are concerned? That you can love (Dan says that he loves Alice) but still prowl and try and make it with someone you fancy within minutes of a meeting(Dan and Anna). I suppose that this may be the way of the modern world, but it is awfully cold and cynical and really loveless.I rather wish I had not seen Closer for all its technical excellence and even given the pretty good performances by the four leads. It was an unsettling film and it left me confused rather than entertained.",5,0,1,3 October 2005
Bridget Jones's Diary," Renee stars in a funny and entertaining film
",A delightful film which accurately and skilfully adapts Helen Fielding's unusual novel for the screen. Key to the film's success is Renee Zellweger who is truly outstanding as Bridget. I expect that a few eyebrows were raised when an American actress got the part of the quintessentially English heroine  but Ms Zellweger delivers a performance of such authenticity that you soon forget her Texan roots. It is not just her accent (accurate though that is) but she IS the epitome of a thirty-something English girl of modern times. She is Bridget Jones.As with most movies in which Richard Curtis is involved below the surface of the very funny script there are some quite serious undercurrents running. These include the fact that groups of friends are a source of strength when times are difficult. We saw this in 'Four Weddings' and 'Notting Hill' and we see it again here. Indeed some of the best moments involve Bridget's support group with James Callis particularly good as the gay faded pop star.Hugh Grant and Colin Firth bring to life the very different characters of Daniel Cleaver and Mark Darcy and there is a delightful cameo by James Faulkner as the predatory Uncle Geoffrey. But the best supporting performance is Jim Broadbent who believably portrays Bridget's father coping with the mid life crisis of his rather barmy wife.The soundtrack is also good  worth buying the album.,8,1,1,27 December 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Winning isn't everything -
","Amongst other things Little Miss Sunshine is a delicious satire on the Western (and especially American) cultural obsession with winning at all costs. The American dream says that you can be born in a log cabin with nothing and through your efforts become rich and famous  especially famous. The culture of celebrity and success is so powerful that it has created a complex tiered hierarchy of achievement and at every level there is competition. There have to be winners and losers. So at the beginning of the movie we have Richard's banal and cringe-making seminar on the 'Nine steps to winning' and we learn that for him the world is divided between winners and losers. Ghastly though this over-simplistic and shallow pitch is, those of us who have worked in the business world know that it isn't very far removed from the reality of much management training. There is always another snake oil salesman around the corner! A quick Google search finds 'Nine steps to building a winning sales organisation', 'Nine steps to better Telecoms service', 'Nine steps to managing change' and many more such magic solution guides! The trouble with Richard's programme is not that it is vacuous, but that he can't sell it  the book deal is elusive and he is on the point of bankruptcy. The teacher on 'winning' is about to become a loser.I have always thought that one of the reasons that soccer has never really taken off in the United Sates (unlike the rest of the world) is that soccer games can end in a draw (a tie) and that unless an artificial tie-breaker is introduced there does not have to be a winner in a soccer match. In all American sports winning is everything  as American Football Coach Vince Lombardi said 'If winning isn't everything why do they keep the score?' Well if you keep the score for the Hoover family then they don't come out too well. Richard is a business failure, Sheryl a divorcée, Dwayne hasn't spoken for nine months and is lost in Nietzsche, Grandpa is a foul-mouthed drug user, Frank a failed suicide  only seven-year-old Olive is an achiever. Victorious in the New Mexico 'Little Miss Sunshine' contest she now wants to go to the national final in California and the family decide to go together in their clapped out camper van. The events that take place on the road eventually bond this dysfunctional group of no hopers into a team  they work together at first because they have to, and then because they want to.When we eventually get to California and the full horror of the talent contest begins to be seen we view that horror through the eyes of the family. For the contestants' parents, the audience and (above all) the organisers they see is nothing wrong in dressing up little girls in adult clothes so that they all look like Barbie dolls each of who has a barely disguised, and wholly inappropriate, ersatz sexuality. That Olive is different and that, despite her family, she is a refreshingly normal child serves to show up the amoral hideousness of the 'winning is all' society  especially when it is applied to young children.The dichotomy between those like Richard who thinks that winning is everything and his father who is older and wiser is shown in their different approaches to Olive's wish to go to the contest. Richard says to her 'There is no sense in entering the contest if you don't think that you are going to win' but Grandpa says 'A real loser isn't someone who doesn't winit is someone so afraid of not winning they don't even try'. But the true winners in the story are not the individuals but the family unit. Their individual values, priorities and behaviour may be questionable but in the end they triumph in spite of this. As co-director Valerie Faris says the film is ' not about family values, but about the value of family'.",8,3,6,3 March 2007
Mamma Mia!," My my how can I resist it? Quite easily actually....
","As the last strains of Waterloo eventually faded away I was to stay in my comfy chair for quite a while numb and trying to bring back to life my facility for objective criticism. What can possibly be said about Mamma Mia other than to recall Lord Reith who once said 'He who prides himself on giving what he thinks the public wants is often creating a fictitious demand for low standards which he will then satisfy'. That this DVD is what the public wants is not in dispute.But will this truly abysmal film now create a run on of 'fictitious demand' as Hollywood rushes to copy it  well don't hold your breath.Of course objective criticism is a bit of a waste of time as those of us who think that good Cinema should at least be about films having a decent plot, well cast actors and decent production and direction may soon be in a minority. Those of us who suggest that on the evidence of the success of Mamma Mia that it is final proof of the maxim that nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the public are likely to be seen as elitist killjoys. Well so be it  I'm not going to dilute my crucial faculties just because the public votes with its feet and its money to crown Mamma Mia as worthwhile entertainment. Never mind the quality feel the width of the box office takings! But, for what its worth  and that's probably not much, here is a brief list of the reasons why Mamma Mia is such excreta. The plot is trivial, unbelievable, ill-constructed, offensive and just plain dull. The casting is dire. True Meryl Streep is wonderful  but when has she ever not been? But Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth are wooden throughout and they can't sing  and no this is not irony or even remotely funny. It's a MUSICAL. The leads must be able to sing. Doh! Amanda Seyfried can sing and she's very pretty too. But what about those bloody teeth? Sorry this may be a bit from left field but why would a nice little 20 year-old have to have shining white and 100% artificial looking brilliant white teeth. It made her look like an American Ryder Cup wife for goodness sake! Stellan Skarsgard (who?) was dull and he couldn't sing either. Julie Waters gave us one of her batty old ladies  we've seen it before Jules and it made no sense in Mamma bloody Mia. Christine Baranski was good  almost in the Streep class but surely a film with this budget could have cast all of the principals rather more thoughtfully? The editing was woeful as well. There seemed to be a good few gaffes that should have been edited out and reshot  did nobody care or not think that we'd notice when an actor forgets their lines? And was that set meant to look realistic  or the extras look like real people? Maybe not. And maybe on stage it wouldn't matter. But it wasn't on stage  it's a movie! Musical Theatre only really transfers well to film when it is opened out. Think 'Sound of Music' or 'Carousel' or 'My Fair Lady'. Mamma Mia was claustrophobic despite the stock shots of the Aegean. It looked more like Pinewood. It was Pinewood! OK so ABBA write catchy songs and we all like occasionally to hum along with them. But why put them into a stage show with a supposed plot in the first place. Why not just perform them as song and dance in concert? And if you must try and make a facile piece of drama around a random collection of songs and put it on stage then please don't later think that it will make a film. But you have  and a few rich people have become even richer as a result. And the Cinema is the poorer for it.",1,17,28,31 December 2008
The Theory of Everything," More things in heaven and earth...
","'There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'Hamlet's words tell of a world that will be beyond Horatio's understanding and implicitly also ours. That is the world of Stephen Hawking. There is a moment in 'The Theory of Everything' when Hawking's wife Jane attempts to explain her husband's theories by using vegetables on the dinner table as props. She does rather well. But for most of us 'A Brief History of Time' , and the rest of Hawking's work, will be almost completely incomprehensible. This movie is not, however, about his science or about his astonishing academic achievements or his genius. We rather take those for granted. In a way it is about something that is bigger than these things – the human spirit, courage, love, redemptionWhen in 1964, at the age of 22, Hawking was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease and given two years to live the prospects for him to make a lasting contribution in his academic field of study seemed remote. There would not be enough time. But for Hawking time does not always flow forward and he also manufactures it, not least in his own life. If you know that your own time is unnaturally limited then each day you are given becomes the more valuable. This is not just in respect of your work (academic study in Hawking's case) but in your personal and emotional life. And it is the latter which is the main theme of this astonishing film.Around the same time that Hawking's illness emerged he met Jane Wilde, a clever, pretty and engaging young history student at Cambridge. Their loving relationship and marriage is at the heart of 'The Theory of Everything'. They quite quickly had two children (a third was to follow later) and overcame difficulties that would have defeated most of us. For Hawking coping with his illness whilst continuing to produce leading-edge academic work became a courageous and determined obsession. For Jane there was never any doubt that she would commit herself to the extraordinarily difficult task of supporting her husband. This lasted more than twenty years before the combined stresses of his fame and the entrance of others into both their lives led to their parting. This story is told with great sensitivity and without sentimentality – and it is absolutely believable.The movie is a modern biopic in that it is as scrupulously authentic as the confines of a two hour movie covering more than fifty years of time allow it to be. It may be a brief and selective history of that time but it is faithful to its source material, Jane Hawking's book telling her story. The authenticity is enhanced by the quite brilliant performances of the two leads – both Oscar nominated. Eddie Redmayne's Hawking is an astonishing impersonation and it seems to capture everything of the man himself with unerring accuracy. He looks the part and conveys the energy, the drive and the humanity of the man, as well as the intellect, in such a way that he actually becomes him. Felicity Jones as Jane is no less remarkable. Here there is no need to try and do an accurate impression but an overriding need to convey her love and commitment, whilst not subsuming her character and personality to that of her extraordinary husband. For example as Hawking wrestles, quite mischievously I thought, with the implications of his evolving theories on the concept of God, she retains her faith and her solid Anglicanism. At no point is this a source of conflict between them.Like Horatio our own philosophy may not be able even to dream the things in heaven and earth that Stephen Hawking is able to cope with almost diffidently. But we can engage with the human story because it has references that we will all relate to. Love, loyalty, ambition, temptation, frustration among them – as well as the more mundane need to navigate safely through the journey of time past, present and future. At the end of the film the story is briefly replayed in reverse. We move back from Time Present to that moment in Time Past when Stephen and Jane first met. It seemed to say that the possibility of time travel may be something that science hasn't quite delivered yet. But in our minds and our memories we do make these journeys. And though physically we might struggle, though few as malignantly as Stephen Hawking has had to, if our minds remain alert we can still live profoundly satisfying lives full of achievement.",8,1,1,30 January 2015
Schindler's List," Faultless movie
","I am not really one for lists of the 'top ten' anything. Is Wizard of Oz a better film than Citizen Kane? How can you compare two such different movies? But it does seem to me that 'Schindler's List' is in a class of its own. More recent films like 'The Pianist' have tackled the same subject well, but nothing can quite compare with Steven Spielberg's triumphant presentation of Thomas Kenealy's great book. Perhaps the test of greatness is to answer some questions: Does the story matter?  Is it real (true) or believable?  Does it touch all the emotions?  Are there lessons to be learnt?  Are the performances strong?  Are the settings realistic and credible?  Are the characters true to life? (Heroes we can learn from; Villains we can comprehend)  Does the film have the capacity to change the way we look at the world?To me 'Schindler's List' scores more highly than any other film on all of these criteria. It is a truly great movie.",10,9,13,6 October 2005
Wimbledon," Dire and unbelievable dross, albeit with some good tennis scenes.
","About half-way through this facile film I turned to my wife and said 'Is this the worst film that you have ever seen?' She agreed that it was certainly one of the worst. Actually, to be fair, it did improve towards the end when the mushy Mills and Boon 'love story' gave way to some well-filmed tennis action. The Wimbledon matches, especially the final climax of the film, were rather well done and the quality of the tennis looked good to my (admittedly untutored) eye. But before that we were 'treated' to a sham of a film with unconvincing characters unconvincingly played and with a story line as banal as it was preposterous.Filming sport has always been problematic and there are few epics in the genre. Perhaps 'Chariots of Fire' and 'Rocky' and more recently 'Seabiscuit', but there aren't many others. One of the problems is that the joy of sport is that the unexpected tends to happen and that to create an artificial unexpected in a fictional movie plot can pale when compared with the original. In 'Wimbledon' a washed-out British tennis player gets inspiration from his encounter with a pretty young American. Quite why the makers of films like 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'; 'Notting Hill' and now 'Wimbledon' have to have upper middle class Brits of a certain age getting laid by worldly-wise American gals I'm not sure. Anyway the tried and tested story-line gets rolled out again this time. Paul Bettany is a 'Hugh Grant' figure par excellence (if they film Hugh's life story he could get the part, with a little hair dye) and his love interest Kirsten Dunst is sweet to look at. The speed with which she jumps into bed with Bettany might upset the Christian right, but it seems to help their tennis performances.The film's dialogue is cringe-making in the extreme. How actors as good as Richard Lindsay, Eleanor Bron and Celia Imrie got their mouths around this dross is wondrous. And quite what John McEnroe and Chrissie Evert agreed to be in it I've no idea (they would be well advised not to give up the day job). Just another pay day I suppose. I cared little for the precious central characters with their ghastly families and their spoilt brat lives. Having said that I did enjoy the tennis scenes and the denouement I found exciting. But in truth it is a pointless film and you would be well advised to find something better to do than to spend an hour and a half of your time sitting in front of this guff. Buy a ticket for the real Wimbledon maybe?",2,3,7,30 October 2005
The Graduate," A true 'Fin de siècle' story symbolising the end, and the beginning, of an era.
","I am the same age as Ben Braddock the Dustin Hoffman character in The Graduate so when it first came out in 1967 it was in every way a must see film. In those distant days (and despite the fame of the 60s as an era of free love) sex was rather less a matter of fact presence in your teenage years than it is today. So the older woman fantasy which Benjamin lives for real was one that most of us shared. Sadly I didn't find a Mrs Robinson to teach me and entertain me, but wish that I had! 'The Graduate' is a film about sex and love  but quite a lot else as well. It is a true 'Fin de siècle' story. The seductiveness and enticing allure of Anne Bancroft as the forty-something Mrs Robinson is quite brilliantly portrayed by this most excellent of actresses. She manages to separate love and sex in the same way that Benjamin does. At no point is there anything to their relationship except physical gratification  sex as recreation. When Ben tries briefly to develop something more ('Let's talk') he is rebuffed. Mrs Robinson enjoys Benjamin and he enjoys her  but deep down they have contempt for one another. Mrs Robinson also has contempt for her husband - a dull, dim, drone of a man whose marriage to Mrs Robinson only happened because he impregnated her. No love there either.For love we need to look at the character of Elaine Robinson  beautifully played by the young Katherine Ross. She is loved not only by Benjamin but also, and crucially, by her mother. In Mrs Robinson's sad and shallow life the only good thing is Elaine. So when Benjamin dates her and (almost) instantly hits it off with her Mrs Robinson is incandescently jealous. Benjamin, her toy boy, is going to desert her for her beloved daughter. It is not the loss of Benjamin as a stud that (one suspects) worries Mrs Robinson, but the loss of her daughter. There is always another potential lover available to replace Benjamin  but she only has one daughter.The Graduate is also a revealing satire on the getting and spending society of California in the 1960s. There is money galore for the likes of the Braddocks and the Robinsons and this can be easily converted into possessions. Mr Braddock lets his guests know that Ben's diving suit cost $200 ($1200 in today's money) and his and Mr Robinson's house are vulgarly ostentatious. Ben is struggling with this conspicuous consumption and can't really be bothered to launch himself onto the gravy train  he'd rather lie in the pool and have fun with Mrs Robinson. Very Californian! The soundtrack is quite superb  not just the great Paul Simon songs but also the Dave Grusin instrumental tracks. 'The Sounds of Silence' predates the film, but seems to be perfect for it. 'And the people bowed and prayed. To the neon god they made'. The 'neon god' is the god of money, consumption, pretension and the certainty that, as a parent or an older person, you have the right to control others. That certainty spurs Mrs Robinson to forbid Ben to see Elaine and spurs the two Robinsons to try and force Elaine into a loveless marriage with Carl Smith  principally to spite Benjamin. That ultimately Benjamin and Elaine escape together is symbolic of the growing confidence that those of us who were of the baby boomer generation had to break free. We were the first generation not to automatically follow our parents' writ.1968, the year after The Graduate appeared, was the pivotal year of the second half of the twentieth century. It was the year of the Prague spring, of the Tet offensive, of the famously photographed summary execution of a Viet Cong officer by Nguyen Ngoc Loan, of civil rights demonstrations across the USA, of Mai Lai, of the assassination of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, of 'Hair', of Humanae Vitae  and of Richard Nixon's election. 'The Graduate' can be seen both as the end of one era as well as the beginning of another. The era of conformity, formal clothing for university students, deferential regard for parents and so on disappeared as Benjamin Braddock and Elaine Robinson eventually did their own thing  as million of young people in the west began to do the same. I was one of those and I remember it well  it was fun, and, for me, a personal Mrs. Robinson might have made it perfect. But you can't have everything!",8,2,4,22 February 2007
Invictus," Sport as a metaphor for life on the largest of stages
","Whatever the problems of modern day South Africa, and there are plenty, the progress that the country has made in the twenty years since Nelson Mandela was released is pretty astonishing. A once pariah nation has taken its rightful place in the community of Nations - not least in sport with its hosting of the three main World Cup tournaments - Rugby, Cricket and Football. The first of these, the Rugby World Cup in 1995, was an act of faith on the part of the international Rugby Union authorities - it could have gone horribly wrong. 'Invictus' shows why it didn't - from an organisational and security aspect and, more parochially, from the perspective of the new 'Rainbow Nation' itself.The premise of the film is that the event was a success because of two men - Mandela himself and the South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar. The former extended the hand of friendship to his once bitter enemies in the rugby mad Afrikaner community. The latter, an Afrikaner himself, not only grabbed his President's offered hand but fought the institutionalised prejudice of his family, his team and his people to argue for the maximum co-operation with their country's first and greatest black leader. Mandela had not only his former jailers to deal with - he also had to persuade his own African people that retribution against the Afrikaners would be counter-productive. For example and well portrayed in the film, he had to convince them that it would be right to continue with the Springbok name and colours for the South African rugby team.Rugby, as shown in the movie, was a metaphor for the challenge South Africa faced post Apartheid. The game in the republic was exclusively white, elitist and predominantly Afrikaner. It was in many ways a symbol for oppression and separate development - the blacks had soccer on rough ground in the townships. The whites had rugby on manicured grass in great stadia in the cities. Rugby was played behind well-guarded gates of the elite schools. Soccer was played on any old piece of dirt. If the black majority was aware of rugby at all it was to cheer on whoever the Springboks were playing - better England than the hated racists of Afrikanerdom. Nelson Mandela knew that if he was to succeed with the highly sceptical white community post democracy, a community where he was still to many a 'terrorist', then he needed an ally. This is where Pienaar came in.Francois Pienaar had inherited, as Captain, a South African rugby team that was low on confidence and despite being the hosts was seen as having little chance in the 1995 World Cup. The media was highly sceptical of the team's prospects and the team itself was struggling to come to terms with the new world of South Africa. When asked to do some coaching in a township they dismissed it as a joke - and were openly contemptuous of the idea that the blacks could even play the game. Pienaar knew that the motor for change could be the charismatic President and Mandela genuinely moved him with his decency and lack of rancour about the past. Asked about his philosophy of leadership Pienaar said that it was 'by example' - on and off the field. Rather a Mandelan philosophy as well. This approach combined with some astute selections, including Chester Williams, the first black Springbok, meant that South Africa entered the tournament with a fighting chance. A win over favoured Australia in the opening match set the tone and the Springboks made it to the Final. Here they faced a New Zealand team who had eased effortlessly to the Final - not least because they had the awesome giant try-machine Jonah Lomu in their ranks.The match sequences in 'Invictus' are arguably the best ever seen in a movie about sport. Even the most knowledgeable rugby aficionado will find nothing to quarrel with about the portrayal of the matches - and the Final, which goes on for five minutes or more, is wonderfully portrayed. It was one of those matches where afterwards the cliché 'You couldn't make it up' was frequently used. Even though we know the result the tension is extraordinary and the moment when President Mandela appears in a Springbok shirt before the match is surely an iconic moment in history - and not just rugby history. South Africa's win with a drop goal in extra time seems now to be pre-ordained. But that is certainly not how it felt at the time! Whether there is some poetic licence in 'Invictus' I don't know - perhaps there is. But it has an authentic feel to it throughout from the portrayal of the interpersonal challenges that Mandela and Pienaar faced and overcame through to the match sequences it has the ring of truth about it. It is an uplifting film in every way with truly remarkable performances from Morgan Freeman as Mandela and Matt Damon as Pienaar. These two Americans, along with Director Clint Eastwood, might not know much about rugby, but they clearly knew someone who does. And they certainly know a great story when they see one - and they tell it with sensitivity, feeling and drama.",8,1,1,1 April 2011
The Holiday," A banal confection devoid of interest or merit
","This is a movie of such unremitting awfulness that the only reason for writing a review is to warn others not to waste more than two hours of their lives by watching it. A cast list which includes Jude Law, Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet promises much more than this travesty even begins to deliver. Their performances are wooden  nothing they can do can rescue a dire script and confused direction. It wasn't a low budget film  stars of this fame don't come cheap and nor does location shooting in Los Angeles as well as England. But every cent of this budget was wasted on a film that has to rate as one of the greatest turkeys of all time.There is one (just one) positive thing to say and that is that there is a delightful cameo by Eli Wallach as Arthur. An actor as experienced as him must have known that he was in a movie of no merit - but he had the presence of mind, and the presence, to act his far younger fellow actors off the set.The roots of this farrago lie are the genre of Richard Curtis - but in case you wondered whether writer/director Nancy Meyers has one percent of Cutis's way with words or ability to create a plot then the answer is clearly no. There are Curtisesque moments but whereas the love affairs in his films (Four Weddings, Notting Hill and Love Actually) are improbable they mostly become believable. The love affairs in The Holiday are as synthetic as the ill chosen soundtrack and the humdrum locations. Kate Winslet is too old to do Bridget Jones and Cameron Diaz needs to learn to whimper and emote less if she is ever to be convincing. The best line in the film is when a little girl calls her a 'Barbie'.When you think how all the money used up on 'The Holiday' could have been more wisely spent on half a dozen art house films that might make you think - if not make you weep. This is Hollywood at its absolute worst  a banal confection devoid of interest or merit  in the good old days it wouldn't even be a decent B movie.",1,4,9,17 November 2007
The Last King of Scotland," Power corrupts a mad leader, but also his young Scots doctor as well.
","'The British Empire is long dead; only flotsam and jetsam now remain' wrote Niall Ferguson in his outstanding history of Britain's imperial adventures 'Empire'. Amongst the flotsam and jetsam that had been discarded was the nation of Uganda which became independent in 1962 and fell into anarchy a few short years later. The first 'democratic' Prime Minister (on the Westminster model) was Milton Obote who soon tired of the constraints of democracy and overthrew the constitution. Uganda then became ruled by whichever warlord had the most military resources and from 1971 to 1979 this was the grotesque tyrant Idi Amin. Superficially a comic figure there was in reality nothing at all amusing about this maniacal psychopath. So to make a movie about Amin the minimum requirement is to ensure that his tyranny is clear  and this the director of 'The Last King of Scotland' Kevin Macdonald does exceptionally well. Amin could have been depicted merely as a comical Gilbert and Sullivan grotesque (which he was), but Macdonald - in his first feature film  uses his documentary-making experience to present Amin also as a far from fictional mass-murderer.Amin is revealed in all his horrendous authenticity by the creation of a fictional character in the young Scots doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) through whose eyes we see the dictator in all his raw brutal detail. Garrigan is seeking adventure and escape from the dull and straight-laced Presbyterian world of his family in Scotland. He chooses Uganda initially for commendable humanitarian reasons but is soon enticed by Amin's offer to him to be his personal physician. So we see Amin through Garrigan's eyes, and being as close to the despot as he needs to be to fulfil the role that Amin wants him to perform, we inevitably see Amin warts and all.'The Last King of Scotland' is about the corruption that always comes from power  not just the corruption of Amin, but the corruption of Garrigan as well. Gradually the privileges of power give Garrigan the conceit that he can do what he likes  just as his employer does. When this includes the idea that he can have a sexual relationship with Amin's attractive third wife Kay (beautifully played by Kerry Washington) his delusion is almost as mad as Amin's. It's probably never a good career move to screw the wife of a maniacal mass-murdering psychopath! Pretty much everything about 'the Last King' is excellent, a remarkable directorial debut by Macdonald. But what turns a very good film into a great one is the astonishing portrayal of Amin by Forest Whitaker. Whitaker is a veteran of some seventy movies as actor, producer or director but he can never have come close to a part before that was so made for him. And he took it very seriously indeed getting and staying in character even when the cameras were not running. It must have been very scary indeed for the crew and the rest of the cast to have Amin in their midst all the time!",8,3,4,8 February 2007
Music and Lyrics," Jolly, undemanding fare for a cold winter's night.
","If you want your movies to explore the meaning of life then 'Music and Lyrics' is not for you. It won't ever make anyone's top ten (or top hundred for that matter) but it does entertain and there are worse ways of spending a cold winter's evening than by watching this movie. Hugh Grant is good and believable as washed up 80's pop star Alex Fletcher and he sings his own numbers rather well! Grant can stroll effortlessly through a movie like this without breaking sweat and the part could have been written for him (perhaps it was?). Drew Barrymore is quirky and a bit weird as the tyro lyricist but she is engaging and funny. Revelation (for me) was the teenage Haley Bennett as the Madonna/Kylie/Britney 'diva'. She gives a convincing and very raunchy performance and hits rather well the vacuous self-aware style of these queens of pop. If you want more substantial fare then the works of Jean-Luc Godard, Michelangelo Antonioni and Federico Fellini are available on DVD. If you want an unchallenging and amusing couple of hours then this is for you.",6,0,0,10 November 2007
The Queen," Essential viewing for anyone who wants to understand the strange, dysfunctional British Royal Family.
","Stephen Frears' extraordinary movie 'The Queen' is essential viewing for anyone who wants to understand the strange, dysfunctional, detached, protected, snobbish and misguided responses of the British Royal Family at the time of the sudden death of Diana, Princess of Wales in August 1997. That the Queen, after too many days of aloof disdain behind the fences of her remote Balmoral estate, eventually understood the mood of the people was in no small measure due to the persistence of her new Prime Minister Tony Blair. This was the honeymoon period of Blair and he was sure-footed in his reaction to the loss of the woman he dubbed the 'People's Princess' and his wish that the Queen should come back to London to lead the nation's mourning eventually prevailed.Peter Morgan's script and Stephen Frears' direction are as realistic as possible and some parts of the film are semi-documentary in style. The dialogue between the characters, both in the Queen's immediate family and in the rival court of Mr Blair is, of course, invented but it all carries the firm ring of truth. It will be a shock to the royalist to see just how awful some of the Royal Family could be  the snobbish and insensitive Queen Mother, the bad tempered and dismissive Duke of Edinburgh and the diffident Prince Charles are chillingly well portrayed. Helen Mirren's performance as the Queen is truly astonishing to such an extent that very soon into the movie you forget that this is an actor playing a role and firmly believe that you are seeing Queen Elizabeth herself. Mirren does not impersonate the Queen - she is 'The Queen'!The film is more than a believable record of a week in the lives of the Royals and of the Prime Minister  it makes some telling points about modern Britain  the country that had just given the Labour Party a stunning victory after eighteen years of rule by the Conservatives. This is a Britain whose people are not prepared to accept what they see as inappropriate behaviour by anybody  even their Monarch. When the Queen acted so ill-advisedly the people told her so. It is also a Britain confident enough to choose its own icons and quite obviously it preferred the real and fallible Diana to the stiff and remote royal family. This remoteness was well captured in the movie by Frears' clever use of the stalking of a stag as a metaphor. The hunting down of a beautiful wild animal is shocking not only because most of the British people would find the violent act an obscenity in itself, but also because the fact that many of the royals clearly enjoyed the 'sport' showed how removed from ordinary life and values they were. Whether Stephen Frears also meant the hunting of the stag to be symbolic of the hunting down of Diana I'm not sure  but the senseless death of the animal seemed to move the Queen, and Mirren's performance at this moment allowed us to glimpse a more sensitive individual beneath her stiff upper lip external persona. One is reminded of Oscar Wilde's 'Yet each man kills the thing he loves' in respect of both Diana and the Stag.Diana's death was a learning experience for the Royal Family, but also for Tony Blair. He had to tread a difficult line between those in his immediate entourage with Republican leanings - who wanted to hang the Queen out to dry - and the reality of the British constitution which has the Queen, not the Prime Minister, as head of State. He did this well and listened more to the pragmatic and scheming Alastair Campbell than he did to his more strident wife Cherie. Blair's sure touch was eventually to desert him with his disastrous decision to support the United States over Iraq and one of the incidental aspects of 'The Queen' is the reminder that it gives us of how much we lost when this skillful politician made such a ruinous error of judgement.'The Queen' is a serious film, but it is made with a lightness and sureness of touch which means that it entertains as well as informs. And in Helen Mirren's sympathetic but never obsequious portrayal of the monarch we can see what must surely be an Oscar winning performance.",8,1,4,15 November 2006
Casino Royale," Vile and violent - a sad reflection on the public's taste in the 21st century.
","I confess to have only been able to watch the first twenty-five minutes of this movie before I walked out in disgust. If you like gratuitous violence, incomprehensible plotting, comic book characters and the full gamut of action movie clichés then Casino Royale is for you. The film has been superbly marketed and will no doubt pander brilliantly to the facile tastes of those that think that murder and mayhem is fun, and who want to suspend reality. I am sure that the film will be a huge commercial success. But I found it vile and a deeply saddening refection of what is the public's taste in the 21st Century.Does it matter that the world's twelve-year-olds will be going in large numbers to see this trivial little film? I think that it does as at least a few of them will think that this farrago bears some resemblance to reality - I wonder how they will respond in how they live their lives? Hardly peacefully!",1,8,14,14 December 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Whatever you choose in life it will be a compromise
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a hugely entertaining and pleasingly unpretentious film. Woody Allen has always directed female actors particularly well and he gets stunning performances from Rebecca Hall (Vicky), Scarlett Johansson (Cristina) and Penelope Cruz (Maria Elena). The fourth member of the ménage à quatre, Javier Bardem as the Catalan artist Juan Antonio, is also very good indeed, as is the supporting cast.The film could have been pretentious and offensive twaddle in less assured hands than Allen's. Two beautiful young American women on holiday in Spain falling for the same mature Latin lover doesn't sound very original or engaging. But the contrast between the two young women is nicely drawn and rings true and the location shooting and the naturalistic dialogue adds to the authenticity of the story. The shock to the plot when Penelope's Cruz's Maria Elena storms in is at once both hilarious and frightening - but also convincing.Allen has an amusing gentle dig at self-satisfied middle-class America with his depiction of the dull as ditchwater Doug - Vicky's fiancé (Chris Messina). I knew that I was going to hate him when I heard him call Vicky 'Babe' - and I wasn't disappointed. As the movie unfolds the key question is whether Vicky will choose dull old Doug or exciting firebrand Juan Antonio as her partner. The former choice would almost certainly be for life - the latter probably not! When Woody Allen is at his best - and this film is very close to being in that category - it is satisfying and cerebral entertainment. The characters are not from a comic book but from real life and whilst a degree of poetic licence in the plot is necessary to move the story along it is never incredible. And as audience members we will empathise with the characters in a way that is much less possible in a more traditional Hollywood movie. We care about what happens to Vicky and Cristina because we like them and understand their dilemmas. They are serious and bright and attractive and real.Is there a deeper meaning to Vicky Cristina Barcelona than, just, the romance and the charm? Is it in any way a 'message' movie? I think that to some degree it is - and that the message is to consider living every day with the thought somewhere in your mind that it might be your last - Juan Antonio says as much at one point. And, of course, it is also about the luxury of choice. To choose between alternative lifestyles, alternative partners, alternative compromises. Each choice is a compromise to some degree because perfection is not just elusive it is impossible - the question is how far short of the ideal will you have to settle for?",8,1,3,15 May 2010
Green Book," Authentic depiction of the North/South, Black/White and educated/not educated divides of the 'Land of the Free'
","The myth that the victory of the Union in the Civil War freed the African-American is punctured in this extraordinary movie which does not duck one issue about the continued post Civil War divisions - even well into the second half of the 20th Century.The 'Green Book' is a travel guide which listed the places where negroes were permitted to overnight. Especially in the South. In 1962. A hundred plus years on from Lincoln. As in 'The Heat of the Night' if you venture south of the Mason-Dixon Line you'll find a foreign country where they do things differently.Don Shirley, the black pianist, and Tony Lip, the Italian from the Bronx who is his driver, defy the black/white stereotypes. The former is sophisticated, supremely talented, squeamish and refined. But black. The latter is rough, lives from hand to mouth, physical and limited. But white. In Birmingham Alabama Tony can eat in the restaurant and piss in the bathroom. Don has to go down the street to somewhere the black folks eat and piss in a shack in the yard.That's the essence of the story. Prejudice. Racial divides. Discrimination. Overt and largely unchallenged racism. Even to a genius who lives in a beautiful apartment on the top floor of Carnegie Hall. The 'Boy' has to telephone Attorney General Bobby Kennedy to get released from jail where an indiscretion of Tony has landed him.The film is impeccably directed, brilliantly cast and cleverly written. It is fictionalised from the true story of Don and Tony but this is not a documentary. In 2019 in the Age of Trump it is appropriate to revisit the recent past of explicit prejudice ( and worse). America is rotten fro the bottom up - 'Green Book' tells you why.",9,0,2,13 October 2019
Atonement," Brilliant film illuminates McEwan's fine novel
","Ian McEwan's novel was an astonishing achievement and both its structure and storyline presented difficulties for anyone who wanted to bring it to the screen. Joe Wright (Director) and Christopher Hampton (screenplay) have surmounted these difficulties with aplomb and produced a film which is not only 100% true to the original but which is a moving and creative work of art in its own right. The story is in three distinct parts. The first is about the tensions between two sisters and with a handsome young man - who is suitor to the elder - in an upper-middle class English family in 1935. There is an undercurrent of unease in this story - and when the climax comes it is no surprise. Passions, mendacity, jealousy, snobbery and ultimately violence bubble inexorably to the surface. The second part describes how the grievously hard-done-by young man from the first story gets caught up in the retreat to Dunkirk in 1940. This is harrowingly complete and horrifically graphic in its gory detail. The third part shows how the now adult younger sister copes with her guilt in the aftermath of the tragedy of 1935 and also with her determined effort to atone, partly by training as a nurse in a military hospital. A gripping plot, brilliant writing and fine characterisations illuminate this movie  excellent performances both by both the principals and the supporting cast.Atonement is really a three-hander. The elder sister is played with great subtlety and distinction by Keira Knightly  perhaps here finest screen performance to date. Her suitor, Robbie, is brought to life by James McAvoy who is quite outstanding in the war scenes. And the younger sister, Briony, is believably played as a child by Saoirse Ronan, and thoughtfully by Romola Garai as an 18-year-old. There is also a stunning cameo from Vanessa Redgrave as the 77-year-old Briony at the end of the film. The five minutes when Ms Redgrave is on screen is a small master class in acting that all drama students should study carefully! The cinematography is excellent throughout  especially the recreation of Dunkirk which is done absolutely without an ounce of sentimentality (as it should be). No small boats and brave Brits escaping to freedom here  just blood, sweat and tears. The same applies to the hospital scenes which might not be suitable for those with a weak stomach. But it certainly tells it as it was.Finally it is worth recording that a minor subtext of McEwan's book is about the art of writing fiction  particularly about the writing of a realistic novel which is closely linked to real-life events. I wondered whether this would be tackled in the film, but it is and it works very well. For those who have seen the film but not read the book I heartily recommend McEwan's novel to you. They complement one another well and you are likely to be moved all over again when you turn the pages.",9,0,1,10 February 2008
