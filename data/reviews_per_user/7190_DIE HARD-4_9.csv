The Rock," So bad !
","If you like to watch unintelligent movies that you've already seen a million times, then this one is perfect for you. Sure, it's fast paced and well made, but it's too much of nothing. I really love action films, but this is the type of movie that makes my brain melt. Avoid it !",Null,6,24,3 July 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Disappointing and pointless
","'The Blair Witch Project' only proves one thing ! And that is that you can have an enormously successfull movie, without the movie being any good at all. As If we didn't know that already !!'B.W.P.' doesn't have a script. It's just filled with uninteresting trivial stuff that you don't really care to watch at the movies.The only good thing about this film is that it makes me wanna grab a VHS camera and go out and shout a full length film by myself. Because whatever I'd do, it couldn't end up worse than 'B.W.P.'.This might be a spoiler, so if you haven't seen the film, and still want to see it despite my warning, then you shouldn't read any further : Am I the only one who thinks that the characters in 'B.W.P.' are complete idiots ! Despite everything that happens to them, they keep on filming... That's not logical, and it's far from the human nature. The only natural reaction to the events depicted in the movie would be to throw the camera's the hell away, and to do whatever one can to save ones own butt. Not to keep on filming !!Avoid this one !!",Null,2,3,21 October 1999
Memento," Fantastic!! =)
","I saw this film almost by chance when I was on vacation in Spain. I had never heard of it, and that's why I decided to see it. And I'm glad I did. Very glad!This is a fantastic film! Original, intelligent, funny, interesting... and the list goes on and on... This is definatly a must see, and if you miss it, then it's your loss...GO SEE IT NOW!! =)",Null,0,0,25 March 2001
X-Men," Made my ass hurt!!
","This film made my butt hurt!?!!? Sometimes you can sit through a three hour movie, and it keeps you captivated all the way through, not giving you a reason to think about your sitting position in the theater seat. Even though 'X-Men' is about ninety minutes long, it's really slow, and it made me think about how I was sitting, and therefore it made my butt hurt. So now you know that!!But 'X-Men' is not just a pain in the a**, it's quite good, but not a must see.The trailer for 'X-Men' promises an action packed movie, as trailers often do. But 'X-Men' is more of a character film, even though the characters are not that deep. So I guess this movie would be more fun for readers of the comic book, to whom I don't belong.Anyway, I was hoping for action a la 'The Matrix'. And surely director Bryan Singer has been inspired a little by 'The Matrix'. One of the female characters makes a sideways flip in the air, and I think that shot even has the same camera angle as in the otherwise same shot in 'The Matrix'. This is the kind of stealing that film makers call homage. But to Bryan Singer's defense, I would like to say that he has already proven to me that he has a good visual sense, in 'The Usual Suspects'.The problem with 'X-Men' is that the action scenes are few and far between, even though they are visually stunning. Other than that the film has some cute scenes making it all worthwhile in the end.I also have to add, that this is Newton Thomas Siegel's (Director of photography) best work yet.",Null,6,13,24 July 2000
Being John Malkovich," Unique yes, but not sympathetic at all!!
","Everyone seems to love this film, because it's so unique and bizarre! And sure it has it's fun and interesting parts, but as a hole it's almost disgusting! The characters are so stupid and selfish and unsympathetic, that I got p***ed off!Another thing I didn't like is: that films like this usually have something to say, about life, or relationships, or whatever. But 'Being John Malkovich' doesn't tell us anything at all. It's just a pointless film that lives on it's unique ideas - which I'm sure the film makers were in love with. But for me it wasn't enough! Far from it!This film also made me wonder if John Malkovich is as unsympathetic in real life, as he was in the film, since he played himself.Also the ending is too bizarre, and just sooo bad! You won't lose any night sleep if you skip this one!!",Null,3,7,31 August 2000
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Eh, excuse me !!
","Ah please, what is this ?!?! Writer/Director Guy Ritchie apparently likes Tarantino movies, and with 'Lock, Stock...' he wanted to make his own cool movie, with a lot of cool plot twists. Unfortunately he fails to do so. And he fails miserably. There are so many twists and turns in this stupid movie that it just made me wanna stand up and shout, out of misery. I mean after seventy nine turns in the script it's really not that cool any more. And it also feels like Ritchie has put in these twists, just to have more plot twists than any other movie in the history of film making.This is truly a wanna be movie, because the entire thing is made out of parts of other movies, most notably of 'True Romance'. The cinematography is also really poor. There are a lot of annoyingly over exposed scenes, that just look cheap.I have friends who liked this movie. But I'm still shaking my head in disbelief over what I saw more than two months ago.UGH !!!!",Null,33,71,12 June 1999
Die Hard," One of the best movies I've ever seen !!
","For a little over two hours you won't have a chance to catch your breath. When I saw it the first time I left the theatre all sweaty, and I had that feeling you have after you've experienced something great and unique, and you're aware of it. Need I say more ? If I do, then check out my IMDb user name !Don't forget to check out 'Die Hard 2' as well. It's nearly as good as the original. Unfortunately though, 'Die Hard with a vengeance' is crap, so you better not waste money on that one.",Null,0,1,27 May 1999
When Harry Met Sally...," Best love story ever made
","This is a wonderful film !!I think most love stories on film are more or less crap, because everything is so refined in them, that one end up not being able to identify oneselves feelings and actions - when in love - with the ones of the characters - supposedly in love.'When Harry Met Sally' is an honest and straight forward film about love, and therefore completely believable.I highly recommend this little masterpiece. I LOVE IT !!",Null,0,1,19 October 1999
True Romance," Goodie !!
","If you've seen 'True Romance' then I don't have to tell you what it's about. If you haven't seen it, I don't wanna spoil anything for you. I just want to make sure you don't miss it.So here are a few reason why you shouldn't miss it:Tony Scott (director) Great action director. Has made many fast paced, strong, exciting, and action packed films, like Crimson Tide, Enemy Of The State, Beverly Hills Cop 2 etc.Quentin Tarantino (writer) Comments seem unnecessary.Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L. Jackson (actors) Who could fail with a wonderful cast like this ?Yep, that's all folks ! except: rating: 10/10",Null,1,2,25 June 1999
