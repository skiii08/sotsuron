First Man," Depressing and boring
","We have heard a lot about the moon landings, and in particular about Apollo 11. I cannot know the exact sentiment of the actual guys involved, but according to this movie it all seemed a momentous drag. No joy, no excitement, no enthusiasm - just a bunch of boring and lethargic introverts dragged into the tedious task of landing on the moon. Not exactly the impression we usually get of test pilots and astronauts. I somehow doubt that it was all that drawn out and excruciating. In fact, I was always under the impression that these guys knew they were extremely privileged to be the chosen ones and were quite excited about the whole thing. In any case, it's a horribly boring movie.",2,5,8,25 January 2019
Alien: Covenant," An absolute abomination
","Has everyone gone absolutely nuts? Why would Ridley Scott put his name to something like this? All these remakes/sequels seem to indicate that no one can write a story anymore, or at least that no one in the film industry cares. Given the number of awesome books readily available, why would anyone create an Alien sequel written by idiots. The Alien franchise has a massive potential, and yet Ridley produces drivel like this. Beats me. Maybe there is too much lead in the water or something. What an incoherent, boring to the extreme piece of amateurish crap. Save your money!",2,7,15,3 June 2017
