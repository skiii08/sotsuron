Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'This' made your top 250???!!!
","The fact that 30% of voters registered this film 10/10 worries me.  As a completely unimpressed party, I would really like to know why?It wasn't terrible but it also wasn't very good.It's acting; storyline and dialogue left me restless in my seat after a mere half-hour. Those that raved about this film must have such blind faith in the past three films, that they would have enjoyed a film of Luke Skywalker finishing a crossword puzzle.Am I being overly harsh about this film as an adverse reaction to the religious following it is receiving? Maybe - but there aren't many unbiased opinions around.There were a few small redeeming qualities: The special effects were good; some of the shots were very interesting and Liam Neeson was streets above his co-actors.All in all the only real interest in the film are the connotations to the preceding movies. which I suppose is what it's all about.Take away the Star Wars from this film and it goes straight to video.",3,0,1,5 September 1999
Snatch," Not the Pulp Fiction sequel we had hoped for.
","Expectations were high, I'd loved Lock Stock and was eagerly waiting to see if Guy Richie could do better 2nd time round when thrown a bit of money - ala Quentin Tarentino. To answer simply: no he couldn't.Snatch is a good, slick film but it lacks something. Maybe it's originality? Very similar to Lock Stock - different storylines weave and turn crossing each other's paths in unexpected twists, but this time maybe we're expecting them?It lacks flow, it tends to stop and start. We end up talking about the 'good' bits instead of the film as a whole.The direction is good, Brad Pitt is excellent [it hurts me to say], the soundtrack is definitely worth buying and the majority of the acting is very good.Snatch [7/10] is definitely worth seeing but know you're pretty much getting more of the same... and if you haven't seen Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels yet see that instead!",Null,1,2,28 August 2000
