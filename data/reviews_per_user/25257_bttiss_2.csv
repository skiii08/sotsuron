Scarface," a must see for anyone
","Well what can I say, well I've seen this film 12 times and I still enjoy The film, it's arguably long but that doesn't bother me and I just love The one liner's in it- even for today's films, I think it still hold up- it's a lot Better than some of the films out now by milesI've never really understood why people don't like the shower scene, its Not like you see anything- the violence is never physically seen for that Scene (so why all the hysteria)Anyway I love everything about it and it one of my no 1 gangster films And it's Al Pachino at his best (for gangster films that is) and I supposed The only films that come close to as good as this (in terms of gangster Films) would be Godfather and Once Upon A Time in AmericaWould somebody in the film industry wise up and realize that they need To make films that draws these types of great films into their ideas for Future Hollywood films or anywhere else in the world, I miss films With story weather than these weak non-narrative gangster films where People kill one another for no reasonThe only contemporary film that cover this similar genre and gets it Close to the classic 70s and 80s films would be Lucky Number SlevenI'm probably wrong, and all my info is probably bull, but just like all Comments posted on IMDb it's all a matter of opinion and I understand That people will disagree with the information and my viewsAnyway got sidetracked there, as I was saying this films got class style And mint cast, cinema photography and atmosphere that cemetery films Are lackingStory 10/10 cinema photography 9/10 cast 10/10 director 10/10",10,0,1,4 January 2007
Saw III," this film feels more like saw 1 than saw 2 did
","the overall film was amazing to watch, particularly the operation scene where they open up jigsaws head to relieve pressure to his brain, the drilling is particularly creepy and hurt my ears too (a bit too loud for me) but then again i saw it in the cinema. anyway the overall film is great and feels like the first saw but more elaborate. the only flaw (if you can call it a flaw) in it would have to be jigsaw dying, not his actual death but the fact Jeff tries to save everyone, but when it comes to jigsaw he cant let go of the fact he 'voilated' his wife and yet all this pent up anger of the jury, etc seems to rub off like nothing,eventually. the best twist in the film was that adam didn't die of starvation, but was actually killed by amanda (she put a bag over his head) overall i would have to say that this film isn't as bad as a lot of people have said (not naming anyone like) and i genually cant believe that people went to the cinema to see saw 3 when they hadn't seen the other two. IT'S A FILM Purely FOR THE FANS!!!!!!!!!",8,1,1,30 November 2006
