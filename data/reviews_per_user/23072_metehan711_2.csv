The Expendables 2," Don't worry if you didn't like the movie
","As a person who believes that this sequel isn't as good as the first movie, I observe that most people who didn't like it were reluctant to express their views openly as some people praised this film (often to the detriment of the first). Don't be! And here is why.I'm sure that I'm not the only one who believes that this whole trilogy contains a lot of typical boring Hollywood contents such as dull jokes, a very easily predictible plot and a mixture of races like an Olympics game, just to catch all type of audience. However, what made the first movie worth seeing for me were its quite strong cinematography, sophisticated use of guns (oh, who could forget that unnecessary but equally satisfactory use of front gun on the aircraft by Statham!) and funny surprise elements, such as jokes on Arnie's governorship. In this movie, the latter is only added by two scenes of Uncle Chuckie and other than that, everything about the scenario is as much predictible and typical as it could be. In fact, it goes as far as all the good guys getting away in one piece from any kind of danger! I mean, even the cyborgs in Terminator injured and suffered more. The fact that JCVD's fighting skills are just limited to one long kick was another disappointment about this sequel.Then, why so many people liked it? In two words: Chuck Norris. Seeing the old man in an action movie with his fellas is just what an average American 80s action movie enthusiast would need to adore this piece. So basically, if you're not fan of such a nostalgia, then it's ABSOLUTELY normal that you didn't rate this movie any more than 6 or the first one.",4,0,0,23 February 2020
Empire of the Sun," Very nice - to help you fall asleep
","The focus on the daily life in a PoW camp full of Anglo-American prisoners from Shanghai is indeed a distinct aspect of the movie. Another positive part of the movie was of course the acting laid out by young Bale and Malcovich.Whereas a good narrative would be enough to make this one a must-see World War II classic, after a while I felt like the narrative slowed down and started to focus on so many unnecessary details that I wished the end of the movie to come anytime soon after the first 90 minutes - and I'm pretty sure that I am on top 10% of the most patient people who have seen this piece. Indeed after a point I started to give the movie a second, a third, a fourth and so on chances but it never took any of them.In a nutshell, a type of movie when you stay up late in front of the TV and run into while swapping channels, see talented actors in the cast and decide to give it a shot, then fall asleep while you watch it and don't care about the rest of it when you wake up.",5,2,8,31 August 2018
