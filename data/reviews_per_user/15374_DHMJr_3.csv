The Blair Witch Project," Not All That It's Cracked Up To Be
","I was so eager to see this film. I read the reviews, went and purchased a ticket for the first available show in Atlanta. This was supposed to be a shocking and horrifying film. I did not get that out of the film. I will say that the actors were fantastic. The relationship between Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard was the element of the film that kept it moving. I was never on the end of my seat and did not feel as if I was watching a horror movie. Once again I was waiting for the film to take off and put a little scare into the audience. No ooohs, or screams or any reaction whatsoever from the crowd. I would recommend it because it was an interesting film due to the way it was made but don't expect to be frightened. I really thought that it would be true horror and it turned out to be a very successfully marketed film that never really gave me what I was looking for. A GOOD SCARE.",Null,0,1,3 August 1999
The Matrix," THE MATRIX......IT IS THE REAL DEAL!!!!!!
","What A Flick!!!  I saw it, got into a conversation about it at work and went with a co-worker to see it again.  I have not seen a Sci-Fi movie with this much thought in its conception and effort to bring the visual idea to the screen since the 'Terminator' or `Star Wars'. I could only imagine what a great book it was (if it was ever a book) or would have been.  Then to top such an interesting story.... the movie was made like nothing I have ever seen.  The flips, defiance of gravity and physical acrobatics were just too much.  I saw `The Making of  The Matrix' on HBO and I know sport teams that don't train as hard as the actors did for this movie.  UNREAL!!!  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss  and Hugo Weaving were exceptional in their portrayals.  I am not a major Sci-Fi movie goer but I am a constant movie goer and if a film is good, I will give it its due. This is a Must See.DHM",Null,0,0,13 April 1999
The Godfather," The Godfather-The Greatest Film In Modern Times
","The Godfather-The Greatest Film In Modern TimesThere is no other film that embodies the greatness of American film making such as `The Godfather'.  The film communicates many different things on many different levels to the audience.  First and foremost is the importance of family.  The Don has never made any apologies for the life that he leads and did it all for the sake of his family.  It is true that there is no honor among thieves but this is a movie.  For the mere sake of the story, Don Vito Corleone is an honorable man.  His word is bond and he is not a selfish cheat.  Don Vito Corleone's most appealing asset is his relationship with his family.  Although the film starts with Don Vito Corleone's reign as Godfather, the film is focused on the reign of Michael. There are things that I learned in this film and the other two films that I carry with me today.  `Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer' is just one of the things that I think are important from that film.  `Never hate your enemies for it clogs your judgment' is another.The film shows that even the best made plans can go off course.  Don Vito never planned that life for Michael.  Without telling too much of the picture I can say once again it is the greatest film that I have ever seen and I have seen a great number.  Gone with the Wind is an epic and as all time period pieces go, it does make us think about when times were different.  I never could relate to GWTW.  Living in Atlanta it is forced upon you but still does not quite cut it.  It is much different than Star Wars because it appeals to a more earthly and realistic side of movies. Sci-Fi is a favorite of mine but this does not compare.  Good overtakes evil in the Star Wars saga and in the Godfather films we are always cheering on the bad guys.  They pay for their sins in triplicate, but still they would never change the lives that they lead.Finally, the film is ageless.  I still get the same rush from the movie that I did when I was first old enough to comprehend the true dynamics of the story so many years ago.  We will always have corruption, murder, and power brokering in the underworld and it will in many cases be intertwined with certain political figures.  Another thing that will remain a constant is the love for family and the undying care a father has for his children.  A father will give the lesson, may it be right or wrong by other's standards, this is who we are, this is what we do, and this is how we do it.The Godfather will reveal the many different things in the family, but most of all...it is about a father , his sons, and their business.Francis Ford Coppola did a wonderful job bringing that story to the people.DHM",Null,0,2,15 August 1998
