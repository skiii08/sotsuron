The Benchwarmers," Better than expected
","I went to this pretty much knowing it was going to be dumb, but I was pleasantly proved wrong. I hated Napolean Dynamite and usually can't stand that guy, but he was really pretty funny in this. I'll just put it this way, it was more or less an hour and a half 3 stooges episode centered around baseball. Lots of good physical humor. It was nothing special but overall, good for some laughs and pretty entertaining. Is it considered a spoiler if I say to watch out for Dan Patrick's cameo with his monster sideburns??? Although I was disappointed that Adam Sandler didn't make a Waterboy-esquire appearance by getting up in the crowd and giving a 'YOU CAN DO IT!' If you go into this knowing what to expect, and not expecting a life-altering, ground breaking film, you'll probably like it. It's definitely funnier than any of the other Rob Schneider vehicles (deuce, the animal, etc...)",7,1,4,8 April 2006
