Blade Runner 2049," Where is the Scifi in this!?
","These days, you can not rely on the reviews on IMDb. I feel these reviews are paid ones to lure people to go and watch the movies. Which are really pathetic. Being a Big fan of scifi movies. I had gone for the movie with my wife. Expecting awesome movie partly cause it has Riddley scott name associated with it. And to top it of i had gone for an IMAX 3D. it was totally not worth it. No Idea if a movie having some holograms(Sorry, Foolish hologram) + Some Flying cars makes it a scifi movie!? You know what, every alternate movies in bollywood has the same sort of story which we saw.Also, I completely fail to understand that why directors have to make movie in IMAX 3D/3D as other than IMAX-3D animation at the start of the movie was the really IMAX-3D experience than the full movie.Giving this movie 1 star as there is no option to not give it.... Don't waste your money on this piece of S#@t!!!",1,40,86,9 October 2017
