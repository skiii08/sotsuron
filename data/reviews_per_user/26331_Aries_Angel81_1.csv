National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Entertaining for what it was
","I watched this movie expecting exactly what I got. I wanted to escape reality for roughly two hours and was given that opportunity with this film. In a time where so much emphasis is placed on historical accuracy, misplaced patriotism, and lack of imagination, this movie was a breath of fresh air. I love the mixture of actual history with fiction. This movie offers the opportunity for children to research actual events on their own as opposed to being told what's real and what isn't.If your intent is to watch a film and receive a history lesson, I suggest checking out the History Channel or better yet pick up a book. If you just want to be entertained and learn a few things along the way, definitely check this film out.",7,0,0,7 January 2009
