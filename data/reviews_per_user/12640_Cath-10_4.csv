Marie Antoinette," A pleasant movie but nothing on history
","Marie-Antoinette is a very pleasant movie, that will greatly appeal to all female teenagers dreaming of wearing extravagant dresses and shoes, going everyday to the hairdresser and eating expensive macarons. I did enjoy watching it as it was fun, even though the second part gets a little boring. However, what was the point in renting the palace of Versailles since the movie completely ignores Histoy ? Marie-Antoinette is shown as a bubble-head who spends her time thinking about where she will go out, when in reality she was politically-aware, supporting conservatism and divine royalty, which was all she had ever known. Also why show her confronting the crowd of commoners since the movie never says a word about French history and people's sufferings at the time ? I don't see the point. I spent a pleasant time watching the movie but I had forgotten it entirely the following day.",4,4,6,12 October 2006
Legends of the Fall," So bad that you won't believe what you see
","This movie is probably one of the most boring movies ever made. I went and saw this movie because the romantic trailer and its sublime music had made me enthusiast. Alas ! The music actually came from 'The Last of the Mohicans' and the real soundtrack proved to be horribly bad. But it is nothing compared to the movie. Before watching it, you had better know that everything is bad in this movie : the actors play so bad that it is hardly believable that the producer did not sue them. Brad Pitt plays as if he was starring in a Levi's advertisement, Julia Ormond is as forgettable as ever, and Anthony Hopkins is so ridiculous that I doubt he mentions that movie on his career resumes. As to the plot, it is worse ! You don't need to see the film to know what happens to the characters : it has the more predictable plot you will ever see ! The only quality could be that this melodrama is really melodramatic, but after one hour, it is so melodramatic that you begin to wonder if it is not a caricature. One thing is sure : some characters in that movie are REALLY unlucky, so that you can understand why they are SO depressed. If you are really so happy in your own life that you need a little depression, tjis movie may be made for you. Otherwise, just rent another Edward Zwick movie, 'Glory'; at least you will lean history and see that a director may make the best and the worst movies in his career.",1,13,33,3 November 1998
Life Is Beautiful," A comedy that lacks brilliance and respect
","Would 'Life is beautiful' have had so good reviews, had there not been part of the movie about the holocaust ? I really doubt it. This movie is only a dull comedy that lacks brilliance and is based on rather silly gags. It is also flatly shot. But the real bad part on that movie is that by showing the concentration camnps as it does, it lets the audience think that the Holocaust was not so terrible after all. Begnini shows the concentration camp as if it was the Warsaw ghetto : people are working hard and some die in the process, but the very idea that there were some gas chambers working in order to annihilate millions of people is hardly evoked. The very fact that the little Giuseppe survives with so little trouble is hardly acceptable when one knows how mercilessly children were exterminated. Of course, some passages of the movie are full of emotion, but they are only minutes in a two-hour movie for which Begnini lacks the necessary tact to use such a subject. If I do believe that his intentions were pure and noble when he shot this movie, I hardly appreciate the intense marketing surrounding it. It does lack respect towards such a grave and important matter.",Null,3,6,10 November 1998
Blade Runner," Dream of the Unicorn
","No need here to repeat how great a movie Blede Runner is. But I think it useful to explain the meaning of the dream of the unicorn : in the new version (the director's cut), Deckard dreams of a unicorn. And at the very end of the movie, when he comes bak to his flat to take Rachel with him, he sees a little origami of a unicorn, left by the other policeman, Gaff. This means that Gaff knows what he dreamt of, just like Deckard knew Rachel's personal memories. This obviously means that Deckard is a replicant himself...",10,0,1,29 October 1998
