Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Every Saga has a Beginning....
","And the marketing began anew. The story seemed horribly close to 'Episode IV', and yes, many a person was pi$$ed to find out, a month before the film was released, Qui Gon didn't make it to a sequel (and twice as pi$$ed about Darth Maul), but it was Lucas back in action and Star Wars was reborn.It was all new, yet eerily familiar. All in all, it was still cool. The introduction of new characters and the first look at familiar characters who we knew had 30 years before the time of the Rebellion's first great victory upon the Death Star.Yeah, we knew who was who, and what laid ahead, but it was interesting all the same, even if it missed epic by just that much.",7,1,2,11 September 2008
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Saturday Matinée at its finest...
","The film, as we all know the love child of Spielberg and Lucas, was an ode to the Saturday matinée serials they grew up with.As if 'Star Wars' wasn't enough, the film shot Harrison Ford well past superstardom and into a box office all his own. It also cemented the fact that both Spielberg and Lucas were the best at their crafts.Epic in scope, awesome in story with an excellent pace this film does what it needs to; Takes you on the journey. Easily the best of the now quadrilogy, with 'Last Crusade' a close second.",10,0,1,14 September 2008
Casablanca," '... human life is cheap.'
","Where to begin..? Originally believed a 'B' film in their product, Warner Bros. never conceived the effect the movie would have. Shot in sequence due to a script written daily, the actors never knew what to expect from the characters day after day. The fact that not even the writers knew who would win the girl till the night before the classic scene was shot. And yet 'Casablanca' is listed at No. 2 on the AFI top 100 films of all time (though should, in all actuality, be flip-flopped with 'Citizen Kane' for the top spot). With success in 'High Sierra' and 'The Maltese Falcon' (Thanks in large part to a rather ignorant George Raft) Bogart was well on his way to being a legitimate leading man. This film would make him a legend a studio star and later, a legend. Sure his body of work was the main factor, but 'Casablanca' in hand with 'Falcon' created the mystique of Bogart which films like 'To Have and Have Not' and 'The Big Sleep' only fueled. A mediocre effort from Warners which molded many of their castaway Euro-stars into a great and well written tapestry where everyone stole the scene from everyone else in such fashion it appeared seamless. The film moves along introducing us to each character in perfect detail, the harsh environment of Casablanca, that war-torn sweat-box which could easily double as a Tatooine spaceport from 'Star Wars', and the Nazi imperial rule who smothers them all. Never looked upon as epic and not even filmed as such 'Casablanca' exudes Epic film in a nice tidy package. With all around fantastic effort from everyone on screen with a great turn by Claude Raines the film is a must see and worthy of No. 2 on the list (sandwiched between 'Kane' and 'The Godfather'). Quickly paced and keeping you in your seat, get the popcorn and don't even think of going to the bathroom.",10,4,5,1 June 2009
Star Trek," To Boldly Go Where No Trek Has Gone Before...
","To those of you 'Trekkies' (No I will not say Trekker) who walked out at the near halfway point of the film, and you know who you are... stupid. Accept change. For months we've seen the catchphrase 'This is not your father's Star Trek', but it is still Gene Roddenberry's tale of 'Wagontrain to the stars'. From the start, if you are accepting of change, this film kicks off with a hellava bang and rolls pretty well. Those who may also be comic book geeks would recognize this film as a 'What If..?' or 'Elseworlds' tale, asking the question of 'What would happen if..?' and giving us a very imaginative yet faithful answer. No one said this was TOS redone, but TOS reborn. Since we already know the set standard of time in the Trek Universe (even the errors and mistakes in continuity), isn't it just really damn cool to start over, yet not, all at the same time? J.J. Abrhams brought to the film what the feature film series needed two decades ago... a big name director with big time vision. Wise, Meyer, Nimoy and Frakes all did great jobs (as did those who remain nameless for what they had to work with), but the franchise long ago required a Spielberg or Jackson or as it almost was once upon a time, a Lucas to bring the vision of wild west in space to vivid light (or Idustrial Light and Magic). Yes, plenty of you hardcore to the death 'Trekkies' will curse J.J.'s name wish him death for changing your precious universe, but that's your loss for not recognizing a change for the better. (We all remember how Tasha Yar became a Romulan do we not?) Its not a prequel technically, its not an update or really even a 'reboot', but it is epic in scope given the vast material which preceded it. Very well paced with action, drama, humor and place-setting (oh the joy of sequels) it is a great new look at our old favorites (most of the actors partially picked and approved by TOS vet Nimoy). Worthy of the tag 'epic' and a must see for any science fiction fan or real movie buff. Bring popcorn and bathroom breaks forbidden.",9,1,9,16 May 2009
Citizen Kane," Rosebud... who'd have guessed?
","Originally I was accepting of the nickname of the sled, but finding out what 'Rosebud' actually was code for in the world of William Randolph Hearst... Welles was probably lucky he wasn't killed, literally. Listed as No. 1 on the AFI top 100 films of all time I think it falls just a tad short. I'd have been more than happy to see it in the No. 2 or even 3 hole behind 'Casablanca' and 'The Godfather' respectively. The film still is an awesome piece of American film-making and in my opinion represents one of the first great 'indie' films as everyone aside from R.K.O. turned away the young upstart and his blasphemous script (with credit to his writing partner Herman J. Mankiewicz). The film is thorough in bringing along for the journey, even if it does hit a hump at the midpoint it follows quickly enough to keep us interested. Obviously it has survived the ultimate test, which is time, to prove itself since it was basically left for dead upon original release. It also didn't help that 'Kane' is one of those films you really do need to take in more than once to fully appreciate the film-scape. (In tribute, just see their reference in an episode of 'Family Guy' as 'Two long boob-less hours!') Given that Orson Welles was a filmmaker well ahead of his time, it leaves one to wonder what his legacy may have been if 'Kane' had been more widely accepted by the film industry and the populace. Unfortunately we are left to realize his greatness too close to his death and well after it. How things may have been different in Hollywood as a whole if he had been anointed the master director and ringleader of the Mercury Theater he was instead of relegated to studio actor under the 'Dream Factory' thumb. Luckily, we'll always have his 'one hit wonder' (to those who simply ignore his body of work) to remind us of 'wasted potential' (due in NO part to Welles' own effort) in epic film. Enjoy the movie, pay attention and no bathroom breaks. Oh, and pay homage to Rosebud.",9,0,1,1 June 2009
Batman Returns," A very special Christmas episode...
","Batman at X-Mas......OK, I'm interested. Originally to cast Annette Benning, the CatWoman role seemed to be in safe hands with Ms. Michelle. And Danny DeVito being allowed his freedom of range in playing the Penguin was a great touch. Add some Walken, and we have a film.Not as big a blockbuster as the original, it still carried well. Unfolding a bit slowly and seemingly a bit mixed, it didn't quite follow the comic lore, but, neither did any of the other films in the original quadrilogy.Keaton played his role a bit better this time around, but was also given more script and screen in and out of the mask. He also had the advantage of being the original.Plan on the popcorn, but no breaks allowed.",7,1,5,11 September 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," 'Do you even know how to kill me?'
","Marvel Comics has taken great steps in bringing along their film franchise, growing their characters and getting them ready for the 'bigtime' spotlight formerly reserved for the likes of 'Batman' and 'Superman'. With the past success of such Marvel titans 'X-Men & X-2', 'Spider-Man', 'Hulk' and now 'Iron Man', the 'X-Men Origin' series is expected to catapult the ensemble into their own tales of derring do... however 'Wolverine' didn't hit the mark. 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' marks the first of the 'Origin' line which we already know has sequels for separate characters such as Deadpool and Magneto in the works, but being the first, it felt rushed. Wolverine is already a mainstay, especially on film as he dominated the ensemble 'X-Men' series all on his own, but his first 'solo' film just seemed really smushed together for a lack of better phrasing. Yes, the origin tale place-setting of he and Sabertooth (excellently played by Liev Schriber), the Weapon X Project (Roman numeral 10, fool) and Striker plus the path-crossing heavyweights such as Cyclops, Professor-X, several members of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (comic wise anyway) and the like... too many deaths of characters who should have carried on, too little emphasis on what are actual comic plot points... it just came off as a little messy. Please don't get wrong, Jackman does his usual best with his fave character to play and will do so again in the upcoming sequel... but the play itself of events is just too much (or too little depending on which plot point). Still a viable film in the Marvel Universe, it will definitely serve as a blockbuster to get the ball rolling on the 'Origins' series and renew interest in the still to come 'X-Men: First Class', but to this comic book geek who adores the original ideas of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, et al; this film just veers a little too much off course. Just shy of comic epic, bring the popcorn and skip the bathroom breaks.",7,3,7,16 May 2009
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The end of the Saga... or is it?
","OK, for those who care in the Star Wars universe, we know that there are 3 episodes left in the series...... but even if we never see it, this was a fitting end.Sure, with the pre-quels in place, everything seems to fit just that much better, and make a little bit more sense of the smallest details.Yes the updated or 'Special Edition' supplied a better ending and gave us a new 'ghost' version of Anakin, but either way, the Ewoks are still fuzzy and will never be as annoying as Jar-Jar Binks.Maybe the final battle could have been worked a bit better in special effects evolution, more Episode III than Adventures of Robin Hood, but it still works.And it still leaves us to wonder, just what happens next.Very close to epic, but the Ewoks just don't carry us there. Bring them some popcorn, though, and no bathroom breaks.",7,0,1,11 September 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Like Deju Vu all over again...
","OK.... ... if Episode I was eerily like Episode IV, Episode II was certainly going to try and rip off 'Empire..'.Well, we got to meet the new Sith Lord, and Christopher Lee was already, easily, the Man... so this just made it better. Add a little Jackie Chan-esquire Yoda action with a dash of the Fett-Man's dad... mix with a few million clone troopers and big fat whiny bitch Jedi savior... sure, you got a movie.Epic, no, not quite. But, definitely a popcorn film, no breaks allowed.",6,1,3,11 September 2008
Man of Steel," Superman Begins...
","That would have been a more appropriate title for this, the first in what I'm sure will be a trilogy for Superman with Man of Steel being better suited to the sequel. In a way, it felt much like 'Superman Begins' ran right into 'Man of Steel' as the script's first half rushed to deliver the correct message before the mayhem and bedlam of the second half slug-fest. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film and feel Henry Cavill will do quite well as Kal-El, but Superman has over 70 years of origin retelling and storyline which can easily be spaced, spread and placed across any number of films... no need to hurry.As for 'Man of Steel', it definitely had a somewhat intergalactic 'Batman Begins' feel to it and it should have. That's no slight against Christopher Nolan, it is his demand for realism and character development that made the Dark Knight Trilogy the success it was and will again be a building block of Superman's initial trilogy. Personally, I'd have no problem if they copied the exact formula and Warner Bros. will be lucky if Nolan and Snyder can. The WB have a history of interference with their DC tent-pole line (Batman & Robin, Green Lantern) and need a Nolan or Snyder to just keep the execs in their suits at bay. 'Superman Begins' maybe should have been followed by 'Man of Steel' and an eventual 'Last Son of Krypton' or some other fill in the blank third act, but I'm sure the marketing gurus felt otherwise.The real film rests in the first half. Act two pushes for the high-adrenaline of the 3rd Act and loses itself in a rush to just utterly destroy Metropolis and kill, literally, countless tens of thousands. The closing leaves little to ponder in the way of continuation, hints of 'LexCorp', 'Wayne Enterprises' and a city to rebuild as the Daily Planet's newest hire comes on board though I'm sure Goyer/Nolan/Snyder will have plenty to give. The fact that Ben Affleck has been hired to deliver a more Frank Miller 'TDKR' turn in the role of the Caped Crusader (effectively ending any link to the Nolan trilogy and an inherent time-line) tells us this won't be the same old 'same 'ole'. And kudos for it as DC is in desperate need of an 'Iron Man' to 'The Avengers' build up over the next few years.Like any Nolan film, we great great turns in form of character. Russel Crowe delivers in his take of Jor-El as does Kevin Costner as Superman's adoptive father Jonathan Kent. Amy Adams gives us a great spin on a Lois Lan who actually can investigate a story (even if its in retrospect) and Michael Shannon does General Zod proud.Though reaching epic for the first half, its still a great film overall and a definite place setting for greater things (much like, but not as well as 'Batman Begins'). Bring the Reece's Pieces and popcorn... no bathroom breaks.",8,2,5,4 September 2013
North by Northwest," Bond... James Bond
","Cary Grant, who had turned down an early opportunity to play Ian Flemming's suave super-spy did in fact play a version of the character here.Cool, calculating and turning back the superior villains at every turn, Roger Thornhill made for a great anti-hero. So well played in the trademark gray suit, Connery may have almost been playing off this role.Though shunning the 007 role due to the prospect of having to do sequels, Grant helped to generate the run of Bonds to come without really even trying. A Hitchcock triumph, bring the popcorn and no bathroom breaks.",9,1,3,11 September 2008
Spider-Man," 'I'm Batman...'
","When Batman spoke that answer to a scared thug in 1989 he dealt a blow for every Comic character, not just the Warner's backed DC characters, to the major studios in saying 'We belong here.'... Unfortunately for Marvel, they couldn't compete till now. Sure, 'Blade' came off huge, but very different than his comic origins though for the better. 'X-Men' was a surprise hit and great comic book film, again, if not following the comic lore page by page. 'Spider-Man' does so nearly panel for panel right from a grand splash page. Updated for the times, the story still holds true. 'With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility...' and the film conveys Stan Lee's basic message with oomph.In true Marvel fashion, not over the top or straying from the character, it hits home. A normal teenager dealing with extraordinary circumstances and walking the high wire ever so carefully along the way. Perhaps the most cinematic anti-stereotypical ending in film as Boy meets Girl, Boy chases Girl, Boy saves Girl, Boy rejects Girl!!? Yes, that one closing scene where Peter turns from not only Mary Jane but from a part of himself indeed epitomizes what Comic Heroes have done for nearly 70 years... sacrifice. And in one instant, it is made clear. Perhaps the perfect Comic to Film example... where 'Batman Begins' was 90% dead on, 'Spidey' reaches 99%. With this film, its not Marvel vs. DC but another example, a shining example, of 'We belong here.'... 'Nuff Said.",9,0,1,10 September 2008
Quantum of Solace," An Amount of Comfort...
","Yes, the title 'Quantum of Solace' is taken from a short story of Flemming's... this film however has nothing to do with it. The title and it's scientific meaning is quite applicable as at this point there is quite an amount of comfort with Daniel Craig as 007. Though a bit more violent than most of it's predecessors, 'Solace' follows the current formula with excellent results. Very little in the gadget department, but the right mix of guns, booze and hot broads. Connery (and to an extent even Lazenby) should be proud. Yes, Roger Moore was a bit outspoken on the violence, but he was the comedic Bond. A one two punch of 007 hasn't been thrown this hard nor this effective since the original debut of 'Dr. No' & 'From Russia...', the last one-two combination of any real 007 mettle being Moore's 'For Your Eyes Only' & 'Octo*****'. Again, the formula of little gadgetry, a lot of girls and villainous stories. Though I agree with Judy Dench and Daniel Craig that the characters of 'Moneypenny' and 'Q' should be returned to the background environment, I'd hate for it to be at the expense of the current formula. The first 007 sequel (or prequel, depending on how you look at it) to pick up directly where the preceding film left off and introducing us to Quantum, the obligatory successor to 'S.P.E.C.T.R.E.' (which just sounds cooler anyway) we're given insight that Bond's job is far from over... and that there are sequels a plenty to follow. The mix of friends, villains and Bond Girls makes great contrast against Craig's brooding and bruised agent (both internally and externally). The fact that M can note 'They will do anything for you, won't they?' is a great psychological dig at the many years established as the screen's most suave user of the female form... physically, mentally and fatally. Though I was not a fan of the opening title sequence (a departure from the established formula from Maurice Binder and his successors) I was pleased to see the return of the 'Three White Dots' at films end as a pre-cursor to the next film. A great popcorn film which keeps you in the seat. Well paced and action filled with very little lag.... no bathroom breaks.",8,3,8,18 April 2009
Batman Begins," Qui-Gon Jinn, Jedi Master..?
","I thought Liam Neeson would be reprising his Jedi role in 'Episode III', released a few weeks later in the summer blockbuster schedule, but suddenly I see him playing the Jedi Master the way he should have been in 'Episode I'.Sure, the story for 'Begins' doesn't follow the Batman mythos note by note, but this was easily the closest story of comic book to film I've seen. Only the original 'Spider-Man' came close to actual comic book lore, and didn't miss by much.For this reason, I have listed the film in my 'Best of' category.This edition of the Dark Knight is a sideways view of the Gotham savior Tim Burton had envisioned, but far closer to the Frank Miller vision than Burton could get.Though not directly credited, Miller's 'Year One' storyline, a defining Batman comic mini-series of the 1980's was the driving force behind the screenplay. Miller, not only a genius for his 'Sin City' comic and film work, but Ben Affleck's 'Daredevil' version as well, helped mold Batman back from his post Adam West comic persona and the Dark Knight man-hunter phase that followed.More stylish, slick and polished than 1989's 'Batman', it sheds new light on obviously Batman's beginnings as well as his complex persona and the intricate world around him.Not better per say, but different than Tim Burton's original film, this one can be said.. epic.",9,1,1,11 September 2008
The Dark Knight," I Believe in Harvey Dent
","I'll be the first to admit, I really was hoping 'Two-Face' would wait till the next film. But having Sal Meroni and The Joker in the film, Dent was on borrowed time. However, I was happily surprised by what turned out not to be a stale Aaron Eckhart performance. Now... Comic Book movies have never been known for actual film-making drama... but HOLY %$@#. To date, 'The Dark Knight' stands as the 'Godfather Part II' of comic films. Christopher Nolan developed these characters to a fine edge in the original so he could develop a new batch in the sequel with everyone being equally fantastic.Unike the original franchise, there was no need to keep rehashing the Origin... Kilmer droned on with it and so did Clooney... well, Batman's over sixty-five years old and we know the story! And kudos for not giving us the origin of the Joker... now you just need to have another actor to do it on screen in the eventual sequel... God help him following Ledger's overly hyped but darkly awesome performance.'Knight' will stand as a classic because it can stand on it's own. Even if you didn't see the first, you can follow the sequel.. and that is what makes a good sequel really good. Again, we all know the characters, even if you never really read a comic... it's pop culture. Yes it is violent for a comic book film (as are most comic films), but this was REALISTIC. This was 'Untouchables' violent, 'Godfather' or as any other reality based film may have been, and that is the irony. The Comic Book is suddenly as real as it gets. The Joker isn't some guy all HeeHee and Whoopie cushions... this takes Nicholson's more twisted turn and cranks it up to full! The Joker is a believable study in an urban chaos sociopath. And Dent, is extremely believable as the man pushed just too damn far.The supporting cast is obviously a collection of Award winning actors who jell together seamlessly in this world of the not so super Superhero... depressed yet defending the light.Does it follow exactly? No, there are a few slight liberties taken, but just a few. Is it Meroni or the Joker responsible for Harvey? Or, is it like the comics, where the work of the crime boss laid the disfigured work for a twisted Joker to mold and manipulate as he has done in many a 'Two-Face' tale over the years? That's close enough to the comic for me... And Thank You for killing Miss Dawes... oh sweet irony from the standard boy saves girl fare.The story was great.. well paced and combined evenly with the action. I was a little disappointed in the lack of Gotham landscape the original possessed... I'd have enjoyed seeing more of the mighty Wayne tower, center of a beefed up Chicago 'Gotham' and the monorail than just seeing plain old Chicago. Obviously, the thirst for knowledge about the eventual sequel will be insatiable. Each of the major villains portrayed in the franchise so far are still available to return as Scarecrow already has for a cameo... Dent is 'maybe sort of possibly' dead and obviously The Joker is captured... oh yeah, Qui-Gon Jinn * I mean R'as is just waiting for his dip in the Lazarus Pit. Another true to comic idea that the original franchise (Sorry Tim Burton, Burn in Hell Shumacher) failed with... The villains don't always die. Wayne Manor should be rebuilt by then... and so will the Cave. See it twice as there is a lot of info to digest the first time. That, and its an awesome film and film score that should be absorbed on the screen twice anyway.Epic. Not just comic epic or epic in length, but damn fine film epic.",10,3,10,10 September 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Star Wars goes to Hell
","It not only went to Hell, it went with gusto! The story was more original than what we had seen in the prequels, and it was long awaited. Destruction has always been easier than creation, and it was a great ride to see the cosmos crash and burn.Complaint; Anakin took all of 10 seconds to turn into Darth Vader. Hmmm... not quite the emotional, gut-wrenching and tortured decision we thought it was going to be. I had expected more from the Chosen One who would become the scourge of the galaxy. Aside from that though, sure, there were some story gaps and a few things that maybe should have been worked in or out, but hey.... there are potentially three more films to go.With the loose ends not so much tied as lain out for the original trilogy, this one reached epic. No bathroom breaks.",8,0,2,11 September 2008
Iron Man," With Great Power comes Great Responsibility...
","OK, it went to another very popular Marvel Comic flick but the message was loud and clear, especially throughout the second half of the film.An excellent role for the roller-coaster known as Downey Jr., who really seemed to enjoy and excel playing the troubled genius ill-fated billionaire.Did it follow exactly as the 60's story did, no, but damn it was still a good story. It is still a great effort for a 'B' list superhero in the Marvel line-up, getting a treatment on screen better than the returning 'Superman'.Combining elements of yesterday and today.. just as the Batman series (part duex) has been able to do.Let's hope the sequels will follow suit where the X-Men films and Spidey's have faltered.Comic book epic for sure... bring the popcorn and no bathroom breaks.",8,1,2,14 September 2008
Blade Runner," Star Wars meets Witness...
","Harrison Ford certainly has depth... but this role was meaty. Not a run of the mill sci-fi flick, Han Solo's slightly darker edges from 'Star Wars' and 'Empire..' slam into 'Witness' hard nose John Book and do it well.Called back from retirement or waiting to die, Ford's 'Bladerunner' is on the edge and keeps us on the edge. Sure it does drag in some spots but will pick up with the ebb and flow of the film's course. Rutger Hauer's shining moment with some great roles for the younger Sean Young and Darryl Hannah... Well scripted, well paced and well done. Popcorn for sure.I've had the opportunity to see it on screen in re-release twice and highly recommend it should the opportunity present itself.",8,1,2,14 September 2008
Casino Royale," Ian Flemming's actual Bond...
","From Connery to Brosnan, there has been one constant; They didn't look like the written Bond. 007 was never intended a pretty boy handsome spy, but on film he translated to it.Enter Daniel Craig: I'm not saying he's not a handsome man, but he is closer to the more realistic Bond Flemming wrote 50 years ago. His gritty and not so smooth features are closer to the Hoagy 'Stardust' Carmichael the face was based upon. Add in the original Bond novel, and yes, we have a movie.Now, most of the Bonds reach near epic proportion, more than just a popcorn movie often does... this follows those footsteps. Exotic locations, little gadgetry and more roughhouse, this follows the ideals of 'Dr. No' and 'From Russia...' than let's say 'Die Another Day'. Yes, Judy Dench as M throws the time-line way out of whack for actual Bond-o-philes, but even the producers admitted they couldn't recast the role any better, so tough.Craig enters the role at just the right time, a little known face in the U.S., with several international roles, he is definitely fresh and hits home with the brooding and broken Bond, who we've seen glimpses of in established Bonds before him.Is he the best 007? Far too soon to tell. But he's off to one damn fine start.",9,2,4,10 September 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Only once in a great while...
","It's not often that a film is released and it literally changes society. Pop culture, modern film and cinema history took a hit when this film was released... yes even before the 'Episode IV' title was attached.'Star Wars' wasn't just another Sci-Fi film, it was the first time in a long time a filmmaker's vision transferred to celluloid untouched by executive hands and actually worked.Sure, millions will say that it's one of the greatest films ever... perhaps in Sci-Fi circles. It was, easily, one of the most influential. Not because it spawned a billion dollar industry for special FX, toys and marketing or five sequel films... but it led the way for all the films and filmmakers to follow in it's footsteps.Was it greatly acted? It was OK. Was it greatly written? It was an original, paced story.But with it's effects, score and direction, it all came together... and in the end, that is what great epic film is all about.",8,2,3,11 September 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best of either Trilogy...
","Not as historic or groundbreaking as the original, this film easily represents the 'Godfather part II' of science fiction sequels.There is up and down, black and white with ebb and flow in film... and 'Empire..' hits them all, in order and without dragging it's feet.Maybe because we know a majority of the story already, maybe because it just unfolds and unfolds and then BAM! carbonite. Scoundrels are lovers, dead men are ghosts, Jedi Masters can be two foot nuthin' and Darth Vader is still the biggest intergalactic bastard around (and not much fun to work for).'Empire..' represents the old-school swashbuckling epic that Lucas had envisioned, the episodic Saturday morning matinée you'd show up thirteen weeks in a row to see. To find a film even close you'd need to rent one of Errol Flynn's early Warner Bros. works, and none of them had an eight foot Wookie.Far from a simple transition sequel, 'Empire..' stands above any other film in the six part series, and contains all the spirit, action, emotion and oomph that the prequels fought to give.Epic. 'nuff said.",9,0,1,11 September 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," We named the dog 'Indiana'....
","Well, yes it is true... ... there was a dog named 'Indiana', as well as 'Short Round' and 'Mutt'... see a pattern? But, the guy named after a dog kicked some serious Nazi ass... again.From the start with a great flashback we are taken for a ride, and like the original 'Raiders', we are taken on the journey. Easily a match for the 1981 Blockbuster, this version simply raises the bar in epic scope and adventure.Temple of what?The sweet thing about 'Raiders' and 'Crusade' is that they can both stand alone but are better together. Not quite as Saturday Matinée as the original, but there really isn't anything else that is for that matter.Junior!",9,0,1,14 September 2008
