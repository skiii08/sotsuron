It," A letdown from the story. Otherwise average.
","First of all. This 'scary' movies ain't really so scary. A huge letdown, because the effects are great and I found this new iteration of Pennywise to be much more effective is the 'scary-department'. Mainly thanks to the improved CGI.But the movie never really delivers, I mean I never got even slighty scared this whole movie.The movie is convoluted, but very predictable at the same time.
A big factor in the fact that I didn't find it scary. That and the way the other cast handles themself, almost throughout the whole movie.By itself, the movie is maybe average, but as a remake of IT, not so much.",5,1,2,29 July 2018
Train to Busan," If only train rides were this action packed. Solid performances
","This movie, were actually quite refreshing in a way. Sure there has been hundreds of 'zombie-like' movies. This one were a bit different yet again, but Korean, and also a different setting all together. The movie does contain all the clich√© character types of a zombie movie. But they were very dynamic and all of the main characters seemed like they did perform well in their roles. Even without subtitles I enjoyed the movie, and still understood the plot, but I would have preferred subtitles to understand all the conversations.The train idea, actually worked really well, and made for some interesting sequences, with drama and a claustrophobic feel. Most of the scenarios seemed plausible, but there were a couple of times where I think the CGI were unrealistic, but surely put in there for a more dramatic feel. I think the 'passive bystander' suspense, were a bit overused, maybe again to try and draw on the drama. Other than that, the movie were overall quite well done.",7,1,4,20 September 2016
Bird Box," Bit of a yawn - Not much to it
","It is never a good sign when you start fast-forwarding a movie.The concept for the movie is quite interesting. But sadly enough the movie has no body and no character. Can only rate the movie as average, due to redeeming factors of a good idea and decent cinematography.The movie characters however, are dull and the dialogue is tiring. (Which is what I started to fast forward through).
All the 'flashbacks' seems purely there as a filler to lenghten the runtime.
It is listed as part horror, but there is genuinely nothing even remotely scary about the movie, which was a disappointment to me.The concept of the movie makes it impossible to visualise whatever it is that the people see. Without ruining the mystique and the part that does intrigue, but 'its' presence is visualised quite well in my opinion.",5,0,1,30 March 2019
City of God," Wanting too much, gets convoluted
","I've been wanting to watch this movie for a long time. But ended up not being pulled in.It tried telling too many stories in one, and to me it just seemed too incoherent and convoluted. I get it's probably the feeling they wanted to portray, that 'City of god' is a town out of order and that things just go round and round in rings.And having said that, then the ending fits.
But I just wanted more of an ending. And I would have liked to have seen a bit more of a story, that just followed one individual or so.Also I have may have hoped for a little more... 'low-level-gang-feel'.",6,0,0,8 February 2020
Green Book," Great chemistry between Viggo and Mahershala.
","The movie were packed with great moments.The chemistry between the two lead roles (Viggo and Mahershala) felt so organic and genuine, like it wasn't even acted.
The character development through out, was very fluid and well done.The movie had many, however subtle moments of laughter (for the viewer) through out the movie.And the movie seemed to have captured the time period quite well and how life was back then.
Also the pace of the movie were balanced nicely. Not too rushed and yet not too much detail into the characters of the movie. It left a little to think about, and just gave the viewer enough to not get bored.",9,0,2,25 July 2019
Alien: Covenant," Disgustingly awful
","This movie is a complete and utter disaster, Prometheus were quite bad, but this movie manages to overdo it, in a negative way. Realism is none existing, crew is bad, acting is worse. Even the visual effects isn't much uplifting, overall a very disappointing watch. Didn't even make it 15 minutes into the movie before I knew it were bad, and you don't think you will make it through. Only by forcing myself to watch it, so I could say I watched it.",2,5,7,14 October 2017
