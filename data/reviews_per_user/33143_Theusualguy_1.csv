Iron Man 3," What was that
","Wow. This movie really didn't capture anything that was special from the first iron man. The gritty-comedic tone set the bar pretty high from the get go, then iron man 2 was released and it was a disappointment.Iron Man 3 however, was even worse then the second one. 6 extremely bad issues with the film:1.) Comedy If i wanted to see a comedy, i would have seen a different movie. NOT IRON MAN 3! This movie is nothing more then snippy one liners and referrals to the avengers (which are funny at first granted, but get extremely repetitive?). 2.) The suit/s. This not a spoiler so yes. In the trailer you see Gwyneth Paltrow in the suit. Firstly, what is the point of Tony stark if his butler can use the suit, let alone Rhodey who pilots his own suit. Very silly. 3.) The portrayal of the Mandarin. If you've read the comics (like me) the mandarin uses rings to control three space alien dragons and has utmost powers. (In the film this unrealistic measure has been toned down a lot)Though to the point of where one of iron man's toughest villains has been disgraced. see the movie and you will understand where i'm coming from. 4.) Plot holes. To give nothing Away, the consistency of plot holes is unbearable, and so easily pick up!5.) That Disney feel to it. This movie is like a family comedy, if you want to take your kids to a family action movie (yet there is little action in this one) take them to this one. 6.) Unnecessary characters. In this movie there is a child, okay, BUT HE IS ONE OF THE CENTRAL CHARACTERS THAT THE MOVIE FOCUSES ON! Disney what have you done to iron man. So in reality don't see this movie unless you want to see what I'm talking about 4/10",4,36,72,1 May 2013
