Men in Black 3," I didn't want to review this film, I was pure disappointed, and NO MEN IN BLACK 4!!!
","I really, really didn't want to do this review the title says it all, I don't want a Men in Black 4 or a new trilogy.But, I just cannot put my finger on what was wrong with it:Was it the f*cking retarded villain, with ludicrous design, mediocre plan, and unbelievable stupid powers?Or the whole confusing f*ckin' time travel concept?The wide build up, the trailers, anticipation, music videos, support by Will Smith, and the positive reviews?The world may never know.I cannot b!tch about the film if I legitimately cannot find or pin point anything wrong with it.I just don't know.At least with other reviews I could name what was wrong I could b!tch for a rhyme or applicable reason FHere's a few examples: Freddy's Revenge, Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, Wes Craven's a New Nightmare, GI Joe: Rise of Cobra, X- Men Origins: Wolverine, Hulk, and last of all Catwoman and Man of Steel.Just to those of you who know me please understand I didn't like this film and I don't know why.",9,1,3,20 July 2014
