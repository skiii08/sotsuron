The Hangover," The Hangover story based on a Simpsons episode
","Obviously the movie built a great deal on the classic 'Viva Ned Flanders' episode of 'The Simpsons' (season 10 in 1999) which is not mentioned elsewhere. The matching in the storyline is significant, in Simpsons Homer takes Ned Flanders to Las Vegas to start enjoying life. Major points where the two pieces meet are the scene, casinos and the hangover in Las Vegas, the appearance of a tiger, Tyson, getting married to a casino employee and so on ... all must be a miraculous coincidence.'The Hangover' clearly has some great jokes but it cannot keep up the same level throughout the 100 minutes therefore the moderate rating. I recommend to watch it just to cheer up but without very high expectations.",6,16,28,4 August 2009
