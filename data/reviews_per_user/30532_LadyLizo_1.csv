Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I am speechless!!!!!!!
","I now realize why I wasn't alive to see the first three in the theatres.The critics seriously scared me when they told the world that the movie was crap and had no value to the movie world. However, after I saw it, my friends and I figured out that they MUST have seen a different film. It was spectacular.BUT!!! THE PHANTOM MENACE is not a perfect flick--George never said that he made one and I never expected it to be. The acting of Natalie and Jake are not as good as I expected, but Liam and Ewan totally made up for it. I missed the romance and the beginning was a little slow, but you have to realize, by the time you get to the end of the movie with all its amazing fight sequences, you'll forgive every tiny mistake that you noticed.If you don't see this movie, you're missing out. Badly.Oh and don't expect to see a lot of Darth Maul. He's an awesome fighter and actor, but he doesn't have a lotta screen time. However, Senator Palpatine does, and he is SOOOOOO good at giving the audience the'I-know-that-I'm-going-to-turn-into-a-villain-and-you-know-I'm-going-to-turn -into-a-villain-just-don't-tell-anyone.' The movie, to use my best friend's term, is 'SWEET!!!'May the force be with you. :)",10,0,0,22 May 1999
