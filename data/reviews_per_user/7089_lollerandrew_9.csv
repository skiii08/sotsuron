The Avengers," An awesome team superhero movie
","After seeing all these characters in previous mcu movies, we get to see them all come together. It was so cool. Loki made a fabulous villain and we got to see how smart this villain was. This movie will always stick out in the mcu and will always be remembered.",9,0,0,19 August 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A great superhero movie
",This movie could not have been executed better. Who knew two unsuccessful comedy directors could make such a great movie. This is just a nail biter super hero movie. One of marvels best. Great action movie.,10,2,5,19 August 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Gave me chills
","Walking into the theater, my knees were shaking. The beginning scene when Clint's family dusted was just jaw dropping and gave you chills. The plot was a genius idea. People predicted that they went back into time but they added a ton of new things in the plot that was shocking like black widows death for the stone. The final battle was not enjoyable if your not a marvel fan. They ended each character just the way they shouldve ended. This movie is an easy 10/10.",10,47,74,16 August 2019
Batman Begins," Great start of the batman dynasty
","This was a pretty good movie even though they started it off going back in time and seeing Bruce's backround and it was confusing but necessary. It's a great, I inspiring movie abd you felt for Bruce at the end when his mansion burns down after all his family had been through in that house. A good movie to watch for a movie night once in a while.",8,1,1,19 August 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," The next step to the mcu
","This movie is great l, but it is better when you view it from Thanos's perspective. It has all the superheros in this one, and it was so thrilling. But I felt like it was a new step of the mcu when Thanos snaps his fingers at the end to kill half the half the universe. Great movie and gave me chills at the end.",9,0,0,19 August 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Not the greatest but love new heros
","This was not the greatest mcu movie, I didn't like the whole heidra situation at the beginning but it lead to Wanda and quick silver. Ultron was cool, but still wasn't a huge fan of the plot. I also didn't like the relationship between black widow and Bruce but it didnt make the movie to bad. This was an okay movie.",9,0,0,19 August 2019
The Dark Knight," Best movie ever
",This movie was just amizingly executed. Heath Ledger made his joker the greatest villain of all time. Christian Bale did a fabulous job as the Batman better than he was in Batman Begins. The lead up to the movie was just you couldn't take your eyes off the screen. It nailed the point of the hero Batman with the dark tone and the scary villain joker. This movies action scenes were just jaw dropping. This is the best movie of all time. Christopher Nolan's best movie.,10,0,1,16 August 2019
Inception," Brilliant and creative
","Christopher Nolan has had some great movies, and this doesn't reach first, it's right behind dark Knight, but this movie was still a masterpiece. The dream inside a dream idea was just so creative and smart of Nolan. It has a fabulous cast, and the steps of each part of the movie is golden. One of my favorites.",10,0,1,19 August 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," Great way to end the trilogy
","After two very successful batman movies, they summed up the trilogy flawlessly. You have Tom Hardy as bane and he made an amazing villain. He was scary, cool, strong, and wanted to do finish Ras Al Ghul's destiny from the first one which made the villain backround a good villain backround. You have the conflict when Bruce and Alfred go their separate ways. You have great action scenes with batman beating up banes fighters which was super cool. They shouldve ended it with a mystery, was Bruce really dead when Alfred saw him, but they still made it work. I think the dark Knight trilogy is the greatest trilogy of all time.",9,1,2,19 August 2019
