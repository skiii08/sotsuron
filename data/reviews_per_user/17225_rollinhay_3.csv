Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Easily the most entertaining adventure this year!
","On Stranger Tides is a crazy wicked tongue in cheek adventure that would leave you hooked and grinning throughout. Rob Marshall paces the movie superbly, flowing joyously from one crazy adventure into another. To me, this is the most entertaining Pirate movie in the series.Johnny Depp is at his outrageous best as Jack Sparrow, and Penelope Cruz's Angelica throws in a love interest that brings out a previously unseen moral angle into Jack's devil-may-care bravado. That is where the strength of the screenplay lies, in giving us a brand new Jack who still is strongly familiar. Geoffery Marsh's Barbossa is delightful too. The CGI and special effects are perfectly balanced, handsomely making amends for the jarring CGI overdose of 'At World's End'. On the flip side, Blackbeard was a character lacks the swagger and the menace he should have had. The romance between the pastor and the mermaid is too saccharine. Yet, the movie's highs easily overshadow the lows. And the series' trademark tongue-in-cheek humor is sharp, shining specially in the taut chemistry between Depp and Cruz.All in all Pirates IV is a fantastic spectacle and you wouldn't want to stay ashore and miss out on this adventure.",9,0,0,21 May 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," The Apes shall rumble your mind
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is that rare combination of unbelievable CGI, perfect pacing, satisfying characterization and a monumental protagonist that leaves you riveted from start to finish. Almost Shakespearean in its flow, Rise is a powerful narrative of the fall and the rise of Cesar, a super-intelligent ape, whom we see morph from a precocious baby into a rousing leader. And all this without speaking a word, well almost.James Franco is fairly intense, Freida Pinto looks pretty and the other actors do a fair job. But the screen belongs to Andy Serkis' Cesar, who takes Miming to a new high. Every expression and crease on the Ape's face exudes emotion and intensity. And intelligence, plenty of it. I was silently hooting when Cesar has his first major leadership moment against his first simian adversary (no more details for fear of spoilers). The final action sequence is mind blowing and the movie has a very satisfying end.A definite watch.",Null,0,1,12 August 2011
Thor," Grandiose action meets simplified theme
","Epic action, glorious 3D and Chris Helmsworth's rapturous good looks make for a gratifying but hardly epiphanic outing for the first God in a crowded superhero genre. Thor is a good action movie. The battles are grandiose and the pace and intensity of action never flags. Ashley Miller's screenplay is family friendly and the characters are as cookie- cutter as they come, with the possible exception of Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The special effects are cool and the different planets sufficiently spectacular.That said, Thor's kaleidoscopic production values could have done better with a less monochromatic storyline, and more believable acting. Despite his highs and pitfalls, Thor's character remains too much of a knight in shining armor. Perhaps a little more fallibility could have made the character more endearing. In short, Thor is an entertaining action-packed spectacle, but disappointing if you expect anything more.",7,2,6,3 May 2011
