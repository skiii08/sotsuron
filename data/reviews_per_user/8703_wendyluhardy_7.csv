The King's Speech," a great movie
","I'm a fan of movies about real people & events, & I think I would have accidentally overlooked 'The King's Speech' if my parents hadn't mentioned reading a review in the local paper, where a critic had given it an 'A-minus.' That was good enough for me, so I saw it today in a crowded theater and was not disappointed. 'The King's Speech' is definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year (and I go to about 30-40 movies a year).I read about King George VI's speech problems but that's not what the movie is about. It's about facing your fears, especially in your darkest hours--and it's okay if you need (and seek) a little help. Prince Albert (Firth) was put into a difficult situation; he was a happily married family man/naval officer and totally unprepared for the role that fell to him in December 1936 when his brother, Edward VIII, abdicates the throne to marry a twice-divorced American woman. Albert had been taking speech therapy from Lionel Logue (Rush) for a while before becoming king & after he was crowned, Britian got involved in WWII and King George VI had to make lots of speeches (via radio) to bolster his subjects. Logue was with him all the way, yet no one ever knew.Great performances all around by Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, and Helena Bonham-Carter. Guy Pearce (one of my favorite actors) played Edward VIII (he didn't look as wimpy as Edward but he definitely appeared as flaky) and I wonder how many young people know (if they see this movie) that the oldest of the king's 2 daughters is now Queen Elizabeth II? Anyway, don't take my word for it. See 'The King's Speech' and decide for yourself!",Null,2,4,25 December 2010
Passengers," Not bad at all
","I try to go to a movie on federal holidays, sort of my own way to celebrate. I used to do this for a long time except for the last few years because there really hasn't been anything out there I want to see--even at the $2.25 theater. But a girlfriend & I decided to take a chance on this movie on New Year's Day. Had to pay $12 because the only showing that fitted into our schedules was 3-D, which really irritated me. Never again! Anyway, 'Passengers' was not a bad movie. I felt really bad for Chris Pratt & prayed Jennifer Lawrence wouldn't find out why she 'woke up' ahead of schedule. You can't blame her for being furious! This was a good movie, though, and I only wish I had waited until it came to the cheap theater. I don't feel as if I've wasted a bunch of money if I don't like the movie (plus I can wander the hallway and find another movie to watch so my $2.25 isn't totally wasted).",7,1,3,19 January 2017
Barry Lyndon," Saw Barry Lyndon in 1975 and still love it
","When I was a senior in HS a friend & I saw this movie in 1976--a stretch for me, as I've never been a fan of either Stanley Kubrick or Ryan O'Neal. But this movie blew me away--the story line, cinematography, scenery, narration, costumes, acting, everything was just wonderful. There was a lot of publicity building up to the movie because Kubrick was using Marisa Berenson, a top model with little to no acting experience, who did a terrific job as Lady Lyndon. Ryan O'Neal was also pretty good, his Irish accent wasn't too bad.For some reason, Barry Lyndon was rarely shown on TV & I had to buy the DVD so I could watch it a few times a year. I'm amazed at the number of people who have never even heard of this movie; I recommend it whenever the subject of movies comes up.",10,3,5,30 October 2017
Dunkirk," This movie could have waited for Red Box
","I had been waiting to see 'Dunkirk' for months & planned on seeing it on 21 July, the opening night. Rarely does Hollywood put out a movie that I'm willing to see right away, but 'Dunkirk' looked like a fantastic movie.What a letdown; I was so disappointed. The trailers made it look so exciting. I mean, how could it be otherwise? The Battle of Dunkirk was perfect movie material: in the spring of 1940, over 300,000 British & French soldiers were trapped on the beaches around Dunkirk, making them sitting ducks for the Germans. The British military called for civilians w/boats to sail across the English Channel to Dunkirk to pick up as many men as possible & bring them to larger ships, as the larger ships could not make it to the beach- -and they succeeded. Surely an event worthy of a movie on a grand scale.Unfortunately, the trailers showed the best parts of the movie; everything else was a letdown. Not a lot of dialogue (which could barely be heard above the background noise) and little to no character development, which I consider essential to any movie. I swear Kenneth Branagh--one of the best actors in the world--did not have more than a few lines. Neither did Cillian Murphy or Tom Hardy, both great actors. Only Mark Rylance had a decent speaking part. There was not an opportunity to get to know the characters in the movie, what kind of men they were or personalities they had, what they might be thinking or feeling in their horrendous situation. Nolan never gives you a chance because it's the focus of the movie seems to be everything but the characters themselves.And the film was disjointed & lacked continuity. Of course all aspects of the battle had to be shown: from the air, from the sea, from the land, so jumping from Mark Rylance in his boat to Tom Hardy in his fighter/bomber and Fionn Whitehead on the beach was necessary. BUT you couldn't always tell when anything was happening. At one point it was nighttime at Dunkirk; you could see the fires & the lights on the beach. Then you'd see Tom Hardy in his plane or Mark Rylance on his boat--in broad daylight. Why? What time of the day was it? I thought it was night. If it's nighttime on Dunkirk then it's nighttime in the air & on the Channel, but we never see that. The events seemed out of order.Chris Nolan is a good director, but he could have done so much more. There should have been more character development so you could get to know these men better & empathize w/them & their situation, thereby becoming more involved in the movie. But he did not do that.My mom had wanted to see this movie (she's almost 80 & hasn't been to a movie in years). I told her to wait until it comes to Red Box and watch it. I mean, it's not a bad movie; just not as good as it should have been. It's not so much a war movie as it is Chris Nolan's version of a war movie.",9,8,18,24 July 2017
The Man Who Would Be King," Another overlooked yet terrific movie from 1975
","Saw quite a few movies in early 1976 and two of them stand out even after all these years: one is Barry Lyndon and the other is The Man Who Would Be King. So many people haven't heard of these films and I always recommend them. John Huston had been wanting to make this movie for years but wasn't able to until the 1970s. I think it was worth it, because he picked a great cast.It takes a while to get into The Man Who Would Be King, but once you're in, you're hooked. Danny & Peachy (brilliantly portrayed by Sean Connery & Michael Caine) are a couple of hell-raisers, stationed in India as part of the Queen's forces. They've done everything imaginable and are longing for a new adventure. They hear about a remote land beyond the mountains where no white man has gone since Alexander the Great. After almost killing themselves getting to this little place, they finally arrive--and, through a series of coincidences, Danny is crowned king. Who is he to tell the natives that they made a mistake? Danny & Peachy have a great time as the king & his consort (so to speak) until the natives find out that they've been hoodwinked; Danny is a mere mortal like everyone else. And they aren't too happy.I had to purchase the DVD because TV hardly ever showed this movie. But it's worth the price. John Huston directs a wonderful adventure story that stands the test of time.",10,1,5,30 October 2017
Downfall," What a fantastic movie!
","I never even heard of 'Downfall' before, guess it played in very few American theaters. It was on Netflix a few months ago, I was wondering if I should even bother with it, looked up the trailer on YouTube, thought it was worth my while & sat down with a bowl of popcorn. I was blown away by this movie, everything about it was great, even though the people around Hitler weren't readily identified (such as in 'The Longest Day,' another great film), you could pick out Josef & Magda Goebbels, Henrich Himmler, Eva Braun. It's like you, the audience, is there in the bunker with Hitler, watching/listening to him rant & rave to his generals. I would have loved to have seen what life was really like during the last few weeks in Hitler's bunker, but 'Downfall' probably comes closer than any other movie. Bruno Ganz should have at least been nominated for an Oscar. The Academy blew it, though (not unusual).This amazing movie didn't get the publicity it deserved when it released. I have never cared for western or war movie genres but there are some exceptions and 'Downfall' is one of them. Other war movies I've enjoyed--just for the record--are 'Das Boot' (another great German film), 'Hacksaw Ridge,' 'Schlinder's List,' 'The Pianist,' 'Saving Private Ryan,' 'The Longest Day,' 'The Great Escape,' 'Valkyrie,' 'Conspiracy,' and 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' Haven't seen much beyond that (wait, does 'The Final Countdown' count?)Anyway, check out Downfall!",10,0,0,17 May 2018
Footloose," Give me the original!
","I can't believe I wasted $7.50 last night to see this horrendous remake of 'Footloose,' but I was desperate to see a movie and nothing good was playing at the $1.50 theater. Why can't Hollywood leave remakes alone? Are screenwriters nowadays that unoriginal? Even though I felt that the 1984 film had a lame script (and acting), I loved the score, dancing, and scenery and the movie remains one of my favorite 'guilty pleasures.' Dean Pitchford wrote this script, which is almost a carbon copy of the original movie. Most of the same songs were used but were 'updated.' The only big difference is that the two leads--Kenny and Julianna--can actually dance whereas Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer couldn't (or at least not much). I'm still fuming at wasting all my money last night and would have walked out if I had paid only $1.50. Sorry to be so harsh in this review but I was not impressed. But I do hope that a better 'dancing movie' comes along for Kenny and Julianna, because they are terrific dancers.",Null,3,5,22 October 2011
