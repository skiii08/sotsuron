Hereditary," Slow Burner but Enjoyable if Prepared
","I liked Hereditary for what it was. It's a bit 'arty' - the cinematography is great, exceptional in places. Acting is very good. The story is a bit of a slow burner, so if you listened to the hype of it being one of the most scary horrors made, you might be disappointed.Having said that, it is a different type of horror to the norm. It attempts to suck you in slowly with sweeping cameras and a slow but unrelenting tensity, aided by a subtle but menacing soundtrack. I liked that, it was different but for some, they might find it boring.It doesn't rely on your traditional jumps and sudden rise in audio that many other horrors do. If you want that, you'll probably not like this film too much.With that in mind, give it a go. Let it take you in and on its journey. It'll not be a particularly fast one, but it'll be different.",7,1,2,24 August 2018
The Lion King," Could have been amazing
","The animation is enough to carry this film. It is truly quite amazing. But the film is a little flat and here's why:
1, Voice acting is monotone, forced and devoid of genuine emotion (except Seth Rogen).
2. Though the animation in general was amazing, there was a lack of emotion on the faces and in the eyes of the characters. It's a bit like those shows where it's real animal footage with human voices.
3. Lack of humour.
4. Music was a bit boring.Could have been amazing with a bit more effort.",5,1,1,10 October 2019
Midsommar," A little different
",This movie does require a little thinking outside the box to make it work. It's certainly not a horror in the traditional sense. Try and put yourself in the mind of the characters and it'll work. Brilliant.,8,1,4,28 December 2019
Black Panther," What Did I Just Watch?
","Talk about over-hyped. 
1. Boring story - relentless boring banter between characters. Typical story that's been told a million times. Nothing wrong with that as such, but equally, doesn't add to the experience.
2. Bad acting - acting was wooden (with the exception of Forest Whitaker). Felt like you were watching a live amateur play where the characters are reading live from a script.
3. Boring action - if you can manage to put up with the boring dialogue, then there's little to gain from the action. Very average at best, something you would expect in a TV episode.
4. CGI - the CGI effects are something along the lines of a good TV series, not really up there with a top movie production.To Sum UpDue to the wooden acting, the movie lacks passion. With the predictable non-exciting story and the action and CGI being average, Black Panther is simply dull and boring.",2,212,420,4 May 2018
