Vertigo," A classic thriller that is cerebrally captivating from start to finish
","While there are films about how the meaning of true love is defined by lovers truly being able to accept each other, despite their mistakes a la 'Sunrise,' there are films that venture into territory that deals with how we think we have the answers in our hearts, until we find out that we've chosen to travel a narrow, linear path, when we could have thought more rationally outside of our own heads and realized we could have built more bridges to act as a 'safety net.'Does this obsession mean we're isolating ourselves within our own subjective opinions and does it make us a bad person if we feel our instincts will lead to somewhere, or does it mean we're naive? All I know is that 'Vertigo' manages to tell a side of humanity, in that we are all susceptible to becoming vulnerable in the general sense. We may have our strengths, but we will always have our weaknesses.Is there a lesson to be learned by any of this or do we just have to learn to live with this knowing that this type of ambivalence cannot be prevented all the time? Does 'Vertigo' answer any of this? I do not know if it does, but maybe you the viewer will think otherwise. Whatever you may be thinking about, 'Vertigo' is a film that every film lover should see. 'Vertigo' to me is a thriller that is very psychological in that it made me question a side of our humanity that plays a part in our interactions with people. Any story that can captivate me to a level beyond just being entertained for the sake of entertainment is the type of story I would definitely want to revisit again and again.",10,4,9,27 May 2013
Casablanca," Heartwarming in all the right places, Casablanca deserves every ounce of its iconic status in the world of cinema
","As a child, I fondly remember watching the a Looney Tunes short which was a homage/parody to Casablanca, named Carrotblanca. I didn't think much of it, but it greatly gave me an idea of how iconic Casablanca was and knowing of Humphrey Bogart. Fast-forward to adulthood and now I've finally watched it and seen what the fuss was about.Did it live up to the hype? I think so, but as I was watching it, I was starting to think I might not really like the movie by the time it ends. When things were getting too sentimental, my cynical side was cringing, but then once the story opened up more, I began to see that the story was addressing themes of love and virtue that we all can relate to as human beings. It's the two things that make a human being human and we as human beings know that those two things may require things of importance of us to be sacrificed and that can be either good or negative. It's a character study of one person's struggle with those two ideals.What I love about Casablanca is that it is not at all cynical, but at the same time it's not all sunshine and rainbows. What it does have, most importantly, is a lot of heart and it is a film that can remind us all of our humanity in that we're all susceptible to our vulnerabilities to the people we cherish the most and that could potentially destroy us, but Casablanca finds triumph in that and asks each and everyone of us to find triumph in our adversities for the sake of keeping our hearts pure. Any film that asks something like that is a film that is sure to be remembered and to remain in the hearts of not only people looking for entertainment in movies, but also heart. And that is what makes Casablanca a pure classic, in my opinion.",8,1,2,19 July 2013
Chinatown," As little as possible....
","What I love about movies that come from the New Hollywood genres is their quality of elegance that make these pictures into something special that cannot be captured ever again. Whether it is the clean look in the visuals or its technique of not going with all the bare details in story or its characters.That certain mystique is especially captured so beautifully in 'Chinatown.' It's a story that pulls you into a big mystery, but ultimately it feels like the town is full of mysteries. One thing I have to say I love is the effectiveness of the title, in that after watching the movie it finally takes on the true colors of what the movie is about and really gives meaning to what is disturbing about what I just witnessed on screen.And I'll leave it at that. I could go on about the acting performances that really give strength to the film. All I could say is that the collaborative effort of the creation of the story, its characters and its atmosphere all culminate in creating a movie that is truly dark and brooding. It's basically a movie that will stick with you. This is probably a horrible review, but I guess I just want to let anyone know who might read this that this is a classic.",10,1,2,16 May 2013
Se7en," Se7en is a beautiful film and worth watching. I agree with both parts.
","Getting into the film noir genre was probably one of the best things I've done for myself as a person who loves film. Deep, moody stories all the while being stylish and evoking a despondent atmosphere are definitely my type of movies. Movies that ask important questions of us dealing with our humanity or depicting the ugliest parts of the human psyche that is disturbingly relevant to our modern society shows that movies are more than just mere entertainment. This is everything that makes Se7en a great movie, in my opinion.I could go on and on about the film, but first I have got to talk about the atmosphere that makes the movie so effective in many ways. It is just pure grit and grime and I love the film's consistency in its tone. Not just through its sets, but also the color tones that were used to enhance every scene makes each scene moody and ominous. These aesthetics definitely make for a lot of great cinematography and there is quite a number of memorable shots in the film. A key scene for me would be all the scenes taking place in the library, which are definitely some of the most beautiful cinematography I have seen in film thus far.What also makes Se7en stand on its two feet are definitely great performances from Morgan Freeman who makes each movie I've seen him in have depth and character. While Freeman delivered a performance to compliment the film's story, Kevin Spacey was definitely the one to steal the show. To deliver such a disturbing performance that elicits just as much fear as watching Hannibal Lecter on screen was a feat that I didn't even know could be accomplished. I was holding my breath in every scene he spoke to another character. He was that captivating in his acting performance.I don't know what else to say without spoiling this great movie, other than that anyone who is a fan of the noir genre or just a person who enjoys a good story should definitely watch Se7en. The film is so good that I had to include this on my personal list of my top favorite movies of all time. A pure classic in every way.",10,1,2,22 July 2013
The Big Lebowski," For once, a movie that feels like real life
","What I think makes 'The Big Lebowski' so great is its attitude and outlook on life and how it can easily resonate with people, especially with a non-confrontational attitude like 'The Dude.' In a world where we try to over-rationalize everything until we don't realize we're creating an altogether new problem which is a byproduct of an already existing issue, 'The Dude' makes everyone else look like a cartoon character or a caricature. To quote what the cowboy said which is basically we all need a hero for its time and place, or I don't know, I kinda forgot what he said. Umm.. Something to that effect.What makes the movie great is you see this guy who gets placed in this sticky situation and how he gets tangled up with all these characters being the opposite with the obvious, Walter, who happens to be his buddy. To see these characters tick is just plain hilarious. And what is also great is watching The Dude just floating through every conversation and every conflict inadvertently making almost everyone else out to be taking themselves too seriously. I did not see the point about the film the first time due to being delirious from working, but upon my second viewing of the film, I found it funny in a way that resonated with my outlook on life.I think we all yearn to be stoic in the same manner as The Dude, especially in a world in which a lot of people have their head stuck up their asses. To take no bullshit without feeling the need to protect a huge ego is an attribute that everyone should try to aspire to. 'The Big Lebowski' to me is not only a great comedy, but a great film that feels so human and I cannot help but smile with laughter and feel a sense of warmth from watching it. When there are so many characters in movies that feel like they are from an unattainable fantasy dream, we cannot help but alienated from them, and to have a film like 'The Big Lebowski' to bring these characters back down to a human level makes a movie that feels like real life, and at its core, is what makes this film a classic and a film that has a home in my heart forever.",10,1,3,28 May 2013
Citizen Kane," Classic
","A movie of epic proportions is how I would describe Citizen Kane. I have watched this film a couple of times, expecting not to like it as much as I would. Being a movie that gets a lot of hype with its title as 'the greatest movie of all time,' I can clearly see why. Is it the greatest of movie of all time? I don't know and that is up to your opinion, but all I can say is that I try not to watch films with those impressions influencing my expectations. Although what I can say is that I greatly appreciate this film and I can accept the praise and I feel it is one of the best films I have ever watched.Despite being from the 40's, this movie somehow feels fresh to me, even today in this day and age! The way that this story is told feels so intrinsic. The movie begins with an introduction of the whole story that really took me off guard at first, but then I realized it didn't tell the human aspects of the story that was to follow and this is one of the most unique introductions in a movie I have ever seen. You think you know the whole story from this mini-documentary styled intro, but this is still a jigsaw puzzle that still needs to be solved by the people who know Kane personally to fill in most of the blanks, especially the mystery of 'Rosebud.' Kane was a powerful figure, but a character who also had a sense of humanity and through this, it's easy to feel a connection to Kane. As we delve into the human aspect of the film, we become more and more immersed with the story and it is a very human story, in my opinion. This to me is what makes the movie effective.And what also astounds about the story is that it feels complete and it did not need to have anything else added to enhance or add further drama to the story. You would think a movie that tries to tell a story of a man's life young to old would feel rushed, but at this running time, it feels like you know the guy! Never have I seen such character development this good and fleshed out on film. And to top it all off, the makeup looks very realistic, along with Orson Welle's acting, which perfectly pulls it off for his different ages throughout the movie.And that is only a few of the great aspects of this film. The great cinematography techniques in the movie have definitely made me more analytical and aware of these intricacies in film. Not only is the story filled with ambition, but you can see it in the beautiful visuals. From Kane's huge, but sparse mansion to scenes utilizing chiaroscuro, you can see the influence it had on films today. From starring and also directing this film, you can see from watching the film the amount of ambition that Orson Welles poured out into this epic.After watching Citizen Kane, I cannot help but feel like there has been a transition from me being a casual movie watcher to a serious film buff. With its simple, but grandiose story, its breathtaking visuals and even the music that perfectly compliments every scene, this movie has become a timeless beauty that ages like fine wine.",10,3,4,11 March 2013
Memento," Is ignorance truly bliss?
","The first time I watched Pulp Fiction, it took me a bit of time to fully grasp its nonlinear storytelling by trying to figure out when each event occurred to be able to know the occurrence of events chronologically. Now having watched Memento, I have come to realize that despite Pulp Fiction's unique narrative, Tarantino made a story that is still easy to grasp.At first I didn't get the memo that Memento presents its story in reverse chronological order, and having figured that out in a few scenes in, it felt like I was falling behind in a race, struggling to catch up. And not only that, but the flashbacks scenes are shown in regular chronological order to make the pace even more insanely hectic for me. I think it is safe to say that everyone can benefit from watching this movie more than once to piece everything together, if one loses track the first time watching it. My first viewing, to say the least, was mindboggling, but thanks to subtitles and having a bit of patience with my second viewing, I managed to tie up a lot of loose ends that were beginning to drive me crazy.And that's one of the things that makes Nolan such a talented director. When you watch Memento, you have to literally change the way you watch movies to grasp it. It is not a stylistic choice just for the sake of being innovative. Nolan utilizes this reverse storytelling technique to execute the drama in a very unique way, having the same effect as putting a puzzle together to know what the full picture looks like. As we go back into the past, that is when we discover the answer to the mysteries of what is really going on underneath it all, as opposed to a conventional movie where we get the bigger picture of the situation as the story progresses in regular chronological order, followed by a conclusion. Whereas the ending of Pulp Fiction occurs during the middle of all the chaos, we get our true conclusion to Memento at the beginning where everything started. Whereas we know the destiny of every character with Pulp Fiction, there is a bit of uncertainty as to what will happen next for the protagonist.What I love about Memento is that it perfectly encapsulates the strange feeling of deja vu. While the protagonist is unaware of everything that happens to him, we the viewer begin to see the full picture in the last scene in the movie and we come to a shocking revelation of the events we just witnessed. I don't want to elaborate more and run the risk of potentially spoiling anything, but all I can say is that this is one of the most innovative mystery thrillers concocted by Nolan, and the subtle film noir influences gives it an extra charm. Watching this movie, you wouldn't predict he would he even direct the batman movies and that shows not only Nolan's diversity but also his versatility as a director.",10,1,3,19 May 2013
12 Angry Men," A tug-of-war battle between morality and rationalization
","It's amazing how 12 Angry Men can make other movies seem gimmicky having to rely on props or set pieces to make the audience feel immersed only to feel let down in the end. And that is due largely in part to its acting performances. Never would I have thought I would ever feel tension just from the use of dialogue, but '12 Angry Men' proved me wrong showing that if you have a good plot and a good script, then you can make a quality film without the use of large sets, car chases, gun shots, and beautiful scenery shots.There was never one moment in this film where I was not paying attention. One reason I can give for this is the distinctiveness of each and every character. What I love is how every juror is different from one another hailing from many different backgrounds. Just listening to these guys talk made me want to get to know everyone of them and what their motives were and how it would affect the outcome of the story. As the story progresses, you get more and more immersed as things start to get tense and personal in situation in which extreme rationalization is required in using reasonable doubt.What also makes this film rewarding is that you feel like one of the jurors and it makes you want to think just as hard as they're thinking about the case. There are twists and turns here and this is not a simple case to analyze when everything is not pure black and white. When we're only presented with very few details, we can only look to the unseen details that could give us a strong reason to doubt a person(s)' accusations. This is a story that is universal and how reasonable doubt must be taken into all accounts when there is blurred line between who is right or wrong and who is good or bad.",9,0,0,21 May 2013
Taxi Driver," Classic
","First of all, Robert De Niro's performance as Travis Bickle blew me away. His portrayal of how loneliness and alienation can affect one's outlook on life is believable. An average happy person may think a person like Bickle is crazy, but this character is so relateable in so many aspects. From his tired voice to his emotionless eyes, it really gives a good view of how isolation in his life has worn him down. When you are isolated and alone, one has more time to develop a philosophy on different things, but at the same time boredom and redundancy can really take a toll on a person's mind. Everything about his portrayal of this character is iconic and memorable.As a taxi driver, we see the world from Travis's eyes. As the film progresses, Travis becomes more and more engrossed in changing things around in the city, as we see him being immersed in the ugliness of the criminal underworld and how much of the city is infested with it. This psychologically affects Travis more into becoming radical and it seems to be offset after Travis fails to develop a sense of normalcy with social relationships and trying to connect to someone. And as a human being, what is astounding to me, is that I could relate to all of this.This is an intense film and what further builds upon this is the soundtrack. The use of jazz music really helps to enhance the looming atmosphere of the film. The down beat jazz music really contrasts well with the more ominous music, and what makes it really work is that it perfectly compliments Travis Bickle as a character of contradictions. While some could argue that Travis Bickle is enigmatic, I think the same could be said about everyone else. Aren't we all an enigma to some degree? I think so.Overall, this is a great film with a great story that in my opinion makes a big statement. The meaning of what I inherited from all of this is that sometimes we as human beings want to make some sort of statement, but the limited ability of words can sometimes not be enough to express what's eating us away deep down inside.What Taxi Driver does is not doing what other movies do and that's creating a 'realistic' view of the world with a dash of fantasy. Happy endings and getting the girl are a big hit and miss in the real world, as cynical as that may sound, and what Taxi Driver does is not only tell a really great story that is bound to make you think, but a really great story that is completely human.",10,0,0,26 February 2011
The Godfather: Part II," Malevelontly chilling
","In ways, I guess I could say that the first Godfather changed my outlook on film, in that you can enjoy movies for their artistic aspects, and that you don't necessarily have to understand the film inside out, in that you can enjoy for what it offers, and that is basically the experience of it. When I watch a gangster movie, I felt that the element of brutality was something that was lacking in the first Godfather, in that it came off too pretty and sophisticated, but I actually came to appreciate its dynamics in that the brutal scenes come as the plot escalates in that it serves as a contrast to the more sombre, melancholic elements of the film. I have to say that it brought forth something unique with that concept and gave the film a sense of grandeur that made it stick out in the crime genre.And the things The Godfather did in setting the bar, Part II further expands on its ideas and opts for a darker, malevolent approach that greatly differs from the first film that has more of a sense of warmth. To see Michael's transformation was astounding in the first film, but to see what he has become is gutwrenchingly heavy. What Don Vito Corleone created was a foundation for his family, and to see Michael become corrupted to the point, he would do anything to stay at the top is horrifyingly disturbing. What makes this performance so intense is the lack of any human emotion or empathy coming from Michael, that makes him just pure evil. What is brought to this role is the stuff of legends and I cannot give enough credit to Al Pacino. He deserves every amount praise bestowed upon him, but who I think shines just as much as Al in the film is Robert De Niro and his portrayal of a young Vito Corleone during his rise to power. I would have never thought it would feel natural to have someone other than Marlon Brando portray the original Don, but Robert De Niro actually exceeded my expectations. From his accent to his mannerisms, he got the character down to a hair.And not only with great performances, we are offered a great character study contrasting a father and son, and what drives these men to kill. We know how Michael came into his position, but as the film progresses we begin to see how Vito and Michael handle their business, as we see both their stories reach a conclusion that is downright brutal. The Godfather Part II shows what is set forth by Michael's rise to power and the movie retains its ambition, but becomes its own film that is gripping and memorable in its own unique character.I originally preferred the first one, but then I realized how much the second one is dependent on the first film. While the second one is more gripping, the first one is grandiose in that it was the first to bring out these great ideas and execute them in a way that is incomparable, but I like to see the first and the second as one long epic story in that it depicts the rise and fall of an empire and while I prefer the first one, the sequel does something different, adding different angles to the story that are equally as compelling, dramatic and shocking as the first one. To make a sequel that does just that was no easy feat and this is the mark of Francis Ford Coppola's talent as a director. Even if the first Godfather were to never have a sequel, it would still be awesome on its own, but to have a sequel that is this good is more than anyone could ask for from a great director. The Godfather Part II is a film that you should definitely not miss out on.",10,1,3,30 May 2013
Fargo," Cold, Sterile and Morbid
","I really don't know what from the film the Coen brothers claim is true or could be juxtaposed with actual happenings or actual people, but to comprehend that really does not take away from Fargo being a great movie, whether how true or fictitious it is. When a financially troubled car salesman hires and makes a deal with two people to kidnap his wife as a ruse to get his wealthy father-in-law to cough up money, you can already predict that something could go wrong, especially when these two people aren't the most professional.While the movie can be oddly humorous, it really adds a strange dynamic effect when coupled with its winter setting, in that it gives a sense of desolation that is reflected in Jerry Lundegaard's life and really adds a lot more weight to the morbidity that carries on and escalates throughout the beginning of the film to the end. Fargo feels like a very morbid movie to me, but to add in some of the most quirky humor really makes the movie feel very idiosyncratic in that it seems incomparable to other films, with all of its distinct characters and its very strange, cold and sterile atmosphere. While Pulp Fiction does do a good job of combining humor and morbidity, I think I have come to favor Fargo a lot more.What I love about Fargo is how distinct every major character is in the movie. The writing that went into him, coupled with each actor being able to breathe life into their character and giving them their own unique quirks was one of the things that kept me glued to the screen. From the mild mannered behaviors to the Minnesota accents, the characters come off very authentic in presenting a very regional film. If I would have to give a nod to any one performance in the film, it would have to be Frances McDormand. From her mild mannerisms to her unintentional humor, Marge was the foundation of the story and McDormand further accentuated that with her superb acting in that she makes her portrayal feel so authentic to its region, believable and at the utmost, human. To witness all the events in the film and to react the way she did is commendable, to say the least and I think that Marge Gunderson has got to be one of the coolest female characters on film that I have witnessed and I cannot praise the Coen brothers enough for writing such a great non-stereotypical female character.Fargo may be a simple story, but I think that it's simplicity is what I really love about this film. I watched enough films from the Coen brothers to deem them as very unique in their style of telling stories that feels so different from other directors. Fargo basically sealed the deal for me. With its unique characteristics, it feels very surreal in a morbid sense. I have never described a film that way and I think that shows how special this film is. If you want to watch a film that has character, then watch 'Fargo,' because it definitely has a whole bunch of that.",10,0,0,20 June 2013
The Thing," A Nightmare in Antarctica
","What induces the most horror? Many different people will offer many different answers to this simple yet profound question. One of my strongest fears would stem from isolation. Not having any source of protection for myself would be a nightmare, but what I am trying to say is that I think the strongest stimuli of fear would be anything that triggers our vulnerability as human beings. I personally love to watch horror films not only for the thrill of the scare, but for its atmosphere for I feel it plays just as big of an influence on our senses just as much the plot.That isolated atmosphere plays a strong role in triggering a feeling of dread in obvious films being Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (my personal favorite horror film) and Ridley Scott's Alien. Both are able to utilize this idea, but in ways that are each unique to its own story, and that could very well be said about the remake of 'The Thing.' In comparison to 'Alien,' it has that element of science fiction, but it not only gives a feeling of doom in its environment, but it also manages to evoke feelings of paranoia through the characters. While 'Alien' and 'The Shining' feel isolated, you also feel a sense of possible danger from anyone of the characters featured in and that is where that feeling of vulnerability is triggered while watching 'The Thing.' While in other horror movies, we may know who or what we're running from, but it seems in 'The Thing,' we lack that awareness and there is no place to escape.This is a bleak film that will leave its mark on you that will get under your skin. There are grotesque moments, but the fascinating thing about it is that it uses no flashy CGI effects and the realism makes everything from the blood and gore really shock inducing. I would also like to add that the look of the alien monster is just as grotesque and manages to instill fear. While the alien in 'Alien' is horrifying, the creature in 'The Thing' is a much more rabid beast that will brutally kill anything to adapt. The scary thing about the 'thing' as compared to the alien from 'Alien' is it possesses no emotion and that is what gives these creatures the edge over humans.I cannot recommend this film enough to fans or the horror genre. It is definitely a must see, not only for it being scary, but also utilizing the feeling of fear in its own unique way with its acting performances, set pieces, choreography, designs, and especially its story. If you are looking for a horror film that is memorable, then do yourself a favor and watch 'The Thing.'",8,0,1,21 May 2013
The Shining," Cabin Fever Blues
","What I love about Stanley Kubrick is how he can intensely captivate me like no other director. There is a certain intensity to his movies that is so hypnotic in that it holds my attention so much that I find myself trying not to blink in order to catch every detail. Within every shot, there is a lot of attention to detail and from the films I have seen from Kubrick, he seems very meticulous about the visual details and he is so clever how he can make little things add to that disturbing intensity. These little things make Kubrick's films feel otherworldly and grandiose, which is definitely a bit of how I would describe some details about 'The Shining.' I knew who Kubrick was, but during the time that I first randomly watched 'The Shining' on television as a teenager, I was completely unaware that he actually directed it. All I knew after having watched it for the first time was that I was mesmerized by it. I had a thing for horror flicks, but this was the first horror film that I truly loved and the more I watched it on AMC, the more I discovered more nuances that made the movie even more disturbing. What made me love this movie was the fact that for the first time ever, I was actually analyzing a horror film.It made an impact on me in that it brought out my worst fears, and that would be the paranoid feeling of isolation. Where most horror today only manages to startle, The Shining manages to actually disturb and that to me feels more effective in making me feel a sense of dread, and how Kubrick executes that is astounding. Whether it be imagery that is just straight up odd, or its cold, lonely atmosphere, all these scenes are capable of evoking some type of reaction from anyone who would watch this film. What really resonated with me were the long drawn out scenes of dialogue between the characters and knowing from listening to their tone, that something did not quite feel right and this is executed so well by Kubrick. The decision to film close-ups of the actors' faces added an even greater emotional effect that adds to the disturbing anxiety permeating the film.I don't know what else to say about The Shining, but after watching A Clockwork Orange and 2001, I have come to respect Stanley Kubrick as a director more than ever. He has a style that feels distinct, but at the same time he is versatile in ways I didn't even know of. I wouldn't be able to name my favorite director, but Kubrick is definitely one of the top contenders for that title. Mr. Kubrick not only a great horror film, but one that is memorable in ways that it manages to leave a disturbing impression on you permanently. I will never forget the first time I watched 'The Shining,' and although it probably might not scare me as much the next time I will put this on, I will always be able to enjoy being disturbed by it.",10,0,2,27 May 2013
Apocalypse Now," The End
","With a movie like Apocalypse Now, the ambiguity in its approach may be offsetting to some, but in my opinion, when a story is ambiguous and the lines are blurred on who is the 'good guy' and the 'bad guy,' I feel a stronger human connection to the story and the characters, despite their flaws in morality, because that is what real life is truly like. It's not necessarily about letting the so-called 'good' triumph over 'evil.' Sometimes, the main question is is it even necessary? Perhaps, sometimes we are no different from the villains.Without spoiling anything, Apocalypse Now is a story about our human psyche and how it can easily become corrupted by the tragedy of violence. Whether our spirits can become pure again is a question to ponder. And how these points are born from the story being told shows that Apocalypse Now is more than just about war, but about our war with our own humanity. Whether it means to do the right thing or to find some sort of redemption from the wrongdoings of our past, we are all searching for something just like Willard traveling down the Nung River.As we keep searching, will it take us to our breaking point? Will it kill us or will we rise above it and reach that destination we have been searching our whole lives for? These are only a few of the questions that this film has brought to my attention and I assume many who watch this film will pick up something different from it, as the story is wide open to many different interpretations.With its heavy hallucinogenic atmosphere, Apocalypse Now seems to evoke a very spiritual feel. It's cinematography shows the beauty of nature being contrasted with the ugliness of man-made destruction. The scenes where it's tranquil and slow really immerse you into the movie and as the movie becomes more despondent in its tone, the use of chiaroscuro becomes more evident. I cannot find the right words to do justice as to how much this film is a beautiful piece of art, not only in its story and its characters, but also in its visual aesthetics.To sum things up to the point, 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that differs from many straight-forward Hollywood movies, in that one can develop many conclusions, due to its very subtle nature in its story. It may sound like a simple story at first, but upon multiple viewings, you will find there are many layers beneath the surface. Apocalypse Now is more than just about Captain Willard trying to accomplish his assigned mission, but also about him questioning what HIS real mission really is underneath it all. It will make you, the viewer question that just as much as I question what my own objective in life is and whether it is even attainable. Philosophical ramblings aside, 'Apocalypse Now' is a stone cold classic and it is one of the best movies of all time.",10,0,2,16 May 2013
Spirited Away," The Best Fairy Tale Ever
","'Spirited Away' was a mere random movie I rented on a whim sometime during my days in middle school and the experience of watching it during that period of my life makes this one of my most sentimental films in which I dearly hold in my heart. Not knowing what to expect, my only assumption was that this looked like it could be a good movie, since I was getting a bit into anime/manga and anything that was a cartoon appealed to me more at the time, but what I got was something more. What I took away from this was an strange epic fairytale like no other. With so much memorable imagery, coupled with an atmosphere of mystery, this is one of those stories that manage to stick with you.While my youth offered more of a sense of alienation than friendship at the time, it felt like this movie was there for me. Things have gotten a bit better externally, but if I were to talk about the highlights of my youth, it would definitely be times like this in which I made random discoveries where I was able to find unexpected comfort during those times where it felt hard for me in a world that wasn't exactly as bad as the real world I didn't even know of, until now. I will always hold this film dear in my heart, but this is definitely a film I look forward to revisiting again.With its dreamy feel, the film holds so much surreal beauty while retaining all of its pure emotion. 'Spirited Away' to me feels like a milestone in the genre of animated films. What 'Spirited Away' proved is that you can convey so much through animation just as much as a live action film, and I would dare say it has gone places not a lot of live action films have even treaded on. The film immersed me into its animated world like no other animated film. 'Spirited Away' is not only a great anime film, but one of the greatest films in general.",10,0,1,20 June 2013
No Country for Old Men," A Look into an Abyss
","I expect a film like 'No Country for Old Men' to be polarizing for some, especially if they're expecting a big finale with the good guy and the bad guy drawing their guns in the end to settle the score. 'No Country for Old Men' is a film that dabbles more in existentialism, despite all the crime that occurs. Basically, what I'm saying is that the film adapted from the novel is very unconventional not only for its genre, but also in its approach to storytelling. What the Coen brothers do best is combining altogether different elements and creating something with its own unique character. While there are subtle throwbacks to the old wild west, the story takes place in modern society where technology has advanced, society has advanced and unfortunately crime has too.What are Anton Chigurh's true motives? Does he have a philosophical doctrine that we the audience are unaware of or are just unable to comprehend? What Anton does is create a lot of questions that arise from his actions and his interactions with the other characters. To watch a character as odd as him is fascinating and I cannot give enough credit to Javier Bardem in portraying such a character that is so enigmatic and just his presence alone is able to evoke so much mystery. Even though Anton is very incomprehensive, it is all made up for by being able to be somehow captivated by him.How every character deals with Anton is interesting, to say the least and as the film progresses, the feeling of despondency increases gradually. The lack of heroes is what gives this film its sense of hopelessness and that feeling of hopelessness is basically set in stone from the first few shots coupled with Tommy Lee Jone's epic voice-over narration in introducing the story. It is the perfect introduction to what we will witness in the story and what it all means for a sheriff like him in comprehending these events. As the events occur, we the audience reflect on these situations just as much as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Tommy Lee Jones' performance in this role is impressive and is injected with a great sense of humanity. I commend his portrayal as Bell, in that he is the character who carries the weight of the story.The acting is a huge fragment in bringing this film to life, but what also does that is how the visuals are executed and it is definitely utilized to a great effect. From its majestic shots to its beautiful lighting and color tones, the Coen brothers set a mood that permeates the whole film. Its barren settings really add a feeling of desolation that is at the same time hypnotic and surreal. While the film can be suspenseful and its suspense is definitely executed perfectly, the film still somehow manages to maintain an air of mystique. The non-existence of a soundtrack really gives the film a feeling of loneliness, all the while adding an even greater sense of sterility to its already barren wasteland.I can go on and on about the great acting, its memorable shots and its great script, but what makes 'No Country' a great film is that it manages to be truly idiosyncratic in its execution just like how the Coen Brothers' other great films are. Even if a film like this leaves me more questions than answers, if it still manages to captivate me to a point that I'm willing to return to it, then that shows that it doesn't matter if I don't have any answers to my questions. There are only a few films that are able to pull this off naturally and 'No Country for Old Men' is definitely one of those special films that can do just that.",10,41,49,20 June 2013
Mulholland Drive," Mulholland Dr. is a fine example of a film created by a director with an idiosyncratic vision and style, and also a film of pure art.
","Words cannot do justice as to what I think about this film. It is like a puzzle that you can distinguish that all the pieces somehow fits together, but once put together, it still remains a mystery. There is more symbolism as opposed to a concrete meaning. This is a cerebral film that requires the viewer to be analytical, yet at the same time be open to many interpretations.That is the beauty of this film. This is art and while the film is really good, I'm still left pondering. I could imagine every viewer will arrive at a different interpretation and I feel David Lynch's intention while making this film was to encourage people to come up with their own explanations. This film is bound to leave one very puzzled upon their first viewing, but upon further analysis, there is a symbolic relationship that ties everything together. If you are still lost, I think the key thing to pay attention to is the cowboy. For some reason, that really helped me a lot in finding some sort of logical explanation for the events that occur in the film.While I really do not know if there is a moral presented (or a point), to me, this film represents the demons that people have in the back of their minds. It's the elephant in the room that people don't want to confront or how one becomes in denial of its existence and how there is a good way to do that, as well as a bad way, but either way it has to be confronted. That to me seems to be what this film spoke about. Coupled with a foreboding atmosphere and odd imagery, this is a disturbing piece of high quality cinema that is shrouded with an aura of mystery bound to leave an imprint on one's psyche. I would definitely watch this again not just to learn more about the world created in this film, but to also be immersed in it again. 5/5",10,18,28,6 December 2012
The Dark Knight," The Iconic Superhero film that not only sets the bar for its genre, but redefines it
","'The Dark Knight' is everything I wanted a Batman film to be and it has that level of darkness that a lot of superhero films just don't have. The story has a lot of depth. The cast is great. The way Nolan used Chicago as his Gotham made the film look larger than life. There is a sense of realism compared to pre-Nolan Batman films. I could go on and on, especially since Batman is my favorite superhero and that character played a huge role in my childhood whether it was the cartoons or the Burton/Schumacher films. People say that they had a problem with Christian Bale's Batman voice, but to me personally it doesn't take away from the film, because the essence of the character is still there.Heath Ledger's Joker in my opinion has a become an iconic villain of cinema. Unlike Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker, Heath Ledger's Joker will actually disturb you more than make you laugh. I always identified 'The Joker' with the animated series version voiced by Mark Hamill. That was the iconic Joker, but to have an actor being able to rise to that standard and reinvent a super villain was something I really did not expect before I even saw 'The Dark Knight.' And that is really evident especially when Batman and Joker are both on screen. Every interaction between them somehow brings back my memories of watching the animated series only this time its live action and its more mature and darker than I ever imagined my favorite superhero and supervillain to be.I could go on about the rest of the cast such as Michael Cane, Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart for their fantastic portrayal of the characters. Not only is this a fantastic superhero film, but this is also a fantastic piece of cinema. If I could ever go back in time to witness this film for the first time over and over again, I would just to feel the aura of excitement coming from me and everyone in the theater. I didn't know what to expect with 'The Dark Knight' just as much as I did not know what to expect with 'Batman Begins.' I was expecting a good ol' superhero story, but instead I was watching a reinvented Batman and a re-imagining of the story I always knew of the character.The old Batman films were fun for me as a child, but the rebooted franchise definitely inspired me to read the graphic novels that played a part in influencing Nolan's vision. Every scene is shockingly dark, captivating, but most importantly iconic and memorable and I sure hope that this film has a far reaching influence on other superhero films, because the film really set the bar for the genre. Every other superhero I will watch unfortunately will be compared to 'The Dark Knight' and it will be judged based on that film. These are the only superhero films of its kind and the fact that it stands out from the rest shows how much quality the film has and how much it gets right. 'The Dark Knight' is a classic in every sense of the word not just as a superhero film, but as a work of storytelling in general.",10,0,1,20 June 2013
2001: A Space Odyssey," A film that is wide in scope and the best word to describe it: Limitless
","This could definitely a very strong contender for the greatest movie of all time. Never before has a movie felt so grandiose and immersive. What I mean by grandiose is how there will be scenes (or suites) that allow the film to breathe. I could understand the complaints of how the movie can be really slow, but the thing to understand here is how these scenes bring out the atmosphere of space, whether it is its breathtaking beauty or its strong sense of deep isolation as we venture deeper into the unknown. These scenes are either soothing or tension-building.Not a lot of films can make techniques like this work so naturally, especially when what is marketed to the masses are fast moving, intense action films, but 2001: Space Odyssey redefines the science fiction in ways that still make it a groundbreaking achievement today.One example could be its depiction of highly advanced human technology. While the year 2001 in actuality was far from the technological advancements in the film, especially currently, it still invokes a sense of wonder of what we, the human race, are truly capable of and I think that is truly what this film sets out to do. With its depiction of human evolution, to me the point of this film is that there is truly no end to our self-discovery and we are far from grasping the universe and its mysteries. What this film is trying to say, in my opinion, is that this is still the beginning. 5/5",10,1,3,6 December 2012
Once Upon a Time in America," Expanding on the idea of showing the personal side of a gangster ala The Godfather, Once Upon a Time in America tells a story that is completely different and ambitious
","I am usually hesitant to sit through long movies, because not only does it require me to find the time, I question whether the story will be worth enough to hold my attention for that long. As long as the movie is good, then I can tolerate the length, but I have then never watched a movie as long as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and thought of it then was pretty daunting.And to my surprise, every scene in 'Once Upon a Time in America' was able to do just that all the while making me forget about its long length. Every performance by the actors is perfect, especially Robert De Niro performance as Noodles. The reason why this man is my favorite actor of all time is the way every performance he does is intense and brooding, but from different perspectives from completely different characters from different worlds.Here, he is a character that will make you sympathize with him and will also alienate you with disgust. Noodles is a fascinating character that makes me feel a lot of ambivalence. What is amazing is seeing the ugly world through the eyes of a gangster and seeing their flawed, but existing humanity. This is a bit reminiscent of The Godfather in that it shows the more personal side of a gangster's life, but this is a story that differs a lot of The Godfather and is a standalone story.And not only that, but this is no cops and robbers shoot 'em up type story. There is actually a lot of beauty conveyed in its approach and it is also evident in its visuals that slow the movie down to let the viewer feel immersed in its opium drenched atmosphere. There are moments of reflection and moments of repulsion that occurs during the moments where we don't even expect it. Even the sweetest, almost innocent moments we expect to blossom becomes overshadowed by the characters' criminal nature.And that is the story of 'Once Upon a Time in America' of how darkness can shroud the light at the end of the tunnel if we become corrupted by evil. If you loved The Godfather, then you will enjoy this movie. A tragic epic masterpiece that everyone must watch.",10,3,8,21 May 2013
A Clockwork Orange," Grotesque in its satire, yet hypnotic to the point you are drawn to its allure, as how one would be analyzing a beautiful painting
","A film that is just as artful as it crazy, whether it be its visuals that are flamboyantly colorful, its use of Beethoven to compliment Alex's over-the-top personality, or its clever dialogue. This is a film like no other that portrays a society that blurs the line between good and evil, filled with characters possessing many different oddities, where the sane and insane are basically one and the same. Every line of dialogue is witty and quotable, that it makes every situation in the movie even way more absurd than it already is, in a really good way.Malcolm McDowell is legendary in this and delivers a performance so electrifying that it will send shivers down your spine. He definitely brings out the most out of a character who is rebellious without any sense of constraint, and to see him suffer through what he's put through later on in the movie makes me feel a bit of sympathy for him, strangely, but just when we feel bad for him, he'll fill you up with disgust, once again to remind you how much he values his own grotesque freedom. His actions may be evil, but on the different sides of the spectrum, which are the sides of the good, 'do you're told' law abiding citizen to the anti-conformists, both their actions are situated in the utmost extremes that point out the flaws in each of their convictions.While both flawed, the story definitely serves its purpose of satirizing a society that values its convictions in establishing order through a system that forces everyone to conform to what constitutes a good citizen. How can society grow if we cannot let aspects of our individuality flourish? And although we should conform to having a good sense of morality, unlike Alex, we should still be able to exercise our right to freedom, instead of letting ourselves be oppressed by what society deems as 'ideal' living. And although the film leaves out the last chapter of the novel, I feel the choice of going with this ending makes just as strong of statement either way in pointing out society's flawed system.To sum everything up, 'A Clockwork Orange' is everything a satire should be, in that it is so shocking that it is able to get its points across directly. This is a film that shows ambition, but at the same time can make you laugh hysterically at things you'd feel strange for laughing at and whenever I watch this film, I feel a little twisted myself. While there are certain scenes that induce a feeling of disgust, there are many scenes that are just hilarious, and that is due to the outrageous dialogue. From watching every character interact with each other to listening to Alex's narration, there are so many overwhelmingly good lines filled with so much wit that this is bound to be a film you'd want to revisit again and again. To have a film mix dark humor with acts of a grotesque nature is one the weirdest dynamics in film and this is what I think that captivates many people to watch this film. On that note, that is what makes 'Clockwork' so great in that it executes what it sets out to do so well that you will find yourself trying not to look away at the screen, despite the horrific events that occur within in the film, and a film that can captivate me that much is in every way deserving of the title as a classic.",10,0,3,29 May 2013
Reservoir Dogs," A F$@*%d Up Situation
","The first thing that occurred to me after having finished watching 'Reservoir Dogs' was that it had some qualities that reminded of '12 Angry Men,' with whodunnit scenario and especially the economical approach to the movie. When you have strong performances outweigh superficial methods to entertain the audience, you know you have something special going on with this film, especially with Tarantino's unique method of storytelling.This may be a heist film, but instead it shows what happens before and after. Basically it deconstructs the whole scenario and seeing what goes on is pretty interesting to watch. The witty dialogue is the entertaining part of this movie and to me, that is more entertaining to watch than a bunch of explosions, as I feel this would not even fit in with the story here.If you are a person who is desensitized to movie violence (or in fiction, in general), you have to know that there is some graphic violence here, but it is not unnecessary violence that was plugged in for the sake of value. It perfectly depicts the brutality of the situation these characters have thrust themselves into.But to sum up my review of the flick, 'Reservoir Dogs' perfectly shows Quentin Tarantino's trademark style of directing, with pop culture references, violence, black humor, and every vice thrown in. Tarantino really showed a huge transition with the follow-up, 'Pulp Fiction,' but don't get me wrong, whereas 'Pulp Fiction' felt more heavily layered, 'Reservoir Dogs' has its own unique sense of charm with its more minimalist approach and simpler story. This is a must-see for all movie lovers or anyone who appreciates a good story.",8,0,0,16 May 2013
Pulp Fiction," Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character
","Funny, philosophical, stylish, violent, and vulgar are some the words I would use to describe Pulp Fiction, along with idiosyncratic due to its unique nonlinear style of telling its story. What I also love about Pulp Fiction is the amount of interesting characters and their witty dialogue. Although this is a crime movie, what makes this stand out from other films in the crime genre is having these characters being placed in the most absurd situations and how they deal with it. This isn't some regular shoot 'em up movie just about people killing other people, it's pretty much its own movie about crime where each situation goes wrong in the most random and strangest way.What I love about Pulp Fiction is that it does not try to make a point about anything, choosing not to take itself seriously. It really comes off as a movie about regular people who talk like regular people talking about some of the most random stuff, but with crime involved. This is especially evident with interactions between Vincent and Jules, which comes off pretty hilarious, since you can tell they're so use to the routine of their job that their having the most random conversations you would expect from two dudes and that's pretty much their way of passing the time before they blow a guy's head off.And the events that follow continue this tone of humor in the most weird or disturbing way. Although this is a crime film, with a lot of dark comedy, I feel Tarantino made a film that feels like a genre of its own and one that feels very post-modern. Although this is not my favorite movie, nor would I consider it the greatest of all time, Pulp Fiction is a film so unique that I don't think I have even seen any other movie that similar to it and because of this, I think everyone should watch Pulp Fiction.",10,0,2,26 May 2013
Psycho," Hitchcock executes suspense gracefully in 'Psycho' in a way that feels organic and raw, with every shot being memorable and iconic
","I am completely at a loss of words for what to say about 'Psycho' that has not already been said before, therefore I will just reiterate what others say and that the film is all deserving of its iconic status. Every shot is memorable and when I think of either the horror or the thriller genre, the shower scene instantly comes to mind, as well as the other scenes with suspense in the film. Everything feels so meticulously placed in that the suspense hits you the same way a song approaches a bombastic crescendo.The genre has come a long way and today's generation's expectations are more harder to please due to the market in the genre, but 'Psycho' laid out the blueprint to making a thriller that has basically become the standard and you can see it in pretty much every modern suspense film, it's ridiculous. And while this might not shake up anyone today, this definitely shook up many people and to watch it in that context really shows how far we've come in the genre today.And with that, I think it's safe to say that Hitchcock rightfully deserves the title as 'the master of suspense.' And with other classics under his belt, such as 'Vertigo,' 'North by Northwest, and 'Rear Window,' his diversity in utilizing the concept of suspense, whether its playing with his audience's perceptions or leaving them on the edge of their seats, is evident in each of them. As a growing movie lover (my first love being music), I have to say that despite its status in pop culture lore, 'Psycho' is still a crowning achievement in what it basically is: a great movie.",8,0,1,28 May 2013
Rosemary's Baby," Beautifully Unnerving
","If I had to pick a horror flick that perfectly captures that disturbing feeling of paranoia, then 'Rosemary's Baby' would be a perfect example. It's the type of paranoia of which things are not really what they seem or if you're just thinking way in over your head by creating this make-believe scenario.What I love about this film is that it perfectly captures this despondent atmosphere as the story progresses with the subtle nuances of the music, but to me, I think it mostly boils down to Mia Farrow's performance of Rosemary Woodhouse. She consistently conveys that paranoid feeling and you can feel her emotions when she is dealing with surroundings that are progressively provoking her suspicions, based on her perceptions.And that is basically where the 'horror' of the movie comes from which is the mood and it takes a lot of work just to use that as the only source of causing a feeling of dread in the viewer. It perfectly falls in line with the New Hollywood genre in that it relies on subtle nuances instead of huge melodrama, surprisingly creating something that is far more effective than your average blockbuster affair. There's only some disturbing imagery, but as Rosemary grows more weary of the other characters, you can feel that same dread as well. Other than that, there are no special effects, cheap high volume scares, or fast paced horror, just outstanding performances, especially from Ruth Gordon.Rosemary's Baby is a work of art in that it shines in creating horror that is bare and minimal, yet surprisingly still being able to retain a strong, brooding atmosphere that pulls you in and never lets you go until the end of the movie. 5/5",8,0,0,16 May 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," Anyone can become a prisoner in their own mind
","I can understand how some people can feel that 'The Shawshank Redemption' feels underwhelming or bland, compared to other highly acclaimed movies. I guess having that notion that all classic films have to be complex, with a bunch of overarching themes can influence one's perceptions of what is supposed to be a quality film. I have learned that every director has a vision with its own distinctiveness that differs from other directors. Whether its small or large in its scope, sometimes that is not the point. Some directors want to prove something to make a point, while some just want to just make a story that's basically good, without the need to be over-politically or socially conscious to the point where it becomes pretentious.And 'Shawshank' is basically that. A good simple story about one's will to hold on to hope despite how heavy the circumstances. Sure, some might not view it as realistic for a story about prison life, but applying to the concept of life in general is what fits and not if it rings true to how life in prison really is. It's a more of a 'life' film than a prison film. When one feels like they are in their own type of 'prison,' sometimes just having a friend to bring you a little freedom is all you need to feel free again, and that is a comforting message in all its beautiful simplicity.With its 'floating on a cloud' atmosphere, it really has a soothing, calm, and tranquil atmosphere, despite the setting being a prison. This tone is what separates 'Shawshank' from other films and becomes its own distinct world and with that the film comes off feeling more hopeful than dark at times, and I think that's more than I can ask for from this great movie, at the end of the day.",8,0,0,23 May 2013
Blade Runner," Along with 2001, the most unique science fiction film of all time. Coupled with film noir and dystopian elements, this is a film that stimulates the imagination.
","One of my favorite films of all time. Before I get into the details of this classic, I cannot stress how much the final cut is the definitive version of this film. If you plan on purchasing this film, that is the best version to buy, hands down. I also cannot stress how much the visuals in Blade Runner make today's high budget CGI movies look like a joke, which they are in my opinion. This is a film noir story spliced with science fiction and the result is something that is unique and still is. A lot of films try so hard to be gritty and dark, and Blade Runner, in my opinion, achieves that in the highest caliber. With it's dystopian setting and bleak story, the movie is very dreamlike.And what this movie achieves in doing is telling a very simple story, but with so much to say. Not a lot happens in the movie, but every scene is vital in progressing the story, without any unnecessary moments of filler. What I love about the film is that it has an ebb and flow to it which feels very intrinsic. When many films do so much and try so hard only to end up failing, Blade Runner easily succeeds by being very subtle.What is very captivating to me is that Ridley Scott created a world that is one of a great imagination. Through the visuals, it has the looks of a world that is very different from our own, but one that is living and breathing, a world that feels run down and claustrophobic to give a feeling of urban alienation, one that exists within our society. The immersiveness of this film is very strong and it takes a great storyteller to pull off a feat as great as that.While Blade Runner is a science fiction film, it hits the heart with its sense of humanity and to me, I think that is what it achieves in being such a sentimental film to me. Whenever I want to watch a film to escape, I will put on Blade Runner.",10,2,5,22 February 2013
Rear Window," A Window of Opportunity
","If there is a movie that is just as influential as 'Psycho' for its genre, it would probably be Alfred Hitchcock's thriller masterpiece, 'Rear Window.' With its focus being voyeurism, it takes us through the eyes through Cary Grant's eyes as we the audience are with him spying on the rest of the neighborhood around him. As he begins to feel a strong sense of suspicion from one of his neighbors, we start to feel the tension escalate throughout the movie and how this is executed by Hitchcock is just mindblowing.The movie already has enough suspense that Cary might be spotted and how this movie makes one feel a sense of paranoia is suspense at its utmost best. The sense that our characters might be in grave danger or they might just be making this all up in their hands adds a lot of psychological thrills to the story, because we the audience are trying to figure out the answers to a mystery where we don't have any proper evidence. I have honestly seen this type of story being mimicked by many movies/TV shows today and that just goes to show the amount of influence Hitchcock has on film.From the performances to how the movie takes place in one location, 'Rear Window' is a work of pure art, but what I love is its consistent atmosphere that comes from its urban environment. The sense of claustrophobia alone adds to the suspense. It gives a great sense of just how vulnerable our characters are to begin with and as they get deeper into their suspicions, they are making themselves even more vulnerable and increasing their chances of danger and the film captivated me from start to finish. 'Rear Window' represents our curiosity in how this obsession can take control of us, no matter how hard we try to look away. Watching 'Rear Window' or any other film, it shows we all have this impulse within us to look into another world that holds a perceived mystery to us, but in this case, it's purely worth it.",10,0,1,29 May 2013
Goodfellas," A sharp-edges gangster film that has a script that is one the all time best. One of the greatest films of all time
","What makes Goodfellas such an enjoyable film for me would have to be its hard hitting, witty dialogue. If I have to pick a film that is a winner script-wise, Goodfellas would definitely be one of the top contenders. With a script like this, there are many lines that are good enough to be quotable, and it's very long list to choose from. And the desired effect is not only achieved by the script, it had to be the select number of people who be up to the task at bringing out the sharp wit of the characters and we have a cast that really shines in that department.With Ray Liotta playing Henry Hill, his performance in letting you in on the character by putting you through his perspective with his narration alone is enough to pull you in and become captivated by the film. And as he pulls you into his world, we get introduced to numerous criminals he gets mixed up with such as Tommy DeVito played by Joe Pesci, who he plays with a lot of intensity that brings out a lot of the brutal elements in the film. When on screen, you can always sense something is going to go wrong, and what Pesci brings to this character is deserving of all the praise.Every character evokes that sense of intensity that really gives this film its distinctive edge, but one person I seem to be captivated the most by in the movie would have to be Robert De Niro's performance as Jimmy Conway, who is crazier, but in his own more methodical way that is a lot more subtle than Tommy. What Bob brings to the table is something special that again shows how versatile he is as an actor and gives me another reason as to why I think he is the greatest actor ever. He may not be in every scene, but he is the foundation of the movie for me.These are all great performances that help to bring out this story and to know that these are true events makes this film even more insane than it already is. While The Godfather felt more graceful and has placed a heavier emphasis on subtlety to make the violent scenes have more impact when they happen unexpectedly, Goodfellas is sharp all around its edges. Whereas The Godfather was violent, it offered insight into the human aspects of the criminals and the reasons they murdered for business. That sense of sentimentality is nonexistent in Goodfellas and offers a bare bones, raw insight into the crooked lives these criminals were leading, and with that, you get a story that is sharp like a knife that when it hits you, you'll know you'll never forget it.",10,1,1,29 May 2013
The Godfather," The Godfather perfectly encapsulates the essence of cinema
","I had a rough time watching The Godfather, because all the universal acclaim was completely clouding my judgement on the movie, because instead of being able to watch the movie with clarity, all this time I was looking at the opinions of the general public as the basis of finding clear reasons why to like this movie. I know everyone praises the performances, the film's structure, and every subtle nuance, but listening to those opinions gave me the idea I should be looking at these details so I will see why this movie is so great.But to my realization, I wasn't trying to find any qualities that I, MYSELF, would love about the movie. I was too busy trying to find the details of what other people liked. I was watching based on the details other people hyped up too much. That's why I have to say, you have to watch The Godfather and put the hype completely behind you and just watch it for what it is just how you would any other movie. If you develop a true opinion of the movie, not based on the hype, then that's what really matters, whether you love it or hate it.I ended up watching The Godfather for the umpteenth time. Now, before this point I really didn't have an opinion on the movie. I honestly felt it was bland and didn't give me that sense of urgency a lot of my favorite movies give me, but I didn't hate it, but I also didn't love it. But this time, it clicked somehow. I enjoyed it, oddly. I honestly found a certain quality that is very hard to create in films.And that certain detail is how beautiful this movie is. Behind all the murders and the brooding feel of the film, there is a lot of beauty. It's atmosphere is something that contrasts so heavily with its dark plot. And not only visually, but this is also evident in the execution of the acting performances, and the mood of the story. After watching Apocalypse Now and The Godfather II, I finally started to understood Francis Ford Coppola's style of storytelling. Despite The Godfather being a gangster film, it's very subtle and does not have any melodrama. I feel this is something people cannot get past, because with its legacy as a movie, they expect it to be something more in-your-face that will give you an emotional hit-in-the-gut feeling, but to one's realization, he or she will realize it is not those things.I mean there is a beautiful score, but it too is very subtle. The movie actually benefits from silence and just let the characters most of the time direct the emotion of the plot. When watching this, I cannot believe how the actors were able to execute this difficult-to-accomplish feat. If you were to tell me how I would expect one of the best ever movies to come off as, I would've given you a narrow-minded answer. Now I realize how much film is just as open-ended as music. We cannot just experience or enjoy an album or a film one time and expecting to gain that satisfaction thinking we know it from the inside out. If we watch a movie a second time, we can discover subtle nuances that weren't obvious in the first viewing, almost as if we're watching it from a completely different angle. And that's the beauty of i Despite how subtle The Godfather is, it really is a sophisticated film with repeated viewings. Is The Godfather my favorite movie of all time? I don't even know if I have one particular favorite, but I would place it in my top ten along with Citizen Kane. My advice would be to find certain qualities that YOU would like about The Godfather and not to base it on the opinions of people telling you what is so awesome about it, because film is more open-ended than that to build expectations. We all have things that we personally love. What is the best thing about the movie? For you or anyone else, it could be the acting, the story, the settings, or some subtle nuance that everyone is ignorant of. I personally love the mystical feel of the atmosphere and I think that is better than telling someone its the best movie ever just because it is. I like to listen to personal opinion, because of the individuality aspect to it. And The Godfather is way more rewarding if you watch it as an individual and judge it on your principles of what makes a good film and not to trust someone else's certainty that is the best movie ever. It's okay if you still don't like the movie, but what is crucial is you give complete clarity in forming an opinion that is completely your own based on what is important to you, most of all. I don't see what other film lovers see in The Godfather, I only see what I love about it.",10,1,3,16 May 2013
