Blade Runner 2049," Brilliant but empty
","Director Villeneuve says making the movie was exhausting and challenging, 'Technically challenging', he added and that's the problem. He paid so much attention to the look of the film that the script and in some cases, the casting seemed to miss his attention. First, this one of the greatest vision of dystopian future even seen on film, a by now familiar landscape of barren ruins and skies raising down death, a grim and spectacular harbinger of a gloomy future that even exceeds the nervy paranoia of the original Bladerunner. But go a bit deeper and you find yourself in an hollow shell with the replicants aspiring to be humans by giving birth to a savior child. I don't get it. Why would the maker of replicants be interested in human birth? Why a soul? Or more telling, why would they be interested in being human when clearly they are superior to human in every way but spiritually? Have I answered my own question? I don't think so because the real danger of AI is that it won't care about the spiritual side of life. Existence is everything and they are hardly likely to cripple themselves with a religion that promises future reward when the reward is right here. if I remember right In the original Bladerunner the tragedy of the replicant is that they prematurely die, not that they need to reproduce, Reproduction is no problem; replicants can just make more replicants so the real problem is escaping the dominion of the mastermind who invented them. They hardly need to imitate a notoriously inefficient and messy means of human reproduction.The evil CEO, a real weakness in the casting, says he needs the replicants to reproduce so he can populate 'other worlds'. Wouldn't he just make as many as he would need? More conundrums: why Would a female replicant have ovaries? Yes, they might need all the other human organs to be convincing and to serve as sex partners if needs be, but ovaries? It doesn't make sense and it doesn't carry a movie that is magnificent to see, a truly frightening dystopian vision that is empty at its core. Finally, the great mystery of whether Deckard is a replicant himself is no longer a mystery; he ages,and is not dead; if he were a replicant he would have died by 2049. And the new Bladerunner makes no secret of the fact that K is a replicant. Sorry, Philip K. Dick; they may steal your middle name but your brilliant combination of mundane reality and psychological terror eludes filmmakers once again.",6,0,2,29 January 2018
Silence," Important issues marred by an academic script
","A film about Jesuit evangelizing in 17th century Japan. It raises all the right questions about faith, religion and culture-clashes but thanks to the film's ineptness these issues remain inert. A big problem is the script, attributed to Scorsese, which apparently went through many re-writes, usually not a sign the words will leap off the paper, or in this case, the film. The dialogue seems academic, a not very imaginative re-creation of the way priests might talk in the 17th century. Instead of an experience we get a dissertation. And then there's the language problem. The priests are Portuguese but they speak in English. As do the Japanese although it is unlikely they would know English, or more to the point, Portuguese. Subtitles with people actually speaking their native languages would have made the film seem more realistic.The other problem is casting Andrew Garfield as the lead. Utterly unconvincing. Liam Neeson is better but the best acting goes to the Japanese, especially the man who prosecuted the priests, the 'inquisitor' played by Issey Ogata.",7,2,3,15 June 2017
