Catch Me If You Can," Fabulous Film...Dicaprio at his best
","Catch Me If You Can is the real life story of the forger/con man Frank Abagnale Jr. This movie was outstanding. Let me tell you, I expected it to be good, but not this good. The movie was entertaining from start to finish. Not one dull moment. Leonardo Dicaprio deserves the Golden Globe for this movie. This is by far the best preformance he has ever done in his career. If he dosen't get the Globe, I will no longer have any faith in the movie industry. He WAS Frank Abagnale Jr. He played the part to perfection. Go see this movie. It's worth the 6 bucks and more",Null,0,0,25 December 2002
A Walk to Remember," Great Movie!
","A Walk To Remember was amazing. I loved it so much. It defines what every good teen movie should be. It is the best teen movie I have seen in a LONG time. I was going to the movie at first because I am a huge fan of Shane West because of Once and Again, which I have been watching since it's premiere in 1999. But I never expected the movie to be THAT good. Mandy Moore's preformance was breathtaking as she played the charactor of Jaime Sullivan. I never expected her to be any good. And Shane West was amazing as always. I didn't expect anything but excellence from him.
For all the bad reviews out there, you must not have a heart. Because that is what this movie was, all heart. I feel sorry for all of you who didn't enjoy it :)",Null,0,0,17 March 2002
