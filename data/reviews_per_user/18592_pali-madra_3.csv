Changeling," Excellent film
","Just watched the film.All I want to say is it is tough to make movies like these which deal with reality and keep the viewer hooked. This one does if you are a parent or that age.This movies is a must for anyone over 40. If you are over 40 and have not watched this movie in my opinion you are missing something - go give this movie its 141 minutes of your life it deserves.Lastly I want to tip my hat to Clint Eastwood. Till now I was not a die hard fan, not that I hated him, but he gained a different respect today. Hats off!",10,2,3,21 July 2014
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Brilliant movie
","The movie is brilliant and has me hooked to Guy Ritchie whom I knew nothing about apart from the fact that he was married to Madonna once. Guy is a entertainer in his own right in my eyes know (Madonna or no Madonna).I could not understand some of the dialogues not only the first time but till the fourth time. Though I did understand 85% of the dialogues but only could comprehend the 15% left after turning on the subtitles. This does not mean the dialogues are not good. They are excellent. The accent - great! I'm going to try and get it in fact. Some of the dialogues are delivered so fast that they cannot be comprehended. The dialogues contain gems and exposed me to English slang like no other piece of art. Sample this 'Eddie: They're armed. Soap: What was that? Armed? What do you mean armed? Armed with whatEddie: Err, bad breath,colorful language, feather duster... what do youthink they're gonna be armed with? Guns, you tit! 'The camera work is brilliant. Some of the techniques were fairly new at that time which have been hailed as path breakers for example the camera work when one of the protagonist looses a card game. The actors, some of whom I have never heard of till date, fit their roles like hand in glove.The music is just about perfect yet diverse. A soundtrack worth buying.Some viewers would categorize it as comedy or black comedy but I would beg to disagree. The film has a genre of it's own which has comedy, action, emotion and stylish.I would recommend the movie a rating of 9/10.",9,2,3,31 August 2014
The Green Mile," One of the classics
","One of the best films that that the world has seen and will see.The movie is long but the storytelling is such that it keeps you riveted and wanting to know what happens next. That is what good movies are about.The movie is perfect adaptation of a Stephen King novel. It could not have been done better. There are some graphic scenes but they are part of the storyline and honestly I have seen worse scenes in other movies. From actors like Tom Hanks we have come to expect good performances. The surprise package is Michael Clarke Duncan is at his finest. Any doubt on his acting abilities, due to his persona and body, are swept away as he keeps surprising you scene after scene. David Morse does an excellent job as well.It is on top of my 'must see' list.",10,1,3,31 July 2014
