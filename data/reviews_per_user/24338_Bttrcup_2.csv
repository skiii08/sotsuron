The Blair Witch Project," Suspense builds slowly and steadily to terrifying conclusion
","This movie ranks not only as the scariest movie I've ever seen, but as one of the scariest experiences I've ever had. I knew going in that this was not real, but it is so well executed that you easily get sucked in. I kept waiting for one scene or one line to ring false, then the whole thing would have fallen apart, but it never rings false. The terror these characters feel is so vividly expressed on camera that you empathize totally and are drawn in to their nightmare. One hell of a scary flick. Don't miss it.",10,1,2,21 July 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Same Old Same Old
","I suppose if you are a huge fan of Tim Burton's style (and let's face it, that's all he is... style) then this movie might satisfy. If, however, you are interested in multi-dimensional characters that you care about, and a story that's feels even remotely genuine, then skip Sleepy Hollow.
Once again, Tim Burton has focused all his attention on atmosphere. I will give Tim Burton this much credit, he has the dreamy, gothic, spooky yet droll at the same time, moody atmosphere down pat. The world that he creates on screen is marvelously complete. The only problem is that it's the same world that he creates in all his films and I'm REALLY bored with it.It never ceases to amaze me that Hollywood can pour such obscene amounts of money into effects and star power, and yet when it comes to a decent script with sharp, believable dialogue they turn into Ebenezer Scrooge. The dialogue in this movie is so trite and cliche that I actually found myself laughing out loud in the theater. It is a crime to force such talented actors to speak such ridiculous words.This film has finally made me accept the truth, I just don't like Tim Burton films. SKIP IT.",Null,0,0,13 December 1999
