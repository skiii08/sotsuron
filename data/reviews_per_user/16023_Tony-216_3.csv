Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Simply Amazing!
","To all the people (wanna be critics) trashing this movie, I have one thing to say. GET A LIFE! This movie was so much fun, that I'm still amazed by it. It's exciting, it's funny, and it ties in with the rest of the trilogy as well as sets us up for the new episodes.You really have to be quite stupid if all you do is take this movie apart to find faults in it. Having grown up after the original trilogy, this one seems far superior to me then the old ones, as I have no special attachments to the originals as a lot of you here seem to, and will not defend their obvious weaknesses. The special effects were breathtaking, and if you think otherwise you don't know what you are talking about. Some said it's not state of the art, well let me tell you something, I'm studying computer graphics and see things most people wouldn't notice, and I was simply blown away. Even the creatures who usually look fake, or move in unrealistic ways looked good here. In one battle there are thousands of cgi characters fighting thousands more, and as most of you critics have no clue how hard that is to do, it's pathetic for you to say that it's not special. Tell me what a radiosity raytracer is, then we'll talk.Next, a lot of people are trashing the acting, well why don't you just take a look at a new hope, and see what 'plastic' acting is all about. In phantom, all the actors do a good job in playing their characters. The queen is supposed to be solemn and determined, and so are the jedi, always calm.So, all in all, if you haven't seen this movie, run and see it.Don't pay attention to what the so called critics say. Sit back and enjoy the show. Don't expect the world either, this is a movie after all. Yes jar jar, gets annoying but later on its not so bad, yes darth maul should get more screen time, but those are minor things. This is quite an experience.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
Enemy at the Gates," Might seem ok, if you're not familiar with real history.
","The only plausible reason for this movie's existence is the director's ego.Why do I say this? I find it remarkable that he would find the actual events surrounding the battle of Stalingrad so un-compelling that he would choose to invent his own reality. The movie is called enemy at the gates suggesting the enormous epic battle of Stalingrad, but this is not to be. It would have been better to name it the duel, as that is the real focus of the movie. By showing the battle in the very beginning, the movie is trying to have it both ways, but it can't. By the middle you might forget that there are millions of people involved on both sides, tanks on the ground, planes in the air, boats in the river. Instead you might think the red army did not have a single tank or plane after watching this movie.Going into the battle Annaud aims for a sense of dread, but misunderstands the motivations of the characters. Among the main things is that Russian soldiers actually WANTED to go to the front lines. Something Annaud apparently can't fathom. Kids would run away from home and lie about their age. Teens that finished school went off for military training. Men left their families to do their duty. Few doubted that the war would be won, it was simply a matter of when. When the troops arrive at the shore of the broken city, Annaud again misfires. The soldiers did not have a shortage of weapons. This was already the middle of the war, factories were working day and night, with even tractor factories making tanks. Nor were the men turning back. It was not an option, there was nowhere to fall back. They knew that if they didn't hold on the war could be lost. When you are fighting for the survival of your home you don't need any more motivation then that. Let's not forget that the soldiers are fighting for their own soil. What Annaud was probably thinking of was a 'ShtrafBat' a battalion made of soldiers accused or cowardice or other often false accusations. These were literally used to clear minefields by marching through them! These did have NKVD machine gunners shooting anyone that turned back. This is something more gruesome then anything Annaud imagined, but this was usually not the case for regular troops.  Moving on, there's absolutely nothing wrong with focusing on the sniper battle, it's extremely compelling. However Annaud would almost have you believe it had a key importance to the battle itself, which it couldn't have. It's merely a vignette, though a really fascinating one. Nor was Zaitsev alone. The newspapers would take ANY event they considered significant and spread the news all over the country. The idea that Zaitsev was used as some sort of motivation for not losing the war is therefore ludicrous.What it boils down to is that the movie might have been good had Annaud not delved into the bigger picture and became mired in things he didn't understand. The sniper battle itself is at times captivating. Had the movie narrowed the focus to the two opposing snipers themselves it might have been great. Adding on the love story and trying to comment on everything from politics to tactics bogged it down. Annaud would have done better to simply bring a handful of old Russian war movies to western screens, for they have covered this all before, and covered it better.",Null,1,2,8 January 2004
Enemy at the Gates," Unfortunately Forgettable
","For a movie about one of the most epic battles in history this one comes across a bit shallow. In fact you'd never guess this was an epic battle just from watching this movie. You could say this is just a small episode of this battle, but not when you have dialogue like 'you can win the war for us' thrown in there. It makes the duel sound far more important then it was and makes it seem as if the whole battle was decided by the duel (like in the middle ages). Also the director probably thought he was being clever by throwing in some elements of politics, but that just detracts from the movie by leaving threads which lead nowhere. For example the sniper that says all his teeth were knocked out by his own people (the NKVD). This is an interesting topic in and of itself but adds nothing to the movie since it barely scratches the surface (and it's wrong at that, he would have been sent to a forced labor camp, and how he made it out to fight is a mystery). Then there is this obvious fear of showing the red army as the good guys. Why that should even be an issue is beyond me. And yet we are forced to listen to people having doubts about the system. Not only was this uncommon among those who weren't aware of the purges, but you wouldn't dare say such things out loud. And it does a great deal of disservice to the people who gave their lives for their motherland without thinking twice about it. This isn't even apparent during the charging attack scenes. Those soldiers didn't need much motivation, it is in fact their insane bravery which gave them the edge in the first place. This is something that the movie fails to show. The director also tries hard to make the opening scenes more dramatic by making the soldiers very poorly armed. But while very true in the beginning of the war, it wasn't quite the same by the Battle of Stalingrad. Also we are talking about more then a million people involved in very bitter fighting for every street, every house, every room! This could have made for very dramatic scenes but it's totally missing. And then there is that tacked on, borrowed from Hollywood love triangle. It doesn't exactly add anything to the plot either. I mean at least stick to the facts, make Zaitsev give her sniping lessons for instance. This way we learn more about snipers, and see a bond develop between them, but this? Also there are little annoying details which might not be too important but are very distracting. The accents that everyone keeps mentioning are a real issue. When those actors speak in those British accents you instantly identify them as just that, British! It's not just English, it's a very specific dialect from a very specific place. Really, subtitles would have worked better, and even Russian actors for that matter, as unlike Jude Law, Joseph Feinnes doesn't look even remotely Russian! There are so many more things to go into but I can best sum it up this way : the Russian movie on Zaitsev (part of a big 'liberation' series), is superior, though it was done on a mere fraction of the budget and no stars to speak of.",Null,1,2,14 April 2001
