Requiem for a Dream," Trivial. Pretentious. Beautiful.
","This movie has a very banal script; we have the usual story of addiction and self destruction, a mix between 'The Boost' and 'Trainspotting'.Apart from this, almost all is perfect. Powerful acting, innovative photography, appropriate soundtrack, interesting editing and direction - a little too pervasive and self-celebrating, to be honest.You could see this movie and don't like it because there's nothing new under the sun (and you should be right). Or, you could see this movie and just love how all things have been put together. I'm with this second party.8/10",8,0,0,16 September 2002
The Others," A new horror/thriller classic
","This movie is what I call a real thriller: it grabs your nerves from the very beginning, and doesn't releases them at the end with a silly, happy finish. The script isn't very original; what really makes the difference is the atmosphere created by the direction, photography, editing and acting. Sometimes you can forget you are watching a movie, and really feel in the darkness. If you (like me) think that most of last years' thrillers are weak, you should check this.8/10",8,0,0,12 September 2002
Men in Black II," Just funny
","Well balanced, never boring, with a lot of gems (like the exhilarating creatures in the locker). If you are going to see this movie in believing it's a masterpiece, of course you will be disappointed; instead, if you are going to see it by knowing what it is (just a funny, self-joking movie) you will enjoy.7/10",7,0,0,16 September 2002
