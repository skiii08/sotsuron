It," Average reboot
","It just full of unrelated scenes bundled together into a movie.
Motivation unclear, boring angles and hyped up marketing made into a mess.",5,2,4,22 October 2018
Hereditary," Stunning build up, disappointing climax
","Everything from the casts acting to the grim color palette, filming angles that were shown in the movie were absolutely top notch, if not one of the best of year.And just like every other reviews before me, the ending was a rather odd. Why did he do that? What will happens afterward? Why and how are the questions that will linger in your mind for couple days and still send chills down your spines whenever you think about it.",8,4,8,22 October 2018
The Shining," Revolutionary classic, but poor plot
","Back in the day, it might have been the classic
I see that there are some merits that make this somewhat a revolutionary horror movie
the camera movements were absolutely outstanding for its time, with Steadycam of course
The sounds, the chords that are played at key moments, horrific
The striking visual at first glance as well, very impressive
The unsettling setting, the tight hallways with off-key light color from far away
Also the fellatio scene was a rather odd comical relief
Full of unexplained holes, as always
Havent read the book, but it seems like the wife was a little braver, according to Stephen King himself",6,1,5,22 October 2018
A Quiet Place," Mediocre despite the huge marketing
","Tension was there for sure, but it fell flat 'into a nail'.Another generic horror click for your spooky October when there is nothing else to see on TV.",5,1,1,22 October 2018
