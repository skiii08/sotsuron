10 Cloverfield Lane," Stuck Inside A Bunker With The Cloverfield Blues Again
","First off, if you are not a fan of John Goodman, this movie is not for you. He puts on a bravura performance as an unhinged survivalist that may or may not be telling the truth about the conditions outside the bunker (after some undefined apocalypse) to the two survivors he's basically trapped. Two-thirds of this movie is a character study with very little action but well done if you like that sort of thing, which I do. The ending of the movie has disappointed people, but I thought it was great. Plus, Mary Elizabeth Winstead does her usual fine acting work, so this is a must for her fans.",7,0,0,4 May 2020
Unknown," Add A Point If You Love Fights and Car Chases
","Pretty fun action thriller, though I had a vague awareness of the resolution to the mystery early on - just not the details. Liam does Liam and Diane Kruger steals the movie with her badass charm in what is basically a sidekick role. The action scenes could have been trimmed a bit, as the story dragged in the middle, but it picks up again for a cliched (and corny - somewhat literally) but slam-bang finish.",6,0,0,29 April 2020
