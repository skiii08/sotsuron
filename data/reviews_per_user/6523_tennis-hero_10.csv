Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," this could have been the greatest movie ever made
","but it wasn't George Lucas made 3 of the best films ever made, he created a believable universe that everyone could almost imagine being a part of, or at least wanting to be.He helped created the coolest weapon ever known to man, the light-saber.So i ask you reader, was it possible for George to ruin his reputation, his legacy and his franchise in one single movie? answer- no, it took 3 really bad films- (or pre-quels- he's so smart isn't he) to ruin his reputation, episode one just happens to be the worst of the 3 and also the worst film ever made.",1,5,11,20 August 2009
The Adventures of Tintin," Best Spielberg movie since Raiders
","I always thought Raiders was the star wars moment of my childhood-the film that made me become obsessed with cinema and love the magic of it all... and i always thought star wars was overrated (but thats another matter)for the longest time spielberg could do no wrong, but then, in recent years his films had lost something i don't know what the speielberg magic is- but his efforts from recent years haven't had 'it'- almost as though he was winding down Tintin is a step back to the old spielberg who made magic- its his best work in years- an absolute classiclike all the best children's movies, and especially true of most pixar films- the children love it but the adults love it just as much for different reasonscharacterisation is mainly spot ontintin is excellent snowy is awesome haddock is a racist stereotype (hollywood using a tired old steroeotype??? (sarcasm) say it ain't so (/sarcasm) but he's still wonderfully playedaction sequences are amazing-only bad point is it feels just a tad bit too long- but its as good as it gets- and most importantly it captures the spielberg magic we haven't seen in years",8,1,2,9 May 2012
Interstellar," this is the worst film of 2014
","Christopher Nolan had sold outeither that or he has zero talent and someone else made mementothats how bad this film is- there are times when the schmaltz borders on Michael bay territory- thankfully it never goes full baythe TLDR version of why this film sucks cooper played by that douche bag is awful- i don't know if its bad directing or his obnoxious voice but its irritating i swear he cant act- hes supposed to be an engineer but you feel like hes a lost drug dealer speaking of annoying- Hathaway- Why is she here, her top lip is hairier than ron Jeremy's back he acting is awful- why is cat-woman in this film- acting exactly like cat-woman- why cant she give more than one facial expression why does she look like a cat peed on her half the time- that surly expression like shes the most entitled female you'll ever meet- oh and the eating disorder body shape= God eat something woman, you look like a teenage boyNOLAN- why cant you write a female who has more than 1 dimension- aren't we going to evolve into 5 dimensional beings? well certainly your writing never willAND THE SCHMALTZ! that kills this film- you go in expecting an artistic epic- you get Spielberg after a divorce settlement- its bad its REALLY BADthe ending is so bad i wish Michael bay directed it so i wouldn't hate Nolan so muchthis is the kind of film Seth mcfarlen will enjoyNolan you son of a female dog- i spent money on this you btard i feel robbed by this film even Michael bay gives better value for...... no, no he doesn'ton the plus side- the robot TARS- has more personality than the rest of the film combined",3,4,8,2 December 2014
The Matrix Revolutions," This is the worst sequel ever made
","To understand how bad this film is, one must understand how great the first film wasthe mythology, the ideas, the writing, the brilliancethe first matrix film is one of the all time great films ever made- and had i not had this sequel made it may still be considered thatits rare for a sequel to be so bad that it actually makes the proceeding film worse- that, my friend, is an achievementi'm a firm believer that the wachowski brothers had no input in the first film- they stole all the ideas- because they were involved in this abomination and it simply has nothing to do with the first film, bar sharing the same charactersthe wachowski brothers are the cinematic equivilents then, of stalin, of mao, of Hitler at his worst- they have polluted a once great idea, a great film experience into some semi-neo con indulgent circle jerk its awful what they created in this messif you are looking for positives for this messi can say, if you never watched the first film then you can watch this with your brain switched offimagine this as a michael bay film and you have an idea of what to expect....on second thoughts i apologise for that hideous comment- the wachowski brothers are cinematic hitlers but its just wrong on all levels to even compare them to michael baynothing is as bad as michael baythe only word that fits this film is huge let downits like the first film is a perfect rose in a garden, you can marvel at its beauty, or its complexity, you can think about it later and appreciate it on a whole new levelthis sequel is like the smell of dung hanging around the garden",1,3,6,12 October 2014
Pearl Harbor," This film is legendary
","Before pearl harbor Michael bay was known as a hacksomeone with very limited skills, almost zero directing ability and no charisma at all there were even rumors that michael bay might not even exist, just an AI of every clich√© Hollywood every producedthen pearl harbor came alongthis is not a filmthis is a hate crime this is an abomination this is stalin's gulagsmichael bay is pol pot on steroidsthe acting is perhaps the worst even committed to film the cinematography is lousy the story is non existentthe film pearl harbor is a greater act of terror than the event",1,3,4,17 November 2014
City of God," Lives up to the hype and so much more
","This is the story of one guy, who lived in some poor slum.but it also the story of the slum itself... how the slums destroy people and turn them into animals.the main character is not the main character- he is just a passive observer as we are.the other characters are equally just observers.the main character is poverty and the slums it creates, the lives it creates and destroys. the main character is greed and how it corrupts and destroys friendship and love. the main character is how the soul copes with constant pain, and how fragile life and death truly is.the main character is our very nature...City of God- captures a moment and a place, but it could be any moment and any other place, it captures the circle of life and death... mans worst emotions and desires, his very nature being brought forward... and in all that darkness we see one light trying to make sense of it all *SPOILER* i added a spoiler because i want to talk about the ending.The end may seem like a 'good' ending- our 'main' character goes on to become one of Brazil's best newspaper reporters. however, that isn't the end of the film at all...thw real end is watching the main antagonist die and watching children take his place.... no, not children killing him, but the slums themselves killing him, devouring first his soul and then his body... and watching the circle repeat with a new generation. the end is simply the truth- the poor will always suffer, the rich will always prosper, and the only way to become like the rich is to be more ready to tred over others on your way to the top.This film isn't about a slum in Brazil, its about human nature",10,1,3,20 August 2009
Django Unchained," best film since pulp fiction
","Tarantino is the greatest filmmaker who has ever lived.although Django doesn't top reservoir dogs or pulp fiction- its by far better than anything else made by anyone else.Tarantino should be commended for having the balls to make a real film about the slavery holocaust. the way human beings were treated like cattle.the dialogue is mesmerizing, the cinematography incredible- the nods to westerns (typically Tarantino) genius the gun play tops john woo (previously inconceivable) i hope Tarantino continues to make magnificent films",10,1,5,9 January 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Joss Whedon is the worst sell out in cinema history
","This film is OK if you are a michael bay fanif you can turn your brain off, and not think (in other words if you are a conservative in America) this movie is great fluffeveryone else will ghate this messwhy?whats the point of a villain if hulk can one shot himwhy call it avengers, why not hulk does stuffhulk can do almost anythingexcept try to look interested in scarlet Johansenand you know, there must be a superhero at work, because it takes super powers for anyone to give her an acting jobher voice is nasally she looks old and fat she cant act why does she get any screen time, i don't knowThor is supposed to be a god. he gets jobbed out as some fret boy douche bag in every avengers filmPG 13 waters this turd down to almost urine levels of awfulhulk goes crazy and rampages in the cityNOT A SINGLE PERSON GETS HURTwhy bother at this point with the hulk dynamic, he wont ever hurt anyone, the biggest problem with hulk is PG13- ruins any tension because you know he wont hurt anyoneRDJ phones it in, he looks bored by this point, his ego is too big to share screen time with B listersevans as cap is good, but they give him so little to work with- hes literally got no story arc, hes john cena, hes mr nice guy, he has no personality, no depth, hes a kitten with a frisbyultron is awful as a villaini think whedon is a hack, he cant do this kind of thing justicedon't waste your time with this film, wait until they show it free on live TVyou're not missing anything that wasn't in the first avengers",1,37,98,26 April 2015
The Dark Knight," A good film that is so stuck up on American patriotism that it almost ruins the film itself
","Before I start let me say that this is still an excellent film- surely over hyped but it is a solid if slightly overrated film IF you want to read about all the good things about this film read someone else's review of it I just want to nitpick some craters first of all the film is too long- by the end you will be happy to see the credits. the ending is good but it has dragged on so long that you start to not care.secondly the NOT SUBTLE AND VERY STUPID FLAG WAVING THAT RUINS THIS FILM. the unbelievably not subtle flag waving kills this film. everywhere you see slight hints at Iraq, flag waving, taking a hit for the side, buildings blowing up, good solider....err police officers and civilians dying because of a war on terr--- err a war on the joker LMAO- boring... if you are a flag waving American I'm sure you'll love it -if you noticed it being paraded in your face every ten seconds- i'm sure everyone else had more then their fill of America love.Bale just doesn't do batman right.... he does Bruce Wayne right, but that silly deep 'i smoke 60 cigarettes a day to speak like this' accent makes batman seem like a pantomime villain The Joker is perfect, amazing show stealing good and its a damn shame he wont return In the end this is a good film that had good marketing and happened at a time when America loves to toot its own horn, and reassure itself that it always makes good decisions",7,5,12,20 August 2009
Pulp Fiction," best film ever made
","Newton said he got to where he was by standing on the shoulders of giantsnot a nice way to live your life, as shoulders aren't the best places to have your legs, and risk of injury from high places is increased- but it worked for himin Tarantino the giants are kurosawa, De Palma, spielberg, and a million others- but especially scorsaces and john wooPulp fiction seems like the film martin would make if he enough talent- and thats saying something but because he was probably the best director until Tarantino came aroundironically (of course) without all the previous directors pulp fiction would never have been madeTarantino is a perfect sponge of creative artistry and he has learned the best techniques from everyone else, and (CRUCIALLY) learned from their mistakesno one else touches him- and i doubt anyone else ever will- he manages to get so much mileage out of every character- his dialogue is masterful and brings out every last drop of ability from each actor his direction is incredible, he throws in every difficult pan and swing and movement of the camera and its so effortless- he is a master at work- its almost embarrassing- he is showing off - and making everyone else look amateur the story is captivating- its a story of characters- a lot of charactershow many other films have you seen where this many characters have all been as well developed- neverexample!walken's story about butch's father- maybe 3 minutes long- more character than every star wars film togetherthis is the best cinema will ever get- Criticisms?Tarantino makes every other film maker look bad- the only criticism i can think of is that he'd never live upto this film again (he didn't- but then no one else could have made pulp fiction in the first place)you don't' need to see this film- if you enjoy films and you haven't then you don't enjoy films you need to own this film- because repeat viewings only add depthtoo long didn't read?BEST.FILM.EVER",10,0,2,9 May 2012
