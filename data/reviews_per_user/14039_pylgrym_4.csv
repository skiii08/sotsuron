The New World," 'The Old Is Better...'
","'No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, the old is better...' (Luke 5:39) . . . I brought the perspective of a born-again, saved, washed-in-the-blood, King James Bible-toting calvinistic baptist Vietnam and Desert Storm vet who voted for Kerry to this film, and was just blown away. At heart I feel the film is evangelistic at its core; the subtext is the passing of the old world of pagan America and the coming of the Christian. The stark contrasts between the old and the new worlds of this movie made me so thankful to have been born in a Christian land! I was so filled with emotion when the little princess prayed, and felt great swellings of feeling when she met the King and Queen of England (must get the soundtrack!)....to top it off, the 'art' cinema here in Atlanta was playing 'Naked in Ashes'. So I ended up coming out of an old fashioned double feature quite literally weak in the knees. The demographics on the stage of history speak for themselves, but when put into artistic form as this, every thinking person must agree that, for all the problems in the world, and for all the problems inherent in human organizations such as 'churchianity' - Christ is truly the answer.",10,2,6,21 January 2006
Across the Universe," Say, were YOU There?
","Say, were you there? were you born in the fifties? did you go to Vietnam, see Yellow Submarine on the Big Screen? Do you remember your first hit of acid/ your first maryjane rush to the tunes on Revolver or even performing with your theater cast party the entire SGT Peppers album? Why even try to comment on something you know nothing about? Did you listen to the White Album in the fall of 1968 on a dorm turntable set to 'endless replay'? memorize the Lyrics to 'Glass Onion'? well, I suppose everyone is entitled to an opinion. i was afraid to see this with anyone else, for fear my reactions would embarrass them.. yes, i was in NYC in the summer of 1970, still mourning the breakup, visiting a friend and fellow fan who would be dead of AIDS less than 20 years later; too, I was in Boulder, CO that fateful summer, and Berkely, CA - saying goodbye and farewell as I prepared my heart for the united States Army. See, we all went to 'Let It be' and we all went out on the barricades on campus and we mourned the deaths at Kent and Jackson State, as we had the deaths of MLK and RFK the year we graduated... It is so easy for me to fall into this movie. I had never seen ms Wood in a film, and she so reminds me of old girlfriends! I dropped out of college, wasted an academic, Big ten scholarship and in an existential rage went to Vietnam as an infantryman. Good dope and live ammo. 1971 was a nightmare. I survived horrors beyond imagining only by the grace of god Almighty - whom i could have cared less about in 1968..... so see this as homage, as eulogy, as tribute to an era long gone and blessedly dead, but bear with us dinosaurs and sixties survivors who need the catharsis still, the weeping that endures for a couple of harmless hours... could I take my wife, kids, grandkids to see this? the movie PLATOON? not either of them - not hardly. but for those of you born after 1958, my heart's desire is that you honor the memories of your older siblings, parents, relatives and friends, and cut us the slack we so dearly need.",8,1,3,28 October 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," Where Was George Pal When We Needed Him?
","Watch 'Destination Moon', 'When Worlds Collide', 'War of the Worlds', 'Conquest of Space', 'The Time Machine' and you'll gain deep insight into the deranged genius of Stanley Kubrick. George Pal influenced '2001' in many, many ways. His space and disaster movies moved the Fifties like Stanley's moved the late Sixties. The dramatic paradigm and world-view shifts between the Pals and the Kubricks are a wonder to behold in hindsight....But I trow the PAL movies will be watched by more people for their deeper and more resonant, Christian themes long after the evolutionist, misanthropic, irony-drenched black comedies of Kubrick are shelved.... INCLUDING '2001' Yes, in light of the superior Pal space films, you may watch '2001' as a dark, ironic comedy, produced by a man so self-obsessed as to border on the megalomaniacal! Read the stories of folks who actually had to work with Stanley. Now compare the fan base of George Pal. Compare the outputs! Some of Stanley's movies are unwatchable today; the charming Puppetoons will never lose their luster.... but I digress. It will be enough just for you to watch 'Conquest of Space' to see what I am talking about. Kubrick simply copied Pal with his own deviant, derivative drivel! He out-banals banal!",5,4,8,2 February 2006
Eyes Wide Shut," 'A Film for Two, Who Are Now of Film Age....'
","I paraphrase DIM the new policeman from the film Pauline Kael found >Cold and repellent<: >A CLOCKWORK ORANGE<.... her review is here....http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0051.html .... if you cut and paste or just Google it; but the best I have read deals with this Stanley's swan song-marvel in some detail, here:....http://www.lipmagazine.org/articles/revicontent_102.htm . . . (I just LOVE reviewer Tim Kreider's sad comic strip - thepaincomics dot com.) In light of the ironies subsequent to the film's release (Kubrick drops dead - foul play of business for the superrich as usual?) and the disintegration of 'The Two' (My summary title), and Nicole's subsequent work for Pollack in 'The Interpreter', I can't help imagining and dreaming that this is all the work after all of the Almighty God, maker of Heaven and Earth, and Himself the True Ultimate Ironist! Stanley Kubrick, no custodian of culture by any means, surely a clean-minded pornographer (Kael again), was an ironist; he now knows for sure and forever what the score is. I sure am glad he lived long enough to make EWS! Lord help us poor, servile clockwork folks keep our eyes open!",8,1,2,23 February 2006
