Blade Runner 2049," Where's the beef?
","So many great visuals, ambiance, etc. The plot is horrid and empty.Super smart scientists have a problem. They can create androids with human like intelligence, but can't figure out how procreation works. Somehow, this knowledge was lost, but if only they had an example of a procreated android, then they could reverse engineer it or something.That's problem number 1. Problem number 2, is that the company does know how to replicate the androids. It's called using factories. They can even have the androids build the factories if they want to exponentiate.Then there is problem number 3. In what world would you want to take superhuman androids, and have them self-replicate? I suppose in a world where you don't want the human race to survive.How can anyone get interested in such an implausible plot line? Not myself. 3 hours of looking at beautiful art-work is nice, but it gets boring.The little dribbles of introspection, like I don't have a soul because I don't have a mother, are laughable.Wait till it comes out on DVD, so you can use the fast forward button.",6,6,13,19 October 2017
