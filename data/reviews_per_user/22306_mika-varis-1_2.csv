The Avengers," Not so good after all ---- in fact a mess
","Very short counter review from a long-time movie-freak (not so much a superhero-freak, although I read a lot of comic books).The Avengers is completely overestimated in my mind. Why? It mostly reminded me Transformers 2 and Transformers 3 --- which were both god-awful movies. Very similar pointless action and destruction without any weight. If compared to Nolan's Batman -films, this is very cheap storytelling without gravity.Also: I almost slept watching The Avengers. There is no threat what so ever. The villains are plastic robots. Very boring. No tangible psychology behind it.There's no story. The flying ship is hugely boring. Most of the so called heroes are sissies in thighs (Thor, Loki, Arrow-Dude, Captain Boring etc) with exception of The Iron-Fellow who wears steel.Anything good? Not really. I give one star from male-perspective -- Scarpetta Johansson (as it's nice to call her) is surprisingly watchable when trapped in her chair. Cheap trick, but works. Also other male star --- Hulk is interesting those few seconds he got reasonable sequences.All in all. Two stars. There's only few seconds of interesting stuff to watch during this overlong 2,5h film. I try but fail to understand all the hype. Hopefully you can accept my reasoning.",2,21,50,9 May 2012
The Adjustment Bureau," Zero to one star rubbish movie
","Truly one of the worst and most ridiculous film ever made. Just really really bad. Stupid hats, stupid 'plan maps' stupid doors. Stupid running around.E. Blunt's charisma is negative. Matt Damon seems to be interesting for awhile but one just has to ponder how stupid he must have felt - his lines in the second half of the film are just so so so bad. Every plotpoint feels to be in a wrong place. Turn the handles in the right direction. Remember to keep your hat on! The rain and other surprises are done to make it little more difficult for you and everybody. But if you run fast enough through some stupid doors, they will be disoriented. We will reset your brain so beware! Thompson is the hammer who works out every situation. Chairman is in every one of us. Oh, c'mon! Please.Absolutely horrible movie. What a disgrace. So unneeded movie. What a waste of money. Nobody should waste time with this one.",1,2,3,15 November 2012
