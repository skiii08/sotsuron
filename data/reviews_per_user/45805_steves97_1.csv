The Blair Witch Project," Loved it, but you might hate it
","Like most movies, whether or not someone likes TBWP will usually depend on what they're looking for.  Many people enjoy horror movies because of the special effects, gore, shocks, and, in some cases, the high production value.  Since TBWP came from a small independent film company that cost less than a hundred grand to make, can a moviegoer really expect all that and have a good time?  I honestly don't think so.Myrick and Sanchez had a terrific idea for a film: make a frightening mock documentary that was supposed to look like it was done by some amateur college students.  Some people seem to be under the impression that the movie was about the witch, when what it really was about the mental and emotional breakdown of the three film students.  I feel that once viewers could accept the low production values and the improvised script, only then could they deal with Heather, Josh, and Mike.  Until they do that, the film would never work for them.I just put myself in their position:  I'm lost in the woods, I'm tired, I'm hungry, and I've got the added stress of returning borrowed equipment.  The weather is getting colder, it rains just enough to make life miserable, and something is waking me up each and every night.  Now, I'm exhausted, grouchy, scared, and I having troubles thinking clearly.People might have hated Heather because they she was bitchy and annoying, but all three of them had their moments, good and bad. Many people might have also hated the fact that not everything was explained to them, and that they never got to see the Blair Witch.  Many other people may have resented Artisan Entertainment's marketing campaign, although they can't deny just how effective it was.  All the filmmakers and actors asked was that filmgoers understand the spirit that was intended; without it, they knew the film couldn't work for anybody.As you might already tell, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  What Haxan Films managed to do with what they had is not only revolutionary, but is also inspirational to independent filmmakers everywhere.  I found the backstory interesting, the plotline well thought out, and the characters extremely developed, considering the lack of structure and guidelines within the film. If you do decide to see this film, I think you'll enjoy it if you see it for what it simply is, nothing more; it might even scare the hell out of you!",8,133,198,21 June 2000
