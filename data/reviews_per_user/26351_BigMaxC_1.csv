Resident Evil: Afterlife," So Bad!
","This film is like a poor man's MATRIX at times. Some of the scenes were such a rip-off I had to stop myself laughing out loud, it was EMBARRASSING! Unfortunately, the film is NOT a comedy, it's not a horror either. In fact, neither is it a thriller. It's basically pi$$ poor.The storyline was poor, when not incomprehensible & I'm not quite sure why I stayed until the end.However, thankfully, I have now forgotten how it ended anyway.... So now, on with the rest of my life, to try & forget the rest of this film.Wish me Luck!",Null,3,8,30 September 2010
