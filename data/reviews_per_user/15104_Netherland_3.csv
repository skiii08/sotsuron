Mission: Impossible III," Ethan Hunt Strikes Back
","From the prologue of Mission: Impossible III you can tell, this movie will be different from the others. It will be darker, and packed with thrills.The story is great, the thrills are great, the actors are... you know where I'm heading. Except for the ending, which was a bit too sweet for my opinion (they could've better used a M:I ending: after the last thrill, cut to Hunt back at home, and use the same shot as in the beginning: picking up the phone, hearing a code which makes it clear for the viewers that he'll get another mission), I've got nothing bad to say about this film. On every point that M:I II failed to be a M:I sequel, this movie passed with flying colours. Nothing too romantic, no over-use of the masks, no corny fights or dialogue, more (impressive) impossible missions, a villain that actually makes an impression on you, and a couple of nice plot-twists.In short, M:I III was better than I could hope for, and if III will be the standard, I can only hope that M:I IV will follow soon.",9,3,6,3 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Episode 1
","After The Phantom Menace I hoped that Anakin would not be a pain in the ass this time. I was wrong to think that.In Return of the Jedi, George Lucas used Ewoks to get children to watch the movies. In Episode 1 he tried this again, this time using Jar Jar Binks and that annoying brat who played Anakin. In Attack of the Clones, Lucas used romance to lure women to the epos... I don't know if that worked, but at least the romance is the only disappointment in this Episode (oh yeah, and Christensen of course). Don't get me wrong, from time to time, romance in a movie is good, but not in a Star Wars movie. At least not this much.Episode 1 was a good movie, but not Star Wars-good. Episode 2 was a lot better. I can't wait to watch Episode 3!",8,5,8,21 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," fantastic ending of a saga
","A bit more than a year ago, I wrote my comment for Star Wars Episode II. I wrote that Episode I was a good movie, but not Star Wars-good, that Episode II was a lot better and that I couldn't wait to watch Episode III. Episode I was with Jar-Jar and a really annoying Jake Lloyd a movie for the kids, Episode II with waaaaay too much romance and an annoying Christensen was more for the ladies, and Episode III is a movie I adore! It's got great special effects (the vehicles look as 'used' as they did in the original Saga, not so fancy as in Episode I), Christensen has obviously had some great acting lessons, the tad of romance(/drama), although corny ('You've changed', 'You're breaking my heart' and 'I don't know you anymore'), is not irritating (mostly bec√°use it's just a tad this time), the added humor is better than in the two other prequels and the space and light-saber battles are downright amazing! There are some nods to the clone wars, like Anakin's scar, 3PO's new color, the kidnapping of Palpatine and the breathing problems of General Grievous, sadly these nods won't be picked up in many countries (one of my friends asked me, 'if that General Grievous is a robot, why does he seem to be so ill?') since they didn't show up on TV but as I've seen them, I myself can't complain (I downloaded them, as I did with season one and two, these however have just recently made it to DVD in the Netherlands). I love to see the Star Wars Saga completed, and I love that it ended with such a great movie. Two thumbs up!",10,4,11,18 May 2005
