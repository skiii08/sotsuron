Frost_Nixon," Frank Langella IS Nixon
","Frank Langella delivers a stunning performance. For those of us who remember Richard Nixon as President, he comes to life on the screen. The face, the stoop, the mannerisms--they're all there. This is not an actor playing a role; it is as if Nixon himself is on screen. And it's not a wholly unsympathetic portrayal. Nixon does not come off as a monster or as deranged, more as someone to be pitied than despised.The other performances, including Michael Sheen's, are very solid, but Langella has done something truly extraordinary by removing the impression of an actor playing a part. I'll be very surprised if he doesn't earn an Oscar nomination, or even and Oscar as best actor for this performance. Langella has certainly come a long ways from his excellent performance in the underrated 1970 Mel Brooks film, The Twelve Chairs.Forst/Nixon as a whole is riveting. Given that it's a fairly simple story with a known ending, this is quite an achievement. You don't have to be a Watergate junkie to enjoy this film; even a passing familiarity with those momentous events in our history is sufficient. Not a moment of the 122-minute running time is wasted--or dull.",9,2,4,26 December 2008
The Monuments Men," Cloone at his pompous worst
","There is a good idea for a movie here but this wasn't it. It's slow, confusing and boring--and did I say slow? The movie suffers terribly from a self-conscious effort to make viewers grasp the IMPORTANCE of what they're watching, made worse by Clooney's interminable and self-important voice-overs. This is a great cast wasted on what is ultimately a boring docu-drama. It just confirms you should never see a movie where the star is also the director and writer, unless it's Eastwood. Clint would have done something great with this story but Clooney just couldn't--or at least didn't.",5,1,4,23 February 2019
Dawn of the Dead," *Much* better than the original
","For all the hype it gets from its small but devoted cadre of fans, the original Dawn of the Dead is really, really cheesy.  A mall with a gun shop and tons of ammo in it?  A few zombies that move slow as molasses in winter? A helicopter that can take them outta there whenever it gets too dangerous? Where's the terror in that?  Most of the movie is spent playing around in the shopping mall.Not so with the current version.  The zombies here are mean and *fast*--and there are zillions of them.  The terror and despair are real--as is the drama.  Everything is precisely calculated and has its reason.  Characters change as they live under the strain of balancing compassion with survival. Unlike the cardboard cutouts in the earlier version, these are real people confronted with an unimaginable horror.  Some respond better than others, but both the action and the character development make sense and ring true. Even the music is far superior to the original.  This is a masterpiece that has borrowed little more than the title from the original--and a good thing too.",8,0,0,29 March 2004
The Prestige," A sorry excuse for a movie
","There is nothing profound or interesting about this movie. It is choppy and confusing, and seems like it drags on forever. It has long series of plot holes instead of a plot. The two main characters are neither interesting nor likable. The main premise (which leads to the great 'denouement' at the end) is not only obvious, it's ridiculous. The movie says nothing about ambition or the quest for perfection or any of the other deep stuff people pretend to see in it. It's about a couple of guys so consumed by mutual hatred and envy that they can't seem to get a life of their own. This movie makes The Illusionist seem plausible and coherent by comparison. A waste of talent, especially Michael Caine's.",5,10,25,22 October 2006
The Godfather: Part II," Save yourself the 3 hours and 20 minutes
","Confusing, unfocused, repetitive, predictable and most of all interminable. Coppola here tries to meld two unconnected stories into one movie, largely because neither is interesting enough to stand on its own.  Aside from a passable performance by DeNiro, the movie has nothing to commend it.  It's astonishing that it rates among the IMDB top 5 while a really top notch movie like The Sting (1973) rates in the 70s.",6,4,22,29 December 2001
Apocalypse Now," Still incomprehensible after all these years
","Saw it again after 20+ years, and I still don't get it.  Some good scenes, mostly involving Robert Duvall, but if Martin Sheen were any more laid back he'd fall asleep.  As for Brando, it's The Godfather meets Moby Dick--and overblown, incomprehensible performance, much like the movie itself.  If you want to see a movie about 'Nam, Full Metal Jacket is a much better bet.",5,2,8,30 December 2001
Across the Universe," A feast for Beatles fans and maybe also for those who aren't
","I'm not a fan of Julie Taymor (I hated Titus) so I was a bit leery about going to see this movie. Still, as a Beatles fan, I decided I should see it on the big screen. I went with my 19-year-old son, and we both enjoyed it very much. The film is a visual and auditory feast--sort of like a long music video--yet connected by a linear plot and sub-plots. For those of us who came of age during the 'Nam era, this brought back some vivid memories. But it's the music--a continuous parade of Beatles hits--that is the real treat. Somehow the plot, the (sometimes surrealistic) imagery and the music blend together for a sensual tour de force. Don't miss this movie while it's still playing in theaters; it just won't be the same on a small screen.",10,0,2,28 October 2007
Garden State," There's nothing here to like
","It's been a long time since I've seriously thought about walking out in the middle of a movie, but with this film I can mighty close. Instead, I dozed off for a while. There is nothing interesting, novel, imaginative or deep about this movie. It tries very, very hard to be lovable, but succeeds only in being annoying. The plot, such as it is, seems like it was made up by a bunch of college kids sitting around stoned, and the dialogue sounds like it was written on the back of an envelope. Zach Braff looks like he's on a heavy dose of Quaaludes for the entire movie, and pretty much everyone else looks like they forgot to take their Prozac. Worst of all, there was nothing funny about this movie--it's mostly sappy and boring. I thought I had seen the worst movie of the year last week when I saw 'Exorcist: The Beginning' but I found myself longing to be back watching that movie, which at least had some interesting special effects. Miss this movie at all costs.",4,3,6,5 September 2004
Mulholland Drive," A seriously bad movie
","The movie has no plot to speak of.  It's a collage of scenes strung together with the idea that the more confusing it is, the more people will think it's deep.  It's not--it's mostly just silly, shop-worn and entirely lacking in originality; it was old by the time Lynch tried this stuff in the abominable Eraserhead in 1977.  Other than a fine performance by Naomi Watts--totally wasted here--this movie is not worth the 2 hours and 25 minutes out of your life it will take to watch it.  David Lynch hasn't directed movie worth watching since Elephant Man in 1980. Maybe it's about time he hangs it up.",3,0,2,10 March 2002
From Hell," Slow, confusing, overdone, silly
",Johnny Depp struggles his way through the silly plot and slow script. Heather Graham looks lost.  Way over-directed.  Could profitably have been cut by three quarters of an hour.  This film isn't worth the bother.,5,1,3,21 October 2001
Signs," A major disappointment
","I am a fan of Mel Gibson's pretty much since Road Warrior, and I loved Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, so went to see Signs with every expectation of really liking it. It's been a long time since I've been so disappointed in a movie. The story, if you can call it such, moves at the speed of molasses; the director uses every cheap trick of lighting, photography, camera angle and timing to create a tension that really doesn't exit; the movie is full of clichÃ©s, platitudes and just plain silliness; almost everything on the screen is stolen from some other movie--Night of the Living Dead, Children of the Corn, Close Encounters--the list goes on; the plot has more holes than Swiss cheese and in the end you feel cheated by all the contrived sentimentality. Mel Gibson is so inert he almost implodes; Joaquin Phoenix is a joke; the two children (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) fall all over themselves and each other as to which one can be the most precious or the most profound. So much bad acting from what are some pretty good actors must be the fault of the director who obviously wanted to create something with deep meaning but succeeded only in boring me and my wife and sons to tears.***SPOILER***Of all the evasions and implausibilities in the movie, the one that kept bugging us as we discussed it while driving home from the theater is this one: If water has the same effect on the bodies of the aliens that, say, sulfuric acid has on humans, why would they invade a planet that is mostly made up of water and do so in the buff? Couldn't they stop at Wall Mart first and pick up wet suits and umbrellas?",3,1,1,3 August 2002
Windtalkers," Another John Woo Bust
","This movie is way too long and dull.  The battle scenes are well done, but after a while you get bored seeing people shot or torn to bits or bleeding to death.  You want to say 'Enough already.'  The story is weak and character development is pretty much in the cutout mode. Nicolas Cage's big dilemma is no dilemma at all, once you think about it for a minute.  This movie moved me not a bit--except to yawn.",6,0,0,15 June 2002
