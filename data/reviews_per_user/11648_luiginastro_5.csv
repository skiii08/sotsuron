It," 'A great film trapped in a good film'
","I took the liberty to quote Adam from YourMovieSucksDOTorg in the title of the review, because it's exactly what this movie is. A very competent movie with lots of good aspects and potential, but in the end the negatives got in the way of my enjoyment of the flick.The goodDirecting, cinematography and visual effects: the Argentine director Andrés Muschietti, at his second film in his career after the 2013 'Mama', has done a very good job. All I can say is that the movie looks pretty, thanks also to the surprisingly good cinematography of Chung-hoon Chung. Props also to the visual effects department, which created some very eerie and fun to watch visuals.The acting: nobody stands out, except for Bill Skarsgård. He is incredibly creepy and made a perfect Pennywise. Probably it's an unpopular opinion, but I think he's even better than Tim Curry was at playing the iconic demon. The rest of the cast did a fine job too. Even the children, who are well-known to be the worst part in these kinds of movies, are convincing. There's chemistry between them and it was fun to watch them interact with each other. Also, and this is a very person note, I was so glad to see Finn Wolfhard. I really like him in Stranger Things and I'm just happy his movie career started as well.As far as I'm concerned, these are the main aspects where the movie excels. There are also plenty of issues, and those really ruined the movie for me. Let's get into that, shall we?The badClichés: even though the actors did a fine job at portraying their characters, that doesn't mean they were particularly well-written ones. Their backstories were so clichéd, especially the bully type character, whose name I can't even remember. He had no relations to the overarching plot, or at least not one that I could find. I can't fathom why he was so prominently featured. I just didn't care about him.Finally, the biggest and worst flaw in my opinion of this movie is the overuse of jump scares. They had Skarsgård at his finest, being creepy with just a simple expression. However, they felt compelled to use the trite technique of the jump scare, a very cheap way of scaring people. Using jump scares is not clever; it's the easiest and laziest way to get a scare out of your audience. I hate them! They should've used Skarsgård and his creepines more, istead of relying on this horror trope, because they were nervous people wouldn't get scared enough. Such a pity!Overall, this movie is a big missed oppurtunity. If they had made a movie similar to It Follows, for example, I think I would've enjoyed it more. My rating is 5/10.",5,0,1,1 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Ungodly
","The original six moviesI've never been a Star Wars fan. I've watched the original six movies for the first time when I was around 16. I appreciate their importance in cinema history and their cultural impact, but I've never really been invested in the universe.
The Original Trilogy is peak entertainment, as far as blockbusters go. Return of the Jedi is the weakest link, mainly narratively. The Prequels, on the other hand, have very good ideas and concepts, but since George Lucas handled them, the end result is mostly boring. Wooden dialogue, emotionless, we all know they're bad.The Force Awakens and The Last JediThis sequel trilogy is weird to me. I mostly enjoy The Force Awakens. It's derivative, sure, and it feels like a soft reboot. But it was a pretty good stepping stone for these new charismatic characters and plotlines to grow. After the Prequels, it was great to watch a new, entertaining Star Wars movie.The Last Jedi is a mess, no sense in mincing words. There's some good ideas, and there's some bad ones, too. What I enjoy about it is how they handled Luke's character (which I know is a very controversial opinion, bite me) and Rey and Kylo. Everything with them is pretty great. The rest is very hit-or-miss. The theme of the movie is failure and how you should learn from it. So every character fails at something at some point in the movie. This is exemplified by the Canto Bight (is that how it's spelled? Whatever) plotline. But the characters don't learn from that. It's pointless and it destroys the movie's pacing. Everything outside Luke, Rey and Kylo feels pointless, just to pad out the runtime. In a nutshell, I don't hate this movie, nor do I love it.
A spectacular failureFinally, The Rise of Skywalker. I wanted to make an introduction before starting to discuss this last movie of this saga, to give the proper context to my opinion on it.As a movie, it simply fails at being one. Scenes start and end with no continuity; the editing is terrible; the pacing is too quick, to the point of becoming extremely boring very quickly. Are there any positives? Sure, the visuals and the score. That is it. All the problems stem from the terrible script.
The biggest issue of this trilogy is that they didn't plan things out from the get go. J.J. Abrams did his thing with TFA, and so did Rian Johnson. And that's a problem. Why give the second movie in one of the most beloved franchises ever to someone who wanted to tell his own story, in an already well-defined and fleshed out universe? Johnson is talented, but he wasn't the right man for the role. Especially considering that there wasn't any overarching plotlines. It's seriously baffling.
The result is this mess of a movie. Abrams clearly wanted to retcon TLJ but with uninspired, ridiculous and stupid solutions. A lot of scenes made me laugh hysterically because of how ridiculous they were. All the events are a weaker carbon copy of the Original Trilogy, especially Return of the Jedi. The conflict of this new trilogy, overall, is the same of the Original Trilogy. This story had already ended in 1983. They tried to go their own way, they failed miserably and resorted to rehashing the same old Star Wars tropes.Embarrassing, 2/10.",2,8,13,21 December 2019
Dunkirk," Nolan's interesting take on the war genre
","To sum up this movie one only needs five words: it's a war movie. Yeah, that's it. A movie about an important operation, which saved more than 330,000 soldiers from the beaches of Dunkerque, where they were surrounded by the German.From a technical point of view, the quality is impeccable. After all, it's a Nolan movie, so high quality was pretty much guaranteed. The movie is full of visually stunning shots (first one that comes to mind is one at the beach, at the beginning of the film, in which we can see the soldiers and where the frame is interrupted by two pillars or whatever they were; but also all the breathtaking aerial shots). I can't even begin to imagine how hard the production of the movie must have been, which I'd describe as colossal. A few 'action sequences' (I don't how else to call them) are truly incredible to watch. The structure of the plot: this is what makes this war movie unique. It follows three different perspectives (land, sea and air) with overlapping time-periods, which create a non-linear narrative. Usually a war movie follows the actions of a certain group of people throughout its entirety. This is where the only problem I had with the movie arise; I didn't have much time to empathize with any of the characters. I know it's only my problem, because caring for a certain character or characters wasn't the point, but I don't know. I guess I'm used to empathize with at least one of the characters when I watch a movie. But fine, I understand Nolan's choice and I respect it. It's not about the characters and their emotions and personalities whereas it's about their will to survive.The cast: nothing much to say here. Acting is not the focus of the movie, but what little acting we saw was yet again impeccable. We have a few important and famous names, such as Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy, and they all did a very good job. We also have a good variety of new names approaching the silver screen for the first time, such as Fionn Whitehead (who's only 20!) who was extremely good in his role and Harry Styles. A highly criticized choice, but in the end, he was decent. More than decent, actually. A new career may have started. A special mention goes to the astonishing original soundtrack, composed by Nolan's longtime partner in crime, Hans Zimmer. He WILL win the Oscar. Period. It'd be a crime if he didn't. As I've said, he has collaborated with Nolan in many of his movies, for more than a decade now, and every time he outdoes himself. His score accompanies the movie for its entire length and it adds even more tension and anxiety than the incredible images we see on the screen. Just sublime. Overall, this isn't the best war movie ever made; or even the best Christopher Nolan has ever made. By saying this, I don't want to sound incoherent because I really, really liked the film. The only and simple explanation is that I've appreciated more his other works. Watch it if you haven't already.",9,2,4,3 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The worst thing about this franchise is the fans
","People need to stop overhyping this stupid franchise. Star Wars has never been masterful at storytelling, they're just dumb, entertaiting sci-fi movies, with great and compelling characters. Except for the prequels, those suck.There's good stuff in it, there's bad stuff in it. It's fine. Stop insulting people who liked a movie, and vice-versa. Stop making hours-long video nitpicking and dissecting other people's opinions on a damn movie (any reference to MauLer and his cohorts is purely coincidental). Let people think whatever they want. The reaction to Rise of Skywalker will be just as cancerous, I already know it.",6,6,35,29 November 2019
Joker," On the nose, silly and forced
","Phoenix is great. The cinematography as well. That's it.The world described in the film is not realistic, despite what they try to *tell* you. They don't show, they never show. Everything that happens is finalized to sustain Fleck's downfall. It's not organic, it feels forced. A lot of ideas, none of them explored sufficiently.The movie is basically an amalgamation of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Too many scenes that were 'inspired' by those two great masterpieces, that deal with these matters in an actual thoughtful and mature way.
This truly is the 'we live in a society' film.I wanted to like it, I really did. I couldn't. I'm sorry? Go cry in the corner, if you're offended by my opinion.",5,54,112,6 October 2019
