Airlift," Just do not miss this one!
","The film is based on a true event. The film follows Ranjit Katyal (Kumar), a Kuwait-based businessman, carries out a biggest civil operation of evacuation of Indians based in Kuwait during the Iraq- Kuwait war carried out during the reign of Iraqi emperor Saddam Hussein....some stories should be told. It narrated brilliantly. Director Raja Krishna Menon just done a fine job. Akshay Kumar is outstanding. His performance is the soul of Airlift. Undoubtedly an award-worthy act. It surely one of his finest works. How can i forget Prakash Belawade..He is so impressive. Screenplay is really good. Some directional fault i saw but that is forgettable when you watch a movie like this..Airlift is a must watch. I know some guys and obviously some audiences are always want to watch a sex comedy like kya super cool hain hum 3...The film are not for those guys.....Just do not miss this one!",7,4,7,22 January 2016
The Revenant," Alejandro González Iñárritu's brilliant directing and Emmanuel Lubezki's great cinematography makes the movie a perfect one
","The Revenant, a ravishingly violent Western survival yarn from Alejandro González Iñárritu, has a healthy few, scattered like acorns across its two-and-a-half-hour canvas..... no matter how extended, the film's tense story is under the director's complete control...DiCaprio's performance is an astonishing testament to his commitment to a role. cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki done a great job..as a supporting actor tom hardy is brilliant.the movie is nominated for 12 Oscar. Leo has a big chance to win the best actor and i thinks he deserves it. it's proves again Tom hardy is a brilliant actor even he can do it as a villain.i just so much loved this one,hope you like this one...",9,0,4,18 January 2016
