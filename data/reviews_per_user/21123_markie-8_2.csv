One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Cute, smart and great fun.
","From its opening (Pongo searching passers by for an ideal partner for his 'pet' Roger, watching as dogs and owners, looking identical to each other, pass) to its frantic, and yes even scary, chase scene 101 Dalmations is canine riot. In my favourite scene, the movie brings a tear to one's eye. Sweet, moving, and classic Disney.",7,3,4,17 January 2000
Tarzan," Just Perfect - the best Disney, and the best ever :)
","With an opening montage set to the pounding drums of Phil Collins' song Two Worlds, we're awakened to an astounding world. The animation is perfect, the characters superb, and the music is almost primal in the emotions it conjures. Just perfect. Hilarious and moving - heartfelt but action-packed, it's the perfect Disney.",10,1,1,15 January 2000
