Casablanca," Casablanca is a movie that proves that early movies are still the greatest films of all time.
","This movie opens up a gateway to the genre of early romance with light drama. Now it is near impossible to find a movie that was made not for the money, not to win awards, but for the people.At first I thought that this movie was over hyped, but when I sat down and watched it, I realized that the hype was true. This movie delivered everything it promised and then some.The characters were perfect. Believable, realistic, and you felt like you could relate to them in a way. Humphrey Boggart was the best example. His witty yet sarcastic remarks are still known as some of the greatest lines of all time. My personal favorite being 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.' While the movie did start out slow, it quickly picked up and was able to hold my interest. It was dark, yet was able to throw in light humor without upsetting the balance of a scene. Since it was dealing with a serious issue, which at the time was an incredibly important matter, they had to find a way to deal with the issue without upsetting the balance of the film. A feat that they managed to do well.There are many memorable scenes in the movie, but my personal favorite is the very end when Rick has to watch Llsa fly off. It is painful for him, but he knows that her staying would only hurt both of them and due to his character he is able to keep his emotions inept, while conveying in his new friend, Louis.As for changes, I would make none. This film is a masterpiece and wanting to make changes is like editing the Bible or adding finishes to one of Leonardo DaVinici's paintings. As the saying goes 'If it ain't broke don't fix it' I was only 12 when I first saw this film, but I gained much watching it. I learned that while you may not want to do something or say goodbye to someone sometimes it is necessary for the greater cause.This is a movie I would recommend to anyone who wants drama, romance, comedy, memorable dialogue, or just an all around good feeling. This is a movie I will continue to enjoy for years to come.",10,8,12,4 September 2007
The Godfather," The Godfather is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time.
","I have seen it four times and have enjoyed it every single time. In fact if I could only watch three movies for the rest of my life, this would be it along with to Kill A Mockingbird and American Beauty.There are many things that make this movie enjoyable so many things that I have to break it down.The plot. There are few American movies that have a plot as deep and complex as the Godfather. Usually when I don't want to spend 6 dollars to see a movie I'll just go to a website and read a recap, but with this it is impossible. There are more twists and turns then a hamster maze. In fact the first time I watched this I had to pause every 20 minutes just to take in what I was seeing.It delivers what it promises. With 90 percent of today's movies they promise something big and epic, only to fail to deliver. The Godfather sets up high expectations and meets them all and then some. It is impossible to say this movie is over rated, because there isn't a scale in the world that can rate a movie such as this.The characters. Just as a captain is nothing without his crew a movie is nothing without its characters and this movie has some of the most memorable. I cannot possibly have a favorite because they are all incredible. Clearly when casting they chose the best and not the ones that looked good and had six packs.The dialogue. Very few movies have realistic dialogue. They sound rehearsed and forced, but this movie is the exception. The actors were speaking as if this was real life and they were having a realistic conversation. If I didn't know this was a movie I would think that someone had recorded an actual person's life.The action. I won't deny it, I love action and this movie does not fail. The fight scenes were epic and unpredictable. One moment a family could be sitting down to a nice dinner and the next minute machine gun fire could be going everywhere. My personal favorite was when Emilio Barzini was shot and rolled down the stairs.This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone. This is one of the few movies that can please everyone. It has action, romance, comedy, drama, suspense, a deep plot, and a feeling of satisfaction after you see it. If you haven't seen this movie do so as soon as possible this is one film that you can't refuse.",10,0,1,16 September 2007
