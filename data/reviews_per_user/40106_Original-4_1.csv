The Blair Witch Project," Its scary...that it made it to the big screen...
","I have never seen a story where I cared LESS about the main characters, or wished MORE for them all to suffer a terrible death.  Unfortunately, Blair Witch didn't even provide that catharsis.  Failed psychological ploys, in combination with inane dialog, and a plot line as thin as an anorexic on speed make for a story that would be difficult to watch even WITHOUT the jerky camera work.  While its neat that you get the 'handheld HI-8' effect, it doesn't lend itself to easy watching on the big screen.  In fact, if you get motion sickness, stay away.  I expected much more from something hyped as one of the greatest thrillers of all time, and I was sadly disappointed. Perhaps 'Three Morons Lost in the Woods' would have been a more appropriate name for the film.  It would all be worth it if it was at least a little bit frightening, but it even fails at that.  If you want real psychological thrills, rent yourself Psycho or Vertigo and leave the Blair Witch to rest in the woods.",2,0,3,18 August 1999
