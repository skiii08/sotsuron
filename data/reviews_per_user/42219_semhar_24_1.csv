The Hangover," love this film!
","I enjoyed this film, it was hilarious and one of a kind. It made me laugh throughout the entire movie. Defiantly a must see. My favorite part was when they found out who's animal it was in there hotel room and the guys reaction. I especially found it hilarious when the owner of the animal was found in the room. Oh and can't forget the random infant that was found and the baby's mother. Good film, again a must see. I really liked Bradly Cooper's character and Stu who was so uptight but loosened up during the film and truly became himself and seemed happier while being wild. Most movies I don't give such high reviews but this movie defiantly deserved a ten.",10,1,2,19 September 2010
