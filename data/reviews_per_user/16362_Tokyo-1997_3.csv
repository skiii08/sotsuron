The Ring," A terrifying film, though not as good as the original
","I found this movie to be made quite well and quite terrifying. There were lots of jumpy scenes. The opening scene for this movie was done very well. The part where the main character pulls out the hair from her mouth was also done very well. This is the remake of the original film. Though I found this remake to be quite entertaining. There were a few flaws that made it not as good as the original. The opening scene to me in this movie seemed to be the scariest part in the entire film, in fact it was probably even scarier than the scene where the ghost comes out of the TV set. I have read some of the reviews about the wonderful opening scene in this movie, and I agree. However, this whole movie definitely was not as good as the original. Because the scary scene where the ghost comes out from the TV set in the original was much scarier.The storyline of this film is about the same as the original. Here's a comparison between the original and the remake. Original - The man was working on his newspaper articles in a typical house, when the TV showed a picture of a well.You could already see the terror and fear on the man's face. Sadako slowly crawls out of the well and crawls out of the TV maintaining her scary crawling position. She then stands up, with her hair still covered over her face. Her face was not shown. She slowly moves towards the man. The man was shocked and frightened as you could see from his expression. He struggles. Just as you thought that Sadako would move towards the man. No. Sadako twitches her eye and stares at the man. Just as you thought Sadako would move towards him. No, the man faces Sadako, his mouth was forced opened, his heart stopped beating and fell onto the floor with his mouth opened wide.I could not sleep after I watched it Remake- The man was also working on his newspaper articles, when the TV seems to be on, he turns off the TV. He did not look as terrified as the man in the original ringu version. The man even stupidly moves towards the TV. Samumara comes out of the well.(The atmosphere around the well was not dark unlike ringu) Samumara slowly comes out of the TV set. Strange, but the coincidence of the main character trying to call the man to warn him what was about to happen, reduces the tension and fear of that scene. Samumara slowly comes out of the TV set, her hair was still covering her face. She slowly walks towards the man. The man seem to trip over some shelf. The shelf fell onto the ground with a crashing sound.This part reduces even more tension and fear of that scene. The camera angle was then not right. The scene then shows Samumara's feet walking towards the man.(also reduces tension) The man then tries to hide. Up to here , the scene was still very scary. What comes next became a disappointment to me in comparison to the original. Sadako slowly raises her head, with anger, her entire face was shown(Sadako's hair was still covering her face in the original version).Then some crappy special effects occurred without even mentioning what happened to the man unlike the original. The ending for the remake was also disappointing compared to the original.there were a few plot holes in the movie. Firstly, the video which the main character watched left many questions in my mind. What has the centipede got to do with the plot for this movie? What has the ladder even got to do with the movie? What has the finger piercing the nail or even the housefly has got to do with the movie? I personally think the special effects were overly done in that video for the remake. Some parts like the mother pushing Samumara down the well was pretty unexpected. I love that twist, because all the while I thought the father was the one who did it. This twist was not used in the original. I love the creepy atmosphere being used throughout the entire movie. I love the tension and fear that builds up in this movie. I love the characters being used in this movie, Samumara really looked scary. I love the character development and the storyline used in this movie. I thought there were lots of character development. Base on cultural interest, the original has done a much better job than the remake. Overall, I found this to be quite a nice movie, but the original was three times better than this. This movie is still recommended, but I highly recommend one to see the original first before you see the remake. My scores for the ring series so far would be: Japanese version of ringu- 9/10 Japanese version of ringu 2- 7/10 The ring(remake)-7.7/10 The ring two(remake)-7.1/10",7,1,2,17 October 2010
12 Monkeys," What a boring movie
","This is probably one of the most boring and ridiculous movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I cannot understand anything about this movie. I was expecting monkeys to pop out and attack human beings in this movie. But no. There was just nothing. The whole movie is about a man who tries to stop something from happening in the future. The idea for this movie is decent. However, this movie is just awful because for almost the entire movie was just engulfed with dialogs and long boring sill dialogs. Even the song at the ending credits in this movie was just plain awful. The only good thing about this movie is that this movie has its mystery elements the idea used in this movie is good. Overall I really dislike this movie. Score: 4/10",4,1,7,14 October 2010
Inception," Sorry, but this movie did not work for me.
","I have heard many good reviews about this movie but somehow this movie just did not work for me. I watched this movie two months ago in a nearby theatre with my sister. My sister found this movie to be a brilliant one but not me. The idea used in this movie is a good one, the storyline is decent and the special effects used are creative and well done. I like the dreamlike quality of this movie. The anti-gravitational scenes and one scene where stuff starts to explode all over the place was well made. This movie has got a lot of action taking place with some interesting violent scenes. The ending was a very well done and unique one. However, there are just to many things I did not like about this movie so it did not really work for me. This movie is far too complicating, possibly one of the most complicating movies I have ever seen. I have to watch the movie and try to fit in the pieces of jigsaw puzzle for this movie at the same time. I found it very difficult to understand what each character was doing, and what happened. One of the most difficult to understand scenes include the scenes around the first few minutes. The opening scene during the first few minutes was just confusing. I love the idea used in this film though and the spinning of the top was interesting. However this movie is just too confusing from the start to the end credits that it just did not work for me. Sorry. I still would recommend this movie due to its originality though. Score: 6/10",6,7,11,13 October 2010
