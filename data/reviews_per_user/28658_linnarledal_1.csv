Mission: Impossible III," This movie will definitely make it to my top 10.
","I've never actually liked the Mission Impossible movies.. until I saw this one! I absolutely Loved it. My friend forced me to go see it this evening and I wasn't thrilled. But, the moment the movie started, I was trapped. I was sweating after just a few seconds and I started dancing to the theme song (dum dum dududum dum dudu) Of course, there are some things that are just over the top, and I was just sitting there and thinking 'Oh my God, that can soooo not happen in real life, that's just too much', but that's just the thing about this movie. It's so cool and just.. wow! The cars are smoking hot (the orange Lamborghini to name one), the actors are ice cold and the action never stops. I'm not really a fan of movies with a lot of action and guns and stuff like that, but this one was just... wow. Tom Cruise is not very beautiful in real life(OK, maybe just a little), but in this movie (or in all Mission Impossibles) he's really sexy. I really recommend you to go see this movie. P.s Mission Impossible 3 is almost too hot.",10,0,2,6 May 2006
