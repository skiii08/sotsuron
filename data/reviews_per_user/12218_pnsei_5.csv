Scarface," Greatest Gangster Movie
",If you want to see a Cuban run the drug game then this is the best movie to do so. I absolutely loved Al Pacino in this role and he is a legend for it. I strive to be like him everyday.,10,0,0,18 August 2018
Deadpool 2," Funniest Superhero Movie This Year
",This movie was so funny but it still sent me on a rollercoaster of emotions. I shed tears of laughter and sadness. Ryan Reynolds is a master at his craft and there should be more Deadpool movies because they keep bringing me back to the theater for more. You will not be disappointed. Please take the time to watch this fantastic film.,10,1,3,18 August 2018
Dunkirk," Another Good War Movie
","This movie is so great the first time you watch it. You can feel the emotion and struggle that the soldiers went through in Dunkirk. BUT when you watch it the second time you can see the foreshadowing that you missed the first time and it makes the movie 1000 times better. If you are confused after the first watch, have no fear and watch again. You will not regret this at all. A masterpiece.",10,1,4,18 August 2018
Saving Private Ryan," Ol' Tommy Strikes Again
",The opening scene is thrilling. This is easily Ol'Tommy's best film since the original Toy Story film. He shows some raw emotion that makes you feel like you are in France with him. This film will forever go down as the pinnacle of war films.,10,1,1,18 August 2018
12 Strong," Such an Amazing Movie
","This movie literally made me want to run through a wall. It was so intense that I felt like I could ride a horse into gunfire. If you want to get all jazzed up and excited from a good, old fashioned war movie with a fantastic lead then this is your film. 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND",10,0,3,18 August 2018
