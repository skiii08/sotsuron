The Ring," Do not let this movie's PG-13 Rating fool you!
","I went into this movie hoping not to fall asleep due to my preconception based on the rating. Every notion I had flew out the window in the first 5 minutes of the movie. This movie is scary! Finally, a film that claims horror and delivers horror!! I give major props to Verbinski on his directing. The symbolism in this movie comes at you from every angle,from the apartment number to the picture drawings, from cinematography to sound. Speaking of sound, a huge heads up to the sound crew in reference to the music and emphasis on basic movie sound. Particularly the scene on the ferry where the horse jumps over the side of the boat. This movie holds nothing back, and its about time! After all the Screams, and I Know What you Did's.....a refreshing breath of suspenseful air! Major props to this movie!",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
