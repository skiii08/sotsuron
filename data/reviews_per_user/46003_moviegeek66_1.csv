Stop-Loss," Poorly developed and too long
","I think the movie started off well but then started to become very tedious and too long. Also the story was not developed well enough for Ryan Philippe's character to suddenly rebel against the fact that he was required to go back. Here is an all American hero, who voluntarily signed up to serve , is a natural leader and all of a sudden throws a fit because they asked him to go back? Why? Because he saw one of his buddies get killed in a chase? Instead he goes off with his pal's girl, setting the stage for a number of infidelity scenes, which to the dismay of the male viewer never comes to fruition, and then in the most anti-climatic fashion he makes yet another u-turn?Like so many other Hollywood movies they could have easily made this movie more plausible, but true to the commercial Hollywood spirit they chose to appeal to our primitive senses instead of our intellect.How Sad.",5,3,4,19 November 2008
