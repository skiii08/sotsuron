Requiem for a Dream," Not perfect but good.
","I really was excited to watch this movie because the reviews were positive. Many people said it was hard to watch but I didn't think it was that hard to watch. I did not cry nor got really emotional at the end which surprised me. Maybe because I had to take bathroom brakes and had to stop the movie once in a while. Maybe I was expecting it to be a super great movie but I guess there is no perfect movie in the world. Well anyways I'm going to list the pros and cons.Pros -Creative jump cuts/videography -Great acting -Interesting plot line that somehow gets you hooked even though sometimes you don't want to watch it at the same time. -Has a moral message unlike other modern moviesCons -Sometimes the jump cuts were annoying and I just wanted to see more continuous dialog. -Obviously not great for families -The reason why I didn't cry is because I don't think there was a great consequence to these people. The person who I felt most bad for is the grandma because she becomes paranoid and it's just hard to watch. However the other characters just go to jail, gets arm amputated, and the girl just becomes promiscuous. Other than the fact that the love relationship between the guy and the girl just becomes ruined, I do not feel emotional about the three people.Overall it's a great movie to watch by yourself. turn the lights off, go to the bathroom before the movie because that would make it more emotional.",8,1,2,17 February 2011
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," One of the best movies I've ever seen
","Fist of all, let me say that this movie might not be everybody's cup of tea. It might be very slow, boring, and meaningless to some people, but I enjoyed it very much (and I'm a teenager). On the surface it might seem boring because it consists many short scenes unrelated to each other centered around Button, and at the end of the movie it might seem stupid because it never really ends in a solid conclusion. However, the reason I enjoyed this movie very much is because it contains many symbolisms and deeper meaning to the movie. I would definitely recommend you to look up the symbolisms of the humming bird, the clock, the guy who repeats that he got struck by lightning many times. Also I would also recommend to see if Button actually defeats time, (is he really getting younger, or is he actually getting older?). Also it is a beautiful film with some humor, and romance.I would recommend anyone to watch this alone, in you're room, without any distractions when you have time (it is a long film). It is a chill film that doesn't really have a climax. I would also recommend you to view it multiple times because it has many, and I quote, MANY symbolisms.",10,1,3,22 June 2011
Grave of the Fireflies," I hate this movie!
","The reason why I rated 10 stars while hating this movie is because it was so sad. I knew that it was a sad movie, multiple times I was warned by other people. I knew that the Main character, the mom, the dad, and his sister was going to all die. BUT I still was emotional. I thought i was ready for this movie since I watched war movies like Valkyrie, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,and Life is Beautiful. However this one made me the most emotional since I knew what was going to happen. The part where the main character was burning her sister was real painful to watch. Maybe because I watched it in Japanese that it was so emotional, but many American viewers say that they cried too so they must of done a good job in translating. I would recommend this movie to people who wants to cry because they are too happy in their life.",10,0,1,28 August 2010
Inception," Beautiful Sexy Gorgeous film.
","This movie was a 10 star movie from the beginning to the end, no doubt. Those people who rated 1 star because they broke down the story line in to facts and stats to make it simpler and say that this movie was a pointless simple movie are just dumb idiots. It's like breaking down a joke so it's not funny anymore, you need to look at the big picture! Also those people who say this movie wasn't original at all and rated 1 start for that also needs to shut up because there are millions of movies out there and to make a movie with out any similarities is impossible.Now I'm going to mention the pros of this movie. The first thing that standed out for me was the amazing graphics and scenery, in my opinion it was far better than avatar. The acting was great and there was no cheesy scenes and stuff. It wasn't boring to watch at all even if you didn't get the plot lines because it was filled with action through out the whole movie. The plot was excellently interesting and kept my eyes on the whole movie.Now to the cons. There were only 3 times i laughed through out the whole movie, so if you're a comedy guy than don't watch it, but the action part makes up for it. It wasn't really a mind-bending movie as it was advertised but more of an action movie with an actual plot that was good. The one thing that was complicated for me was the relationship between cobb and mal. Maybe i'm too dumb but it seemed like mal died 10 times through out the movie and i couldn't tell which one was the dream and whose dream and what not. BUt there is nothing else that i can complain about inception.Overall this movie is a masterpiece and i hope chirtopher nolan can keep up his excellent job.",10,1,5,9 August 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Best Movie I have ever seen!
","This movie was clearly the best movie I've ever seen. I watched it because it was number 1 on IMDb. Turns out my favorite movies like the return of the king, Forrest Gump, or the dark night didn't even come close to it. Why can't movie directors now days make such a good movie like this anymore? I would definitely recommend people to watch this if you like serious movies or meaningful movies. But if your the type of person who has ADHD and can't stand watching a talking scene for 10 seconds, i wouldn't recommend this to you. I would warn you that this is a long movie and it's not meant to watch it in birthday parties unless if your friends are all nerds or serious people. Also don't let your parents see it because there are many swear words in it, with some violence and almost a gay sex-scene. Other wise this movie is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,1,4 April 2010
