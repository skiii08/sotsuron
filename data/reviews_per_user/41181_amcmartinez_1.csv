Despicable Me 2," 2 words: Awesome & Adorable!
","I really loved this movie! It was hilarious and at some moments had me rolling on the floor going 'No! They didn't!' I was dazzled by the first Despicable Me and I can honestly give the producer 2 thumbs up and a job well done! it's not often that you find sequels as good as it's original,But Despicable Me 2 simply blew me away!Though the format of Despicable Me in General is more 'cartoony' it's graphics is major eye candy. It's fun ,creative, and mesmerizing. The minions are just too cute! Their random moments and constant talk of gibberish adds much comedy and gives DM that 'exciting glow'. I really liked how they continued the plot of Gru transforming from Super villain mastermind to Super hero father.Even though Despicable Me 2 is hilarious it has it's moments where the characters are going through something in life that's relatable to real people (younger and older).Whether it's going through first crushes, dealing with maturing kids , getting back into the dating game ,and even realizing your true love Despicable Me 2 offers the whole family a great relatable experience.Lucy Wilde was an awesome new character to enter Despicable Me.She had a lot of spunk and a eager outgoing personality. The trio of girls Margo ,Edith ,and Agnes definitely got to show off more of who they were even though I wish they still had just a bit More depth to their characters.I was actually surprised Margo, usually the sensible one ,became love struck and lost some sensibleness upon meeting Antonio.But hey! That's how most girls are when they get their first crush: infatuated puppy love! Although I really enjoyed this movie ,rabid purple minion creatures and all,it was kinda predictable .Most of the trailers I hate to say was a sum of the entire movie! That part was just a tad bit of a downer but I still liked Despicable Me 2 all the same.Oh and just saying parents beware.I'm not much of a negative thinker but the part where Gru has to use his belt to find traces of the mutation formula ...um ...it kinda looked like he was humping stuff.There's some more little hoo ha's here and there but that's why it's rated PG. I <3 this movie! Hopefully we'll be seeing a DM3 real soon!",9,0,0,1 January 2014
