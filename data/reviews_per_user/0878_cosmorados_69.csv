The King's Speech," no explosions, no bikini clad women, no giant robots, but no competition
","Prince Albert, the second son of George V and Duke of York is set to give a speech at the close of the Wembley exhibition, however, due to a debilitating speech impediment, it is an unmitigated disaster. Thus begins the story of his search for someone to help him overcome, what was for him, the worst possible affliction imaginable. After vowing no more, his wife, Elizabeth, seeks out one last man to try and help cure her husband of his stammer, the unconventional, Lionel Logue. After meeting with him, she agrees to get her husband to see him and we see his progress with the therapist during the backdrop of both political upheaval abroad and constitutional upheaval at home.This is an absolute cracker of a film. Sometimes, in fact let's be honest, very often when films are crazily over-hyped, you do tend to go into them feeling jaded and cynical even before the first scene is over, but in this case, due to the superb performance of Colin Firth, you really feel for Berty, and the journey he takes with Lionel pulls you in from the moment that Geoffrey Rush appears as the scally Australian with a cheeky temperament but a heart of gold, and again, it is stunning work by Rush, who finally after years of having to mess around with the accents of others finally comes home to his own voice. All the supporting cast play their part in making the film as good as it can be, but make no mistakes this is Firth and Rush's film and they turn 2 hours of what could have been tedium into an absolute showstopper of script and performance. Tom Hooper as director deserves special praise for managing to get not just one but potentially two Oscar winning performances out of his actors and put them onto the screen without any of the direction seeming to get in the way. There aren't any jazzy fancy cuts, or anything to distract from what you're seeing. It's just kept nice and simple and is perfect in tone.The only downside if their is one, is that I was so tense for the end speech that I almost couldn't enjoy it. But that said, that is a minor beef. The upside being I was so into it, that I wanted to watch it again after it had finished.An absolute delight.",9,2,4,26 January 2011
Source Code," Aaaagh! It's in my head!
","Captain Colter Stevens wakes up on a train next to an attractive woman he seems to know relatively well, apart from the fact that she keeps calling him Sean, what's with that? Oh and he doesn't know who he is or how he got there, and after a mere 8 minutes he is ripped apart along with every other passenger on the train by a huge explosion. He then 'Wakes up' in some kind of capsule to be told he is part of a test operation called Beleaguered Castle and what he has experienced is reality inside what's called the source code and is reliving the last 8 minutes of life of some other poor soul who was killed on the train. His mission, find and identify the bomber.And that's it. Owing more to the Matrix than inception the writer, Ben Ripley, and Director, Duncan Jones have crafted an almost top-drawer thriller that stays with you long after you've left the cinema. Unlike some of the other semi-recent disaster/thriller's I have seen, namely 'Knowing' and 'The Adjustment Bureau' the problems that both those films had was the reliance of some kind of benevolent alien/god type figures controlling everyone's lives. This film sweetly side-steps that pitfall and so were just left to enjoy the tense tale of this man's last eight minutes on earth. The direction is tense, claustrophobic at times but, like Jones' previous effort, 'Moon', it's the humanity at the heart of it that pulls us in.Credit to Gyllanhall (Is that spelt right?) for giving yet another interesting performance but also credit due for me to Vera Farmiga who as his superior gives a performance that in a way everything hinges on. In many ways she is the unsung hero of this film and she, probably more than the cute looking Monaghan is really the second co-star. Everyone else does there job well, but the best thing about this film is that I found it stayed with me long after I'd seen it and was filled with a need to watch is again.Could have been standard predictable fare, but left me asking more questions at the end of it. Always a good thing.",8,1,3,6 April 2011
Raiders of the Lost Ark," An ancient artifact, a lost love and the greatest villains of all time.
","A man, who we do not see, and two of his colleagues, who seem dodgy at best, are going through a unspoiled jungle landscape, following a map that has seen better days, as it is in three pieces. What they are searching for we do not know, but from the feel of the early scenes, we know it is something of value. After one of the men tries his luck at betrayal and pulls a pistol, he has it whipped out of his hand by the faceless man, who walks into the light to reveal Harrison Ford's second great screen persona, Indiana Jones.Indy is searching for a lost archaeological treasure, an ancient idol, a statue of a little yellow god and when watching the beginning, one cannot help think of mad Carew, as Indy braves the traps to get to the treasure. The rest of the sequence is one that has been seen time and again in movie folklore, and it kicks off the following proceedings in an apt and exciting way.What follows is one of the greatest action movies of all time, but why? The treasure Indy goes after, the Lost Ark, is one that almost everyone can relate to, the box that contains the ten commandments that Moses brought down from whatever mountain it was. What is in the box is sought by the most evil villains in film or real history, the Nazis, who are searching for every manner of religious artifact they can get their hands on for Hitler, who was a nut on the subject, even though the very artifact they are after is a Jewish artifact (A clever twist by the writers)the action sequences are amazing and still gripping every time I watch them, even now, with an ending to die for, for those that haven't seen it, you're in for a treat! The action in the film takes place in the desert of Egypt as Indy tries to find and keep hold of the ark before the Nazis do, there is drama and romance, comedy and tragedy, and the performances and direction are almost perfect, but special mention has to go to Joun Williams amazing score. If a man reaches a peak of achievement where he can do no wrong, then this was John Williams as he did the music to 'Empire' and 'Raiders' and the work on both is exceptional as the score perfectly compliments and enhances every scene, movie students everywhere should make a mental note to watch the Map room sequence.It is brilliant.Raiders may have been dulled by sequels, but the magic of this one should not be ignored and can't be, it;s just too good, so ignore what Spielberg said recently about the Matte work and just enjoy a great film, that needs no special edition and no replacing guns with walky-talkies.Nuff said.",9,0,0,18 June 2008
Casablanca," Flawed Classic
","Firstly the plot. The story of Rick, a man who is ravaged by despair and regret running a bar in Casablanca, a city run by occupied France. Enter a resistance hero, Victor Laszlo, needing two letters of transit to escape to America to carry out a propaganda war against the Nazi's after fighting and resisting them as they marched through Europe unopposed. As Rick winds up with the letters and has fought for noble causes in the past it should be relatively easy to get out for the hero. But as the resistance fighter's escort is Rick's long lost love, Ilsa Lund, nothing is going to go smoothly. Let's get one thing straight about this film, while the plot is fantastic, The cast do make it better. If you take some of the moments of bad dialogue in this movie and look at it on face value, then what you've got on paper is a contender for one of the hammiest films of all time, and sadly Ingrid Bergman gets landed with all of the crap lines.However, the classic moments thankfully outweigh the bad ones, Peter Lorry and Bogies chat at the chess table and subsequent arrest 'I stick my neck out for nobody' the superb moment with Captain Renault as Rick looks after the plane leaving with longing etched into every line on his face, the incredible scene at the roulette table which makes my stomach do somersaults every time I see it 'Have you tried 22?' and my personal favourite, the underrated Victor Laszlo's impassive response when informed that the man that would save him and Ilsa has been killed in custody 'Is that all?' is a great response when you consider what he has just heard.Overall, for me, this is not in the league of 'The Big Sleep' which matches Casablanca for classic moments and arguably has the better lines, but it still does not take away the fact that this is a classic, albeit a flawed one.",8,0,4,27 May 2008
Kung Fu Panda," I am not a fat panda ...I'm THE fat panda. Very close to great, but with a few minor quibbles.
","Po dreams of a life of action where his Kung Fu skills are so awesome that they blind his opponents with their awesomeness, however during the day in his waking hours he is a mere waiter at a noodle restaurant, with his father is on the verge of telling him the secret ingredient to his famous noodle soup. However, after the legendary Kung Fu master Oogway has a vision that the Kung Fu criminal Tai Lung, is about to escape, a ceremony is held to find the new DRAGON WARRIOR! Desperate to see the outcome Panda crashes the ceremony and is inadvertently picked to become the dragon warrior of legend. However due to the fact that he knows no Kung Fu and is only successful in getting his butt kicked, it seems there is little chance of him saving the Dragon Scroll from falling into Tai Lung's hands.This is a skillfully crafted movie that is very funny, touching in parts, and beautifully made. The performance from Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane are all first rate and they, along with Randall Duk Kim as the awesome Master Oogway are first rate. The supporting cast of David Cross, Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan and Lucy Lui have little to do in their roles, but do it well, with Rogen yet again getting the best out of the little screen time he has. Angelina Jolie for me is the only disappointment in the film as she clearly does not have a voice that lends itself well to animation. The moments of action and tension are impeccable with a sense of danger that, for me, is more real than anything in 'The Incredibles', with the two big stand-out scenes being the bridge showdown and the 'You are free to eat' sequence which is clever, moving and performed with a real sense of panache by both the voice artists and the animators. The score is also brilliant and in depth and tone is very much like 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' in it's subtleties and complexity.Another thing that this film does not suffer from and is a problem in a number of other fight movies is that thing were a bad guy appears awesome earlier in the film, then goes cr*p right before the end fight, leading to an easy win for their opponent, like in 'The Forbidden Kingdom'. In this film, we understand how the fight goes the way it does as it is clear from everything that has gone before why things move the way they do in the universe.Sadly with Wall-E Pixar have not just raised the bar but placed it on a skyscraper which then makes a film like this seem, well, mediocre, when in truth, it's not. This is a well-written and superbly directed film that is worthy of the high marks it is getting on this board.Although it is my second favourite animated film of the year, there is nothing about it that is second rate.You are free to enjoy the film.",8,0,1,3 January 2009
Star Trek," For new fans it's awesome! for old fans, still awesome, but kind of familiar!
","The USS Kelvin is flying through space only to discover an uncharted anomaly. When a gigantic ship appears and attacks the Kelvin it looks curtains for the crew. However under the stewardship of temporary Captain George Kirk, most of the crew aboard are saved, including his wife and new-born son. Years of struggling to come to terms with his father's loss sees James T Kirk rebellious, distrustful and lost, until father figure Captain Christopher Pike dares him to enlist in star fleet and better his father's heroic achievement. Here he meets his best friends Bones McCoy and a young upstart Vulcan called Spock whose officiousness and efficiency are in stark contrast to Kirk's wild abandoned approach to life and to rules.Thus begins the re-imagining of the Star Trek film series (I hate calling them a franchise...It's not McDonalds!) by J J Abrams. Being the creator of lost one might imagine this would be a convoluted mess of a film, however what comes across in this film is clearly J J's passion for the history and tradition of what the original material was about which has lead to a lot that is praiseworthy about it and just a little that isn't.First I'm gonna get the negative out of the way. The film does feel a bit familiar. The big ship at the beginning and the music used is very 'Star Trek: the motion picture', the Kobyoshi Maru' is very 'Star Trek 2' and the whole end with Kirk at the academy is very 'Star Trek 4'. The whole snow planet thing does feel a bit contrived to bring another character into it, and Nero is no Khan or Chang in terms of great Star Trek villains.Negatives out of the way lets get onto the positives, and oh boy, the positives! Firstly the script and writing feel great, most of the references and the very few in-jokes work fabulously well. The performances in all the supporting roles, Sulu, Chekov, Scotty and Uhura are exemplary and they all play so well, in a film that could feel heavy or laden due to the complexities of the characters relationships. Now, lets get to the key triumvirate, McCoy, Spock and Kirk. These three performances steer the film along and make us feel like the original crew are still on board that ship. They work so damned well that I almost feel disloyal for enjoying them so much.And now for the last crew member. The USS Enterprise. In all the good Trek films the Enterprise shots are things of beauty to behold, and this film is no exception. In battle mould, she looks stunning, in Warp drive she looks like an angel surrounded by light, it's so powerful. The direction of the rest of the team by J J is also glorious with the cinematography resembling the stunning photography and lighting used in Die Hard with arcs and halo's aplenty.This is a great, great, blockbuster and one of the best Star Trek films ever, right up there with the unofficial trilogy of 2, 3 and 4.May the new Star Trek live long at the cinema and Prosper.",8,1,8,17 June 2009
12 Angry Men," You're not really going to kill me are you?
","This is one of those great films that, at the time it is made, tackles a difficult subject, but does so in such a way that it becomes that subject's definitive movie reference point.The story focuses on a young boy who is charged with murdering his father. Given a public defender as he cannot afford legal counsel, the case seems to be open and shut. He didn't know the films he saw on the night he was supposed to be at the pictures, he had bought the knife that was similar to the one that killed his father, he was experienced in using a knife and 2 witnesses saw him kill his father and flee the scene. Chances of mistakes, well, let's face it none. He'll be found guilty and as it is murder he will go to the electric chair.In Sidney Lumet's supreme drama 12 men hold the fate of this boy in their hands and within a claustrophobic room on a hot summers day the discussions that take place are more gripping than a hell of a lot of bland action films who rely on special effects rather then script, storytelling or performance. The acting within this drama is superb and Henry Fonda is magic as Juror number 8 who has some doubt as to the guilt of the accused. Everyone in the room is superb in their role, with a special nod to Jack Klugman as the guy from a poor background who knows the kind of area the kid comes from, Joseph Sweeney as the shrewd eyed Juror number 9 is also fantastic, but for me E.G.Marshall and Lee J. Cobb (Arguably the most underrated American character actor) are magnificent in their roles as Juror's 4 and 3, the clever juror who takes careful consideration of the evidence and Lee J, consumed by anger over his own child's independence and taking that out in the jury room.It is a fine film that has stayed the test of time that, although some of our current generation may find stagy and un-dynamic, is still as appealing as ever for a generation who enjoy having the cinema do some thinking with them about our world, and not necessarily for them.",9,0,0,17 June 2008
Spider-Man 2," A Sequel that almost surpasses the original
","Peter Parker's life should be on the up. He is in love with a beautiful woman, he is at college studying exactly what he wants under a professor who understands his abilities, oh, and he also has superpowers and masquerades as a superhero. What could possibly be wrong with this perfect life, apart from everything. His best friend Harry is alienating him because he thinks Spider-man killed his father, his professor thinks he's lazy and his potential girlfriend is about to marry someone else. Everything is turning sour until he meets a scientific genius named Otto Octavius who has invented a way to make fusion energy work by creating pocket suns. However, after his experiment goes wrong with tragic consequences, the robotic spine and arms he used to help in his experiments take control of him turning him into Doctor Octopus.In this, Spider-man's second outing the storyline is based on the classic story 'Spider-Man No More!' with one of the definitive comic book covers. As such this means that, for me, their is a section in this movie that dragged the first time I watched it, which is when Spidey hangs up his tights and tries to find his place in the world as Peter Parker. However on a more recent perusal of this film I had less of a problem with it, so it may be a case of it growing on you over time. The script is almost equal to the first in it's diligent attempt to get the best Spider-Man has been in the comic books and transfer it to the big screen, the actions sequences in this one and the effects by far outstrip everything in the first one and they reflect everything that was good about the comic book with Doc Oc and Spidey going at it on tall buildings looking even better than one could ever imagine it. The cast do a sterling job and Alfred Molina joins the able cast and gives a show-stealing performance as the nutty Doc Oc.The only downside I feel is that all of this great stuff does take a while to set up and because of that I have had to reduce it by a point. That said this is still one of the best superhero sequels of all time and for me what gives it that little bit extra is the look of concern on Mary Jane's face as he leaves the apartment to tackle more bad guys. It is the look of a woman fearful that she may not see the man she loves again and is played to perfection by Kirsten Dunst and really gives the ending a bittersweet feel that could have been missed by any other director, but not by the man who loves the Spider, Sam Raimi.Excellent work.",9,3,4,25 July 2008
Hot Fuzz," The Greater Good! 'Shut it!' - One of the best comedies for the last 20 years
","Detective Nicholas Angel is an exceptional officer. So much so that he is promoted and moved to Sandford, Gloucester as a punishment for making his fellow officers look decidedly shoddy by comparison. In Sandford the pace of country life is downright sedate and the crime rate is practically zero. However upon arrival it appears that while the crime rate is exceptionally low, the accident rate is sky high. Could it all be a huge coincidence or is there something much more sinister afoot. With the assistance of the chief constable's inept son, Danny Buttermen, an action movie nut who thinks that being a cop is all car chases and gunfights, Seargent Angel has to uncover the truth before another mysterious accident happens to him.After writing, starring and directing 'Shaun of the dead' Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg turn their sights to the action/comedy genre, transposing the usual American fare and bringing it to a rustic English setting. Simon Pegg decides in this film to take more of a straight man role and leaves most of the comedy to his friend Nick Frost, who does not let him down giving what could just have been the stooge role of Danny Butterman a great deal of charm and pathos. The rest of the supporting cast do their jobs supremely well, from the Oscar-winning Jim Broadbent, through to Olivia Coleman, Kevin Eldon, Anne Reid, Adam Buxton, Bill Bailey and the supremely brilliant Timothy Dalton who excels as the seemingly obvious villain of the piece. The script and the direction are superb and the film switches effortlessly between comedy and action and occasionally horror. The other mistake that the film so deftly avoids is the desire to slap some kind of love interest in there. By doing this it doesn't muddy the waters and simply lets the film stride those two genre's without having to pause for some pointless sub-plot.Like all the best films this is one that gets better with subsequent viewings although just extolling the virtues of this film was not the main reason for my review. The main reason is to clarify one thing that always gets my goat about so many of these reviews. Many people refer to this film as a spoof. Let's be clear about this, Edgar, Nick and Simon are, undoubtedly fans of this genre and wanted to do their own homage to the films that gave them all so much joy and entertainment. In doing it not as a spoof (a la Epic Movie) and instead relishing the genre itself they have created a film that can hold it's head high with the best of this genre that the US has produced over the last 20 thirty years.As Nicholas Angel says ...Punch that sh!t! Awesome!",9,4,8,16 October 2010
L.A. Confidential," In common with all great films...
","It's distinction is its lack of a bad scene. This is one of those films that is great to watch and familiarise yourself with and then comeback to later on. The film itself is made exceptional by a cast that you the viewer seem unable to take your eyes off as the film progresses.In this film there are a number of great performances but three in particular are exceptional. Guy Pearce as Lt. Exley is perfectly cast as the ambitious young cop anxious to prove himself better than even his father's fearsome reputation, with Kevin Spacey in equally fine fettle as the movie star of cops, Jack Vincennes, using every ounce of charm to create a Dino-esquire portrayal that's perfect in this period piece. But the tour-De-force of performances comes from a man so chilling in his ability to switch from hostile to psychopathic in seconds is Russell Crowe as Bud White. Before seeing this film I had never seen Crowe in anything and wondered where the hell he had come from and who he was, as his portrayal of White is one of the best I have ever seen, so complete is his immersion in the skin of this viscous detective.Through the eyes of these cops we see a town where, as the poster says, everything is for sale, everyone has a price and nothing is what it seems.For anyone thinking of giving this film a try who may have missed it the first time round it is well worthy of a viewing.Nuff said.Em",9,2,3,6 June 2008
Alien," I can't lie to you about your chances, but... you have my sympathies.
","The commercial mining ship and refining ship the Nostromo is returning to home through the outer rim. The ship's crew of seven are in hyper-sleep, only called to action in the most dire emergency, with the ship running on automatic, the corridors empty, the bridge lifeless. Until an alien SOS is broadcast and the crew's blissful slumber is broken so that they can help. The crew clearly don't like each other and this is not a Star Trek style Utopian existence, they are co-workers cast together, they do the job and live to together in a clutch of uneasy alliances.As they realise they are not near home and have been awoken for another reason, they are, by the nature of their contracts, required to investigate. A three man team is assembled but as time goes on and more of the alien message is deciphered it appears that it is not an SOS but a warning, and from this point on claustrophobic movies will never be the same again.Alien is one of the greatest horror films of all time, preying on all of our most primeval fears, fear of the unknown, fear of being eaten and fear of something inside destroying us, all of these fears are on show here with perhaps the most prevalent being the fear of the dark which this film does supremely well, without it being so dark that you can't see what is happening (A la 'Alen 3). The script builds up slowly but purposely allowing the feeling of unease to grow inside us but without being boring or tiresome. The performances are all top notch with all the leads doing their jobs to perfection, with everyone playing their parts like it's a kitchen sink drama which again, makes the horror that much more terrifying as the ordinariness of the performances leads to terror that we can relate to perfectly.I can't remember much about the score but it does not detract nor take anything away from the film so I guess it must be good. The direction is Ridley Scott's best ...Yes, better than 'Blade Runner' and better than 'Gladiator'. However, although this film is Ridley's best work, it hasn't lead to a career of mediocrity, rather a career that has lead to quality, consistency and continued invention.Aliens is okay and three and four aren't worth looking at, but thirty years later this is still a chilling and inventive horror that is as unsettling to watch as it is enjoyable.PS Final thought. Sigourney's dressing in the space suit is still one of the sexiest scene's in cinema history, and I still don't know why?",9,0,1,12 July 2008
Forrest Gump," Overpaid, over-rated and over here!
","I remember hearing so much about this film and after a great year at the box office that had seen the release of Pulp Fiction and the underrated intersection, I thought that this film, from the director of 'Back to the future' would surely not fail to the disappoint.Boy was I wrong. Bob Gale must have thanked God that Zemeckis hired someone else for this self-absorbed piece of tripe. The film resembles the films of the eighties that were trying to show female empowerment by having them think and act like men, that you watch now with a odd sense of embarrassment. That's what this film is to the disabled. It tries hard to seem so enlightened and yet most of the film's attitude is mocking. The way he just happens to become a football hero, because lets face it, in America if you're disabled then that's the only way to get acceptance from Bullies. Firstly why would someone want acceptance from Bullies and more importantly what the hell does that say about the world that this is the message Zemeckis is sending out.The film then becomes a horrible mish-mash as Tom Hanks is badly imposed in old film clips of chat shows and presidents, and the only plus of the film comes in the shape of a great performance by Gary Sinese that is spoilt by a cheesy ending where he forgives the Vietnamese by falling for a Vietnamese woman (Kind of like a really naff version of my name is earl.) If there is any justice in this world then this will fall down the list and out of the 250, but unfortunately the world is not just and if this film indicated that, then it would have a higher ranking from me.",4,7,15,18 February 2008
"Monsters, Inc."," What are we gonna do? Waltz right up to the factory?
","Monsters in the closet scaring kids within this world are not doing so out of any desire to do harm ...They are just doing their job. That is in this Pixar filum that introduced James P. Sullivan and Mike Wazowski to the world, two monsters whose job it is to scare kids, where their screams are processed and turned into clean dependable energy. That is until a little girl named Boo enters the world and changes how things are done forever.This film was beaten by Spirited Away at the Oscars but there is little to choose between them, especially as they focus on the story of a little girl whose journey takes her to a strange world inhabited by bizarre creatures.The voice work by Billy Crystal and John Goodman is superb, and as you'd expect from Pixar the story and script are first rate, the direction is top drawer and the animation a vast improvement on the work done on 'Toy Story 2'.This is an excellent film that's fun for the family, carries a good environmental message about renewable energy that will hopefully inspire the next generation that's coming along, is funny, charming and will make you laugh, cry and cheer as the antics of these big monsters keep your little monsters entertained for hours.",9,0,1,16 June 2008
Ant-Man," I've got a great idea ...Why don't we call the Avengers? Terrific Fun but not for MTV heads.
","The year is 1989 and Hank Pym is fighting a losing battle against his SHIELD employers over use of his revolutionary PYM Particle (That decreases the space between atoms allowing the wearer to shrink down.) In a fury he leaves and vows never to let his tech be used by anyone else. Skip forward to now and someone has managed to work out how to recreate his formula and it's not someone that should have that power, but thankfully, Hank knows of a guy who can help him, the former prisoner and hero of our tale, Scott Lang, the new Ant-Man.Now, realistically that is about all their is to this film. If you're expecting the big action spectacles of Ultron, Iron Man 3 and Winter Soldier then I will tell you now this film is not for you. This is a slow-burning origin film and as such is driven solely by the characters in the story, thankfully, these characters, like the great origin film THOR, are well worth our attention. The script is great and gives us plenty to enjoy and the effects of the shrinking are so well done that we barely think of them as effects (Always a good sign), the direction didn't detract and I never felt like it was lagging in any way and SPOILER ALERT when one of the characters was killed my 9 year old son was inconsolable END SPOILER ALERT. Overall I was very impressed with Ant-Man and would recommend this simple narrative over the cluttered AGE OF ULTRON. Yes, Ant-Man isn't setting up three future movies but its simple tale is done terrifically well and I recommend it as a great cinema outing for children 8 and above.Funny and Fun. A solid 8 out of 10.",8,2,11,31 July 2015
Watchmen," unbelievable!!! No really, It's awesome!!!
","The comedian is a crime fighting superhero of the mould of Batman or Green Arrow, a mere mortal with exceptional fighting abilities, he is also about to meet his match. As his door is beaten down he is assaulted by an attacker who seems to know and counter all of his best moves, and they are pretty sweet. However after a 30 storey journey straight down to the street level the comedian is no more. This is the catalyst that drives the barely human Rorshach into action to revisit the members of his old team and try and figure out if this marks the start of an attack on all his old team members from the defunct superhero team 'Watchmen'.Many films these days are over-hyped, dumbed-down or are turned into incomprehensible garbage, and while I heaped praise on 'Batman Begins' my feelings on the 'Dark Knight' are well known. Unlike Dark Knight, this hasn't been hyped to hell, nobody died before it came out so people's views aren't clouded by sympathy, and, unlike Dark Knight, I didn't really like the comic book. Yes, you heard right, I was not a fan of 'Watchmen'. Whilst the writing was okay (I preferred Moore's other works like 'Halo Jones') the artwork was quite static and I found that lack of dynamism off-putting (Gibbons women look like men in drag!) Add to the that the fact that the film had been branded 'Unfilmable' due to the size of the original text, and due to the persnickety nature of the audience, it was likely that the books fans would have a go at the film for being not enough like the graphic novel or too much like the graphic novel and you've got a tight rope it is virtually impossible for the director, Zack Snyder, to navigate successfully. So let's get to the guts of it. Is 'Watchmen' any good.If I was Alan Moore I'd start dancing in the street right about now. 'Watchmen' the movie takes the original ideas, too grounded in a desire to be real in the novel, and lets them take flight on the big screen. The action sequences are awesome, with a great blend of the realistic consequences of violence, which Moore wanted in the original text, mixed with dynamic cinematic editing and framing to make them exciting to watch. Much of the dialogue and the best cinematic shots are taken directly from the source, but look so much better on the big screen. It was like the ideas in the comic-book, belonged here all the time, but on the page, they were too restricted, (the dialogue sounding especially good from the mouths of these character actors.)Perhaps the masterstroke here though is with the no-star cast we have no baggage from previous roles, no 'oh, that's George Clooney as Rorsharch' or 'Russell Crowe as Nite Owl', etc. You accept the actors because nothing tells you that you are watching a movie, you are simply watching a huge story unfold before your eyes.I went to see this with a friend who nothing of the comic book and he loved it, I knew the original source but was not particularly a fan, and loved it. Obviously there are a few minor changes (In a way the big change is actually cleverer device than what happens in the original story!) but these were of the kind comparative to the subtle changes in Shawshank, nothing worth writing home about.Is it the greatest comic book adaptation of all time? I don't know, but it was a brave move by the studio and a ballsy piece of direction by Zack Snyder that has put this hype-played-down, superhuman-visual-treat in cinemas for the world to enjoy.I hope you do, as I know I will again.Joyous.Nuff said!",9,3,6,11 March 2009
The Bourne Identity," The Bourne Identity. A film in two parts
","A man is dragged on board a fishing boat unconscious, shot and in pretty bad shape, however, through luck or God, he winds up in a French hospital with no recollection of who he is, however, what he does know is that his name appears to be Jason Bourne, however, the more he starts digging the more names he finds, the more under threat he is, the more he is able to lash out at a moments notice, blocking his opponents with the perfect amount of force. This is a man who is literally a walking weapon. Eventually he stumbles upon the beautiful Marie, who decides to help him feeling that maybe their is something more to Bourne than meets the eye.The film is very VERY loosely based on the immense thriller by Robert Ludlum, and when I have been going through the reviews one thing stands out, and that is a large amount of people who rate the book do not rate the film and there are good reasons for this, for it isn't just about things that don't transfer well. There is great stuff in the Bourne Identity, key issues that relate directly to the title that are just ignored that make the rest of the film utterly pointless, the identity that he thinks he has is not necessarily what it actually is. In the book this is dealt with in a fantastic way that, if done correctly on film would have had the audience on the edge of their seat. Not touched on here.However, the other big problem with the film and one that I can't quite believe that no-0ne else has a problem with is that the climactic end when we supposedly find out what has happened and who Bourne is transpires that the despot that Bourne was sent to kill, he didn't because their was a kid there. So, this person we were routing for pussied out, and we're supposed yo like him? I didn't. This could be a Robert Mugabe type or a Pol Pot type of despot who would no doubt be grooming his children for future atrocities, how many other children were going to be killed because he had not carried out the assignment? This was not some shadow identity that was fiction this was supposedly the person that we were routing for? Or, to put it differently, if the only chance you had to go back in time and kill Hitler was whilst he was playing with some children at his lair in the mountains, would you do it? I think most of us know what the answer would be.The film itself is at its best when it is using or reflecting aspects of the book, which it does a lot of in the first half, and at its worse when it ignores them, as in the second half of the film. The car chase which other's have wrote is great is not the special and does not match the sequences in the superb 'Taxi' series of films, or even the more recent 'Vantage Point'. The main issue that people have with this film and I suspect the main reason why it scores so highly is that it seems edgy compared to a Bond who is usually super cool, BUT, simply the virtue of being different does not necessarily a good film make.For those who read and not just on a computer, get the book. It makes the film seem about as edgy as a rotting cucumber. Nuff said.",4,0,2,16 July 2008
The Thing," Now I know I'm still human ...Or am I?
","It's the antarctic, it's an American research centre and it's f**king cold outside. However, when a rival Norwegian research team turn up shooting at a dog, it looks like they've gone stir crazy and are put down for their own good. However as time progresses it becomes extremely apparent that they were very much in possession of their faculties and were not only fighting for their survival but for the survival of the human race.This is the start of John Carpenter's masterpiece (Rather then Halloween) and the film is made memorable for two things, first the effects, that never cease to amaze and dazzle the viewer in their complex and unending ability to shock, terrify and bemuse. Let's get something right that Spielberg recently had a bone with over the first three Indy films. matte paintings that look good are fine, CGI that looks like a play station game is not. The effects in this film are real, you know you're looking at something real and this makes for a film that is all the more unsettling.Next the acting and the script. In this film we feel the sweat and unpleasant camaraderie that people cooped up in this kind of environment feel. There are uneasy alliances and downright detestation of some people, they're not friends they're colleagues and it shares with Alien the distinction of putting these human relations in perfect transfer to the big screen. The script and acting make the effects real because you believe in how the people are with each other. Its ordinariness makes it real.For those of you who have not seen it watch past the first 30 minutes when you might think you're watching a kitchen sink drama in the Antarctic. Trust me, it's worth the wait.Nuff said Em",9,6,10,9 June 2008
Knowing," Knowing what I do now, I wish I hadn't bothered!
","John koestler and his son Caleb live alone, and when a time capsule is opened at his son's school with a load of random numbers written fifty years ago appears, it seems to be little more than a load of gobble-de-gook! However, after spotting a pattern within the numbers, John begins to investigate and finds a correlation between global disasters, their locations and death tolls and tries to prevent the next series of events.On entering the cinema to watch this I had high hopes. Alex Proyas was responsible for the excellent 'Dark City', and although the first half hour was hideously slow, once you witness these disasters (And believe me, you really feel like your witnessing these disasters) you are really drawn into the story, and as John sets out to prevent further disaster from looming the story picks up, the pace draws you in and you're really taken on for the ride. Personally I was loving it and really getting into it ...right up until the point were it ended, when the response 'What the hell' sprung to mind.The ending feels like a massive advert for Scientology and I almost expected to see the names John Travolta and Tom Cruise come up as executive producers. The ending of the film was such a let down as the children of earth, who know nothing of farming, agriculture or balanced diets are dumped on another world with little chance of supporting themselves, as the film progressively runs out of steam and comes crashing down with no way of redeeming itself, like the humanity in the film.It's a shame really as about twenty minutes before the end, it was progressing quite nicely. Shame they seem to have gotten stuck for an ending when the writing strike was in full swing.Nuff said.",6,2,5,4 May 2009
Wanted," A bunch of effects thrown together, do not a good action film make.
","So James McAvoy plays a bored office worker whose being chased by this killer and saved by Angelina Jolie's character to be hired by a group of assassins who maintain the balance of order in the world by a magic weaving machine (I kid you not!) they can make bullets bend and have the ability to perform superhuman feats but seemingly without super-human abilities and it is all a big excuse to use yet more matrixy effects bit without the reasoning, logic or sense.This film is a terrible indictment of some of the summer dross we have been getting over recent years, and sadly, because people don't know how to rate action movies they just heap praise on stuff without thinking of whether it is worthy of that praise, and this was one of those films.The matrix has rules and an ideology central to the story to mean that the effects are essential to the story, in too many films at the moment the story seems to be a reason to put certain effects scenes together and jeez they are poor. No emotional involvement did I ever feel for the characters, even when the magic weave machine gave out their names and put them in jeopardy. One of the things there should always be in any action film is a sense of danger and their never was here. It is just a collection of well constructed sequences with little emotional resonance in between.This is tedious fare indeed and it's sad that it's managed to get a rating this high when so much better films barely get over nine.Nuff said!",3,1,2,28 May 2009
Warrior," How to use and avoid clichés at the same time
","In a grim PIttsburgh town I feel like starting by saying Tommy used to work on the docks but he didn't, he's an ex-marine come home to try and get his life in order and maybe, try and patch things up with his abusive and recovering alcoholic estranged father, cut to Brandon, his brother who by contrast has a great life, seemingly, and a wonderful family. BUT, both of them have problems and the solution for both is to enter the same Mixed Martial Arts tournament for a five million dollar winner-takes-all prize where you kind of know exactly what's going to happen.And that is the film's curse and yet also it's strength because in a way you want it to go the way it's going to go and yet somehow when it happens it feels like such a shock. The script is packed with cliché's and yet because the film-makers do them right they never feel like it, and yet strangely enough the thing that isn't cliché feels more obvious than what could have been the clichés. The script and performances are top, some of the fights are brutal and yet others at times almost feel like they are not shot right, the story allows everything to get laid out in perfect clarity and yet it only takes up half of the film before they are at the tournament. Nick Nolte is top and Tom Hardy is his usual excellent self, although I have to say Kudos to Joel Edgerton for providing the emotional core of the film against such despair and desolation that alcoholism and domestic violence leave behind.A fight film that is ultimately about family more than anything else, that which we are born with, that which we create and those that which we choose to call family and it's that which will have you in tears at the end.A triumph.",8,0,3,2 July 2012
Duck Soup," He'll make his appearance when, the clock on the wall, strikes 10!
","Fredonia is a country in economic crisis going begging to Mrs Teadale to borrow money. Due to the disastrous way that the politicians are running things she states she will lend the small European country the money but only on condition that Rufus T Firefly is placed in charge. However once Rufus (Grougho) is placed in charge anarchy breaks out and the country winds up at war with its nearest neighbour Sylvania.This is the Marx Brothers finest contribution to screen comedy with Groucho on the form of his life with dialogue that is so sharp you suspect he may cut himself, he talks like he is afraid that if he stops speaking nothing may come out again, his performance is dynamic, fierce and fantastically bizarre. Chico plays his usual shifty fake Italian self and is as stupid as ever cracking a variety of puns that range from the atrocious to the 'I can't believe I am laughing at such a poor joke' level. Harpo is magnificent and his facial expressions and slapstick skills are great here. Zeppo, as ever, has little to do, but does it well. Margaret DuMont is superb as the straight man playing like this is the most serious drama ever and hamming up like her life depends on it. Leo McCarey's direction is great and the stand out moment that everyone remembers is the mirror sequence which is just superb and is worth getting the DVD for this alone. If you don't have this DVD get it. It should be in everyone;s comedy collection.Last thing of interest is the history of the film which I always thought was interesting in a world where life really does imitate art. Moustached dictator takes charge of European nation plunging it into war, an Italian turncoat changes sides when things go bad. Less than 10 years later Duck Soup played out for real as a tragic drama in the real Europe, which I always thought was an eerie coincidence.Now you have something new to think about.Continue.",9,2,3,21 July 2008
Disturbia," Not another Hitchcock rip-off! Oh, hang on? Hey! It's actually all right!
","Kale and his dad are fishing and having a good time. Their at an age when Kale's life is about to become his own. They are comfortable in each other's company and so are we. However, on the way back to town, they are involved in a car crash and Kale's father is killed. This tragedy plays on him and after getting into trouble at school one time to many and punching a teacher, Kale is giving a break of sorts, by avoiding Juvie and being placed under house arrest with an electronic tagging device. Obviously being an anxious, amorous teenager, this sucks for Kale till the gorgeous Ashley moves in next door. Things are looking up and nothing can change that. Except that Kale may be living next door to a killer, but is he, or is this all just his imagination?Thus begins the 'Rear Window' rip-off that should have been 'Disturbia'. But of course it isn't. Thanks to the cast, the script and the director, what we have in essence is a combination, in feel anyway, of the great John Cusack films of the eighties mixed with Hitchcock's eye for mood, imposed on the modern sensibility. You watch it and feel it shouldn't work, but thanks to Le Beouf's easy charm, and skilled abilities, honed from working years on children's TV, he carries the film in a way you would not expect to work, but it does. Sarah Roemer is easy eye candy for the young males in the audience and handles herself well enough, but aside from Le Beouf the other big star of the movie is David Morse, another old pro, pretty much like Le Beouf, who relishes the role he is given as the mysterious neighbour who keeps himself to himself but is there a reason why? The director does a dynamite job of controlling the pace and the music moves the mood splendidly without you really noticing its there. The only downside to the film, and it is a minor one, is that you are always aware of the Hitchcock comparisons. You just can't shake that feeling.That said don't let that minor niggle stop you from enjoying what is a great surprise package. I know I did! Nuff said.",8,0,2,30 January 2009
Rocky IV," The plot synopsis is empty ...Yep, it sure is!
","Although that said I'm sure that some smart Alec will go and fill the plot synopsis now, but prior to that, this was appropriate.This for me is the bigger weak link in the series than Rocky V as Rocky V is the first attempt for the Rocky series to get back on track and end the series with some self respect. If the series had ended with Rocky IV then the entire series would have ended in disgrace, like the road to films with Hong Kong and the Dirty Harry films with the Dead Pool.The film starts in a bizarre fashion with Rocky giving Pauly a giant robot that he somehow seems to reprogram to have a sexy woman's voice. Rocky starts out as his usual amiable self, before Apollo's death turns him into a mono-syllabic machine for the second half of the movie. Drago is a cliché of a character that has about as much realism as the city background of most studio newsrooms. 'If he dies, he dies!' When on earth has any boxer ever been like this. Any self respecting boxer knows the risks but would never wish that on anyone, and usually those that do kill in the ring lose their edge (Maybe that's why Rocky really won? Because Drago was pulling his punches? Hey there is some depth to the film after all?)The only upside to the film is that in spite of the ridiculous nature of the entire film and it's awful comparison with the first movie is that it is entertaining, in a really awful eighties way. It's like Rocky does 80's MTV.The only interesting thing about the film is that in the end when Rocky acts as a metaphor for world peace and it seems ridiculous, it is worth bearing in mind that it was only a couple of years later the soviet block collapsed.Coincidence?

Spider-Man," What do you want?! Shawshank 2!
","Because when I look at various comments on these pages regarding this film, and other blockbusters, I feel that this is what people want in every film they see and I don't know why. When I go to see a drama I see a drama, when I want to see a comedy I see a comedy, why does every film have to be 'The Godfather' otherwise it's badly acted and scripted? The only films that tend to buck this trend are superhero films that have character actors as their lead. The truth is that this is a really good blockbuster film. The story revolves around Peter Parker and his conversion from nerdy college kid to crime fighting superhero, at the same time as his nemesis, the evil Green Goblin, is spawned from his best friend's father Norman Osborn, and whilst Peter is Spider-Man, Norman's persona splits, tearing into the quiet and benign Norman, who eventually becomes the bullied victim of the controlling and evil Green Goblin.Like most good adaptations it stays pretty close to its source material and, in some areas, improves on them. The cast are are excellent in their respective roles with particular plaudits going to Willem Dafoe whose switches from Goblin to Norman are so perfect that you are never left in doubt who is who as his persona becomes more fractured. Cliff Robertson and JK Simmons are equally good as inspirational Uncle Ben and Uninspirational J. Jonah Jameson respectively.The action set pieces are all handled supremely well and even though some of the effects aren't brilliant, because of the overall strength of the film it matters little as the characters and story keep your interest so much that it doesn't matter if some of the effects aren't up to the standard of other blockbusters with less charm, plot and characters.A great start to the spider-man series. Shame 3 lets the side down.Nuff said Em",9,1,2,7 June 2008
Dark City," First their was the darkness, and then it got darker!
","The story of John Murdoch is a simple one that I'm sure we can all relate to. You wake up in a bath with no idea who you are only to find a dead woman in your apartment and find out that you are a twisted murderer ...Wait a minute? This isn't relate-able at all! This is the nightmare scenario the hero (Yes Hero!) finds himself in the beginning of the movie, chased by cops and god only knows what else as the world he inhabits seems to close in around him. Unable to decipher who he is and faced with terrifying half memories that don't even seem to relate to him, he spirals blindly through the world searching for answers that no-one has.There have been many comparisons to the Matrix with this film and while it is true that the matrix is a more polished film that this, there is still much here to be admired, from the realisation of the reality they inhabit to the fantastic claustrophobic set design. The direction gives nothing away until the big reveal which is just amazing. The cast are top drawer with a great turn from Keifer Sutherland and the beautiful Jennifer Connolly in the days she weighed more than 6 stone (mmmm!) but the real star is the Uber-impressive Rufus Sewell, who as the hopelessly confused Murdoch is absolutely magic, this is hands down the best film he has ever done.The effects in this film, while nothing special compared to the grand, eye-catching effects in the standard Hollywood fare we see these days, are used to great effect to create a chilling atmosphere where nothing is real and everything can be manipulated to be different in the blink of an eye.It is a shame that this film did not get the recognition it deserved but it's nice to see that IMDb members do tend to know a good film when they see one.Nuff said.Em.",8,1,3,12 June 2008
Spirited Away," You are really lucky. You get to watch Spirited Away on DVD
","And that from John Lassiter, head of Pixar, and big fan of Miyazaki.Chihiro is a young girl travelling in her parent's car as they try to get to their new home. She is annoyed and brattish as she sulks in the back of the car. As her father gets lost in woodland as he tries to find a shortcut, they stop in front of a Guardian statue standing watch over a tunnel, keeping others out as much as things in. Her parents ignoring her warnings walk through to a mysterious theme park which lies derelict. Without sounding dramatic, there is clearly something wrong with the area, but her parents decide to stick around, and once they smell the delicious food that was waiting for someone they decide to stay and eat As Chihiro explores the fairground wondering who used to come here she meets a mysterious stranger called Haku, who informs her that she has to leave and is in danger, she attempts to find her parents who have been turned into pigs and the stream she crossed on the way there has turned into an insurmountable river.Finding refuge in the bath-house, which is the only building she can seek safety she makes a deal with the House's owner Yubaba, to work there. As Yubaba steal's her name and she is put to work, thus begins the adventure of Chihiro where stink spirits and ghosts who gorge themselves while throwing about the promise of gold, make themselves comfy.It's not for me to argue with John Lassiter and I'm not going to. This film is an animation epic and may well be the last throw of the dice for 2D films, although as I type these words out I'm sure some other wise guy will prove me wrong. The film as a chronicle of Chihiro's adventure is a triumph of storytelling, the artist's skill and craftsmanship, the voice talent's invention and skill (Both Japanese and English) the clever use of symbolism as a comment on the state of Japan as it is now, the combination of which makes for a one-off in film that will and has already stood the test of time, as it's score on these boards is testament to.If IMDb voters are to believed, then this is the best animated film of all time.Believe it.",9,0,0,16 June 2008
Quantum of Solace," Daniel Craig owns Bond.
","So after the breakthrough movie that was 'Casino Royale', Bond is back in 'Quantum of Solace', and after a breakneck car chase to deliver Mr White, he is back in the thick of things, discovering the far reaching tentacles of the mysterious organisation that the Aforementioned Mr White (The villain from the end of the last movie) works for. After some more work, Bond discovers a slender lead in South America where he meets the beautiful Camille, a woman with her own problems and issues, and after another action set piece embarks on finding out more about the people that are after him and her, finding the link between the two, whilst trying to evade the CIA, his own compatriots and the bad guys as well.It is true that the film has no big villain, but, what is intimated at within this film is that it is coming. Daniel Craig, who has been unjustly criticised for his portrayal of Bond is a man at odds with his own people as well as his own beliefs and we see that inner turmoil surface at a number of points in the film, however, in this film we get more of a glimpse of Bond as a fully polished article, the way he moves seems slicker, more nimble and this is reflected in his physique which is more about definition than bulk; his expressions, delivery and every nuance of his performance are outstanding.Due to the writing also we get to see Bond in different lights, when he has to stay with a colleague who is not going to make it, he shows a compassion that we have never seen, because usually he arrives after they are dead and could do nothing, this time he has to deal with the fact that maybe, he could have done more, and we see a new side to him, that is refreshing.The other big strength to the film is the action which is handled with real aplomb by Marc Forster, which, with the exception of a few moments, allows you to see, feel and react to the pummelling Bond receives in this outing, add to that a score that, although lacks memorability of some previous Bond scores, accompanies the action terrificly.So, why is it getting slated? According to IMDb critics this film is no better than the sheer awful 'Wanted'. This is nonsense and like saying that 'Batman and Robin' is 0.1 less than 'Batman Begins', such is the complete lack of perspective. The film does have three major drawbacks, the first is the terrible theme tune that re-crops up in David Arnold's score bringing the mood of the piece down, rather than enhancing it like 'You know my name', the next downside is the fact that M always seems shocked when Bond kills people who are trying to kill him and not useful ...Duh! that's his job, and the final thing that the film misses that Casino has, is charm. Bond is charming in Casino and due to the story arc in this film he lacks the charm that he has in abundance in the last outing which is what reduces this score by three (See what I did)However this does not stop this being a cracking ride and a far better second outing which is alway a nightmare for any new Bond, so kudos to Craig, for sticking with it and proving that he was no lucky punk with the first film.007 out of 10.",7,2,4,6 November 2008
Batman Begins," Year One in glorious Technicolour!
","Bruce Wayne is lost. Seeking criminals to fight by getting locked up with them in south east Asia, he cuts a strong, skilled fighter but a sorry figure as his crusade for justice has turned sour and left him bitter and without direction. After being sought out by the league of shadows he is trained by the legendary fighter Ducard (Played by a Liam Neeson who does not seem like the same bored man who played Qui Gon Jinn) who adds the finishing touches to Bruce's skills showing him the arts of deception and the skills he needs to combat evil and to become an agent of Justice.However, after his relationship with the league of shadows sours, Bruce returns to Gotham, wiser, with an edge he did not have before. He teams up with a disenfranchised employee called Lucius Fox and raids Wayne Enterprises for the latest equipment in order to carry out his war on crime. After an hour of pre-amble and character set-up we are treated to some real Batman action and the movie never looks back as we watch the lost boy Bruce become the caped crusader, the dark knight that the comic books fans have been crying out for, for years. In this the best comic book adaptation ever made, we are treated to a tour-de-force of acting, direction, drama and, yes at times, even comedy, as we witness the birth of the Batman.The performance by Christian Bale is excellent, combining the driven, rage fuelled Wayne with the super-slick playboy returning to the city. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman add weight as the butler and the inside company man respectively. The direction is smart and subtle, turning Gotham from the all too dark visions of Tim Burton and clown like circus of Joel Schumaker into a real city, with dirt and rain and real people residing.Left open for sequels but with enough content to make a good film on its own this is the best Batman film so far and bodes well for the series from now on.",9,2,2,27 June 2008
Seabiscuit," One of the most under rated films of all time, because it's too amazing to be true
","Usually when the book of a film is made (A La Akiva Goldsman, 'A Beautiful Mind) the makers feel the need to Hollywoodise it and take out the more objectionable elements, for this film the real story of Seabiscuit is so amazing that they had to actually remove some of the elements that were too Hollywood, such is the story of this marvellous little race horse.Seabiscuit was a racehorse deemed too demanding by its original trainer and sold to Charles Howard, an automobile salesman. Howard hired Tom Smith, an unorthodox trainer who instinctively understood horses, who knew exactly what was required to get the best of Seabiscuit. Smith hired jockey Red Pollard to ride the biscuit and the combination of owner, rider and trainer would reap dividends, becoming a symbol of hope for America during the great depression, managing to beat all comers, with the the exception of the one horse that stood above the entire thoroughbred division, the mighty War Admiral.This film is another of Dave Ross' excellent under-rated body of work, with a cast giving great performances, most notably Chris Cooper as the quietly all-knowing Smith. The story is fascinating, as the three different human characters, all with their own tragedies and problems, are told with passion, conviction and honesty, a rarity in film-making. The story of the other main lead, the biscuit, is also done with real skill, with the training and races handled superbly, managing to convey both the excitement and the inherent dangers in being a jockey at the end of the great depression.This would have been considered a rank outsider for the best picture, had it contended in any other year when the 'The Return of the King' wasn't contending, but just because it didn't win, don't let that put you off investing an hour and a half in one of the best true stories of all time.PS.

In spite of all of these character flaws however their is something likable about him as all of this supposed brashness is merely a front for the loneliness he feels inside. On the last race of the season Lightning is involved in a three way tie with his two rivals and has to partake one final race in a weeks time to decide who wins the Piston Cup. However after his rig loses him on the way to the race and he winds up trashing the road in radiator spring he is forced repair the road over the week he is supposed to be travelling down to take part in his final race and on the way learns numerous life lessons.After the praise that was lavished on 'The Incredibles' it would have been easy for this to be an anti-climax, in fact when I first heard that it was a film about cars I thought Pixar had taken the easy option as when I was a kid I often played with cars and imbued them with personality so I though that Pixar were taking the easy option in a way, but nothing could be further from the truth. Unlike the animation in the Incredibles this animation has not dated at all and looks sumptuous and fluid in a way that the Incredibles animation hasn't. The story is a little clichÃ©, but it's handled with charm and panache by the usual Pixar team, with stellar voice performances from Larry the Cable Guy, Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt and John Ratzenburger, but the big steal in the film coming from the late great Paul Newman, who put in one of his great final performances in this film.While it's not been praised as much as Incredibles or Ratatouille, it is up there with Wall-E, Monsters Inc and Toy Story 2 for me.Yet another under-rated masterclass from Pixar.",8,0,0,24 May 2009

However, he returns with good news, he is hanging up his sword, the Green Destiny, up for good and seeking out the supposed simple life.

However, as Jen Yu, a young woman about to enter into an arranged marriage, is entering a period of emotional instability, it means that every character in this immense film is in more danger than they realise. In Ang Lee's colossal film these themes take on the power of Gods as every hidden emotion, every glance, every movement and every gesture takes on further meaning.The direction is amazing and the entire film is beautiful to behold, and having sen it at the pictures three times, believe me, I know. The costumes, the cinematography and props are fantastic and every craftsman who spent time on this film deserves an award for their efforts. The acting is first rate with all three leads being unbelievably awesome. usually at this stage I feel the need to single someone out, but I can't! They're all excellent and it makes for a film that is impossible to tear your eyes away from.That said it does take a few scenes to get used to the whole wire work stuff in there and I remember when I first saw it I thought 'What the hell is this?' But by the time I was half way in, I didn't care. The fight scenes of course are the things that give the film its action heart and they are incredible, with a number of multi-character fights that must have been tortuous to put together, but the best one being the one with the two women with the variety of weaponry that is so gripping and so violent as they really seem to go at t with hatred and vengeance so strong that they really seem to want to kill each other. This is no 'Charlie's Angels' bullsh*t fighting, this is the real deal.It was annoying at the time that the film was beaten at the Oscars to the best picture and Best Director nods by Gladiator and Traffic as both of these films, for me, have faded, while the things that make this film great, still make it great now, but I guess that's due to the fickle nature of the academy voters. However, it is pleasing that it's in the top 250, but sad that it's so far down.Sumptuous and Sublime!Em",9,1,2,6 July 2008
The Incredibles," Pretty good, a step on their journey to greatness
","Mister Incredible is a superhero at the top of his game, along with the likes of Frozone, Elastigirl and various others they keep people safe from various super villains. However, when Mister Incredible saves someone who does not want to be saved, it opens the floodgates for more superheroes to be sued by an ungrateful America that views them with envy, causing the government to ban superheroes and for their secret identities to become their only identities.In this, Brad Bird's inspired take on the superhero genre, we see what happens when Superheroes have to settle down and become ordinary people, the dialogue is excellent and the situations superb. The arrival of the supervillain Syndrome (I am your number one fan) with his secret base on a volcanic island being an element that is clearly borrowed heavily from the Bond films and the music reflects that. The performances are all great, with Jason Lee excelling as Syndrome, whose idea to dispose of all the supers and then make himself out to be a new superhero but for all the cleverness of it, one of the sad things about the film is that the best animated human at this stage of computer animation was still Boo from 'Monsters Inc' and some of the mixing of different size elements does not quite work as well as it should, with squash and stretch techniques also taking something away from pulling you in fully.The other thing about the film that lets it down is the editing, with clearly some scenes that could be tightened up for the sake of a quicker film that would have made for a better film. The ending also seems to keep on going and going and going when it could have been that much slicker.Overall a pretty good film.

","I had a sneaking feeling that when I went to see this film it was going to be one of those that was going to be a complete waste of time or a quiet masterpiece and thankfully it is the latter.After a quiet but intriguing start which the adults will probably enjoy more than the children, we are thrown into the deep end by watching the king of the magical kingdom offer a challenge to his potential heirs in order for them to become king, whilst the hero of the piece tries to bring a star back for the spoilt brat that he thinks he loves. After various scrapes we watch as the boy of the start becomes a man and realises what is important in life. Plaudits go to the gorgeous Michelle Pfeifer who has a great time in the best role she has had for years, but the scene stealing award goes to Robert De Niro who is simply amazing and I'm not a De Niro fan! But in this film he plays completely against type and is a revelation, which, for an actor of his years is no mean feat.Get it on DVD when it comes out. You deserve a treat",9,2,3,3 February 2008
I Am Legend," I am mediocre movie
","'Oh No, my dog has just ran into a building infected by weird vampire creatures and sh*t. You'd have thought that after three years here I would have taught him never to do that?' And there in lies the problem in this film, very few people seem to have thought much about it at all.'Hey I've got an idea, let's make Will Smith the last man on Earth, BUT, to kill any idea of dramatic tension let's make him immune from the virus that transformed everyone else!' Or ...perhaps a better idea, is not to, as that will kill any dramatic tension if he can't be that bothered by them. FFS! Who was the script doctor on this script? Akiva Goldsman? Wait no, just checked. He wrote this crap. Makes sense now, it's one of old clueless 'Hack' Goldsman lame efforts.Only gets two stars because it's not Batman and Robin.Yeuuuch!",2,3,3,3 June 2008
Transformers," A decent blockbuster that should gets unfairly criticised
","The film begins with a mysterious helicopter heading unceasingly towards a military base. It's pilot is warned what will happen if it keeps coming bit still it comes. Upon landing it lands at the base it 'Transforms' into one of the Decepticon and proceeds to destroy the military base, with little to no resistance from the troops who are ill-equipped to deal with such raw power, only one small team of soldiers make it out. Skip to high school dweeb Sam Witwicky's show and tell in which he reveals his grandfather was an explorer who went mad and started to ranting about a giant iceman, after getting an A for his presentation he is taken by his Dad to buy his first car, a yellow Camero. After witnessing his car driving off and later getting attacked by another vehicle, Sam discovers that the transforming robots that masquerade as cars are in a desperate quest to find the all-spark before Megatron the leader of the Decepticons.In the hands of another director this may have become just another toy advert but Michael Bay turns it into a tour-De-force as the Transformers are as real as anything in our world, their metal shining and reflecting exactly as it should creating an illusion that is almost perfect. By being extremely smart and using as much real world stuff as he could, it means that we know that what we are watching is not some stuff that looks like it came off of a Playstation 3 game like in Indy 4 but instead were watching something real unfold, even when we know it is not.The script does exactly the job it should of telling the story as well as it can with humour, passion, and yes even drama, as you genuinely worry about the robots as much as the humans, unlike so many other empty blockbusters that use over-hype to create a buzz and are rigged merely to sell merchandise, you always feel that in this film the story is the thing and if they do well with the merchandise, well that's a bonus. This is a big stepping stone in the right direction, if you want to sell more toys, make a better film! But for me the next thing of serious note are the actors, everyone of which takes everything they do seriously, which makes this film so believable. There are no dreadful looks to camera, no knowing nods to a post-modern world and even lines that you would think would fall on their ass like 'Gentlemen. I'd like to introduce you to my friend, Optimus Prime!' actually works, when you would think that they wouldn't. Shia Le Beouf (Apologies for spelling) is magnificent as Sam Witwicky and he performs every scene like his life depends on it. His performance is an assured one that will almost guarantee that he becomes a star, after all he has been doing this for years. The rest of the cast do a great job with Megan Fox having little to do other than look nice, but with Anthony Anderson doing particularly well as the comic relief (He is great at that).Films should always try and take us to places we may not have been and experience things we have never experienced, be it a perilous climb up the side of a building (safety last), a world of criminal corruption and secrets (LA Confidential), or a world of giant robots that are seeking an all-powerful cube.For those who think that this is a terrible blockbuster I would say watch GI Joe before you are so quick to criticise this cracker.",8,5,8,4 May 2011
Wimbledon," Casting problems that lead to a better film
","Originally intended for Hugh Grant, who I feel would be have been too old, they got Paul Bettany who was younger and in a great vein of form after 'Master and Commander' to pay the dashing, yet faltering, Peter Colt, who had watched his younger years go by without the triumph he so wanted. Now about to retire and settle down to a life of quiet obscurity teaching tennis to middle-aged women in an exclusive tennis club. However, wanting one last Hurrah, he decides to enter Wimbledon as a wild card, and after a pleasant encounter with Lizzie Bradbury in a shower (Lordy, Kirsten looks good naked) he starts to regain some of the form that he hasn't seen for some time.This is a surprisingly entertaining film that is notable for its two charming lead performances by Paul Bettany, who is great in the lead and plays the role of the dwindling tennis hopeful to perfection, and Kirsten Dunst as the up-and-coming tennis star with all her life before her. The script is far better than many would give it credit for with some really touching stuff about the ageing process, and both the cruelty and the joy of it, which for many people, will be something that they will be too young, or too old, to understand.The direction is handled ably by Richard Loncraine who manages to blend both the romance and the comedy with equal aplomb creating a delightful mix that works well. Good Sunday afternoon fare for anyone who understands what life is about and how to grab onto the good things while they are still there.",8,1,3,23 June 2008
Jerry Maguire," The key to this business is personal relationships.
","Jerry Maguire is a sports agent at the top of his game working for Sports Management International. They handle the lives of hundreds of athletes and negotiate the big bucks deals that get them everything they want. However, after a bad TV dinner in a hotel room, Jerry realises that this molly-coddling, not-telling-them-like-it approach, that the agents industry has put out their over such a long time might not be what's best for his clients, and decides to speak his mind with disastrous consequences. Armed with only one client who would stick with him, and the one assistant from his old firm who would stick by him, with the help of her ever-so-cute son, Jerry has to re-build his shattered life and reputation from scratch.The most apt description ever of this film is that it is a chick-flick for guys. Everything about this film screams chick flick, but because men folk are thick, because it has sports in it, we think it's for us. We're easily fooled! This for me was Tom Cruise's big breakthrough film, far from the confident, cocky, brash Tom Cruise we had seen before here was a different side, a human side, and it is his portrayal of Jerry, a man brought to his knees by an industry that doesn't care, that really sucks us in. You know that in spite of all the things that get thrown at him, he is a good person, and while he may have approached things the wrong way, his heart's in the right place, and it is inspired casting by Cameron Crowe and his team to get Tom in this role.The rest of the cast fill out their rolls superbly well, and Renee Zellwegger, Bonnie Hunt, Jay Mohr and Jonathan Lipnicki (Apologies for spelling folks) all are great in the rolls as assistant, assistant's sister, rival agent and assistant's son. However the big turn on the film other than Tom is Cuba Gooding Jnr as the under-rated Rod Tidwell, whose un-noticed form helps carry his team to greater things. So convincing is his portrayal, by the time you're midway through it you almost feel like your watching some fly on the wall documentary.The direction in this film is superb and this, along with 'Say Anything' are arguably his best work. The script is one of the best I've seen out on the big screen and itnever lets you settle in you seat. But in spite of all the ups and downs of Jerry and the motley crew that gather round him of course this is a feel good film, and if you're not humming 'Shelter from the storm' a few minutes after watching this film then you can show me the money.Nuff said.",8,4,6,2 February 2009
The Dark Knight," If this is as great as everyone tells me, why do so many people agree with my criticisms!
","Gotham is cleaning its act up, Batman is a successful crime fighting Legend, Jim Gordon is moving up the ranks and Harvey Dent is a tour-de-force for the city as its high flying District Attorney. Nothing can go wrong, can it? Well that it is except for a lunatic criminal called the Joker decides to bring chaos to Gotham, Batman is faced with a criminal who will stop at nothing to make a point and is seemingly always one step ahead of the Dark Knight, will he cross the line and kill to stop the madman and make Gotham safe, and will Bruce Wayne get to hang up his cape and get the happiness he deserves.After Batman Begins the scene was set for a bigger and better film to follow and after hearing all the hype I felt that this film could not fail ...I was very wrong. There are a number of issues that I had with the film that I have yet to hear a good defence for. The great films may not be liked by everyone for bizarre reasons but their criticisms are usually swept aside by the faithful. There are far too many errors in this film for it to pass such tests. I will address them one at a time, as one by one these spoilt the film for me.The first is that the film drags and drags and drags. Around the time of Batman's big decision of who he gets to save seems to be the perfect time to end it, on an Empire style ending, instead it goes on and on and we have about thirty to forty minutes extra to wrap everything up that the film simply doesn't need. End it with suspense, leave me on a high, but if I'm looking at my watch you've failed.Two, the performance of Heath Ledger is not all that. Yes, he is dead and this is sad, but the Joker we get in this film is sadly not the Joker of 'The Killing Joke' or the Joker of 'The Dark Knight', sadly it is somewhere in-between and this version is very mish-mashy, added to that the make-up changes from scene to scene when the jokers skin is supposed to be white all the time, also the make-up should make him look like he's smiling, DO YOU GET IT WRITERS, HE IS CALLED THE JOKER. Did he laugh that often in the film, I think not, he hardly smiled at all either, what's that for? For me, the big star turn in the film is by Aaron Eckhart who is magnificent as Harvey Dent and seems to steal every scene that he is in. Eckhart cranks the film up and makes it his own, and this is what increases the rating as it does.The action sequences that are so gripping in the first film are sadly lacking here as the editing to make it a lower rating and get more bums on seats have cut the films strongest feature to shreds.The last thing that really trashes the film for me is the end sequence with the Joker's final trap, as there is little explanation of how he has done this, are we expected to believe that the Joker is magic as that is what it feels like the director is saying. I'm all for big surprises but this was just too unbelievable, and I'm saying that about a film that has a man dressing up as a giant bat! Many of the people I have spoken to claim to love the film yet so few have any defence of the errors I speak of here, many of them Jump in and agree, and sometimes even add to the list, which annoys me for two reasons, because it will mean that more rubbish will get churned out that is supposed to be good and also because people's standards by accepting sub-standard films as good are lowering and we should always, as viewers, expect more, and pace, performance, writing and even make-up should all be first rate when $170 million dollars have been spent. Maybe many people feel that because there is so much hype for a film, and so much critical acclaim that they must be wrong for not liking it, when the truth is that the people who don't like it all that much are the ones who are right and those that just suck up to the critics view are very wrong. Thankfully I have been here before and faced exactly the same backlash 14 years ago for saying I didn't enjoy 'Jurassic Park' which had similar levels of hype and got similar levels of public favour at the time of release. I find it interesting that it is now so very far down the rankings as, upon release, it was supposed to be the best film ever, according to the critics.No film could get a reaction like this on these boards without some element of over-reaction, and in this case it's to Ledger's death, the best time to judge this film will be in a year's time when the hype has died down, and for those who can admit they made a mistake to rethink their over-hyped ratings. Disappointing.",4,14,27,10 September 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Of summer 2007's offerings, one of the most satisfying
","Let's start with the negatives first. This film is part of a set now that follow on one after another so if you did take it rating as a sole piece of work, my score would probably be lower ...However, to quote Spock in Star Trek VI, 'All things are not equal!' Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was, by all accounts, many people's favourite book was an appalling film made almost unwatchable by Mike Newell's heavy handed direction. The follow-up to Goblet, Phoenix, was by comparison the worst of the Potter books as it seemed to feature a 500 page rant by JK Rowling against Corporal punishment that could have sufficiently been crammed into 200. The challenge for David Yates was to turn this convoluted mess into something vaguely enjoyable.To say he did a good job of this is an understatement. The missing ingredient from the fourth instalment that was joyously back in this film was Harry, Ron and Hermione's on-screen chemistry. The scenes with all the pupils enjoying the ensuing adventure even in such difficult circumstances made what could have been an ordeal into the rich tapestry of wizardry that the fourth film should have been.There are many highlights but it is in the detail that this film excel's. Jinny's look's of spiteful longing, Mad-eye's magnificent posture when he apparates and the, pardon the pun, spell-binding battle between White and Dark wizards.Good performances of note? Too many to mention, but Gary Oldman steals the limelight again and Luny Love god was great for an unknown.In short, when watching back in a few years time watch 1,2,3, skip 4 and watch 5.Much Love",8,0,0,15 July 2007
Annie Hall," The best written comedy of all time
","The film starts with Woody talking to camera (This should fail but doesn't) about going through a mid-life crisis while reflecting on his break up with Annie (in the title). We see his early life living in a house under a roller coaster and a number of comedic moments here set the tone for the rest of the movie. We move on to see the latter stages of his romance with Annie as they get to the point where they can no longer stand each other and together through the ease of the relationship, rather than endure the struggle to find someone new. This should be pretty depressing fodder, but due to Alvy's mixed up nature and his knowledge that he is messed up but trying leads you to liking him when really, you shouldn't. Add to that a superb early appearance from Christopher Walken (who almost nicks the scene from Woody and sets the tone for every character he'd play from this point on) and every single director's trick in the book and this leads to the best written romantic comedy ever put to page that has yet to be bettered. Whilst Manhattan is regarded as Woody Allen's love letter to New York, for me, this is his love letter to life itself. Free of some of the over-referenced, literate attempts at later movies, this is a film free of form that achieves effortless brilliance, and yet from details of the making of the film, you know it was anything but. The lines and situations are brilliant from the moment that Alvy Singer delivers his dialogue about his feelings on life, and his views on women, following swiftly with the details of his early life, including his first realisations that life will end, cut to the chase 30 years later and he is still worrying, but in spite of the worry and the despair you never feel depressed and even the bitter sweet ending (How many film-makers would try that today ...Apart for Kevin Smith?) feels wonderfully satisfying.To say this is the best comedy ever written is perhaps overdoing it. However it is the best written comedy of all time...Forgive the grammar",9,0,0,19 January 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," One of the most romantic films of all time
","Joel is a social inept who is unsuccessful in relationships, watching his life go by and unable to really do anything about it and being powerless to change anything, until a trip to Montauk changes everything, he meets Clementine, a scatty spontaneous and bizarre woman, and everything changes. He clicks with her on the train and you instantly feel a connection between them, you enjoy watching them, and you remember yourself the joy of these moments and how good they feel, the warmth, the affection, the sensation of a touch as you brush aside a hair, savouring a look, the delicious image of a loved one sleeping, things that stay with you, that will never leave you, no matter what happens.Skip forward to the break-up and Joel distraught in the car in pieces as it has all gone wrong for him, but at least he and Clementine have their memories, right? Wrong! In Charlie Kauffman's perfectly scripted masterpiece, people who want rid of painful memories can have them removed at Lacuna Inc, a memory erasing centre where anything can be removed, at a price. As Joel decides to exact a kind of subconscious revenge on Clementine he decides to have her removed, and as he visits the end of the relationship, we can see why. It was dead and going nowhere, so what's the point of keeping it? However as he goes back and experiences some amazing moments with Clementine we realise and remember with him, the best moments in a relationship and what they are about and how losing those is something we shouldn't do, because they are as important, in fact more so, than the bad moments that end it.In this film it explores this theme with a flawless execution, the pain he feels is not because his relationship is over, it is that the best of it cannot be added to, and how we all ultimately lose sight of what is important in relationships in today's quick fix society. That spark that starts them when they are new may die, but some of the things that replace them are more beautiful and more worthwhile. As Joel tries to fight off the memory erasers he hides in different memories and we see bizarre mixtures of different stages of his life, and the film becomes a dazzling series of clever twists and turns as he fights them in his sleep, while outside his head other battles are ongoing with the very people that are trying to erase him.The script on this film is just a joy to comprehend and the more I think about it the more in awe I am of Kauffman's handling of the subject matter. Carrey is brilliant as the put upon Joel and we don't regard him as a clown, but as a genuine, gentle, sympathetic soul who is captivated by the effervescent Clementine, played with energy and verve by the usually good value Winslet. The supporting cast headed by Kirsten Dunst, the brilliant Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are all great, but this is Carrey and Winslet's film and they shine ferociously in this joy to behold.Largely overlooked by the Oscars and splitting reviewers like a lumberjack splitting redwoods from their roots, this is gonna become one of those films that will either dazzle of drizzle, depending on who you are and where you come from, but for me, this is well worthy of its place in the top 250 and will hold strong as long as people see movies.",9,0,3,23 June 2008
Avatar," predictably spectacular...spectacularly predictable
","Jake Sully is dispatched to the planet Pandora, he is a disabled marine who luckily is his brother's twin, so he can take part in Avatar program. A program were human's take on grown bodies, part human, part N'aavi (The natives of Pandora) in an effort to interact with and convince the natives it's okay to plunder the planet. As a marine Jake is wooed, coerced, by Major bad-guy to sell out the N'aavi so the humans can do what they want but things don't go quite to plan as the Avatar world becomes more real than the real one.Apparently James Cameron spent years and years on the technology to bring Avatar to life, but a little less time on the script (Unobtanium? Come on, why not call it hard-to-get-at-ite or virtually-none-of-ix) and after the first fifteen minutes you kind of get sign posted to how the movie will go, after all Hollywood doesn't spend $300 million dollars on a movie that's not predictable, right? So, yes, it's predictable, yes the scripts got holes in it ...BUT, the million dollar question is, is it any good. Well, in spite of these things, yes it is.It is corny as hell and some of the effects, most notably when Jake is first running about in his Avatar body, aren't brilliant for a film that's had this much spent on it. Also some of the big gun-ships don't look like they would be physically able to fly and these are some of the minor niggles that almost pulled me out of the movie.That said it is fantastic fun, James Cameron has attempted to carve out of the sci-fi niche, in terms of scale, a film on a level with Frank Herbert's Duen, and although he is no Frank Herbert in terms of writing, as a film-maker he is a master of his craft and you do get taken into this world. Sat there you feel for the N'aavi, and you do feel some remorse for the past sins of generations who wiped out the Native Americans and have seen the Aborigini's also decline. If the film was not successful we would not feel this, it is testament to him that we do.Where will it all end. Well, more studios will pump money into predictable 3D blockbusters and will see them fail because they don't get that you need more than a few life lessons, big CGI and dots on people's motion capture faces to make a good film, but that takes nothing away from this. It is great fun. It should be seen at the pictures and like the title says, it is predicable, but spectacular!",8,1,4,4 March 2010
Toy Story 2," The best sequel of all time
","If you discount 'Empire' as part of a sequel, and unlike many of the people who address the board I always feel that the Godfather part II feels like a rehash of the first with the similar ending. The first 'Toy Story' was a film that pushed the boundaries of what computer animation could do, but it feels like a tester, like the first. It doesn't go to places with the script and characters the way that this one does. There are moments in this film that move and pull on the heartstrings in the same way that the Disney master-classes of the past such as 'Snow White' and 'Dumbo', especially with such intricately marvellous moments such as the cleaning of Woody and Jessie's song that even now manages to wring a tear out of me.This movie starts where the last one left off with Buzz and Woody being the best of friends, however after an accident whilst being played with, Woody's arm is ripped and he is left on the shelf. After coming to terms with the fact that he may be binned Woody, through a natural series of events, discovers who he is and the fact that a child of Andy's age having a toy like Woody all becomes clear.The voice work of Hanks and Allen is as good as ever, but with Kelsey Grammar and a hyper Joan Cusack (YEEE-HAAA!) added the cast improves no end. The animation in this film has also improved, and even though it is not of the standard of Monsters Inc or the Incredibles, it's still very passable. This film feels like what I wanted out of Toy Story and didn't get. Buzz is more likable, Woody's fantastic and the message within the film of the true value of loyalty and friendship, with the sad part being that the price we pay for these things is eventually loss.If the first film was a test of what the animators could do, then this is a test of what the writers and directors can do with the new toy of computer animation.Results of the test...Straight A.",9,0,1,24 February 2008
There's Something About Mary," There's something about movie makers that are out to impress!
","Ted is recounting the story of his first and only true love Mary. After defending her handicapped brother Mary starts to get to know the goofy Ted and begins to like him, even inviting him to the prom. However, after going to her house and getting his genitals caught in his zip the evening goes from bad to worse with Ted spending the night in hospital and missing the prom.After years of failed relationships Ted reminisces about Mary with his best friend who advises him to seek her out through a private detective friend of his (Played deliciously by Matt Dillon!) who also falls for Mary along with every other man in the film, thus begins this comedy of errors that made both Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz a star and put Matt Dillon back on the map, and also, to some degree, began the rebirth of American comedy.This film has largely been forgotten in moviegoers minds by more recent films such as 'American Pie' '40 year old virgin' and 'Knocked up', but this is the film that started that flurry in that it shocked people with how far it could go. The sight gags are side-splittingly funny and the physical comedy throughout is hilarious, from Matt Dillon playing ball to the legendary dog fight, it's all good. The script is great and allows all the characters to shine, but as always with films like this it's the chemistry between the leads that's the key and Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz come together with such charm and ease that it carries you along.As with a number of other examples over time,such as 'Rocky', 'Airplane' and 'Pulp Fiction', it is clear that the Farrelly brothers had a very clear indication of what they wanted to do with comedy and put a lot of themselves in there and it shows. Their passion for their craft has never been more in evidence.In an age when so many films get to the top of the box office by hype and advertising. It clawed it's way to the top because people saw it and saw it again and the reason they did that is because it is that good.True the crude humour won't be to everyone's taste, but if you've got the stomach for some belly laughs and a small amount of smut, then you can't go far wrong here.Megatron!",9,3,5,7 July 2008
How to Train Your Dragon," Dreamworks hit and miss animation output continues with a ...massive hit!
","Hiccup is a young viking unlike any previous portrayal of a viking, being weak, scrawny, intelligent and strategic rather than all brains and muscle. In his village however this is unappreciated as what they need are strong, beefy men to fend off the nightly attack of the local dragons. However during the last attack Hiccup believes he has killed the most dangerous dragon of all, the mysterious night-fury, and upon searching the forest, Hiccup does indeed find the downed beast. Although he knows he should kill the dragon which is what he is trained to do, Hiccup releases the beast, and over time, due to circumstances I won't go into here an unlikely bond develops between man and dragon. Hiccup eventually uses this knowledge to overcome other Dragons as his father (Stoic) enrols him into Dragon killing class, but will the knowledge be enough to finally gain his father's respect and save his village? Dreamworks animation has over the years provided us with much in the way of animated comedies and it is an area they usually excel in, from Shrek to Madagascar and the most recent of comedic hits, Kung Fu Panda, the studio shines in their ability to tap into today's post- modern thinking, but the two things their films may have lacked before now is, perhaps, a genuine sense of fear for the characters, something that the best Pixar films always have, and ...heart; the ability to tap into that part of us that puts us firmly into the characters plight on screen.This is the first Dreamworks film that succeeds were others have failed. It is always a good sign when a films box office performance increases due to extremely positive word of mouth. The only other film I can think of that has done this is the Farrelly's 'There's something about Mary'. The story of Hiccup and toothless is charming, scary in parts, but very endearing and the animation is not as overtly stylized and, well, not quite as good as Pixar-esquire, as previous outings have been. The voice work is very good by the four leads, Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson and America Ferreira, and the main threat, when it is ultimately revealed, is one that is genuinely frightening. There are few things better in cinema than that feeling of 'How the hell is the hero gonna beat that?' The direction and writing are decent enough but this is one of those films were the sum of the parts are actually far more than the the individual pieces combined. But perhaps the best thing about this film is, well without giving anything away, it's the fact that we don't get a complete pat happy ending. The final reveal of the horror of war and battle is almost unbelievable in a family film and I was completely shocked that a major studio had the guts to do something like this in a big budget movie and we should all doff are hats to them for such a bold move.Congratulations Deamworks animation. You've come of age.",9,2,3,1 January 2011
Rocky," Where's your hat? Timeless classic with immortal themes
","The music starts and the scrawling black and white lettering moves across the screen. The fanfare is a triumphalist sound that will clearly lead into an epic story. So to go from that to a dingy fight club in Philly is a strange twist. The boxing on display in the ring is far from pedigree as two ten-a-penny brawlers slug it out in the ring, one clearly moving away from anything resembling a prime. The fans don't like it and jeer, and as the fighter leading decides to crank it up a notch he backs the loser on the ropes and head butts him. The violent assault sparks him into action and he drives his opponent back and wins by a knockout. The money earned is minuscule and there is little reward for the effort and pain endured.Thus begins the story of Rocky, a man who truly is a bum from the neighbourhood. As the film goes on we learn more about him, he is a collector for a loan shark, a hired goon paid to break people's fingers if they don't cough up what they owe. This should make us dislike him more, but it doesn't, because like the very people he is collecting from he is on the bottom rung of society's ladder. A man for whom breaks of anything but the physical type are exceedingly rare.Cut to a man at the top rung, a man for whom things don't go wrong and for whom setbacks are a major inconvenience for his perfect world. Apollo Creed, heavyweight champion of the world, being informed that his snow white underdog cannot fight due to a broken hand, with no other fighters willing to go head to head with him he seeks a novelty, and plumps for the idea of fighting a nobody, a club fighter, a ham and egger for the million to one shot prize of the heavyweight title on offer, and in spite of protestations from his trainer he picks Rocky Balboa.And so we have what is probably the greatest fictional underdog story of all time (True-life underdog film is 'Seabiscuit'). In spite of the sequels that came after this is a low budget, Indy style movie and when you watch it, should be judged as such. The performances from Stallone, Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire, Burt Young and the irrepressible Carl Weathers are flawless, just check out Stallone's face when being informed he is 'A tomata!' and his realisation, in the key scene of the movie while he stands alone in the ring, of the enormity of his situation the night before the fight. This is acting where anymore would be too much and any less would too little. Stallone nails the scene.The script is a brilliant study of the underbelly of society and how it reacts to such incredible moments of life and the direction is excellent by John G. Avildsen, but the second star of the film, other than the actors, is the unbelievably brilliant score by Bill Conti, whose trumpets, strings and vocal arrangements are unforgettable after the first time you've heard it.There are good and bad sequels to this film, some of which have been documented within my own reviews, but this is the first, it's raw power is not diminished and the ending is still one that I never tire of seeing, even to this day.Nuff said Em.",9,0,0,14 June 2008

","Two people chat in a diner about their previous life of crime and the fact that robbing convenience stores is extremely dangerous, with more and more owners getting wise and arming up, however, punters in restaurant very often have more money and put up less of a fight. The language is coarse and quite off putting and when the credits kick in this continues with music that is an affront to the senses, unsettling them with huge brass sections that curdle the ears and batter the senses.Cut to, Vincent and Jules, two hired goons sent to receive an object from a bunch of kids who are clearly dealing with people that they are out of their depth with. What follows is one of the most amazing and memorable film moments of the last 20 years as Samuel L Jackson gives his famous eulogy from the biblical passage Ezekial 25:19. From this point on we are exposed to the crime underbelly of America, an area which wants to do all it can to make money, an area immune from the law where people can do what they want without worry of prosecution or the law, Bruce Willis plays Butch, a boxer who the Crime Lord, Marcellus Wallace, is attempting to buy. After a brief encounter with Vincent Vega at the bar, what then begins in earnest are three very different stories The first story is Vincent and Mia's, where Vincent is asked to take Marcellus' wife out for the night while he is away. What follows is a night out that represents both the best and worst night out you could possibly ask for This is followed by the story of the Gold Watch and is Butch's tale about what happens in the fight and the immediate aftermath for all parties. This is arguably the funniest of the three stories, but that does not take away from the fact that it is still horrific.The last story is the story of Jules and if the highlight of the film with one of the greatest scripted moments of all time as Jules explains to Ringo, clearly and concisely about who he is, what he is and what the world is all about, it is chilling, it is amazing, it is breath taking, and I remember leaving the cinema with a feeling that I'd not had since 'The Empire Strikes Back' like someone experiencing cinema for the first time, which I guess the best cinema does.The writing here is superb and had a profound effect on cinema with a lot of Tarentino style knock-offs coming after, but none quite matched this. The Direction is inventive and savage and as I mentioned previously seems to batter the senses, and yet the climactic ending is perfect in its subtle portrayal of a man who clearly understands his place in the world and is struggling to get out of it.John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis are all fantastic, but Sam Jackson as Jules is simply perfect and to watch him as Jules experience something that logic clearly cannot explain and what it means to him, is something that is, well truly profound, and, as with a lot of Tarentino films, there is a very moral message lurking within the core of evil that seems to suffocate everything and everyone in the film. People complain that certain elements are homophobic, but their are gay criminals as well as straight and the way I see it is that we shouldn't be afraid to show both, after all, no-one complains about straight people being portrayed as criminals.This is a great film that I believe will last the test of time, its performances are brilliant, although it is worth the time of watching just for Sam Jackson's performance alone and while Jackie Brown's subtlety make it a more enjoyable watch, this will be the film for which Tarentino will always be remembered, even though his star may fade over time.",9,0,3,24 June 2008
Rocky III," Arguably the second best Rocky film
","You know, when I was a kid growing up this was actually my favourite Rocky film. Now as time's gone by and I'm older and wiser, it is of course the original which stands apart from the others. The symbolism and meaning that old all the plaudits are in the first film, but this one is still my next favourite. This film has Rocky as a successful heavyweight champ whose world comes crashing down when he finds out that his subsequent title defences weren't what he thought they were. Faced with a viscous challenger Rocky has to come to terms with facing his own fear of losing everything he's worked hard to build and remember exactly what it was that made him everyone's favourite underdog.True it is not in the league of dramatic brilliance of the first film and it is corny as hell, but that takes nothing away from one simple truth and that is that this film is fun. From the moment of the opening montage or Rocky's successful title defences through to the end painting of Apollo and Rock in the ring it's a rip-roaring enjoyable punch fest and the truth is that there's nothing wrong with that. I, like a lot of people thought little of this film due to Rocky 4 and 5, but what I would say is treat this as it should be treated, as the third part of the first Rocky Trilogy.Fantastic!",8,0,0,30 December 2007
Thor," Like Iron Man, think big, for Heroes, think small for story.
","In the beginning ...ish, Odin and his people overthrew the frost giants and their attempted occupation of Earth and came to a sort of peace between the different galactic realms. As a king he overseas this peace, as a father, he attempts to instill a sense of wisdom in his two sons, Loki and Thor. However, when their realm is broken into by the Frost giants Thor's attempt at retribution is ill-thought out and Odin is forced to act, stripping Thor of his status as heir and banishing him to Earth, after which, medium-sized hell breaks loose. Can Thor regain his place as Heir of Asgard and be worthy again to wield his mighty hammer, which I have thus far forgot to mention? Many of the film critics that have thus far reviewed Thor seem to regard him as an also-ran in the Marvel catalogue of heroes, not knowing perhaps that Thor was one of the company's biggest heroes, however, bringing a Norse God into a sense of modern reality was always going to be tricky, and it would have been easy to have a giant-sized 'Masters of the Universe' style mess. However, like Iron Man (The first one, not the disastrous 2nd instalment) it makes its heroes big, larger than life figures, while making their predicaments very human ones, a search for knowledge, a desire for a parent's approval, the folly of youth and the vulnerability of age, ground the story and allow us, as viewers a way into this tale.Kenneth Branagh, while not an obvious first choice for a big budget blockbuster does a decent job of tying all the different elements together, the script is decent and the cast do a good job, with particular praise to both Chris Hemsworth as the brash Thor but also Tom Hiddleston who was very good as the complex and unreadable Loki, who added real depth to what could have been just a, well, a cartoon super-villain really. Enjoyable for young kids who will like the 3D stuff and all the action and okay for their parents who were raised on this stuff. The only major drawback, if you can call it that, is that unlike previous next movie tie-ins after the end credits of recent Marvel films, the one at the end of this one was a bit disappointing. But still. Enjoyable, but not as great as previous Marvel outings.",7,4,9,2 May 2011
It's a Wonderful Life," The Greatest Christmas film of all time
","The first time I became aware of this film I must have been in my teens and it was referenced in the sitcom 'Cheers' with the normal cast mocking the film's sentimentality at the end and then uniformly bursting into tears. I guess when you think about it, that's what this film does better than anything else. It takes our jaded world weary selves and reminds us that their are better things in life than money and success.I know I won't be the only person to say that the casting of Jimmy Stewart as the perfect George Bailley maybe the most fortuitous part of casting ever, and they may well be right. He is perfect as both heroic boy to disillusioned man that has ever been portrayed on screen, and he plays these myriad of emotions with the same intensity and passion that he plays every scene in the film. The scene in the bar where he is praying for help is one of the most heartfelt moments I have ever seen in film. As you watch it you are drawn into his plight as you know that his life and soul are on the line.The script is dynamite and like most of the best films has had scenes stolen and reworked and spoofed a thousand times over (Hell one of the best Simpson's episodes is the Leftorium for Chrissake and that's the Simpsons!) If you had to pick a downside it would be the stereotypical black woman who seems to have walked off the set of the Tom and Jerry cartoons and straight onto the screen here, but that aside, it doesn't stop this your enjoyment and as long as people watch movies it probably never well.M",9,1,3,28 January 2008
Die Hard," The only action film to spawn an incorrect mathematical formula
","John McClane is a New York cop going through a messy separation with his successful business woman wife whose climb up the corporate ladder has meant she has had to move to LA with their children. Embittered but trying to patch things up officer McClane heads to see her at her company's annual Christmas bash. However a group of terrorists crash the party with a new agenda and John McClane undertakes a lone fight inside and out of the building as both the terrorists and the Cops seem determined to kill him.This is another one in a series of films I have critiqued that shares a distinction of being one of the best films of the eighties. The characters in this movie are well fleshed out and you believe in the depictions of all of them. John as the world-weary, Bogart-esquire cop with a great line in pithy comebacks, but also great utterly cheesed off dialogue as well, Bonnie Bedalia as the wife in question has little to do but does it well, however in this movie it is Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber who is most memorable in creating a performance of a chilling bad guy, motivated solely by greed and with a plan so fiendish that you just don't spot the twist coming.The action sequence and the tension cranked up by John McTiernan's superb direction is magnificent and you never feel settled as you watch, always nervously worried whether McClane is gonna make it out of there in one piece and the key scene with the glass is one of the most cringe making in movie history. The use of music, in particular Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is also terrific as it is used as both a rousing piece as undercurrent for certain scenes and joyous celebrations for others.However, one of the most interesting things about this movie is the way that it has spawned a falsely assessed movie formula. For most lazy critics they seem to think that a hero against the odds equals 'Die Hard on ...something' e.g 'Under Siege' equals 'Die Hard on a boat', 'Speed' equals 'Die Hard on a Bus' and also 'Executive Decision' equals 'Die Hard on a plane'. All of these assessments however are incorrect as they forget the key thing that makes Die Hard the one off that it is, and that is that in all these films just mentioned the authorities are on the side of the hero, whereas the thing that makes 'Die Hard' so tense is that McClane could just as easy get killed by the cops as by the bad guys as they both hate him. In that building, he has few allies and no-one else to turn to. This tension makes 'Die Hard' the unique film that it is.Best action film of all time? I think Raiders probably takes that, but it's certainly a photo finish.",9,1,1,17 August 2008
When Harry Met Sally...," There are three things to remember in relationships
","1) Men are always idiots before they hit thirty (And usually after) 2) Most men have no taste and 3) and the one that never gets mentioned is that even when women are wrong they will never admit to it.And for me this is the key thing that separates this movie from others as I have seen countless romantic comedies where the bloke makes mistakes and gets things wrong, but there very few movies where the female lead is as flawed and f***ed up as the man (Only 2 spring to mind).This is the story of Harry and Sally, two people who meet on the journey to a new life in New york. In the road trip there we learn 2 things, 1) Harry is a jerk and 2) Sally has still not been opened up sexually. These are clear from the conversations that take place, and the two leads play these roles to perfection.We leap frog 5 years and then another 5 years to see both characters coming to the end of long-term relationships and both suffering in different ways, Harry by seeking refuge in one night stands and Sally by being in denial, however as their friendship blossoms they both start to begin the healing process and as the movie moves further through their lives to it's inevitable conclusion we find out a hell of a lot about relationships and life in general as we go through one of the most enjoyable 90 minutes that the movies have produced over the last 20 years.The two leads are played with charm, vulnerability and honesty by Crystal and Ryan as the discuss anything and everything, from young girl's lack of understanding of 'Casablanca' to the difference between women's and men's sex dreams. Whilst Nora Ephron's script is superb, what marks this out from later efforts are 2 things. Billy Crystal's superb comic skill, which can take something that's nothing and make it fantastic, and the direction of Rob Reiner, which avoids some of the later Ephron efforts of being too over the top or over-long due to her desire, like most writers, to get every word from the page onto the screen, which often doesn't work.This is one of the best films of the eighties, but like many great films of this era 'Tootsie', 'Bill and Ted' and 'Ghostbusters' it is regarded as being, well, not as good as it is due to being made in the eighties.Fashion changes, class remains and this is classNuff said.Em.",8,1,1,21 June 2008
Wedding Crashers," Why do Muppet's come on the boards to complain
","If you've got something to say constructive or otherwise, say your comment, make your peace and get out! Like many people I think this is a funny film and well worth a view, and I'll get to why in a minute.Firstly, let's take the basics. This film is kind of like a remake of four weddings and a funeral, it's American name might be several weddings and a funeral or two weddings and a funeral, depending on your point of view. The story centres around 2 professional men in their early thirties who crash weddings in order to sleep with women who want to hook up with a potential partner at a friend or relatives wedding, and while Vince Vaughn's character is living for the chase, Owen Wilson is starting to have doubts over the value of his life and his meaningless existence, and while both characters are shallow there is a great deal of joy in watching their ceaseless adolescent behaviour and the ridiculous rulebook they operate by. All of this changes of course when they decide to end their tenure as wedding crashers by crashing the wedding of the century, when Wilson meets the woman from heaven and Vaughn meets the clingy nutter from hell.The dialogue is great, yeah, not Woody Allen great but funny, and the characters all likable, with the exception of the villain of the piece who is played to perfection by Bradley Cooper as the scummy version of both Vaughn and Wilson.Add to this a couple of excellent cameo's, a vile old woman and a repressed artist and you have a bizarre mix that, yes, is a tad predictable, but like a journey to one of your favourite places, is one that you do enjoy nonetheless.Nuff said.Em",8,0,0,9 June 2008
Hancock," Seen it twice, What's the critics problem?
","John Hancock, is a man with superhuman powers, strong, invulnerable, flight, he has the usual bad boy powers. However, unlike other superhero's he really is a bad boy, not caring what he does, who he hurts as long as he gets the job done and winds up threatening more lives than he saves. That is until he saves loser PR man Ray Embrey, who realises that within Hancock, their really is a hero trying to get out. After taking him home to meet his family, he realises that he may be able to help him and turn Hancock into the hero he always could be. After doing exactly what no-one expects to do which is care about his previous actions, he then takes to becoming a true hero, acting against all he instincts he starts to turn into someone that people like and want to be, until his past, quite literally, sends him reeling.This is an Akiva Goldsman production and usually his name on a film is like having Cyanide as an ingredient on a drinks bottle, but, like Hancock himself, he acts against type here but letting someone else pen the work, and as such creates a film that is far better than it could have been. This is a film with some genuine surprising moments and a pretty decent script. When I was watching at first I hated Will Smith's Hancock and thought he was a real *sshole, and was not looking forward to watching his adventure, but this is what we're supposed to feel, Will's performance is spot on and he performs so well against his usual likable persona that it's a real compliment to his skills that he pulls this off so well. Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are equally great as the blissfully happy couple into whose lives Hancock crash lands.The script is far better than I thought it would be and while some elements are very Hollywood and clichéd (Especially near the end) this is still a very good film that is worth the price of admission and shows another side to both Will Smith's range and also Akiva Goldsman's skills. I can't say why the critics are having a go at this film as I have now seem it twice, not because I'm a big Will Smith fan, simply because it is a good movie. As I sat there the second time I was trying to think what set the film apart from other superhero studies, and, apart from the obvious that this does not come from a comic, the big thing is that, due to Will Smith's performance we get a glimpse of a hero who really feels, not bullets, or the impact of the train but feels for people around him and the makers really focus on this, this is not a film about a Superhero but a film about a super human.As you may have gathered by the rest of this review, the biggest surprise in this film is that while the trailer does feature many of the films interesting moments, there is so much to this film than what we see in the trailer. In fact in terms of the tone of the film it is very different to what we see in the trailer. I could say a lot more but to do so would spoil some of the surprises that you may not know about, and unlike some reviewers I'm not gonna do that.I think for most reviewers the big problem is that it's not Batman, the film they've already decided if the best cause Heath Ledger's dead. Truth is there is room for 2 good superhero films and this was the first of the year. Trust me.",8,1,2,31 July 2008
Inception," is it a dream, is it a nightmare, actually it's a bit of both (This really contains spoilers, don't read if not seen!)
","Cobb is an extractor, one of an elite group of people who are hired to go into people's subconscious' and steal their deepest secrets through their dreams. Simple enough, right? ...wrong! On their first mission in the film Cobb and the team mess up and they fail to get the very information they need, however, the mark who they try to extract from was impressed by their skills and offers Cobb and his team a job, not of extraction, but inception, the planting of an idea rather than it's removal, while some say it can't be done, others around Cobb, say it can. With the carrot dangling in front of Cobb of returning to America and seeing his children (something he cannot do) Cobb and his crew decide to take on this, hopefully, last job and return to the US rich and free, by creating a dream, within a dream, within a dream, but, of course, certain things do not go to plan.So, is Inception better than Dark Knight, everyone asks that like it's a tough question and yet it wouldn't be difficult not to be really. the grand idea's of dreams and reality, what is real or not is not bent to fit a genre like they were for Dark Knight, resulting in characters that had little to do with the origins on the page. Here the characters and ideas come straight from Nolan and he shows here, like he did in Memento he is often better when he does that (Although that said I am a fan of Batman Begins) DiCaprio shows here again just what a damn fine actor he is becoming and the film hangs on his ability to make Cobb so brilliant, yet hiding a truly disturbing flaw, that sucks us into the movie, almost perfectly (I'll get back to that later), support in Gordon-Levitt as Arthur is excellent and provides a serious practicality to proceedings as one of those who controls the dreams that they enter, Marion Cotillard is as good as she's ever been previously as Cobb's late wife who can't let go of Cobb's subconscious, with Tom Hardy and Tom Beringer being excellent in their more diminutive roles, the usual Nolan Stalwarts of Caine and Murphy also provide their usual skilled selves to proceedings. The direction is for the most part brilliant and assured as the pacey script lets Nolan show his ample talent for story-telling, although the direction on the snow action is tough as you don't know who or what is where sometimes.So, great enjoyment, right? Well yes. One of the best films ever ...er, well no. Sadly the film has its Persian flaw and that is that it is too clever for its own good. I found myself looking for clues to see if this was a dream constructed by Cobb, as his wife suggested, or reality as he suggested and 2 clues stood out a mile to prevent me enjoying the piece as much as I might if that was not on my mind (Cobb never has his own anchor in reality, instead carrying his wife's indicating he does not have an anchor on reality, also the dream timescale the chemist speaks of doesn't work unless you're already at least one layer down) and because I was always looking for the dream within a dream I couldn't let myself go and get sucked in and fooled the way I have with other films. If you read other reviews here many are either yes it's a masterpiece enthusiasm or no it's just awful, it's like these reviews are written by Spock or Kirk, with reality being somewhere in between.It is a good movie, it's not the best movie ever, and in my opinion Mon is actually the hero trying to save Cobb (the villain) from the prison that is his own mind.",8,4,10,31 July 2010
WALL·E," Not just one of the best animated films, but one of the best films of all time
","As the film starts in space with a song from Hello Dolly, you wonder just quite what you're getting yourself into. A few moments later we are transported to Earth, up-to-it's eyeballs in garbage, however help is at hand, in the cuboid shape of WALL-E, a waste allocation load lifter, Earth-class. Once WALL-E was part of a huge herd of robotic trash compactors built to help the human race get out of the mess it had made, while they stayed in space, waiting for everything to be sorted. However, it's 700 years later and only one WALL-E is left and on his own he has become a tad eccentric. With only a cockroach as a friend he spends his time doing his job and trying to learn more about the people who once inhabited this little world. Of course if that was the entire film it wouldn't be very good and shortly after it starts WALL-E is joined by EVE, a far more advanced model whose mission is a secret.This is Pixar's most ambitious film to date. From the moment the title appears and the music really kicks in we feel this is different to the cutesy world of superheroes and talking cars and animals that have gone before. This is a film that has elements that are grim, unsettling and ask difficult questions about what we are doing as custodian's of the planet. The script and story are an absolute triumph as the skill's of the animator's to make those hundred's of pixels perform in such charming, heart-warming ways is a joy to watch.The pacing of the film, unlike Nemo, The Incredibles and Cars is flawless and you get the feeling that a lot was sacrificed to keep that running time as tight and precise as it is. There is not a frame wasted, nor one shot too many. However, the thing that gets me most about this film, no matter how many times I watch this film I see something new that I haven't seen before. The lighting looks like a real film, the pauses and reactions from the robot performers are exquisite with more than a nod being shown to the silent pioneers at the turn of the last century who started this thing called cinema off. After watching this I think they'd be proud to see how far their medium has come.There's a saying that you can't polish a turd, and sadly in the media these days hundreds of millions of dollars are spent polishing so many expensive summer turds (Dark Knight anyone?) This was a joy to watch and discover that in spite of the stupidity of this business of show, there are still worlds full of sparkle, Barnaby! A Masterpiece of the medium.Nuff said.",9,5,9,27 January 2009
The Silence of the Lambs," 'I've no plans to call on you, Clarice. The world is more interesting with you in it' and the world is more interesting for this film being in it!
","Clarice Starling is a trainee FBI agent, and although we live in liberated times she is clearly regarded as decoration by most of her male compatriots, after all, she is a woman in a male dominated world. That said we know she is something special when she is the only one left in the elevator on the way to the top. She is asked to go on an assignment by Jack Crawford, a senior figure at the Bureau to profile serial killers, perhaps, to help profile a new killer, Buffalo Bill, a man who skins his victims, different patterns each time and all dumped in different places. The Killer she is given the job of profiling is the one that will not co-operate, the infamous killer Hannibal Lector, formerly a renowned psychiatrist before he went off the rails towards the siding known as insanity.And so Clarice begins a series of interviews with Lector where they both attempt a kind of intellectual and emotional sparring as they try to find out more about each other. As they get to know each other, with Clarice giving more in terms of info and Lector giving more in terms of soul they become unwitting colleagues in the race to stop Bill adding to his list of victims. This film is a modern classic in every sense of the word. The colour seems to have been bled from every frame leading to a drab and desolate world without hope or sympathy. The use of symbolism is some of the best I've ever seen with the bug motif occurring throughout and not just in terms of the killer's signature, be aware of how his eyes look in the night vision goggles, we know that Bees can see in ultra violet and the way in which his vision is turned into one colour is extremely bug-like, however the big parallel with bugs is at the end of the film (Spoiler alert) when we see the figure dying on the floor with the night vision goggles on, with the wounds on both sides of his chest, he dies like an insect, something that many people may not notice.The film is also clever in its usage of more familiar symbolism to make us feel certain ways. As Bill's next victim is driving along we see her singing to a song on the radio, not just singing the main words but flitting between backing and the main lyrics, just the way we all do, making us far more concerned than we would be if she was just driving home, by showing her doing what we all do, she becomes us and we fear far more for her future fate.However, this is not just a film about symbolism, this is a film about the decisions that we make and the decisions that we are forced to make. Clarice is sent on a path to the FBI after the death of her father, he was her world and all she seeks is his approval and by following in his footsteps it is the closest she can think to do that, this is a decision made by circumstance that is unavoidable, and she has no regrets over it. Hannibal by contrast goes fruit loop after dealing with endless whingy whiny patients with no problems when what he wants to do is deal with interesting problems. Somewhere along the way his mind snaps and the discussions that he would have no doubt enjoyed with Clarice are soured by the fact that there are bars between them, this regret is clearly etched on his face when they discus serial killers and Clarice says, so impassively, 'No, you ate yours', she knows what he is and he doesn't impress her like his mighty intellect should, because he is a killer and to her that is all he is, and, as he realises this and looks away it is this regret that is revealing. Lector loves battling or discussing intellectual matters with equals, and so few ever came his way, and the regret he feels over meeting Clarice clearly too late is portrayed beautifully by Anthony Hopkins who gives the performance of a lifetime in giving us this killer who still contains within him a human soul.This is the glory of this performance, although people have pointed out that his screen time is more warranting a supporting actor nod, there was simply no finer male performance, supporting or otherwise, and perhaps one of the greatest pieces of luck that the film enjoyed was Gene Hackman turning the role down. Anthony Hopkins doesn't just perform Lector, he inhabits him and we get treated to an amazing piece of acting that shows us that Serial Killers, the worst kind of people that there are, are still people, and that this is perhaps the saddest thing about them.To add to this great performance Jodie Foster not only gave a good performance but matched Hopkins perfectly, showing all of Clarice's strength's and vulnerability with such stunning realism that we feel almost every shiver that goes through her skin as she trawls society's bottom step in order to stop a monster feasting endlessly on victims that society does not care much about. Scott Glenn rounds off this acting triumvirate with a measured controlled performance that exactly matches his character.Jonathan Demme's direction is superb, the music compliments every scene with an uneasy balance that never allows you to settle in your seat and the script is first rate. After I thought about this film and considered how good it was I tried to think of some reason to give it a nine, and I couldn't. This film really is a ten and although the subject matter is not everyone's cup of tea, it is worthwhile for those who have a hard enough stomach.",10,1,1,13 July 2008
Iron Man," I'm going to Oz for a heart ...You certainly got it Tin Man!
","Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer with a jet-set Hugh Heffner style life (or lifestyle!) He lives to make new and innovative machines enjoys fast cars and even faster women. Kind of like Batman but with Tony Stark there is no playboy persona, there is simply a playboy personality. All of this changes when after a routine sales pitch in the middle east for his new weapon 'The Jericho', when terrorists using his own weapons capture him and decide to use his skills in order to make a new weapon for them. Using the limited time that he has he instead makes an armoured suit to get him and his captive translator out of there in one piece.After getting back to the US he has an epiphany and realises that his weapons are causing more harm than good and potentially all massed produced weapons can wind up in the wrong hands. The only logical thing to do is make one weapon that can be used by the right person to make a difference, and so is born Iron Man.Whilst I really enjoyed this film and thought it was supremely handled by the director of 'Zathura' and 'Elf' which came before, and the script was also fairly decent, though nothing spectacular, it is Robert Downey Jr's mesmerising performance that really allows the film to go from being a mere 'Hulk' to a 'Spiderman' standard. His personality is ideal and his change from stand alone, immune from criticism playboy to a man of integrity is handled with real skill.In my personal opinion this does not deserve to be as high as it is in the IMDb rankings. It certainly is enjoyable and unlike many films that start the blockbuster season it doesn't feel like the filler film to get things rolling, it is a decent film in its own right and maybe that's why it is in the top 250 as people are swept along in surprised delight by a superhero that they've never heard of before.Nuff said Em",8,1,2,12 June 2008
Casino Royale," Casino Royale - old dog director teaches ageing franchise some new tricks
","Bond is promoted for mere agent and grunt to the status of Intelligence Officer at the beginning of this film as he complete's the two kills to earn the double '0' status. From here he is sent in search of a bomb-maker to attempt to discover who his backers are. After a disastrous start where Bond makes just about every mistake possible he finally makes amends and after resolving these earlier mistakes winds up in a high-powered winner takes all poker game with Terrorist banker Le Chiffre, who needs to recoup losses and win the potential 15o million euro's pot against some of the best players of the world.So Bond returns (Or rather begins!) and if you believe the two sets of divulging reports on this site it was either the best bond ever, or the worst Bond ever, which may lead people to wonder how this could be? I had to admit when I first saw it, I was of mixed opinion to how I felt about it. On the one hand the set pieces where dealt with admirably by the always capable Martin Campbell. The opening action piece through the building site and the entire Casino sequence were excellent, and the look of the film was stunning, and exactly what you'd expect from a Bond; Both of his main vehicles (I am not including a Ford Hire car) where just what was wanted and although the Villain was no Goldfinger, he was much more of a threat than Jonathan Pryce or Robert Carlisle's dismal villains in both 'Tomorrow Never Dies' and 'The World is not enough'. Which then brings us to the main source of either delight or derision, which is Craig's performance.For me, Daniel Craig proves all the detractors and smug journo's who wrote disparaging comments before, completely wrong. The more you watch this performance and his depiction of an agent, not supremely knowledgeable and smug like earlier depictions, but a newly promoted young man with a point to prove. This is effectively the young man in a hurry, trying to prove that his promotion was a worthwhile piece of judgement and not an error on the part of a boss at risk from enemies without and within. Because of that, this Bond is intense and exposed, all of his frailties are open, and all of his skills are raw, which makes for a far more exciting film than the bond's of so many films who is always so reliably infallible.One of the other big problems for many is of course the product placement. Personally, I don't give a stuff what phone Bond uses, or the computer he types on, if they want to sponsor the film-makers with ridiculous amounts of money for these things just to be seen in the move then let them. The sponsor I found purposely funny was the Amiga watch and the comments around it within the film. When his watch was being discussed in the film it was done in the context of the expensive things that he wears not because he wants to, but because he has to, as part of him being arrogant and showy, rendering any kind of product placement useless.Overall this Bond is one that has grown on me hugely over time and I think in the same way that 'On her Majesty's Secret Service' is regarded as one of the finest Bond films of the series, 'Casino Royale' has now firmly established itself for the current crop of Bond fans and unlike it's predecessor 'Die Another Day' it has aged wonderfully well. A bond worth always worth another shot.",8,2,6,11 April 2009
Toy Story 3," 'You would not believe the day I am having!' How to make a successful trilogy
","The toys numbers are few. They are stored in a box, and there's little for them to do in there except go stir crazy as Andy grows up and heads for college, BUT, he has to sort out his room and his old toys, so what's his plan ...To put his best loved in the attack but take his best friend to college as a token of the youth he has now left behind, but who will go, Woody or Buzz, after deciding on Woody, he gets ready to put them in the attic, but things don't go to plan and the toys including Buzz are instead donated to a nursery, a place which looks like Paradise but is in fact no better than the boy next door's backyard. Will the toys escape from Sunnyside Prison nursery, will Woody get to go to college, will this film feel simply like a cashing-in add-on? When I heard the plot initially I had to say yes to the final question, I mean Andy giving his prized toy away, I mean everyone has a special toy who they love the most, right? And there lies the magic, Pixar don't do contradictions like that in there films, and in this one they stay absolutely loyal to everything that has gone before. The film is exciting, funny, terrifying and charming from one second to the next. Lotso the bear, the leader of the nursery toys is one of the most terrifying villains created by Pixar, precisely because he appears so cute and cuddly, and while children won't register it, I personally found the scene where Buzz was, effectively tortured to be very upsetting, but that's because we love these characters so much. The animation is as usual first rate and you know off the bat immediately that you're watching a Pixar film, the voice work, particularly by Hanks is stunning and with him and Tim Allen you get the feeling that they know these characters so well, it makes it that much more real, sucking all of us into this completely make believe world. The direction is top-drawer and well ...well I'll just stop because if I go on I'll just start using the same phrases everyone else does.I thought I might be watching a watered down version of Toy Story 2, I was wrong. Instead through these wonderful films we watched Andy grow up and all of us mourned the passing from children into adulthood with some brand new toys that will made us feel like kids all over again, for infinity and beyond.awesome",9,2,3,30 July 2010
The Ringer," what a shame for those who didn't get it
","I like many people saw the trailer for this film and instantly felt angry at the Farrelly's for crossing the line and taking the rip out of the disabled, after seeing it the only person having the rip taken out of him was johnny Knoxville who is brilliantly cast as the stooge of his addicted gambler uncle, Brian Cox.The story of a man who fakes mental disability in order to compete in the special Olympics and win money in a betting scandal seems like it would be just too awful to be believed. But after demanding to be considered for a management condition and given the job of firing Stavi the cleaner, Johnny Knoxville's nice guy character decides to hire him as a gardener, only for him to chop his fingers off. Needing several thousand dollars to pay his hospital bills, he takes the advice of his twisted uncle, played superbly by Brian Cox, to fake disability and rig the special Olympics.To those who doubt the quality of the film, I say trust the highest raters, this is a very funny film! Don't get me wrong film fans, if you want to see a classic comedy try Duck Soup and Annie Hall, but this is really funny and not only that but the film does have it's heart firmly in the right place.Like Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey this is one of the best underrated comedies and a true hidden gem.",8,4,4,18 June 2007
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Are the rumours true, Albus. I'm afraid so, both the good . . .and the bad.
","So, in the last chapter Harry and his friends, Hermione and Ron, are trying to hunt down Voldemort's horcrux's and in the previous film had managed to destroy one. Big woo! Three left then! While they are doing this they are also trying to avoid said Dark Lord and his followers who, if they find them, will make short shrift of them. So here it is, the final chapter of Harry Potter is upon is. If you believe the hype then this Harry Potter film sounds not dissimilar to the beginning of a tale of two cities. It is the best of films it is the worst of films, it has included everything but left out more, it is beautiful it is terrible, the cast are wooden the cast are fabulous, and so on and so on.So Is it any good. Well, yes it is. Is it the best Potter film so far? I'd still have to put Azkaban above it, not necessarily because it is a better film, but because it's when the films started to grow with us, like remembering a first kiss or a first crush, others may come, but memory tends to play around with us like that.David Yates' again shows us why he for the last for films he has been 'The man who would' tie everything together. The performances are excellent from all the cast, particularly from Rickman who has portrayed Snape so well for the last ten years with this film being his big pay-off.The script, which in a way just features two big scenes from deathly hallows, allows us to really feel the adventure for each character and one of the big problems with the final book, the final finale, is, in the film, handled with much more excitement and power which is really missing in the books, so hats off to Cloves and Yates there.Of course with anything like this there are going to be bits that we wish there'd been more of and bits that we wish they'd kept in (Like who the headmaster of Hogwarts is at the end) but after spending a few days getting to know our friends from Hogwarts again myself, I feel that this is a very satisfying ending to a saga middle-earthian in scope and yet like those self- same loved books, whose main strength comes from the very human condition that they represent on the smallest scale.As a film on it's own, very entertaining.As a film set ...a Triumph for all involved (apart from Mike Newell ...sorry!)",Null,0,0,17 July 2011
The Matrix," And I want to be someone important ...like an actor
","There is probably no better line in this film that illustrates the bizarre fallacy of out own daily lives than this.For Neo (Keanu Reeves) his daily life is a series of disjointed and disconnected segments as he works as a software programmer by day and at night works as a computer hacker of sorts. This world is crashed in on by three black suited individuals who want to know more about what Neo is doing and his attempts to make contact with an individual called Morpheus, who, we are told, is as a suspected terrorist. As the movie moves on the world around Neo seems to change by the second as he searches for answers to discover what the matrix is.'Unfortunately, no-one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.' and therein lies the big reveal as the Matrix is nothing like you anticipate or expect. After this all the rules that usually apply to films to action sequences to good and evil and even gravity are bent, twisted and downright broken as the film moves towards it's inevitable, pre-destined within it, conclusion. 'There is no spoon,'The Matrix was a groundbreaking film when it came out and whilst two inferior sequels have dimmed some of the appeal for people, if you do what I do, which is wilfully disregard them the same way that I do with the Highlander sequels, then you still have one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time, a film that leaves with you when you walk out of the pictures and makes you question every aspect of the world which we perceive to be the real world.When I first watched the film I was left totally baffled by Morpheus initial dialogue of what the Matrix was and then left spellbound when I discovered what lay beyond. The learning curve the Neo experiences, we experience with him, we fear when he is not the one, worry when we learn of the fate of Morpheus and cheer as lives out his predicted fate, the good, as well as the bad.The action sequences are breath taking and the lobby sequence is one of the most amazing of all time, yet the great thing about it, is that it means nothing without the rest of the movie wrapped round it.No bad scenes and no bad acting.The only downside, it was done in Doctor Who first and it's not Empire Strikes Back.still, an extremely worthy nine and deserves it's place in the 250.Wachowski's Maesterpiece",9,0,1,5 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," This will be a day long remembered - a review 33 years in the making
","A long time ago in a galaxy far far away a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker encounters two eccentric droids, gets attacked by sand people and is then saved by an old wizard by the name of Ben Kenobi. After a brief chat the farm boy discovers that Ben and Luke's father used to protect the universe as Jedi Knights until his father was killed by the evil Darth Vader. After his aunt and uncle are killed Luke realises his destiny has been chosen for him and he and Ben are going to have to take on the empire, and from this point movie history will never be the same again.Much has been said about this movie and it almost feels redundant to discuss it, but, as it was the first film I saw at the pictures I feel almost duty bound to add my two penneth to the mix and so I will. This film was groundbreaking in terms of effects, but what we have learnt since Star Wars is that all the good effects in the world can't save a poor movie. The thing that makes this movie as damned good as it is, is the mixture of urgent direction, wonderful performances, a damned good script, that often gets blasted as being terrible, (If it was the film would also be terrible ...it isn't, ergo sum ...), a pioneering use of sound effects that really reinforce the more alien characters with a real sense of emotion (specifically Chewbacca and R2-D2) but of course the last big star of the movie is John Williams sweeping epic score, which even today is probably one of the greatest pieces of movie music ever.These days I understand why a film like 'Casablanca' and 'Citizen Kane' cannot be appreciated by a modern audience because they are so hailed for their enormity on their first appearance that it often cannot be re-experienced by viewers after that. The first time we watch Star Wars we don't actually know that there is anything but Jawas on Tatooine, or that Obi-Wan Kenobi (That wizard's just a crazy old man) is a secret bad-@ss or that Han Solo, good for nothing mercenary, is seen right through by Jedi Knight Ben Kenobi. We who experienced it the first time will always feel it again, but the modern audience, who know so much about the film, cannot.The film is full of classic moments, from Ben Kenobi's reveal, R2-D2's fall, Luke switching off his targeting computer, Han's constant irreverent humour, Ben's 'that's no moon', and a dozen more, but even after all these years my favourite moment is that knowing look that Ben gives Luke at the end of his duel with Vader. His wry smile and the blend of music and performance by both Hamill and Guiness is sensational and still gives me goose bumps now. Amazing.Since then the impact of the original three may have been watered down by the prequels, but as much as you can't polish a turd, you also cannot dim the brightest star. Which is why the term 'May the force be with you' will always mean so much to so many.",9,5,7,17 February 2011
Jackie Brown," One of the best on-screen chemistries of all time
","Jackie Brown is an air stewardess who is paid by Illegal weapons supplier Ordell Robbie to bring his stash of money which is kept in storage by his silent partner in South America. After someone tips off that Jackie brings the money in she is arrested by the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agency and has to make a deal that will see her out of jail and get her as far away from Ordell Robbie as possible.You hear people constantly comparing Pulp and Jackie so if you want to read someone do that, please look at someone else's review. Jackie Brown is a masterclass in character driven movie making. There are numerous stand out scenes and everyone in this film has their moments (Apart from Robert Deniro, as the stoned up ex-con who cannot cope with the changes in the world upon his return.) But the real story in this film is with Jackie Brown and Max Cherry. Robert Forster's portrayal of Max is arguably one of the best performances by a supporting actor you will ever see. As Jackie's unrequited Lover he seethes pent-up emotion and the scene where he watches her in her apartment is like liquid silk pouring onto the screen. Also for Movie lovers everywhere that notice these things, do watch his face when he turns round in the mall and sees her sat down, it is the look of love that is virtual impossible to fake as his entire face lights up. Simply for Max Che ..., I'm sorry, Robert Forster's performance alone this is a must see, but add Pam Griers, unfortunate Oscar-overlook, outstanding performance and this film is a real treat.Although I loved pulp fiction, as many film fans are finding out, it is this baby that has legs.",9,0,1,15 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The only film that gets a 10
","And I've seen some great films. However, within this one it's the culmination of both fortuitous events and the craft and skill of everyone involved that makes this the best film of all time.If you start with the script, because many people leave this detail out, you realise how well crafted the dialogue is. This is no accident and arguably the key to this success was the work by Leigh Brackett, the woman that was also partly responsible for the script to the Bogey classic 'The Big Sleep'. I've often said that it you place Han and Leia's script in empire and compare the sparkling repartee between them and Marlow and Rutledge you could almost switch them between films (Those are harsh words to throw at a man, especially when he's walking out of your bedroom and sorry sweetheart, I haven't time for anything else, in particular).Then of course the luck factor kicks in. Bad luck at first with Mark Hamill's terrible bike accident which had to be explained with the wampa attack, which in turn leads to the scene where we see how Luke's powers are first coming along. Then arguably the best piece of lateral thinking. The obvious jedi master would be 6 feet tall and virtually indestructible, and rather than do that, they make Yoda anything but, they went the other way and created one of cinema's best realised fake characters. In Empire, Yoda is masterfully done and every scene with him is like a moment with a treasured Grandparent whose wisdom is strange but unquestionable. This is Yoda's film and is fantastic for it.The John williams score in this one is breathtaking, key moments, include the lifting of the X-wing and the confrontation between Lando and vader, so subtle, but so perfect.Finally the effects, the light sabre duel is arguably the best one ever put on film, as Luke's quick but not perfect yet, going up against a Jedi Warrior whose powers are second to only 2 others in the galaxy. Awesome, and as for the revelation, I thought he was lying when I was 10 years old, it is almost too unbelievable, but believable it is.First three aren't a patch and this one is George's masterpiece.10/10 Mikey B",10,8,14,26 January 2008
Jurassic Park," Gotta ask yourself the question ...where are you now?
","John Hammond is a PT Barnum style billionaire and as such wants to create the greatest show on Earth. Through the miracle of science and some preserved dinosaur DNA trapped in amber he recreates an entire range of dinosaur species. To check out his island he invites a number of scientists to endorse it for the brochure or something. Anyway after invoking Murphy's law (What can go wrong will go wrong) it all goes wrong and the Doctor's soon find themselves at the wrong end of the dinosaur experience.At the time this was the most successful film of all time. I never really saw why? There were lots of other films before (Jaws, Star Wars, Raiders) and since (Matrix, Inception, Transformers, even) that are all better paced, acted, written special effects-ed. The beginning sequence when a worker is eaten and they try to shock it looks, well, cheap to be honest. Due to them using multi-coloured lights in the container it looks like a disco. This opening thrilling bit didn't work me, and then the pace of the film slows down even more as we then get a huge preamble until anything exciting actually happens as plot plot plot plot plot is explained over and over and over again. Eventually we get to the good stuff and some actual dinosaur moments as the T-Rex finally appears, but then we get to the real killer, the thing that trashes the movie, the set piece with the car falling down the ravine that isn't there. We watch the dinosaurs walk out of a flat pen and then five minutes later that isn't a flat pen, but a massive drop ravine. It's just utter nonsense and from that point I had switched off as clearly the makers had so little regard for the viewer they thought that they could have anything happen and no-one will question it. This is no minor effect error or continuity blooper, it's an entire set piece that forgets where people have walked out of. For a movie this hyped it's just not good enough.At the time it was praised by critics as being one of the best films ever. While it's sad that it's still far higher than it should be (try watching it again, folks. It's slow as hell)nit's good to see that some element of sanity has returned to this films rating.That said it's a five alone for Bob Pecks thighs, they're stunning and they're not even an effect.",5,2,8,31 January 2011
Valkyrie," A good historical film always makes you want to find out more
","As the film starts we see the oath taken by the German army as thanks for not making the Nazi stormtroopers swell their ranks. In Tunisia the German troops are battling the British and the allies. Colonel Von Stauffenberg is a young officer who believes that Hitler is a threat not just to Germany but the entire world. After suffering a terrible injury after a British attack, Von Stauffenberg is relocated to Berlin, were as fortune would have it, he comes across the conspirators who are trying to kill Hitler but have failed in their last 14 attempts. Von Stauffenberg believes that as long as they can get a plan to take over from the SS and Gestapo after Hitler was gone, then it could well be 15th time lucky. Using Hitler's own plan 'Valkyrie', the emergency plan for the military to retain control if the Wolf's Lair ever became cut off, Von Stauffenberg comes up with a fool proof plan to eliminate one of the most evil men in history.Thus begins one of the most tense two hours I have spent in the cinema as you will the conspirators to succeed and fret at every step of the way that the SS or Gestapo may be on their heels, ready to burst through a door any second and take down each and every one of them. The mood of the period and the attention to detail is excellent, with one of the best ensemble casts of the year so far. Singer's direction is great and I for one learnt a hell of a lot about just how close we came to ending the second world war nine months early.The thing I find strangest about this film is the critical mauling the film has received. Everyone I have spoken to has loved it, found it fascinating and came away with a desire to learn even more about Stauffenberg and the rest of the conspirators, so what's with the downplaying of it. I imagine one reason is the fact that the media have it in for Cruise at the moment and so he can't do anything right, even when he's on form. I also think that the fact that there aren't that many speaking roles for women in the film is another reason for some negative reactions. Well here's the thing about that focus group folks, THERE WEREN'T ANY WOMEN GENERALS THEN! I don't expect action heroes to suddenly start shooting the set up on 'When Harry met Sally', 'How to lose a guy in 10 days' or '50 first dates', so deal with the women's roles in this film.I think the other reason that many people find a film like this hard-going is that it's hard from them to separate the Nazi's from the German army at the time or understand the sanctity of the oath they took towards the Furher or the reasons why? This is not an easy war film or one that fits into our perceptions like many of the Vietnam war pictures do. This gives us a moment in time when, if things had gone better, millions of lives could have been saved.Don't believe the gripe! Nuff said.",8,7,11,6 February 2009
All the President's Men," superb adaptation of an awesome book
","In 1972 the A-team broke out of a maximum security stockade in television history. In reality 4 people broke into the national democratic headquarters with wire-tapping equipment in the Watergate building in Washington and what started out as a small time robbery wound up escalating rapidly as a world of deception, infiltration and downright deceit was unravelled in the ensuing investigation by two Washington Post journalists whose contrasting styles are brought to life with gifted aplomb by two Hollywood heavyweights, Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman.Through their eyes we see an underground world where winning by any means necessary is acceptable, where slander, libel and racist slurs are perfectly acceptable tools to beat your opponent, and that the very people that are sworn to protect us are sometimes those that we should be protected from.That this is all based on a true story is all the more terrifying and yet when watching the film you can't take your eyes off it. The script is one of the finest that there's ever been and is a perfect adaptation of the Pulitzer prize winning book. The film moves like a detective thriller and if you don't know the full story I will refrain from telling you the end, even though most people already know what happened.However, unlike many on here I can steer them right to why it was pipped to best film by 'Rocky' at the academy awards. As a true story that America was visibly hurt and recovering from it was a film that people needed to see to recognise how the dream of democracy had fallen away, but they needed 'Rocky' to win to remind themselves of the dream that America should try to be.Nuff said Em",9,2,2,12 June 2008
