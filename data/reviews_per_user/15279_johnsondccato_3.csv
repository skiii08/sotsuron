50 First Dates," I see it and enjoy it very much
","50 First Dates is Drew Barrymore's finest! What a sweet movie! Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, Hawaii's Casinova, who goes after women for a one night stand- but that all changes when Henry spots Lucy, a local, in a restaurant. The two of them hit it off magnificently and they make a date to meet for breakfast the next morning in the same place. When Henry approaches Lucy the next day, she doesn't remember who he is at all. Turns out that she was in an accident and has short term memory loss.The movie was truly great. One of my all time favorites. Adam Sandler is a good actor and Drew Barrymore was terrific. The movie has the most beautifully sweet ending ever (By the way, I suggest watching it at midnight when you feel emotional- makes it even better). A definite must-see.",10,1,1,17 October 2014
World War Z," Great movie
","This movie based upon the apocalyptic horror novel by Max Brooks, tells the story of Gerry Lane a former UN Special investigator. Gerry Lane is in a race against the clock to stop a viral pandemic that turns people into ferocious, very mobile, zombies.I absolutely love this movie forthe fast pace action, a straight forward plot that twists and keeps you at the edge of your seat to find out how this story unfolds. Brad Pitt is brilliant and believable, as is the rest of the cast. However I do wish we could have seen how the virus strain came to be, but that doesn't take away from the luster of this film.",10,7,11,17 October 2014
Jack Reacher," Great and action movie.
","I was not expecting much from this film going into it, but I have to say I was really impressed with it. The action, the plot twists and the characters were great. Count me as part of the crowd that thinks Cruise makes an awesome Jack Reacher. The whole 'but he's not 6'5' argument doesn't hold water, IMO. Badasses come in all shapes and sizes. Besides, as in most of Cruise's films, the viewer can't easily tell that he isn't a large man as described in the novels by the way they cast the other actors, etc. It's really a non-issue.And it was nice to see Hollywood get more realistic fight scenes in a film for a change. I don't recall the particular martial art that they had Cruise train in for this role, but it seemed pretty realistic to how real street fights go down and the appropriate defense responses for such fights.I rarely want to view most films for a second viewing, but I look forward to watching this one again.",10,2,4,17 October 2014
