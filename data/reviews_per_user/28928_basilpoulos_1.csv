Casablanca," A truly great movie
","In regards to the classic film 'Casablanca', Mr. Doyle erroneously stated that Victor Francen appeared in the film. Tho Mr. Francen was an excellent character actor, he never appeared in 'Casablanca'. All in all, for a film that was shot on a less then large budget, it still remains one of my all time favorites. Ironically, two actors who appeared in the film were ardent anti-Nazis, Helmut Dantine and Conrad Veidt. Mr. Veidt died in the mid 40s and never returned to Germany. Mr. Dantine who would play many roles as a Nazi after 'Casablanca' , unfortunately lost both his parents in Nazi concentration camps. But as the line goes in 'Casablanca', 'everybody meets at Rick's' and all their performances were top notch.",Null,1,2,13 September 2005
