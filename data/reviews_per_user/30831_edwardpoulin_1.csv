United 93," An Amazing Movie about Hero's!
","As a United Flight Attendant in NYC, I am proud of my colleagues who were on United 93. Actress Trish Gates portrayal of Sandra Bradshaw shows her as the true hero she is. The directors sensitivity is amazing and so is this film! The people who are afraid to see this movie show reconsider, it is one of hero's and standing up to fight for our freedoms. The passengers and crew stood up and fought back. The insight to the breakdown in communications of our government boggles the mind. In less then 1 1/2 hours thousands were dead and we were unprepared. Human nature stood tall on United 93 as they were all alone in the skies but they will remain in my heart forever.",10,0,3,1 May 2006
