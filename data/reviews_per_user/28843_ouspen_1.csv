It," Better adaptation
","I really enjoy the movie, i don't understand all the low reviews. The kids are great, the environment is great, of you want a gore movie better go find another option. The movie is more pleasant if you already read the book, but is not really necessary to enjoy the ride. The problem is compare this 'remake' ( that is not very accurate, the other version is just for TV) JUST ENJOY!!!",8,2,3,29 September 2017
