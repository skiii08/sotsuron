Men in Black 3," Fun loving and fancy free, MIBIII is another classic in the series
","While the anecdotes are aged and the plot line fairly thin, MIBIII is still a great addition to the series! Jermaine Clement (squee) is fantastic as the feared villain and our two Agents, J and K are pushing the space time continuum to it's absolute. Creating a universe worth living in. With bopping tunes from the Smith Meister, this movie will chill out the most stoic fan and provides that ultimate feel good chill out movie. Griffin, our new found hero is an amazing addition and I felt enchanted watching him. The story line was a tad unconventional which added to the effect that MIB movies always have, managing to surprise you again and again with random facts (or are they?) action packed fighting and hilarious hilarity! This movie is suitable for all people (and other lifeforms of course). Except those who are too serious. Put it in the player, remember it's the Men In Black (uh) Here Come the MiB's! and enjoy!",6,0,2,8 December 2012
