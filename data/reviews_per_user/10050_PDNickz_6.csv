Minority Report," ParadoxodaraP
","I spent the first 2/3 of Minority Report enjoying the suspense and just riding the story's wave. I spent the last 1/3 of it trying to wrap my head around the inexplicably impossible paradox that the story centers around. I found myself asking: 'So, if I put a jar of jelly on a counter in a diner across town I can know for a fact that the guy sitting next to me is going to go eat it tonight?' Maybe my brain is slowing down as the result of any number of abusive practices... but this movie just flat out doesn't work. When I can walk through the plot holes in a film I get lost in them and forget to watch the rest.",Null,0,0,8 August 2002
Hostel," See the preview. Skip the movie. (*SPOILERS*, kinda)
","Oh, how excited I was to see Hostel. The promise of a good, nasty throwback to the 70s exploitation flicks of yesteryear, the promise of terror and brutality, up there on the big screen, clawing the audience's eyes out while we keep a nice, safe distance, free to shield ourselves and whimper in fear.Oh, and Quentin Tarantino was involved, so you KNOW it has to be edgy and unique... apparently. And, landie dearie me, folks, the biggest reaction the film got from the audience was when - in one scene - Pulp Fiction happened to be on television. I don't think anyone would have bothered with this movie if the title hadn't been under Tarantino's name in the previews. Going in to see Hostel I'd already seen Cabin Fever, Eli Roth's first outing into gore/horror/slapstick/whatever cinema, and I loved it. Absolutely loved it. I loved it in that way that any movie that is so damn weird and entertaining deserves to be loved.Coming out of Hostel I wish I had stayed home and rented Cabin Fever.I went with two friends... Meg and Alan. Alan is a huge fan of movies in general and Cabin Fever, specifically. Meg hails from Hiroshima, and after a lifetime of Japanese horror flicks she has developed quite an appetite for scary movies. I just like to have a good time.We were all pretty disappointed.The first half of Hostel was absurd. For anyone under the age of 14 who really, really, REALLY likes to masturbate, the first hour of Hostel will be bliss, I assure you. I have never seen so much nudity in one sitting (outside of a porno flick, at least) and I cringe to think that I may ever, ever encounter a naked woman ever again in my entire life, because Hostel has pretty much broken me of ever wanting to see that. So, dare I say it, but way too many boobies, kids.We are handed a few characters and by virtue of the fact that they're on the screen we're expected to care about them. Unfortunately, that doesn't really work and so all we have to get us through this movie are some people on the screen with whom we can't relate and for whom we feel no real attachment. The absurdity of these people and how little it was that we cared about them pretty much boils down to the fact that Alan was far more interested in the loud guy sitting behind him (as was I) and Meg kept asking me what the Japanese characters in the film were saying... because they were speaking gibberish... with incredibly phony and - Meg informed us - incredibly offensive accents: 'Tlain... we go to tlain station.' Indeed, the Japanese people on the screen didn't sound anything like the Japanese person sitting next to me. I find myself wondering, now, how many European cultures Roth was able to alienate through similar ignorance... there are a LOT of accents in Hostel.So, after all the sex and boobies and drinking are out of the way, some of the characters get killed, we see some good special effects and some terrible special effects but we really don't care in the least, we sit through a few scenes that are supposed to be tense or humorous or both (but they're just dull) and then the movie ends.Herein lie the spoilers:Things I Have Learned From Watching Hostel1) Women are there for one reason and one reason only: sex. This includes your mothers and sisters... if you can't bang 'em, they're useless to you. Don't forget that. 2) Homosexuality is evil and easily equivocated with brutal torture, much like Haute Tension, in that respect. 3) If you give children gum they will mercilessly kill for you, even though you can't explain to them what you want because you don't speak their language. 4) People really, really, really like to text message during movies... a LOT. 5) It is necessary to operate in absolute secret to seduce and kidnap people to sell them to an underground snuff club, even though every single person for miles around (including the police) are perfectly aware of said underground snuff club, and it really isn't all that secret in the least. 6) If you lose an eye, escape certain death and are on your way to freedom you will commit suicide because at the last moment you discover that you've lost an eye and are - we can only assume - ugly and unfit to live, so you might as well dive in front of the nearest locomotive. This only applies to women, who are only good for sex. Disfigured men can go about their lives as usual. 7) You can sucker audiences into watching anything so long as you hype it enough.And, with regards to number 7, this seems to be the perfect, PERFECT example of a movie being over-hyped. I have never seen such a packed theater and at the same time I have never seen so many bored viewers. Nothing captivating happens during Hostel, it's impossible to care about the characters and after the first hour of nudity and debauchery, there's no room left to tell a real story. The concept is spectacular, but it wasn't given any room to move.I was hoping to feel upset or disturbed by Hostel or to at least have something to think about after seeing the movie (the only lingering thought, that quickly faded, was: yeah, Europeans hate Americans... and water is wet, what else you got?). All that I felt, even the next day, was that I better write to the distributor and demand my money back so that I can give it to the guy who was sitting behind Alan... now THAT guy was the real entertainment!",2,2,4,9 January 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," New Zealanders do good.
","Of course I was impressed with the film when I saw it in the theater. Anyone who wasn't is probably lying or knows nothing about filmmaking (I'm not trying to be cruel here, but layer for layer and pound for pound this is one incredible undertaking). After watching the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen and after scrutinizing it on DVD for the better part of the summer (bootlegged) I just recently took a gander at the legitimate DVD release. I spent most of my time watching this film playing the How'd They Do That Game. The first few times I just absorbed it. Then I got to work looking for zippers and wires and I found very few. I was and still am and always will be amazed at the work that went into making this film. Special effects aside, the love that the filmmakers had to have for the material is nothing short of miraculous. I don't want to flog a dead horse and I honestly can't praise this film's efforts enough but the more I learn about the process involved in getting this onto the screen the more I love it. That's all I can say. Really incredible. Read up on it, you won't be disappointed.",Null,0,0,8 August 2002
Spider-Man," Here's why I like Spider-Man.
","Here's why I like Spider-Man: I've been waiting to see a Spider-Man movie since I was seven years old. I'm not talking about the old 1970s Guy In Tights Throwing Ropes Around movies... I'm talking a serious, hard core, unflinching, unabashed, no-shame Spider-Man movie. And now I've got one. If I wasn't such a huge Spider-Man nostalgia victim I would probably hate the movie. But, as it stands, I am hopelessly entangled. 'Blah blah blah, Hollywood sucks, blah blah blah, stupid movie.' You don't say. I loved it. It was nothing to write home about... but it was Spider-Man, dammit! Let me have my fun!",Null,1,2,8 August 2002
The Exorcist," Scares the crap out of me time and time again.
","Yeah... that pretty much says it all. The Exorcist is one of those movies that is going to continue to have an effect upon audiences for a long time. It'll get you, too. Don't worry. You'll find something in it that freaks you right the hell out someday. The performances are great. The use of light is absolutely perfect, particularly when it comes to hiding creepy iconography in the shadows that you're not reeeeally sure you saw in the first place. It is probably one of the only movies that consistently scares me, hand in hand with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It IS dated, and lends itself to moments of retrospective absurdity for audiences more used to modern conventions - both social and cinematic. But, when you get right down to it... it's damn creepy. Really damn creepy. I mean... damn. Creepy.",Null,0,1,8 August 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," I'm going to stand in line to get my money back...
","After I saw the Matrix, back in the idyllic 90's, I spent a good three hours waxing philosophic on the nature of reality with my fellow viewers.After I saw the Matrix Reloaded, I wanted to personally contact the filmmakers and ask for my money back. My buddy pointed out that I'd probably have to take a number.A LOT of fuss has been made about this film, but none of it really stacks up. As a transitory piece I'm sure it works quite well, storywise. As a dime a dozen kung-fu flick it works wonderfully. But, as a self-proclaimed staple in 'hard sci-fi' moviedom, it falls flatter than flat.The character development is limited to Morpheus and his crumbling beliefs, a concept and a story thread that feels extremely alien after the revelations of the first film. The story goes from point A, trips over dozens of fight scenes (most of them unnecessary) and grueling philosophical expositions (we, as an audience, can think for ourselves, I'd like to imagine) and finally reaches point B, which could have been met about 20 minutes into the film had the special digital effects gods not been at the helm.I will admit that the scene on the freeway was truly impressive, and I found myself fixed to the screen. Beyond that, though, action scenes are action scenes wherever you go, and even though I can fully appreciate the tremendous amount of work that goes into them, if you cook a full course steak dinner for your date, you have to accept the fact that she might just be happy with the appetizer. I very much would have been happy with an appetizer on this one.Still, I was pleased with the social commentaries maintained in the film, particularly the racial representation and power structure (where The Man is is always a white guy in a suit, and the downtrodden come from all walks of life)... those were very nice.Aside from that, and Fishbourne's incredibly intense presence, there isn't too much working for the Matrix Reloaded (except for a ton of money and merchandising, that is... funny how that works out, isn't it?)",Null,0,0,18 May 2003
