Casablanca," It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This!
","So often quoted yet the quotes do not accurately recant the lines. Most famous of these...'Play it again Sam'. The true mark of a classic beloved movie. The heroes and the villains are equally revered. Probably the greatest assemblage of international acting talent filmed during the penultimate period of international stress. It reflected the contradictions people have between personal wants and needs, and those that encompass the greater good.This film begs for young and old alike to be transfixed by the acting, the storyline, and an ending which leaves everyone a sense of honor and fulfillment. I strongly recommend, if you become or are a fan of Casablanca, to read the book...Round Up The Usual Suspects. It'll give you insights into the filming and the accidents of fate which helped create this American movie legend and made Bogart a film icon forever.",Null,1,1,14 September 2000
The Doors," A great study of a very complex and talented rock idol.
","For those of us that grew up in the sixties and seventies many remember wild parties, rampant availability of drugs, emotional distancing from our gov't and the war, and rock 'n roll. It was a time of social involvement and tuning out. And it was a time that saw music icons become our evangelists.Jim Morrison was that type for many. A UCLA dropout whose mystical lyrics and style masked a deep pain about his family upbringing. A character so complex that even the other band members were both in awe and disgust over the guy who was clearly the heart of the group. Morrison's life and death is a topic of legend and Oliver Stone does a marvelous job bringing all those complexities to film. The technical way the film is shot is terrific and helps to recreate the haziness that pervaded much of the late sixties.
But it is Val Kilmer's incredible performance that stands out above even the film. He so 'nails' the character that as the movie moves forward you'd swear Kilmer and Morrison are one. Much in the same way Gary Busey was Buddy Holly, in his portrayal, Kilmer is Morrison. Also, as Busey should have won an Academy Award for his performance so should have Kilmer.The dialogue, dress, attitudes, style are all period. The music, for anyone familiar with the short but terrific contribution of the group, is outstanding. This is a movie, that despite its length, keeps you riveted and keeps me coming back from time to time.",Null,1,1,26 October 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," I liked it just as it is.....
","A delightful romp through one year of a young woman clearly looking for the right man and the love she's been missing. Renee Zelleweger is terrific as Bridget and is equally complimented by Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. But the whole cast works here...from Bridget's parents played by the versatile Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones, to her supportive and somewhat dysfunctional friends, to her work colleagues. In this case the American actress, Zelleweger, clearly has to prove she can perform alongside the dry wit and humor of a thoroughly wonderful British ensemble cast. Does she ever!!! I thought she should have gotten the Oscar...she was that good. Ordinarily an American actor trying to come off authentic in a British accent doesn't work very well (see Brando's Fletcher Christian/Mutiny On The Bounty-1962) but Zelleweger not only does it well she sounds downright genuine.Everything about this film works and word is out that they begin a sequel in Nov.'03 to be released in 2004. Usually I cringe when sequels are made, especially when comedy is involved, but my hopes are high here. Let's see where do they take it...does Bridget marry Mark Darcy, how does Daniel Clever re-enter Bridget's life...humm?",Null,0,0,6 August 2003
The Insider," At last the story is told.....
","This movie probably rates, against my other ratings an 8, but I gave it a 9 due to the story and the performances of Pacino and Crowe. Captivating story of the uncovering of the cigarette industry's deceptions and lies taken from the true story. The compelling acting brings the duality of conscience and company loyalties into play.This movie will be a riveting 2 hours and 35 minutes and I would recommend it to anyone interested in high drama, great screenplay, and terrific acting.",Null,0,0,16 May 2001
Annie Hall," 'La di da, la di da' says it all !!!
","Quite frankly one of the best comedies ever. Superb performances, terrific writing, and Allen's acerbic wit, self deprecation, and biting sarcasm about relationships and love make this 'Best Picture' a classic and timeless.From Diane Keaton's clothing (which caused a trend in women's fashion), to the scene with Woody cooking a lobster, to Tony Roberts in his Alpha Rays protection suit, to the scene of a very young Christopher Walken driving Allen and Keaton in a driving rain after confessing to Allen (Alvie Singer) his dreams of a glorious death this film contains scenes and dialog you'll use in everyday life.Sometimes, in Woody Allen films, he can go a bit over the top with his penchant for satirizing dysfunctional love relationships. In this movie you find he has blended just the right touch of all elements of his humor, his view of relationships, and his bias in favor of the culture and insanity that is New York versus his distaste for the pretentious plastic LA, Hollywood environment.In looking at the voting record I was astounded to see any votes under a FIVE. I respect my fellow IMDb viewers but anyone going below a FOUR for this movie either doesn't like Woody Allen personally, doesn't get his humor, or somehow cannot wrap their arms around the kind of comedy that can poke fun at everything from religion, to politics, to education, and toward themselves. This film should be required viewing in any film study class in college.",Null,0,0,22 July 2006

Rocky," An underdog film, actor, and character all win here!
","In the mid 1970's Sylvester Stallone was a married man with limited acting experience, no money in the bank, and only an idea for a story which in many ways was semi-autobiographical. Despite being broke, with a baby on the way, Stallone shopped his story of a pug club fighter given the opportunity of a lifetime to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world. It was a loose story based on Chuck Wepner's fight with Muhammed Ali. But it was also about perseverance, opportunity, and then raw guts...all of which Stallone exhibited by rejecting a $400,000 offer for the script that would have had another actor play the role Stallone said was his...that of Rocky Balboa.Finally with assurances in hand that he would play Balboa the film was made, but it was low budget. None the less this film took critics and the movie public by storm. Men and women fell in love with the bullish southpaw club fighter from Philly, the Italian Stallion, and people flocked to theatres. With some outstanding support from Talia Shire (Adrienne), Burt Young (Paulie), and the late great Burgess Meredith as Mick this film took the Academy Award for Best Picture. I believe only two factors prevented Stallone from winning the Best Actor award that year. The untimely death, and great performance, of Peter Finch in Network and, to a probably lesser degree, a simmering resentment toward this relative newcomer (Stallone) to the Hollywood superstar club. Sometimes the Academy will reward a new fresh face and sometimes the underlying message is 'earn our respect'. This was probably Stallone's best opportunity to be awarded the prestigious gold statue as his future films were in the super-heroic, action character segment which can do, and did do, great at the box office but does not often resonate with the academy.Someday I believe the academy will present Stallone a lifetime achievement award in recognition of years of contribution to the movie making community and an acknowledgment of his international appeal.",Null,0,1,24 September 2001
Pulp Fiction," QuentinTarantino at his best
","Pulp Fiction is gaining that special status as time goes by. It is becoming a film classic and a must see for generations now coming of age. A metaphor for what Tarantino does here with the storyline is what a magician does with torn paper. We all know the trick...the magician has a participant from the crowd take a piece of paper and tear it up in front of the audience. He places the paper into a top hat, waves the magic wand, and voilà...the paper is whole again.Tarantino does that with the storyline. Scenes shift to different time sequences yet all tie together at the end. The genius is that the viewer must now take the scenes and rearrange them to understand the true sequence. It is, by all accounts, brilliant.The film is responsible for resurrecting the career of John Travolta. At this time Travolta was somewhat of a failed commodity in Hollywood. His performance here proved he could do some seriously good acting. Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhimes, Bruce Willis, and Uma Thurman all provide standout performances as do all the other actors. Of special note are two of the greatest actors in Hollywood who had somewhat small roles. As Shakespeare said 'there are no small parts, just small actors'. That is why Harvey Keitel is so memorable in his role, and Christopher Walkin in his.Rent the movie, buy the movie, tape it from cable (do not see it on network TV you'll hate yourself if that is the way you see it) but see this movie. After you've seen it once, think about it a little bit and then wait a little while and see it again...that is how good this flick is!",Null,1,3,4 March 2006
Thirteen Days," My vote reflects the importance of the topic and film depiction
","Aside from Kevin Costners' poor New England accent this film is golden. If Costner had played it straight I'd have preferred it but with that said the subject is entirely riveting. Rarely is the outcome of the story known so well beforehand and yet the movie keeps you on the edge all the way through. Since most American's these days learn their history from movies I am glad this one is very accurate.The historical events are almost on target to a tee. The subjective license has to do with the actual influences and dialogue between JFK, RFK, the Joint Chiefs, and JFK's chief advisors of which Costner plays the key man, Kenny O'Donnell.I saw this movie with my mom and niece and it was great because we had my mom(who was in her late 30's in '62, I was 8 yrs. old and my niece had not yet been born. Afterward we were able to discuss the events as they were shown in the movie and recall and reflect the times for my niece who, now at 27 was so moved by the closeness we came to an all out war with the Soviet Union.I would highly recommend this movie, especially for the generation born after 1965. It will reflect the tenuous times we lived in during the height of the Cold War.",Null,0,1,29 March 2001
