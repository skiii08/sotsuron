Requiem for a Dream," Sad......
","The Story The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines.The Facts Requiem for a Dream is one of the most depressing films that I have seen in a long time. It is hard for me to rate the film itself. I'm tied between a seven and an eight. It is a film that I can only handle to watch once or twice. After viewing it the first time I felt as if I needed a vacation. I felt I was in a hellish nightmare. The director did a great job pulling it off. It feels too real. It felt like it happened to someone I loved and cared about. The film's imagery is unforgettable. It is hard for anyone to forget. It is a terrifying and beautiful film all at once. Many viewers may not be able to handle the film. It takes place during the span of three seasons: summer (everyting is alive and luscious), fall (things start to take a turn for the worst), and winter (everything is cold and dead). It was easily the best film of 2000. The plot is heartfelt and never lets up on the viewer until the rolling credits. It is sure to be unbelievable. The direction is great. Aronofsky does everything with style and emotion. The acting is absolutely amazing. Ellen Burstyn is by far the most memorable and tragic character in the film. Every character is loved by the audience. It's sad that the only one who has a chance of saving themself is Marlon Wayans character, who will still have a hard time. The acting and characters are some of the best brought to screen. I haven't read the book that the film is based on, but I bet this is a great adaption from it. The film's score is fantastic. It does every scene justice. I loved it! I recommend this film to anyone, especially if they are planning on using drugs or have recently started. Requiem for a Dream is a ultimately painstaking event, but it all pays off in the end. Do not miss this one you guys.",7,1,2,3 February 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of Kubrick's Best!
","The Story Story follows the ascent of mankind into the near-future space age through minimalist performances and a strong visual style.The FactsUpon my first viewing of 2001: A Space Odyssey I was deeply disappointed with it. I found myself bored and confused. I turned the film off at the end and went to bed. I was angry. The next day I talked to others and ultimately watched it over. During this viewing I saw what Kubrick was trying to bring to the viewer's mind. I understood the subject and the ending a lot more. If I had not asked questions and watched the piece again I could still be disgruntled with it. 2001's plot is great. It brings controversy to the audience, like most of Kubrick's films. The direction from Kubrick is, as always, fantastic. This may be the most visually stunning film I have ever seen. There are some shots that I will never forget. Kubrick has become one of the greatest directors of all time, in my eyes. The acting was all good. No performance really caught my eyes. They all seemed okay. The characters are good. None are really unforgettable. HAL will probably be the most memorable for me. The score was fantastic. It was great for the film, and could not have been done any other way. 2001 will awe many audiences for years to come. 2001 wasn't as boring as I had been told, either.",10,0,2,3 February 2005
A Clockwork Orange," One of The Best Film's Ever Made!
","The StoryStanley Kubrick's dystopian masterpiece is set in the near future where urban thugs run wild and new methods of crime deterrence are being explored. Career gang member Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is nabbed by the police and offered the chance to a commuted sentence if he undergoes a kind of surgical therapy. One where his brain does not allow him to execute his violent urges.What is A Clockwork Orange?a clockwork (mechanical, artificial, robotic) human being (orange - similar to orang-utan, a hairy ape-like creature), and the Cockney phrase from East London, 'as queer as a clockwork orange' - indicating something bizarre internally, but appearing natural, human, and normal on the surfaceThe FactsA Clockwork Orange was released in 1971. It was made for around 2,000,000 dollars and pulled in around 26,000,000 dollars at the box office. I believe it originally got an 'X' rating. If I'm not mistaken it was one of two movies to get an original 'X' rating and get nominated for best picture at The Academy Awards. The film was banned in the UK until 1999 when Stanley Kubrick, the director, died. I think he got death threats from the film's release in the UK so he decided not to have it released there until he died. In 1973 it was released with an 'R' rating. In my opinion A Clockwork Orange is one of the best films ever made. I loved it the first time that I saw it. That may mean that I'm really screwed up or that I have decent taste in movies. A Clockwork Orange is based on a novel by Anthony Burgess that I have not read. It was released in 1962 if I'm not mistaken. The book as well as the film was controversial in it's original release. To me, A Clockwork Orange is one big piece of art. I'm not sure if it is just the direction or all the symbolism in the picture. I can see why some are turned off by the film but most enjoy it. This was the second Stanley Kubrick film I had seen. The first film I saw of his was The Shining. I saw it when I was nine or ten. It was made nine years after this picture. Stanley Kubrick has said that if Malcolm McDowell was not available he would probably not have even made this picture. Imagine a world with no Clockwork Orange. From all of the reviews I have read for this film everyone agrees that it is a good adaption of the book and very close to it. The main job of the film is to make us, as an audience, connect with the hoodlum Alex. In the beginning I was disgusted with him and despised him. Maybe I'm screwed up but by the end of the picture I care for him and, that is where Kubrick succeeds the most with this film. Kubrick's touch shines in this classic like a star. His artistic feel gives the film a unique and beautiful premise. All the acting is good. Malcolm McDowell is easily the best. No one could have portrayed Alex like him. The picture itself has lots of violence and nudity. At first it just disturbed me, but I grew with the premise and it did not bother me as much. If I were you I would watch it alone. You may get embarrassed easily if you watch it with others. At many times I felt like I was watching a horror picture, moreso at the beginning. I was scared for the victims and felt their terror. The soundtrack was really good. I would call it more of a score. It was perfectly unique just like the film itself. I now like Beethoveen or Ludwig Van way more than I ever thought I would. Every piece is perfect for each particular scene. I also liked Alex's rendition of 'Singing In The Rain'. He wasn't too bad. The film includes it's own language, Nadsat, which I found amusing at times and confusing at others. The first moment that I stopped hating Alex and started caring about his character was the scene in which he was released from prison and went home to find his belongings and room taken. I felt bad because he had gone through so much and went home where he thought he was loved to find nothing for him. He had to start all over. He should have thought about the consequences before he did his actions. What I loved about the film the most is how no matter how hard he tries to change he always has that evil inside him. He is 'A Clockwork Orange'. Make sure not to miss out on this fantastic classic that Stanley Kubrick did brilliantly.",7,0,1,3 February 2005
