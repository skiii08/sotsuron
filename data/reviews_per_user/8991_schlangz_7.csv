Creed II," Nansy Pansy clone of Rocky 4
","I have yet to see a decent 2018's movie.Creed 2 is another huge disappointment, boring af and not even one (!) good fighting scene. I liked the first movie a lot so this annoys me even more... I kept playing with my mobile because I couldn't bear the crappy story which is basically a poor rip off of Rocky 4.And here it comes: the final fight the 'bad guy' throws the towel (after the 'evil russians' leave the scene) to end the fight I mean WTF this is Rocky after all are you kidding me??If you are looking for nansy pansy Rocky have fun with it, all grown ups should watch Rocky 4 instead.",2,0,1,20 March 2019
Blade Runner," I may have seen a different movie
","Because this was the most boring movie I have seen in years, if not ever. A simple waste of time. Where does all the hype come from? Best sci-fi movie ever? Milestone? Seriously people what's wrong with you? Nothing happems, no development, just non stop boring. Oh wait: young Harrison Ford eating noodles, a snake and some 80's boobies are worth mentioning.I will watch the sequel tomorrow hopefully I won't regret it...",1,25,48,14 January 2018
Annihilation," Stupidity beyond Scary Movie
","If you thought the lady Ghostbusters movie was horrible, check out this one. The other reviews already greatly describe all the absurdities so I won't do it again. The final scene could have rescued the entite movie, but even that turned out dumb af.Don't waste your time!!!!",1,3,9,27 February 2019
