Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat: Not Boring At All...
","BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF America FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTANDirector: Larry Charles Writer: Sacha Baron Cohen, Peter Baynham, Anthony Hines, Todd Phillips, Dan Mazer'Although Kazakhstan a glorious country, it have a problem, too: economic, social, and Jew.'Sacha Baron Cohen, the man we all know and recognize as the simple-minded yet intense Ali G, is treading water. He's not going anywhere, and doesn't seem to be gasping for breath either. Maybe it's nothing new, and Tom Green may be owed some dues, but he's still freakishly good at getting the laughing stock award of the year. Jackass? Johnny Knoxville? Make room for Borat, because if you don't, he may make sexy time with you without you even being aware.As an actual, living, breathing, walking around type of person, Sacha Baron Cohen is probably sure to surprise you as evidenced in his out of character interviews. He graduated from Cambridge University with a degree in history before entering the world of comedic performance. His show 'Da Ali G Show' on HBO was a cult hit in post 9/11 America, where he imitates a hip hop style interviewer in an effort to intimidate experts in many social and political fields. His Hebrew is pretty good too, despite what the film Borat would lead you to believe about his opinions.The film Borat is the story of a young ambassador from an Eastern European country in the United States. It follows his path along from New York City to Hollywood, and all the pitfalls along the way. It is an extremely edgy mockumentary that hearkens comparisons to many films of coming to age in America, but without the sappy side stories, excluding Borat's obsession with Pamela Anderson which fuels his journey across the country, by way of a Baywatch magazine and eventually as an unwitting saboteur in the form of a DVD. It is a story that makes little sense, but brings attention to many stereotypes we take so easily for granted when living here in the U.S.A.'What's up with it, Vanilla face? Me and my homie Azamat just parked our slab outside. We're looking for somewhere to post up our Black asses for the night. So, uh, bang bang, skeet skeet, nigga. Just a couple of pimps, no hos.'Borat and his manager of sorts, a chicken, and a bear are all that we get for main characters. But the amount of laughs more than make up for any shortcomings that one might foresee. Much of the humor is very dry yet jolting. You will probably actually find yourself wondering how a man could be so under cultured, and totally lose track of the fact that this is indeed a comedic character portrayal, and not a real human being sent from Kazakhstan to learn the ways of American life.The best scenes are back-to-back, and the wheels keep rolling, even while our eyes are. His inept fear of Jews and Gypsies alike, are fairly unsettling, but his reactions are so outrageous that we can almost overlook the prejudice inherent in much of his 'foriegn' viewpoints. My personal favorite scene is towards the end at a Church where Borat finds himself stumbling in to be redeemed and saved by an overzealous evangelist. But everyone will more than likely have their own moments of complete comedic satisfaction while being entertained by this film.The acting by Cohen is phenomenal, as stated before we can easily subdue our objective view and find ourselves as lost as he is in not only the plot but dialog of the film. The dialog is undoubtedly the stronger point of the picture, even amidst the tom-foolery of an overgrown man with a child's heart.Borat actually caught a big bit of flak from the actual government of Kazakhstan when he toured the States for interviews in character as Borat. On the white house lawn, Cohen threw an impromptu press conference touting the downfalls of the Kazakhstan government, which they retaliated to with a spread in The New York Times that intended to shoot down statements made by Sacha. However, despite these factors Borat managed to break records at the box-office.Consider yourself lucky to be part of a time when mockumentary film making is at such a high standard of success. Borat is definitely one of the more refined and professional attempts in the genre, and an unmissable contribution to comedy.'May George Bush drink the blood of every man, woman, and child in Iraq!'Actors: Sacha Baron Cohen, Ken Davitian, LuenellProducer: Monica Levinson, Dan Mazer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jay Roach Cinematographer: Luke Geissbuhler, Anthony Hardwick Music: Erran Baron Cohen Editor: Craig Alpert, Peter Teschner, James ThomasBorat (2006) 10/10",10,1,11,26 January 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," The 40 Year Old Virgin
","40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN 'Really? All your girlfriends wanted to have sex with virgins too? That's funny... I didn't even know you g-girls talked like that. I think my first time might be your best time too. Well I knew it, you know what? I knew that you'd react that way and I knew that you would want to lead me through my first sexual encounter will all the compassion and care that someone would give to their soul-mate.' There are so many films about romance. Too many. With titles floating around every year that just make the mark harder to reach for the next batch, where will we be in 15 years? Hopefully, some of the better writer's will always find the new humor, without resorting to current trendiness and eventually retread on the field of romantic film. Romeo and Juliet deserves a better remake? Bah, let the kids take it as they got it, I say. No need to follow the script to a 't', anymore. Too much is on the line with American media for it to admit it, but romantic comedies are so easy that it's actually harder to get attention at the box office.The 90's were a prime example of the 'way too much of a good thing' theory. We all need that moment in the theater with a spouse or loved one around one arm, with one in a popcorn bucket. The balance is good. But the quantity of these movies released seems a bit brash. The point is, since 'There's Something About Mary', we've all been waiting for the next troupe of filmmakers to fill the Fareley Brothers shoes.'You know what my problem is? I am not interesting. What am I supposed to say I went to magic camp? That I'm an accomplished ventriloquist? Oh, I am the 7th degree imperial yo-yo master.' No wonder, then, that it took a mockumentary specialist of the likes of Steve Carell to bring the life back to the perpetual stream of love-shmuckery in modern cinema. Carell, fresh of his stint on 'The Daily Show', co-wrote '40 Year Old Virgin' with 'Anchorman' director, Judd Apatow (which Steve also starred in.) Carell, himself has a charisma that allows first name approach to even the most unacquainted viewer. Shortly after '40 Year Old', Carell went on to command the reigns of popular TV show 'The Office', playing in a similar business-type setting as the one in 'Virgin.' It is also probably of no surprise that the film 'Virgin' contains some of it's most brilliant mockeries of culture in segments that totally exclude opposite gender reactionary stunts. For example, the poker scene near the beginning of the film should be listed, in my personal opinion, as one of the most funny scenes in film-making history. In it, we see five well-ab-led men in their middle ages (late 20's to late 30's) make total asses of themselves for each other around a table of gambles. As the Arabic fellow leaves the scene, we get a real taste of how down-right grungy the characters will be in the movie. How fitting, once again, that a film of such improportionate standards takes on cultural symbology and does a total script-flip on the idea of stereotypes, right? It doesn't do much good to really explore the depths of the film, without viewing it for yourself. '40 Year Old Virgin', is certainly one of those few movies that you need to be there to get the humor. Yet, nonetheless, the film remains attractive and utmost hilarious during just about every segment that it rustles out of it's pockets like a forlorn drunk scrambling to pay up his tab after an unsuccessful night at the bar.The lengths that the actors went to for the sake of comedy are, as such, mostly unscripted and spontaneously set up to explode on impact. Steve Carell even went in for a real chest hair removal job without special effects, for the film. Now where else are you going to get that realness? Objectively, the film demands attention. Subjectively? forget it. I just hope guys who go and see this flick have already gotten their share of play with the female gender. Feelings will get hurt, quite easily, otherwise.'Do you ever notice how... like, in a relationship... one person's always like 'blah blah blah blah' and the other person's like 'What are you talking about?' and one person's like 'blah blah blalablah...'' 10/10",10,1,4,24 December 2006
Pi," Pi
","'When I was a little kid, my mother told me not to stare into the sun, so when I was six I didÂ…'So what 'A Beautiful Mind' got Academy Awards? I don't trust collegiate societies anyway. Besides, even if it WAS based on a true story, Russel Crowe will never get my vote for acting. His method acting style really, really gives me the creeps. Well, then, where might my curiosity of the mathematics and sciences lead me? What's interesting about arduous code-breaking anyway? It must be Arronofsky's fault that I'm asking so many questions. I have a theory that if you receive an answer, it's kind of like potato chips, you can't stop grabbing for more. Speaking of chips, I'm still confused about his first movie. Either the ming mecca chip was responsible for the atrocities of man, or Max Cohen. Reminding me of the age-old question, what came first; the chicken or the egg?Questions may seem arbitrary if you don't truly receive any tangible answers. But that doesn't stop physicists from quantifying electrons! And it definitely shouldn't stop your enjoyment of 'Pi'. From beginning to end. But the scratchy camera-work and ear-popping soundtrack may scare off the newbies, teenyboppers, and elderly. Well, I personally won't be missing them that much. I like my art the way I like sex, hard to get most of the time, and usually fulfilling for only half of us.If rumors are true, this may be your one chance in cinema history to watch a real live brain be penetrated by a pencil tip. But, goodness gracious, that's not saying much after you see the finale! I have to say, there's been a lot more surprising endings to movies that I've seen, but I'm hard-pressed to think of one more appropriate.'Eureka, I have found it!'In all seriousness, 'The Blair Witch Project' really did what no other film had done. Made millions with thousands. 'Pi' was, too, on a shoestring budget. The similarities don't stop there. As mentioned before, the camera-work is really nerve-wracking. It's scary, and there are very few namebrand actors in the film. By the way, Marcy Dawson, the stock market recruiter, would be my own personal definition of witch. Not to be misleading, however, while the former had us lost deep in the woodsÂ… This movie is just DEEP.Based on a concept that many major thinkers have always suspected and strived to decipher, 'Pi' is not afraid to break boundaries of any type. The idea is repeated many, many times through the film, in the exact same consecutive phrases leading to the conclusion that there is a certain code in nature that if broken would lead to enlightenment. Well, alright, I take back what I said earlier about redundancy in code-breaking. Kind of. You see, Max Cohen is trying to find the big one. But he's not the only one. Count the badguys in this film and you'll be left wondering why he even bothers. You'd think that the answer to life itself would be more readily shared with the public in today's age of mass communication. On the contrary, we find that greed does indeed outdo a do-gooder.Hidden deeper, though, the truth that Max Cohen may actually be the wrong guy to try is inevitable. After all, we had dudes in the past who claimed enlightenment. One was hung to death, one disappeared in a forest, and one, well, reportedly 'prayer-dueled' himself to death. Look at the number of digits he seems to be so attached to. 216 = 6x6x_ . I'll let you fill in the blank. Use a calculator if you have to, I won't consider it cheating.Despite the scratchiness, the camera lens never seems to do anything unnecessary. In fact, this may be the beginning of a new age of film-making and we never even knew it. Matthew Libatique and Darren Arronofsky (who also wrote the of course ingenious script) are claimed to have invented the technique of the 'hip hop montage' in cinema. In which the score (brilliantly executed by Clint Mansell) guides the viewer through a series of moving frames. The acting is superb on every count. Even the little girl next door seems to take on some sort of magic, emphasized by her last question to Max as he descends down the stairwell of the project building they share together. 748 divided by 238. Well, it's close, at least.Hands down one of the most thought-provoking films of all time, 'Pi' deserved every Oscar nomination that 'A Beautiful Mind' gained later. But it's okay, Russel Crowe may have stolen the University, but Sean Guillette still holds the Universe.Something's going on. It has to do with that number. There's an answer in that number.'Pi' (1998) 10/10",10,1,4,4 August 2005
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," An Accident
","''A thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing.''That the second viewing of this feature has the same effect as the first is a statement that deserves review. I did, admittedly, miss the second-to-last scene while outside the theater on a cigarette break. That's where the continuity of the film really shined, for me, personally. The climax, then lost, recovered on second viewing, itself did not change the pace of the film, however committed the final snare to the drum rolls therein. The first thing I noticed on screen was the Confederate Flag, obscured by various clutter of the lead character's fitting room. Then, the floating actor's turned back, in meditation.'He was never around.'The piece flows like a jazz note and floats it's plot onward, like a riverboat approaching a dam & lock. Quietly navigating through dialog that hovers above the cinematography like an increased loudness, a bass, to the treble of the thoughts within the audience.'Destroy your play.'The problem was the sensitivity of the actors, especially the leads. They were working on stage, on camera, and inspired by all of the traditions of modern artistic entertainment. You can see it in their eyes as they read the lines without microphones, speaking to a crowd as shocked as we are, the movie-goers, to witness the incredible voyeurism.'It was an accident.'10/10",10,2,16,18 January 2015
Straight Outta Compton," Terrible, but Perfect
","This movie had gotten a lot of hyping up by people and advertisements, to me, so when I saw it, I already knew that I was supposed to be in love with it. However, sadly, I will say that it is stupidly exaggerated in most aspects of the realistic portrayal of a real life music industry giant that has gone on to now self- produce it's own movies and music videos in the capacity that the genre has begun recycling so many ideas, and still coming up with new ways to spin the story. I think that the best thing about this movie, is that it is the definitive story of the plot behind many sub-culture hip hop movies. To say that it had been anticipated would be necessary then, for the true understanding of a sub- culture, itself. It seems redundant, and misinformed with guidance and any methodology to ethics, in many ways, too, and glorifies violence in the same way as it's predecessors, but in the innovative true story element, and a big enough budget, it is truly quite spectacular of a movie watching event, for the very same reasons that you would dismiss it as being over the top or uninspired. Straight Outta Compton (2015) is a 10 out of 10, movie, whether you would like it to be, or not.",10,3,28,14 November 2015
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Nightmare On Elm Street
","A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984)'I'm gonna kill you slowÂ…'In the event of my death, please cease all life support systems that may be even biologically or genetically in place.Why?'ThisÂ… Is God!'I was young when I first saw Freddy in a dream, probably in my early teenage years. He was sitting in a greenish-yellow hued, dark room with nothing aside from a disappearing window that bleakly shown the light of a black moon through a white sky.Have I gone crazy since the night of that particular dream? Definitely.Have I recovered and became readjusted to the side of dreams that are more lucid and easier to mentally digest? Yes and no. It was in reality one of many nightmares that I had in my youth that I could not control, so it will always be my self-employed job to control myself during sleep.Am I still concerned that the dream may reoccur? Indefinitely. A quote, not from the original Nightmare on Elm Street, that I'll use here, is the one sentence spoke by the monster of my own unconscious creation, after a long night of staring dreadfully at the shrouded face of Freddy Kreuger. At the end of the dream he merely said this before hopping out the window.'I'll be back'A year before I was born, the masterwork of infamous director Wes Craven was released worldwide. It was unquestionably the most original work of horror in history.'Â… Count myself a king of infinite spaceÂ…'The lucidity of the dreamer's is questionable. Is Freddy in charge of the dreams, or is he merely an invasive force that beckons them deeper into lucidity? It becomes apparent that the fearlessness of the heroes is partially an effect of the dreams, as we become acquainted with the characters whose fears of sleep become dangerously unhealthy. It's only when they fall asleep that their irrefutable anxiety becomes pure angst that lashes out at the filmviewer's conscience.Scream 'Stop!' Scream 'Don't go down the stairs!' 'Don't fall asleep!'But they will. They are superheroes within the dreams that they are victims of having.This brings to mind all of the intricacies of dreaming and the completely repellent hoax of rapid eye movement. The mind's eye is working, in our dreams, this is for sureÂ… The eyelids which quiver beneath the pillow's lulling are more likely merely a lullaby to the soul.I have never seen a movie that has been more overlooked as well as underlooked in it's effect on popular culture. Either your looking at it as the greatest film of all time, for the wrong reasonsÂ… Or your looking at it as another campy 80's concept flickÂ… For again, the wrong reasons.In truth, this is one of the top ten films of all time. It preys on self-esteems of everyone that can watch it from beginning to end in one sitting. I watched it myself, for about the fifth time before writing this review. I was still jumping out of the chair at certain points. I am not someone who scares easily, especially from movies.So why is a movie that is so difficult to understand worthy of such praise? It's not how you watch it, why you watch it, where or when, or even whoÂ… watches it. It's what your watching. It's the same every time, and it will always be funny, as well as scary. But I've heard that laughter is the sincerest form of insanity known to exist within the physical spectrum of emotion.Fear the night, but if you doÂ… Don't forget who's watching behind the other sides of your eyes.Goodnight, folksÂ… til next timeÂ…'Whatever you doÂ… Don't fall asleep'By the wayÂ… his glove is missing from the face of the planet. Wonder if I still got it? I definitely have the hat to matchÂ…A Nightmare On Elm Street 10/10",10,0,2,15 October 2008
