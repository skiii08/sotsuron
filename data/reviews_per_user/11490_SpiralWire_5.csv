The Sound of Music," Oh woe
","I may not be the world's most exuberant man. My general attitude toward life is one of negativity and hatred. That said, I fail to see how even the most syrupy of happy types (the kind of people who sing on their way to camping holidays) can't see that this film is pure wrongness in many, many respects.The Von Trapp children are the most annoying creatures ever created. Whatever spawned them simply must be tracked down and eliminated. Why are they so happy? Why don't they mind all the ridiculous singing coming from that absurd woman? Why do they join in?Seriously, it may be crowd-pleasing, but I just don't like the attitude it's conveying.",2,13,37,4 April 2005
Ocean's Twelve," Needlessly complex - a highly irritating sequel
","What staggers me most about this film is that it was made by the same people who produced the fantastic Oceans Eleven three years previously. Where Ocean's Eleven was a film with a significant target (the money in the safe), and all the action and drama was leading toward that goal, its sequel is disjointed, aimless and highly confusing.I defy anyone to tell me on the outset of the film what the thieves are going to steal. First it's one thing, then another, but it isn't really, and then it is. But as it turns out, it was something else, then it wasn't, then it was. Ad infinitum. I can't accurately describe the details because they were simply too muddled and poorly explained.Another fault is the use of the characters. Where in Eleven there was a coherency in what each member of the team had to do, in Twelve we are shown a billion different plot strands that confuse their roles in the heist and even hide some members away for no real reason (Bernie Mac is put in jail a quarter of the way through and not seen again until the end. In essence, there are many pitfalls on their way that separate them all from each other. And that shouldn't happen, because the whole idea should be Twelve thieves working as a team - rather than some trying to complete one objective, and others getting on with something completely different. Or am I wrong?Lastly, I found it highly annoying how many little plot strands were being introduced and never fully explained or concluded, and this served simply to make the movie quite unappealing. I just want to know why, when writing this film, they thought it would be cool to disjoint and confuse everything to a maximum degree.Ultimately, confusing, aimless and not a patch on the original.",3,1,2,2 April 2005
Schindler's List," Beautifully conveyed
","Schindler's list is truly a excellent movie, not simply the way in which it is shot, but also the way it conveys exactly what it meant for one man to save a few lives. Oskar Schindler, a Nazi industrialist, employs Jews and ultimately negotiates for their diversion from Auschwitz and into his factory. On the outset we are given the impression that he is merely a businessman, regarding the Jews as nothing more than money-making tools. But we are able to slowly learn that it is only by giving this cold-hearted impression to the Nazi officers he barters with that he could be successful - to simply fight the cause of the Jews would probably have seen him hanged. No, Schindler is cleverer than that, and manages to save the lives of over one thousand doomed Jews; men, women and children. His humanity slowly emerges throughout the film, sometimes in palpable acts of kindness such as insisting that the trains carrying Jews on a hot day are hosed with cooling water.In stark contrast, the Nazi commandant in charge of the labour camp, Amon Goeth (Ralph Feinnes), is a psychotic killer whose methods of operation run to arbitrary killings and a total hatred of the Jew race. It is he who Schindler must befriend and gain trust from in order to save as many people as possible. The film avoids simply documenting a piece of history that we have heard before. By focusing on a handful of personal experiences, an emotional anchor is provided for the audience with which we can go much deeper into the meaning of what is happening. The atrocities carried out principally by Amon Goeth and by other Nazi officers, which involve harrowing scenes of fear and suffering are integrated with the importance of recognising how important each individual person is. Whilst we see Goeth taking pot-shots at working Jews in the morning from his balcony, and thus demonstrating his total indifference to Jewish lives, we are shown Schindler, who at the end, weeps for every single life he couldn't save. This is manifested superbly by him looking at his gold pin badge: it would have bought him one more person to be saved.And so we learn that Schindler's acts were not about numbers, since as his Jewish assistant reassures him, saving one life is saving everyone.",9,9,13,4 June 2005
Once Upon a Time in America," Good, but not the one
","It is difficult to rate this film since parts of it deserve a nine and others a rather sad four.The film begins quietly, violently and engagingly with De Niro's character, Noodles, taking time out in an opium lounge while heavies are on the search for him. This introductory chapter is a promising piece of cinema with some quite masterfully edited sequences. Aesthetically too, it is masterful and detailed. We are eventually taken on a nostalgic journey back to Noodles' childhood where we are shown the blossoming friendships and criminality that would become his life. All very nice, all very romantic and visually brilliant. At these early stages in the film, you can see yourself really settling to watching a magnificent epic. But as the film goes on, one can begin to see why this has not become the hardened classic that The Godfather or Goodfellas has. Put simply, there is too much sexuality. From the awkward, fumbling teenager to the grown-up, amoral rapist that Noodles is shown to be, the theme of sexual desire dominates the main body of the film. Indeed, you're never more than fifteen minutes away from a scene where someone is being touched-up, ravaged or slobbered over. Of course, there is nothing wrong with displaying such issues in film, but surely not with such determined frequency as to make it just plain seedy? The harm that does to the film is two-fold. Firstly it distracts from what could be a beautiful and engaging piece of cinema and secondly it alienates the audience by having no sympathetic character. The Noodles of the 1960s, who we are to follow through the film, is really just an overly-nostalgic, nasty old sex offender.",5,8,18,29 October 2006
The Godfather," Drab and awful?
","Derirative, contrived, moronic in parts, inexcusably slapstick, horrendously acted, monstrously ill-informed, soul-wastingly aimless, incompetantly structured, amazingly awful dialogue, virulently hideous casting, monstrous over use of toilet humour, inescapably stupid bodily function gags, insanely complicated plot, innumerable plot-holes, a myriad of anachronisms, baffling directorial ineptitude, spectacularly pretentious and alienating, superbly bad costumes, terrible make-up, manically dire soundtrack... ...are all NOT faults of this quite splendid gangster epic. Liked it quite a lot.",8,1,2,4 April 2005
