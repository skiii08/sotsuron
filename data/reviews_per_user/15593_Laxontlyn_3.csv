The Avengers," Not setting new high standards, just being good.
","Judging from this movie reception we could easily conclude that this is one of the best comic-book movies ever! But, truth be told, it is a pretty generic movie. It has all the favorite clichés: 'the evil' that will destroy the world, we have typical jerk->hero transformation (with pseudo sacrifice) and all the others 'unpredictable' character evolutions... I would call it a well-crafted movie. Action-scenes are good, dialog can be fun sometimes and the acting is nice. It just brings nothing new to the table and it is one of those movies, that you will watch and then remember a couple of scenes/lines from it and later on, you'll just remember a warm fuzzy feeling that it left in you. So it is worth to check it out.Final verdict - it is not groundbreaking, but it is an entertaining movie, so check it out.",6,4,9,2 February 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A video game cutscene.
","I've read the book 'Hobbit', but I am not going to judge this movie based on it. I am looking on it as a stand-alone title.I enjoyed the first movie of the 'Hobbit' series, but this one feels like they took the archetype of an action movie and merge it with fantasy environments and characters and here we are. Actually it hits almost all of the action movie clichÃ©s: 1. Over the top action - check. (Ammount of action was so damn HIGH) 2.Villain who talks a lot but does nothing - check. 3. Villain 'Minions' are dealt without even sweating - check. 4. Love story out of nowhere - check. (Strange that sex was absent, yet) 5. Logical issues with world where movie takes place. 6. Invulnerable main characters - check. 7. No AMMO limits - check. 8. Perfect aim, agility and placement - check. 9. No signs of exhaustion - check. 10. Always ignorant, in the face of danger, authority - check. ...You know what, I love action movies so i don't want them to be compared to this, so I think this movie is best summed up in the title of my review, it is a video game cutscene after you beat the level. Next level is loading... I hope it won't be as dull.",5,9,13,2 February 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," As usual.
","You know that feeling, when you for example taste a good quality product and it for sure should be awesome, but it lacks something. That is precisely how I feel about this movie. You have awesome effects, great camera angles and from time to time a joke that can get a chuckle or two. Although, this humor is not my cup of tee, but I can understand why people can get behind it. But there is an inconsistent world, shallow villain, undeveloped characters, plot full of Clichés, etc. So why do I even bother? It is after all, a movie for a younger audience so one should not expect a masterly portrayed characters and thought-provoking plot. The thing is, that the overwhelming majority of todays cinema is consumed by this kind of filmmaking. But again, this is easily understandable. People want to run from the real world into fake one, where rules does not apply and everything turns good at the end. Have we become mentally weak, that we can't handle the movie that is more serious than a cartoon? The audience won't ever visit the cinemas after they shed a tear there or had themselves pondering over movie they just saw? Than again, it is a comic book movie and it does the job. It just feels that every movie today is some sort of a comic book movie.",5,32,67,7 August 2014
