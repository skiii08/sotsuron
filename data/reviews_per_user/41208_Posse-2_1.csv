The Blair Witch Project," Scooby Doo Episodes More Scary!
","'Scariest Movie Since The Exorcist' ... maybe for some.  But for us (we're brother and sister), watching Scooby Doo episodes can be more scary!Without a doubt, The Blair Witch Project received way too much hype and it just didn't deliver.  We basically found it a waste of our eight dollars and we wouldn't even bother to rent it when it comes out (why waste another two dollars?).Overall, the downfall of the movie was that it lacked the whole 'scary atmosphere'.  Sure, you might have to use your imagination ... but it's kind of hard when you are staring blankly at the giant screen, totally bored.A big thing about this movie is that 'it's scary because of what you can't see rather than what you can'.  That would be just fine and dandy ... except the movie certainly doesn't live up to that expectation.  The ending of the film was not bad, but it sure as heck didn't make up for the hour and fifteen minutes that preceeded it.Frankly, the opening sequence for The Blair Witch Project's website is scarier than the entire film ... and that sure isn't a compliment!",1,5,12,12 August 1999
