The Avengers," Predictable
","A couple of chuckles from the one liners, action scenes that went on too long, and a predictable and inevitable ending. It was okay and easy watching to pass a Friday evening, just don't expect too much from it - challenging and a fine work of art it isn't, a bit of fun it is. Hiddleston made a fine villain and the other characters performed as expected,i.e. not everyone is going to get an Oscar for best actor no matter how many films they make, some of the hook and line dialogue was spoken as if they were bored, perhaps they were. CGI is, well CGI. They worst aspect of this film though is the title, if you were expecting Steed and Emma Peel, or Purdey and Gambit then you are going to be very disappointed.",5,3,5,13 May 2016
Jackie," Slow, boring and a story not worthy of a film
","I had mixed thoughts about watching this film fearing that there would not be a story to be told, and my concerns were well founded. Yes it was an event that shocked the world, I can't imagine what it must have been like for Jackie Kennedy to experience the death of her husband in that way, so close up and brutally (although she is far from unique in having such an experience), but the film neither captured the horror of if, didn't explore the grief in a way that involved me as the viewer, and in the end had very little to say. Not a disaster but equally not worthy of the high scores that some reviews have given in. The performances were adequate without being outstanding, and perhaps a different style of directing might have made it more watchable and engaging, but in the end I was just bored by it all.",5,0,0,29 July 2019
Furious 7," How does this rate an average of 7.4?
","Essentially dire. Terrible script, no story line, and laughable action scenes, e.g. police stations built completely out of brittle glass, or massive street destroying explosions from small packages. Hopeless. My wife and I were so gripped by this film that I'm on the computer writing this review and she is using her smartphone.You can cant live this time again, don't waste it watching this.",4,0,0,13 October 2017
