The Sound of Music," new perspective
","Possible Spoilers This has been my favorite movie for, gosh, about 10 years now.  (Considering I'm 19 going on 20, that's an accomplishment.)  I always thought it was great-it made me fall in love with Julie Andrews' talents and taught me about chemistry between romantic leads.  ('Mommy, the Baroness and the Captain don't GO together-he goes better with Maria.')  My roommate was in the chorus of the play at her hometown civic theater over the summer, and we watched the video of one of her performances.  Their play, taken almost directly from the original Broadway version, was obviously different than the film, including a few different songs and a totally different way of Maria and George falling in love.  Seeing the play, aside from giving me new ways to lovingly torture my roommie ('1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3 step together! now step-hop...'), has only made me appreciate the movie even more.  I never gave Ernest Lehman, the film's screenwriter, enough credit.  The play dialogue really wasn't that good-VERY schmaltzy (if you think the movie's bad, you haven't heard anything yet).  The love scene came across very differently-not as playful or subtle as the movie.  It just wasn't as good, let's just put it that way.  The movie has great actors and a fantastic writer doing what they do best, and though the score helps, I now see that a great score doesn't a great musical make.  That and the scenary-thank you to whoever made that cast and crew go to Austria-brilliant move on your part. This movie will remain my favorite, and my mother's, for years to come.",10,1,7,28 August 2003
The Sound of Music," Simply wonderful
","I vividly remember going to the mall with my dad when I was about 7, shopping for my mom's birthday present.  When my dad came across the 25th-anniversary edition video of The Sound of Music, he knew it was the perfect gift.  I was less sure, until she opened the present and was incredibly stunned and happy.  However, it didn't get watched until about two years later, when I was 10 and wanted to watch a movie one night.  Mom suggested Sound of Music, and she began singing along with Julie Andrews right off the bat.  Her friend came over that night, took one look at the screen, and burst into 'How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?', which was playing at the moment.  Right then, I knew I was watching something unique, something wonderful.  By the end of the movie, I knew I was right.I've now seen The Sound of Music over 35 times and know it ver batum, dialogue and lyrics.  This movie is the ultimate feel-good film-a delightful story that provides a great escape from the drudgery of real life.  The love story is so very sweet, and you're hard-pressed to find a scene that is more heart-warming than the dance Maria shares with the Captain.  Yes, I'm a hopeless romantic, so I tend to like things like this anyway, but this film is different.  It deals with romance, yes, but also the love of siblings and parents, the love for one's country, and the love of God all at once.  I recommend it extremely highly for anyone, anytime.",10,1,7,17 October 2002
Casablanca," perfect
","Casablanca is the closest thing to a perfect movie that has ever been made. It's the perfect length to tell its story but not drag, and it has suspense, humor, drama, romance, music, and everything else you would want in a movie. Screw the AFI-Casablanca is the single best movie ever to come out of Hollywood and I doubt it will ever be topped.",Null,1,1,10 April 2003
The Notebook," not since 'Titanic'...
","...have I seen or heard so many people bawl in the last 20 minutes of a movie.  When the credits rolled for this movie, all that was heard over the soft music was sniffling, including my own.  This movie is certainly a tearjerker, mostly due to the performances of James Garner and Gena Rowlands.  If the film were just about young Noah and Allie falling in love, it would seem ho-hum and contrived.  It's not, though.  It doesn't end with them finally getting together.***SPOILERS HEREIN*** Instead, like the book on which it is based, it ends with a very poignant look at Noah and Allie forty-some years later, when they are both elderly and ill.  The pain that Garner's character feels over his 'sweetheart's' Alzheimer's is apparent without being hurled at us.  We watch him watching her deteriorate, which is hard to do, but you can't stop watching it because he is so in love with her that it is compelling while at the same time tragic.  The book ends very differently than the movie, and doesn't give away who Allie chose until the very end, when you realize that the older couple and the younger couple are the same.  Still, the ending of the film, while different than the book, is very powerful and is a slightly fantasized version of how strong the bond between spouses can be.  Who cares if this sort of thing doesn't happen often, if at all, in real life?  When Rowlands looks out at a sunset and says 'I've never seen anything more beautiful' and Garner, looking at her, says 'Neither have I,' don't we all long for someone to feel that way about us?  The film has its funny points too, especially between the younger couple ('Woman, you kill me!'), which breaks up the tears nicely.  This is a good thing, or else I doubt I would have made it through this one.  Good performances and writing all around-great movie for couples in all stages of love.",Null,0,0,24 July 2004
Love Actually," truly uplifting
","I've dubbed this movie 'Love Actually, Or How Far We Can Stretch Emilie's Heartstrings in 2 Hours' for a reason-it's amazing!!!!  The three climaxes at the end of the movie, where the three main plotlines come to a resolution, are all an emotional roller-coaster ride.  I can't say enough good things about this movie.  Yes, it has some flaws, yes, I think it has a few too many f-words and nude scenes, but as I tell people, you forget about all that and just get so caught up in the sweeping stories.  The music is brilliantly used, especially at the very beginning and the very end, to weave the stories together.  I'm 'high' for days after seeing this movie that's so full of wit, charm, and Capra-style belief in triumph of the good things in life,namely love.",10,0,3,3 April 2004
Mr. Holland's Opus," sniff sniff
","This is my favorite movie, and also my mom's.  Whenever I watch it, I'm so inspired to play the piano and flute, and I noticably improve on both. It's a tear-jerker, but not in the way that makes you embarrassed for crying. I love this movie, and my view of my own music would be profoundly different if it had not been made.  Thanks be to God that it was.",Null,2,4,18 February 2003
