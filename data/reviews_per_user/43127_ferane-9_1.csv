Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars? More like computer-animated Toy Wars.
","Just like most people I had somewhat high hopes that I would get to see the beginning of the great saga that is Star Wars. I got to see Star Wars, yes, but that was about 20-30% of the movie. When I say Star Wars I mean great scenery, 'the force', catching dialog, spectacular sword fights and huge space battles. So, o.k., I got to see the beginning of a great saga for about a third of the time, but the rest... The rest of the movie... JarJar... big fish, bigger fish, biggest fish, duh... pod racing, computer-animated robots, space ships, cities and planets... Toy Wars. I'm must give some credit to the computer-animated parts, for some of them where really good, i.e. It was sometimes very hard to tell the difference between computer-animated and reality. As i final note I can say that I respect that it's Lucas' story, and he can do whatever he wants with it, but please, Star Wars is a grown-up story. Please let it remain that way.",6,0,1,27 March 2001
