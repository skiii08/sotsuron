Lucky Number Slevin," What a load of crap...
","Here is another example of a film that has been given undeservedly high ratings.Sure, the plot may be intriguing but that doesn't make up for the disgusting style.This action film style displaying exaggeratedly violent scenes over and over is a load of perverted crap, made up by what to me seems to be an insane mind, and probably one of the reasons this world is turning steadily more violent and cold.What makes people want to frolic in this, what's wrong with people? I guess that's a wasted rhetoric question here as I see most people actually like this garbage and most likely do not even know there is something wrong deep inside.But to like this crap really says it all, doesn't it? It's for empty soulless people, with empty soulless lives.",1,8,25,7 May 2008
