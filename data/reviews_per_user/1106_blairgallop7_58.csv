National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Book of secrets strikes gold
","The sequel to National Treasure,this movie National Treasure:Book of Secrets was just as good if not better than the original.Nicolas Cage returns as Benjamin Gates as well as returnees in the franchise which include Jon Voight as Patrick Gates,Justin Bartha as Riley Poole,Diane Kruger as Abigail Chase but also features new cast members such as Helen Mirren,Harvey Keitel and Ed Harris.It's genre is Action/Adventure but features it's fair share of funny moments and well as being suspenseful as the original was.The plot of the film was better than the first National Treasure and it was so good,that in my view, a sequel should be made to continue the storyline.Bravo!",10,1,4,31 December 2007
Scarface," One of the best films of the 80's as well as a classic
","One of the best films of the 80's as well as one of the best gangster films ever made,Scarface delivers a bit of action mixed with some drama,romance and abit of thrilling moments.Al Pacino stars as Tony Montana who is a Cuban refugee-gangster and one of the most vicious gangsters ever portrayed in a film.Besides Al Pacino,the film also boats a great supporting cast including Steven Bauer as Tony's best friend Manny Ribera,Robert Loggia as Frank Lopez who is Tony's boss,Michelle Pfeiffer as Elvira Hancock who is Lopez's mistress,Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Gina who is Tony's younger sister and even a small appearance by F.Murray Abraham as Omar Suarez who is a henchman.Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone,I am surprised this film wasn't nominated for a few Academy Awards such as Best Actor-Al Pacino or Best Supporting Actor-Steven Bauer who were both nominated for Golden Globes but didn't win.Definitely a film to watch if you are a fan of any of the cast members and one of Al Pacino's best films.",10,1,2,24 April 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," The Wrong Man is the Right Movie
","Lucky Number Slevin(released as the Wrong Man in Australia) is a brainteaser of a crime-thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end about what is going on from the start.It is about a guy by the name of Slevin Kelevra(played brilliantly by Josh Hartnett) who gets confused with a loser gambler by the name of Nick Fisher.Because of this mistaken identity crisis,Slevin is immediately found in a long standing feud between two crime lords known as The Rabbi(Ben Kingsley) and The Boss(Morgan Freeman).Slevin also has to deal with the likes of Detective Brikowski(Stanley Tucci)who is trying to put all the pieces together,Mr.Goodkat/Smith(played by Bruce Willis)who is also involved in all of this and Lindsay(Lucy Liu)who is also trying to figure what is going on as she is an amateur detective/mortician and she usually gets the dead bodies to investigate in which Brikowski sometimes overlooks her duties.But it was a great film nonetheless as it makes references to other films,etc.",10,8,10,25 August 2007
The Hangover," A Hangover worth remembering
","After watching this film, I thought it was one of the best comedies of not just 2009 but of the entire decade( the 2000's). The Hangover is about four friends,Phil Wenneck,Stu Price, Alan Garner and Doug Billings(Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha respectively) who travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party but end up staying longer as they wake up the morning after not remembering much. The reason why I found this to be one of the funniest films of the decade as well as one of my favorite comedies is because of the film's plot, the main actors in the film(listed above) as well as some of the supporting actors(namely Ken Jeong and Heather Graham) and one or two of the cameos. Overall,it is an hilarious ride from start to finish.",10,2,4,4 January 2010
As Good as It Gets," This movie really is As Good as it Gets
","It is described as a comedy that comes from the heart that goes straight for the throat,As Good as it Gets has it all.The film boasts a great storyline as well as fine directing from James L.Brooks.Another great thing about the film was the casting which was great for the film having actors such as Jack Nicholson,HelenHunt,Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Junior being part of the film.Jack Nicholson stars as an obsessive compulsive romance novelist by the name of Melvin Udall who doesn't appear very friendly.But after one of his neighbours,Simon Bishop(Greg Kinnear)is hospitalized,Melvin develops an act of kindness.Because of the obsessive compulsive disorder,Melvin maintains a daily schedule of events such as sitting on the same table at the same restaurant much to the chagrin of Carol Connelly(Helen Hunt).The film won Academy Awards for Best Actor-Jack Nicholson and Best Actress-Helen Hunt as well as being nominated for Best Supporting Actor-Greg Kinnear,Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.Overall,this film is As Good as it Gets!",10,3,5,25 March 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino at his tantalizingly best
","Surprisingly,this is the first film of Quentin Tarantino's that I have had the privilege of watching. A couple of reasons led me to watch Inglorious Basterds which include the hype the film received, admiration for Tarantino's films despite never watching one previous to this one and other movies or directors using a similar style(eg. Coen Brothers-No Country for Old Men),etc.Having watched this film twice, I would have to say in my opinion, I see a strong chance for this film to win a Best Picture Oscar as well as a Best Director Oscar for Mr. Tarantino. I thought it should also be given a chance in the Screen writing category.With films that have such a good ensemble such as this one, it is sometimes hard to choose who was the best. Even with the star power of Brad Pitt, I think it is Christoph Waltz who steals the show as Colonel Hans Landa. From the first moment I saw him on screen, I said to myself'this guy is going to steal the show and could possibly snare an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor,even a win if possible.'Also starring in the ensemble cast is Melanie Laurent,Diane Kruger,Michael Fassbender,Eli Roth,Til Schweiger and Daniel Bruhl.",10,0,5,17 January 2010
Shaun of the Dead," Bloody fantastic
","If this were an American film,I might not have liked it as much so it was natural that it was a British film.Shaun of the Dead follows the story of a man named Shaun(Simon Pegg) who is your typical loser who's life is going nowhere.Parallel to that,a plague is happening and it turns a lot of people into zombies and Shaun has to deal with his own problems and the zombie one at the same time.The film boasts a humorous support cast including Nick Frost,Dylan Moran and Bill Nighy among others.The rest of the cast help set up Simon Pegg to be one of the best upcoming funny men around which in my view is pivotal to this film's success.On another good note,it beats having to watch another annoying American comedy when there is one available in your own backyard.To wrap it all up,bloody fantastic.",10,3,7,4 October 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Narnia has it all: a lion,a witch,a wardrobe and more
","A film that can capture imagination of people like other movies such as Harry Potter,The Chronicles of Narnia:The Lion,The Witch and The Wardrobe also equals films like that and gives us a good glimpse of intelligent imagination as well as being hugely entertaining. The film is based on the novel by C.S.Lewis of the same name,it focuses on the Pevensie's who are siblings,two brothers,Peter(William Moseley) and Edmund(Skandar Keynes) and two sisters,Lucy(Georgie Henley) and Susan(Anna Popplewell) who accidentally discover the magical land of Narnia and are caught in the middle of a conflict between Aslan the Lion's(voiced by Oscar nominee Liam Neeson) forces and the White Witch's(Oscar winner Tilda Swinton) forces and at the same time run into many magical creatures such as Mr Tumnus,the Faun(James McAvoy),etc.",10,1,2,7 June 2008
Superbad," Superbad was Supergood but not Supergreat compared to Knocked Up
","Another great movie produced by Judd Apatow and Apatow productions,Superbad is about two teenagers,Seth(Jonah Hill) and Evan(Michael Cera) who are approximately two weeks away from graduation but problems arise for the two best friends as they are invited to a graduation party by Jules who tells them to provide alcohol. Evan and Seth then find out their friend Fogell is going to get a fake ID and they tell Fogell that he can come with them to the party if he gets them the alcohol that they need to get for the party but then Seth and Evan desert Fogell as they think he is apprehended by Officer Slater(Saturday Night Live's Bill Hader) and Officer Michaels(Seth Rogen) but in actual fact, the officers befriend him. Superbad was good but in my opinion,Knocked Up was the better and more hilarious of the two movies and Seth Rogen's performance was better in Knocked Up than in this movie Superbad but either way, both performances were die-hard hilarious.",9,1,5,23 September 2007
Troy," A tale of historic proportions in typical Hollywood fashion
","Another historic epic,Troy has a great storyline,ensemble cast,good directing,acting,etc.Directed by Wolfgang Petersen,the film tells the story of legendary Greek warrior Achilles(played by Brad Pitt) and the battle of Troy which pitted the Greeks which were led by King Agamemnon(Brian Cox) against the Trojans(residents of Troy)led by Prince Hector(Eric Bana) and King Priam(legendary actor Peter O'Toole).The war started as a result of a love affair between Prince Paris of Troy(Orlando Bloom) and Queen Helen of Sparta, later of Troy(Diane Kruger) who became sick and tired of her husband,King Menelaus of Sparta(Brendan Gleeson).Good support from Rose Byrne,Sean Bean,Julie Christie,etc.",10,7,10,10 June 2008
Juno," A star is born
","One of the most original movies that I have watched that comes to mind,Juno is truly spectacular and truly original.Ellen Page stars as the title character and outlandish character Juno MacGuff who is a 16 year old high school girl who decides to have a baby with her friend,Paulie Bleeker(Superbad's Michael Cera),she realises that she is not ready.She considers all options but decides that letting a couple adopting the baby is the best choice for Juno.Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman play Vanessa Loring and Mark Loring respectively who are the couple Juno is looking for.Allison Janney and J.K Simmons play Juno's parents.Great ensemble cast to one of the best films of the year.This film is good because it doesn't just look at pregnancy but life in general for a 16 year old.Nominated for 4 Academy Awards including Best Actress-Ellen Page,Best Picture,Best Director-Jason Reitman in only his second directing feature(after Thank You for Smoking) and Best Original Screenplay-Diablo Cody who proves that her screenplay is one of the best since Charlie Kaufman first put pen to paper.Juno is also Diablo Cody's writing debut.The good thing about this movie is that is similar in contrasts to movies such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Little Miss Sunshine in terms of mixing some comedy with some drama.Bravo!",10,3,9,25 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End
","I think it was a barrel of laughs,fun,action and suspense all rolled into one.Great performances by Orlando Bloom,Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley as well as good supporting performances by Chow-Yun Fat and Geoffrey Rush.It was more hilarious than the previous two.Great movie for all those who like action movies and families.The special effects and scenery were brilliantly exposed by the creative effects department who worked on this film.It is also a film which if you don't focus,it could easily confuse you.Good directing and producing by the team.It was just as good as the previous two,if not more better because there is more action and even a little bit of romance thrown in the barrel.",10,19,31,30 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Spidey swings for his best shot
","Out of the Spiderman trilogy,this movie,Spiderman 3 will go down as the best out of the three as it has more story lines than the previous two,more humour and better special effects as well as more villains instead of one primary villain like the other two movies had. The cast of this movie includes Spiderman veterans Tobey Maguire who plays the familiar neighbourhood Spiderman/Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst who plays his constant love interest Mary Jane Watson and James Franco who plays Peter's so called best friend Harry Osborn and The New Goblin after gaining that power in an almost identical manner and method that his father Norman Osborn(played by Willem Dafoe) had previously used. Other cast members include Thomas Haden Church who plays one of the three villains in this movie which is Flint Marko/Sandman, Topher Grace who plays one of the other three villains in this movie which is Eddward'Eddie' Brock Jr., Bryce Dallas Howard as one of Spiderman's other love interests,Gwen Stacy, James Cromwell as Gwen's father and Police Captain George Stacy, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and J.k. Simmons as the Daily Bugle Chief Editor John Jonah Jameson.",10,2,3,20 September 2007
Crash," A slice of Americana in a multi-ethnic point of view
","Crash is a movie which has characters of different ethnicities such as White,Black,Hispanic,Asian and Middle Easterner that sometimes put aside their differences to cooperate if necessary. It is set in Los Angeles where the film starts at a site of a possible murder and then it gets shown in a flashback perspective.Impressive performances by Don Cheadle,Matt Dillon,Thandie Newton,Terence Howard,Sandra Bullock and Ryan Phillipe as well as surprise appearances by William Fichtner and Brendan Fraser. I think this movie deserved to win the Academy Award for Best Picture and at some parts of the movie,it kept me guessing as to what would the end result be and I gave it 10/10.",10,0,5,21 July 2007
Blades of Glory," It kicked some ice
","The movie,Blades of Glory which stars Will Ferrell and Jon Heder is a movie about two Olympic Skaters in the Men's Division who fight over who is the winner as it was a draw and then they get banned for life. It is then revealed they were only banned from their division which in this case was the Men's Single's so they discover a loophole to allow them to compete on one condition,they have to partner up. It is one of the best and one of the most hilarious comedies that I have watched in a fair while.Excellent routines and excellent casting with the likes of Will Ferrell,Jon Heder,William Fichtner and Craig T.Nelson as the team's coach.",8,0,3,23 June 2007
Lost in Translation," The translation of a good film
","Nominated for three Academy Awards,Lost in Translation is a movie as the title suggests,needs no translation.It isn't complex nor simple in terms of it's storyline but there is one thing that it is;well written.It won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay(Sofia Coppola) who was also nominated for Best Director.The other Oscar nomination the film received was Best Actor-Bill Murray.It is completely original and has a good storyline.Bill Murray stars as Bob Harris who is an aging Hollywood movie star and meets Charlotte(Scarlett Johansson) by chance whilst in Tokyo.The movie is excellent in terms of the relationship shown between the two main characters which is what keeps the power of this film rolling.Highly recommended.",8,0,4,7 March 2008
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump is a movie masterpiece that won't be forgotten and will continue to inspire
","He may have been good in Philadelphia but be is excellent in Forrest Gump.Tom Hanks delivers another great performance in his career by portraying the lovable,king yet not so intelligent character Forrest Gump.It is also Tom Hanks' second straight win for the Best Actor Oscar which he becomes the second man to do said accomplishment after Spencer Tracy.Whilst not as dramatic as Philadelphia,Tom Hanks' performance is just as great in this movie and this movie could possibly be the film of Tom Hanks' career as he used to be a comedy guy who turned to drama in a way which would paved for future stars such as Jim Carrey(The Truman Show),Reese Witherspoon(Walk the Line) and Will Ferrell(Stranger Than Fiction) to name a few.Also staring in this great movie classic are Robin Wright-Penn who plays Jenny,Gary Sinise who was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Lieutenant Dan Taylor,Mykelti Williamson as Forrest's best friend and shrimper Benjamin Buford'Bubba' Blue and Sally Field as Mrs.Gump.This film was nominated for a total of thirteen Academy Awards but won six of them which include Best Film Editing,Best Visual Effects,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Picture,Best Director-Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor-Tom Hanks.This is one masterpiece of a movie that will not be forgotten about in a long time.Bravo!",10,147,191,15 December 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne to be the best of the Bourne films
","This was a best of the Bourne films.The Bourne Ultimatum sort of picks up where the Borune Supremacy finished which is in Moscow,Russia.Throughout the film,Jason Bourne(played fantastically by Matt Damon) travels to Moscow,Russia, London,UK, Madrid,Spain, Paris,France, Tangier,Morocco and New York City,USA. Also starring in this movie is David Strathairn as Noah Vosen who is a Deputy Director of the CIA, main antagonist and head of Operation Blackbriar which is an upgraded Treadstone ,Joan Allen as Pamela Landy who is also a CIA Deputy Director, Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons and Albert Finney as Dr,Albert Hirsch who was a CIA specialist who supervised the behaviour modification on David Webb who would be renamed Jason Bourne prior to working on Operation Treadstone. I gave it ten out of ten as it is sure to give other action and spy movies a run for it's money.",10,1,3,31 August 2007
10 Things I Hate About You," A highlight for Heath
","10 Things I Hate About You made a couple of young actors into young stars including Australia's Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles.Based on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew,it follows Katarina'Kat' Stratford(Julia Stiles) who is the 'shrew' who is convinced to date mysterious bad boy Patrick Verona(Heath Ledger) who is essentially 'taming the shrew' so that Cameron James(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is the new kid at Padua High School who lays eyes on Kat's sister,Bianca(Larisa Oleynik) can date her due to her father's bizarre rules.The rest of the cast also includes the likes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt,David Krumholtz(portrays Michael Eckman who is Cam's best friend),Andrew Keegan(Joey Donner who is looking to date Bianca),and comedian Larry Miller as Dr.Walter Stratford,the sisters' father.Overall a good job by the cast but in my view I think it is Heath Ledger who steals the show due to his character's personality and the way he interacts with just about everything else.",8,0,0,21 August 2008
Disturbia," Disturbia is on Shia ground
","One of the best films for the year 2007,Disturbia follows Kale Brecht(rising star Shia Labeouf) who has to endure three months house arrest following an incident that occurs at school.If you think he was good in Transformers,watch this movie as this is the movie that really gives Shia Labeouf his place as an actor to watch out for after doing years of movies where he is a sidekick instead of a main character(with exception to Holes).This is really a movie that is hard to hate and David Morse co-stars as a psychotic next door neighbour,Robert Turner and Carrie-Anne Moss as Kale's mother. Disturbia borrows some elements from Rear Window but is aimed mainly at teens to adults.",10,1,3,3 January 2008
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Better now than ever
","A comedy that would provide inspiration to future sex comedies such as Superbad and Knocked Up and one that should not be missed,The 40 Year Old Virgin would be another great Judd Apatow styled film.Steve Carell stars as Andy Stitzer who is as the title suggests,a 40 year old virgin.His friends urge him to have sex but he constantly refuses as he is afraid of mishaps.Judd Apatow regulars Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd(who co-stared with Carell in Anchorman) co-star in this delightful sex comedy that will be remembered for the ages.Catherine Keener also co-stars as Trish who is about Andy's age and a mother of three.The film has a good cast,a good script and storyline as well as some absolutely die-hard hilarious moments.A good watch for anyone who has a good comedy sense.Bravo!",10,1,4,19 January 2008
Collateral," Collateral= Top notch drama-thriller at it's best
","Collateral is another one of my personal favorites.Directed by Michael Mann,this film would be one of the two best Michael Mann's film alongside Heat. The film stars Tom Cruise in a rare villainous role as a sociopathic hit-man by the name of Vincent who is hired for five hits in a single night to take down witnesses in a case against Felix Reyes-Torrena(Academy Award nominee Javier Bardem) and Jamie Foxx who plays Max Durocher who is a cab driver who accidentally gets caught up in Vincent's path whilst driving him around Los Angeles.This film co-stars Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie Farrell,a prosecutor in the aforementioned case and one of Vincent's target and Mark Ruffalo as Detective Ray Fanning who discovers the string of murders and finds out more clues as to what is happening in the night.This film was also nominated for two Academy Awards including Best Supporting Actor-Jamie Foxx and Best Film Editing.But I was surprised that Tom Cruise wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award as this was his best role to date and that Jamie Foxx wasn't considered the lead actor as he had more dialogue but Tom Cruise had more actions.Either way,this film will go down as one of my personal favorites.Bravo!",10,1,1,23 December 2007
Ratatouille," Pixar Studios serves it's best meal(no pun intended)/movie
","Another great animation from Pixar Studios, Ratatouille is a movie that is best served warm(pardon the pun). It essentially follows the journey of Remy the rat(Patton Oswalt) who leaves the colony by accidental means and ends up in Paris.He is caught snooping around in the recently deceased Gusteau's restaurant by a garbage boy by the name of Alfredo Linguini(Lou Romano) who is later revealed to be the son of Auguste Gusteau(Brad Garrett). But in my view one of the more interesting characters is the mean food critic Anton Ego(played brilliantly by screen legend Peter O'Toole) as he is the main villain in a way and as his performance was sort of a dramatic one, I think he should get an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. This film should also be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature as well as the aforementioned Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Peter O'Toole. A great movie with a great taste.Bravo!",10,1,2,12 October 2007
Tropic Thunder," A story that contains irony,drama,destruction and comedy
","There have been some good comedies in the years but this is probably the most intelligent and witty one that I have ever seen as it picks on certain groups such as celebrities,The Academy Awards which ironically enough got Robert Downey Jr. an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor this year,drug abuse and more.The main cast is brilliantly handled as Ben Stiller,Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr deliver their roles good especially Robert Downey Jr having battled problems of his own and making an incredible comeback.The other members of the main cast who also performed well include Jay Baruchel,Brandon T Jackson,Nick Nolte,Danny McBride,Steve Coogan,Matthew McConaughey and Tom Cruise.In short,casting is brilliant and I am surprised that the film was nominated for Golden Globes(Best Supporting Actor for Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr.),SAG award,BAFTA award and the Academy Award.But the praise mostly goes to Ben Stiller in terms of the amount of work he had done in this production such as writing,producing,directing and even acting in this.A great film overall.",10,2,6,14 March 2009
The Usual Suspects," Not your usual crime-drama/thriller
","One of the best crime/thrillers out there,The Usual Suspects has one of the best plot twist endings ever for a movie.Five criminals are lined up and really have nothing in common.The film is told using flashback and narration as it tells the story of Roger 'Verbal' Kint (two time Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey who won his first Oscar for this film-Best Supporting Actor)who is a small time con-man being interrogated by U.S Customs Agent Dave Kujan(Academy Award nominee Chazz Palminteri) over an incident that takes place near a shipping yard in Los Angeles.The film has a great ensemble cast to it with the likes of ,Stephen Baldwin,future Academy Award winner Benicio Del Toro,Kevin Pollak,Gabriel Byrne and Academy Award nominee Pete Postlethwaite.It also won the Best Original Screenplay(Christopher McQuarrie) and was directed by Bryan Singer(X-Men)Bravo to all those involved in a spectacular crime classic like The Usual Suspects!",10,4,6,28 January 2008
No Country for Old Men," There are no clean getaways in Coen Country
","Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen(Coen brothers) deliver their biggest hit since Fargo.No Country for Old Men is a modern day classic/masterpiece that even has a bit of comedy mixed in it which is reminiscent of Fargo but the main genres are Crime,Drama,Thriller and Western.Tommy Lee Jones,Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are perfectly cast in their particular roles for the film as well as Woody Harrelson but it is Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh and Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss that really steal the show.By the time the Academy Awards come,I think that this film will be in strong contention for a few Academy Awards such as Best Picture,Best Supporting Actor for both Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin,Best Directing-Coen Brothers and Best Adapted Screenplay.Bravo to a modern day classic.",10,0,5,29 December 2007
Mamma Mia!," Mamma Mia! What a great film.
","Mamma Mia!What a great film.The film has everything ranging from a great setting,great casting,singing and dancing,storyline,etc.This film is not about the group ABBA in a biopic form but is about fictional characters who come together through use of ABBA songs.The film is about the story of a girl by the name of Sophie Sheridan(Amanda Seyfried from Mean Girls) who lives with her mother Donna(Meryl Streep) who runs a hotel on a small Greek island.Sophie wants to marry Sky(newcomer Dominic Cooper) and her father to be present;the problem is that Sophie doesn't know who her father is but she finds three men who could possibly be her father,Sam Carmichael(Pierce Brosnan) who is an American architect,Harry Bright(Colin Firth) who is a British banker and Bill Anderson(Stellan Skarsgard) who is a Swedish novelist.Sophie then invites them all to the wedding.Christine Baranski and Julie Walters join the fun as two of Donna's longtime friends.The film was a blast and in my opinion should at least be nominated for several Oscars such as Best Actress-Meryl Streep,Best Picture,etc.Also worth a mention is Pierce Brosnan's singing;the critics hated his singing but I thought he was good enough for my standards as he at least gave it a go.Overall,a fun and enjoyable film.",10,8,14,12 July 2008
Batman Begins," The beginning of great things to come
","It is the first Batman movie I have watched and I must say,I was hugely impressed.Though I have not watched other Batman movies,I can tell that this looks better than those made in the 90's.In a reboot of the franchise,the story starts at the beginning,hence the name of the title.Christian Bale stars as the titular character,Batman as well as his alter ego,Bruce Wayne.After certain issues in Gotham City that occur to Bruce,he leaves and travels the world in search of looking for something.He encounters a mysterious man by the name of Henri Ducard(Oscar nominee Liam Neeson in one of his best roles) among others.The cast was great including the likes of Christian Bale,Liam Neeson,Michael Caine,Gary Oldman,Morgan Freeman and even Katie Holmes.What was also good is the film focused on character and storyline development instead of on just the action and Christopher Nolan is the man to thank for that as he directed the film and written the screenplay for the film.Watching this today has made me even more excited for the next Batman film,The Dark Knight.Well done to everyone who worked to make this film a great film.",10,3,4,17 July 2008
Twilight," The film meets up to it's hype
","Out of all of the movies I have seen over the last few years, I can't remember hearing about a movie that has been so hyped up by various forms of the media and a movie that I have been anxiously waiting to see. Let me tell you that in my opinion that this movie meets up to the hype surrounding it.For those who like a bit of suspense and romance in movies, this is one for you to watch.Before this movie came out, I had never even heard of it or the novel that it is based on. The movie is a different sort of romance movie as it concerns a human-vampire relationship. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart display the right amount of on-screen chemistry as Edward Cullen and Bella Swan respectively to be an effective on-screen duo; in other words,their roles were well cast.Other cast members such as Taylor Lautner, Cam Gigandet,Peter Facinelli,Nikki Reed and Billy Burke among others performed well in the supporting cast.",8,0,4,7 July 2009
Liar Liar," Liar,Liar!
","A touching and humorous film,Golden Globe nominee Jim Carrey stars as Fletcher Reede who is a fast talking lawyer and father.There is an unintended pun where his son mistakes the word 'liar' for 'lawyer' as the words sound similar but it is later implying that Fletcher is a lawyer who lies.His son makes a birthday wish which means he cannot lie to anyone for 24 hours.As of that moment,hilarity ensues.Fletcher's wife,Audrey(Maura Tierney) is fed up with Fletcher who keeps letting his son down and tries to move to Boston with her new beau,Jerry(Cary Elwes).Other memorable characters includes Fletcher's secretary, Greta(Anne Haney),Fletcher's son,Max(Justin Cooper),Fletcher's client,Samantha Cole(Oscar nominee Jennifer Tilly),etc.Overall, it sends a positive message like Mrs.Doubtfire plus the film is hilarious.",9,0,1,9 June 2008
The Number 23," An underrated yet good thriller
","A movie that is mind-bending and compulsively watchable,The Number 23 is a good example of a true psychological thriller.Many things in the film were either unexpected or not expected.The film focuses on Walter Sparrow(Jim Carrey) who begins reading a novel by the name of The Number 23 which focuses on a character called Detective Fingerling(also played by Jim Carrey) which Walter sees as similar to himself.Virginia Madsen and the rest of the cast were also good but in a way,Jim Carrey stole the show.In my view,Jim Carrey gives one of his best but also most interesting and different performances of his career.He proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he can be a serious actor to be reckoned with.It is a bit of a shame that he was nominated for a Razzie Award instead of a Golden Globe or Oscar for his performance as well as getting negative reviews and being underrated.It was directed and written well.Good effort,though.",8,1,2,29 July 2008
Transformers," Transforming the action genre of films
","Out of all the action movies that I have ever watched,this would be one of my favorite as there is no cheesy romantic scenes which waste time and instead there is a few comedic scenes which I would rather prefer.Despite not watching the cartoons and collecting figurines,I found the movie rather enjoyable. The film stars Shia Labeouf,Megan Fox,Josh Duhamel,Tyrese Gibson,John Turturro,Jon Voight and up and coming Australian actress Rachel Taylor. This movie had great action scenes and comedic scenes and I am glad there was no cheesy romantic scenes that feature prominently in other action films. If there were more action films like this with less romantic scenes,then there would be more meaning to action films.",10,4,9,30 June 2007
Dumb and Dumber," Carrey and Daniels deliver an intelligent yet dumb- in- a- good- way performance
","One of the funniest films of the 1990's,it has the craft of a comedy classic.Directed by the Farrelly brothers,this movie doesn't fail to deliver some good laughs and some creativity.Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels star as Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne respectively who are, as the title suggests,a bunch of dimwits who find a briefcase and then chase up the owner.It is better than your stereotypical buddy/road trip comedy and some scenes suggest it gives new meaning to the words dumb,stupid,idiotic and toilet humour.It is also a good comedy that doesn't age,it just gets better by age which is surprising for a movie almost fifteen years old.",10,1,2,23 February 2008
Mission: Impossible II," Mission Intriguing
","This movie,Mission Impossible 2 is a step up from the first one in some ways such as who is who with the rubber mask gig and it contains more action than the first one however it isn't as mind boggling as the first one was but still had a mystery sense in it. It was also better as it had a slightly better cast with returnees Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames but also new additions such as Dougray Scott as the villain,Sean Ambrose,Thandie Newton as the cunning thief,Nyah Hall, and countless others as I knew this cast better than the previous Mission Impossible's cast. Another reason was that this time, it was a race against the clock type action movie with heart pounding moments such as the rubber mask getting ripped off a dead guy only to find out that it isn't who you wanted dead,etc. Altogether,it was an above average action movie.",8,1,2,4 July 2007
The Dark Knight," Not just a superhero action film,an absolute classic of a film is The Dark Knight
","I have waited for this film for so long and now I have had the privilege of watching it.Most of this movie came to me as a surprise.The Dark Knight is one of,if not,the best film of the year and probably ever made.It is one of my favorite films.It was more than a action film to me,it was an epic like Heat,The Godfather saga and Scarface among others.Christopher Nolan was brilliant at directing this so in my view,he should be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director as well as the film as a whole being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay as well as the Academy Award for Best Picture.Christian Bale stars as Batman/Bruce Wayne who proves that he is just as good as he was in Batman Begins,if not better.The cast also includes Gary Oldman(Jim Gordon),Michael Caine(Alfred),Morgan Freeman(Lucius) as well as William Fichtner,Eric Roberts,Aaron Eckhart(Harvey Dent),Maggie Gyllenhaal(Rachel Dawes) and the late,great Heath Ledger as the Joker.The cast was magnificent but I think it was Heath Ledger who made me feel proud to watch this film.His performance is worthy of an Academy Award win for Best Actor as he gave it his all and more than 100% of an effort for his role as The Joker.We will all miss you,Heath and your character who you made iconic.Rest in Peace.Heath Ledger-1979-2008.",10,2,5,19 July 2008
Into the Wild," The adventure of a lifetime
","In my view,one of the best films of the year,Into the Wild is so good and dramatic that it should get a couple of Academy Award nominations.Emile Hirsch stars as Christopher McCandless who is a recent graduate at Emory University but decides to give up his possible future career for exploring Alaska without money.Because Emile Hirsch put a lot into this film such as losing more than twenty pounds and all,I think that he should be nominated at least for an Academy Award for Best Actor as he put in just as much,if not more work than most other potential candidates.Academy Award winners Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt provide good supporting roles as well as Academy Award nominee Catherine Keener and in a way,Vince Vaughn.Besides an Oscar nomination for Emile Hirsch,Into the Wild should also be nominated for Best Picture,Best Director-Sean Penn and Best Writing.Bravo!",10,2,6,6 January 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Eternal glory for the romance genre
","Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind is hardly like any other movie I have watched,in a good way of course.It deals with the two main characters,Joel Barish(Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski(2004 Academy Awards Best Actress nominee Kate Winslet) who meet each other and strike up a relationship between each other.Clementine gets her memory erased to forget the bad parts of her relationships.Joel finds out and does the same after meeting the creator of the process,Dr Howard Mierzwiak(Tom Wilkinson).Kirsten Dunst,Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood join the ride in this romantic-dramatic and sometimes comedic film about the poignant looks of breakups,breakdowns and breakthroughs in a stereotypical romance between lovers.",8,2,6,5 January 2008
Taken," 'Taken' by surprise
","If there is one action-thriller that is under the definition of 'underrated action-thrillers', this is one that is certain to top the list. Liam Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA paramilitary operative who has to track down a group of slave traders who take his daughter Kim(Maggie Grace). I won't give away too many details but I will say it is a strong film that blends action, suspense and drama in a nicely concocted cocktail. The support cast such as Famke Janssen, Xander Berkeley, Katie Cassidy and Maggie Grace all played their parts well. The film was directed and written well and it's a throwback to films like the Bourne movies and the Bond movies.",10,5,9,1 January 2010
Mission: Impossible," The most Impossible of missions turned out to be the best
","Out of all the Mission:Impossible movies,this is my favorite as instead of lots of action like the next two sequels,this one instead is more of a mystery/thriller and has the best plot out of the trilogy as it twists and turns so fast that you wouldn't even know who the main villain is. Tom Cruise stars as IMF Agent Ethan Hunt who after an operation gone wrong,he suddenly finds out he was framed for the murder of his five teammates by a mysterious individual known as Job 3-14(later revealed to be Jim Phelps who is played marvelously by Jon Voight who was the mastermind behind the botched operation and received help from Franz Krieger) but Hunt is instead led to believe it was Eugene Kittridge(played by Henry Czerny) who presumes that Ethan Hunt is the mole as he is the only surviving member of his team. Ethan then learns that Clair Phelps(Emmanuelle Beart)who is/was Jim Phelps' wife also survived the mission and then Ethan begins with correspondence with an individual known as Max which is probably short for Maxine as it is a woman(played by veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave). Max then tells Ethan to get her the Non-Official Cover(NOC) list for her in exchange for the identity of the mole(Jim Phelps) as the list stolen from the US Embassy in Prague was a fake and the real one is in the CIA Headquarters in Langley,Virginia which is outside Washington,D.C and then Ethan would need two people from the Disavowed list. Ethan would recruit Luther Stickell(Ving Rhames) and Claire would recruit Franz Krieger(Jean Reno) who would later be revealed to be assisting Jim Phelps. But besides the great cast of this movie and the complex,brain-teasing script,another great thing about this movie was the plot,stunts,special effects and the director Brian De Palma who directed such movies as Scarface,Carlito's Way and The Untouchables. Great job by everyone involved with this film and it is now one of my immediate favorite spy/action/thriller films.",10,3,6,2 October 2007
Life Is Beautiful," A movie that truly proves that Life is Beautiful
","This movie is one of the ten best movies I have ever watched. Life is Beautiful(La Vita e Bella) is an Italian film which is set in 1930's Arezzo,Tuscany which is in central Italy. Roberto Benigni's performance as the imaginative and humorous Guido Orefice is one of my favorite characters in film but Benigni is also good as he also directed and co-wrote the script for this film. This film won three Academy Awards which were Best Actor-Roberto Benigni, Best Foreign Film and Best Dramatic Music Score and was also nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture,Best Director-Roberto Benigni, Film Editing and Best Original Screenplay which it would win three out of the seven. This is one of my ten favorite movies of all time which I usually compare with The Truman Show as it starts out comedic but quickly takes a dramatic turn. Even thought this film is in Italian,this is still a film that cannot be missed.",10,2,3,6 October 2007
Groundhog Day," A comedy classic that is well written and sends a good message to viewers about self-importance
","One of the best comedies I have watched,Groundhog Day succeeds in delivering comedy through one-liners and sarcasm as well as an original storyline.Bill Murray stars as an arrogant TV weatherman from Pittsburgh who decides to travel to Punxsutawney,Pennsylvania with his producer Rita(Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry(Chris Elliott) in order to cover the Groundhog Day festivities in which the rest of the season's weather is determined by Punxsutawney Phil who is a groundhog.Because Phil Connors(Bill Murray) is self-centered,things go bad for him as the day repeats itself which means that Phil is stuck in a personal time warp.Because of this,it means that he doesn't have to worry about tomorrow and gives him a chance to right his wrongs.Besides a great deal of comedy,this film also sends a philosophical message to everyone watching this film that it is never too late to make your wrongs turn into rights.Because of all of this,it has become a cult classic,culturally significant and a film that will never be forgotten.It should have been nominated for at least a Best Actor Oscar for Bill Murray and a Best Original Screenplay Oscar.It is as well written as dramas such as The Truman Show and La Vita e Bella.Definitely recommended and it is Bill Murray at his best.Bravo!",10,1,3,12 April 2008
Mystic River," Classic Clint directs a Mystic Masterpiece
","Back in the year 2003,if there was one movie not to be missed,it is this one.Mystic River has all the basic qualities about a film that makes it better-than-good such as a good cast,good directing as well as a good script and storyline.Sean Penn,Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon star as three friends(Jimmy Markum,Dave Boyle and Sean Devine respectively) who grow up in suburban,working-class Boston who each have a falling out after an incident but then years later,they are reconnected through certain events.Sean Penn and Tim Robbins act their parts well considering they won the Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively but other cast members that were also impressive include Kevin Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden whilst Laura Linney and Laurence Fishburne were OK at best.Clint Eastwood directs this movie good as well.The big shock here is that this film didn't win Best Picture which after watching this found that outrageous.It should have won but either way,it was a good film for 2003.",8,1,2,18 January 2009
The Departed," A crime classic from the great Martin Scorsese
","A movie about the Irish Mob versus the Massachusetts State Police which is set in modern day Boston,this movie,The Departed follows two men,rookie cop William'Billy'Costigan(played superbly by frequent Scorsese collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan(played brilliantly by Matt Damon in a role like none of his others). The main villain that is causing all the trouble is Francis'Frank'Costello(played excellently by Jack Nicholson) however getting him is the hard part because he has a mole in the State Police.In my view,the main factor of this movie is that Billy Costigan is undercover in Costello's mob but is working for the State Police at the same time whilst Colin Sullivan is working for the State Police but is however faithful to Costello more than the police. There were also good performances from Mark Wahlberg,Martin Sheen,Ray Winstone,Vera Farmiga and Alec Baldwin.This film definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar as well as a Best Director for well renowned mob thriller director Martin Scorsese who directed Goodfellas,Casino,Gangs of New York,etc.",10,1,3,13 August 2007
Love Actually," Love Actually isn't the funniest movie ever but is actually pretty enjoyable to watch
","It wasn't exactly the funniest film of all time but it was great and enjoyable especially the romantic-dramatic part of Love Actually which explores the highs and lows of relationships in the weeks building up to Christmas and the combination of all stories to make not just one love story but ten different ones.Another great thing about the movie was the cast involved.The cast is mostly British and includes Hugh Grant,Liam Neeson,Colin Firth,Alan Rickman,Emma Thompson,Keira Knightley,Bill Nighy, cameos by Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Atkinson and American actress and Academy Award nominee Laura Linney.Improvements could have been more interaction between characters even if they are in different stories,etc.",8,0,1,5 December 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," A highly rated / A-rated/A grade comedy worth watching
","A comedy that deserves to be in top place next to great comedies such as Wild Hogs and Knocked Up,Anchorman:The Legend of Ron Burgundy is about the reporter of the same name,Ron Burgundy(Will Ferrell in his best and most memorable role) who is working with the Channel 4 news team that also includes Brian Fantana(Paul Rudd), Brick Tamland(Steve Carell) and Champ Kind(David Koechner) which the team is garnering great reviews for Channel 4 but problems start to arise when Veronica Corningstone(Christina Appelgate) arrives on the scene. Another great thing about this movie is cameos by some well known actors such as Jack Black(Mean Motorbike guy),Luke Wilson(Frank Vitchard who is a Channel 2 new reporter and anchorman),Ben Stiller(Spanish language reporter) and more importantly Vince Vaughnas Wes Mantooth who works for KQHS Channel Nine Evening News Team who is also Ron Burgundy's chief rival. One of the funniest scenes in this movie is where they are fighting near the sewers. A great performance by all. Bravo!",10,2,4,14 October 2007
American Gangster," The greatest gangster story ever told
","Another great gangster movie,American Gangster is based on a true story unlike some other gangster shows but this movie in particular deserves to be mentioned alongside some other great gangster-police shows such as Heat,The Godfather saga,Goodfellas and The Departed.Ridley Scott directs this movie to almost absolute perfection and joins other well renowned crime directors such as Michael Mann(Heat),Francis Ford Coppola(Godfather saga),Martin Scorsese(Goodfellas and The Departed) and Brian De Palma(Scarface).This film is also based on a true story.Denzel Washington stars as real life former Harlem heroin kingpin Frank Lucas who smuggled heroin into the United States during the Vietnam War and Russel Crowe co-stars as Detective Richie Roberts who works in Newark,New Jersey and is determined to bring down Lucas whilst juggling a failing marriage,law school classes and his police career.This film was so good that in my view,it is very much Oscar worthy and should possibly get Oscar nods for Best Director-Ridley Scott,Best Actor-Denzel Washington,Best Supporting Actor-Russell Crowe or Josh Brolin,Best Picture and Best Suppporting Actress for Ruby Dee for Mama Lucas despite being in the film for approximately just ten minutes as she delivers a good performance as Mama Lucas.A true crime classic!",10,1,4,16 January 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," A movie of Fiction that aims for the Truth
","Another good movie that proves that mainly comedic actors can perform well in dramas,Stranger than Fiction is a drama with a bit of comedy thrown in.Will Ferrell follows in the footsteps of comedic actors who have made the transition to dramas such as Jim Carrey(The Mask to The Truman Show),Robin Williams(Mrs.Doubtfire to Good Will Hunting),Tom Hanks(Big to Philadelphia),Adam Sandler(Click-Reign Over Me).Besides starring Will Ferrell,the supporting cast includes the likes of Maggie Gyllenhaal,Dustin Hoffman,Quenn Latifah and Emma Thompson.For this film,Will Ferrell was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor-Musical or Comedy but I feel that instead of that particular award that Will Ferrell's Golden Globe nomination should have been in the Drama category.Stranger than Fiction in a way has a vibrant feel reminiscent to The Truman Show and this film indeed borrows certain elements from that film such as the main characters unaware of their surroundings until something out of the ordinary happens.Bravo!",9,1,2,28 December 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," Hope can set you free and so can this remarkable film
","One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor  Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!",10,30,37,30 December 2007
Shrek," An ogre- sized adventure for the ages
","An ogre-sized adventure for the ages,Shrek is one of the best animation films ever made and watching it will make you agree.It is fun not only just for kids but for the entire family.The film basically sets the story of the Shrek storyline.As the name implies,the story is about an ogre by the name of Shrek(voiced by Mike Myers) who keeps to himself until one day when another creature,Donkey(voiced by Eddie Murphy) inadvertently gets saved by Shrek when he is getting chased by minions of Lord Farquaard(voiced by John Lithgow).In order to not be bothered again,Farquaard makes a deal to Shrek: save Princess Fiona(voiced by Cameron Diaz) who is held captive in an abandoned castle by a fire breathing dragon.A must see film for the entire family as it had a good casting,storyline plus the film was the inaugural(first ever) winner of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.",10,0,1,2 July 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," A modern classic that will be talked about for many years to come
","One of the greatest thrillers of all time,Silence of the Lambs delivers all the chills and thrills to make it a top notch movie in it's genre as it joins other great movies such as Misery,The Shining. It is only the third movie to win the Oscar Grand Slam which consists of Academy Award for Best Picture,Best Actor,Best Actress,Best Director and Best Writing.The only other two movies to accomplish this legendary feat include One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and It Happened All One Night. Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling(her second Oscar winning role) who is a young FBI trainee who is sent to ask Dr Hannibal Lecter(Anthony Hopkins in his best role to date which won him an Academy Award) who is a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer for advice on catching a serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill. As mentioned above,this film one five Academy Wards which include Best Director-Jonathan Demme,Best Picture,Best Actor-Anthony Hopkins,Best Actress-Jodie Foster and Best Adapted Screenplay.Bravo to this modern classic film.",10,1,3,29 November 2007
Bruce Almighty," A comedy of Almighty proportions
","If you want to see Evan Almighty,just wait a little bit as you haven't seen nothing almighty yet. Bruce Almighty is the prequel to Evan Almighty and stars Jim Carrey as the Buffalo field reporter who loves to crack a joke,Bruce Nolan who one day feels like he has an unfortunate life and is in deep misery and also stars Jennifer Aniston as Grace Connelly who is Bruce's girlfriend.After Bruce has had his worst day ever, he decides to blame God(Morgan Freeman).But then,God teaches Bruce that being the man himself isn't as easy as it seems. Besides superb performances from Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman also delivers a compelling performance as God as in one of the most memorable scenes in the movie, he appears as the janitor,electrician and boss of the building Bruce goes to visit after receiving a mystery number that was paged to him but Steve Carrell's sort of short but memorable performance is one thing to look out for as well as Philip Baker Hall's character as Bruce's boss Jack Baylor.",10,6,10,27 September 2007
La Vie En Rose," High notes hit home in this astonishing biopic
","One of the best films of the year,La Vie en Rose or La Mome succeeds in delivering a very emotional and touching film. The film is basically about quintessential French singer Edith Piaf and key points in her life,Oscar winner Marion Cotillard proves that her performance in this movie as Edith Piaf was worthy of her winning the Oscar.Her performance in this film is of a very high standard and also proves that no matter what language the film is,in this case it is French that anyone is worthy of an Oscar win.Cotillard hits the high notes in this particular performance as she puts her soul into Piaf's and makes for some interesting acting.The rest of the cast which includes Oscar nominee Gerard Depardieu and others deserve praise.Well done!",10,1,3,31 May 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Live Smarter or Die Harder
","This movie so far is the best action movie I have ever watched. Die Hard 4.0 basically has it all: quirky humour,a damsel in distress and a whole lot of shooting,jaw-dropping stunts and lots of explosions. This movie also has a great cast with the likes of Bruce Willis as the lovable John McClane,Justin Long as Matthew Farrell,Timothy Olyphant as the villain Thomas Gabriel,Cliff Curtis as Deputy Director Miguel Bowman of the FBI and Maggie Q as the villainous henchwoman to Thomas Gabriel,Mai Lihn. If they make a 5th installment of Die Hard,some titles for it should be Live Smarter or Die Harder,Die Hard 5,Live Soft-Die Hard,etc.But overall,this is a great action movie not to be missed and makes some other action movies look like Disneyland.",10,4,9,11 August 2007
Munich," Munich was educational and absolutely brilliant
","The movie,Munich is about a team of Israeli agents(Mossad) tracking down and attempting to kill the 11 Palestinians responsible for murdering the innocent 11 Israeli athletes involved in the Munich Olympic Games of 1972 which judging from the footage shown in this film looked to be one of the worst tragedies that occurred in the 20th Century along with countless other tragedies that occurred as well. Some of the best things about the movie is that it helped the audience learn about something historical and it had a good cast and a good director. The only improvement it needed was that it exceeded the time limit I was expecting. Great cast such as Eric Bana,Daniel Craig and Geoffrey Rush. Out of the all the movies I have watched with Eric Bana in it,it is my favorite Eric Bana movie and I think it is his personal best.Good on you Eric. It was also my favorite movie directed by Steven Spielberg which after watching this,I have realised he is one of,if not, the Best Director in modern day Hollywood. Good on you Steven. It definitely earned a 10/10.",10,4,6,10 June 2007
The Truman Show," The Truman Show is truly a classic and truly original
","This is one of the most creative movies I have ever watched.The Truman Show stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank who is a salesman who suspects that his life isn't as normal as it would seem as he is unknowingly the star of a reality television show which is filming 24/7 that is focused on his life entirely.When I first heard of this movie,I thought it would be a comedy but I soon realised it was more of a drama however there was still some comedy in it.The film also has a good supporting cast in the form of Laura Linney,Noah Emmerich and Ed Harris.It also had a good director in the form of Peter Weir but the one thing that should have been done is that the Academy should have at least given Jim Carrey an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor as he rightfully deserved to be nominated at least and because he is a great actor but would be Hollywood's most underrated actor.But either way,this film was a very great and creative film.",10,0,1,16 August 2007
Heat," A movie that warms me up quickly and is a sure-fire masterpiece
","One of my top ten favorites,Heat is one of the best crime movies ever made as it has good action-thriller sequences,great writing,directing and a great cast.Directed by Michael Mann,this movie is unforgettable as every time I watch it,I realise how great this movie is as the action sequences are as real as it gets such as when gunshots are fired.Al Pacino stars as Lt Vincent Hanna who is a veteran detective who works in the Robbery-Homicide Division and Robert De Niro who plays Neil McCauley who is a professional thief.Not counting Godfather Part 2 as the two do not share scenes with each other,this is unofficially the first time Hollywood legends Al Pacino and Robert De Niro have shared screen time with each other.Besides the two legends,the cast also includes Val Kilmer as Chris Shiherlis who is a compulsive gambler,Tom Sizemore who plays ex-con turned family man Michael Cherrito,Jon Voight as Nate who is McCauley's fence for the stolen bearer bonds and William Fichtner as Roger Van Zant who was the original owner of those bearer bonds.Since this was such a great movie masterpiece,I was shocked that a movie this dramatic was not even nominated for an Academy Award.I cannot wait until the next time Robert De Niro and Al Pacino collaborate in their new movie Righteous Kill.Bravo to all in this finely tuned masterpiece.",10,0,1,7 December 2007
Goodfellas," Better than Good
","Another classic gangster movie,Goodfellas has a good ensemble cast,a good storyline to it and great acting and sort of sets the mold for future gangster movies such as Heat,The Departed and American Gangster.Directed brilliantly by Martin Scorsese who should have rightfully won Best Director for this movie,the movie tells the story of Henry Hill(Ray Liotta) who joins the mob at a young age and meets James'Jimmy' Conway(movie legend Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito(Joe Pesci in his Oscar winning role) and is taken under the wing of Paul'Paulie' Cicero(Paul Sorvino) who is a local mob boss.Also nominated for the Best Picture Oscar as well as Best Supporting Actress Oscar-Lorraine Bracco and Best Adapted Screenplay which Goodfellas should have rightfully won all of those Oscars but won Best Supporting Actor-Joe Pesci.Brilliant job by Martin Scorsese and the cast.A true gangster classic.",10,0,0,8 June 2008
The Godfather," The Godfather of all movies
","One of,if not,the best movie of all time,The Godfather has it all in terms of drama,violence,etc.The thing that is very special about this movie is that it sets the gangster film archetype in concrete and would inspire future gangster greats such as Scarface,Godfather:Part Two and Three,Goodfellas,Carlito's Way,The Departed,etc.This film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola which was adapted from Mario Puzo's novel of the same name.The cast of this movie includes Marlon Brando as the iconic Don Vito Corleone,at the time newcomer Al Pacino as Vito's youngest son,Michael,James Caan as hotheaded Santino'Sonny',Robert Duvall as Consigliere Tom Hagen,Diane Keaton as Michael's love interest,Kay Adams and John Cazale as Fredo Corleone.It would win the Academy Award for Best Picture,Best Actor-Brando and would additionally receive nominations for Best Supporting Actor-James Caan,Al Pacino and Robert Duvall.One of my favorite films and a crime classic.Bravo!Excellent!",10,1,4,21 October 2007
