United 93," 'Nauseating' is the word.
","************'United 93 is shot entirely with hand-held cameras to perfectly capture the realism of the events that happened that day.'*********This is exactly the reason why I spent the last part of the film with my eyes closed because I felt waves of sea sick surging on and off in me and the nausea increased as the camera flashed from one angle to another, from one person to another, let alone the upside down looping of the plane!!! I felt much better when I walked out of the theatre! Apart from my discomfort, it is a good film which reminds us of the inhuman deeds of the terrorists. I managed to force myself to see until the end and my heart went out to the heroic hostesses and the passengers.",7,1,4,30 July 2006
