The Legend of Bagger Vance," finding your authentic self
","Wonderful story, beautifully depicted by Robert Redford and a gifted group of actors. Will Smith has never been better. Charlize Theron -- excellent, but my personal favorite was J. Michael Moncrief as the young Hardy Greaves. And I think this is THE movie in which Matt Damon makes contact with his authentic acting self. Art direction and cinematography should win awards! Thank you, Mr. Redford for this magical two-hour escape far from the maddening world.",Null,0,1,17 November 2000
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Beautiful Music
","It's a love story and it's a war story woven into a poignant tale. Wonderfully talented actors, gorgeous scenery and a sound track worth buying (if you love the mellow mandolin and a nylon-stringed guitar). Nicholas Cage -- you are ONE VERSATILE ACTOR! GIFTED. Penny Cruz, you are gifted, and so is John Heard who played the wise doctor, as well as the rest of the cast. A winner all around. (PS: bring tissues!)",Null,3,6,19 August 2001
Any Given Sunday," good flick
","I actually liked this movie, in spite of the fact that I neither like nor watch football. It was really a movie about how a brilliant coach (Pacino) finds ways to connect with and motivate his people. He doesn't give up on his most difficult player 'the maverick' played by Foxx. Coach D'Amato puts up with a lot of crap from many factions, including the bitchy general manager (Diaz) and the unethical team doctor (Woods). But it all pays off for him while the credits are rolling (surprise ending)! The only bad part of this flick was the sound editing -- WAY TOO MUCH ambient noise constantly drowns out the dialogue. I'm looking forward to the day when the music and other 'noise' plays a back seat to dialogue instead of being in direct competition with it.",Null,0,0,8 January 2001
