Marie Antoinette," 'Marie' is a step down from the throne
","I don't know quite what to think if 'Marie Antoinette', a meandering slice of self-indulgence that tells the story of the legendary Queen's time in Versailles. Sure, I thought to myself, I must cut a period picture a bit of slack...these are long and drawn out by nature. But in its 2 long hours, never once does this film pick up an inch of momentum. Though director Sofia Coppola may have simply been trying to show the monotony of Marie's life, frankly, that doesn't translate to the screen. Watch Marie being dressed! Watch Marie at the Opera! Watch Marie select shoes, fans, and pastries to the teenybopper tune of 'I Want Candy'!But, oh the shoes! Oh, the fans! This may just be the most beautifully designed and shot movie ever. It has a sumptuous, stylized look about it that just barely kept me awake. But, as Marie learned during her tragic final years of her reign, you can't get by on beauty alone.",4,1,2,20 November 2006
Underworld," Underworld Falls Short
","Vampire and werewolf films have been successful lately, so it was only inevitable that eventually they would go mano-a-mano in a 'Blade'-esque action/horror hybrid. Lo and behold, this film features a sexy and leather-clad Kate Beckinsale as a fanged fighter who sparks a war between the werewolves (led by the snarling Michael Sheen) and the vampires (presided over by Bill Nighy, chewing the scenery as usual). For a movie that draws so heavily from the 'Blade' series, Underworld is fairly low on action, and high on talk, which would be fine if the characters didn't talk in 'Matrix'-like sci-philoso-babble. When, after an exruciatingly long buildup, push finally does come to shove, the action is served up music video style-fast, flashy, and utterly confusing. Though director Len Wiseman's insistence on using practical effects is commendable, the makeup jobs look ridiculous, especially those of the werewolves, who look about as advanced as 80's Yoda. This film's main saving grace is the actors. Beckinsale delivers flat dialogue ('We take the bullets out until they talk....and then.....we put them back in.') with badass appeal that transcends her tender looks. Only Shane Brolly turns in a disappointing performance, unable to settle for an American, Russian, or Irish accent, and delivering all three with equal boredom. The set design is also glorious, a convincing fusion of old and new. Underworld has potential. It fullfills some of it, but could have been so much more. I liked this one just enough to anticipate the sequel.",5,0,2,11 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Not At Wit's End Quite Yet
","Let's start off with this. It's not that bad. There's the basic summary. Now for the long version....I walked into this film worried about it. Would it sink to the unbelievable low of 'Spider-Man 3', or would it be a fine, flavorful piece of entertainemnt, ala 'Shrek the Third'? It turns out this threequel winds up somewhere in between those two films on my list. 'At World's End' is not nearly as cringeworthy as Spidey, but it lacks the special sauce that make the Shrek threequel such a great summer surprise. The main problem is the plot. This film picks up where the last one left off, with the crew of the Black Pearl hunting for Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, carrying the film as usual), who is trapped in a strange purgatory full of crabs (hey, I don't make this stuff up). It's an interesting idea that gives FX greats ILM plenty opportunity to dream up plenty of eye candy, but the fact that Depp doesn't appear for the entire first quarter of the film hurts the story's momentum greatly. Instead, we are treated to more of the semi-romance between Keira Knightley and Orblando-scuse me, Orlando Bloom, and the introduction of a disappointing new baddie, Sao Feng (Chow-Yun Fat, whose spiritual demeanor does not lend itself to roles of mustache twirling villainy). When we finally do pick up with Captain Jack, it's a breath of cinematic fresh air, and, for a while, the film returns to the anything-goes, tossed-in-the-air style that made parts 1 and 2 of the series great marvels of escapism. But than, as the film reaches its final stages, it becomes a cluttered, dull heap of subplots. So much time is spent on the needless backstories of characters like Tia Dalma (an obnoxious role played with Rasta-esquire fervor by Naomi Harris) and James Norrington (Jack Davenport does what he can), that the script begins to kill of characters at random in a sloppy attempt to divert back to the main plot without leaving the many smaller stories open-ended. But for all it's storyline complexities, the film's ending practically screams 'Pirates 4!'. If one can ignore the story long enough to appreciate the other aspects of the film, they will find imaginative visuals, some strong performances, and a final action setpiece among the best ever committed to celluloid. But in a film that is part of a trilogy promising escapism, a convoluted plot shouldn't be a problem. A solid film, though the worst in the 'Pirates' trilogy.",7,0,2,27 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Spidey's webs don't stick.
","3 is a tricky number. So many franchises (The Godfather series, the X-Men Series) have fizzled in their third act. It takes a talented cast and crew and a boatload of great material to create a 'part III' that rises above the first tow, or at least matches it. It's not impossible (see the Star Wars series and the Mission Impossible series), but it's incredibly difficult. However, I had faith in my friendly neighborhood Spider-Man cast and crew. After all, how often does a sequel surpass the original film by leaps and bounds? Since the Spider-Man series practically invented the new concept of the popcorn-film-with-heart, I had no reason to believe that director Sam Raimi and his talented ensemble would fail me. After all, with Stan Lee's brilliant comic books, there was no way that this film could run out of material. Ironically enough, that's exactly what brings down 'Spider-Man 3'. This film suffers from the horrible 'more is better' philosophy that I hoped and prayed was above Raimi and Co. Three villains! A new love interest! More action! More pointless web-swinging set to that ubiquitous Danny Elfman theme. More, more, more! But more is not better, as the audience quickly discovers. Sure, the cast is reliable, as usual (Bruce Campbell deserves special mention in a hysterical cameo). But what 'Spider-Man 3' lacks is the witty, wondrous script that carried the first two films. Raimi, a brilliant director, decides to try his hand at screen writing this time around, and boy, does he blow it. Villains are given huge, lengthy set-up scenes, and then pushed aside until they are needed for the balls-to-the wall finale. The love scenes feel bland and bloated. And the heart of the story-Peter's battle with his own dark desires-plays out more like Jim Carrey's 'The Mask' than a serious drama. Even the action scenes suffer under Raimi's pen-the finale, with Spidey trying to save MJ, who dangles precariously off the edge of a building in a taxicab, is blatantly ripped of from part 1's climactic battle. But the worst atrocity of this film is the dialogue. Sample line? 'I like being bad. It makes me happy.' 'Nuff said. If this summer of threequels continues in the vein of 'Spider Man 3', then it will be a very disappointing summer, indeed.",4,3,6,6 May 2007
Knocked Up," 'Knocked Up' Gives Birth to A Great Movie
","Knocked Up just may be the best film of the year. Why? Because it blends laughs (some of the funniest scenes in modern movie history) with drama (unsappy and heartfelt) better than any other movie in '07. You already know the plot. Ben (Seth Rogen, a breakout), a jobless slob, gets Allison (Katharine Heigl), a corporate ladder-climber, preggy. Hilarity ensues, as does thought, heart, and beauty. If you look through the maze of sex scenes and F-bombs, there are actually lessons to be learned from this film. Admittedly, this is more of a guy's movie, but with great leading performances, hysterical celebrity cameos, and a superb soundtrack by Loudon Wainwright, the ladies will want to stick around as well.",10,0,2,23 June 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Attend the tale
","Every pitfall this film could have fallen in-and were there ever plenty of pitfalls readily awaiting Tim Burton and his devoted cast and crew-it skillfully avoids. It's tragedy about the titular barber (Johnny Depp), who teams up with a local baker (Helena Bonham Carter) to seek vengeance on a malicious judge (Alan Rickman). It's also a musical, and make no bones about it; everyone sings. I would venture to say that over 3/4 of the story is told in song. But if all you Broadway-haters can get past the singing, you'll find a brilliantly crafted movie with heart and wit to spare. The performers are all spot on; Depp and Bonham Carter both give their characters a complete makeover (vocals included), and it works superbly. Rickman tucks into a role only he could play. And the assorted newcomers in supporting roles will be the bigshots of tomorrow-especially the gifted Jamie Campbell Bower. Production design and editing are top-notch, too. Oh, and for the slasher fans; wait patiently; the stuff doesn't really start spraying until the corpse-tastic finale, and boy, does it spray. For those who want to see a nice, tidy movie to fall in love with; 'PS I Love You' came out this Friday as well. For those looking for a genre-bending oddity brought to faithful, glorious life on screen, the Demon Barber is waiting.",9,6,10,21 December 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," 'Prada' Dresses to Impress
","Starbucks coffee on her desk before her (unscheduled) arrival. The latest fashions tailored to her liking. Such is the life of Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), fashion magazine editor. The Devil Wears Prada tells the darkly funny tale of her naive assistant, Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), who is drawn into the unforgiving world of modeling. Meryl Streep doesn't steal this movie, she IS this movie. Giving the first Oscar-worthy turn of 06, Streep, giving a riotous performance that stays in your head long after the rest of the movie evaporates from your memory. Hathaway gives a good, believable performance as the lead. Emily Blunt is hilarious and Adrian Grunier his scruffy self in supporting roles. I only wish the ending weren't wrapped in cookie-cutter clichés. Overall, an enjoyable break from the rush of the summer movie season. As Meryl Streep says, in her quietest, snarkiest, Priestliest voice; 'That is all.'",8,0,0,28 July 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Good Baby Good
","Ben Affleck has a lot riding on this movie, but he couldn't have backed a better horse for his directorial debut- combine his smart, sharp approach to film with the Boston flavored sewer poetry of author Dennis Lehane, and you have a match made in heaven. Affleck colors this missing persons thriller with a local flair, the kind of down and dirty authenticity that 'The Departed' reached for but missed. He also proves his skill with directing actors-uniformly excellent actors like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris give some of their best performances here, and up and comers Casey Affleck and Amy Ryan give some of the strongest, bravest performances in modern movie history. Still, Ben-Ben's first try behind the camera is flawed-the second act sags into a series of script beats and serious speechifying, and he makes the mistake of having Casey provide a few condescending, awkwardly placed voice-overs that had me scratching my head. But for a first try, Mr. Affleck has done better than many-he has crafted what is, for the most part, a powerful thriller with a wrenching ending that will have you talking. Is it perfect? No. But it's absolutely worth your time.",8,2,6,28 October 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," The 'Little' Movie That Could
","Each summer has a breakout film. With the exception of the inspired absurdity of 'Napoleon Dynamite', as well as the delicious charm of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding', I have loathed most of them. 'March of the Penguins?' Dull. 'Bend It Like Beckham?' Duller. But this is an indie I can truly stand behind, a dark comedy with wit and energy to spare. A cluster of semi-stars (Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin), bring the cardboard characters to breathing, believable life. 'Sunshine' takes a look at the lives of the Hoovers-a sex-obsessed grandpa (Alan Arkin), a calm and reasonable mother (Toni Collette), a suicidal Proust scholar (Steve Carrell), a snobby motivational speaker dad (Greg Kinnear), a silent teen (Paul Dano), and a giggly child (Abigal Breslin), who is competing to be the Little Miss Sunshine of the title. So they all set off in a microbus to reach California. Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris give the movie pizazz, but Michael Arndt's script is the real success here. The running gags (the microbus's fault engine) work well, as does the dialogue. The actor's really are enjoying themselves here, especially Carrell and Dano, and the poppy score by Devotchka is excellent. Little Miss Sunshine is a surreal (and frighteningly realistic) comedy, and the most refreshing movie of the summer.",8,4,8,12 August 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Summer's Big Disappointment
","Sure, I have given other summer releases worse reviews (see 'My Super-Ex Girlfriend'), but X3: The Last Stand is truly the summer's biggest disappointment. The first two X-Men films were highly enjoyable thrill rides in the hands of Bryan Singer (Superman Returns). They both set up the Dark Phoenix arc, a chilling tragedy that is the true heart of the X-Men comics. The transforming of kind telepath Jean Grey (Famke Jannesen) into a cold, calculated killer is an emotionally fragile story, and one that falls to pieces in the hands of Bret Ratner. Yes, it's clichÃ© to blame the guy behind the Rush Hour films blew this movie, but he did. Bryan Singer juggled social consciousness with popcorn fun effortlessly. But Ratner switches gracelessly between the two. A plot point about a 'cure' for the mutant 'disease' quickly loses all meaning and becomes a metaphor for homosexuality. The action setpieces are constant, yet none of them are truly memorable. The final battle is an overcrowded bore, and the movie rushes the story to a forced conclusion. The rock and redeemer of this movie is the ensemble cast. All the X-Men (and women) fit well into their respective parts, no matter how brief they are. John Powell's score is a sweeping addition to the film as well. Overall, X-Men: The Last Stand is crammed full of plot, but at the same time, running on empty.",5,1,1,25 July 2006
Shrek the Third," 'Third' is first in line this summer
","When I walked into my local movie theater to see 'Shrek the Third', I was in a state of depression about the summer movie season. That meandering mess called 'Spider-Man 3' instilled within me the belief that this would be a summer of prequels with disappointing content and big box office numbers. So needless to say, I was prepared for another letdown in a summer that seemed as if it would be full of 'em. Guess not. From the second the film's opening title rolled, 'Shrek The Third' broke my state of pessimism about the summer movie season and reminded me what a great popcorn film should be...side-splitting comedy, high drama, larger-than-life action, and a little romance thrown in for good measure. Mike Myers is back as Shrek, who, due to a tragic turn of events, is slated to become king of Far Far Away. Desperate to stick the crown on someone else's head, Shrek embarks on a journey to find Arthur Pendragon (Justin Timberlake, who, no, is not really that bad of an actor), the only other heir to the throne. Joining Shrek, of course, are Donkey (Eddie Murphy, hilarious as usual) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas, having the time of his life), although he does leave Fiona (Cameron Diaz, also enjoying herself) behind. Like 'Shrek 2', this film is a mishmash of little-kid humor (haha, he farted!) and pop-culture nonsequiturs (a 'Just Say Nay' program, a chorus of frogs singing 'Live and Let Die'). And, like 'Shrek 2', the folks at Dreamworks Animation have created a marvel that is a refreshing antidote to the typical Hollywood film. 'Shrek the Third' brings back lovable characters (Julie Andrews as the Queen of Far Far Away, Rupert Everett as the evil Prince Charming) and introduces great new ones (Eric Idle as a nutty Merlin, Cheri Oteri as Sleeping Beauty). It manages to hew to the formula that has made the other films so popular while still seeming fresh, relevant, and witty. Not the best of the three, but it certain holds it's own among parts 1 and 2. If this is an indication of the rest of the summer, maybe it ain't so bad after all.",9,3,11,20 May 2007
The Illusionist," A beautiful film, but the emotion seems to have vanished!
","I could try to explain this movie about a Viennese magician who woos his childhood sweetheart, while mixing it up with Eurocops, royalty, and a greedy stage manager, but it wouldn't do much good. In fact, I am not sure I get the movie. Edward Norton keeps this film afloat, give a suble, yet raw performance as said magician, and Paul Giamatti is clearly enjoying himself as the Chief Eurocop. The writers of this film also deserve huzzahs, for creating the most head-scratching ending since 'The Usual Suspects'. And, as expected of a period film, it sure does look pretty.So what else is great about this film? Not much. Trust me, I am a fan of period epics, but this one moves along at a snail's pace, expecting you to give your attention while the filmakkers set up the plot for 90 minutes, because, after all, it'll all be worth it in the end....right? A great ending is no excuse for the fact that the rest of the film feels high on its self-importance, and steeped in its own 'majesty'. There isn't a ton of potential here, so director Neil Burger does what he can with the mediocre script. Eventually, the picture gains suspense and momentum, but like a bad magic trick, it's too little, too late.",7,1,1,3 September 2006
Transformers," 'Transformers' a robotic thrill ride
","SYNOPSIS: Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeouf) and his crush, Mikaela (Megan Fox) find themselves caught in the midst of a security crisis involving shape shifting androids. Based on the popular toy line. PROS: The biggest pro of this movie are the Transformers themselves. Designed by ILM, these robots go beyond the typical sci-fi cinema eye-candy and become convincing creations that are up there with 'Pirates' Davy Jones as some of the best CGI creations ever to grace the silver screen. Shia Labeouf also does an excellent job. The whole movie rests on his shoulders, and he makes it work. Also great is the fact that this film never takes itself too seriously. Director Michael Bay and Co. understand the humor in the story, and thus produce some great laughs. CONS: My biggest problem with this movie is the fact that it was shot in a gritty, hand-held-camera style that doesn;t fit the story. Instead of adding extra intensity, it just make the viewer dizzy. Also, there are a few moments of Michael Bay excess, some unintentionally hilarious lines, and some annoyingly blatant product placements. Overall, Transformers is a big, brassy blast that is best viewed on the big screen.",8,1,3,6 July 2007
World Trade Center," The Year's Best Film, HANDS DOWN.
","Sure, Oscar season hasn't hit just yet, but I am confident when I say that 'World Trade Center' is the year's best movie. I say this as a critic with utter disdain for both Nicolas Cage, and a growing disappointment in Oiver Stone's work ever since 'Natural Born Killers'. Cage shines here, and Stone redeems himself. From that wrenching shot of a giant airplane silhouette snaking down a city street, Stone grabs you and never lets you go. He cuts no corners, showing, graphically and wrenchingly, the 9/11 terrorist attacks effect on the community. Burning papers fly everywhere. Subways, once full of activity, are now empty. Police officers return to the station, drenched in blood and shaken to the core. Although the film examines the world's reaction to the attacks, it's main focus is on Officers Mcgloughin and Jimeno, who were trapped under the rubble of the World Trade Center buildings after the attack. Stone wisely chooses to darken the surroundings, train the camera on the men's soot-caked faces, and just let them emote. It's an approach that would have bombed with many actors, but Cage and Michael Pena are up to the challenge, letting their eyes tell the story, trading monosyllabic encouragements as they try to escape the metal and rock pinning them to the floor. A subplot focuses on the wives of the 'First Responders', and manages to be both wrenching and uplifting at the same time. Magge Gylenhall in particular deserves Oscar attention for her turn as Mrs. Jimeno. This movie is a superb piece of work, and you owe it to yourself to see it.",10,5,12,3 September 2006
The Insider," Deep 'Insider'
","Where would the filmakking without Michael Mann? The notoriously detail-oriented director has crafted such masterpieces as 'Heat' and 'Collateral', which transcend mere bullet operas and turn instead into wrenchingly violent character studies. However, in 'The Insider', to quote Peter Travers, 'the characters shed no blood, only principles.' A young Russell Crowe beefs up and grays down to play Jeffrey Wigand, and ex-Big Tobacco exec who wants to go on national TV and blow the whistle on some of his company's darker practices. 60 Minutes supervisor Lowell Bergman (a fiery Pacino, who gives an excellent performance, although bearing no resemblance to the real Bergman)fights to get Wigand on the air, while the CBS Brass, along with veteran reporter Mike Wallace (Chritopher Plummer)do their best to kill the story, fearing a lawsuit. Mann turns a real-life newsroom battle into a pulse-pounding thriller, complete with a tense score by Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke, and superb cimenatography by the great Dante Spinotti. If you want a single scene that showcases all of this, I'll give you one; Wigand golfs at night, and is threatened by a Big Tobacco worker. By blurring the world around him and shooting the driving range in ominous greens and blacks, Mann gives us a look inside Wigand's indecision, anger, and isolation. Wow. This is one of the best films of the 90's.",9,2,3,7 February 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," 'Phoenix' Casts Its Spell
","SYNOPSIS: Harry Potter and co. discover The Order of the Phoenix, a secret society bent on stopping the Dark Lord's reign of terror. Meanwhile, the students of Hogwarts grapple with an oppressive new female teacher, Dolores Umbridge. PROS: This is quite simply the film of the summer. Director David Yates fits this series like a glove. He pulls no punches when delivering the darker aspects of the story, but makes sure to add plenty of humor and heart as well. The cast is uniformly excellent as usual. Old hands like Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are note-perfect in their roles, while newcomers like Evanna Lynch and Helena Bonham Carter deliver memorable performances as well. Deserving special mention is Imelda Staunton, who plays Dolores Umbridge, a perky professor with dark political motivations. In a film with a cast for the ages, she steals the show. The behind the scenes crew isn't slacking off either-cinematography, music, and special effects are all leaps and bounds ahead of the previous Potter films. And screenwriter Michael Goldenberg trims the fat of the 870-page book, leaving us with a lean, mean, emotional roller-coaster of a film. CONS: No huge qualms. Sure, some fan favorites (Dobby) are dropped, but when you have a book this big, who cares. My only really (very small) problem with the film is that the Mr. Weasley subplot could have used a bit more time. Overall, the best of all five Potter flicks, and a fantasy film on par with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. David Yates is the best thing ever to happen to the HP series. Bravo.",10,2,5,11 July 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Ain't No Masterpiece
","Starring Tom Hanks. Directed by Ron Howard. With Alfred Molina and Ian Mckellen. A movie with credits like that should be an embarrassment of riches. Instead it's a talky cloak-and-dagger chase film, interspersed with jerky flashbacks and faulty accents.By now, most people know the plot. Tom Hanks headlines as Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor asked to solve the murder of a Louvre curator. The curator has left a series of clues, written in blood, that lead Langdon, along with cute tag-along Sophie Neveu (Tatou, struggling with her first major English role) to uncover a vast conspiracy. Oh, but it's not just any conspiracy. This cover-up involves a Catholic sect (Molina hams it up as a sinister bishop), an Albino assassin (played with quiet menace by Paul Bettany), a crippled history buff (Mckellen, excellent as usual), and a shocking secret hidden in DaVinci's 'The Last Supper'. The book, heavy on history and light on action, was great in small doses. But a non-stop 150 minutes spent listening to Hanks describe the time of Christ amounts to a much less enjoyable experience. The film never shakes from its somber tone, and director Howard tries to cut down on the talking by using grainy flashbacks that look like a high school production of Hamlet. Devotees of the book will find this a forgettable thriller that stays faithful to its source. Everyone else will be let down by a great director and a great cast, who produce an average film.",4,6,13,29 May 2006
The Fountain," 'The Fountain' runs dry, but gets by on visuals
","'The Fountain' is a good date movie. Because, when you see it with a date, you can assume the role of 'intellectuals', and produce good conversation about the 'hiddean meanings' and 'sweeping allegories' behind this surprisingly linear, straightforward movie. With 'Pi', director Darren Aronofsky burst onto the scene. He is admittedly is an incredible talent with a deliciously oddball imagination, which is unfortunately is colossal disappointment. Aronofsky's dream project, the story of three characters (all played by Hugh Jackman) from three different time periods, who are searching for a miracle to save the one they love (all played by Aronofsky partner Rachel Weisz), was cut to ribbons by the studio, who sliced the budget and edited the film. This is supposed to be a thinking man's sci-fi movie, ala '2001' or 'Solaris', but instead, it just heaps on layers of 'complexity' so that you will come out of the movie with a feeling that the filmmakers pulled a fast one on you, when in fact the story is ridiculously simple. The acting is excellent. Ellen Burtsyn is Oscar-worthy as Jackman's boss, and Weisz infuses all of her characters with layers of heart and soul. As for Jackman, he gives an engrossing performance, and keeps a straight face during the movies final quarter, during which he ascends towards the stars in the lotus position, concealed in a giant bubble with only a dying tree for company. The film also looks magnificent, with luscious cinematography by Matthew Libatique. The score by Clint Mansell and prog rockers Mogwai is beautiful. But all the well-done odds and ends still add up to an average film. Maybe we will get Aronofsky's cut on DVD. Until then, this one is not worth your time.",5,2,6,23 November 2006
There Will Be Blood," Trouble, Toil and Oil
","Whether 'There Will Be Blood' is any good to you at all depends on whether or not you enjoy watching greedy people mastermind the undoing of other greedy people. Think of 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead', but with an extra glaze of acid laid on thick. The movie is hard to watch, and its emotional high points are moments of unbearable tension, slimy avarice, and nervous, squirming laughter. If this is the kind of thing you enjoy (I admit I do), than be all means, this is your movie. This one will also appeal to even the most casual fan of Daniel Day-Lewis, who gives a performance so earth-shaking that it renders all possible adjectives limp. As oilman Daniel Planview, Lewis creates not a man but a creature with human flaws-here is a thing that sees every facet of life in terms of what he stands to gain. It's alternately fascinating and horrifying to watch an ensemble of money-grubbers fight amongst themselves to earn the favor of Plainview, who is in turn ardently working to repel them along with the rest of humanity. In the finale, when Plainview decides to throw aside the inconveniences of law and religion to fight his battle for self-absorbed isolation, Lewis elevates a series of already good scenes to classic status. This is also your cup of tea of you like to pick apart and argue about your film fare. For example: if Plainview is working so hard to cast off the personal experience and stock up on materialism, then why do we have a scene in which Plainview shoots a stack of his recent purchases? Are even material things a burden to him? What is his definition of freedom? What is any man's definition of freedom? See! Great discussion movie. The Wrap Up: This one is for fans of: Feel-bad cinema, Daniel-Day Lewis, discussion movies This one is not for: Fans of uplift and sentimentality, impatient filmgoers, squeamish audiences. I thought: While the film sometimes sags into its own whacko zone, and the fat needed some trimming in places, this is the kind of bold, volcanic film that defines the word 'originality'. Definitely worth a look. B+",9,2,6,16 January 2008
American Gangster," 'Gangster' hands out the good stuff
","'Anerican Gangster', the new Ridley Scott film about 70's drug titan Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) and the rogue cop Richie Roberts(Russell Crowe) who tried to put him behind bars, is a strange phenomena. It is, in different respects, one of the years greatest sucesses and most devastating disappointments. Let's start with the triumphs-the actors are dynamite. Viewers who want to see great thespians do their thing are in for a big treat here. Denzel is a fiery wonder as Lucas, and Crowe deserves a lot more appreciation than he's getting for his quieter, more tortured performance as a cop who has nothing left but the job. Even the supporting cast, be they infamous flop-makers like Cuba Gooding, Jr, or renowned character actors such as Armand Assante, turn in superb, note perfect performances. And Ruby Dee steals the movie as Lucas's elderly, principled mother. Behind the scenes, no expense is spared. The New York streets look delicilously ratty, the period music is catchy, and the cinematography brings a great clarity to the ups and downs of gangster life. The biggest disappointment is in the script. Steve Zaillian has written an epic, almost 3-hour script, but it comes down to a lot of 'and then this happens..oh, and next...'. Almost no character insight is given, no significant action driven by anything other than the desire to make money. And the build-up is agonizingly slow. 'Gangster' has some classic scenes, but none of them can be attribute to the script, nor to Scott's clunky direction (I won't start on my personal opinions of this director). Still, definitely worth a look-when Crowe and Washington clash, you get the best-acted moment in movies since 'Heat''s coffeeshop scene.",8,0,3,18 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," 'Stranger', but not better
","Call it 'I Heart Huckabees' for the average moviegoer. 'Stranger Than Fiction' is a trippy dramedy about a drab IRS auditor Harold Crick ((Will Ferell), who discovers his life is being written for him, by uber-successful author Karen Eiffel (the hilarious Emma Thompson), which would be great were it not for the fact that she unwittingly plan to kill him off. Thus begins the quest to find the reclusive Ms. Eiffel and convince to alter the story. Crick is aided by a looney lit professor (Dustin Hoffman), and a rebellious tax-evading baker who he falls in love with. Sound strange enough? The script was fought for among the Hollywood suits, but I can't see why. Sure it's a modestly entertaining existential piece, ala 'Eternal Sunshine', but not nearly the same caliber. The acting is excellent. The soundtrack is awesome (in my humble opinion, Spoon is the best rock band on Earth). The cinematography is beautiful. But ironically for such a sought after script, 'Fiction' stumbles because of its writing. At times, the story becomes too trippy for its own good, trying to beat us over the head with its indie 'smartness' and 'everything's connected' storytelling that has become in vogue since 'Crash' took home Best Picture. The story is fun and poignant until the end, where it trips over itself, trying messily to make ends meet and spoiling what began as a lot of fun. This film is worth watching, just rent it so you can turn it off before the final 20 minutes. Create your own ending. It will be better than the real one.",6,1,5,11 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," 'Die Hard' Lives Again
","SYNOPSIS: John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back as he teams up with a clean-cut computer expert (Justin Long) to take down a hacker (Timothy Olyphant) bent on causing havoc in Washington D. C. on Independence Day. ----PROS: Of all the sequels, prequels, and remakes Hollywood has dumped into cinemas this summer, this one is definitely the most fun. Willis and Long develop an amusing relationship full of sly, snappy dialogue. And of course, this wouldn't be a DH movie without the action. The fight sequences surpass anything in the first three films (or almost any action movie, for that matter). The convincing blend of stunts and CG gives the explosive action a burst of adrenaline missing from, say, Spidey 3.---- CONS: The plot, of course, is absurd. That's to be expected with Die Hard movies, but even for a guy's flick, the story is ridiculous. But once the bang-bang and boom-boom begin, the movie (luckily) loses sigh of the story. Also, Timothy Olyphant was not much of a bad guy. He wasn't in any way menacing or evil. But overall, if you just dial your brain down to the lowest level, and sit back with a big bag of popcorn, you can't help but have a helluva time at this flick.",9,1,4,3 July 2007
300," '300' is a lucky number
","'This is MADNESS!' shouts a crony who looks suspiciously like Djimon Honsou.'Madness?' says King Leonidas (a hearty Gerard Butler) 'This is SPARTA!!' At this point, encouraged by his wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey,who steals the film from her male co-stars, Leonidas shoves the crony, along with a handful of other low-level baddies, into a huge, deep well to the thundering tune of heavy-metal music. OK, so in the course of history, that probably didn't happen. But wouldn't it be cooler if it did? That's the approach '300' takes, and, in this case, it works. Taken from a comic book by Frank Miller, who puts the 'graphic' in 'graphic novel', 300 is the tale of 300 Spartans who attempt to defend their land from 250,000 Persians. Sure, you've heard the against all odds story, but not like this, From the opening scene, which shows a young Leonidas battling a wolf in a narrow cave, I knew this movie would be unlike any other. The look of the film is indescribable, a delicious mix of CGI and real location in a way that they have never been mixed before. Every scene holds hundreds of visual wonders. This is without a doubt the best looking film in modern history. However, '300' is not without it's flaws. A subplot about a weak hunchback (Andrew Tiernan) who is spurned by Leonidas falls flat. The leader of the Persian Army, an effeminate and self-aggrandizing warlord named Xerxes, is played by a miscast Rodrigo Santoro, whose voice is artificially (and obviously) deepened. And the speechifying is just plain awful ('Eat your breakfast, Spartans. For tonight, we dine in hell!'). But Director Zack Snyder, his small troupe of actors, and his army of post-production whiz-kids have accomplished a visual miracle like no other before it. '300' heralds the arrival of a strange and wonderful new kind of film-making.",8,2,6,19 March 2007
Atonement," Nothing to 'Atone' For
","'Atonement' is a rarity; the prestige-slathered Oscar treat that, far from being driven by look-at-me desperation, is both watchable and commendable. The story is epic, but Joe Wright moves along Ian McEwan's epic of childish lies (the child being the radiant Saoirse Ronan) and adult war (waged, both socially and on the frontlines, by soldier James McAvoy and nurses Keira Knightley and, playing an adult version of Ronan, Romola Garai) with the precision and clarity of a diamond cutter. The acting is all around top-notch; with the performances being that of McAvoy and Vanessa Redgrave (playing an even older version of Garai). Both have a moment or two where there character turns the film around, and they both manage to do it not only without looking ridiculous, but with a simple, clipped poignancy that lends the film an edge of raw emotion. This movie, however, is driven by behind the scenes workers. Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey (robbed come Oscar time!) has created an incomparable visual feast of the kind not seen since the hey-day of David Lean or Stanley Kubrick, and Dario Marinelli creates a brilliant, moving score. Sure, occasionally the movies reach exceeds its grasp-the war scenes never do cut deep enough- but who cares when the grasp is so bold and ingeniously constructed? Atonement is a flawed but impeccable gem in the crown of a great, great year for movies.",10,7,12,1 March 2008
V for Vendetta," One of the year's best
","Excellent. Plain and simple. The story is that of a terrorist, V (An Oscar nod is in order for Hugo Weaving), who drags a civilian (Natalie Portman, pulling off a convincing British accent) into his guerilla war with a totalitarian government. The many taboos (abusive priests, gay sex) that are brought up in the film service the story, as opposed to simply fueling a political fire. The fights are directed with panache by James Mcteigue, who makes a first rate debut, and the set design is appropriately gloomy. The soundtrack carries the film, and it manages to have a beating heart beneath the political propaganda. V gets my vote.",9,4,8,31 July 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," 'O Brother' is righteous
","The Coen Brothers may just be cinema's greatest crackpot auteurs-they deliver sly, ironic stories that generally consist of several weird and wild subplots that all collide in an ending that always leaves a few loose ends for the audience to ponder. Bless them. In the midst of the blockbusters franchises and hipster road movies, seeing a Coen Brothers movie is like inhaling a breath of fresh air. This one is no exception. 'O Brother Where Art Thou' is an adaptation of Homer's sprawling Greek tragedy 'The Odyssey', retold in a new setting-Dustbowl-era Mississippi. George Clooney stars as Ulysses Everett McGill, a slick, suave greaseball of a man who was arrested for practicing law without a license. When he hears that his wife(Holly Hunter)is getting re-married to another man (the hysterical Ray McKinnon), Ulysses busts loose from a chain gang to set things right. However, he must drag along the two men who are chained to him; violent, confused Peter (John Turturro) and ditsy, dim Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson is witty without being one-dimensional). Along the way, the Coen Brothers find time to pack in a run-in with real-life criminal Babyface Nelson, a group of bewitching she-devils, a huge flood, and a KKK rally attended by a hopeful politician and a malicious one-eyed Bible salesman (John Goodman plays him with what could only be described as beastly allure). Through it all, the film (photographed ravishingly by Roger Deakins) is set to a glorious soundtrack of roots music. John Hart, Chris Thomas King and Allison Krauss all deliver excellent tracks, but the real highlight is when Clooney and his co-horts burst into a toe-tapping version of 'Man of Constant Sorrow', not for the sake of the plot, but for pure enchantment. And that's what 'Brother' is all about-not story (although it has a great one), but serving up a great slice of unadulterated folksy bliss.",9,5,5,8 April 2007
