Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Actually Really Good
","Good Story line, great graphics. Decent representation of Lincoln during the serious parts even though it was obviously fictitious. Suspend your disbelief for 2 hours and enjoy it. If you like Sci Fi Fantasy Vampire flicks, you will enjoy this.I thought the lead portraying Lincoln looked convincing as the President and all of support characters did well. The acting was top notch and they built great relationships and the action was nicely done. The one knock I would give this movie was the over the top cgi stunts like jumping from horse to horse but other than that it was great.",9,2,6,17 October 2012
American Beauty," Bizarre and in Bad Taste
","I was surprised to read a comment here about how great this movie was. Were we watching the same movie? The sheer domestic violence, the peeping tom and the drugs were bad enough. What bothered me the most was the constant hostile nature this movie had the whole time. Then the crazy neighbor ex-marine who abused that boy who liked Jane and then tried to have sex later in the film with Jane's Father? Just when you think some sanity will enter the story as the father looks at a picture of the family lovingly, he is shot in the head by the mother. This movie was completely disturbing and bad for the viewers mindset. I give 2 stars only because the father stopped himself from having sex with his Daughter's virgin friend.",2,1,2,21 June 2006
Arrival," Slow and Boring
","The show just lumbered along and along, we were sure it was going to get better but it never did. This whole docile quiet act that the aliens had for the entire movie was stupid as was the fact that some idiot would go against them and they would do nothing. The fact that they looked like they had no agility in their 'hands' but they built these awesome advanced ships but they look like Octopi. Then the whole thing with Amy Adams just figuring out these circles in just a few weeks time and by the end she is basically communicating without assistance like yeah right. Then the worst part, you are actually happy for five minutes when she convinces the world what she knows and you expect some kind of cool climax with the aliens and they just fly away. Shoot to the scene where Amy Adams has some kind of flashback about her family and the movie is over. We want our money and 2 hours back.",1,9,17,2 January 2017
