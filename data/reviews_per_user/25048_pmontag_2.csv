Lucky Number Slevin," Really Stupid ...
","Wow, what a dumb movie. Literally everything about it is exactly wrong. The acting, the cinematography, the sound, the writing, it's all bad. Why oh why oh why was Harnett in a towel for 40 minutes and why oh why oh why was it so irritating to see him eating a sandwich with bread that white. Ugh, I'm shivering.The dialogue in this thing, are you kidding. This movie feels like a cross between Tarantino and that young guy who was in Die Hard 4 and who's in those techie computers. The result: Annoying! How could I possibly care for Slevin in this movie. The sensibility where the 'good guy' won't take any lip from the bad guy and is instead a 'conundrum' does nothing to make me ally with him, to care about what happens to him. And I don't blame just the actor - this is also the directing.The way they use sound in this movie can be insulting, too, along with the editing. Well, what isn't most concerning here is how bad this movie is, but it's the high reviews its getting, for the most part. Oh, man, I give up ...",1,3,14,20 February 2008
Juno," I don't quite understand all the hype ...
","At the screening of Juno I went to at the Uptown theater in Minneapolis, it was a packed house and an usher introduced the movie at the front of the theater, saying 'everybody, you're in for an awesome movie; it's so good. When you leave the theater, please exit at the front due to the large crowd.'Throughout the movie, the theater was laughing pretty hard and was moved throughout. Now, I don't want to come down too hard on this movie and make such a fuss that I come off as a negative, hateful person. Anyone who spends all the hard work making a movie is then up for criticism by those who see it and you hope that everyone involved is aware of sensibility issues and that it's okay for some people not to like their movie if they're being honest.And that's just it, if I'm being honest, the fact that Juno is garnering this much praise seems silly. But I have vast concerns that my tastes are not well suited for what the culture dictates as good. The best part of this movie, by far, is the character played by Jennifer Gardner. I think it's well written, believable and emotional. I liked Jason Bateman's character until he said rock n' roll music was at its best in 1993. Though Juno disagrees with him, it seems reasonable to conclude that the writer of this movie thinks the rock scene of 1993 is pretty good, but just not the best. Right there, this represents a lot of trouble. Rock n' roll in 1993 was disastrous compared to the times when it was good. And it only gets much worse when you hear a 16 year old girl saying things like, 'After hearing Iggy and the Stooges do Raw Power, everything else sounds precious in comparison.' This 16 year old girl sounds like a 28 year old man throughout the movie. And why do kids or high schoolers have to be such smart asses in the movies these days. I think it translates annoyingly to the screen.What happens in Juno has been happening too much in the cinema of the past couple decades - there are too many dialogue scenes about what people's tastes are like - Tarantino may get the award for this. And where does all this come from? Maybe Woody Allen? I don't know for sure, but I like it a lot better when I go to a movie and visit a place that's engaging and emotional. I think the dialogue-driven, here's what I like, hipster speech types of approaches make for movies that real movie-lovers are not going to like.I don't think a movie like Juno is really a movie. It's a TV show. It's meant to be watched on that smaller screen in your house. Obviously, I'm in the minority opinion because everyone seems to like this movie, and this adds one more reason as to why I do feel pretty alone a lot of the time on this planet.",3,39,82,24 January 2008
