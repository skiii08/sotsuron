First Man," This is a good movie
","I would give First Man a 9 out of 10 (an outstanding film, better than most of the other films released in 2018), only if we can agree that The Right Stuff should be about 15. It's beautifully shot and an extremely intense first-person account. Claire Foy is incredible. It simply lacked much of the excitement that films like The Right Stuff had locked down.",9,0,1,8 January 2019
