Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Boring and plotless
",Yes I know it is the beginning to a story. I still hated the thing. The movie was more of a show of what Lucas can do with his FX but there was no substance to the story. It was long and dragged on. It would have been good if he spent more time working on a good story.,Null,0,1,10 April 2000
Army of Darkness," Blood Guts and Fun!
",This movie is great if your in the mood to laugh. Yeah it's a bit sick and twisted but none the less it is a lot of fun to watch. The out-of-date special effects make this movie all the better. The story is great and the acting is a great.Highly recommended for a date movie.,Null,1,1,10 April 2000
