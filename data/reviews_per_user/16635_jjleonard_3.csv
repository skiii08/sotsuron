Ford v Ferrari," Great action
","Great characters, great action, awesome insight into a ruthless rivalry. Well worth watching - insightful and entertaining.",8,1,3,10 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What a drag
",Nothing happens for 2 hours and 10 minutes! And then absolute ungratuitous violence without any rhyme or reason. What a waste of 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life. Tarantino is not to be trusted especially after the droning pointless dialogue of the hateful 8. I will be sceptical about any of his future output. As a long standing fan I am disappointed.,3,4,6,8 December 2019
Joker," Overhyped
","Really expected much more. Nothing entertaining, disruptive or breathtaking. Somewhat predictable (the relationship with the neighbour) and left me wanting at the end.",4,5,18,8 December 2019
