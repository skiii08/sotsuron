Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for a Heavyweight was 20 times bettter
","I'll give it this much; it wasn't boring. But.. This movie told me absolutely nothing that I didn't already know. If you get addicted to dangerous drugs, you will end up in a bad way.  Thanks for the tip, McGruff. It is a grim, gross depressing film about a pack of losers WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN LOSERS EVEN IF THEY HAD NEVER DONE DRUGS. You might have made it more appetizing if drugs had ruined the lives of some people who had a single good quality in the first place. The directing is really artsy and conceited and my brethren, I saw all this avant-garde cinemo-crap in the late 60's, when many a good movie was ruined by the hippie wannabe directors using multiple screens, slow-mo audio, fuzzy hallucination sequences, rapid fire splicing, weird angles, keystone cops speed-ups and many, many other tricks. But since this film is geared to a young audience (the young characters are H-addicts who are also supposed to be somewhat hip and cool, but the old one addicted to diet pills is a total pathetic mundane ditz in the first place, and the other older characters are patently despicable) the public thinks its seeing directing innovations. The TV ad for the film called it `the most controversial film of the year?' Controversial? Like someone is out there arguing that heroin addiction is a good thing and it never ruined anyone's life.I'm sad to dislike this because some people I really respect recommended it so highly. They insisted that I had to see it, that it was the best. REQUIEM is just another downer, a cold front blown in from Canada. My wife asked me at the end of it, `So what did you think?' `What did you think,' I countered. `Well it was kind of arty.' `Yeah, I said, `That was the whole point, not the story itself. My life would have been better off if I had never seen it.'",Null,0,1,17 March 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Masterpiece
","I rented Moulin Rouge because I thought my wife would enjoy it. I was planning on just surviving the ordeal. As it turned out, I absolutely loved it. It is an artistic masterpiece. The plot was secondary to me and not to be judged at face value like plots in 30,000 other films. This was eye and ear candy, entertainment per se. I am amazed at how many reviewers absolutely hated this film. If ROUGE were judged by the plot, it is an awful and simplistic movie. But it isn't about the plot and it is a fine and sophisticated movie. The music is delicious and creative and played with a sense of humor, the songs of the 70's and 80's sung in anachronistic sarcasm and beauty.  The leading actors were good-looking without being too old or too young and smug.   The craft of directing and producing is generally overrated. Any nit-wit actor with a lot of clout and money can become one. For once we see a film that is so complex in its art form and brilliantly conceived and executed that the run of the mill actor turned director could not have pulled it off in his or her wildest dreams. I hated to return MOULIN ROUGE to the store and may actually buy it on dvd. However I don't want to watch all the behind the scenes features. I want to always enjoy it in its pure form. The sets,(especially the model of Paris) are wonderful. Hoo-ray for this movie! By the way, I really enjoyed reading the people who rip it to shreds on the IMDB. What a subjective industry!",Null,5,7,10 April 2002
Hoosiers," Hoopla
","Isn't diversity wonderful? Isn't it nice to know that there are all kinds of people in this world, each with different tastes and standards for what pleases them? I think so. So far every single reviewer on the IMDB has absolutely loved this movie. They all think it is an amazing feel-good masterpiece. Not one killjoy has yet to show up and suggest that it is anything short of awesome. Well, ta-daaa, here I am. I wouldn't want to sit through this movie again for anything less than a hundred bucks. Gene Hackman is a new coach in town and for no logical reason everyone treats him like he is a leper out to blow up the school and slaughter the livestock. Okay, he overcomes all this illogical hatred and manages to shape his understaffed basketball team into a unit that will even compete for the Indiana State Championship! High School basketball is big in Indiana in 1951. 79 reporters are outside the locker room fighting to talk to the coach long before they even get to the finals!   The music is overbearing and awful. I can't even describe it. Every time they try to show us basketball action they have to include a rock/pop/muzak concert that drowns out everything. I thought the basketball scenes were totally unconvincing. I never got the sense that I was watching game action, only actors. One teenager is supposed to be the greatest basketball player in the state but he won't play anymore because his father died. That's half the plot in the movie, getting this pouting prima Donna to play. What's so great about his game? He's got a good jump shot with very little elevation on his jump. Big deal. That's ALL he's got, and with editing, there are 79,000 teen-agers in Rhode Island that can make 99% of their jump shots. The ending was a predictable as the sunrise in Tahiti and as usual, was a rip-off of THE LONGEST YARD. That's the film that initiated the slow-mo final play that all the others have copied. And YARD had a dynamite story to go along with it, unlike the snooze-plot in HOOSIERS.   Hackman is way too old to be making out with Barbara Hershey. It's the standard Hollywood casting nonsense. Of course, they hate each other when they first meet. I immediately knew they'd be necking before this flick was out. That's always the dead giveaway. I wish that reviewers would speak for themselves in their reviews. Just tell me what YOU think and we can compare notes accordingly. But please stop insisting that, `you will absolutely love this movie.' You don't know me. I did not like this move. My wife loved it. All of the others on this board loved it. And by the way, it IS fiction. The tiniest school in the state does not go on to the state championships with an undermanned squad to boot. I did like one thing. Dennis Hopper was excellent and his role as the boozer battling his problem was touching and effective. But the feel-good sports story was dopey.",Null,0,3,1 April 2002
Pulp Fiction," Pretty Good
","I enjoyed this film but some of it was drab. The first 30 minutes were not very good at all. The first speeches between Travolta and the other hit man were contrived and rigid. I didn't buy it. But it got better as it went along. It had some stimulating plot twists, especially when Bruce Willis had to decide whether or not to rescue the man who had been out to kill him ten minutes earlier. It reminds me of THE INTERLOPER by Saki, when two bitter enemies were trapped by a fallen tree and became friends, only to be rescued.... by wolves. The part about the gold watch being hidden up a man's certain area for years was supposed to be funny but I thought it was not and it ruined a plot that until then was supposed to be taken seriously. The writer makes an excellent showing as Jimmy who doesn't think his house has a certain sign on it. Bruce Willis was the best actor in this movie and that doesn't say that much for it since he isn't really the new Laurence Olivier. But PULP had some bite and some very good moments. Why don't we all respect each other and stop ripping anyone who doesn't agree with our opinions about movies? Lets stop insisting that anyone who doesn't agree with me is a moron. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, not mine. This isn't the Israel-Palestine dispute. Its movies, for crying out loud.",Null,0,1,10 April 2002
