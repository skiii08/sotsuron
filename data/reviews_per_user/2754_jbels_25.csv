Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Highs and lows
","The Phantom Menace is like a roller coaster ride with a very long climb up the first hill.  Everyone can't help being excited by the Star Wars logo and the music.  And what follows in the first fifteen minutes is visually spectacular.  But then the movie becomes awfully gabby until the pod race. Is it worth seeing?  Yes.  Worth seeing twice?  Maybe.  I now feel that the critical backlash was too harsh, and that while Lucas may have written a confusing script, he still seems humble in his desire to entertain.  My one big complaint is that the sleek, silver troopers collapse like boiled broccoli at the slightest touch--they pose no threat.  And Jar Jar Binks seemed stoned to me.  He looks like he never got out of Woodstock.  But this is worth the trip and the wait.  And it sets up for very interesting things to come.",6,0,1,19 May 1999
Training Day," Denzel deserved it and he won it!
","Denzel Washington played this role with such control and such finesse that he completely deserved the Academy Award.  (He's deserved it for practically every role he's played).  His performance is so good that after viewing it, it takes a couple of days to shake off.  Great, great great!",Null,0,11,29 January 2003
Meet the Parents," Such a great comedy
","This movie works on every level and it is so funny.  Beautifully timed with just the right mood, every performance is great.  Even DeNiro, whose comedy can be hit or miss sometimes, is perfect.  Stiller is hilarious as he brews through the whole film.  And Terry Polo is the bee's knees.  Just great, rent or own it!",Null,0,0,16 June 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," How did I manage to enjoy this?
","This movie had all the elements of something that is easy to hate--typical plot, dumb jokes--but heck if I didn't enjoy this one.  Kate Hudson pulls off an amazing feat--she take a totally unlikeable character and makes her likeable.  Hats off to Hudson for that--she saved the film.",Null,1,2,9 July 2003
Final Destination 2," Lots of gross stuff!
","Haven't seen the first one (YET!) so didn't know what to expect.  Does not disappoint in the gore department.  People are picked off in every imaginable away--squashed, pierced, sliced.  This is pretty, pretty gross.",Null,0,0,26 August 2003
Malcolm X," Coulda beena classic
","Spike Lee had all the ingredients for a Godfather-type classic but he tampered with the first third of this movie for style over substance. Basically, Lee should have stepped out of the way and let Denzel take-over. The scene where they are walking in Zoot Suits is ridiculous, and Washington is looking at Lee like a partner who does not know how to dance.  Washington is amazing while Lee is the Sophia Coppola of the movie.",Null,3,11,26 August 2003
Notting Hill," Nodding Off
","Romantic comedy is nice to look at but dull.  No real tension and too many false endings make Notting Hill lackluster.  Julia Roberts is nice to look at, but she plays, well, Julia Roberts.",5,1,2,17 May 1999
The Italian Job," The heavens parted and down came Charlize Theron
","The Italian Job is a pretty good, fast moving action film with lots of good car chases, but it is no Ronin.  Still and regardless, it could have been the worst made film in the world and I would still give it thumbs way up for the opportunity to look at the beautiful face of Charlize Theron.  Her blinding, Helen-of-Troy type beauty is overwhelming.",Null,2,4,26 August 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Linda, come back!
","Longing for the days of Linda Hamilton and those cut arms and fierce anger. I never thought of her as being 'crucial' to the Terminator movies, but now that she is gone, I realize she was, if not IS the key element to its success.",Null,0,0,14 August 2003
Apocalypse Now," One of the top war films
","This movie sucks the breath out of you when viewed on the big screen, especially in 70MM.  Redux helped it in one way (the French Quarter style house visit) and hurt it in another (the extended Playboy bunny sequence, which added nothing).  Still, everything was put on the line for this movie and it shows.",Null,0,0,30 January 2003
American History X," A punch to the gut!
","This is a great, great film anchored by the amazing and convincing performance by Edward Norton.  There are so many people who think like him and he dove into this role headfirst, without any apologies.  This movie, along with Irreversible, has one of the most violent scenes put to film, and it is very hard to shake off (even though it happens off screen).  Norton's performance is equal to anything DeNiro did with Scorsese.",Null,3,6,2 June 2003
The Pianist," Wonderfully crafted film
","This film is brilliant and so well done.  It would be great for Brody to win the award as his name seems to get lost in the shuffle of the other nominees.  There are so many touches and brushstrokes in this movie that are great, I don't want to ruin any of them so please go experience this movie. Also, as important as the subject matter is, The Pianist has the same excitement level as a movie like The Fugitive has.",Null,0,0,3 March 2003
Seabiscuit," Snooze-biscuit
","This movie has no edge whatsoever and the Americana style narration undercuts much of the dramatic tension.  The performance on fine, but the script is filled with so many maxim and lessons that I was expecting a pop quiz after the credits.",Null,0,0,14 August 2003
28 Days Later...," Some real cool stuff
",This movie is amazing for its use of desolation.  I have no idea how Boyle got all those shots of empty streets and highways on digital other than actually clearing all those streets.  If this was done on matte it is equally impressive.  Good film!,Null,0,0,28 July 2003
8 Mile," Too much relentless beatings
","I found this movie to be unbearably violent and ultimately unwatchable because of the relentless fighting (particularly when the little girl witnessed the violence in front of her).  Perhaps this is to their credit that it was so realistic, but it just turned my stomach.",Null,0,0,3 June 2003
The Graduate," Great use of music
",Is there any greater pop soundtrack than the one used in The Graduate.  The Simon and Garfunkel music is pitch-perfect.  The guitar riff from the song Mrs. Robinson plays perfectly over Hoffman's desperate drive to find Katherine Ross.  This is just a great movie and Anne Bancroft looks fabulous.,Null,3,6,9 July 2003
This Is Spinal Tap," Works great on tv screen but not at movies?
","I have seen this movie over 30 times and I love it.  I treasure it and know all the great lines and anticipate all the great scenes.  I have seen it twice on the big screen, with an audience of about 50-70 people each time. There were very few laughs and most came during the end credits interviews. I took my wife to see it on the screen and she did not laugh as well.  I have a tough time convincing her that this is the funniest movie ever made. I remember when it first came out and was not a great success in the theatres.  Is this the perfect movie made for the small screen, a bunch of friends over the house and beers and chips?  I believe so.",Null,0,3,12 March 2003
The Godfather: Part III," I have seen this 3 times and feel like I haven't seen it
","What is it about Godfather III?  It's kind of like the cousin at a party no one will talk to.  I was impressed with the look of the film--it looks like it was shot in the 70's.  I liked the performances, especially Andy Garcia. I just felt like I haven't soaked it into my psyche like I have with the previous Godfathers.  It just doesn't seem to fit in, though I am willing to give it another try.",Null,1,2,30 January 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Yuck
","This so called movie, which is really a video-game that you don't play, is so dour and humorless and confusing for no apparent reason.  With its porn film structure and hazy exposition, it bores from the first ten minutes on. Even the 14 minute chase grows old.  Still, I can't wait to see the next one!",Null,0,0,16 June 2003
Bruce Almighty," Written for LCD.
","This movie was dumb but not mute, as Carrey narrated every thing he did while he did it.  He read off numbers on his beeper while the number was clearly on screen, he practically explained every step he took in the movie. How stupid do filmmakers think we are?  This is a movie for four year olds and four year olds only.",Null,0,0,27 May 2003
The Deer Hunter," Real Small Town
","This movie captures small town life and loss in truthful ways that very few movies manage.  Thinking back on the film, it is not about russian roulette and being trapped with rats, but trying to survive deep in the American suburbs.  A classic.",10,0,1,17 June 1999
Identity," Friday the 13th Part Whatever
","This movie was exactly, and I mean exactly like Friday the 13th, same exact plot, exact structure, maybe some better acting.  I saw this because I will see anything with Amanda Peet, but I wish the ads did not make this look like more than it was--ANOTHER FRIDAY THE 13TH!!",Null,0,0,1 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," Rock solid!
","I know nothing about X-Men and didn't even see the first movie and I loved this.  Wall-to-Wall action, all believable special effects, amazing stuff, people going through walls and backing up time and everything you can think of!  Great!  Just wish the release date was a little later because this kind of movie is a real treat when the weather gets hot!  Go see it!",Null,0,0,6 May 2003
The Matrix," Confusarama
","Lucky me that I gave up on the plot very early, cause I could sit back and enjoy Matrix for what it was--wild and fast.  Actually found concept 'real' enough to be scary--could we be getting software downloaded into our systems in the future?  Kicked eXistenZ's butt.",8,0,0,7 May 1999
Gangs of New York," Lost in translation
","Gangs of New York was not a favorite Scorsese because it used as its basis a richly descriptive book and boiled it down to a student chasing mentor story (much more effective in Scorsese's Color of Money).  The shame is that the Gangs were all very interesting in the book.  Really, the movie is hardly about the Gangs of New York at all.  That said, Daniel Day Lewis is absolutely amazing and deserves a nomination.  He is relentless.",Null,0,0,27 January 2003
