Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Everyone needs to lighten up. This movie is hilarious!!!!!
","I can't believe all of these scathing reviews and comments about this film. I am a history professor with a doctorate in religious education and I see this film for what it is, a hilarious and ribald series of 'skits' both improvised and staged, that is meant to elicit laughs using mostly uncomfortable situations, and nothing more. Yes, Sascha Baron Cohen is injecting a bit of social commentary and racial juxtaposition, but it is being used as a tool to make the audience at once uneasy,shocked and then entertained. I think by assuming that because our American society has become desensitized and jaded to all that is shocking,violent,racist etc,Cohen knew that people who would see this film will become aware that they really HAVE'nt seen it all. I can understand how some uptight people might find this movie disturbing, but if anyone has ever seen interviews with the real Sascha Baron Cohen, they would see that he is a very intelligent man with a gift for satire. Did he go overboard for some people? apparently so, but I laughed my ass off. This country would be a much better place if everyone wasn't so uptight about who they are, and we all need to have dialogues with each other and discover one another's differences and the stories and facts behind them. The lack of knowledge about our fellow human beings is why there is racial strife.",10,3,19,13 November 2006
