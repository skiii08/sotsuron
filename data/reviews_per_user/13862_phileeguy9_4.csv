Angels & Demons," Faster paced than Da Vinci Code, but not better
","Angels and Demons puts our main character, Robert Langdon, back to work solving historical puzzles and following clues in Rome and Vatican City. But as much as Hanks plays the part well enough and Howard directed quite nicely, I didn't feel that this film was as good as the Da Vinci Code.The Plot itself is plausible enough, pitting the Illuminati against the Catholic Church, with Langdon being called in for help. Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer portrayed their respective characters admirably, as does the supporting cast.I would say that the pacing of this movie is my main fault with it. The movie itself is roughly over 2 hours, the time frame the movie is set in is basically double that. And with certain plot points forcing Langdon to race all over Rome, you weren't given many times in the movie where historical events were discussed in a way to more fully explain the present-day findings and happenings in the film. In 'Code' it may have been set in a time-span of one night, but we had down times in mansions, planes, museums, churches and such explaining things. This allowed for the audience to digest that information, but in Angels and Demons these down times didn't exist.As for other departments I would say that the sound and visual effects were well done, but not spectacular. This isn't Star Trek, so no need for being over-the-top there. One department that I thought was lacking was in music. I thought Zimmer did a great job in 'Code' but he didn't really match himself here. Then again, most of the music of his I enjoyed in 'Code' were during the down times which are lacking in this film.Sequels, or in this case, prequels don't usually tend to do as well as the originals, and I know Ron Howard and Tom Hanks planned on making this film better than The Da Vinci Code, but I don't think they pulled it off. It's not a bad film, but I would've liked to seen more history and less running from place to place.",6,3,6,17 May 2009
The Hangover," I have to see it again, if only to catch the parts I missed while laughing
","This is definitely one of the best comedies I've seen in quite some time. It get's you laughing in one way or another by being crude, surprising, shocking, and just plain weird.The movie is about four buddies heading off to Vegas to have some fun before the Groom-to-be (played by Justin Bartha of the National Treasure movies most notably) is to be wed. The hi-jinks ensue the morning of the hangover as they are left wondering what happened and how it happened.Each of our main four actors adds their own brand of humor to the movie, but I thought Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis stood out and made the movie especially funny.I'd definitely suggest one checks this movie out on video, if not in the theaters. But, this movie earned its R rating, so I wouldn't recommend letting the youngest of children watch it.",9,5,8,6 June 2009
Quantum of Solace," Good Bond entry, and a viable plot continuing film.
","Quantum of Solace (QOS from here on out) was a good film in my opinion, but not quite as good as its prior entry in the Bond film franchise.QOS picks up the plot pretty seamlessly from the end of Casino Royale (CR from now on), as Bond fights his way to find who is involved in the criminal organization known as the 'Quantum,' what they plan on doing and why they would have his love, Vesper Lynd, want to let herself die to spare Bonds' life.However, that seem begins to fray after the first few action scenes and about 15 minutes into the film as you are thrust into new locales with many new faces, each having their own agendas. This leaves you having to decipher who is important to the story, what are their back-stories, and who are minor players. Usually a film will allow you the time to take the information in, but QOS likes to jump to action scenes more often than CR did, making the plot comprehension a little more difficult, I thought.Still, by about halfway through the movie you should have a good grasp on who's who, and what's generally going on, which allows you to not needlessly dwell on subject matter, and enjoy the action scenes. At the end I knew the plot could've been advanced further as we know that this story will continue in another Bond sequel, but I also felt satisfied where they left it. Also remember that QOS was only 106 minutes, compared to CR at 144 minutes.The amount and length of the action scenes in QOS varies a good deal from the action in CR. It felt that - and I would wager - the scenes were somewhat shorter in QOS, but there were many more of them, many being more elaborate and expansive. Whether it be general hand-to-hand combat, chase scenes, or your grand explosion scenes. Also, if you had to distinguish the two in this manner, CR was more the scalpel of the spy action flicks, whereas QOS was the machete.At the end I give QOS an 8/10, but only because there was no 7.5 rating available to me, and since I enjoy Bond films I rounded up. I have to say I'm liking this turn the Bond franchise has taken. As much as I delighted in James' quips and comebacks, Q and his gadgetry, and the uber-villains and their henchmen of previous Bond films, I won't miss them as long as those involved keep the bar set high for these new films. Hopefully Daniel Craig can do what the other Bonds couldn't accomplish: have his entries continue to get progressively better.",8,1,4,16 November 2008
Clash of the Titans," It's as if I've seen this movie before...
","...Probably it's because I have. That's why they call these things re-makes, this one being re-made from the 1981 version. Still, I found it a bit sad that the writers didn't come up with many new ideas when they could have. Yes, they had to follow the same plot path in Perseus asking the 3 witches how to defeat the Kraken, taking Medusa's head, and speeding back upon Pegasus to turn the monster to stone. But there are so many minor scenes and plot points that didn't need to be recreated basically identical to the 1981 film.For example, in this movie Perseus fights giant scorpions that spawn from venomous blood. Yeah, that was in the original. In this movie Perseus is given a sword from Zeus himself and has a mighty shield with a mirror on the inside in which he uses to defeat Medusa. Yeah, that was in the original. This time around Perseus engages in battle with Calibos, and Calibos loses his arm. Yeah, that was in the original. Heck, even the mechanical owl Bubo was here for a scene. (Actually, that was probably just an homage gag that I rather enjoyed seeing) These are just a few examples of many points of re-using the same ideas instead of coming up with something more original. Couldn't the giant scorpions have spawned some way else, and did they have to be giant scorpions? Couldn't Perseus have defeated Medusa in a more original way? Apart from stealing ideas from the original, this version has characters that are either ham-handed into the story or are altogether superfluous. For example, Calibos - a.k.a. King Acrisius - really wasn't needed other than in the scene where he kills his wife and attempts to kill infant Perseus for his wife sleeping with Zeus. And by the way, if you're going to kill your wife for having an affair why wait 9 months? Why not just kill her immediately? But I digress. In the original movie, Perseus loves Andromeda and you can see why he would risk life and limb to find a way to defeat the Kraken. Andromeda is an afterthought in this movie. And though I can't complain here about the writers' attempts to differ from the original, I think they put the idea of Killing the Kraken to weaken Hades for Perseus to get revenge was a bit of a stretch.Most of the characters in this movie were also expendable, so there wasn't much character development apart from Perseus himself. As for the actors portraying their respective roles, most were forgettable. Sam Worthington was decent enough as Perseus, Mads Mikkelsen was serviceable as Draco, Ralph Fiennes was underused as Hades, and Liam Neeson's Zeus... well let's just say he was no Sir Laurence Olivier.As for the special effects, I thought they were good, not mind-blowing great. Light years better than the original's stop-motion technique, for sure. Most scenes were pleasing to the eye. But I will remark that I think the CGI guys here may have taken a few ideas from Lord of the Rings and mish-mashed them into this movie. Here we have mysterious robed people controlling and riding atop giant scorpions of their own from little enclosures that reminded me a lot of the Oliphants. And the Kraken itself reminded me a lot of just a super-sized Cave Troll with tentacles. As for the 3-D effect, I cannot comment positive or negative as I wasn't able to see it in a 3-D showing.Music was nothing to write home about. In fact I'd say it was also forgettable as I can't for the life of me describe the music as I've already forgotten it not 5 hours from seeing the film. And they used pretty much your basic battle scene smashing and clanking noises. So, not great, but not horrible sound effects.Okay so that's pretty much my in-depth review for this movie, sorry about the spoilers. But I did click the 'contains spoilers' box, so you were warned. If you may be wondering why I rated this 6/10 instead of a lower score after 6 paragraphs of pointing out its flaws or average nature, it's because I still thought it was a somewhat decent movie. Perhaps not one you need to run out to the theaters to see, but it's good enough to rent. I don't know, maybe I'm being too kind because I'm a little nostalgic due to the fact that I rather enjoyed the 1981 version of 'Clash of the Titans,' campy nature and all. In fact I prefer the original to this, but that's just my opinion. Feel free to watch both and compare for yourself.",6,0,2,3 April 2010
