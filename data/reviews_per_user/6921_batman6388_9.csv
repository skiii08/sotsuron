Minority Report," This is probally the best movie of the decade
","I just came from seeing this movie and I was shocked at how this movie was so well directed by steven spielberg.  His vision is so imaginitive, from the vertical freeway to the retinal spiderscan to the brilliant idea of a precrime system where police officials can see crime before it even happens. I have to tell you, this is a side of film directing I have never seen from Steven Spielberg.  There's virtual orgies, eye surgery, a lot of sexual stuff....but I like it, it's a side I've never seen from Spielberg.  Tom Cruise's performance is great but who I really enjoyed was Collin Farrel as a represantive trying to find flaws with the precrime system.  In other words, the movie was just pure entertainment and fun.  I loved the scene with the precrime cops chasing cruise in an apartment building.I give the movie a 10 out of 10",Null,0,0,25 July 2002
Fight Club," This is my favorite movie of all time...
","Fight Club truly was one of my favorite films of the 90's and maybe my favorite film ever.  It's just one of those movies you have to see twice to get it.  This is a perfect example of movie with meaning.  And Pitt was freakin awesome as Tyler Durden(my role model) and Edward Norton was awesome too.  The script was great and Fincher is just one of my favorites with films such as Seven(awesome), The Game(awesome), & Panic Room(Awesome). Fight Club is about an office slave insomniac who is living in a world of IKEA furniture catalogs and Starbucks.  And the only way, he found out, to relieve his insomnia is to go to retreat groups for patients of terminal diseases such as Testicular Cancer, Tuberculosis, Parasites, and more. That's where he meets Marla Singer who is a chain smoking woman who like Norton is faking his diseases to go to groups.  He is then interupted and cannot go to sleep.  He then meets another person, Tyler Durden which h meets on an airplane.  I'm not telling you the rest.  Count on me, this is a great film.  This is also an example of a College Poster Movie(a movie's poster is on a college frat, dorm, etc.)  It's really bad a**.9/10",10,0,2,30 March 2003
Citizen Kane," this movie sucks
",This movie is the probally the most boring and the worst movie i've ever seen.  The cinematography is fair but the movie is just really long and boring.  It was full of dialogue that sucked and it was just a really bad movie.  I don't know what all the buzz is about with this movie.  They say this movie is probally the best movie ever made......are you smoking a pipe full of hasheesh?......a good movie is Airheads.,Null,3,8,8 July 2002
Apocalypse Now," A very artistic film
","This is Francis Ford Coppola's third best movie alongside The Godfather and The Godfather part 2, Coppola shows his artistic view of the tragedy of the Vietnam war.  Coppola brings the story of Captain Willard, who is dillusional of fighting the war, gets a call from the general of the U.S. army to take a very classified mission.  The mission is to kill a highly declarated general(Brando) who has gone mad.  The movie starts off as a vietnam war powerhouse, in which Willard(Sheen) is getting a ride with his troop to Cambodia with a very crazy Robert Duvall who starts a bomb raid on a North Vietnamese village.  Then between the middle of the movie til' the end of the movie it starts getting very disturbing.  The one who really gets you scared is Marlon Brando who gives a very disturbing performance .  The movie is great and it was well done by Francis Ford Coppola.  I give this movie a 7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,27 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," this is really good
","I went on a field trip to see the two towers and boy this movie is freaking good.  It starts out strong and instead of like in the book where the first half starts out with marry, pippin, aragorn, legolas, and gimli....instead it starts out with frodo and sam and then goes back and forth with the characters.  The battle of Helm's Deep was amazing and kick ass.  But I personally wanted to see Smeagol/Gollum and when i did i was amazed.....he looked real and he was cool. OUr of all the movie was god and better than the first.....9/10",Null,0,0,18 December 2002
Coyote Ugly," These chicks are hot
","The only reason I saw this movie is because the chicks are hot.  I consider this a chick flick for girls that don't know what good acting is.  But what could be better than Tyra Banks, and all these other hot chicks in a bar 'dancing', nothing of course.  Very poor acting though and very lame plot; it's about a girl from New Jersey(REPRESENTING) who wants to leave the small town and go to New York City to be a singer.  But in the meanwhile she gets a full time job as a 'coyote', a slang name for a woman that works at a popular bar called Coyote Ugly.  The bar brings beer, hot chicks, and great music, and another situation she has to deal with is a new boyfriend.  The movie is horrible but I prefer seeing this movie than seeing BattleField Earth, in which you didn't know......it's probably one of the worst movies made in film. I give this Coyote Ugly a 4 out of 10.",Null,0,0,29 July 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," movie sucks
",This movie sucks so much ass that it sucked it's own ass in.  I hated this movie.  It was real slow and boring and the dialogue sucked.  Harrison Ford was horrible as a Russian submarine captain.  If I can tell him a mistake he has done in his career it's him and his dumb russian accent.  And let me tell you....after spending 2 hours during the movie....i still don't know what the movie is about.  I had a choice-- i mean my family had a choice in which movie to see....Barber Shop or K19....before and after the movie i still pick barber shop.  Now I have to spend my money and rent barber shop when i could've just seen it right there instead of k19.,Null,1,3,23 February 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," The best movie i've ever seen
",The shawshank redemption is probably the one of the best films ever depicted in cinematic form.  It is the most controversial and sad film I've ever seen; second is American history x.  I loved this film and I thought Tim Robbins was excellent and Morgan Freeman as well.  Let me just say to that everybody should see this film.  I give it 4/4,Null,1,2,2 March 2003
Back to the Future," This movie is freakin awesome
","Robert Zemeckis is a film genius in every aspect of this film.  If you don't like this film you are probally a very stupid person that has no taste in good filmaking.  This time traveling epic stars Michael J. Fox and the master of comedic acting, Christopher Lloyd.  The plot is brilliant.  It's 1985 and Marty McFly's(Fox) life is boring and strict.  He's a troublemaker in school, has strict and boring parents and one of his friends is a mad scientist(Lloyd);the only good part in Marty's life is his girlfriend in which he is supposed to take her to the mountains for the weekend but his parents won't let him.  So in the middle of the night, Doc(Lloyd) calls Marty and tells him to bring a video camera to tape his new time machine. When he gets their, Marty finds out that Doc stole plutoneum from terrorists, Marty is forced to go back in time to 1957 because terrorists are attacking Doc and Marty.  So he goes back in time and ends up getting hit by a car in which the driver is his grandfather and ends up waking up in his house with his mother, as a teenager, falls in love with him and ends up turning everything thats in the future into dust because she is supposed to fall in love George McFly, Marty's dad.  It's a very interesting movie and and it's a real film classic.  I love Michael J. Fox's performance.  I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",Null,0,1,28 July 2002
