The Blair Witch Project," I wasn't scared
","I'm not a huge fan of bloody horror films, but I love to be scared as much as anyone.  Due to the prerelease hype I was really looking forward to this movie.  Sadly, I found this film more boring than scary.  The endless arguing and trudging through the woods got old really fast.  If you've ever had to sit through the projects of some untalented film students you'll find these scenes true to form.  For me, there was no tension building.  The fact that the clueless group was lost in the woods had me worrying more than any supernatural events.This movie is a great example of average filmmaking and excellent low budget marketing.  It's good enough to rent, but not to spend $8 on.",5,1,2,3 August 1999
