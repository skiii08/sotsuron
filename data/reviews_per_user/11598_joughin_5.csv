The Blair Witch Project," Tedious amateur hiking movie
","Irritating, pretentious, mannered, contrived, histrionic, self-indulgent, self-conscious tedium.Hey - wave the Hi-8 around a lot to show it's handheld.  Shout and swear a lot to make everyone think you're REALLY wound-up and scared (but keep on shooting whatever happens - hey they're going to kill me. what a really INTERESTING shot.)An amateur attempt at conveying an amateur attempt at making a film, with everything in underlined capital italics.  With plot and dialogue and characterization that don't work, so that the whole basis of fear - identification with the characters and suspension of disbelief in the plot - never begins to work either.It might have been a bit better on radio.All that said, the marketing was pure genius, and deserved a special Oscar.",Null,0,1,4 April 2003
Vertigo," Contrived and Schematic
","I'd been meaning to see this film for years, but sorry, I just laughed at the silly end.The Master seems basically to be illustrating some more or less 'Freudian' idea about 're-enactment' (or 'acting and re-enacting', maybe), but cuts (sometimes expertly, of course) an awful lot of corners with the characterization and plot.50-year-old Jimmy Stewart rather suddenly decides he's 'in love' with 25-year old Kim Novak (26 in the film, married for some unexplained reason to a 54-year-old husband - but she's supposed to be the rich one..).  Even more suddenly the 25/6-year old risks a very long jail term (and in fact worse, but I'd better not give it away) by inexplicably 'falling in love' with the rather sketchy character of a stranger twice her age the first moment she meets him.  When she indulges what can only be called Jimmy's necrophilia later on, I found myself just cringing for the actors (who didn't always seem completely convinced of characters and plots either) rather than succumbing to fear, suspense &c.Maybe the world was very different in 1958, but I found what I'd expected to be a masterpiece more like an irritating didactic exercise: an unquestionably brilliant filmmaker subordinates the logic of a film to some half-digested idea borrowed from outside film, instead of finding his ideas in the logic of film itself.",5,9,23,23 June 2001
There Will Be Blood," Perhaps the most tedious, irritating film I've ever sat through
","Let's start with the positive: good Art Direction.OK, that's over.Histrionic acting - especially Daniel Day Lewis playing late-career Sean Connery (WHY???) playing a timewarped American who barely changes in any respect from 1898 to 1927 (or is it finally 1929?... nobody else changes physically or otherwise, either, except his irritating son and the son's arbitrary girlfriend, who suddenly morph into different actors in order to get married).Oh, the LENGTH, the LENGTH of this ordeal... and the pretentious editing. And the S-L-O-W-N-E-S-S... apart from the occasional hectic scraping of violins, like fingernails drawn manically across a blackboard.I can't be bothered to go on. I've wasted far too much of my life on this misanthropic, nihilistic torture already.",3,1,3,1 March 2009
Vanilla Sky," A painful waste of time.
","There were lots of these movies through the 90s - Groundhog Day, Strange Days, The Truman Show, The Matrix, Pleasantville, Memento and others, using Film as a metaphor for an illusory life. I liked most of them... but found this late arrival relentlessly contrived, pretentious, narcissistic, vacuous, tedious...It would have been better if they'd just played it all out in front of a big mirror as home entertainment, with loads of breaks for self-congratulation. In fact, most of the time, looking at the screen was like staring cringefully at the hammy acting, lousy direction and terrible script through a two-way mirror. Why did all these sad characters have to rope in a cinema audience to convince themselves how hip and clever they were? I thought Tarantino was the ne plus ultra of pretentious narcissism. This runs him pretty close, without the art.I guess you'd call this self-conscious tripe 'postmodern'. It's basically a very old genre - as old as the illusion of moving pictures themselves. There are great German Expressionist examples, like Nosferatu - but my all-time favourite is Jacques Rivette's Céline et Julie vont en Bateau (1974). It is not 10, but a thousand times better than this embarrassing dross, and infinitely more engaging, imaginative and playful. See it instead. Please.Oh... and I liked the Dylan song (and screamed in dismay at the Freewheelin' cover cover). What were you thinking of Bob? What were you on?",1,2,6,9 May 2007
The Thin Red Line," A Revelation
","At last  the Truth about WWII.  It was won by disorganized groups of neurotic existentialists, with late-90s haircuts, speech-patterns and concerns, who never got the plot because John Travolta didn't get enough time off from finishing Primary Colors to explain it to his men.  Airplanes were used only for ceremonial purposes, before and after battles led by psychologically damaged commanders with no strategic direction.  In fact, film is not really an appropriate medium to depict the geopolitical forces at work in the conflict with Fascism.  We can best understand it as Off-Broadway studio theatre, with the individual anxieties of the small cast a subtle composite projection of the director's state of mind. Unfortunately, the director had to work with film, but he managed to maintain the intimate studio feel by concentrating on close-ups and monologue, and eliminating any wider narrative frame.",Null,0,1,10 August 2003
