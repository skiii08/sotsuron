The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Hmmm... Matrix Revolutions Anyone?
","First up, I've never been a fan of The Hunger Games.Ever!Yes I am an avid Battle Royale fan, but I'm always willing to give something a chance. But there is just something about these movies that makes me hate them...In fact, there is quite a few.The actors, for the most part are not that appealing. This is made even worse with the characters they play, with such over-acting and pantomime like approach.Their character names are some of the most annoying I have come across, and cringe when each and everyone says Peeta as if they have a speech problem and just want to call him Peter.Regardless, and for the sake of my husband, I had to endure the first two, of which you can find my reviews there. There is too much nonsense and typical Hollywood goofs to go on about, but with part 2 slightly better than the first, I went in to this one without complaining much, expecting a rip roaring adventure that may see the actors a little more comfortable in their roles that would lead to enjoying them a bit better...Boy was I wrong!Thumbs up for creating a darker, more bleak version of its previous movies, but having hardly any recollection of how part 2 ended so abruptly, I was lost from the get-go.What I did find however, was that this was more Divergent than Hunger Games, layered somewhat over the blue print of the Matrix Revolutions, which in itself was a big mess of a movie!Once again, the sheer appearance of the chubby faced Lawrence and not-so-pretty Hutcherson had me cringe each time they appeared on screen. Other characters were less pantomime which was helpful, and yet again, the mess of Hollywood goofs kept me entertained to the end...Katpiss' arrows always staying the same number even after being fired. The Capitol being able to broadcast video even during a power shortage. And my favourite, the Hollywood CCTV camera!Even with so many 'talented' crew and film makers on board, this one never fails to amaze me... We, as the viewers, watch as Katpiss shoots down some aircraft that are after them. Then later, we see a cleverly edited video of her doing so in a promotional effort, that includes many of the shots used by the film makers for us.That means, those in District 13 would have had to contact the producers of THG: Mockingjay 1 and ask for said footage, which in theory we all know would be a tricky thing for them to do. But somehow, it all happens for them. Amazing!A film about democracy, that sees all of those in the corner for it, dressed alike, living alike and chanting alike, in a very communist way... All that state of the art technology underground, and they are still serving slop, dressing in boiler suits, and don't even have a coffee machine.Mockingjay Part 1 will do for the fans no doubt, but it was long winded, boring and then some. No doubt when we all see the last instalment, we will then get a better idea of what they could have chopped out to make one big film that entertained.Until then...",3,19,31,2 December 2014
Dawn of the Dead," One Of Snyders Best!!
","I remember when this first came out, the buzz about it and the apprehension going to see it. After all, 28 Days Later had already made such a splash and a remake of such a classic was never met with any positivity really...But what a surprise then, and even now - watching it years later - it still rocks and delivers on horror and action.This was Zack Snyder's first feature as a director and it certainly shows what a different director he was then to the one he became once the Hollywood doors flung open!!Scripted by Guardians of the Galaxy director, James Gunn, this fast moving remake is packed full of gore, violence, action, and memorable moments that definitely made it a favourite among horror fans all over.While it is a no-brainer, there is a couple of minor gripes for me that stop it from being a 5 star film. These would be due to a few silly moments, typically stupid American stereotypes and lines, and couple of annoying characters - especially the young girl who comes in second half and messes everything up over a dog...Ridiculous.In fact, the movie could have went a totally different way had she just got thrown to the zombies!Apart from that though, I do love this film. I think Snyder should sit down and rewatch this before he sets out to do anything else and get a reminder of how creativity works best when budget can't...",8,5,7,12 October 2019
Knives Out," Simply Wonderful!!
","Bringing a Cluedo (Clue) game to the big screen and to a modern audience in 2019 may have seemed somewhat of a gamble for director Rian Johnson. With the (welcome) influx of superhero movies, big budget visual effects, snappy editing and dumbed down scripts - a film such such as Knives Out, presented in a cinematic style that reminds me of similar classics from yesteryear, just may have been too smart for a millennial audience...And whether they got it or not, the film has certainly proven to be one of this years finest and best Hollywood productions which I just loved!Honestly, I went in not expecting much - but those expectations quickly faded within the first ten minutes as I was sucked in to this hilarious murder mystery.With great performances from all involved, although Marta was my fave - as well as tons of little Easter eggs and nods to many inspirations before it, I couldn't say a bad thing about Knives Out and was so happy that my 16 year old son could experience such a great film on the big screen, so different to his usual viewings.A pleasure to watch and entertaining the whole way through, Knives Out could be in the top 3 for 2019..!",10,0,4,26 December 2019
The Shining," Outdated Classic But Still Works!!
","I was lucky enough to catch this classic on the big screen - a night before I saw its belated sequel, Dr. Sleep - and thoroughly enjoyed it, yet at the same time found myself getting a bit bored of The Shining.While 'those' iconic moments stood out and looked good on the screen, I couldn't help but find the film boring at times and felt the whole thing overall, to be quite dated!Jack gets better as the show rolls on, as does the kid - but the showstopper goes to Shelley Duval for some incredibly dreadful acting to the point that anytime she appeared on screen, we just burst out laughing..!It was hilarious and helped speed the film along somewhat, but my God, what was Kubrick thinking?The Shining still has its charm though as a classic horror thriller. While far from perfect and a little rough around the edges, the film has its moments and is most definitely worth a watch...But it's long lost its fear factor for me.",6,3,7,31 October 2019
Divergent," Better than Hunger Games I suppose.
","Divergent is another one of those big cast adaptations of best selling books that no one has eve heard of until the movie comes out.I mean, I think I am in the loop with all things, but I never did hear of this one.That said, and with my hatred of The Hunger Games, I still give this one a go...Without being as cheesy and annoying as THG, Divergent focuses more on the bigger picture. Different societies as opposed to children, have issues with each other. Of course, there is the love story, although a bit later on which is good, and plenty of annoying characters who you don't mind seeing killed off if and when it happens.The main cast is quite fresh faced still, but like those of THG, I didn't really take to them and didn't get much screen presence from them at all.The film is watchable. Its far from the best thing out there, but it passes the time and has a few enjoyable moments.I wouldn't rush out to get it, but if you are bored, give it a go!",5,0,0,4 September 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," One of the best super hero films to date!
","X-men movies - from the very beginning, have always been a hard watch for me. They seemed too... I don't know, like a polished theatre production compared to the colourful adventures of other super hero movies.I liked them though. Not so much the particular changes like costume, or even some of the casting choices, but they grow on you.When Fist Class came out though, I was blown away! Here was the colourful X-men I hoped to see, with incredible uses of powers and decent casting. It was great!!And then I heard that Bryan Singer was returning to bring us this... Days Of Future Past. Oh no... back to square one.Boy was I wrong.And thank fully so! Days Of Future Past was just incredible. With a host of characters I was grateful to see, some fantastic action scenes with uses of powers and Halle Berry as Storm in an extended cameo which is more than enough!It was just phenomenal. Looking forward to having it in my collection and only wished I saw it on the big screen more than once.",10,1,3,1 July 2014
Ghost Rider," Under-rated Marvel fun!
","Ghost Rider - the hero - is very popular in the comic world... I mean, just in the comic world, because the most of the public who don't read comics, have never hear of him!So when a film was announced, I was intrigued to see what would come out of it. Then when Ridiculous Cage was headlined as the hero himself, my intrigue turned to worry...Upon initial viewing, I was - honestly - a little disappointed. I find it hard to enjoy Cage (with Kick Ass being his finest hour to me), and felt that some silly moments made by the studios decisions, left this Marvel flick a bit flat.Then recently I found the extended edition at my local pound store and figured, for a pound, I could add that to my super hero collection (and put up with the extra running time).And I'm glad I did.Knowing what to expect now, I actually rally enjoyed it for a second (and third) time. My kids love it, and it is growing on me very quickly. Cage is - well, Cage. You can't change that! But he pulls of the role comfortably and has plenty of humour to work with which suits him best.Ghost Rider suffered a lot of hatred upon release, but its not as bad as you think. Definitely worth the re-watch, and a great piece of super hero action cinema!",6,0,0,2 July 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Beautiful.
","I enjoy Ben Stiller.He doesn't change much as a character, but he rarely disappoints.I also enjoy him as a director, and with this little gem, he confirms just how great at doing it he really is!The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is just beautiful. Visually gorgeous, with the feel of an indie movie, the film was both hilarious and moving without any Hollywood cheese and plenty of amazing moments.I don't want to give too much away, but just go see this film for a breath of fresh air.One of Stillers best!",9,1,1,5 September 2014
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Better and bigger than the first!
","The awesome Silver Surfer brings his awesome stellar-galactic self to earth in a bid to find the planet eating Galactus his next meal...Straight away I want to jump to the disappointment of seeing Galactus appear as a big cloud instead of the humanoid character we see in the comic books!Anyhoo, the first FF was family safe fun and nothing in comparison to the other Marvel flicks we had over the last lot of years, but Rise Of The Silver Surfer is pretty sweet.With better FX, better acting(ish), and a lot more - ah, uh - fun, FF2 is a much better ride than its predecessor but still lacks the big punch that all the other Marvel flicks have given us!Watchable, and passable at the same time...",6,0,1,14 July 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," One of Marvel's and 2014's best!
","I have seen GOTG a few times now, and have yet to be bored during any scenes!It is a colourful, exciting, hilarious, and action packed space romp that instantly pulls you in and hooks you.Even without knowing anything about the comic book, you instantly know the characters and find no complaints in their stories and journey, as they keep you smiling and moved the whole way through.I don't think I need to say much more on it as its success speaks volumes!Just go see it on the big screen, and stay post credits for an extra chuckle.",9,0,4,3 September 2014
Joker," Outstanding! One Of The Greatest Films I've Seen In Years!!
","I had avoided all the trailers and press on this film and in all honestly, didn't expect much from it. DC films haven't been the greatest over the past lot of years and here we are again with WB trying to go down another route to try and make something of it...Well - I'm only glad they did.Joker is quite simply one of the finest pieces of film I have seen in a long time - especially from Hollywood, which isn't too often. From Joaquin's incredible performance (just amazing), to the stunning cinematography and score, I just can't think of a single moment that lost me.Well done Todd Phillips and team, and well done Joaquin for the greatest performance of the Joker ever!",10,7,12,5 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," One of 2014's best and biggest!
","Cashing in on the recent successes of certain games (Gears of War etc), Tom Cruise explodes on screen as a poster boy for the US army put in the awkward spot of fighting on the front line.But this war is about mecha-suits and aliens (awesomely creepy looking aliens by the by), set in a near future that looks pretty bleak.Personal life aside, I like Tom Cruise. He rarely fails to deliver and is one of the greatest stars in Hollywood. In Edge Of Tomorrow, he gives one of his best performances yet, in this action epic!With numerous laugh-out-loud moments and plenty of eye popping action, some of which are carried out fantastically by Emily Blunt, watching the same scenes over and over again (due to its Groundhog Day story line) never tire.Beautifully done, and a great companion piece to the fantastic Oblivion.",10,1,3,1 July 2014
Jojo Rabbit," Quite Simply Put - One Of The Best Films I've Seen!!
","Jojo Rabbit is quite simply one of the best films I've seen. I would say this year, but its only January 5th - so I'm happy to put that claim into the 'ever' section of my reviews!With such simplicity, director Taika Waititi gives us an emotional roller-coaster ride of hilarious comedy, heartbreaking moments, poignant scenes, romance, friendship, realism, and war... And he delivers it almost flawlessly in one of the greatest satirical movies ever.Child actor Roman Griffin Davis is just super cute as Jojo, delivering an incredible performance as a dedicated child of Hitlers youth who's only dream is to be in his army and is guided through life by his imaginary friend - Hitler himself, played hilariously by director Taika!Taika just nails it as an insecure leader of the people, offering up ridiculous plans and ideas to try and guide little Jojo through life as a nazi. His portrayal of der Fuher is just brilliant and, to me, came across like a human version of Bugs Bunny in many physical moments as well as his silly ideas...Loved it!In fact, the casting of everyone involved just works wonderfully!! I couldn't find fault with any of them. Scarlett was brillaint as his mother as was Thomasin McKenzie as his Jew friend-love-interest hiding in the attic. Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen's hidden love was so well done, as were their characters, and Jojo's little friend Yorki is equally as cute and funny with his little random scenes and delivery, but for me, RGD totally steals the show as Jojo - delivering a number of heartbreaking moments with such a natural performance.I love Jojo Rabbit and can't wait to see it again!An amazing film!!",10,3,8,5 January 2020
A Night at the Roxbury," Hilariously Stupid With Great Soundtrack!!
","A Night At The Roxbury is an old favourite of mine. A film my best friend and I used to watch almost every week on its release, we laughed our heads off then and having watched it again last night for the first time in 20 years - I laughed my head off again!!Probably louder than everyone else - but it became kinda nostalgic for me when the music, the head bopping, silly dancing and one liners came about, but it still worked!One of the best Saturday Night Live films - if not, the best - ANATR sometimes plays out like a collection of skits, but ultimately does have a storyline that knits it all together quite well.Is it ridiculous? Yes of course. Is it funny? Damn right!A Night At The Roxbury might go unnoticed by a younger audience today, and yes it may mean more to me because of the memories, but I do think it holds up well and anyone who is a fan of Jim Carrey's early work will love this tale of brotherhood, love and dance music...",8,1,1,11 October 2019
Godzilla," Godzilla cameo's in Hollywood's latest attempt!
","This visually stunning blockbuster is Hollywood's second attempt at cashing in on the success of the greatest film monster ever know... Godzilla!As we all know, the 90's version was hilarious for all the wrong reasons and should have actually black listed Hollywood from ever being allowed to do remakes ever again.Mind you, that should have happened with the 80's cartoon of Godzilla...So here we are again, with the finest in CGI and all in the hands of new director Gareth Edwards who shot to fame with his indie hit, Monsters.Personally, Monsters bored the sh*t out of me and it took me a number of years to get through it without turning it off after 20 minutes. The problem I found with that, seems to have drifted in to this, and that is where lies the failure.Focused more on the human side and drama of his stories, Edwards fails to recognise that Godzilla is the hero, the titular character, and above all, the star of any Godzilla movie.This in turn leaves us with a beautifully made film about the US army (yay) who take on alien creatures intent on destroying the planet (or the US at least).Oh yeah, and there is a cameo by Godzilla.",6,3,6,1 July 2014
Fantastic Four," Family Friendly Super Hero Fun... Just.
","I've never been a huge fan of the FF even in the comic book world. I find them boring and out-dated, so when I hear about the big Hollywood adaptation and knowing what Hollywood had on the cards from Marvel studios, I was a little excited!But I needn't have been.The result seemed so tame in another case of what could have been, dropping a lot of the dark side of Doom for that family PG label... Pity.Don't get me wrong, there is a number of great and exciting moments - that my kids love. A great scene with the handsome Chris Evans in a towel (coat) and some fun action - but so cheesy its hilarious!The acting is somewhat bearable, and scripting and direction slightly lazy. Lets hope the remake (2015) FF film gives us something better... but then again, with a black Jonny Storm I'm already asking what the hell?!?",5,1,3,14 July 2014
