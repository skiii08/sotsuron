The Blair Witch Project," Scary...but not as great as it's made out to be.
","Ok...it is creepy. It's also hard to follow at times. I'm also wondering why anyone would hold on to a camera during some of the most intense times. I know...heather says that it is, 'all she has...' but, still. The end was creepy and left me with a sick feeling in my stomach. I think I'm a victim of the hype. I was expecting to be blown away and wasn't. I wish I could have discovered it like the folks at Sundance did...having no idea what the hell they were about to see. I think the Blair Witch is actually Jar Jar Binks. Hmmmm....",Null,0,1,19 September 1999
X-Men," A Solid, Enjoyable Ride...
","I was losing my mind waiting to see X-Men...and the wait was worth it.  This movie took me back to my room, circa 1976 where my comic books ruled my little life.  It was a great escape and a solid action ride from start to finish.Now, I'm waiting for the sequel.I hope it's 4 hours long.",8,0,0,31 July 2000
For Love of the Game," A movie that is hard to get involved in...
","I go to movies really wanting to have a good time.  I had been waiting to see F.L.O.T.G for awhile and it ended up being not worth the wait. I understood it was a 'relationship' movie more that a 'baseball' movie, but the relationship was too confusing and the baseball was too clinical. The way that Sam Raimi jumped all over the place with his direction didn't help matters either. The acting was solid, but it was solid in a very Hollywood kind of way. By that I mean, you see the wheels turning. You may have a different take...check it out for yourself.",Null,0,0,19 September 1999
Any Given Sunday," Worth seeing for the football scenes...
","I went into this movie expecting something that I had not seen before because Oliver Stone always delivers. Perhaps there have just been too many 'sports movies.' The football scenes alone are visually exciting and worth the price of a ticket. The story seems hellbent on hitting every sports cliche in the book, though. We have 'The Legend' in the guise of both quarterback and coach, played by Dennis Quaid and Al Pacino. I have seen this performance from Pacino too many times...where is the quiet calm of Michael Corleone? We also have the Brash Rookie played by Jamie Foxx and we also have 'The Tragedy' in the form of Lawrence Taylor - a player who needs to hang it up before he gets killed, but can't walk away. Overall, the movie was good - not great. I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. Perhaps it was a case of too much 'star power.' Let me know if this helped at all.",6,0,0,23 December 1999
Gladiator," A Visual Stunner and Nice Escape on a Hot Summer day.
","First the good, I finally got to see what the big deal about the Roman Empire was.  When you read it in books and see it in pictures it doesn't have the same punch as when it becomes a living breathing thing as it does in Gladiator.  Russel Crowe is great as Maximus and Phoenix makes Commodus the biggest wussy in recent cinema.  Overall, I give a big yippie-yahoo to Gladiator for a nice escape from whatever you are escaping from.  My only complaint?  It was just a wee bit long and the drama-love story aspect of it just was a bit of a letdown.  How long did it take Maximus to get from Germania to his house anyway?  Did anyone else notice that his hair had grown out?  Who cares, right?  Enjoy the show...but, I suggest you buy a snack and hit the head before settling in.",7,0,0,14 June 2000
