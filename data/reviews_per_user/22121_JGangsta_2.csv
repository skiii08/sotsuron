The Ring," Kids need to toughen up.
","I'm going to keep this short.  This movie was garbage.  If this is what scares kids today, kids today are pussywillows.  The only good thing about this movie was the cinematography, and even that wasn't as good as most movies.  The story is terribly linear.  Naomi Watts has the answers to every question that is placed in front of her, with very little conflict. Anyone who says this doesn't resort to jolts and loud noises must've been high when they saw the movie, because that's the only way they got any kind of rise out of me.  This is just more proof that the horror movie industry is dying a slow and painful death.  The studios have run out of ideas, and have to make remakes of foreign films that no one has heard of to bring anything fresh to the screen.  Naomi Watts looked good, Brian Cox was good in his role, as he always is, but the movie that my classmates describe to me as 'The scariest movie I've ever seen' are really mis-informed.  The Ring is scum, awful, awful scum.  I'm talking shoe scrapings after stepping in turd and waiting a year to clean it off scum.  of ten, I would be kind and give this a 1.1/10.  Go see the Exorcist, then talk to me about a well done scary movie.  Wow, I guess I didn't keep it very short.",Null,1,3,29 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Glorious!
","Ahhhh....A fitting end to a glorious trilogy of fine pieces of film. Delivers on every level!  Notable are the effectively creepy roles of Gollum, and that CGI Shilob, or whatever the hell it's name is.  Fantastic action sequences with stunning special effects and sound that knocks you back into your seat.  A perfect resolution to the trilogy.  Perfectly captures the drama, the pain, and the suffering that is experienced by Frodo and Sam as they venture closer to Mount Doom, as well as the comraderie between the remainder of the fellowship, the bravery of the Hobbits, and even the very lightly mentioned love between Aragorn and Arwen.  I can't find anything wrong with this movie outside of the unexplained absence of Chris Lee as Saruman....Scores a 10 of 10 in my book!",Null,0,0,17 December 2003
