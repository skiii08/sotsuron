The Blair Witch Project," Remarkable...
","...not the movie, the people COMMENTING on it. I've posted once before, but scrolling down, I see that there are STILL so many suckers who bought INTO this piece of garbage, I felt it necessary to reiterate a few key points, mainly:-'The Blair Witch Project' is, hands down, one of THE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE. And yeah, I AM taking movies like 'I Spit On Your Grave', 'Nail Gun Massacre', and 'Robot Holocaust' into consideration. When you have NO script (I still can't believe that), amateurish cinematography that prevents you from actually SEEING anything ('use your imagination', the flick's fans bray, missing the point that when EVERYTHING is left to the imagination there's no point in SEEING the movie at all), 'actors' whose best ad-libbing comes in the form of repetitive and offensive cursing, and a classic 'Ebert Situation' - that the whole movie could have been over in fifteen minutes had the characters not been complete IDIOTS - this is to be expected.-That BWP made the kind of money it did is a damning indictment of the American filmgoer, and a tribute to the effectiveness of fake word-of-mouth. So many people believed this was real, or terrified themselves by putting themselves 'in the situation'. Three words: Follow the river. There; the whole movie is unnecessary. But the characters are so stupid that this sure-fire solution never occurs to them... and these are COLLEGE students? It's never a good sign when you WANT the heroes to die.-Most of the hype for this movie was fake, generated in spades via faux-amateurish Web sites and supposed 'fan' reviews actually generated by the 'filmmakers' and their friends. The glowing reviews? Fake (In fact, I'm willing to bet that half of the mini-reviews HERE are fakes - at least, the initial reviews; you'll notice that they soon become overwhelmingly negative, and that the people defending it become much fewer and farther between). While this practice is, of course, nothing new, I do not believe it has EVER worked as well as it has with 'Blair Witch Project' - the Artisan spin machine must have gone into overdrive when the folks there saw what a hideously bad movie they had on their hands. They are to be commended for successfully deceiving so many people.To sum up: This entire movie is a sham, made by untalented hacks and deceptively promoted. If you thought this was a 'groundbreaking' horror movie, then you obviously do not watch horror movies, nor are you aware of the elements that make a successful one (the reviewers who glowingly compare it to movies like 'Scream' are proof of that). If you identified with the characters - if you liked the movie at all - then you're an idiot.",3,1,3,9 January 2000
The Blair Witch Project," 'MTV' Horror...
","...and that's not a compliment. 'The Blair Witch Project' is right behind 'The Phantom Menace' as the year's most overrated movie.It's hard to say what this movie's BIGGEST problem is, but we can start with the characters, a trio of whiny, self-absorbed idiots that will absolutely annoy the crap out of you. Watching these clowns from a first-person perspective is like watching a feature-length 'Real World' episode (which is a terrifying proposition in itself). I, for one, was rooting for the witch, and it's hard to take the movie seriously when you WANT the ostensible heroes to die.Believability is also a huge problem, for one very simple reason: Nobody in their right mind would have continued filming as long as these people did. They just wouldn't, ESPECIALLY while running through the woods at NIGHT while in a state of complete panic. Now, this may sound like nitpicking, but in order for 'Blair Witch' to work we've got to BELIEVE that we're watching actual footage, taken in a situation and a state of mind as horrific as the students were in. It is simply beyond belief that they would have the presence of mind to continue filming as their situation becomes a fight for survival.And overall the movie was - dare I say? - boring. Just plain dull. I wasn't drawn into the situation; I wasn't even remotely scared until the last five minutes (after which the movie just stops - it doesn't end, it just STOPS), mainly because I was so tired of listening to the annoying main characters bicker. This is a tiresome movie.Now, I know this is supposed the be the 'scariest movie of all time'; I know I probably missed the point, that these people were SUPPOSED to be annoying (in order to appear more 'real'); that the production values were supposed to be incredibly cheap ('reality' again), and that the horror was supposed to be entirely SUGGESTED without us actually seeing anything scary, along with various other 'artistic' reasons that filmmakers like this feed us when they don't really feel like actually making a horror movie. All I know is, 'Blair Witch' is a waste of time. Go watch a movie that somebody actually put some effort into.",3,0,1,13 November 1999
American Beauty," Everything that's wrong with Hollywood, distilled into two horrible hours. Spoilers.
","Now, let me see if I've gotten this straight: 'Saving Private Ryan', an epic tale of honor, glory, and sacrifice set against the backdrop of what was possibly the most important single day of the Twentieth Century, was not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar.However, 'American Beauty', a movie whose heroes are a middle-aged pedophile who casually endangers the future of his family, and the next-door drug dealer who finds 'beauty' in people getting their brains blown out, is.I see.'American Beauty' might work as satire if 1.) it weren't telling us something we've KNOWN for fifty years - that the suburbs are not this perfect, 'Ozzie and Harriet' world of smiling, white-bread people - and 2.) if the characters depicted in the movie were in any way REALISTIC. Instead, 'American Beauty' is a parade of the most tiresome Hollywood cliches of the 1990s. I don't care how pathetic Spacey's and Bening's characters' lives are - would they really be THAT devoid of any redeeming values? Are we supposed to CHEER Spacey as he quits his job, smokes pot, and lusts after seventeen year-old girls, all to the detriment of his young daughter? Are we supposed to laugh at the ex-Marine's idea that the world NEEDS certain rules and standards in order to work? Clearly, we are. These are not characters at all, but ciphers. Indeed, the ex-Marine is one of the most laughable ciphers at all. He is the parody of the Evil Gun-Toting Gay-Bashing Right-Wing Military Nut, taken to its furthest extreme. As columnist John Leo recently put it, 'the only thing they forgot to do was to make him a tobacco company chemist and a trustee of a segregated college.' And the final revelation that the 'gay-basher' is in fact gay himself is the final piece of this Hollywood stereotype; a move meant purely to make sure this character and his world-view, that of the importance of morality and of the necessity of rules in society, is completely discredited.And I know, I know: I'm not reading between the lines. I need to 'look closer'. Well, I submit that those who glowingly praise this movie are looking TOO closely. It's easier to lose sight of the larger message a movie sends when you examine any one element too closely. And all that the people who made this movie have 'proved' is that they live on an entirely different planet from the hard-working, Joe and Jane America they claim to so brilliantly 'expose' - the same Joe and Jane America that keeps Hollywood in business.(Ordinarily, I'd rate a movie like 'American Beauty' about a '3'. But since it was without question both the most offensive AND the most overrated movie of 1999 (move over, 'The Phantom Menace'), and since more needs to be done to counterbalance these morons who think it's the next 'Citizen Kane', I feel I have no choice but to go with my original gut instinct and give it a big fat '1'. For years, I've made it a practice to save every ticket stub from every movie I've seen, regardless of its quality. Nevertheless, my 'American Beauty' ticket stub now sits in torn-up shreds at the bottom of the concession-area garbage can. It seemed a fitting gesture toward this Oscar-winning piece of putrescent pap.)",1,134,281,3 April 2000
Toy Story 2," Pixar Does it Again
","What words could do justice to this INCREDIBLE movie? Pixar, which topped the excellent original 'Toy Story' with last year's 'A Bug's Life', has, in turn, topped THAT. Like all the best animated films, 'Toy Story 2' works both at the child's and at the adult's level - and the result is 92 minutes of pure wonderment. SEE THIS MOVIE. Then see it again. Then see it again.",10,0,1,1 December 1999
