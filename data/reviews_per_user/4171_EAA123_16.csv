First Man," My Pilot's Review
","Being a pilot, I'm a sucker for any aviation/space related movie. The opening scene was great and it went downhill from there. This movie picks up where the Right Stuff leaves off, but fails to deliver the same perspective. From the Earth to the Moon, does a way better job of portraying Apollo 11. I thought Neil Armstrong's portrayal was bland and melancholy. Maybe that was true to life, but if that's so, why not tell us more about Buzz Aldrin who more interesting colorful character and contributed far more to the space program than almost anyone.",5,1,3,22 November 2018
A Star Is Born," Gaga for Gaga!
","I'm Gaga for Gaga so it wasn't too hard to like this movie. Also the performances form Bradley Cooper, Sam Elliott and Diceman were great,",8,4,7,14 October 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Lame!!
","LAME!! You'd think with subliminal messages like a death star planet killer weapon like the one that destroyed Mars, Mayan Pyramids, a Utah Data Center collecting all messages, phone calls and texts for the Empire, interesting parallel there, Triangle Mother ships, blah, blah, blah, that maybe they could've come up with a new story rather than copy the first movie with different characters?",5,5,9,19 March 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Really bad
","This has to be one of the worst scripts ever written. They took the best of all the movies and series and made a best of film with slight variations to the plots and using the excuse that they're in a different time line. They even brought back Kahn. Why even try to recreate Kahn? Ricardo Montalbans villain portrayal is one of the best in movie history. It's kinda like a band covering a #1 hit song. You can't do it any better than the original or expect it to be better than #1. Why even try? The special effects where great and the movie was somewhat entertaining, but I hate it when Hollywood takes a series and twists it around and doesn't stick to the original knowns. They ruined James Bond the same way. I'm a huge fan of Star Trek and I'd hope the new movies would have 'gone where no movie has gone before'.",7,3,9,21 August 2013
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Same repeated script again
","Maybe it's time to call Gene Roddenberry from the grave to write the next script!!! We have Star Trek, so who really needs another Star War!! hehehe",3,5,13,19 March 2020
American Hustle," Outstanding Movie
","Outstanding movie!! A must see!! I was never a Christian Bale fan, but I am now. He played the Jewish New Yorker to the tee and you would never guess he was from Australia!! Bradley Cooper keeps impressing me more and more every time I see one of his movies. I am a big fan. Amy Adams was so hot and sexy in this movie and you will fall in love with her character too. Jennifer Lawrence was outstanding as the Italian princess. She reminded me of some members of my family. Without a doubt all 4 actors best movie to date. The movie also portrayed the time period very well. I felt like I was back in that time period. De Niro's part was small, but another classic performance!!!",9,1,5,8 January 2014
Bohemian Rhapsody," nailed it!!
","Just loved the movie. Got to see Queen them once at MSG July 28, 1982. Awesome show. Rami Malek nailed it!",10,3,4,4 November 2018
54," Love this movie!!
","I've just finished watching the new extended version and love the new scenes. I was slightly disappointed not seeing the scenes from the director's cut I've heard so much about. I hope I get to see the director's cut sometime soon. Many thought the original was a flop and missing something. Having experienced the Disco era both as a DJ and a patron, I feel it's a true representation of the Disco era, the last era of true freedom. I also was fortunate enough to go Studio 54 myself. I've studied this movie for screen writing purposes. I've written a similar time period piece. Understanding the nuances of writing, I don't understand why important footage was left out just for time consideration. It wasn't too long to begin with. Personally I'd rather spend a few extra minutes seeing an entire uncut movie and getting the full experience. The love triangle scenes between Ryan Phillippe, Selma Hayek & Breckin Meyer may have been considered to risqué at the time the original movie was released, though is an accurate portrayal of the period. These scenes were left out this version as well. I gave the movie 10 stars and suggest everyone see it!! I also love the soundtrack and hats off to the cast!",10,0,0,5 April 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," Oscar worthy performance
","I went into this movie blind not knowing what to expect, but it blew me away. Mathew McConaughey's performance was reminiscent of De Niro's Raging Bull performance. Mathew McConaughey lost so much weight, making himself look so awful, you really believed he had aids. Oscar worthy performance if you ask me. This movie also had the time period down. Felt like I was really back there in that time period. You could truly feel the love/hate/friendship/relationship between Jared Leto's character and Mathew McConaughey's character. You loved and hated them both at times, but you knew they were designed to help each other. Jennifer Garner's performance was heartfelt as well.",10,4,6,8 January 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Such a great cast wasted!
",Pretty much all of Tarantino's movie have some great scenes with lot's of garbage. Tarantino is way overrated. What a waste of many talented actors,4,1,4,23 November 2019
Across the Universe," Loved it!!!
","I watched this because I saw Evan Rachel Wood was in and it was Beatles themed. I feared it might be to cheesy, but it wasn't. It was awesome. I grew up listening to the Beatles. I own every album, but admit I haven't listened to them much in recent years. I even saw them live on TV when I was very, very young. I even got to see Hendrix open up for the Monkees at Forest Hills. My uncle took me to see the Monkees, if I only knew what I know now.... I was only six.I liked the song selection of popular and obscure tracks. (if there's such a thing as an obscure Beatles song) I was hoping they would play my favorite, I Want You, She's So Heavy. I remember hearing that song when it first came out and was like this is cool!! I didn't think it would be in the movie, but it was!! Great scene for that song as well. That was one of the very first heavy metal songs. I think a few Beatles songs qualify for that title as well.",8,2,3,24 July 2019
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Loony Tunes
",What I like best about Home Alone is it's like Loony Tunes with people. The Roadrunner vs 2 dumb ass Coyotes!,8,1,3,11 December 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," Wasn't crazy about this movie
","Wasn't crazy about this movie. Just another copycat ripoff of Wall Street 1 & 2 and The Boiler Room to name a couple and even stole lines from Pretty Woman and the other two movies I mentioned. It is however a good example of how the con artist scumbags took advantage of poor people for personal gain and to a small degree exemplifies how the world economy has been trashed by these scumbags. They tried to make DiCaprio's character into a hero, but he wasn't It had a few funny moments. If you liked the last 2 Wall Street's as much as I did, you may be disappointed in this. I haven't liked Scorsese's last two movies, oddly enough they both had DiCaprio in them, lol. He seems to keep playing the same guy and with a different twist and I am a fan of DiCaprio......",8,5,10,8 January 2014
Arrival," Not only the worst UFO movie of all time, the worst movie of all time!!
","Not only the worst UFO movie of all time, the worst movie of all time!! Meanwhile the members of IMDb gave it 8.3 of 10 stars. What a waste of 47 million dollars! I guess Paramount is laughing all the way to the bank since as of today they've doubled their money. Somebody has to pay for the producers Audi's and house......No one can seem to get it right when it comes to the UFO subject. The aliens in this were ridiculous looking, looked like giant octopus's and even squirted out ink to write on a wall. The story is full of holes and is extremely weak. Most of it made no sense. The only good thins was Amy Adams. Hopefully she'll do a better job of choosing her roles in the future!",1,9,18,19 January 2017
Midway," Not bad
","Not sure if this was a necessary remake, but not bad for an almost exact remake of the original 1976 Midway. Not sure if they used actual WWII footage like the original or if it was great special effects, but a couple of the carrier crash landings looked like actual WWII footage. I like some of the casting choices like Woody. I felt the original showed more of the strategy of both the US and the Japanese. Overall I liked and the modern flight scenes, but close the canopy! From a real pilots perspective, you'd freeze your ass off in reality!! lol. This applies to a lot of aviation movies since the invention of the movie camera. Tom Cruise didn't fly with his canopy open!!",7,0,0,18 January 2020
Flight," Outstanding!!
","Outstanding, A must see. Being a pilot myself I'm a little bias, but the movie rocks da house!!! The flying scenes are some of the best I've ever seen and the story is based on truth. The special effects are the best I've seen since the airplane crash in Castaway. Denzel Washington does an outstanding job playing a maverick type airline captain and John Goodman delivers an hysterical performance as well. The subject matter addresses a number of pilot issues and safety issues which need to be brought out in the open. Hopefully this movie will make government agencies push for stricter guidelines. The crash cause is based on reality from a crash off the California coast near Point Mugu.",10,0,4,24 December 2012
