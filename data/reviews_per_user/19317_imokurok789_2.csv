The Expendables 2," phoning it in
","Absolutely mediocre. Not completely bad enough to be fun, not good enough to be entertaining. In the interest of full disclosure - I enjoyed the first movie (The Expendables).There is so much implausible stuff going on it's hard to decide what to comment on.The characters are stiff. It looks like nobody had fun making this and they wish they were somewhere else doing something else.It feels like those old Hollywood movies where the actors show up, stand on their marks, read their lines, and drink heavily after to deal with the frustration. Really a shame considering how much talent was lined up for this.The feeble attempts at nuance just make it that much more painful.If you liked the sequels of other titles like Anaconda, Halloween, and Pirranah, you might really like this one.",1,2,4,6 November 2012
Iron Man 3," If you have to lie mislead people to get them into the theater, why bother to make the movie?
","The previews looked great. Had they been an accurate representation of the movie it could have been terrific. For $200 million, it seems like they could have shot the movie shown in the trailers. What else was lame?1. The suit now can disassemble itself and the pieces can fly across the country to reassemble and still be fully charged up and battle ready. The suits can fight on their own. The pieces can fight on their own. They can protect everybody. About the 100th time we see this I find myself looking at my watch and wishing I was mowing the lawn, or sleeping, or at work, or sleeping at work, anything. What is the point of Stark or anyone else ever putting the suit on again and risking getting killed when they can be remotely operated and even autonomous if Stark is busy making dinner or something? Stark doesn't even need to show up for the next movie, he can just tell Jaris to send some suits to kill everybody. Of course, who needs the suits when we have Super-Stark - see next item.2. Tony Stark has gone from middle aged guy w/ a heart condition, a slight paunch, and a huge brain to a CG enabled super-dooper martial arts one-man A-Team/McGiver hybrid with 10+ invincibility. How many times can Stark leap into the air, fall 50 feet and land on a catwalk while blasting caps at baddies and not splatter all over the pavement? It seemed like it went on forever.3. At his house, he stores 40+ suits with the power pack thingys that caused so much trouble in the first movie when Stane got ahold of ONE, yet apparently he can't even keep bad girls from driving up to his front door, much less any kind of protection from a couple of choppers lobbing rockets at him. Oops, the genius weapons manufacturer missed that one Couldn't have even one of those suits on standby to protect the crib? He's obsessed with keeping Pepper safe, but he misses this?4. Final big battle scene with literally everything thrown in thanks to a sad, sad over-reliance on CG. CG should enhance a good movie, not compensate for laziness.5. If the 40+ suits are un-manned, why bother to make them man-shape? Wouldn't there be much more efficient configurations? Are they all man- shape just in case Stark might want to get in them some time? Really? All 40+? Am I the only one that thinks that's kinda creepy?Creates a lot of problems when these clowns insist on hitting certain points in the movie even if they make zero sense. Why? Do they think most people that would go to see an Iron Man movie are too stupid to catch them? And there's usually a final 'epic' battle scene with so much nonsense going on it can't help but disconnect the viewer and remind them they are watching a movie. Is it 'Death by Focus Group'? 'This is all the things the focus groups said they like in movies, so let's throw it ALL in EVERY movie we make and we can't lose!!' If you're a big fan, it's probably a given that you'll see it. I'd suggest waiting a few weeks and renting it for a dollar. More than that and you too will wish you waited. Won't make this mistake again.",4,3,6,4 May 2013
