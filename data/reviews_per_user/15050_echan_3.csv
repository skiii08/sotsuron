The Devil's Advocate," Keanu Reeves
","I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves, and that's why I hired this movie. Even though Keanu was playing the main character, his role wasn't enough to to bring his acting skills and talent into full play. Charlize the babe didn't do much except taking off her clothes either. Al Picino did well, but he's already a good actor. No surprise there.",6,1,2,4 April 1999

Face_Off," John Woo really hit it off
","There's everything in this film.Maybe it's too soon to say this, but I haven't seen any action film as exciting as this one before.The drama. I don't think many actors out there are able to switch roles like that so perfectly.The action. From the beginning to the end. Sometimes it's heavy enough to stop your heart pumping.The directing. John Woo really impressed me. He used every possible way, sound effects, lighting, special effects, camera positions and angles to increase tension and impact. His previous film Broken Arrow impressed me enough already, but in this one he's even more incredible. No wonder why he's famous.However I only gave it an eight. Simply because my brother doesn't like it as much as I do, but he doesn't have any reasons for it. *shrug* Maybe he thinks it's too cruel, but that's what turns me on.",8,1,2,3 April 1999
