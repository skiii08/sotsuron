Requiem for a Dream," Unbelievably powerful
","Darren Aronofsky has yet done it again, Pi is amazing but Requiem is one of the most depressing, powerful, disgusting films I have seen that messes up ones mind, brilliant. Lets hope he can amaze us with the newest installment into the Batman films.",10,0,0,4 October 2001
Evil Dead II," The best gore infested film...
","I love low budget, stop frame animation and action man hero style characters..Evil Dead 2 has it all...from living hands to dancing dead girlfriends..you have to love it for its originality whole cabin/forest setting..this was the film that made me explore a whole new film genre...realistic low budget horror..it's the best!!!",10,0,0,3 July 1999
