Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Let's just say you'll be 'Forced' to see it again!!!
","This Movie was great!!!! Although not as good as the original Trilogy this movie still got ranked as a 10 in the IMDb, because of the stunning Lightsaber duels, space battles, and ground  based battles included in the movie.  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through, I won't spoil it for anyone but some of the surprises were sudden and entertaining to keep the viewer into the movie the whole way through. Although I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, it does require you to have seen Episodes 4, 5, and 6 because of the lack of character development in characters seen in that movie.  I plan on seeing this movie at least 10 times before it leaves the theaters.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
