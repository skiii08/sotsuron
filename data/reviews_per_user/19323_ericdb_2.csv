Antz," Enjoyable, impressive, but slow.
","While I no longer have young children in my home, after seeing advertisements for ANTZ I would probably have left the wee ones at home.My wife and I were very entertained by the animation, especially the attention paid to the details.  The Chamber scenes were breathtaking, as were the scenes by the 'Lake'.The characterizations were, for the most part brilliant.  Woody Allens talents were effectively used and brought more than a few laughs to myself and the audience I viewed the movie with.The only real complaint I have was the tempo of the story.  It started out well, but 30 minutes into the film it slowed.  The brakes were only on for a short time as we moved into the last quarter of the film.  The military coup in the colony as led by Gene Hackmans, Gen. Mandible was very entertaining, and the resuce of the colony by Z and Cutter was a master stroke of story writing.All in all, I rather enjoyed this film and look forward to more releases from this studio.",8,0,0,21 October 1998
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Stunning visuals, great effects, familiar story.
","As someone who saw Star Wars: A New Hope when it opened in 1977, I have to say that I rather enjoyed this latest installment to the Star Wars films. In my humble opinion, it did live up to the hype.  I found the special effects to be the best that I have ever seen on film.  Is there nothing that cannot now be done on film!?! The only real criticism though, was that I found myself sitting there going, 'okay, now they blow the death star...no that's the droid control ship, or now it's time for the throne room scene...scrap that, it's a victory parade.' Regardless, my wife and I greatly enjoyed ourselves and have decided to see it at least one more time.  After all we're not 16 anymore! Oh one other thing, where was Han......?",8,0,0,20 May 1999
