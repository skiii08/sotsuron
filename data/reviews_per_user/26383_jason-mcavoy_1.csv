Insidious: Chapter 2," Good But Not As Good As The Original
","This film was an excellent movie, although it didn't meet up to the standards of the original. I loved this movie but the problem was I just couldn't stand the fact that it was worse than the original. I hated the ending it was unbelievably daft. The jump scares were slightly better than the originals, but they didn't scare me as much as the originals did. I wanted to like the film more than I did, but it would be better if they had a redeeming story line. Continuing the story on from the end of the original was a good idea, but having the Main protagonist being stuck in the 'Further' just wasn't the best of ideas, and then having him escape at the end... It was just a massive let down. I would have much preferred the film going on with the main protagonist in real life and not stuck in 'The Further' for the entire movie. In conclusion this was a good movie, but just not as good as I had hoped for, although I would much rather have the same sought of scares the Original had.",7,0,0,13 February 2014
