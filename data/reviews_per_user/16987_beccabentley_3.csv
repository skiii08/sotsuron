The Ring," Truly terrifying stuff!!
","My husband took me to see this film and when he said it was a horror I was expecting to sit through another of his kind of horror films i.e.stupid teenagers with lots of gratuitous blood, guts and violence thrown in. I was fortunately very mistaken! I have not seen the original 'Ringu', which everyone keeps harping on about, but I am glad I saw this first as it is good not to have anything to compare it to. Taken by itself, I think it is a fantastic film. It's not everyone's cup of tea and the usual horror fans may think it slow, incomprehensible or just plain unscary. However, I loved the mystery and weirdness of it.It begins a bit like your typical American nonsense with two teenage girls chatting and the conversation coming around to a videotape that is supposed to kill people that watch it. My first thought was: how 'urban legend'ish and ridiculous!! However, as the film went on, it clearly had a darker, more powerful and very much more thought provoking aspect. The images on the videotape itself are so 'nightmarish', in that disjointed and freaky way that real nightmares can be. They really got under my skin anyway and I actually came to believe in the power the tape had to kill. You  wonder how on earth Rachel is going to escape the same fate as the others and I felt real horror and despair on her discovery that Aidan has also watched the tape.One thing that I think really robs horror films of their ultimate 'horror' value is when you come to the explanation/discovery of what's behind it all at the end. I thought the film had let itself down with a typical, rationalised ending. I was very pleasantly surprised with the horrifying twist that developed and I loved the eerie 'non-ending' ending - it left me really freaked out and actually believing that the whole thing might be real after all. It is wonderful, psychologically terrifying stuff and I defy anyone to watch it and forget it - I am still thinking about it and giving myself the shivers months later! I won't give any film 10/10, as this is the ultimate and I am always challenging for there to be an even better film out there (this film does exist and is Ringu if everyone else's comments are anything to go by). I give it a superior 'must see' 9/10.",9,72,103,5 June 2003
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Surprisingly good!
","This film was a cinema treat for my mum as she fancied seeing it on her birthday. I had no clue going in what it was about. And if I had to describe it afterwards to someone, I'm sure it wouldn't sound like a particularly amazing film. The story wasn't terribly exciting but the characters made the story so moving and gripping. The acting by everyone in it was superb. Not a big fan of all the bad language but it did make the film feel more grittily real. I usually prefer more fantastical films which give some escapism but I surprised myself and the film itself surprised me. Sam Rockwell (whom I have liked since The Green Mile) was such a dislikeable character but the way he developed through the film was really well done. The film plays well on your emotions and somehow manages to bring little bits of humour out of a tragic situation and some appalling decisions. I still smile thinking about my favourite bit when Sam Rockwell's character shies away a little bit from his lighter (because of what has happened to him - I won't spoil it by saying what). It doesn't sound funny here but he makes even a small thing like this funny. The film makes you think about how inherently decent people can make bad or good choices and what the unexpected consequences can be. I wasn't too sure about the ending but I suppose it left the viewer to decide for themselves what happened next. I would say this film definitely deserves some oscars.",9,4,8,3 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," More like a rehash than a revival of this series
","I love the star wars films especially the originals. I was expecting a lot from this one as it was at last the 'newest' episode. I wanted to be amazed and reinspired. I liked the idea of a defecting stormtrooper and I like the new Jedi girl. However the film was spoilt by too many repeating themes...a new and bigger death star? Really? A son/father, one dark side, one good? An old, wrinkly looking alien (like Yoda) who seems to know everything? The Empire basically renamed as The First order. The leader- masked, cloaked and in black (just without the heavy breathing)? Han solo back to being a smuggler for no apparent reason? It felt as though the writers felt they had to do almost a remake of the very first film just to get younger viewers up to speed. There was also no explanation for so many things e.g. why were they all looking for Luke? Why had no-one done anything about the new death star before it became functional? Why do they seem to have gone backwards in 30 years? Why has Han's and Leia's son gone to the dark side and why aren't they together? It was spoilt even more when Kylo Ren took his mask off..he just looked like some haughty student. He just was not scary any more. This disappointed me almost as much as when darth vader was unmasked in return of the jedi (never got over how ugly Anakin was!) Spoiler: and when Kylo Ren killed his father it just seemed so unnecessary and meaningless. Did the writers just think oh yeah we will make it like the opposite of when Luke fights his father. As we had no back-story for it, it just felt like a cheap trick. I have still given the film 5 because despite all this i enjoyed quite a lot of it. Liked the effects, liked the humour and I did like seeing all the old characters again. My kids were thoroughly entertained. Just a pity it did not live up to all it could and should have been.",5,12,15,29 March 2016
