The Incredible Hulk," Just Beautiful!
","I can't help but say that I liked this version better than 'Hulk'! It stuck really close to the comic book. I liked 'Hulk' but it strayed a bit and they didn't stick to the personalities and physiques of the characters. In 'Hulk' Eric Bana portrayed Bruce, and although his acting was impeccable, he was wrong for the part. Bruce and the Hulk are supposed to be complete opposites. But Eric Bana doesn't look the part of a potential 'science-nerd'. He almost looks like Hulk. Now, in The Incredible Hulk', Edward Norton played the part very well. He has the ability to look like a geek which would be hulks opposite. The graphics in the movie are brilliant. And of course the ending opens the door to the next chapter. Hopefully we will see the uniting of the Ultimate Alliance!",10,6,10,2 November 2008
Iron Man," Totally fits the profile!
","This movie fits the comic book extremely well, all the way down to Tony Stark's personality! So If you like the comic genre movies that stick closely to the real story, you'll love this one! As for Rober Downey Jr., he was made for this role! He is finally going to get the recognition he deserves! The CGI is amazing and the wit is utterly adorable. Gweneth played Pepper perfectly as she always does. And you can't help but hate Jeff Bridges from the very beginning! You love him as an actor which makes hating him all the more perfect. I can't wait until the next movie! Hopefully we'll see the whole team unite. I have a feeling the Ultimate Alliance is not far behind! But I wonder, who could play Captain America?!",10,0,1,2 November 2008
