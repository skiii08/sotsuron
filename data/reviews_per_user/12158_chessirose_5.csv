"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Like the coolest movie!!!!
","OMG, this movie is sooo cool!   I just watched and fell in love with it! Everyone in this movie is so great!  Guy Pearce is so well...  annoying yet funny!  He is awesome in this, totally different from the Time Machine and Memento.  And, Hugo Weaving is very good.  Some what scary in the costumes, though.  Another totally different roll for him then in The Matrix and Lord of the Rings.  And, also Terrance Stamp!  He is so good as the 'women' of the bunch!  Very good performance by him, I liked him much better in this then in Superman 2.  Costumes are awesome too, actually they won the Academy Award for them.  On a note for parents...  This movie does use the 'F-word' a few too many times, and there are many sexual references (which is kinda a duh because they are drag queens and transvestites).  But over all it's a pretty fun film. Oh and for the Guy Pearce fans (like me)...  Just be prepared for a fun ride, with a interesting drag queen...  hehe For the grade for this movie I give it a 9/10...  Which is an A in my book ^_^",10,1,2,3 April 2002
Minority Report," Really Awesome!!!
","This movie is really awesome.  First off the acting by Tom Cruise is really good and Colin Farrel is really goo for his part.  Second, the direction is really good.   Steven Speilberg does a really good job, as always.  The special effects are good, espically the little spider things.   Sound effects and sound, really good.   The plot was different and made you think alot, but is still explained even if you dont get every little thing. Good editing, Michael Kahn rocks!!! The movie is the best film of this year so far.  Will get stuff at the Oscars for best orignal score (John Williams does the score.  And, sound effects editing and sound effects, visual effects, cinematograpy, and maybe actor in a lead (Cruise) and director. Over all 9/10 go see it!",9,0,0,21 June 2002
The Shining," I dont get why everybody thinks this is so good?
","Ok, honestly I dont see why everybody thinks this is so great.  Its really not.  There were two good things that came out of this movie 1.  Jack's performance, he was very good I can tip my hat for him.  2.  Danny's performance, he was good.  No other then that it got pretty stupid.  And, what was Stanley Kubrick thinking drafting Shelly as the Wendy?   She was so bad.  She looked the same every time she got scared.  The problem with this movie was the ending.  I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently.  And, the over all movie was just stupid.  The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better.  So dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off.  3/10.",1,15,34,8 October 2001
Vanilla Sky," Interesting and yes I mean that in a good way!
","***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** Okay, if you guys have read any of my other reviews you know that I'm a Tom Cruise Freak!  So, I just had to go see it the day it came out which was today! This movie is totally awesome and it really had me thinking and thinking and thinking.  So please allow me to go on a rant about the characters... David Aames or the nickname of the century Citizen Dildo... Tom Cruise... David is a very deep and interesting character, and is the main focus in the movie.  Cruise does a great job playing David.  **Somewhat Spoiler But nothing you probably havent all ready heard**  I thought after David got in the car accident with Julie and I saw how badly he was disfigured I thought I was gonna die!  The make up was awesome and Cruise really did do a awesome job as David. Sophia Serrano... Penelope Cruz...  Sopfia has a great attitude and is very willing to succeed.  She is very supportive of David when his face is disfigured.  A good person, in my opinion.  And, Tom and Penelope really do have a great on screen relationship, you can really tell they're in love.Julie Gianni... Cameron Diaz...  Wow, she's a real bad girl in this movie! What a b*tch and man do I mean it!!!!  Now, in my opinion I think that its great that David went for Sophia and not Julie because she is just too damn controlling over him!   Everyone will agree with me about it.  But, she does have some good songs on the sound track. McCabe...  Kurt Russel...  If you will he is a father figure for David a lot of the time, and Russel's performance at the end it very good and is totally awesome. Now for the story itself...  Well, if you like this I totally recommend Memento.  The story is complex and very deep.  And, truely had me thinking throughout the whole movie.  And, this is great this is what makes me love this movie...  They actually explain everything!!!!  Yes, at the end they explain everything and don't leave you hanging!!!!!   That's why its so great!!!! The set up is great, story complex, and strong.Now the sound track, is also very good and Paul McCartney's 'Vanilla Sky,' best song on the whole soundtrack.  Must buy! The thing that is very cool in VS is that the mood is very good, and actually Cameron Crowe {director} played music on the set to set the mood. It really showed. Now, this is the one thing that I thought was totally cool...  Was the theme of dreams...  This was really cool.  Because I have bad dreams a lot and I totally felt connected with David throughout the movie.  Okay I have been dubbed weird now.  But, they're are many themes in this wonderful movie.Okay now heres what I give the movie 10/10.  Once again Crowe and Cruise deliver a wonderful movie.  Oh and by the way Tom produced this movie too...Totally recommended!!!! And, yes I must put this... TOM CRUISE ROCKS!!!!",10,0,1,14 December 2001
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," VERY FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!
","The movie Interview With the Vampire is very funny, and is a good dark comedy.  It has serious moments but over all, to me it was very funny.  If you're a Tom Cruise, or Brad Pitt fan or even just think that they're cute this a good movie to watch!  I think that Tom Cruise does a wonderful job playing Lestat, and Brad Pitt playing Louis is quite good.  There are many serious parts, but over all there are also alot of funny parts to make the balance.  And, Tom Cruise w/ blonde hair is quite funny.  And, you'll never believe the ending it is soooooo funny!  TOM CRUISE RULZ!",10,1,2,11 May 2001
