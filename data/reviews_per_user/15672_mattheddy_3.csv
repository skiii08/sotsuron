Blade Runner 2049," Better than the first
","I found this one to be so much better than the first one. The characters actually had depth. They give you more backstory on the replicants. The did a good job of building the world/universe the film's take place in. The film did tend to feel like it was dragging at certain points. However each scene contributed to the story as a whole and I though they did a great job with this. I see a lot of mixed reviews and it seems those that liked the first movie tend to not like this one. I say get over yourself, this film was hands down way better than the first. Just because the original Blade Runner set the tone for Cyberpunk movies doesn't mean it is the best. I actually found the first one quite painful to watch. This one was much better. They showed you how much stronger and durable the replicants are than humans. The replicants were much more deadly in this film. I feel like this movie made you think about what it is to be human and was much more thought provoking than the first. I also found the story itself was laid out way better than the first movie. Overall good movie. Glad I watched it because I almost didn't after watching the first one.",8,1,12,15 September 2019
Midsommar," If you have almost 3 hours to waste and nothing better to do...don't watch this
","I really wish I would've read some reviews before I watched this movie. It was honestly very annoying. Great cinematography, decent scenery and costumes. Also some pretty good acting. However the main characters bored me. The female lead really got on my nerves. I almost turned the movie off about 20 mins in because one scene just kept going with abnoxious screaming. The movie really does drag on very slowly and you can pretty much guess everything that is going to happen. I wouldn't recommend it. It's not really horror, just strange, with some gore. The director tries to make it a deep movie about love, family, and loneliness and in my opinion failed. It was just bad, but hey that's my opinion and isn't worth much. It was a waste of almost three hours. I'm really upset I spent my evening watching this movie.",1,21,36,9 November 2019
Blade Runner," Painful to watch
","This movie is extremely slow! I could appreciate that if there was some great story telling going on. However it's not really clear what the hell is going on.Harrison Ford is just walking around looking confused. Shoots a lady that I think was a robot, then he practically raped another robot after she saved his life. You see the antagonist only twice in the first hour of the film. He goes to his creator asking for more life since the replicates only live for 4 years, then he kills him. Seems counter productive to me. Ford's character has another run in with the other lady bot and that was honestly laughable. What the hell was that? Then the showdown with the main antagonist, again laughable. I really was expecting so much more from this film. But I find it really hard to watch.I feel like everyone giving this movie high ratings is clinging to older styles of film making and trying to make this some philosophical masterpiece but I just don't see it. Then there are those saying this is so good because it doesn't use special effects and recent sci fi movies are full of bad cgi. There are plenty of sci-fi film's that have way better story lines and make you ponder life regardless of good or bad cgi. And how does a film not using cgi or special effects automatically make it a good film? This whole story is just blah. I'm really so confused why this has such a high rating. It's in my opinion very tough to watch. I feel like they could have done so much more with this film. Don't get me wrong it is visually appealing especially for being made in the early 80's but that's about the extent of the pros with this movie.I'm watching this movie because I wanted some background before I watch Blade Runner 2049, I just hope the story telling and pacing are better than this one.",3,8,15,15 September 2019
