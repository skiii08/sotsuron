The Rock," Awesome action movie
","Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage give very cool performances as an ex-con and a scientist who them and a group of soldiers go to Alcatraz to thwart a person's attempt to send a nuke to destroy some major damage.  Ed Harris plays the bad guy and he was cool as him and I enjoyed him very much.  The action in this was too cool and some stuff got me queezy but most was just awesome.  The coolest part ,no doubt, was the guy sent off by a rocket. That was really cool.  All sorts of other parts were cool too.  The directing was great.  Everything was great.Overall I love this movie and I found no flaws in this and I recommend this to anyone who likes action.  Rating 10 out of 10.",10,2,2,23 May 2002
Scarface," Great story of drug underworld
","Al Pacino is excellent as Tony Montana, a poor man who soon enough, becomes rich after Miami's cocaine underworld.  Al Pacino really shines in this one. Brian DePalma directs a true gem here.  He made himself known again for this.  Oliver Stone is excellent for his work in this amazing movie, too.Overall the whole movie is brilliantly made and perfect.  Rating 10 out of 10.",Null,0,1,2 June 2002
Ali," how could Voight be nominated?
","Ali is a great movie following the real life events of Muhommad Ali, the greatest.  Will Smith, Jamie Foxx, Jon Voight, and Mario van Peebles give great performances as who they have to portray.  I think it's ridiculous that Jon Voight got nominated for an Academy Award.  Of anybody, Jamie Foxx or Mario van Peebles should have.  Jon Voight was still good but not amazing.Overall the movie is a good boxing and biography movie and Will Smith rocks. Rating 10 out of 10.",Null,0,2,3 June 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Amazing movie
","Harrison Ford definitely made a name for himself when he made this one. Raiders of the Lost Ark is an excellent movie from every angle.  Steven Spielberg made an excellent movie, here.  The acting between the rest of the cast is great and I enjoyed the characters.  The fight sequences in this are really good and i especially like the scene with the swordsman.  Jones just pulls his gun out and shoots him.  Hilarious.Overall the movie is amazing on many levels.  Can't wait for the 4th one. Rating BIG 10 out of 10.",Null,0,0,2 June 2002
Minority Report," Fantastic!
","I've recently had the chance to go to a private screening of the brand new film, Minority Report.  The movie stars Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, and Max von Sydow.  The direction is by the absolutely wonderful Steven Spielberg. When I came out of the screening, I couldn't wait to see it on opening day of June, 21st.  Here's my review:I've got to say, this is a fantastic film.  Steven Spielberg is great at the direction seat and he definitely directed a true gem. The movie follows a cop who has such great technology, that he can catch future criminals before they actually commit the crime.  The tables are now turned on him and he's in the run for his life to prove that he is not going to commit a crime. I guess the movie's a little bit predictable, but for the most part, it's good enough.  The movie's basically like a Blade Runner (futuristic setting) of our time.  it doesn't have the same plot or nothing but a futuristic vibe. I definitely want the Lexus in the future that Tom Cruise drives.Tom Cruise proves once again that he knows how to act and this may be one of his best movies since Rain Man.  I've seen Colin Farrell in Hart's War and in that, I guess he proved something.  But in this one, he proves he can act even better.  The last time I've ever saw Max von Sydow was in needful Things and in that he played the devil.  In this he's a little nicer.  He does good in this.Overall the movie is great and Tom Cruise and Steven Spielburg should work together more often.  The action sequences are great.  I think that this could be another summer blockbuster.  Highly recommended.  Rating 10 out of 10.",1,1,5,12 June 2002
Training Day," Best movie of '00s
","Denzel Washington deserved his Academy Award in this.  Ethan Hawke should've won an Academy Award for this.  This should've won Best Picture.  This has to be one of the coolest, greatest movies I've ever seen in my entire life. The acting is excellent and unbelieveable in this awesome movie.  They actually were allowed to be filmed in a gang's neighborhood with gangsters starring in it.  Big named actors and actresses star in this and they all make it work.  Denzel Washington is the best villain in a movie I've ever seen.Overall the whole movie works and the direction, acting, etc. are excellent. There is no movie that will top this in the '00s.  Rating 11 out of 10. (Favorite Movie of '00s)",10,2,13,1 June 2002
Fight Club," Awesome movie
",Brad Pitt is great as Tyler Durden in this wonderful movie.  Edward Norton is also very cool and I enjoyed the fight...with himself.  he should have won best fight for MTV video movie awards.  The directing was on top of it all and the acting is just perfect.  I also enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter.  I have never seen Brad Pitt like this and I think it is good to see him act like this.  He acted very well.  Same with Edward Norton who just got out of his nazi American History X fame.Overall the movie was very cool and just possibly the best movie of 1999. The acting and directing were just awesome.  rating 10 out of 10.,10,0,1,23 May 2002
As Good as It Gets," Amazingly good movie
","I was very surprised of this movie.  I didn't know what to expect from this but I was surprised at how good it is.  Jack Nicholas plays very good as Melvin,  a bigtime jerk who seems to aggravate everyone.  Helen Hunt is good as the single mother and I enjoyed her very much.  Greg Kinnear is probably the most convincing performance of a homosexual I have ever seen.  This is probably one of his best performances.Overall I was still surprised and very happy about this movie.  It had solid performances and I was pleased.  Rating 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,21 May 2002
The Rookie," Excellent!
","This movie has to be the greatest movie of 2002 up to date.  This movie was absolutely wonderful.  Sure it's a Disney movie but this one is great. Dennis Quaid portrays Jim Morris, a High School science teacher and the coach of the school baseball team whose dream since he was a kid was to be a professional baseball player.  His team makes a bet with him that if they win the district, he tries out for Major League Baseball.  He agrees to the bet and the rest of the movie is history.  If you know the true life story of Jimmy Morris than you would probably know what happens during the movie. I won't spoil it for you by telling you what happens.The performances were extremely well.  Dennis quaid is the heart of the story.  Every time he is in it is absolutely great.  Rachel Griffiths, who portrays Lorri Morris, is also very good.  Angus T. Jones plays Jim and Lorri's son, Hunter.  His performance was good enough and I think he is supposed to be a comic relief.  He made smile a few times.  Brian Cox and Beth Grant are very well and I enjoyed them through the entire movie.  The actors who play Jim Morris's baseball team, such as Jay Hernandez and Rick Gonzalez, are cool and probably the best actors to portray the players. Trevor Morgan is good playing young Jim Morris but he wasn't onscreen long enough to show Jim's childhood.Overall this movie is good for the entire family and anyone who knows the story of Jim Morris or is a fan of baseball, I definitely suggest this movie.  Rating 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,11 May 2002
The Mummy," Excellent action movie
","The Mummy is an excellent action and adventure movie, with a little comedy in it.  Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz do great together and I liked them as a team.  John hannah provides the comic relief part and he was pretty dang funny.  Arnold Voosloo is great as the evil mummy/villain of the movie and I thought he was very cool.Overall the movie is very excellent with one flaw.  Torches last quite long in pyramids don't they?  Rating 10 out of 10.",Null,0,0,2 June 2002
Home Alone," Entertaining
",Home Alone is a very entertaining film about a boy who gets left behind for a vacation and must fend off robbers.  Machauley Caulkin is great as Kevin and very enjoyable.  Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are perfect as the robbers.Overall the movie is a great entertaining film and I recommend it.  Rating 9 out of 10.,Null,0,1,15 June 2002
Insomnia," Good movie but very slow paced
","* A minor plot spoiler ahead *Just imagine walking on the set of Law and Order with Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, Nicky Katt, and others.  They're on the trail of a man who murdered a 17-year-old girl.  When bad comes to worse, Al Pacino and the killer are in a chase in the fog.  When Al Pacino thinks he sees the killer, he shoots. It ends up being one of his partners.  Now, the only person who knows the killing is Al Pacino and the murderer.  I'm not going to tell anymore of the movie but you will enjoy it.  The movie lacks any suspense whatsoever and their are hardly any tense situations.  The movie can get very slow paced at times.  That is probably the only thing that may have aggravated me.  The performances were outstanding.  These performances should definitely be remembered in the Oscar Nomination.  Al Pacino did an excellent job as the detective on the trail of the killer.  Robin Williams did great as the hidden character.  he was only heard on the phone in the first half but in the second half he was wonderful.  Hilary Swank does good as her part and I enjoyed her every second on-screen.Overall the movie could be slow paced at times but overall the movie is very good but the storyline could have been a little bit better.  Rating 9 out of 10.",10,0,0,24 May 2002
X-Men," Great movie
","I'm not a true fan of the X-Men comic books but I did happen to like this movie. I thought that this movie is a really cool movie. i enjoyed the performances of Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, Ian McKellan, and Patrick Stewart. They all did really good as the characters they had to play.Overall the movie is a great movie from beginning to end and it is very enjoyable. Rating 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,6 June 2002
The Terminator," Excellent action
","Cameron has created a masterpiece with this one.  He really did this one right.  The acting was perfect especially from Arnold.  He was good.  Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were also really good.  They were all cast perfect for their characters.  The plot is good.  A terminator from the future to kill a woman who is soon going to have a baby that, apparently, the terminator does not want.  The bar scene was really cool.  The collision with the semi and the ending was great. Overall the movie was superb and the directing, acting, special effects, etc. were awesome.  Rating 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,22 May 2002
We Were Soldiers," Good war movie
","This is not the best war movie but it is still good.  The only problem was the grossness of the scorched guy's body and that their was no happiness from what I remember in the whole movie.  And since when have people keep calling people pussies in the war.  They make it sound like present-day language.  How come when grenades blow up a foot away from a person they just blow back instead of blowing to bits and pieces.  It was still good, though.  Mel Gibson and Chris Klein were excellent as their portrayals of the soldiers.  The action is very good and the other actors were very good.Overall the entire movie is great with some bit too much gore and no happiness.  Rating 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,30 May 2002
Scary Movie 2," hilarious
","When I first saw this movie, I was expecting a not that bad movie with unbelievable gross out jokes.  I was right and wrong.  I was right about the unbelievably sick jokes and wrong about the not that bad movie.  This was awesome!  Sure some jokes were just dumb and the trash-talking parrot didn't help this movie but it was still very funny.  The opening part was a hysterical riot.  James Woods and Andy Richter were great as the two priests in the beginning.  Shawn and Marlon are really awesome in this.  keenan Ivory Wayans directed a true gem.Overall the whole movie is mostly excellent with minor flaws.  Rating 10 out of 10.",Null,0,1,5 June 2002
Alien," Awesome
",I enjoyed the heck out of this movie mainly because of the plot line.  I have to say though that the acting is wonderful.  It set off James Cameron's career and it is a good one.  I know he can direct very well and Sigourney Weaver and Tom Skeritt are awesome.  Yaphet Kotto and John Hurt are very cool in this.  The special effects are over the top. Overall this movie is way to cool and set off Cameron's career and the wonderful sequel Aliens.  Too bad Jason X copied off of the entire movie. Rating 10 out of 10.,9,0,1,20 May 2002
Malcolm X," Excellent
","Denzel Washington is absolutely amazing as Malcolm X, an influental and controversial black leader that moved a nation.  Spike Lee directs this perfectly and he proves he can direct wonderfully.  All of the other actors and actresses in this portray their characters perfectly and they were all awesome.  The only problem was not with this movie, but with MTV's video movie awards.  Now what kind of idiots try to spoof an influental black leader and that is so idiotic that they would do that.Overall the movie is awesome and I think that Denzel should have won the Oscar.  Rating 10 out of 10.",10,3,10,27 May 2002
Glory," Excellent war movie
","Matthew Broderick is awesome as the white leader of the 54th regiment.  The movie is a civil war movie and I've really never seen a war movie like this before.  This is just perfect.  The acting is wonderful, especially from Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington,  Cary Elwes, and Morgan Freeman.  They were all great and they filled their characters with all sorts of potential and left nothing behind of their character.  If they could all win Academy Awards I would be much happier.  At least Denzel Washington won the Best Supporting Actor.Overall this is an absolutely wonderful war movie and I recommend this to anyone who likes war movies or just anyone.  Rating 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,24 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Overrated
","For some strange reason, the characters don't seem to have any bit of their hearts into the movie.  With the exception of Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan McGregor, the rest of the cast has bad dialogue or bad acting.  Natalie Portman was super hot in this but her chemistry with Christenson was OK. The fight scenes were awesome.  Incredible.  They were all just too cool.  The best death scene is by far, by Mace Windu.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.Overall the movie is not too good yet not too bad.  Rating 6 out of 10.",10,0,1,22 June 2002
Forrest Gump," Possibly the best movie ever
","This has to be one of the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mentally challenged man who just happens to make history over his life.  He makes history like inspiring Elvis's dance, the smiley face and all sorts of stuff.  He is great playing Forrest and I enjoyed him all the way.  Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Mykelti Williamson were all really good as the other characters who help Forrest in his life. Robin Wright is also very good as Jenny, the one and only person that Forrest loves and also gets some history in her.  I enjoyed everyone's performance and Robert Zemeckis made himself a true gem here.  He's a great director alone but this made him one of the best.Overall Tom Hanks is wonderful and everybody else does really good too. Robert Zemeckis did great with this and he is possibly one of the greatest directors of all time.  This movie is possibly one of the greatest movie of all time.  Rating 10.5 out of 10.

10 Things I Hate About You," Good
","I enjoyed this movie a lot.  Heath Ledger, Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Julia Stiles, and Larisa Oleynik all give wonderful performances as the main teen characters and I was very convinced by their acting talents.  This movie has enough laughs to convince anyone and it actually had a connective double-love story.  Larry Miller does good as the overbearing father and I was convinced by him.Overall this movie was very well and Larisa Oleynik and Julia Stiles are SUPER hot.  Rating 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,20 May 2002
American Pie," Hilarious
","American Pie is an absolute hilarious film.  chris Klein, Jason Biggs, Eddie kaye Thomas, and Thomas Ian Nicholas all make a pact to lose their virginity before graduation.  This is a very creative plot.  I have to say that the best scene is Nadia's 'changing session' and more.  It made me very VERY happy.  All of the jokes are mainly sexually crude but very funny.   The only odd thing about this is why nobody in a sexual situation ever locks the door for a little privacy.  Tara Reid and Thomas Ian Nicholas never locked there door when they decided to cramp his tongue.  Shannon Elizabeth didn't lock her door when getting dressed.  Eddie Kaye Thomas and a mystery character didn't lock their door.Overall I loved this movie and I was surprised at the outcome of this. Rating 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,20 May 2002
The Bourne Identity," As great as the book
","I was recently asked to attend a screening of The Bourne Identity and I said 'Sure, why not.' I mean, I've read the book a lot and I enjoyed the heck out of it and the other ones. So when I came out of the screening, I was REAL happy I saw it. My review starts here:The Bourne Identity follows the story by Robert Ludlum and the plot follows: Meet Jason Bourne. He has amnesia and the only thing he can remember is waking up on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. A few evidences of what has happened to him that he does not remember, like a bank account of millions of dollars. But the things that he doesn't know, is the things that may lead him without a future. The rest of the movie is an action-packed movie with great acting and great directing.Matt Damon gives a very credible performance as Jason Bourne and I enjoyed him all the way throughout the movie. Franka Potenta does good as what she has to do but her accent seems to change a lot. Chris Cooper is really cool in this one and I liked him a lot here. Co-starring in this are a few big named stars like Julia Stiles and Brian Cox. Doug Liman directed himself a true gem of a movie here.  He definitely proved that he is a great director. The movie was not filmed in a trilogy but the books are in one. I really can't wait for the sequels to come.Overall the movie is excellent on many levels and this could very well be ablockbuster of the summer. I recommend this to those who have read the book and just everyone. Rating BIG 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,5 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Very good
","I absolutely love this movie!  This movie has really awesome action and very great special effects.  The acting was way too good.  Ian McKellan should have won for best supporting actor, not that Tom Wilkinson was bad but I really enjoyed his performance.  I haven't yet read the book but I hear it's as good as the movie.Overall I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.  This is probably the only long movie that I can see again and again.  rating 10 out of 10.",10,1,1,21 May 2002
Grease," Cool musical
",This has to be probably one of the only musicals that I enjoy a lot.  John Travolta made himself worthy of being called a great actor in this and Olivia Newton John proved the same that she is a great actress.  They can both sing wonderfully and so can the others.  The songs are very creative and the writers of this movie must be geniuses.  The whole cast is really cool.  Stockard Channing did good as the leader of the 'Pink Ladies' and all of the other woman in the 'ladies' were cool.  All of the other guys in the 'T-Birds' were all cool and I enjoyed them.Overall the songs are great and the actors and actresses sure do know how to sing them.  Rating 10 out of 10.,10,3,5,24 May 2002
Cast Away," Survivor, Tom Hanks style
","This movie is very good but the trailer gave away too much.  It showed how he crashed and how he got off.  I found it spoiling for me but it didn't stop me from going to see it, again and again.  I bought this immediately on DVD, mainly for Tom Hanks performance.  He did a very awesome oscar-nominated job playing a plane crash survivor, who learns how to survive on an island for however long he needed to stay.  He even made a new friend on the island, a volleyball named Wilson.  The movie itself is very good and I was rooting for Tom the whole way.Overall the performances were excellent, the plot was great and I enjoyed every second of the movie.  Rating 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,22 May 2002
The Thing," Excellent Thriller
","This movie was great and I liked this a lot.  This was very interesting and it had me guessing who's the thing going to take over next? Who is the thing? Who did that to the blood?  When I was watching this I was at the edge of my seat.  You will like this.Overall the acting was good on everyones part including Keith David, Kurt Russell, and T.K. Carter.  Rating 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,12 May 2002
American Beauty," Strangely great
","* A possible spoiler *This movie, I have to say, is as strange as ever.  I mean it is still good but the opening line by Kevin Spacey saying that his job in the shower is the greatest part of his day.  And how when Annette Benning showed the first people the new house she had like emotional distress times a million.  Thora Birch wants her father dead and Wes Bentley agrees to do the job.  Kevin Spacey watches mena Suvari open her clothes and let flowers come out in his dream.  Don't get me wrong this movie is very cool, but weird at times.Overall the acting was very cool and I enjoyed Kevin Spacey's freaky performance.  Rating 7 out of 10.",4,0,0,20 May 2002
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," excellent action with 20 too many goofs
","This movie is a masterpiece and an unbeliebeable sequel to the 1984 blockbuster hit The Terminator.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the T-800 but now, he's on the good side.  Linda Hamilton is back as Sarah Connor and is joined by her 10 year old son John Connor (Edward Furlong).  Now, in the future, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) is sent to kill John Connor.  The action sequences are excellent and made perfectly.  I've got one BIG problem with this.  The bloopers.  Just look on the goofs section on this and you'll see it.  I know James Cameron can direct but he has got to keep his eyes open.Overall the movie is really good with excellent action sequences.  Rating SMALL 10 out of 10.",9,1,1,1 June 2002
Heartbreak Ridge," Excellent Eastwood movie
","When I first started to watch Heartbreak Ridge, I expected another Clint Eastwood kicking but in some war movie.  I was right, but I was wrong expecting this to be bad.  Clint Eastwood is great as Tom Highway, a gunnery who must train troops and prepare for Grenada.  He gives an excellent performance and he shows who his character really is and how good it is. Mario Van Peebles does really good as Stitch Jones.  He shows his character well and I enjoyed it.  The war part, which came mainly at the end, was cool enough.  The directing was really good and all of the other actors were good.Overall this movie is very cool and I recommend it to any Clint Eastwood fans.  Rating 10 out of 10.",10,15,23,25 May 2002
Apocalypse Now," Excellent war movie
",This movie depicts the horror of the Vietnam War very excellent.  It shows how to 'take extreme prejudice' in the war.  The performances of the soldiers were excellent.  Marlon Brando does very well and it is good to remember him besides The Godfather.  Martin Sheen was very cool in this and I liked his performance most of all.  He looks just like his son Charlie in this.  This one beats Platoon and The Thin Red Line.Overall the performances were very good and I was extremely surprised at how they depicted the horrors of the Vietnam War.  Very accurate.  Rating 10 out of 10.,10,0,0,21 May 2002
The Patriot," Great depiction of the Revolutionary War
",This is once again a great action/war movie by Mel Gibson.  He gives a very good performance as 'the ghost' and he got pretty mad at that revolutionary redcoat with his little hatchet.  That was pretty sick.  Heath Ledger gives a very credible performance as mel Gibson's son and I enjoyed his character. The bad guy (whom I don't know the name of) is very cool and he has to be one of the most interesting villains of all time.Overall the action sequences were especially good and very violent but I didn't mind.  This really depicted the revolutionary war good.  Rating 10 out of 10.,10,11,18,30 May 2002
Face_Off," Cool movie
","This is an interesting movie at many points, especially when I couldn't tell who was who at points.  If Nicholas Cage was John Travolta or if John Travolta was Nicholas Cage.  The movie is still good and the action was very cool.  John Woo did very good in this and Nicholas Cage and John Travolta's performances were great.Overall the movie is great with minor flaws and I recommend it to action fans.  Rating 8 out of 10.",10,0,0,23 May 2002
Spider-Man," Excellent
","I have seen this movie about 8 times now and I still think that it's good. Tobey Maguire is awesome as Peter Parker, a geek who gets super powers after being bitten by a genetically altered spider.  Kirsten Dunst does good as Mary Jane and I enjoyed the kiss between her and Spiderman.  Willem Dafoe is an excellent example of a great villain.  He was awesome.  The only problem I had with this is that it looked so fake.  the computer animated was too strong, which isn't a good thing in my mind.Overall the movie is very cool and very interesting.  Rating 10 out of 10.",2,1,2,1 June 2002
American History X," Norton is outstanding
","American History X is a very strange and awesome movie.  Edward Norton is awesome as the skinhead and since he was nominated for the Academy Award, I think he should have won.  I've seen him in a bunch of other movies but this one by far is the best and coolest one.  This movie is also pretty brutal. Examples: Shower scene and (possible minor spoiler) 'Mouth on the curb!'  I mean when you see how brutal this is you will hate Edward Norton in this movie.  Edward Furlong, Elliot Gould, and Fairuza balk were all very cool, too.Overall this movie is very interesting and cool and the perfomances were powerful.  Rating 10 out of 10",10,0,0,20 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Brilliant movie
","Ocean's Eleven is easily the best movie of 2001, if not one of the best movies of all time.  George Clooney is Danny Ocean, a man who just got out of prison planning to heist 3 casinos in Las Vegas.  He gets some people to join him.  The real thing is the revenge that he wants on the owner of the casino, who just happens to be marrying Danny's ex-wife.  The entire movie is excellent.  The direction is awesome.  The actors and actresses in this couldn't get any better.  Really, all of the actors and actresses are perfect for their role and their all excellent.Overall the movie is brilliant and definitely the best movie of 2002. Rating 10.5 out of 10.

Pearl Harbor," A good movie ruined by the love part
","This could've been a really good movie.  This could've been an excellent movie.  But this movie tried to make it a movie for older people and for chick-flick teens.  That was they're big problem.  the love part hurt this movie.  The action scenes are excellent though.  The ships capsizing and the bombing was a great depiction.  the acting was good but the actors put love into it. The only ones that were good were the rest of the soldiers.  They also had about 7 anachronisms.  Like a marlboro cigarette pack.
Overall the movie had a lot of potential and could've been better.  Rating 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,2 June 2002
Remember the Titans," excellent true story
",I do not see how anybody can't like this movie.  Denzel Washington and Will Patton give excellent performances as the two coaches at TC Williams high school who try to make fighting races get along and be on the same team. Almost all of the young performances by the teen football players are excellent and I hope that these people's lives go big later in life.  This has to be the best movie of 2000.  Definitely. Overall the whole movie is excellent with not a flaw in sight.  I recommend this movie to everyone.  Rating 10 out of 10.,10,0,1,31 May 2002
Saving Private Ryan," An excellent depiction of WWII
",This movie is a wonderful depiction of the 2nd world war.  It shows the true horrors of it.  It shows how sad war could really be.  It also shows the gruesomeness of it.  Tom hanks and matt Damon shine in this great war movie. They should've won awards.  It follows a group of soldiers who have to find a young man whose three brothers just died.  The whole group of men are tough as nails and really cool.  The battles are pretty intense and very gory.Overall the whole movie is really excellent and brought out perfectly. Rating 10 out of 10.,10,0,0,1 June 2002
Ghostbusters," Ghostbusters!
","Ghostbusters was probably one the coolest comedy movies of the 80s and it has too cool of a cast and a pretty cool plot.  Dan Akroyd, Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson are the ghostbusters who fight ghosts whoever, whenever.  The plot is Sigourney Weaver sees a ghost named Zool. Now she has to call the ghostbusters to get rid of zool and the 'gatekeeper' and 'keymaster'.  Rick Moranis is in this and hes cool and I love his character.Overall the movie has great laughs and the characters are all loveable. rating 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,23 May 2002
Men in Black II," Excellent! Better than the first!
","I'm sure Barry Sonnenfield was thinking, 'Why not make a sequel (to Men in Black)?  It made over 200 million bucks and there's no reason to not make more money, right?'  He's right.  There is no point in not making a sequel to a great movie.  Just better make sure that you don't make a horrible sequel to a great movie (like Grease's pathetic sequel).  Trust me, he didn't.  Oh, he definitely didn't. Here's my review:The movie is excellent.  Perfect.  It's no Coming to America or Training Day but it is definitely awesome.  The movie is basically what you see in the trailer.  Agent J (Will Smith) is doing his work as a top secret agent and making sure no one learns about aliens.  K, on the other hand, is a postal worker.  Yep, a postal worker.  There just happens to be an evil alien (Lara Flynn Boyle) who needs something before the world will be seriously screwed. One problem.  K knows where that is.  It is J's job to locate K, deneuralize him, and rid the world of the scum of the universe... again. They reprise the role of Z, played by Rip Torn.  They also have a few new characters, T and Rita.  It is a great movie.  Sure, the trailer gave away some good jokes but they have enough more to please us all.The acting...what do you think.  An Academy Award winner, an Academy award nominee, two VERY sexy ladies, and talking worms.  Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are excellent as always.  They brought a little more to there characters and worked there jokes perfectly.  Lara Flynn Boyle is one of the sexy ladies and was awesome as the villain.  I can't choose if she or Vincent D'Onforio was better.  The other sexy lady is Rosario Dawson who was very good here.  Patrick Warburton was there for a little while and his character was good.  The worms.  I liked them as much as I like hemorrhoids. Enough said.  I don't loath of them as much of Jar Jar Binks but I still didn't like their presence.  The found a few chuckles out of me but not enough.  The dog was pretty good here.  I think his name was Frank.Overall the movie is definitely awesome and VERY recommended.  Another summer blockbuster.  Rating VERY BIG 10 out of 10.",10,2,3,27 June 2002
Event Horizon," Good scary fun
","Event Horizon is about a rescue team who finds a missing ship that just might be in between the boundaries of reality and hell.  I enjoyed this movie.  A little freaky at times but most of all its good scary.  Laurence Fishburne did his character perfectly and I liked him.  Sam Neill's character was just plain freaky at times and at other times cool.  He did good as well.  The other characters are very cool as well, and most of their deaths were freaky.  The lady chasing that little kid.  I bet she didn't see that one coming, now did she?Overall the movie is good scary entertainment and I recommend it.  Rating 9.5 out of 10.",Null,1,2,9 June 2002
Dumb and Dumber," Laugh Out Loud Comedy
","This movie is probably the best comedy movie ever.  Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are hilarious and I enjoyed every second they were onsceen.  Jim Carrey is officially the funniest man of all time.  His character was very well written.  Jeff Daniel was hilarious as well and I have to admit I would never had expected him to be this good.  I have seen him do much more serious roles like in Speed and Arachnophobia.  He is great playing Harry. Him and Jeff Daniels are a great onscreen duo.  They rank up as one of the best along with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.Overall this movie was great from the beginning til the end.  Whoever is a fan of Jim carrey and Jeff Daniels or just likes comedy movies, I DEFINITELY suggest this. Rating 10 out of 10.",10,3,8,11 May 2002
The Evil Dead," Great movie
","Such a low budget, such a good movie.  This movie was filmed on a $150,000 but it was still a good movie.  All they had to do was make a book of the dead and a house and they've got a movie.  The acting was really cool. Especially from Bruce Campbell.  He was probably one of the coolest heroes I've seen.  The action was good.  Pretty scary and the tree thing with that girl was a little freaky.  I thought it was creative just weird.Overall the movie is probably one of the coolest horror movie I've ever seen.  Very good movie.  rating 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,22 May 2002
Jerry Maguire," Great acting in a good movie
","I have to say that I was watching a near drama until Kelly Preston and Tom Cruise were on-screen first.  'Don't ever stop f****** me!!' is the first line I heard her say and I was happy about the visual scenes.  The acting was great, especially from Cuba Gooding JR.  He is a great actor and definitely deserved the oscar.  Tom Cruise and Renee Zellwegger are awesome and are great as an on-screen couple.  The plot is good enough and the direction is cool.Overall the movie is really cool and the acting brought it up a point. Rating 9 out of 10.",9,2,5,26 May 2002
Black Hawk Down," Unbelieveable
","This war movie is unbelieveable.  I mean that in a good way.  This depicted the sad events in Somalia very well.  The acting was excellent and all of the characters are portrayed very well by the actors.  What you should do is watch the true story about it on The History Channel.  I saw it afterwards and I regret seeing it so late.  The movie itself is very violent.  If you cannot stand the sight of blood then I would suggest that you don't see it or at least close your eyes when you see a part come.  I was surprised at how graphic Somalia really was during that time.  I especially didn't enjoy the leg part.  It showed it well but I nearly threw up my popcorn.Overall this is probably the most realistic, graphic war movie I've seen yet but I still enjoy this movie and will immediately buy this on DVD.

There's Something About Mary," Hilarious!!!
","This is one of the best movies that the Farrelly Brothers made.  Probably the best of Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller.  Gross out gags make this movie hilarious.  I especially loved 'Is that hair gel?' and 'Frank and Beans!!' Those were hilarious.  the rest of the cast makes this movie shine golden. The plot follows a man who is in love with a high school sweetheart, who tries to find her while getting foiled by numerous hilarious plans.  Special condolences are to matt Dillon.  he did really good as the slimeball detective.Overall the movie is hilarious and every joke works perfectly.  Rating BIG 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,1 June 2002

","Roberto Begnini is excellent as a Jewish man who finds love, the must deal with the Nazi holocaust.  The first part of this movie is a good comedy. Roberto Begnini was very funny but I knew there was a twist.  The twist was a sad one when he, his son, and his wife have to go to a concentration camp during World War II.  This became a very sad thing to watch but it was still very cool.  It deserved all of the academy awards it won.  The acting was excellent.  Roberto Begnini was very cool and very humorous but it was sad overall.Overall this is a good comedy and tragedy and I loved it all the way. Rating 10 out of 10.",10,1,3,23 May 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," Stanley kubrick's best
",Stanley Kubrick sure did make a bizarre film here.  Tom and Nicole were great but the rest of this movie was weird.  What was up with the sailor?  I understood it but it was kind of stupid.  This film is very slowly moved and it took quite a long time to get to some stuff that needed to be brought to earlier.  The whole movie was good and sadly it was Kubrick's last.  The movie just confused me too.Overall the movie is too slow-paced but overall it was cool.  I would have given this an 8 but Nicole Kidman pushed it over.  Rating 10 out of 10.,10,1,2,23 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," excellent special effects
","This movie has to have one of the best special effects I have ever seen. The only problem is the movie isn't so great.  I don't like the book, so obviously I don't like the movie that much.  The acting was very good, and the direction was excellent.  the special effects are perfect.  Especially the quiditch game and the three headed dog.Overall the movie isn't that great but the special effects makes up for it. Rating 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,3 June 2002
The Untouchables," excellent portrayal of the true events of Al Capone and Eliot Ness
","This is definitely one of the most accurate depictions of a movie.  Ever. Robert DeNiro is excellent as playing one of the most notorious gangsters of all time, Al Capone.  kevin Costner does great as Eliot Ness.  Sean Connery does really good, in an oscar-winning role, as Jim Malone.  Them and a few other people tag up to take down Al Capone, once and for all.

","Russell Crowe gives a wonderful performance in this true story of the mathematician John Nash.  It really shows you how good Ron Howard can direct.  It shows you how good Russell Crowe is.  It shows you how good Jennifer Connelly really is.  It shows you how good Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg are.  Russell Crowe gives an absolutely brilliant performance and I don't know if either he or Denzel or Will or Sean, etc. should've won but this guy is great.Overall I loved this movie and I saw it again and again and loved it every time.

","Tom Hanks rocks.  Michael Clarke Duncan rocks.  Michael Jeter rocks.  All of the actors rock in this movie.  There is not a single flaw in the film I have seen and all of the actors make their characters look just like they're shown.  If all of the actors and actresses could win an award for this then I would be extremely happy.  Tom hanks role is perfect for him and he should have won an Academy Award for this.  Michael Clarke Duncan was awesome and made his character look really cool and sympethetic.  Stephen King's novel, which I have read, is perfectly brought out in this gem of a movie.Overall the entire movie is great and perfect.  I have never known that Stephen King can write such good movies without horror in it.  He also wrote the gem The Shawshank Redemption.  Rating 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,24 May 2002
Jaws," How did this get PG?
",Excellent movie.  Violent movie.  Great acting movie.  Not a PG movie. Shouldn't be a PG movie.  How could this be a PG movie?  i could only imagine a 7 year old seeing a guy's bloody leg fall to the bottom of the ocean.  The movie is still very good with some minor points.  The acting is excellent and they should've been nominated.  I don't care who but somebody. This is pretty violent but it is still very good.  That is the only point. The MPAA was probably smoking dope when they heard of this.  Seriously that's what I'm guessing.Overall the movie is awesome.  Excellent acting and excellent plot.  It set off some good and bad sequels.  Rating 9.5 out of 10.,9,0,1,26 May 2002

He also made The Green Mile.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are excellent in this excellent movie.  they both should've won Academy Awards for this one.  Definitely.  I love this movie.  I must have saw this movie about 20 times.  It is as great as the critics say it is. The direction for this is amazing.Overall the whole movie is great and I am surprised that Stephen King made such a good novel.  I've made my mind for the best movie of the '90s. Rating 11 out of 10.

Halloween," Excellent horror movie
","John carpenter and Debra Hill didn't know what they had started when they made this film.  They really didn't.  The people who followed them were pretty good and pretty bad.  With the exception of 2, 7, and 8, the other movies are bad.  this movie is really cool, though.  It started off Jamie Lee Curtis's high point of her career.  The acting was great.  Donald Pleasence was really good as the doctor who is now hunting Michael.  When Michael was about 6 years old, he murdered his sister.  he was put into a psychiatric ward for about 15 years, until he escaped and came home.  Came home to finish his sister off.  It is up to Sam Loomis to stop Michael's terror forever.  I've got one question though.  How could Michael take 6 shots to the chest and still be alive?  We presume he is human but maybe he is wearing a sheet of metal under his suit.Overall this movie is stylishly scary and set off some good and bad sequels. Rating 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,25 May 2002

Marty and Doc are back and they actually go to the future, in the year 2015. Biff and his gang are back, too.  This is a great sequel to a great movie and Robert Zemeckis was very smart to make this.  Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are back as their characters and I enjoyed them.Overall the movie is an intelligent sequel and sets off another great sequel.  Rating 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,3 June 2002
Carrie," Pretty good
","This movie isn't that bad but more of overrated.  The novel is good and the movie is pretty good its just you're watching a good drama that turns into a violent rampage of death and burning.  You're watching a ridiculed girl Carrie, played by Sissy Spasek, who is overbeared by her religious fanatic mother, played by Piper Laurie.  The acting is very well and I thought that Sissy and Piper should've won.  They shined as much as everybody else in this.  Overall the movie is a little to overrated but it went to quickly from a drama to horror in 2 seconds.  Rating 7 out of 10.",8,0,0,22 May 2002
Speed," great edge of your seat
","This movie is a great example of an awesome edge-of-your-seat thriller. keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock do really good together and their chemistry is perfect.  The thing that makes this movie so good is that it's not predictable at all.  It makes you think, 'i didn't know that was going to happen.'  It made me.  Another thing that made me like this movie so much is Dennis Hopper's ending.  OUCH!Overall the movie is excellently made with great acting and great chemistry. rating 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,1 June 2002
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Great movie

They go back in time and collect different historical people so they can pass the grade.  genghis Khan was hilarious especially in the sports department.  Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter give very convincing performances and I enjoyed them both.  This is weird though because they didn't alter time when they took the people.Overall this movie is very funny and I loved it and bought it immediately on DVD.

It was good but just a little stupid.  the acting is very good and Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne are really cool.  Carrie Anne-Moss is really cool in this, too.Overall the entire movie was great and the special effects amazed me.  I can not wait for The Matrix sequels to come out.

","I laughed so hard during parts of this movie, I nearly cried.  Keanu Reeves gives a good performances as Shane Falco, a washed-up football quaterback who can now play as a replacement on a washed-up football team with other replacement players.  The rest of the football plaers are great and I loved each and everyone of their performances.  It's hard not to laugh at the parts of the movie.  This came out around the time of Remember the Titans, sadly I have to say that Remember the Titans was better.

Apollo 13," Amazing Tom Hanks movie
","I enjoyed this movie a whole lot but mostly by the characters.  The actors who play these characters hit the spot perfectly.  Tom hanks,  Gary Sinise, Kevin bacon, Bill Paxton, etc. all do a wonderful job.  The plot is simple enough.  3 astronauts are on a mission to the moon and while on their mission, experience some big troubles.  It takes them a lot of hardship to finish it.  I like it better because it's a true story and it tells the story with no flaws.Overall this movie is just awesome and I loved every part of it.  Possibly one of Ron Howard's best.

Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Excellent, Tom Cruise at his best
",i have to say that I did not see this movie until late last year.  I absolutely regret seeing this so late.  I personally didn't think that it would be that good.  I thought it would just be another blood-sucking movie with big name stars.  I was right and wrong.  I was right about the blood-sucking vampire part and the big name actors but I was wrong about it being bad.  It turned out to be one of the best horror movies of the '90s. Tom Cruise is probably at one of his best parts here.  he is perfect playing Lestat.  Brad Pitt is excellent in this to and I wouldn't have picked a better actor to play his part.  i was surprised at how good Kirsten Dunst is in this.  She definitely made a name for herself in this.  She was awesome.Overall the entire movie is excellent.  It's quite bloody but I didn't care. The acting is the best I've seen in awhile.  Rating 10 out of 10.,10,1,2,26 May 2002
Windtalkers," Why did they stick around Cage instead of the codetalkers?
","When I first walked into this movie, I had extremely high hopes.  There has been so many great war movies these past years.  Like Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, Thin Red Line, The Patriot, (average) We Were Soldiers, (I guess you could call it a war movie) Behind Enemy Lines, etc.  So what could hurt this film? Huh?  Well, a whole lot of things.  Knowing John Woo is a great director there shouldn't be many problems.  Just let me start. 1) Goofs: FACTUAL ERROR: Soldiers don't carry Hershey's because the chocolate would melt and screw the gun up.  ANACHRONISMS: 50 star flag was not made. It should be 48.  REVEALING MISTAKES: Obvious dummies in flipped jeep after Ben 'takes a smoke'.  Plus, many more. 2) Storyline does not stick to the Navajo codetalkers enough and distinctly revolve around Joe Enders (whose not real).  They use the Navajo as plot devices more of the actual reality uses for them. 3) Unrealistic events.  How in the hell can Japanese men not lay a scratch on Joe (Cage) and he can hit like a million of them.  *Spoilers * Spoilers * In the beginning, a grenade blows up a foot away from Joe's foot and all he has is a wobbly leg and a screwed up ear.  He should've been in pieces. Also, in the end, Joe gets shot twice by Japanese with AK-47s and he kills them all with a pistol.  In addition, he gets shot in both legs and one arm, and can still be able to pick up a wounded Ben Yahzee. * More Spoilers ahead * 4) How did some samurai come to Christian Slater and chop off his head without him seeing?  Or Whitehorse? * End Spoilers *Overall the movie should be better than it is and the 4 stuff above really messed up the movie.  Rating 6.5 (or **1/2) out of 10.",Null,0,1,20 June 2002
Gladiator," Greatest action movie ever

I especially like the fight with Russell Crowe and the guy with the cool mask and axe and sword.  If you don't know which one was that, that's the one with the tiger.  All of the other ones were really cool especially the slaves against the warriors.  That was cool and that arrow lady gets it good.  Really good.  The one with Joaquin Pheonix and Russell Crowe was very good.  The acting between everybody was good and Russell Crowe deserved that Academy Award.  I think Joaquin Phoenix should have gotten it, too.  He was really good as the villain.  Overall the entire movie was great and I recommend this to everybody.
