Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Satisifying.
","When 'Kill Bill Vol. I' finished last year; the anxious wait for the conclusion of Tarantino's revenge saga began.Would The Bride get her revenge?Would she be re-united with her daughter?How many more people would she dismember?Well, the sequel is here, and the result is good.Very Good.It's probably not as fun as Volume I (with its so-over-the-top-it's-almost-funny violence) but it's a lot more satisfying.Volume II focuses more on lengthy explanations and unravelling plot points, with the low impact (but still bloody) violence taking a back seat. In lesser hands, this film could have been boring and slow, but Tarantino uses concise, witty dialogue to get his point across, which allows the film to move at a good pace. He even has time to indulge himself in some comic book mythology.While you wouldn't expect a violent revenge film to be a bag of gags, Tarantino manages to wring big laughs from unlikely situations.The film starts with The Bride (Uma Thurman) recapping the audience on Volume I, including the events with led to The Bride being in a coma. The film rolls on to The Bride's confrontation with Budd (Michael Madsen), who buries her alive. Fortunately for The Bride, knowledge gained from her flashbacked training scenes with Martial Artist Pai Mei (who hams it up in a homage to the old 'Monkey' series) and gets her out of danger. After Budd meets his surprising fate, The Bride goes after the one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). In one of the films' more memorable scenes, The Bride and Elle battle in a cramped caravan before an eye-catching conclusion. Kill Bill then moves to its lengthy conclusion with Bill (David Carradine), where retribution and surprises await.As in the first film, Tarantino, a major movie geek, includes little nods to his, and the films', influences. There's also a great soundtrack, including a remix of the old hit 'About Her' by Malcolm Mclaren.Overall, this film is a unique experience, with lashings of humour, violence, intellectualism and even a bit of sentimentality.These factors alone will ensure Kill Bill Volume II will enjoy a healthy box-office run. But the real impact may not be seen until Tarantino's baby is released in its almost inevitable Volume I/Volume II DVD package, which is sure to be a hit among fan boys and movie buffs alike.",8,1,2,28 April 2004
Walk the Line," life story of Johnny Cash
","While I admit I've never been a huge fan of Johnny Cash or country music in general, I really enjoyed 'Walk the Line'. While, plot-wise, it bears similarities to Jamie Foxx's Oscar breakthrough, 'Ray', what elevates 'WTL' above the other music bios is the performance of the two leads. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, as Cash and June Carter respectively, do all their own singing, giving the movie a more authentic feel.The story starts out in Cash's hometown, and the pivotal tragedy which would govern Cash's every action onwards. That is the death of his older brother, who appeared headed for the priesthood. He feels incredible guilt, not helped by his emotionally distant father, Ray (Robert Patrick). While in the air force, he begins penning what would become 'Folsom Prison Blues', and, once back home, forms a gospel band with an eye to cutting a record, much to the disapproval of his wife, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) When the eventually get recording time, Johnny gets berated for singing the same old gospel stuff. So, in a last-ditch attempt, he sings 'Folsom Prison Blues', and secures a record deal. From there Cash goes on tour after tour (while Vivian is at home raising the kids) with Elvis (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne) and June Carter, who he relentlessly attempts to court. A fight between Cash and Carter inspires the titular track, while Carter, in a period of loneliness, composes 'Ring of Fire'. Cash also plays a big role in lifting Carter, whom he admired as a child, from comedy performer to a serious singer.Cash's dependence on prescription drugs, as a way to block out the ever-present demons, aren't glossed over, as his superstar lifestyle, regular touring, and inner demons, takes its toll. All this anger comes to a head at a spiteful Thanksgiving dinner. Encompassing all of this is June. In a heartening display of true love, when Johnny stoops to his lowest, she feels compelled to get him back on his feet.As previously mentioned, the performances from Phoenix and Carter are what sets this apart. The live performances are very enjoyable, and Phoenix has a controlled stage presence as his seems to channel Cash. The performance at Folsom Prison, which was cut as a live album, (and pitched by Johnny when he realised the majority of his fan mail was coming from prisons) bookends the film. It also includes my favourite song, 'Cocaine Blues'Overall, 'Walk the Line' is a tremendously enjoyable experience. Part love story, part musical, and part look at how traumatic experiences and inner demons can destroy even the most successful man.",9,0,0,7 February 2006
Gremlins," Classic Christmas Comedy-Horror
","Over 34 years old, 'Gremlins' is a deserved comedy-horror classic.We all know the story: Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) receives a cute little Mogwai (Gizmo) as a present. After accidentally feeding Gizmo after midnight, thousands of nasty Gremlins mutate and take over the town.Looking back, 'Gremlins' is more comedy than horror (though the ugly Gremlins may be scary for young kids); Gizmo is absolutely precious and the Gremlins' antics are more mischievous than terrifying, they just want to cause as much mayhem as possible while singing along to 'Snow White'. Even during the chaos, the Gremlins are still pretty cute.'Gremlins' is a lot of fun and a worthy Christmas classic.",10,1,2,28 December 2018
The Death of Stalin," Entertaining Political Satire
","Director and writer Armando Iannucci is famous for brilliant political satire shows 'VEEP' and 'The Thick of It'.It's no surprise that 'The Death of Stalin' is just as good as those two shows.After Stalin's unexpected death, the power play between the Council of Ministers begins. It gets very sweary, occasionally violent (a lot of people get shot in the head due to Stalin's lists) and is a lot of fun. The back-and-forth between the council could be its own long-form series, allowing the political intrigue and satire to really be explored. As Stalin isn't in this movie very long, he's treated as a revered, almost mythical figure, to be respected and feared.There's a great cast, including Jeffrey Tambor, Steve Buscemi, Michael Palin, and Jason Isaacs. The actors keep their native accents. It's a good move as it allows the dialogue to flow naturally rather than be distracted by dodgy Russian accents.If you love political satire, 'The Death of Stalin' is a must watch.",10,0,0,26 May 2019
Wayne's World," Still excellent after nearly twenty years
","While Mike Myers may be better known for Austin Powers and Shrek, 'Wayne's World' was the film that really brought his comedic genius to the mainstream public. Originally a Saturday Night Live sketch about Wayne (Myers) and Garth (the underrated Dana Carvey) about two friends who start a public access cable TV show in their basement, it's one of the best (if not the best) SNL-to-film adaptations ever.While the plot is fairly simple, where WW really shines is its clever humour. It highlights and subverts the rules of film narrative, something Myers carried over into Austin Powers, a trait which is lacking in the more predictable comedies of today (especially the awful 'parody' films). Wayne and Garth talk directly to camera (which only they are allowed to do), there's blatant product placement, pop culture parodies, guest appearances, the famous Bohemian Rhapsody headbanging scene and funny alternate endings. Top that off with the slew of silly jokes and endlessly quotable lines (including one of the first uses of the phrase 'that's what she said'), and you have a film which – even nearly twenty years later – still strikes a chord with viewers, regardless of their age. Even towards the end, when the need to wrap up the story cleanly can ruin many comedies, 'Wayne's World' still retains its sense of humour, a prime example being Wayne's 'Oscar winning' speech to win back Cassandra (Tia Carrere).If you feel like a laugh or want to relive some memories, then you could do far worse than check out 'Wayne's World'. Excellent.",10,9,14,1 July 2010
Superbad," Superbad - super good
","Following in the footsteps of 'The 40-Year-Old-Virgin' and 'Knocked Up', 'Superbad' is the third comedy to star Seth Rogen  who has a minor role as a cop - in the past couple of years. 'Superbad', which stars Jonah Hill and Michael Cera  who most people will recognise as George-Michael from the excellent 'Arrested Development'  is a coming-of-age film. While 'Virgin' dealt with a middle-aged man coming to grips with his sexuality, and 'Knocked Up' about the consequences of a one night stand, 'Superbad' is about two best friends in the final throes of high school. Seth (Hill, in the role originally intended for Rogen when the film was written by Rogen and Evan Goldberg) is a foul-mouthed, overweight teen obsessed with sex (and drawing dicks, as shown in a hilarious montage) while Evan (Cera) is a quietly-spoken, studios young man, who is set to go to Dartmouth College, while Seth isn't. With two weeks to go until school finishes, Seth and Evan are getting ready to go to one final party, with the help of their dweebish friend Fogell who gets a fake ID with the name McLovin, and later befriends two lazy cops (Rogen and SNL's Bill Hayley)  with the aim to score with the girls they have a crush on by getting them drunk, though Evan, who is in love with Rebecca, is less concerned about this. Seth, however, is worried about leaving school a virgin. The plot, however, is just an excuse for a lot of coarse language and gross-out humour. Yet, the crux of the story is the relationship between Seth and Evan. Unlike some movies of this genre, which fill the third act with overbearing sentimentality, Seth and Evan's friendship is treated realistically hence Seth's incredibly foul mouth. While they're two peas in a pod in terms of intelligence, they've been friends all their life, and this comes through in the film. It's this realism which gives the film substance under all the gross-out humour, and puts it miles about movies like 'American Pie' in terms of quality. The film is more about friendship then getting laid, which is refreshing. The only major beef I have with this movie is at two hours  it drags on a bit  but the satisfying, realistic finale makes it worth the wait.",9,3,7,26 September 2007
500 Days of Summer," Refreshingly realistic
","We all know the basic rom-com template: 'boy meets girl/boy loses girl/boy wins girl back in improbable finale to live happily ever after'. It's been done to death, with the small varieties of the same old formula trotted out every year. Fortunately '500 Days of Summer' is a giant breath of fresh air. Unlike the clichéd rom-com, it's not afraid to depict a realistic relationship: from the giddy early days, the painful breakup and everything in between, with the gorgeous Zooey Deschanel (Summer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Tom) as the leads.'500 Days' depicts Tom and Summer's relationship in a non-liner pattern, with numbered titles indicating the stage of their relationship. Tom is an optimistic believer in true love while Summer thinks relationships are a waste of time. This movie is in parts painful and hopeful. Tom falls madly in love with a woman who seems out his league (at least physically) and slowly cracks begin to appear in their relationship. A great example is comparable visits to a furniture store. In the early days of their relationship, Tom's jokes about all the appliances being broken make Summer laugh. Fast forward to later in the 500-day timeline and those exact same jokes are met with silence.Tom is the focal point of the movie, and it's easy to sympathise him. Not only does he look like a 'normal' person (as opposed to the usual six foot tall and ridiculously handsome rom-com male lead), but we can see his pain as he starts out believing he's no chance with Summer, to falling in love with her and slowly realising that she doesn't love him in the same way. This is something most 'average' men can relate to: falling for a woman who seems too good for them, only to painfully discover they don't feel the same way, regardless of how much they seem to care. While the film can be depressing at times (especially when Tom seems to be given a second chance with Summer only to discover she's engaged), it does end on a hopeful note for Tom. The pain he went through with Summer forces him to re-evaluate his life and pursue his true love of architecture, which also leads to a possible new love interest.There's a real chemistry between Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt and the relationship is believable. Deschanel plays to her 'manic pixie dream girl' strengths and, as always, comes off as charming and adorable. Gordon-Levitt portrays all the insecurities and foibles of the 'average' man while still coming off as likable.While the film is about a failed relationship, the underlining message seems to be about personal growth. While Tom and Summer were never meant to be, both characters grow because of the relationship and start improving their lives. It shows that, despite the short-term pain, a failed relationship isn't the end of the world, but an opportunity to learn and grow for the next one.",8,2,3,28 May 2012
Deadpool 2," It feels bigger...because it is.
","After the solemnity of 'Infinity Wars', the Deadpool sequel offers some much-needed levity.Like all good sequels, 'Deadpool 2' builds on the first film's success and raises the stakes, with Ryan Reynolds excelling again. You're almost convinced he's ACTUALLY Deadpool.This time, DP's joined by Cable (Josh Brolin), Domino (Zazie Beetz) and Russell (Kiwi Julian Dennison, who fortunately gets to keep his native accent) as well as a couple of famous cameos (you'll have to see it to find out who...), with Colossus (Stefan Kapicic), Vanessa (Morena Baccarin Weasel (TJ MIller) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) returning.Directed by David Leitch (credited as The Guy Who Killed the Dog in John Wick), DP 2 amps up the fight scenes and visual effects, which elevates it above the first flim, with plenty of violence and blood.Of course, it wouldn't be a Deadpool movie without numerous fourth-wall breaks, movie/comic/pop culture references (including a brilliant Michael Keaton-era Batman line) and swear words. There's so many references that you'll need to Google them to catch them all.Be sure to stay during the credits, with one excellent post-credits scene that allows Reynolds to gleefully poke brutal fun at himself.",10,5,11,18 May 2018
Yes Man," Carrey, Darby and Deschanel make 'Yes Man' a winner!
","It's fair to say Jim Carrey's star has waned over the past few years, hitting a low point with 'Mr. Popper's Penguin's'.While 'Yes Man' may look like a quasi-sequel to his big hit 'Liar Liar' (in LL, Carrey can only tell the truth, in YM, he can only say yes), its one of his best films in a while and we see glimpses of the classic rubber-faced Carrey. He is supported by an eclectic cast, including the stunning Zooey Deschanel, the delightful Kiwi stand-up Rhys Darby, Bradley Cooper, Danny Masterson (Hyde from 'That 70s Show') and Terence Stamp.The concept of 'Yes Man' is simple: Carrey plays Carl, a man rooted in a vicious cycle of negativity. Trapped in the same dead-end job, with only his enthusiastic co-worker Norm (Darby) for company, he says no to everything, even his best friends (Cooper and Masterson), instead choosing to stay home and watch DVDs while pining over his ex-wife Stephanie (Molly Sims). A chance encounter encourages Carl to attend a 'Yes' conference (with Stamp as the instructor), where he has to say 'yes' to everything. While reluctant at first, this extreme mantra sets off a positive chain of events, including meeting the beautiful free spirit musician/photographer Allison (Deschanel), getting a promotion at work, reuniting with his friends and bonding with Norm. Probably the best part is how all of Carl's seemingly inconsequential positive moves come back at the end of the movie, which helps tie everything together.While this is a vehicle for Carrey, with all his rubber-faced mugging on display, the brilliant Darby almost steals the show. Anyone who's seen 'Flight of the Concords' will know how fantastic Darby was as the band manager Murray, and he carries that form over into 'Yes Man' with the same routine of well-meaning and enthusiastic awkwardness. The other star is Deschanel, who continues to light up the screen as the 'manic pixie girl' love interest. As the popularity of 'New Girl' has proved, its impossible not to immediately fall in love with Deschanel when she appears on screen.While 'Yes Man' may not have the long-lasting appeal of 'Liar Liar' (when Carrey was at his peak), it's still a funny and enjoyable comedy, with glimpses of Carrey at his best, and well worth a look.",8,1,1,8 April 2012
Ready Player One," Nostalgic fun
","'Ready Player One' is probably the most derivative movie of 2018...and that's a good thing.Echoing director Steven Spielberg's 1980s peak, RPO piles on the nostalgia, with the sci-fi flim chock full of video game, movie, music (an exclusively 80s soundtrack) and general pop culture references, from Atari and John Hughes to Halo and modern-day MMORPGs.The story is relatively simple: in the 2040s, America is a wasteland, with its citizens spending most of their time escaping to the virtual reality world OASIS. There's an amusing difference between the action of OASIS and watching players - in the real world - pretending to fight while wearing virtual reality headsets. The avatar of creator James Halliday starts a competition - collect three keys to earn the OASIS Easter Egg, with the IOI (Innovative Online Industries) corporation the main villains.The genius of RPO is the relatively no-name cast (aside from Ben Mendelson, Simon Pegg and 'Deadpool's' T.J. Miller) meaning the action takes precedence without the distraction of a big name actor, Spielberg's name alone does enough to generate interest. The references range from fleeting to important (the old Atari games have a vital role in the film's final act) without reaching 'Family Guy' levels of self-indulgence. The highlight is a sequence based on 'The Shining' movie, with a replica of the film's Overlook Hotel.Fans of pop culture, Spielberg and fun actions films will love 'Ready Player One'.",9,0,3,1 April 2018
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Single-minded Sweeney goes Gothic
","Revenge is a powerful emotion, and is a popular narrative tool for movies and books (e.g. 'The Count of Monte Cristo', 'High Plains Drifter' and 'Taxi Driver' to name a few). 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street'  directed by Tim Burton and based on the 1979 Steven Sondheim horror/comedy musical  uses the theme of revenge as it tells the story of 18th Century London barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp). Sent away on a false crime by Judge Turpin (an understated Alan Rickman), who wanted his wife Johanna (Jayne Wisener), he comes back fifteen years later with his young assistant Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower). Once he gets back, he teams up with Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who makes the worst pies in London. Driven by for revenge, he adopts a new identity  Sweeney Todd  and sets up his barber business upstairs, with the help of Tobias Ragg (Edward Sanders), after taking out Italian rival Pirelli (a delightfully over-the-top Sacha Baron Cohen). In an enterprising piece of cross-promotion, Mrs. Lovett starts making her pies out of the remains out his Todd's victims, whose throats he slits with his razors, only stopping when he gets the Judge. Meanwhile, Anthony has fallen for Tood's daughter Johanna, and is determined to free her from Judge Turpin, who is holding her captive. The most striking thing about Todd is his obsessive need for revenge, which consumes him to the point where the only meaningful relationship he can have is with his razors (which he serenades in 'My Friends'). The only time he pays attention to Mrs. Lovett  who is in love with Todd and will do anything to have him - is when she agrees to help with his macabre plan. The most striking image of the movie is near the end, where Depp is almost covered in blood. While this movie is  as expected  very violent  the violence is over-the-top, similar to 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' and 'Sleepy Hollow', and will only affect the weakest stomachs.Considering the dark nature of the movie, it was a no-brainer that Tim Burton would direct. Burton re-imagines 18th Century London as a bleak, Gothic sewer, similar to 'Batman', 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Sleepy Hollow'. Burton's regular collaborator Depp is superb as Todd. While his versatility is now well-known (thanks to his career-defining role as Captain Jack in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy), it's his singing voice which is the biggest surprise. Singing in a cockney accent, Depp handles the complex Sondheim songs, and manages to convey the desperation of Todd. While Todd isn't technically a bad guy, his actions are so abhorrent, and his purpose so single-minded, that he's hard to like. As befitting a musical, the characters move effortlessly between dialogue and song, with the highlights including 'No Place Like London', 'My Friends', 'Pirelli's Miracle Elixer', 'Pretty Woman', 'Epiphany' and 'A Little Priest'. In short, 'Sweeney Todd' is a brilliant movie, managing the tricky balance between soaring musical and macabre violence, without making it too gory or too melodramatic. He is helped by a quality cast and some great songs which convey the desperation of the period.",10,0,1,3 February 2008
Suicide Squad," Suicide Blah
","After the disappointing 'Batman v Superman', it was hoped 'Suicide Squad' would make up for it.The opening moments are promising: the events of Suicide Squad are linked to the end of BvS and the 'bad guys doing bad things for a good cause' has promise.Unfortunately, that's where the promise ends.'Suicide Squad' doesn't learn from BvS's mistakes, overstuffing the film with too many villains and a weak antagonist.The highlights of the film are Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and Deadshot (Will Smith); had 'Suicide Squad' focused more on them, it would have been better. The problem with 'Suicide Squad' is cramming so many relatively obscure villains in one movie; the necessary backstories are rushed – just enough to give context.'Suicide Squad' would have been a lot better as a long-form Netflix series, with more time to establish characters and gradually set the stakes for a big finale.There are some decent cameos from Ben Affleck's Batman and Ezra Miller's The Flash but the humour (apparently inserted after the BvS backlash) feels forced at times.Hopefully 'Suicide Squad 2' can fix the mistakes of the first film.",5,0,0,1 July 2017
Rush," Engrossing entertainment
","By focusing on the rivalry between James Hunt ('Thor's' Chris Hemsworth) and Nicki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and avoiding the familiar sports movie formula, 'Rush' speeds past most 'underdog done good' sport films. Directed by Ron Howard, 'Rush' documents the battle for Formula One supremacy between Englishman Hunt and Austrian Lauda during the early- to-mid seventies. This relationship is what makes the movie tick and something to be enjoyed by all movie buffs, not just F1 fans.While they share a passion for car racing, a desire to win and have big egos, Hunt and Lauda's conflict arises from their differences: Hunt is a tall, good-looking, outwardly confident playboy while Lauda is shorter, looks like a rat and more intense. Both men are intensely flawed – Hunt battled alcohol issues and pre-race nerves, which drives him away from his first wife, model Susie Miller (Olivia Wilde). Lauda is serious, intense and disliked by other racers, mainly because he uses his family's wealth to buy his way into F1.Not surprisingly, Hemsworth and Bruhl dominate the film. Hemsworth plays on his sex-symbol image (with a number of sex scenes) and Bruhl gives an intense and determined performance. Quite a contrast from those who remember Bruhl from the light German comedy 'Goodbye Lenin'. Bruhl's performance is even better considering English is his second language and he speaks in a heavy – but still understandable - accent throughout the film. While this is a serious film, the Hunt/Lauda rivalry is complemented with some black humour and back-and-forth insults.The film focuses on the 1976 F1 season, with some dramatic race scenes. While I'm not an F1 fan, the race scenes are engrossing and you feel like you're in the race with the drivers. The most dramatic part occurs when Lauda recovers from a horrific crash which saw his face badly burnt. Be warned, the hospital scenes are a bit gruesome. Luckily, we're spared a clichéd 'rise to redemption' fairytale finish like every other sports film.Even if you don't like sports films, 'Rush' is well worth watching for the dynamic between Hemsworth and Bruhl.",9,2,3,18 October 2013
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Incredible thoughts, incredible minds
","'Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping' is wonderful musical mockumentary from the Lonely Island boys (Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer). Rather than string a few of their film clips with a tenuous plot, they've created an original movie, with original songs.Gleefully aping Justin Bieber's 'Never Say Never', Samberg plays pop-rapper Conner4Real, a former member of boy band The Style Boyz with childhood friends Owen (Taccone) and Lawrence (Schaffer). Conner4Real become a solo superstar and a tabloid darling, his excessive ego and bravado makes Oasis in the nineties look restrained. The film charts the release of Conner's second album Connquest, some questionable appliance-based marketing choices, his friendship-turned rivalry with rapper Hunter the Hungry (Chris Redd) and eventual fall from superstardom. As well as SNL alumni Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows, Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph, 'Popstar' has an impressive list of guest stars, most who've collaborated with Lonely Island, including:Akon, ASAP Rocky, Michael Bolton, Mariah Carey, Régine Chassagne, Simon Cowell, Danger Mouse, DJ Khaled, Jimmy Fallon, 50 Cent, Adam Levine, Nas, Pink, Questlove, The Roots, RZA, Seal, Martin Sheen, Snoop Dogg, Ringo Starr, T.I., Carrie Underwood, Usher and Pharrell Williams. The best cameo is from the always-game Justin Timberlake, playing Connor4Real's put upon tour chef.Samberg - of course - dominates this movie, with Taccone and Schaffer pulling double duty as directors and playing Conner's bandmates.'Popstar' deserves its MA rating, with a number of delightfully filthy songs, including 'Finest Girl', which uses Osama Bin Laden's death as a sexual metaphor. The soundtrack is a must buy/download for Lonely Island fans.As a mockumentary, 'Popstar' won't have the wide appeal - or legacy - of Spinal Tap, but it's still a heap of fun, especially if you love Lonely Island's music.",10,1,4,9 February 2018
Justice League," A Middle-of-the-Road League
","After DC finally had a winner in 'Wonder Woman', there were hopes 'Justice League' would continue the momentum.It's doesn't.While JL isn't as awful as 'Suicide Squad' and not as messy as 'Batman v Superman' (or messy enough to need a director's cut to fill the plot holes) it still feels rushed and ill-formed, a legacy of DC's impatience in building their Extended Universe.The plot is basic: Steppenwolf needs to unite three Mother Boxes (one in Atlantis, once in Themiscyria and one on Earth) so he can take over the world or something. It feels like it's been done a million times and doesn't create a lot of tension.The problem with 'Justice League' is cramming together six heroes (including Superman's eventual return) in a two-hour movie. Yes, Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman are established, but Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman are properly introduced in the DCEU through 'Justice League'. Their backstories are minimal before they're thrown in the action; though Aquaman gets a solo film later this year, it seems a bit late.The handover from Zack Snyder to Joss Whedon shows, with a lot more humour in 'Justice League.' The comic relief work lands on the Flash, who plays the 'I'm just a kid and I don't really have control of my powers yet, but this is so cool' shtick. The banter between Alfred and Batman/Bruce Wayne is again a standout, including a callback to 'Batman Returns.'Superman's returns feels rushed, brought back out of necessity and his CGI-ed non-moustache (a scheduling conflict meant Henry Cavill couldn't shave his moustache) is very distracting. It's not a patch on the Return of Superman graphic novel, with four Supermen emerging before the real Superman's triumphant return.It's a shame this originally planned two-parter didn't happen, as the first film could've been used to establish the characters and set the stakes for part two. Rumours that the sequel has been delayed isn't a good sign for the DCEU.For a film meant to be DCs answer to the 'Avengers', 'Justice League' is disappointing.",5,0,1,18 March 2018
Man of Steel," Fresh start for an icon
","Normally, reboots are Hollywood's way of trashing an old – but profitable franchise – and starting again. Batman was rebooted successfully (with two excellent sequels) as was Spider-Man last year, with the darker tone not quite fitting with the comics' mythology. Now its Superman's turn: interestingly, this is the only film not to have 'Superman' in the title – possibly a deliberate effort to distance 'The Man of Steel' from the previous films.The great news is it works. In a similar vein to 'Batman Begins', TMOS strips back the Superman mythology and starts from the beginning. In a pleasingly thorough fashion, it explains the last days of Krypton and the reasons why Kal-El was sent to Earth, how the growing boy dealt with his emerging powers while trying to keep it a secret (for fear of being outcast) to embracing his eventual Superman persona: the man he was destined to become. Thankfully, there's no dual identity nonsense as the film focuses on the transformation of Kal-El to Superman. One of the most pleasing aspects is the relationship between Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman (Henry Cavill). Unlike the abysmal 'Superman Returns' the Lois and Clark pairing occurs naturally as Lois – ever the hard-nosed journalist - plays a major part in discovering Kal-El.While TMOS is a long movie, it needs to be: there's a lot of switching back and forth to establish the emergence of Superman. A young Clark is guided by his loving adopted parents Johnathan and Martha (played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), who both influence Clark in their own ways: Johnathan wants Clark to keep his abilities for his own safety while Martha is more nurturing. Their aim is to build on the code instilled by Jor-El (Russell Crowe), which is to make Earth a better place.The action scenes – especially the final battle between Superman and General Zod which stretch from Earth to space – are marvellous, regardless if you see it in 2D or 3D. None of the action feels tacked on or as a deliberate 'Superman fighting/saving people' set piece. Not surprising director Zach Snyder knows how to do stylistic action (see '300', 'Watchmen' and 'Sucker Punch' as examples). On the subject of Zod, he's a far less ridiculous villain than Lex Luthor and his motives – while evil, selfish and twisted – make sense. Again this is a nod to the Christopher Nolan Batman series, which attempted to base Batman's colourful villains in reality and give them relateable motives; not surprising as Nolan is heavily involved in this reboot. While 'Steel' is a bit darker than previous Superman films (even the costume is in muter shades of blue and red with tinges of sliver), it still retains the optimism of the character, though there are no hackneyed 'truth, justice and the American way' messages, which belongs in the 1950s.By stripping away some of the more ridiculous elements of past movies, taking the time to tell the origin story from a different perspective, making it more realistic and including some wonderful action scenes, TMOS has become one of the best films of 2013. We're likely to see the makings of a born-again superhero franchise, possibly the closest one to rival Nolan's Batman in quality. Superman fans have a lot to look forward to.",9,3,7,10 July 2013
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A Fresh Spin on Spidey
","After a wonderful Tom Holland-led reboot in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (with 'Civil War', 'Homecoming' and 'Infinity War'), Spider-Man is bankable again.'Into the Spider-Verse' capitalises on that momentum with a fresh take on Spider-Man lore and taking advantage of the deep roster of Spider men and women.There are seven Spideys in this glorious animated film: current day Spider-Man (Chris Pine), Peter B. Parker's fatter, lazier Spider-Man ('New Girl's' Jake Johnson), Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), Spider-Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld), Noir Spider-Man (Nicholas Cage, redeeming his superhero cred after Ghost Rider), Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn) and cartoon parody Spider-Ham (John Mulaney). While it's a small selection of the massive Spider-Verse from the comics, it's enough for this film. All the Spideys are distinct: Peter B. Parker is a slobby, divorced has-been; Spider-Gwen gives a younger, female perspective; Peni Parker has the anime cutesiness and technology; Noir Spider-Man has the old-fashioned lingo and confusion over a Rubik's Cube; and Spider-Ham has 'Looney Tunes' cartoon silliness.Being a superhero film, there's the necessary origin story for Miles, but it's different enough to not be rehashing the same old boring tale. Miles' journey follows the familiar beats before a final confrontation with Kingpin (Liev Schreiber), which takes place in a multi-colour multi-world purgatory. It's incredibly ambitious and it works.There's a fine sense of humour, with lots of references to previous Spider-Man films (taking a gleeful shot at the embarrassing 'Spider-Man 3'), the comics (when Miles first develops his powers, his thoughts are illuminated in comic panels) and a wonderful cameo from Stan Lee. It's also nice to see Lily Tomlin's Aunt May as a badass who has her own Spider lair rather than a frail old woman who has no idea that Peter is Spider-Man.If you love Spider-Man, this is essential viewing.",10,3,5,4 March 2019
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Walk Hard = laugh hard
","Movie parodies can be a tough art to master. The best ones, like 'Flying High', 'Hot Shots', 'Naked Gun', 'Top Secret', 'Scary Movie' and 'Team America: World Police' cleverly poke fun at the pomposities of their chosen genre, and often turn out to be more memorable than the films that inspired them. The bad ones  like the reprehensible 'Date Movie'- simply re-create the movies they're trying to parody, with not real satirical insight. Fortunately, 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' lands firmly (no pun intended) into the former category. WH: TDCS is a parody of the good, but overly earnest and reverential music bio-pics 'Ray' and 'Walk the Line'. While the plot of 'Walk Hard' borrows heavily from 'Walk the Line' (though the promotional poster is a parody of the iconic Jim Morrison image), it manages to be more than just 'Johnny Cash with dick jokes'. The film had fantastic pedigree; it's co-written by Judd Apatow, the man behind such hilarious comedies as'Knocked Up' and 'Superbad'; it stars perennial sidekick John C. Reilly as Cox, Jenna Fischer (from the US version of 'The Office') and a slew of cameos, including Jonah Hill (as the ghost of Dewey's dead brother), Jack White as Elvis and Paul Rudd and Jack Black as Lennon and McCartney respectively. While 'Ray' and 'Walk the Line'  which had remarkably similar plots  both only featured significant periods of the lives of Ray Charles and Johnny Cash respectively, 'Walk Hard' traces Dewey Cox from a precocious 14-year-old, who leaves his Alabama home with his 12-year-old sweetheart (though Reilly and his on-screen girlfriend Kristin Wiig are at least twice that age) after accidentally chopping his brother in half with a machete(which leads to his father constantly complaining that the wrong son died), right through to his final performance at 71. What happens in between is what makes this movie so hilarious. After leaving Alabama he makes it big with the country song 'Walk Hard', is hired by a group of ridiculously stereotypical Jews, leaves his wife and their growing number of kids to tour the country, gets hooked on drugs (despite his black drummer warning him about the side effects, which makes Dewey want to do them more), starts an affair with Darlene (Fischer), throws tantrums (including a propensity for ripping out sinks and letting the water fly), has ridiculously large orgies, does LSD with the Beatles (which includes a nice 'Yellow Submarine'-inspired animated sequence), breaks up and reunites with Darlene, accidentally chops his father in half and reconnects with his fifty children and grandchildren before his final performance. Like all true artists, Cox manages to adapt to the times. While he starts out as a country singer, he has numerous career changes, including singing protest songs for midgets, nonsensical Dylan-esquire songs, a hippie phase  which culminates in a hilariously bigger-is-better studio recording (including Didgeridoo players, a massive choir and goats), before a rejuvenation inspired by rapper Little Nutsack, who samples Walk Hard in one of his songs. If you're familiar with 'Knocked Up', 'Superbad' and the various other frat pack movies, you'll know what to expect from 'Walk Hard'. While it doesn't have the underlying heart of Apatow's last two movies, it doesn't need it. 'Walk Hard' is a straight-out parody, and, for the most part, it's hilarious. The songs complement the parody, especially the duet by Dewey and Darlene, which is full of lingering sexual references, punctuated by tactical phrasing. Reilly  who sung in 'Chicago' (mostly remembered for his solo number 'Mr. Cellophane) handles the singing duties well. He isn't as good as Joaquin Phoenix  who sounded almost like Cash in 'Walk the Line', but he still does well. Unlike 'This is Spinal Tap', which was a savage satire of a fictional English Heavy Metal band, its band members and the ridiculousness of their lifestyles, 'Walk Hard' doesn't set out to make fun of Dewey Cox, only the absurdity of overly serious and pretentious bio-pics. 'Walk Hard' achieves this goal, and manages to make it the best music parody since Spinal Tap, and one of the best parodies since the golden days of 'Flying High' and 'Naked Gun'.",9,3,6,24 January 2008
Avengers: Endgame," A fitting conclusion (SPOILERS)
","Heavily-anticipated movies are often dangerous, as the hype often turns into a letdown.Fortunately, 'Endgame' justifies the hype.While it's long movie (at three hours, it's a marathon by normally plus-two hour superhero film standards), it needs it as there's a big story to tell.WARNING, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSAfter finishing off Thanos early on, the remaining Avengers (Iron Man, Captain America, War Machine, Thor, Black Widow, Hulk, Hawkeye) devise a plan to time travel, get the Infinity Stones back and bring back the fallen heroes. It's inspired by Scott Lang/Ant Man (an always amazing Paul Rudd), who was trapped in the Quantum Realm at the end of 'Ant Man and the Wasp.' The biggest change has been Thor; living a quiet life in New Asgard, he's a fat, hairier, heavy-drinking recluse playing Fortnite with Korg (so great to see Taika Waititi back).From there the Avengers split off to track the Infinity Stones (the past-and-future back-and-forth drags on a bit, but it's worth it) and defeat Thanos (Josh Brolin), who returns from the past after hearing the news.The impressive thing about 'Endgame' is the epic cast: almost everyone from the previous MCEU movies appears, even for just a cameo, while some characters (like Hawkeye) get more exposure than in Infinity War. It feels like a tribute to the last decade, with some great callbacks to previous movies.Like most MCEU movies, there's plenty of humour amongst the action, mostly coming from Paul Rudd.The end of 'Endgame' feels like an appropriate conclusion to the current phase. While there are some casualties, it feels more natural than the carnage of Infinity War. Fans should be satisfied.",9,1,4,27 April 2019
Batman Begins," The Dark Knight's Triumphant Return
","Over his near seventy-year existence, Batman has undergone numerous changes. In terms of his filmic career, most viewers are familiar with the 80s and 90s films. While they started out promisingly under Tim Burton's direction, they quickly turned silly with Joel Schumacher at the helm, resembling the campy Adam West TV serial rather then the darker version of The Batman.Fortunately, 'Batman Begins' manages to restore The Batman's gritty reputation. Director Christopher Nolan wipes the slate clean, rebuilding the legend from the ground up, and it works. The film focuses on Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) lost years, which he spent at a Tibetan prison, looking to study the criminal mind. Bruce is still guilty over his parents death, and is hell-bent on vengeance. It's here he meets Ducard (Liam Neeson), who coaxes Bruce to join to League of Shadows, led by Ra's Al Ghul. The League are seeking to destroy Gotham City, which they believe has slumped beyond repair, and want Bruce to join. He refuses, narrowly avoids being killed by the League, and goes back to Gotham, where he reunites with loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), before forging the persona he creates to save Gotham, The Batman, with the help of Wayne Manor's answer to Q, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Standing in his way is Arkham Asylum psychiatrist Johnathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), who, as the Scarecrow, uses fear toxins to strike at the heart of his enemies, as well as mob boss Carmine Falcone(Tom Wilkinson), who runs organised crime in Gotham.The fantastic thing about 'Batman Begins' is that it's incredibly thorough. Comic books aren't known for having iron-cast logic, but this movie takes the time to justify every aspect of Batman's origin; including his motivations, his reason for choosing the bat as a symbol, the functionality of his costume, and the choice of the Batmobile. In fact, it's so thorough that it takes an hour for Batman to appear in costume, when the action beings and is maintained towards the end.. The film is bolstered by a wonderful cast, including Bale, Freeman, Caine, Holmes, Wilkinson, and Gary Oldman (Commissioner Gordon). While 'Batman Begins' is pretty dark, there are some moments of levity, especially between Bruce and Alfred, and Bruce and Fox. Overall,'Batman Begins' is one of the best superhero movies around, mainly because it's so comprehensive, and stays true to the character's original ideals.",9,0,1,19 August 2006
Wreck-It Ralph," Enjoyable trip into the world of video games
","The villain's point of view has been a popular theme for animated movies recently, with 'Despicable Me' and 'Megamind' the most popular. 'Wreck-it Ralph' is the latest film to focus on this theme, taking a similar approach to 'Toy Story' by centering on the sentient lives of video game arcade characters.Wreck-it Ralph (John C. Reilly) is the bad guy from 'Fix it Felix Jr', a thirty-year-old arcade game similar to the old Donkey Kong and Mario arcade game. Ralph is sick of being a villain and enters the game 'Hero's Duty' in an attempt to win a medal and gain some respect. An encounter with Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) from kid-friendly cart game 'Sugar Rush' (a little girls' version of Mario Kart) helps him find respect and redemption.While it's produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, this isn't the saccharine Disney films of the past. 'Wreck it Ralph' does a brilliant job of setting up a plausible world where the arcade characters come to life once the doors are closed, with a massive Subway system linking all the game worlds together, and a set of rules to keep the characters out of trouble. In a nice touch, the animation mimics the mannerisms of the old arcade games, complemented by the 'Nintendo-core' sound effects. While the film plays it fairly safe, its heart-warming without turning off the adults. There's also cameo appearances from famous video game characters: Sonic and Dr. Robotnik, Ken, Ryu, Bison and Zangrief, Bowser, Pac Man and his ghosts (the villains' 'Bad-Anon' meeting is held inside the Pacman game) and Q-Bert, as well as references to other video games. This will hold plenty of appeal to nostalgic adults who played these games as kids and ensure the film will have a wide appeal. The voice cast is quite impressive: John C Reilly and Sarah Silverman do a great job as the leads, with Silverman staying cute and wacky without being annoying, Jane Lynch as Calhoun, a tough soldier from 'Hero's Duty' with 'the saddest backstory every created' and Jack McBrayer as the noble, optimistic Felix.'Wreck-it Ralph' is arguably one of the better animated films in the past couple of years and enjoyable for kids, adults and big kids alike.",9,5,6,22 December 2012
Avengers: Infinity War," So it's Come to This...
","Ever since Thanos was teased at the end of the first 'Avengers', fans have been waiting for this epic conclusion (part one of two). 'Infinity War' lives up to the six-year build up.It's quite an amazing feat, with every Marvel Cinematic Universe hero appearing in this film (or in Hawkeye and Ant-Man's case, briefly referenced). What follows is an epic global and space battle as Thanos fights to collect the six infinity stones.Marvel's patience in establishing all these characters over the past 10 years pays off, as 'Infinity Wars' gets to the action straight away, and rarely lets up. Fans will love the blending of heroes from the various franchises (seeing Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy together was a personal highlight and is probably the funniest part of the movie). It definitely makes up for the disappointing 'Age of Ultron'.Without giving away crucial spoilers, Thanos' path for the infinity stones dramatically changes the MCU setup, leaving fans speculating as to where the MCU will go next. Luckily, there's another Avengers movie in 2019 (and an Ant-Man sequel in July 2018).Watch this space...",8,2,4,7 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's Hollywood rewrite
","Not many directors could get away with rewriting one of Hollywood's most iconic murders.Unless they're Quentin Tarantino.In 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood', Tarantino combines the Charlie Manson murders with a fictional story about a legendary Western actor and his stuntman/best friend in late-sixties Hollywood.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Rick Dalton, famous for Western movies and the (fictitious) TV show 'Bounty Hunter' (which Tarantino wrote complete episodes of during the film's preparation). His best friend is his long-time stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Rick can see his career ending as he's being typecast as 'heavies' rather than the hero. In one of the film's best scenes, Rick blows up in his trailer after fluffing his lines while shooting the pilot for 'Lancer' (a real Western), but gathers himself to deliver an outstanding performance. He's also next door neighbours to Sharon Tate and Roman Polanksi. The delightful Margot Robbie portrays Tate as a sunny, happy, upcoming actress.DiCaprio must be feted for the realistic and sensitive portrayal of Dalton's minor stutter. The stutter comes out in subtle facial tics when he blocks on a word or struggles to start a sentence. It's almost as good as Colin Firth's legendary performance in 'The King's Speech'.Meanwhile, Booth (killing time while waiting to pick up Dalton from the set of 'Lancer') picks up a teenage hitchhiker and ends up in the Manson Family colony at Spahn Ranch (former home of 'Bounty Law'), which is full of hippies hanging out or inside watching TV.This visit leads to the finale, when a handful of the Manson Family go to Dalton and Tate's Hollywood community with the intention of killing some celebrities. Rather than killing Tate (who's enjoyed a nice night out), they mistakenly break into to Dalton's house, where Booth (who's staying there after a big night out) and his adorable pit bull Brandy kill two of the intruders, with Dalton finishing off the last one with a flamethrower (no surprise seeing how much Tarantino loves grand, violent set pieces). The movie ends with Dalton introducing himself to a very much alive (and heavily pregnant) Tate, Polanski and their friends.While the rewriting of history may shock some (the Manson Family plot could have been fleshed out a bit more, but Tarantino obviously trusts his audience to fill in the gaps and do their research), if fits in with the film's fairytale 'what if' vibe (reflected by the title), and the successful melding of fact and fiction, with one flashback detailing Booth's on-set fight with Bruce Lee (Mike Moh).Like the best of Tarantino's films, 'Once Upon...' will only get better with age and subsequent rewatches, helped by the huge cast and sixties soundtrack.",10,18,25,17 May 2020
Django Unchained," Uncompromising Tarantino
","While the majority of Hollywood seem content to 'play it safe' through sequels, adaptations, remakes etc, Quentin Tarantino is one guy prepared to take risks, which usually pay off. Say what you want about Tarantino, but he knows how to craft a compelling movie, and 'Django Unchained' is a fine example.An homage to old-school Westerns and the slavery trade of 19th century America, Django (Jamie Foxx) is bought by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz, the breakout star of Tarantino's last film 'Inglourious Basterds') to train him into a deputy bounty hunter. Django and Schultz bond as Django reveals his desire to rescue his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the diabolical plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo Di Caprio).While the plot may sound like the usual 'heroes on a quest' storyline, the devil's in the details. The near three-hour movie is filled with loving homages to old Westerns, exposing the brutality of slavery (at times quite graphically), bloody over-the-top violence, plenty of coarse language (including frequent use of the N word) and the usual lengthy dialogue scenes Tarantino does so well, slowly building tension before a satisfying conclusion.One of the biggest strengths of the film is its cast: Waltz is brilliant as Schultz, who takes Django under his wing and doesn't judge him on the colour of his skin. DiCaprio, so accustomed to playing the baby-faced hero, is diabolical and at times downright scary as Candie. The big surprise is a nearly unrecognizable Samuel L. Jackson as Candie's corrupted butler/servant Stephen. Jackson is hilarious in a role which lets him swear liberally, something missing from his recent mainstream roles. No-one does motor-mouth angry black guy better than Jackson. There's also cameos by Australian John Jarrat (best known for 'Wolf Creek') and even Tarantino himself - with a laughably bad South African accent.Be warned, Django may be a bit confronting for some viewers, as Tarantino doesn't hold back on depicting the violence towards African- American slaves, which is contrasted by the spaghetti Western shoot-outs that are just plain fun to watch!Tarantino fans will flock to 'Django Unchained' and no doubt spend hours dissecting it. For the more casual viewer, it's well worth watch, though make sure you have a strong stomach.",9,2,6,27 January 2013
Garden State," An enjoyable journey down Garden State.
","As a major fan of 'Scrubs', I was mainly interested in 'Garden State' for Zach Braff. I was pleasantly surprised by this engaging comedy/drama. Braff (who also writes and directs) plays Andrew Largeman, an aspiring actor who goes back to his hometown of Jersey after his paraplegic mother dies. Andrew's life is a mess; he works as a waiter in a Vietnamese restaurant, and has been taking various forms of medication since he was a young boy, which have left him emotionally numb. Not surprisingly, Braff plays it much straighter as Andrew as he does with his 'Scrubs' character J.D. After the funeral, he catches up with all his friends at a party, and finds they've all settled in different ways: one's a grave-digger, while another one invented 'silent velcro', and is content to live off his riches. The next morning Andrew visits a local doctor for his lightningnheadaches. While in the waiting room, he meets Sam (Natalie Portman). A former ice skater, she turns out to be just as unbalanced as he is, (if a little more kookier) and they hit it off immediately.From there the movie follows Andrew's final few days in Jersey, as he bonds with Sam, with his 'best' friend Mark (Peter Sarsgard) tagging along, and tries to repair his tattered relationship with his psychiatrist father (Ian Holm). This movie is essentially a 'journey down the road of life' film, which takes a more relaxed pace by bending the traditional three-act story structure. Andrew and Sam are both flawed, but also have endearing personalities (Sam has bad luck keeping family pets alive), and by the end, you're left with a feeling that there's hope for them yet.Overall, this is an enjoyable movie about reconnecting with lives left behind in order to forge new ones.",9,0,1,18 August 2006
Clash of the Titans," solid action blockbuster
","Every major holiday period usually involves a big blockbuster movie, in an unashamed attempt to rake in as much money as possible. 'Avatar' was the big film over the Christmas period. Come Easter 2010, and it's 'Clash of the Titans' taking blockbuster billing. COTT (a remake of an 80s film of the same name)takes its inspiration from Greek mythology.While there's plenty of big action set-pieces and 3D elements (though they don't have much impact aside from a more aesthetic appeal), the story is fairly simple. The people of Argos have turned their backs on the gods, so Zeus (Liam Neeson) in concert with his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes), decides to give them some tough love, thereby forcing the mortals to embrace the gods again. Zeus' son, Perseus, is the only one capable of stopping the gods, though he is reluctant to use his demi-god abilities.'Titans' is an unashamedly blockbuster film; the back story is dealt with early, without getting too complicated, and the film probably won't be remembered for its acting (especially Worthington retaining his Australian accent amongst the British accents) and there's some corny dialogue and little attempt at humour. It's the action where 'Titans' flourishes. The battle scenes, especially the ones with Medusa, are suitably spectacular and make the two hour duration fly by, something the bloated 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' failed to achieve.While 'Clash of the Titans' is unlikely to receive as much acclaim as 'Avatar', it still manages to entertain with its big, bold action set pieces, even if the 3D element doesn't add anything more than an extra gimmick.",6,0,1,5 April 2010
The Hangover Part II," Deja vu all over again for the Wolfpack.
","'The Hangover' was one of the best comedies of 2009. While the plot had similarities to 'Dude Where's My Car,' it proved a far superior beast and the sequel was hotly anticipated. Director Todd Phillips has taken the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' mantra to the extreme, as 'The Hangover Part II' is virtually a shot-for-shot remake of the original. While it may be easy to write it off as cynically cashing in on the first film's success, the sequel is quite enjoyable with references to the first movie and a few 'here we go again' in-jokes.The plot this time concerns Stu (Ed Helms) who is getting married in Thailand to Lauren (Jamie Chung). After his plans for a quiet bachelor brunch are thwarted, 'The Wolfpack' of Phil (Bradley Cooper), Doug (Justin Bartha) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis – who only increases his whiny man-child characterisation) travel to Thailand for the wedding. After an awkward pre-wedding function, they lose Lauren's prodigal little brother Teddy (Mason Lee) – Bangkok has him now - and wake up in a dilapidated Bangkok hotel with a monkey and Mr. Chou (Ken Jeong) who steals every scene he's in and is the highlight of the movie.If you're after character development, you won't find it here, but that's not the point. 'Part II' is all about big laughs, some gross out humour (mainly Stu's unfortunate encounter with a Bangkok stripper) and plenty of action thrown in for good measure.While some may criticise 'Part II' for a lack of originality, or outright laziness, if you leave your cynicism at the door, 'Part II' is an enjoyable night out at the movies.",7,0,3,29 May 2011
Logan," The best X-Men movie ever
","After 17 years of trying, 'Logan' is arguably the best ever X-Men movie.It strips back the fantasy elements and focuses on three main characters: Logan (Hugh Jackman), Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Laura (Dafne Keen), a young mutant girl with claws like Logan. British actor Stephen Merchant plays the albino Caliban, a long way from his days on 'The Office' with Ricky Gervais.'Logan' owes a huge debt to 'Deadpool', which showed an R-rated comic book movie can be successful. While 'Logan' is light on laughs, there's plenty of swearing and lots and lots of blood. 'Logan' feels more like a road trip/adventure movie than a superhero movie, a refreshing change after the epic and elaborate comic book films 'Batman v Superman' and 'Suicide Squad' bombed. While this is the last time Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine/Logan (barring any surprise cameos in 'Deadpool'), Logan will probably be rebooted by another actor in the near future, so let's savour Jackman's perfect farewell.",9,3,9,3 July 2017
Friends with Benefits," Funny but not ground-breaking
","Just when you thought the rom-com genre had fallen into a predictable pattern, 'Friends with Benefits' comes along to try and subvert this pattern. While it fails to do that, it's still an enjoyable film which isn't as mind-numbingly formulaic as your average rom-com.Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis play Dylan and Jamie, two emotionally-damaged friends who start having no strings attached sex.While the film does tread a predictable path, there's enough laughs – especially from Woody Harrelson (as Dylan's gay workmate) and Patricia Clarkson (Jamie's free-spirited mother) – to keep it fresh. There are also some touching moments, such as Dylan's dad's (Richard Jenkins) battle with Alzheimer's. There's even a funny rom-com movie- within-a-movie starring Jason Segel and Rashida Jones, which ticks all the rom-com cliché boxes.My one biggest gripe of the film is their depiction of Dylan as a (recovered) stutterer. While explained away as a nervous childhood tic which was treated by a speech therapist, it comes back briefly during the helicopter rescue scene, then disappears. It seems to have been included to give Dylan some extra sympathy, but fails. His lack of basic math skills, by contrast, is much funnier.While FWB isn't able to put the fresh spin on rom-coms that it planned, it's still an enjoyable films which rises above the usual dross this genre serves up.",7,1,2,29 December 2011
Up," Brilliant!
","After last year's 'Wall-E', which was brilliant despite virtually being a silent film, Pixar have outdone themselves with 'UP' (which, like 'Wall-E' was released in time for the school holidays).The story is fairly simple. Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) is a old man mourning the loss of his wife, Ellie. After an accident sees him about to be shipped off to the dreaded retirement village, he ties a number of balloons to his chimney and uses his house to fly to Paradise Falls, a place Ellie dreamed of going. Coming along for the ride is young Asian-American boy Russell, an over-eager and slightly annoying Wilderness Society Scout desperate to get his last 'assisting the elderly' badge. From there the pair's journey is sidetracked by a rare bird named Kevin, an adorable dog named Dug (one of an army who can talk through a special collar) and Carl's childhood hero Charles Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer), who will stop at nothing to capture Kevin for his collection.As a story, 'UP' is fairly conventional; all the main characters overcome obstacles to reach their goals and experience events which change their life forever. Like most Pixar films, the real appeal is in the details and characterisation. The history of Carl and Ellie is outlined in a touching montage at the start of the movie which establishes Carl's motivations without hitting you over the head or cynically stringing out the emotional power. The characterisation of Russell is also well fleshed out; at first he seems like an annoying little nerd, but as the movie progresses, we see he's just a lonely little boy desperate for his father's approval, much like Carl is desperate to keep his memories of Ellie alive with his trip to Paradise Falls. For me, the standout character is Dug. Not only is he absolutely adorable, if a bit dim, but the talking doesn't detract from this. The dogs talk like you assume dogs would actually talk (they get excited at the sight of tennis balls or when they hear the word 'treat' and get distracted by a passing squirrel). Along with Kevin, the dogs provide the majority of laughs.There's also plenty of action, especially when Carl and Russell try to escape the clutches of Muntz. These action scenes, though, are probably a bit scary for really little kids.Overall, UP is a brilliant film. While it was released in time for the school holidays, it is more than just another silly kids film. The plot, while conventional, isn't boring and there's plenty of humour, action and some touching moments. More importantly, UP has appeal across all ages and has something for everyone.",10,2,5,29 September 2009
Thor," The God of Thunder leads the charge!
","With an 'Avengers' movie approaching, Thor is the latest Marvel hero to get the big screen treatment. While he lacks the profile of Spider-Man or Iron Man, 'Thor' – The God of Thunder - is easily the best superhero movie since 'The Dark Knight'. Thor has plenty of pedigree: it's directed by Kenneth Branagh (whose Shakesperean background suits Thor's Nordic mythology) and stars Sir Anthony Hopkins and Oscar-winner Natalie Portman. Aussie Chris Hemsworth is fantastic as The Mighty Thor; he certainly looks the part with his strapping frame and blond hair.Thor is the son of Odin, King of Asgard (Hopkins) and heir to the throne. An arrogant Thor incites war against the Frost Giants, is stripped of his powers and banished to Earth, allowing his brother Loki to become next in line to the throne. On Earth, Thor befriends scientists Jane Foster (Portman), Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) and Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). The scenes with a now mortal Thor adjust to his new environment that provides most of the humour. While the mythological elements are understandably kept to a minimum, there's still plenty of action, which – for once – is enhanced in 3D, though there are a few minor leaps in logic which don't affect the movie's enjoyment. The only complaint is there's not enough of The God of Thunder in action, but considering this is an origin movie, there is sure to be a lot more in sequel.",9,14,28,25 April 2011
Zombieland," Simply awesome!
","Are you sick of all the hype surrounding 'Twilight'? Are you hankering for a return to proper monster movies, where the monsters want to kill humans rather than fall in love with them? Well then, you'll love the awesome 'Zombieland'.It's hilarious (though people looking for a scare may be disappointed that it leans more towards comedy than horror), has plenty of gore and lots of cool zombie-slaying set pieces. Better yet, a sequel's been scheduled for 2011.The story is simple enough: modern-day America is a zombie-infested wasteland. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is seemingly the only 'normal' human left. Despite his scrawny appearance, he survives through a series of self-made rules, illustrated in a funny montage. On the way to see his parents, Columbus meets Tallahassee (a kick-arse Woody Harrelson, channelling his inner action hero), a redneck vigilante who's taken the zombie situation into his own hands with a big car, big guns and anything else he can get hold of. The combination of Columbus-Tallahassee harks back to the best buddy cop movies – Columbus is the uptight nerd, Tallahassee is both the main hero and the comic relief (he has the funniest lines in the film). They meet Wichita ('Superbad's' Emma Stone) and her 12-year-old sister Little Rock (an all grown-up Abigial Breslin). Like Columbus and Tallahassee, they've found a way to survive by sticking together. From here the film treads a conventional path: the foursome team up, Tallahassee's secret motivation is discovered and there's a romantic sub-plot between Columbus and Wichita.Don't be put off though, as this complements all the inventive zombie slaying, with plenty of blood splatter on the screen as the zombies are killed with an array of cool weapons (like garden shears). There's plenty of gore too: blood and goo oozes from the zombies' mouths as they feast on their victims out in the open, devouring the vital organs and drinking the juice from their bones. Throw in a brilliantly self-deprecating cameo from Bill Murray and you have a sure-fire recipe for awesomeness, a must see for anyone who love zombie, comedy-horror or action films in general.",10,0,2,28 December 2009
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," The D reign on the big screen
","For the best part of a decade, Tenacious D, comprising of Jack Black and Kyle Gass, have been rocking out fans worldwide with their unique blend of acoustic melodies, rock, comedy and metal. To most, they are best known for 'Tribute', their tribute to the greatest song in the world (which some believed was 'Stairway to Heaven'). Now, following a TV show, two albums, and a DVD, comes 'Tenacious D in: the Pick of Destiny'. Black (also known as JB or Jables) and Gass (KG, Kage, Rage, or Rage Kage) play themselves in this fictionalised account of the origin of 'the D'. As expected, the film includes a dozen songs which help narrate the movie, including: Kickapoo, Classico, Baby, History, Master Exploder, Papagenu (he's my sassafras), Dude (I totally miss you), Break in-city (storm the gates), Car Chase City, Beelzeboss (the final showdown), POD, The Metal.It also boasts plenty of guest starts, both singing (Meatloaf, Ronnie James Dio, Dave Grohl) and non-singing (Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins). The movie starts with a young Black, tied down by his conservative Christian father (Meatloaf), and dreaming of becoming a rock star. Through the advice of Dio, who comes to life in a poster during the performance of 'Kickapoo'. After running away to California (and growing up very quickly), Black meet Gass, who is busking at Venice Beach. Mesmirised by his guitar playing ability, Black tries to get in Gass' band, but is rebuffed. It's only when Black is later attacked by a group of 'A Clockwork Orange'-style thugs, that Gass offers his friendship, and a place to crash. From there, Black begins his training under Gass (including mastering the power slide and the cock push up), and with KG's rent payments from his parents due to be cut off, aim to win the open mic night at their local bar. When their performance of 'History' doesn't go down as well as they thought, they focus on writing a masterpiece. Struggling to find the perfect song, Black, flicking through Gass' old Rolling Stone magazines, discovers that all of the best guitar players use the same pick. As they try to find the pick in a music store, they discover the origin of the pick through the store's owner (Stiller). Known as the pick of destiny, it was originally one of Satan's teeth, before being carved into the green, ram-shaped pick, now held in the Rock 'n' Roll History Museum. From there, Jables and Kage aim to break into the museum, steal the pick, and become rock gods (as dreamt by Black, whose performance of 'Master Exploder', complete with all the cock-rock trimmings, is so powerful is causes one guy's head to explode). While Gass' predilection for ladies causes the band to split (Black: What's it going to be Kyle? Tits, or destiny? Gass: Tits.), they eventually reunite, steal the pick, but, just as they're about to get ready for open mic night, they confront Satan (Grohl) and engage in a rock-off. If the devil wins, KG will go back to hell and becomes Satan's bitch, and if the D win, Satan must pay their rent.Fans of the D will love the references to their first album (including the appearance of Lee, the band's only groupie, Gass telling Black to wake up at the crack of noon to start training {which was featured in 'Rock your Socks'}, cock push-ups, and referring to their rock-off with Satan as the greatest song in the world). For non-fans, the level of humour is similar to that of 'South Park', 'Borat' and 'American Pie', focusing on broad, scatological laughs. In fact, the film is bookended with fart gags by Gass.Overall, 'The Pick of Destiny' is, for those who are familiar with the D and their level of humour, an awesome movie, with some genuinely good songs, covering a variety of genres. For people new to the D, it's still worth a look.",9,0,0,14 February 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Spectacular, but too long
","Before the film's release, Michael Bay promised the Tranformers sequel would be bigger than the first, and he's delivered on that promise: 'Revenge of the Fallen' has more action, more Tranformers and lot (lot) more explosions. Unfortunately, it's also too long, at 2 1/2 hours. While there are are the usual cringeworthy 'comedy' scenes (like Sam's mother 'accidently' buying hash cookies and running around Sam's campus stoned) and some bad dialogue, the length is the main problem. Sure, a 2 1/2 duration worked for a complex film like 'The Dark Knight', but it doesn't work for ROTF. While the transforming, multiple explosions and robot battles are cool in the first half hour, they start to wear thin after two hours, especially as it can be hard to tell the Autobots and Decepticons apart during some battle scenes.The majority of the cast reprise their roles from the first movie, including Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. Aside from Optimus, the most sympathetic Transformer is Bumbleebee; while he can't talk, he expresses his emotion through body language and his stereo. The relationship between Sam (Shia LeBeof)and Bumblebee is sweet and funny, and more believable than the main human romance between Sam and Mikaela (Megan Fox).That's not to say ROTF is a bad movie. It's exactly what it claims to be: a big, spectacular action/popcorn blockbuster, with more emphasis on blowing things up than an intricate plot. It's the kind of movie you could lose yourself in for two hours, a pure fantasy experience, but a long one.",7,14,30,25 June 2009
Joker," The Dark, Depressing Descent into Madness
","Be warned, this movie isn't your typical comic book origin film. It's more like a long, brooding art house film than an exciting blockbuster.Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck/The Joker as a depressed, lonely, mentally ill wannabe-comedian who's sick of a corrupt society that ignores the downtrodden. He doesn't have the same comic mischievousness of Caesar Romero, Jack Nicholson and Mark Hamill, nor does he have Heath Ledger's anarchic criminal genius.If it wasn't for Phoenix's performance - or Arthur's tenuous links to the Wayne family - this would be another 'crazy loner snaps' story seen on thousands of true crime documentaries. Phoenix's Joker is far more serious and disturbed than previous versions, his signature laugh due to a medical condition rather than criminal glee.The slow pace (the action and bloodshed doesn't start until the final half-hour, when Arthur embraces his Joker persona) might turn people off, but Pheonix's immersion into Arthur/The Joker - supported by Robert De Niro as a veteran late night host - makes it worth watching.",6,2,6,7 January 2020
The Secret Life of Pets," Enjoyable comedy-adventure for kids and adults
","An enjoyable animated comedy-adventure with a big cast, 'The Secret Life of Pets' examines what animals really get up to when their owners go to work.
Louis C.K plays Max, a sweet little dog who loves his owner Katie ('The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt's' Ellie Kemper). Max's peaceful world changes when Katie adopts Duke ('Modern Family's' Eric Stonestreet), a giant, clumsy dog. Initially hostile towards Duke, the pair have to work together after getting lost in the park, attacked by alley cats and captured by Animal Control.While TSLOP avoids the adult-centric in jokes of most animated comedies, adults won't be bored, helped by a voice cast including Kevin Hart (a crazy, human-hating bunny called Snowball), Albert Brooks (the hawk Tiberius), Dana Carvey (the ancient dog Pops who hosts wild animal parties at his home), 'Parks and Recreation's' Jenny Slate (Max's wannabe girlfriend Gidget) and Hannibal Buress (Buddy, one of Max's dog friends).TSLOP isn't as memorable as the top shelf Disney/Pixar movies, but is still worth watching.",7,0,1,24 June 2018
Centurion," Sit back and enjoy the ride.
","Unlike the big-budget disappointment of 'Clash of the Titans', 'Centurion' is rather low-key, with no real big name stars or any 3D gimmicks. Fortunately, 'Centurion' is everything 'Clash of the Titans' should have been. There's an interesting quest story, atmospheric mise-en-scene and â€“ more importantly â€“ plenty of blood-and-guts action. This is not your Hollywood sword-and-sandals movie, polished within an inch of its life and designed to please everyone.The plot is fairly straightforward. Quintus Dias (the brilliant Michael Fassbender) is the lone survivor of a raid from the savage Picts, based in northern Britain. Dias marches with the ninth legion, led by General Virilus (Dominic West) to eliminate the Picts. When the legion is ambushed and Virilus is taken captive, it's up to Dias and a small band of soldiers to rescue Virilus, defeat the Picts and return to the Roman frontier.The spectacular violence is the highlight of the film. This is not for the squeamish, as blood flows from the opening battle and doesn't stop until the end: there's decapitated limbs, beheadings and lots of throat slitting. While there's plenty of violence, it never ventures into 'gore porn' territory. The fight scenes are edited so quickly that sometimes it's hard to pick up who's killing who in the mess of bodies. As a viewer, it's best to just sit back and watch the carnage, which certainly earns its MA rating (with a bit of swearing thrown in).Probably the most brutal is Pict warrior Etain (Olga Kurylenko), who has an almost animalistic ability to track enemies. While â€“ due to her character being mute - Kurylenko has no dialogue, she makes up for it by matching it blow-for-blow with the male characters. Like most films of this nature, there is a romantic sub-plot, between Dias and Arian(Imogen Poots), a Pict witch who has been doomed to a life of solitude and briefly houses Dias and his soldiers. Fortunately, the romantic sub-plot is only really hinted at and isn't there just for the sake of it.Though the mise-en-scene is quite murky, this adds to the film's atmosphere and helps to draw you into the story, as well as providing a stark contrast to all the blood. The score is quite unobtrusive - the only times you really notice it is in the quieter scenes, which helps establish the relationship between Dias and his soldiers, often punctuated with dark humour. If you like films with plenty of violence, then sit back, and enjoy the ride of 'Centurion'.",9,44,78,11 August 2010
Iron Man," Iron Man revives Superhero genre
","Ever since 'X-Men' was released in 2000, the superhero genre has been a constant on our screens. In the last few of years, the novelty looked to have finally faded, with films like 'Daredevil', 'Superman Returns', 'Ghost Rider', 'Spider-Man 3' and the 'Fantastic Four' films failing. However the genre has been given a boost thanks to 'Iron Man', the best superhero film since 'Batman Begins' and will rival its sequel 'The Dark Knight' (out in July) as the big blockbuster movie for 2008. The plot concerns Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) a prodigal weapons manufacturer (who inherited his company – Stark Industries - from his late father) who likes to drink and party, with secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) – and Jim Rhoades - his only allies. On a mission to Afghanistan (which is updated from the Vietnam setting in the comics), he is captured and forced by terrorists to build his new weapon, the Jericho. With some help from Yinsen – who builds a magnet which keeps the shrapnel in Tony's body from reaching his heart - Tony creates an 'Iron Man' suit and escapes. Upon reaching home, he announces that he's downgrading the weapons part of his business, which doesn't sit well with Obiah Stone (Jeff Bridges) who's only concerned about the bottom line, and lusts after Tony's job. Stone, desperate to have the company for his own, builds his own suit (from remains of Tony's original suit left behind in Afghanistan) to become the 'Iron Monger'. Seeing the destruction his weapons can cause if in the wrong hands, Tony vows to harness his 'Iron Man' suit to save mankind. 'Iron Man' works for a number of reasons: It manages to balance the necessary origin story with enough action and humour to keep the audience interested; Robert Downey Jr is fantastic as the troubled genius Tony Stark. He manages to portray the hard-living, slightly egotistical Tony with humour and avoided making him look like a complete jerk; It's very well-written. While it's a touch over two hours, not a moment is wasted. Like every good movie, nothing in 'Iron Man' is accidental. There's even time for an obligatory cameo from Stan Lee, and a nod to Rhodes' appearance as Iron Man's partner. Overall, 'Iron Man' is brilliant. Downey Jr is superb is his role and is one of the most charismatic heroes since Christopher Reeve. With numerous sequels all but guaranteed, filmgoers will be seeing a lot more of 'Iron Man' in years to come.",9,1,3,3 May 2008
Monsters University," Prequel fun for whole family
","With Hollywood constantly mining old successful franchises for new ideas, it's no great surprise that Pixar should go back to Sulley and Mike from 'Monsters Inc.' The prequel, 'Monsters University' takes place at college, where Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) is a hard-working idealist desperate to become a professional scarer despite his small stature. By contrast, Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) is cruising by on his family name and relies on his natural scaring ability. After being kicked out of MU's elite scaring school Mike and Sully join a fraternity full of forgotten monsters – Oozma Kappa - to compete in the 'Scare Games'. From there the film hits all the right buttons as Mike and Sulley, who initially hate each other, work together to make their fraternity competitive against the strong fraternities, while trying to impress the scary Dean Hardscrabble (voiced by Helen Mirren) to get back into scaring school. Along the way there are well-intentioned messages of believing in yourself regardless of size or ability. The unusual monsters from Oozma Kappa (including a retrenched salesman, a two-headed monster constantly in battle with himself and a squishy mamma's boy) provide some easy laughs.'Monsters University' may not try anything new, but it doesn't need to. The chemistry between Mike and Sulley carries the film and – although it doesn't reach the same emotional heights as the best Pixar films (the 'Toy Story' franchise, 'Wall-E' and 'Up') – it's still an enjoyable family film and a lot better than most cynically churned out prequels.",7,1,2,30 June 2013
What We Do in the Shadows," Wonderful Vampire Mockumentary
","'What We Do in the Shadows' is a fantastic New Zealand vampire mockumentary, no surprise considering Taika Waititi ('Thor Ragnarok' director) and 'Flight of the Conchords'' Jermaine Clement are involved.'...Shadows' is about a vampire sharehouse in Wellington, New Zealand - Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Jonny Brugh) and the 800-year-old Petyr (Ben Fransham) - filmed for a documentary. Their relatively cosy existence is interrupted when 20-year-old Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) is turned into a vampire and moves into the sharehouse, visited by his human best friend Stu (Stu Rutherford). Stu is such a likeable guy that the vampires - despite their hunger - refuse to eat him.The highlight of the movie is the dry New Zealand humour (similar to Conchords') contrasting the fantastical vampiric lore, with Stu - who works with Geodatabases - teaching the vampires about computers and mobiles. Other highlights are the werewolves, with Rhys Darby playing the alpha male Anton, and the clueless local police.Arguably the best vampire comedy since Leslie Nielsen's 'Dracula: Dead and Loving It', '...Shadows' is a welcome contrast from the wave of more serious vampire-themed TV series and movies.With Waititi gaining recognition after 'Thor Ragnarok', hopefully curious fans will check out '...Shadows'. It's well worth it. The good news is an American TV series is planned, so hopefully it does the movie justice.",10,1,1,17 February 2018
Beetlejuice," Batman Begins...as Beetlejuice
","'Beetlejuice' is famous as the film that launched Michael Keaton from comedy actor to Batman and superstardom.It's just as well, as this horror-comedy hasn't aged well. It's not particularly scary, nor is it that funny, despite Keaton's brilliance and Burton's fantastic visuals. Compare that to another eighties horror-comedy classic 'Gremlins', which had moments of genuine terror amongst the laughs.Keaton plays Beetlejuice as a mischievous bio-exorcist, with a few mild menacing moments. He's supposedly hired by the newly departed couple Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) to get rid of a snooty new family from their pre-death house. Beetlejuice is an anti-hero: you're never quite sure if he's a good guy or just looking out for himself and wanting to cause mayhem.Other highlights include Burton's fantastic array of undead beings and other monsters (the claymation technology has held up well for a late-eighties movie), showing off his love of the macabre and gruesome that would become a theme of his work, and a teenage Winona Ryder in one of her earlier roles.Plot-wise, the film never really goes anywhere, Beetlejuice is only in it for the second half, and the ending feels rushed.Still, it's really a vehicle for Keaton, Burton, and Ryder, so the plot doesn't really matter. The nostalgia value alone will be enough for most viewers.",7,0,2,25 February 2020
The Simpsons Movie," Long-awaited movie lives up to the hype
","For a series which has been as long running (currently into its nineteenth season) and as influential as 'The Simpsons', you figure the much anticipated movie would be on a hiding to nothing. Seemingly, anything less than a box-office smash would bring out the doomsdayers, calling for the show to die an honourable death. Fortunately, 'The Simpsons Movie' lives up to most expectations. There are plenty of jokes in its ninety minute duration, pop-culture gags (including Homer's Spider-Pig routine, which is sure to gain cult status amongst most Simpsons fans), and special appearances by Green Day (putting their own spin on Danny Elfman's theme, before being drowned 'Titanic' style) and Tom Hanks, as well as plenty of self-referential gags (including Homer stating 'why would we pay money for something we can see for free?'). Considering Homer Simpson's been the focal point of the show from the beginning, it's appropriate that everyone's favourite bald, yellow-skinned oaf dominates the main story. After throwing a silo of pig excrement  in a vat which suspiciously looks like a wang - into Lake Springfield, the US Government are forced to entomb Springfield into a giant dome, and the residents want Homer's blood. Facing a lynching, The Simpsons flee to Alaska to rebuild their lives. While I won't spoil the fun by giving away too much, suffice to say Homer must pull his family  and the town - from their do (o) med existence. There's also a small subplot of Lisa finding love with an Irish boy named Colin (who, he stresses, is not Bono's son). For a show which has garnered such a following, it's good to see that the fans are looked after in this movie. Not only are we treated to revised credit sequence (including a new chalkboard gag from Bart), but subtle references to past episodes (such as Homer calling Jesus 'Jebus'), and the added factor of nearly every character on the show making an appearance (with a hundred speaking parts), most of who can be seen in the angry mob marching to Homer's house. If anything, this movie is visually stunning; the animation is fluid and colourful, and the longer format allows for a lot more action-orientated set pieces than the show's usual twenty-two minute platform (literately starting with a bang with a scene from an 'Itchy and Scratchy' movie). It's quite a contrast to the early episodes of The Simpsons, which look almost prehistoric in comparison. While many believe the show is long past its prime, making this movie now, as opposed to a decade ago, allows for the more expansive action, which a show like this certainly deserves. Overall, The Simpsons movie lives up to expectations - though some hard-to-please fans are sure to find fault somewhere  and is, at times, laugh out loud funny, with plenty of its trademark topical humour, pop-culture references and the obligatory celebrities. Bring on the sequels.",9,5,11,3 August 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Ricky Bobby delivers big laughs
","When a movie has the pedigree of director Adam McKay (Anchorman, Forty-Year-Old-Virgin), and actors Will Ferrell (Anchorman, Old School), John C. Reilly (Chicago), Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G) and Michael Clarke Duncan (Daredevil, The Green Mile), expectations will be high. Fortunately, 'Talladega Nights: the ballad of Ricky Bobby', lives up the the pedigree, offering plenty of laughs. Ferrell plays the titular character, a big-hearted (and big-headed) NASCAR driver who lives life by his daddy's words; 'If you're not first, you're last.'. After starting life in the pit crew - led by Lucius Washington (Duncan)- Bobby's philosophy helped him become the greatest NASCAR driver in the south, much to the joy of his controlling trophy wife Carley (Leslie Bibb) and his two foul-mouthed kids. Bobby also isn't afraid to bow to the whim of commercialism - putting sponsorship on his Winfield, and fulfilling a contractual obligation to mention Powerade when saying grace).Aiding his cause is his best buddy Cal Naughton Jr (O' Reilly), who selflessly lets Bobby win, then celebrates with their trademark cry 'shake n' bake'. But their peaceful redneck existence (which includes fancy meals of Dominoes pizza, KFC and Taco Bell) is interrupted by the arrival of Jean Girrard (Cohen, with a ridiculous accent), a gay, French Formula One driver, who declares his intentions to usurp Bobby. After a horrible crash, Bobby goes into a mental breakdown, believing he's paraylsed (culminating in a hilarious scene involving a knife and Ferrel's leg, which rivals the 'hot wax' scene from 'Forty-Year-Old-Virgin' as the most cringe-inducingly hilarious moment). Following a failed comeback in a time trail, Bobby's life hits the skids. Carley leaves him for Cal, he's fired by his crew, is forced to move in with his mother, and takes an inglorious pizza delivery job. It's while working that he rediscovers his dad, Reese (Gary Cole) who abandoned Bobby when he was ten. Sympathising with his son's plight, Reese offers to bring Bobby back to his former glory. Some of his unorthodox methods include forcing Bobby to drive with a hungry cougar, dousing him with buckets of water, and strapping a bag of drugs to his car and calling the cops. Eventually, Bobby gets his confidence back, finds a new admirer, and faces off with Jacques for the Talladega 500.While the plot of Talladega may be 'paint-by-numbers', that doesn't matter, as the whole point of the movie, and others of its ilk, is how many laughs it gets. Plenty abound, including the aforementioned knife scene, which also involves Lucius and Cal trying to dig it out. Not to mention the moments when a post-crash Bobby runs around in his underwear, convinced he's on fire - which happens again following the failed time trial - to his pit crew's confusion. The film relies a lot on Ferrell's goofy personality (the same seen in Old School and Anchorman), letting the other characters play around him. McKay also pokes fun at the redneck community, including their homophobic, xenophobic outlook, and love for fast food.In summary, 'Talladega Nights' runs on the same vein as 'Old School', 'Anchorman.' or 'Forty-Year-Old Virgin' Needless to say, if you loved those movies, and Ferrell himself, then 'Talladega Nights' will be right down you alley.",8,0,1,7 October 2006
