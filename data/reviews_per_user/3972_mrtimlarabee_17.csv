"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Enjoyable, but a little predictable
","'Run, Fatboy Run' succeeds almost entirely on the strength of the comedic performances here. First thing the viewer needs to keep in mind is that this is not 'Hot Fuzz' or 'Shaun of the Dead.' That's not to say Pegg's performance isn't key to this film. It is. But it's a different kind of humor, including more broad physical comedy that we don't see in the aforementioned films.The basic premise of the film is that Simon Pegg's character, Dennis left his pregnant bride, Libby, at the altar. A few years later, his girlfriend has hooked up with Whit, played by Hank Azaria, who Dennis learns runs marathons. Wanting to prove himself to Libby, the out of shape Dennis decides to run in a marathon.The film is a fairly formulaic romantic comedy. Pegg, who co wrote the script relies not so much on dry sometimes subtle humor, but rather a broad physical humor. He's really good at it and reveals himself a more versatile comedian. The scened where he's working out and actually running attest to that.The other high point of the film is Gordon, played by Dylan Moran. Gordon is Dennis' friend and Libby's cousin. Dylan Moran has a way of inserting his own comedic personality into things, usually providing some sort of torment for others. This is no exception as he uses various means to urge Dennis to run. Moran is another performer with great comedic timing. He also gets some of the best lines.Hank Azaria plays Whit. Oddly enough, funny man Azaria gets the straight man role. That doesn't stop him from being entertaining as Dennis' antagonizer. He especially shines when he's trying to take jabs at Dennis' desire to run in the marathon.Overall, Run Fatboy Run applies a familiar romantic comedy formula. The story itself is rather straightforward and seems a little sophomoric. This film succeeds largely on its actors, especially Pegg and Moran. One strength this has over other rom coms is that despite the outrageous circumstances in the film, it does seem to have a genuine heart that gives the film a brief break from the usual rom com nonsense. It's worth a look, and enjoyable if you're willing to accept that this is a different kind of film than what Pegg has been doing.",7,3,6,11 March 2008
Requiem for a Dream," Devastating, grotesque masterpiece
","When I go to the museum, I am often awed at these still lifes from dutch painters of the 16th and 17th centuries. There were those beautiful still lifes, showing a vase of flowers down to the slightest detail. But oh, it would be the one that captured some sort of devastation or ugliness that would capture my attention. The strange thing was as devastating and grotesque one would be all the more beautiful and engrossing.What is beautiful about such a painting is the thing that makes Requiem for a Dream such a beautiful film. A true artist captures what he or she sees, lives, or feels. If the artist fails to do this, then they create a sugar coated work. It is satisfying for the moment, but ultimately fails to leave a lasting impression. Too often, 'artists' compromise their work for the sake of commercial success, painting 'beautiful' pictures that are often too common in the field. Requiem for a Dream defies this by painting a grotesque, gripping portrait of addiction. Not once does Darren Aronsky flinch in creating this pictures. It is at time ugly, grotesque, sick, and devastating. But like a classic still life, you can't turn away as you stare at every stark detail.What I love about this film is that you know your own in for a downhill ride when you begin the film. Jared Leto's character is taking his mother's TV to be sold to get drugs. This moment just scratches the surface of the downward spiral we are about to witness. Aronsky's characters suffer and never turn back. And nothing more need be said of Ellyn Burstyn's fantastic performance as she deals with delusion, drug addiction, and an addiction of a different sort, with the television.The film has a big finish which is one of the most classic scenes in American film. Although I imagine most pointed towards this review have seen it, I dare not spoil it. It's the final detail in the still life. The one that makes you stare and stare - not so much at its beauty, but its sheer unrelenting truth.",10,9,15,10 July 2007
Once," Like a musical Before Sunrise
","The Hollywood musical machine is back in full form with colorful designs, elaborate sets, and big name stars here to take Broadway to the big screen. Yet as combination of jukebox musicals and movies turned musicals turned movies yet again barrage the big screen, it's a simple little tale called 'Once' that takes an entirely different approach.'Once' is probably more minimalist than the Hollywood musical format. It has an interesting approach, in that the music in the film are mostly performance pieces. Yet they forward the story along more than most of the current crop of musicals.The story is quite simple. A Czech immigrant and poor Irishman meet and realize they share a fondness of music and start writing music together. Like any partnership, we see how their music progresses as well as their personal relationship.But this isn't some cheap love story or rags to riches story. Rather, the characters share their stories, their desires, and their feelings in the ever so brief but affective spoken dialogue, and flesh them out in their songs. It doesn't have any sugar coated artificial sentiment either. There's a sincerity that flows in the characters throughout the film.The characters in this film seem very real. Perhaps its their struggling nature and that they aren't larger than life characters. One of my favorite scenes in the movie summarizes both the normalcy of the characters and their sincere passion towards art. There is a scene where the girl is listening to music and trying to think of words to write for it and is so caught up in it that she gets frustrated when the batteries run out on the CD player and scrambles trying to find them. It's a simple yet beautiful scene that captures the spirit of the film.What makes the film such a fantastic feel good film is the friendship between the two main characters and the special bond they have. The chance encounter and how they accomplish much in such a little time reminded me very much of Before Sunrise. I have a feeling if that were a musical, it might look something like Once, an excellent, simple feel good musical.",10,3,6,28 January 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Both Afflecks shine in slow burning mystery
","'Gone Baby Gone' is a well done mystery. But it's slow to thrill you and doesn't put you on the edge of your seat, though you will be guessing things to the very end. But the filmmakers give you something else to take from this film besides a mystery. A clue to this should be the gentle narration at the beginning of the film from Patrick Kenzie, played by Casey Affleck, talking about how he knows everyone. We see flashes of people in a Massachusetes neighborhood, with Patrick going up and greeting them. It's an excellent setup for Patrick's down to earth tactics in approaching his cases - and for his general principles.'Gone Baby Gone' is ultimately a morality tale. It's a society tale as well. The main conflict in the story revolves around the disappearance of a little girl named Amanda. Patrick and his girlfriend Michelle are hired to investigate the disappearance of the girl. Their reactions to the case are key to the story. In many ways, the heart of the story is reaction to such atrocities.For those reactions, we are given several views, from the victimized parents, to the neighbors, to the different police officers attached to the case, including the hard, veteran Detective Remy, played with precision by Ed Harris and the police Captian Doyle, a minor but pivotal role for Morgan Freeman. Ben Affleck uses this palette of characters to paint a painful morality tale about children in society.This is a film about children. It's about our sometimes condescending views towards parents and asks the question what would you do when you see that sort of injustice. Working in a field involving children, this film struck a chord. Ben Affleck directs the film as if looking for a right answer to injustices against children without burying the film in manipulative sentiment. It's an insightful affair and a good vehicle for Casey Affleck as actor and good feature directorial debut for big brother Ben.",9,1,1,20 February 2008
The Orphanage," Both human and horrifying - possible spoilers
","If you've ventured into cinemas watching a horror movie as of late, you've probably been treated with a few screams and shocks, but after leaving the theater, the experience is over. And while you enjoyed the film's fear factor, you probably talk about how 2 dimensional the films protagonists are and how you're glad they died in the 2nd reel.If you remember watching some of the best horror films in recent memory, then you might remember a time when a film sent shivers down your spine and lingered with you well after the closing credits. The Orphanage is a classic ghost story that stays with you. The story is fairly straightforward, but the combination of fear and emotion cause the audience to experience the fear of our heroine, Laura.My favorite scene in the film is in the beginning, where we see a young Laura playing with the other children at the orphanage just before she is to be adopted out. It's a simple scene that is very short, but provides a great setup for the rest of the film.Years later, an adult Laura comes back to the orphanage with her husband and her adopted son, Simon. She has the intention of opening it to service children with special needs. Simon has alleged imaginary friends that play with him. When he mysteriously disappears, Laura starts questioning if these friends are imaginary or if they are indeed ghosts.What I love about this film is the genuine fear felt by the viewer. So often in modern horror movies, we are treated with false shocks and teases of something frightening that isn't really there. These types of shocks have become formulaic and predictable. In 'The Orphanage,' you often know something is coming. You're just terrified of what it might be.I also like this film's relationship with the supernatural. When Laura starts to feel that Simon's imaginary friends might be real, she has interesting interaction with the alleged ghosts. This is one of those films that sets forth its rules quite clearly about how the dead function.What I love above all is the human nature in this film. There is a reason Guillermo Del Toro's name is lent as executive producer to this film. His two well known Spanish films, Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, deal with injustices towards children. While this is more of a traditional horror tale, it's still easy to see a few similarities between this and his work, notably the Devil's Backbone.I wouldn't say this is the horror movie to end all horror movies, but it's certainly far better than Hollywood horror yarn that usually triumphs at the box office. It's smart, well acted, and has a heart. At the end, it lingers with you for a long while. I seriously haven't felt this way after leaving a horror film since the 6th Sense, to which this film owes a little dept.",9,5,8,13 January 2008
Control," It maybe myth, but it's some darn fine film making
","In '24 Hour Party People,' the character Tony Wilson quips that when it comes down to choosing between truth and legend that the legend makes a better story. Many Joy Division fans (and from news reports, members of the band) felt that Control bought into the myths surrounding the band: The contract signed in blood, that Ian Curtis was this dark mysterious figure and perhaps that the whole Joy Division story was depressing as their music.So while 24 Hour Party People was a kind of fun, tongue in cheek take on some of the era, Control is something of the antithesis of that. It may also be a little biased as some of it was based on Ian Curtis's estranged wife's book. But Corbijn's camera is so focused that truth or not, this is a fine movie.Anton Corbijn's film reminds me of indie films of an era past. When Jim Jarmusch started making movies he used black and white, long takes and stark looks at the film's characters. That's sort of what Corbijn does. It's not a stretch from his photography. Control is a portrait of Ian Curtis, possibly more as myth than actual man, but a portrait nonetheless.Sam Riley has a lot resting on his shoulders in this performance, as he plays a man who is somewhat getting lost in his own world, growing distant from the world around him, often at a loss for words in every part of his life, but his music. He sees something that moves him, like a girl going into an epileptic seizure, and gazes at it and writes about it. That this film will be a blip on many US audiences' radar is a real shame because this performance is golden.Control is emotional without being melodramatic. There's a simplicity in the style of the film and performances that allow emotions to flow all over the screen. But they are sad ones. If I have a complaint about the film it's that it lacks any sort of real humor. That maybe the problem with buying into the myth, but I guess with Ian Curtis's story you can't be wishing for happy endings.",8,2,4,23 November 2007
Across the Universe," Chaotic, but beautiful
","Julie Taymor was not shy about saying there wasn't much dialogue in the film. There is a share of dialogue, but mostly to transition to the next musical scene - no large bodies of text or academy award winning speeches. This is a musical to its very core. It has a lot of ideas and there's always a lot going on. Most of it works.The 90s onward have been cursed with jukebox musicals, using an artist's songbook for the story. While Across the Universe does this, it doesn't spin some hackneyed Vegas style musical together and instead uses the Beatles songbook very appropriately, detailing lovelorn tales, drugs, and the ever so political decade of the sixties.So it shouldn't surprise anyone that while the songs are used mostly to tell a love story of Lucy and Jude, the plot plays merely a supporting role to the images and performances that the Beatles songs inspire. The ones that stuck out to me were 'She's So Heavy' which was transformed into a nightmarish image of individuals reporting for the draft and 'Strawberry Fields Forever,' offering perhaps the best narrative portion of the film were the two male protagonists use it as a vehicle to state their conflicts. It functions well on a dramatic and aesthetic level.But with all the wealth of ideas, there are a couple missteps. The amount of characters can be overwhelming. It mostly works, but Prudence could've easily been excised from the script, as she is merely a subplot and her take on 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' comes off as unintentionally funny.My only other complaint is that a little too much time is spent on some 'Drug tripping' sequences. While it's appropriate to the times, it seems more like a way for Taymor to do more visual work, which is fine because the scenes look fantastic.And I guess that's what it boils down to. The performances and visuals stand out so much in this film that it's hard not to recommend even with the chaotic overflow of characters, subplots and sometimes bizarre imagery. It's a feast for the senses and thoroughly enjoyable.",8,2,5,23 November 2007
Paranormal Activity," Preys on primal fears
","Is Paranormal Activity really that good? Is it worth all the hype? It achieves its goal and then some. That's enough to say it's at least worth a watch. I don't know if the acting is great, and neither of the leads are what we would categorize as glamorous. But does any of that really matter. This film is scary, and let me tell you why.Horror films come by a formula now. To me there are rules that are followed that work really well. The Hitchock idea of suspense - that we already know something terrible will happen. He builds it up - and then doesn't show us the act. So we've built this horrifying vision in our head. In Psycho, we see the knife, but not the act. We're then afraid of showers.Then there's another formula for horror that works. Isolation. This was mastered by George Romero. He imprisons his characters - be it in an old house or a shopping mall. That there's really nowhere to go keeps our characters hopeless. Again, we're waiting for the inevitable. It's the how that's got us spooked.So why spend a review talking about other films? Because Paranormal Activity successfully combines these two elements and ups the ante. In the Hitchock sense, the film begins with a title card thanking the families of the main characters, alluding to something horrible that has happened to them. We're just waiting to learn how. In a classic Hitchcock way, suspense is built. We never see what is actually causing the said activity, and the most horrifying things don't happen on screen. So we're left to imagine how horrible it is.Then there's the Romero element of isolation. This is where the film takes two clever turns. For one, it sets a rule for itself, that the characters might as well stay in their house because it doesn't matter where they are. That gives the director no reason to shift the characters elsewhere. So he keeps them in a place that by audience standards is the safest place in the world: their room. The scene of the camera videotaping the characters as they sleep as they hear things go bump in the night is horrifying because it preys on a primal fear of ours. We relate to this, and that the image is repeated, it keeps the audience on edge. This is the most terrifying form of isolation imagined, robbing us of our one safe haven. That's why the film is so scary.The interesting thing about this film is that you can't look at the traditional elements of film alone (ie screenplay, direction, acting). Is it gimmicky? A little. There's the sense that it looks real. But I don't point to the documentary feel. I think it's just that the director didn't need to come up with anything new to scare us. He just took those things that go bump in the night and put into a movie - which hopefully survives the hype that has surrounded it.",9,2,4,17 October 2009
The Hangover Part II," Sort of like watching a rerun of a really good episode
","The Hangover was a one joke premise that stretched into a slew of laughs. It's safe to say that a similar premise would work and be equally as funny. The problem with 'The Hangover II' is that it has some good jokes, and its enjoyable to watch, but, like an all too faithful cover song, it's wayyyy too familiar and it lacks originality.My real issue with it is that the premise is too similar to the first. Guys take bride/groom brother with them, have wild night, forget everything, have to find him. The repeat premise and some of the gags are almost cringeworthy. It's almost as if it's the same script with a little cut and paste work done on the gags for good measure.But some of the jokes are funny. Most of the humor works because the guys are discovering what they did for the evening and forgot. It's when we see this stuff that we laugh. A couple of the outrageous moments involving Stu are hilarious.But then there's that stuff that drags or the stuff that's too derivative. What's the deal with Paul Giamatti - such a great actor in a small part without much to do. Or the fact that some of their hijinks involves more action than humor that it seems the film, as we near the end, is going through the motions.Perhaps the first one relied so heavily on the premise that it became a novelty film, and shouldn't have been repeated so faithfully. If there is a Hangover 3, it better have a big dose of originality. If they tried to imitate the premise again, wed end up in Friday the 13th land..and I don't think I could take another 10 of these.",5,1,3,7 June 2011
The Dark Knight," Dark, grim, and magnificent
","Superhero movies have become about as ubiquitous now as disaster movies were about a decade ago. Similarly, there's been something of a followed formula with these said films. Spiderman was exciting. X-men brought us a certain human element. Then there will subsequent sequels, filled with CGI and piling on more and more faces. As the screen got more cluttered, we cared less and less about the characters.Enter the 'Dark Knight,' the literate sequel to to 'Batman Begins.' This is unlike any superhero movie that has been put on the screen. The color and the humor of Batman's theatrical past have vanished,no one has any superpowers, and the conflicts presented to Batman reach far beyond a painted up madman.Christopher Nolan's take on Batman injects a pulse in the comic book to film genre by reminding us how Batman is different from all those other superheroes. He is human. The script, penned with Nolan's brother, forces Bruce Wayne/Batman to deal with the moral complications of his character. For the first time on screen, we really feel how a 'superhero's' actions may have dire consequences.But the Dark Knight is a carefully paced story that doesn't provide simple answers. Heath Ledger's manic Joker, who sounds like Tom Waits when he's doing poetry or on stage banter, is the most vile of villains captured on screen. Rather than making him a simple evil doer, Nolan crafts the character as a foil for the very existence of Batman. Ledger's performance drives the character into unchartered territory.But beyond the fight between the Joker and Batman are a well casted group of characters that Nolan chooses to not simply introduce and waste, as in other superhero films, but to makes us actually care about. Fans of Batman may have an idea about Harvey Dent's character, but this portrayal might be the best of both comic and film. The likable Aaron Eeckhart portrays him as a character we root for and he is constructed so well that his final act in the film never seems superfluous, as his character has been treated in other versions of Batman.Perhaps the most striking thing about this film is that it inadvertently poses the question, 'What if Batman was Real?' It might look like the Dark Night, where the line between good and evil and right and wrong looks grayer and grayer. It's appropriately titled, as this is an extremely dark film with no clear cut answers. The words, images, and pictures play like poetry, as 'The Dark Knight' raises the bar for superhero films.",10,2,6,27 July 2008
Grindhouse," 'Grindhouse' a fun experience
","'Grindhouse' leads to a tricky situation when it comes to talking about the film. Do we discuss the individual films for their merits and their weaknesses or look at it as a whole? Is this a unique work or a pastiche of the grindhouse sub-genre of films? Did the public by and large actually get it? The answer to that last question is no. For the rest, it all depends on the audience.For me, watching 'Grindhouse' was an experience unto itself. Unless midnight shows start cropping up, I fear it's one that won't be repeated. Let it be said that it was a great, fun movie-going experience. The idea of a double feature alone made it worth the price of admission. The quality of the two films was great while the trailers were just hilarious.'Planet Terror' is Robert Rodriguez's homage to zombie films. He plays up the grindhouse experience more than Tarantino by displaying many conventions of the schlocky genre, including more than one gratuitous female shot in the first 5 minutes and the much talked about 'missing reel' that probably threw your run of the mill theater goer for a curve. He also throws in a number of intentionally 2 dimensional characters full of faux emotions. Rodriguez's contribution is funny, clearly laughing at itself throughout the film. Rodriguez is a visual director and his fun effects are always worth a look, notably Ros Macgowan's leg/gun - it's used to great effect. 'Planet Terror' is almost parody. As it's intentionally camp, viewers may be turned off if they're looking for a good scare. 'Planet Terror' has its tongue firmly planted in cheek.'Death Proof' is probably the more original of the two films and it's originality really seeps in after a couple viewings. Of particular note is how Tarantino successfully plays up the suspense in the first half with Kurt Russel as Stuntman Mike. We know what's going to happen, but Tarantino has a lot of fun with the payoff. The second half of the film is a really fun chase movie. It's very original, while still paying homage to the celebrated grindhouse genre.Then there are those trailers. Rodriguez's 'Machete' is probably the coolest, but Rob Zombie's 'Werewolf Women of the SS' is just hilarious. These are just those extra special ingredients that made this such a fun experience.In the end, that's what this film is - an experience. I had the pleasure of watching this at the Alamo Drafthouse, where we were treated to real grindhouse trailers beforehand, adding to the fun. I doubt seeing this film again will have the same effect. The Weinstein's handling of the DVD releases of the films by themselves has been telling of this. They are enjoyable, but nowhere near as much side by side without the trailers. That being said, it's hard to look at each film by itself without taking in the whole experience.",9,0,0,30 March 2008
There Will Be Blood," An excellent study of greed, corruption, and pure evil
","On the surface, There Will Be Blood looks like a historical account of the cutthroat oil business at the turn of the 20th century. However, one needs to remember that this is a work of fiction with a historical backdrop. Then you need to remember that this is the work of Paul Thomas Anderson.The opening sequence sets the tone for the film, as a lone oil man drills for oil. It's a physically laborious task and Anderson carefully takes the time to show us what it is these men do. A good amount of the first reel has no dialogue, just showing the work, set to a haunting score. We now know we aren't watching a typical historical film.The film focuses on Daniel Plainview and his son. Daniel has received a tip about land on the Sunday ranch which may contain vast amounts of oil. He goes up with his son to investigate and once he has found the tip was worth its weight in gold, he relentlessly pursues every piece of land nearby, cutting questionable deals left and right. His relentlessness will result in tragedies, and yes, as the title implies, there will be blood.Anderson is not doing a film about oil. The oil stands for something much greater. It's much like gold and in essence greed. What is one man willing to set aside in order to be successful. About halfway through the film, Daniel shares a conversation with his alleged brother that gets to the core of Daniel.Anderson's direction is excellent, though varied from his other works. He usually relies on a good sized ensemble cast, but this film rests primarily on the shoulders of Daniel Day Lewis, who has got the hustle and bustle dealing of an oil man down so well, you might be misled by some of the things he says. He's perfect and his performance is definitely Oscar worthy.Equally noteworthy is Paul Dano, who plays an older child on the Sunday ranch named Eli, who seeks just payment for the land to help build his church where he is considered a spiritual healer. He is looked upon questionably by Daniel, who many times shows his disdain for Eli.The universal themes in this film transcend the historical context of the film. In many ways now and in the past, oil is a symbol for greed. Anderson uses Daniel to explore this concept with great detail. The careful study of greed and evil comes to a dramatic conclusion that is quintessential Paul Thomas Anderson. The closing of this film sets this film apart from other works of historical fiction in that Anderson has no qualms about showing the (sometimes ugly)nature of his characters.",10,1,7,28 January 2008
WALL·E," Pixar proves they're infallible, once again
","One of the greatest assets of Pixar besides always raising the bar on animation is storytelling. Beyond that, they have the ability to take characters or basic plots that sound okay at best and make them first class entertainment, both on a commercial and artistic level. This was the case with Cars, as talking cars seemed to not be on par with the humanity of Pixar's prior scripts. But they pulled it off, making a highly enjoyable film. Wall-E does the same.Admittedly, I was not immediately attracted to the idea, as robots in computer animated fare is hardly anything new, as numerous shorts and a whole film had come earlier. There was also the early head's up that a good portion of this film didn't have dialogue, leading one to believe that Pixar would shed its storytelling in favor of fantastic visuals. Not so.The marvel of Wall-E is the ability to tell a story with little to no dialogue. Pixar's people know that the visual's serve to enhance the story, not replace it. The film begins on a deserted earth, with Wall-E, a robot designed to clean up earth while everyone is away in space. He's alone. He collects knick knacks and as we can see from his collection, has developed heart. He's attracted to a love scene and dance number in 'Hello Dolly.' The brilliant animation conveys so much emotion in Wall-E's robotic face. Besides some advertisements for the 'Buy N' Large' corporation and the Hello Dolly clip, the first third of the film is spent with little to no words. The rich landscape and our attraction to Wall-E's little gestures are all we need to tell the story.The rest of the film is focused Wall-E and Eve, a robot sent to find life on earth, and their attempts to save the one bit of plant life found on earth, as well as themselves and the rest of mankind. It's a cute story and it has a lot of heart. But the film also has more depth in terms of its message. It shows a society becoming dependent on technology, thus becoming overweight and unable to care for themselves or even appreciate what exists beyond TV, shopping, and consumerism. And the obvious message about protecting earth from over pollution, or it won't be able to sustain life.If kids don't get the message, that's fine. However, the gifted folks at Pixar told the story so well, that I wouldn't be surprise if the message does sink into children, as the vivid pictures clearly convey the story's message. It doesn't really have any political slant either (those on the far right think otherwise), as it's a simple message to clean up. There is some satire criticizing our current administration and consumer culture that may not reach the little ones, but is no less enjoyable to them because it's there.So can Pixar do any wrong? If Wall-E demonstrates the caliber these guys are capable of now, probably not. They don't have a bad film and they demonstrate that animation is real, honest film making. Outside of Japan and Studio Ghibli maybe, there are no real contenders in the field of animation who have been able to mix groundbreaking animation and rich storytelling. Wall-E has raised the bar, as it's one of Pixar's best to date.",10,0,2,23 November 2008
Blade Runner," Excellent, no matter which version your watching
","I think I've owned 3 different versions of this film at one time and can finally 'retire' my old versions after being dished the final cut alongside the versions I grew up with.To be fair, the first version I saw of this was on home video and included the now infamous voice overs and happy ending. I loved that version. Given, Harrison Ford's voice over sounds like he wasn't taking the ordeal too seriously, it unintentionally provided another layer for the movie.One of the things that stood out in Ridley Scott's vision of the future was how America was more than a melting pot, it was a blur of images of past, present, future and a blur of culture and ethnicity. In a word, it was a blur of identity. The voice-over, love it or hate it, always gave an almost non-time feel to the movie, combining old fashioned detective film noir to a gloomy, messy future. Looking back, many of the narrations feel silly, but it still added an additional layer to the film.Looking forward, the director's cut creates a different film. That idea of identity is further explored as the lack of narration makes Deckard's thoughts more ambiguous as his own identity is questioned. This version always created a sense of isolation and curiosity. Ridley Scott's vision seems more authentic.I always loved the non-CGI visual effects of the film, which still hold up to this day (if you don't believe that, then do not wait for the 5 disc DVD - rush to a city showing it on the big screen). In the early 80s, sci fi films were popular and while many were experimenting with new technologies, a lot of Blade Runner is old fashioned models, which blow away ANY CGI (note to George Lucas, Robert Zemekis and all cgi aficionados everywhere). The sets were great - the muddled future, looking like a New York Nightmare.But the simple story is what still stands out. Brushed off as a gloomy search and destroy pic in its original release, viewers now see the questions the film raises about humanity and identity, perhaps also raising eyebrows about how it all fits into science. The acting was always top notch, notably from Rutger Hauer who appears first as a classic villain but shows much more depth in his limited screen time. He's also got the best dialogue.Whatever version you watch of Blade Runner, you're always in for a classic. The vision of this film is unprecedented and something about it remains fresh 25 years on. If you haven't seen it - watch it now. If you have, watch it again. There's always something new to discover about this classic.",10,8,15,12 December 2007
Donnie Darko," Dark, funny, creepy, and full of questions to wrap your brain around
","Donnie Darko has something to do with time travel and something to do with fate. The fun of the film is that it asks a lot of questions and doesn't provide many answers. It creates a strange mythology that boggles minds upon repeat viewings. The fun of watching the film is that people find themselves developing many theories. Any film that achieves cult status involves a certain mythology, like we've found ourselves in the middle of something grand and we're only given a glimpse of whats actually going on. Donnie Darko is a well crafted 'hero' of sorts. To what end is up to the viewer to decide. He's horribly flawed yet has a huge burden to carry as we approach the closure of the film.What is often overlooked about this film is the deconstruction of 80s suburbia. 'The end of the world' is often mentioned in the film and Donnie Darko's character is often unraveling those uncomfortable truths about a hidden facade of safety in suburbia. His family looks perfect in the very beginning til they start cursing and discussing politics at the dinner table. What kids are learning at school is questioned by an ignorant parent, while they question vandalism at the school. The local clean cut celebrity Dr. Cunningham has a dark secret. Suddenly their world becomes a little unsafe, all thanks to Donnie Darko. All this is done with a dark, and devilish sense of humor.I didn't care for the director's cut as much. The fun of this film is in its mythos and lack of explanation. The sci fi fantasy of the film is great as well as the suburban satire. Read too much into it, you might enjoy it less. To me though, the film seems to be a happy accident, as Richard Kelly, in all his indulgences, hasn't reproduced this kind of magic. It's a special near perfect film that loses its enjoyment with too much analysis.",10,1,3,16 September 2009
V for Vendetta," Exciting Flick and Insightful Cautionary Tale
","Discount the fact that this is adapted from Alan Moore's wonderful comic, and you'll find a film that retains a lot of the great elements of the source material while combining enough elements in its own right to create a well timed film that is both exciting, and though-provoking.First off, this is a fun film to watch. It is full of action, suspense, and very interesting characters. V is presented initially as a vigilante, acting against the government with a sort of madness that like our heroine, Evey, we can't decide if he's insane or if he's right. V is a very literate, skilled fighter. Though some may mistake the acting as a bit too much melodrama, Hugo Weaving plays him quite well, capturing the madness, mystique, and the overall marvel of our hero. As Evey, Natalie Portman plays her with initial curiosity and fear and shifts the character as strong and independent over the course of the film. Given the larger than life premise of the film, the believability of the actors is one of the key successes of this film. Rounding out the cast are Stephen Rea, comedian Stephen Fry, and the infallible John Hurt, playing a highly unlikeable High Chancellor.The subject matter of the film has come under much debate, as V is clearly noting that something is very wrong with the country he and his fellow citizens live in. He chooses to act and encourages others to act against a government that is robbing the country of its freedoms. Though not quite 1984, the film illustrates a government not far removed from some of our fears today. V drops quotes throughout the movie as a sort of warning and foreshadowing about the power the people have over the government. The finale can be seen as an act of just retaliation or an act of terrorism, depending on your viewpoint. The story is told in such a way, that it is, to me, brilliant satire, exhilarating and fun to watch, without being too preachy.That the source material is almost 20 years old and that the themes in the story are even more timed today illustrates the brilliance of the story. But this is also a fun film to watch. There are fun action scenes throughout this film, including some great knife play by V and a very chilling third act. Intelligent, and fun, the film is a cautionary tale timed very well in these troubled times.",9,3,6,3 August 2006
Semi-Pro," Hate to rehash the reviews, but it is indeed only semi funny
","Semi Pro is half good. It starts off great. We are introduced with Jackie Moon's big hit 'Love Me Sexy' and learn that his team, The Flint Tropics team isn't that good and Moon spent his money for the team really for his love of basketball.The first half is great, as it applies a usual Will Ferrel formula - have a very basic plot to allow Will Ferrel and co to display their antics with really little attention to the plot. We go to see Ferrel display his antics after all. The best display of this is when Jackie Moon and some of his friends are playing a poker game. It has some of the fun ad libbed dialogue Ferrel's movies are known for and is one of those scenes you know will have outtakes on the DVD.The film's failure is it's plot. In a Will Ferrel movie, Ferrel should be the center of attention, yet as the plot moves forward, that honor seems to pass to Woody Harrleson, who's good in his role, but doesn't supply the necessary humor the film needs. Meanwhile, Ferrel is left with little to do except for some of the wacky bits like Ferrel wrestling a bear.So as the film progresses, there is a feeling of the usual basketball film, where the rag tag team tries their best to be successful. In all this, the humor seems to be dissipating, and the Ferrel machine seems to be running out of gas. Really a shame, because the promotional materials for this movie were hilarious.",5,17,28,28 March 2008
