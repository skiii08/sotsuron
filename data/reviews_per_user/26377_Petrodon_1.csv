The Blair Witch Project," Are you scared of the dark?
","I liked it.  But then, that doesn't say a whole lot about the film now does it.  I like other things too.  This film is frightening, again no justice to it.  And, I think that this movie needs more then just an 'R' rating.  It should come with about tenfold more warnings on it then it has.  This movie needs explanations of how frightening it really is.  So here are a list of things it is most likely in your best interest to know before you see this film.1. This is not a horror movie.  This film gets into what, in a very realistic way, really scares us, deep inside.  We aren't scared of Freddy Kruger or Jason, because they aren't real and never could be.  This film scares you in a way you haven't ever been scared before, by a movie at least.  The real human terror, the kind you see when you look in the face of Ted Bundy, Andre Chikatilo, and Jeffrey Dahmer is what this film gives you. Only more, because the terror has no face.  The true nature of this film can be detrimental to sanity.2. This film is not for everyone.  Having an 'R' rating, being a horror flick, maybe you might think this would be a good date movie.  Again you have been warned, this film is not like any other horror film ever made. I don't think those that are feint of heart should go to this film. Parents, don't let your kids go see this, seniors, I respect your age but perhaps this might be a good film to skip. Finally, if you fear the dark,  or ever have in the past, do not see this.  Yes, I liked it, but sometimes I think I should have never have seen this film.3. This film may be too good at what it does.  The Blair Witch Project could be the scariest film ever made, perhaps too scary.In short, this film is scared the crap out of me.  I do understand how someone expecting to see a standard horror film might be disappointed at this film, but I wasn't.  If you can take it, then this film comes highly recommended.",Null,1,2,10 June 1999
