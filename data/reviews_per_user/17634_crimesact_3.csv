Blade Runner 2049," Good not brilliant
","I'm a hard critic of sequels and this is one Sequel that doesn't get out of 2nd gear. Blade Runner the 1st movie was brilliant and an easy 10 out of 10 the sequel tried to hard to meet the same expectations and was a let down. Perfect actors that worked well with the script they had, but the storyline was the biggest let down and didn't take the audience on the same futuristic ride as the 1st movie. My personal opinion would be to watch it but don't have your expectations that high that you think the standard will meet the first movie.",6,1,6,11 April 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," Roller coaster of a life time
",DiCaprio's performance was like a brand new car coming out of the show room and you drive away in for the first time knowing you own it. A very well polished performance that makes you feel part of the story.You hit the highs with him you hit the lows and you hit the absolute hilarious moments that had me in tears laughing so hard.One movie that would always make my top ten in any Genre well maybe accept in a horror Genre lol.10 out of 10 all round great performances from all actors.,10,1,4,3 December 2019
Blade Runner," Pure mystical timeless classic
",I remember watching this when I was about 12 years old and I was left blown away. I am now 45 years old and can still watch this and love every second of it. Not many movies I can say that about but this movie is an all time classic.,10,2,2,16 April 2020
