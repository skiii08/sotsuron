The Blair Witch Project," JAHA's Kick Ass Review
","Alright,alright,this is no big studio wonder, but as an independent film, this is as good as they come. Starts a little slow, and ends with too little. But its not all that bad It kicks little,2 and a half out of 4 starsOk,here's The Devilishe's Hot Picks(another view of the film)-you'll have more fun getting your toe-nails pulled out.  All of the hype for this movie(it doesn't even deserve to be called a movie) got the people who were involved in it a lot of money.As for the people who watched it,they got a $6.50 nap.  Write your congressman,crap like this shoudn't be on the big screen.This movie should be viewed by people in prison,if threat of the electric chair won't detour crime being strapped in  a chair and forced to watch this will.your hoping all the characters get killed FOR SUBJECTING YOU TO THIS CORPORAL PUNISHMENT!!!!!!!!!",3,0,1,6 August 1999
