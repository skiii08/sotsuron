The Blair Witch Project," Blah witch project!
","I seen this movie a long time ago after it came out on VHSback around 2000. I seen all the hype on TV so I thought this must be good. Boy,was I ever in for a surprise. Disappointment and boredom is the key words I'm reaching for. This movie has got to be one of the boringest,over-hyped films of all time.The acting sucked,the actress was a dog,no female titty shots or sex scenes to keep the audience interested. There was no scares,the ones they did have were so lame I literally yawned. I haven't seen the film since and I prefer to keep it that way. How some people find work god only knows but I hope anyone involved today is working at some fast food burger joint. I would of given the movie a zero if I could. One of the worst movies ever made.",1,1,5,10 July 2006
Pearl Harbor," Sad waste!
","This movie wouldn't of been so bad if it wasn't for the terrible performances from it's leads: Josh,Ben and Kate. Totally to be expected from Ben Affleck though since almost every one of his movies sucks big time.The movie doesn't start getting good til like 2 hour some minutes into the flick when the japs bomb Pearl Harbor and that's really sad. Thank your lucky stars though VCRs and DVD players have fast forward buttons. In this movie you will be needing it unless you want to watch of course a romance between 3 people that was so terribly acted they should really be ashamed. If they wanted an interesting triangle to this dull romance they could of written in a 3 some. Might of well have,probably would of drawn in more interest.After the first half it starts to get better,to watch events that actually happened like some history lesson but with special effects...Yay...to make you forget about the crappy start to this so so movie.This movie wasn't too bad in action and special effects but the chemistry sucks between the actors. How can you get over a guy after 3 months after his death. Can anyone say slut? Harlet's the more appropriate word for Kate Pukingsdale.John Voight was great as always as FDR,even though I read some where FDR didn't actually get up I think he had help or some sh*t like that.The ending where *spoiler alert* one of the lead actors die,I could not have been more gleeful although they killed off the wrong one. If you can stomach the poor romantic performances in the beginning without heaving then you might enjoy this flick. If not then good news there is an option...the fast forward button.",Null,5,9,16 June 2006
