Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Some critics are born losers....
","I do not see the problem with TPM, I thought it was an excellent addition to the Star Wars Series, being a Die-hard Star Wars fan myself, I loved this movie, enough to see it on several occasions, which, I must say I recommend, because the 2nd or 3rd time you pick up a lot of stuff you may have missed the first time. So therefore, TPM deserves a lot more respect and is a milestone in the movie business.",7,0,0,10 July 1999
Memento," 'Memento' - A Tale Masterfully Crafted
","Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' is an intriguing crime thriller that engaged me from beginning to end (or is that end to beginning?). Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) suffers from a condition. He can't make new memories. He is searching for a man who raped and murdered his wife, using Polaroid photographs and tattoos to remind himself every time his memory is wiped. He befriends Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) & Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) to help him carry out his deed: Kill the man who murdered his wife. Definitely the most riveting crime thriller in years, and easily the best movie of 2000/2001. Do not miss 'Memento' and don't believe anything not made in Hollywood isn't worth watching -- 'Memento' proves you don't need a big budget to keep an audiences attention and to tell a good story.",10,0,1,2 October 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Amazing Fantasy Spectacle
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the mystical story of legendary Chinese warriors Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien. These are the two focus characters, but the story also tells the tales of a loyal Chinese guard, a troubled young noble and an evil villainess. This seems to be a very complex story, but the plot is actually quite simple and easy to grasp for younger viewers. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon illustrates the best in martial arts action, adventure, romance, drama and fantasy and even humour in one captivating film. This was one of the best, if not the best, films I've ever seen. It has a little bit of everything for everyone, including a deeper sense of spirituality and belief in ancient martial arts techniques (I wish I could be lighter than air like that!). Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has been nominated for several Academy Awards including Best Foreign Picture and Best Picture. Do not miss this film.",10,0,0,19 February 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix Unraveled
","If there ever was a movie that seemed impossible to top, it was the Wachowski Brothers' 1999 super-smash THE MATRIX. Well these brothers set out to do just that and accomplished it above and beyond any expectations I had with THE MATRIX RELOADED.Not only is it a technically superior film, with visual effects to make George Lucas envious, but the story and philosophy behind the Matrix is expanded as well. We are introduced to new characters, new concepts and new revelations about the Matrix, its origins and its functions.Seeing the first film is a must because all of the main characters have been so well established in THE MATRIX that this sequel is focused simply on expanding those characters. Without prior knowledge from the first film you will undoubtedly become lost in the maze of philosophical and thematic outpourings offered up in this film.The final verdict? THE MATRIX RELOADED is the must-see film this year and will have your heart thumping all throughout the incredible kung-fu action sequences, the breathtaking visual effects scenes and the shocking revelations about the Oracle, Zion and the Matrix itself.Now the only question remaining is: they topped THE MATRIX, but can they top THE MATRIX RELOADED? We'll find out in November.",8,0,0,21 May 2003
Gladiator," Clarification on a great movie
","'Gladiator', the fictional story of Maximus Decimus Meridius, is an excellent movie. There is a deep spirituality to the movie, an unraveling romance and breath-taking action sequences. Superb acting by the leads and supporters (Jaoquin Phoenix was incredible as evil Emperor Commodus) adds to the spectacle that is Gladiator. Ridley Scott hits the mark with his latest masterpiece. Now for some clarification. Some critics, professional and Internet-based alike, have stated that 'Gladiator's' storyline strays away from the actual historical events that took place in ancient Rome. Please do your homework before you blatantly bash the credibility of a movie: at the end of 'Gladiator' there is a disclaimer: 'Although some characters were taken from actual historical events, the STORY IS FICTION'. Therefore, they can use the names but can write their own story. On a final note, Hans Zimmer has composed another amazing score. His other works include 'The Rock', 'Crimson Tide' and 'Backdraft'",9,0,0,9 February 2001
