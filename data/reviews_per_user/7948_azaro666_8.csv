The Blair Witch Project," If all that hype had never happened
","If all that hype had never happened and we had the privilege of watching this movie completely free of thought or conciusness. I envy my sister, she saw this movie not knowing anything of the hype. After she watched it she thought it was all real and was traumatised. I had not the pleasure but the brilliance of this film was still apparent. Sure this is a one-off movie which can never be bettered if imitated but this is without doubt the film of a generation. All those blood-scary movies we watched as kids where the thought of seeing Jason killing the women with a shovel are gone, the scare is in your mind not in your sight. It will never be bettered and doesn't deserve to be. Its like Hitchcock always said. Its not the bang that scares the audience, its the anticipation of it.This film is the breathing metaphor of that statement.",8,1,2,28 January 2000
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," A real let down
","Luckily for me I have not got round to reading the literature upon which this movie is supposedly based on. I say luckily because my opinion on the film would probably have been far more harsh than the one I have at the moment. The problem with the film is that it just doesn't seem to want to do anything for itself. It is more than content with simply letting the camera rove around the spectacular scenery. Don't get me wrong it is breath-taking to watch some beautiful things, but if I wanted to see that  and that only I would watch the discovery channel or holiday programmes.John Madden had promised so much from his recent efforts, and had showed his audience that he was more than capable of handling drama in such a way as to make us care about the characters. However, this just isn't possible. Maybe there is something wrong with the script, because there is so little dialogue that sticks out. Maybe there was some concern from the studio as to the length of the film, it certainly feels as though it has had huge chunks taken away from it, because no studio in the world would let such a shallow piece of writing be made. One almost feels as though the spectacle of the novel and its success may well have been enough to secure money, and a big box office, and so the writing of dialogue took second place to everything else. I mean look at the cast that they were able to secure, Cage, Bale, Hurt, Cruz, four actors whose most recent films have made them A-list quality. It has all the ingredients to be a film remembered and admired.The cast though is, mostly dreadful. Nicolas Cage, who is said to have Italian decendancy is mocking in his performance and although he tries to shape off this loveable nonchalant man, the accent simply makes him look mugging. Penelope Cruz walks around for two hours pouting and refusing to drop the accent which is here forte. Hurt gives a solid performance though and Bale continues to play good supporting roles.The films biggest pratfall though is its confusion to let the audience know what it is actually trying to tell us. There is, what feels like, a love story but why is there love. There is no occasions upon which any chemistry happens, nor incidents which would make two people love each other, only once does he play the mandolin for her. There is also the war story which takes up half of the film and really makes you empathise with Correlis plight but that soon wilts away as the love story comes back. It would have been predictable had the film had any direction, but by never finsihing anything it starts and by leaving the audience asking why it simply fizzles out. Readers of the book will probably say 'its not the book, but it is still brilliant' but the fact is that book or not, it is a badly acted film which is unsure of what it is functioning as love story/ war movie/ moral tale/ national pride. It is unclear and very much a let down.",6,1,2,6 May 2001
American Pie," I'll have another slice
","This is a fim which doesn't try to prove anything except that laughter is very good for the soul.  The writing is slick and although oscars may not be winging their way to the movie, fans will be. Some memorable lines which kids all across the world will be quoting. Little more can be said as there is no structure to the genius. The acting is great particlularly Chris Klein, the running time perfect and the overall mood is sweet. Just like American Pie.",8,0,0,28 January 2000
American Beauty," Movie of a lifetime......
","With all the hype and word of mouth surrounding this movie it would have been very easy to have gone to see it and then said 'It wasn't as good as everyone made out'. The fact is though, that it actually is, and on a personal level, possibly even better than that. What makes the movie so memorable, above the actual film, was the experience and understanding that this movie is about us. Not many movies can boast that but it was a movie that we can all relate to and all empathise with.Look Closer, was the tagline for the movie and that is what is needed to experience this film in its true beauty. As well as the surface material which we see on the screenthere is always so much more going on outside of the action. There is such a continuos motion and speed to the movie that never lets up and this is what life basically is. It keeps going and going and before we know it we have lost so much time. Its the story of an (approaching) middle aged man who realises that he has wasted the last twenty years of his life and so decides that he is going to rectify his mistake and live the way he used to. That is the the story of the central character (Spacey), but what makes this movie so captivating is the numerous subplots which closely link to Spacey and his family. The subplots are not merely drawn in at the beginning of the movie and then resolved at the end. Instead they pop up throughout various stages and then are resolved on a natural timeline. The film cannot be sub-genred, it is far too detailed and unique for it to ever be labelled as a family-drama, or a black-comedy. The thing that the movie most closely represents is a soap-opera. However, should American Beauty and its story be put into a soap it would take a good 4 weeks or so to wrap up everything that happens. That is the films main strength, it does not lose itself amidst the mass of story which is taking place. The action is very sudden and the timescale realistic. Before you know it the end is upon you. The cast is fairly impeccable. Spacey can always be relied upon to give a solid performance, but this is his best work, probably ever. He illuminates off the screen and empowers every scene he is in. They say that the hardest roles to play are normal people and that is where the triumph is. He makes a normal person seem very real. Annette Benning plays off Spacey so well and leaves us wondering whether they are actually married. Chriss Cooper has a small but perfectly acted role and then there are the youngsters. Mena Suvari and Thora Birch play off each other with great naturalism and make their relationship very emotive. Then there is wes Bentley, a relative new-comer but a definite star for the future. His role maybe a close representation of him but the beauty he brings to the film is worth the two hours alone.Look Closer but by all means just look.",10,0,0,5 February 2000
The Mummy Returns," Don't let it return again, please.
","It is a real atrocity that this movie would even be remade but even more of an atrocity that people will actually be flooding to see it. They will for the simple fact that it is big. Big in special effects to the point of overkill, I mean this bad-boy feels just like a computer game. The problem with a lot of computer games is that they don't have a plot, well dito for Mummy Returns.It was evident from the first one that Sommers just hasn't got a clue how to write, I mean there are barely any standout moments of dialogue and the fact that it feels like the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles is a bad thing. It feels like an infant has pencilled a few odd words and the whole thing has been jumbled around and strectched into a screenplay. There is simply no struture to the script, not plotting devices, no moments of dramatic tension and no reason for anything that does happen, to actually happen.The film is bad to worse material. The ever reliable Brendan Frazer is, as ever, reliable. Weisz is OK but Hannah does a risible effort at comedy. There is no point in billing the rock up as he is blink and you'll miss him material. It is a crying shame that so much money should be heaped into such a lame and contrived piece of writing. Fear not though as it is not only writing which is haphazard but the direction itself. Whenever there seems to be some sort of motion to the piece there is an unneeded 10 minutes of slow silent nothingness.I cannot help but be subjective because the objective opinion would probably make people feel as though this is a decent movie. After all special effects is the only two words which people need to be sold on a movie.",5,0,0,21 May 2001
Toy Story 2," Childrens film for adults alike
","The greatness and superiority of Disney is very obvious when watching a movie which has as much class as Toy Story 2. Everyone has seen the first film and opinion was that it couldn't really be stretched and that what made it so good was the novelty. It was a good movie, but good because it surprised the audience with the technology. Things are different in No.2. John Lassetter has made a movie which can rank alongside any other great movie seen in the last 100 years. There is still the cleverness which can be expressed by saying 'this was done on computer' but ahead of all of that is a great childrens story with enough humour and class about it to impress adults as well. I will not discuss the premise as it is hardly Sherlock Holmes, but I will tell you assuredly that for 75% of this movie you will have a smile on your face and a laugh in your belly. They have definetely moved things along a little with the technology as well, so much so that human characters look real and halfway through the film you could swear that the toys are as well. The script is very clever and has similar brilliant one-liners as the first. this truly is the future. Actors who don't need 20 million a movie. Crew working for their art. And a movie which is out to, very simply, entertain. Toy Story 2 cannot be bettered as a movie, and though a better film will come along, this will always rank as a major point in the history of cinema, bigger than the first.",9,0,1,19 February 2000
There's Something About Mary," A love it or hate it movie........
","Thats the way the world is unfortunately. There are two types of people those who love movies like this beacuse they are very funny and those who don't because they have a manner which means they have to look for problems wherever they look (Read politicians, minority groups). There really is no need to go and see a movie like this if you want to come out and complain. You've seen their previous movies, don't buy a ticket. The deal with the Farrellys is that they understand that if something is funny then it should be laughed at. Someone falls over, laugh. Don't go and help him up. Mary has the ability to make the viewer laugh. More than once and more frequently than not. In my opinion that makes a comedy a good comedy. I truly believe that you stick any old actors into brilliant material and situations as are in mary then you will laugh. That being said though the ensemble really do pull together and play off each other to startling effect and even the Farrelly regulars have some great moments. Lee Evans in particular has broken America and looks to have a bright future ahead of him in film. Stiller is Stellar and Diaz a bombshell once more. Even Matt Dillon proves 'I can do comedy'.",7,0,0,28 January 2000
The Matrix," The first twenty-first century movie....
","The diversity of the brothers Wachowski is quite incredible. Almost trying to prove that it takes no talent to make the same film over and over again (Spielberg?). They go from Bound to this. Bound being a lesbian film-noir, Matrix being a movie which is sure to be imitated as we go technology crazy in the C21. Putting Keanu in a high budget, special-effects laden vision of the future (or the present) may have seemed like a big gamble. Keanu had been making stinkers for a long time and had yet proved he had a real talent or box-office pull. Yet they have placed him in position of what must have been a hard fought for role. Then having seen Keanu as Neo, it is impossible to imagine anyone else being the computer nerd of the future. It may not be a real role of emotional stretch but these are often the hardest ones to bring life to. Keanu manages it and has also cemented his place on the Hollywood A-List.It is an action movie, for sure. Let that not distract you though. The action is there and also the possibility that effects can over-shadow the ability this movie has to affect. A vision of the vision as bleak as this has been shown before but this movie really does give you the potential to believe that we are already living the future.The plot may be a little confusing but the pace of the adventure doesn't try to throw the plot out the window. For effects fans, as well as entertainment seekers alike this movie tells us that the future of Keanu as well as the Brothers Wachowski is very bright indeed.",8,0,0,28 January 2000
