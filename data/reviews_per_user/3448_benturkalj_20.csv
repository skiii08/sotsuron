Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Great ending to a brilliant epic
","Kill Bill Vol 2. is an awesome conclusion to a great movie double. If you liked the first one, you should definitely get a kick out of seeing the remaining members of the viper squad killed.This is more like a Tarantino of old, and has all of the witty dialog we have come to expect from the modern master. There's a great deal of it to, but that is not to say that there aren't any great fights in this. If anything, the battles are just as enjoyable here, though they are certainly more concise.Everything about this film is fantastic. The acting is great from everyone, particularly Madsen and Carradine. The characters have a load of depth, much more then the first part, and even the lesser known characters will be remembered. The score is up to the usual high standard, with some really cool references to some other classic films by a certain Western Director.If you are able, it is best to watch the two flicks back to back: both are easily some of the best to come out in modern times. An instant classic.",10,6,10,7 October 2005
Mission: Impossible III," Reasonable effort, but still forgettable
","Mission Impossible three offers a reasonable number of thrills, some great acting from Phillip Seymour Hoffman as usual, a lot of ridiculous running sequences from Tom Cruise, and is fairly fun.Plotwise, it follows the same conventions pretty much of the second flick: There's an issue with something in the wrong Hands, and a team has to save the day. It offers a fairly decent amount of cool stunts, with some clear references to 'True Lies' and 'Speed'. Strangely though, it was not really the action sequences that I enjoyed the most in this film: any part with Hoffman in it was simply awesome to watch. I really think he carried the movie with his abiities to play a cold blooded killer, though it was a real shame that we didn't see more of it.Sadly, the film is mostly let down by a ridiculous love story angle, and way too many scenes involving Tom Cruise running like a maniac, but it was still decent entertainment.I still put this on a par with the second film, and the original definitely wins out over this one because it's sense of suspense. See it for fun, but don't expect too much.",6,0,0,18 May 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Adventure film making at it's best
","If you were to watch only one adventure film in your lifetime, then this is it. Big call I know, but this really is the best Spielberg has given us.And what a thrilling ride it is. From the opening set piece involving the lead stealing an idol from a rain forest, which is an absolute corker, to the amazing finale, this is a non-stop action bonanza that never gets tired.The characters are also a lot of fun, with Harrision Ford playing the Wise-cracking archaeologist much like his his most renowned role, and his just as capable girlfriend being the highlights.As always, John William's creates an instantly recognizable score to match the visuals, resulting in a package that always entertains. Truly fantastic stuff that makes other attempts at the genre look useless.",10,0,1,30 September 2005
Spartacus," Makes Gladiator look like garbage
","Okay, I know a lot of people love Gladiator, and I guess it wasn't that bad, but it was still just a dumb action movie. it also pales in comparison to Spartacus, the original fight in the Colosseum flick. What differs is that it is just so much more interesting, with a great story about a man who tries to fight against the Romans and regain his peoples dignity.There are a number of notable pieces of brilliance that make this such a great film, especially for it's time. Firstly, the script is full of great dialog, and offers some fantastic lines for the Romans. It is the first film to include a Gay scene, though it is done with clever subtlety. And it was one of the first big epics to end in a downer. Yep, that's right!! Goes against what most people want in a big screen epic but it was done well!! There's plenty more to recommend it, but I think it is best just to say it is one of the finest films ever made and well worth watching if you want a film with some brains, as well as epic action.",10,4,10,12 October 2005
Casablanca," Simply special
","Casablanca is quite simply one of the most enjoyable films you are likely to see, for so many reasons. It is a film has just about everything you could want, with great romance, suspense and drama. The acting is superb from all those involved, though the absolute cool of Humphrey Bogart and the sheer beauty of Ingmar Bergman working together is probably a highlight.But more then anything, it is the incredible script that really needs to be mentioned. I have yet to see a film that can maintain the level of satisfaction from the barrage of instantly classic one-liners that's offered here, and there is such a wide variety of fantastic characters that make this such a gem.If you want to see a 40's film that really shows the quality of the work during that time, then Casablanca is the perfect place to start.",10,2,4,28 September 2005
Citizen Kane," A great film for many reasons
","When it comes to film, everyone should know about this one, as it is often hailed as 'the greatest movie of all time'. Although this is definitely an exaggeration, it is still a great film with a variety of elements contributing to it's whole.From a technical perspective it is outstanding. The use of focus and the blitzing displays of multiple images are a true testament to the cinematographer, and was something you would rarely see in those times.It really helps as well that a fantastic script is used here to show an interesting take on the great American dream, and the acting is also top class. The only real issues with this film is perhaps that it is bit too obvious in it's messages, but this is negligible considering how impressive the film is overall. Definitely a must see.",9,2,4,30 September 2005
Full Metal Jacket," The best Vietnam movie
","I know it is certainly a big call to call this the best Vietnam movie of all time, but this is probably the most realistic account of it. It is also a great example of Director Kubrick's ability to show humans objectively, not trying to make out whether one is evil or not.Essentially the movie is divided into two parts. The first revolves around the training of marines, and shows the brutality of becoming a soldier. The second part then focuses on the actual battlefield.What is interesting about this film is that it isn't particularly violent, but still extremely powerful. This is about the psychology of War, about how various soldiers deal with a mad mad situation, and it does a great job of depicting this.Everything about this film is great. The acting is top notch from a cast of mostly unknowns, and the score is used to haunting effect. Camera shots also brilliantly portray the scenes, often from the point of view of the person shooting, to great effect. And if anything can be said to recommend this film, it is that there many great scenes that you will definitely never forget. A masterpiece.",10,8,14,5 October 2005
Romeo + Juliet," The way Shakespeare should be viewed
","When Baz Lurman decided to make a Shakespeare movie, he wanted to recreate the experience as it was in it's day, or in other words make it fun again. And that's just what he achieved with this well conceived drama.Set in Venice beach instead of the original Venice, Italy, all of the dialog is kept with some clever referencing used to help thread some of the problems into the story.Using a great sense of style, the film generally moves at a thrilling pace, with sometimes bizarre use of the camera making for an exceptional visual experience. All of the acting is well above standard, with kudos to Leonardo Decaprio and Clare Danes, though everyone does a top class job.The score is also top notch, taking some of the best bands and using them effectively to help create the right mood. If your a purist, you may dislike this quirky film, but if you want to see Shakespeare in an exciting portrayal, then this is well worth seeing.",10,0,1,31 October 2005
The Shining," The mother of all horror films
","Stanley Kubrick was probably the most most consistently brilliant director in film history. Despite having made films in a variety of genres, there has rarely been one made that is short of classic status, and his foray into horror is quite possibly the best of it's kind.In 'The Shining', we are basically told a small story about writer's block, in which a writer and his family look after a hotel during the winter. With no one staying there, they are completely isolated, and writer Jack, (Jack Nicholson), finds himself slowly going mad, eventually resulting in his attempted murder of his wife and child.Kubrick was always about phychology, and he expertly creates a deeply disturbing atmosphere which slowly builds. the camera-work helps to show the vast space the family are stuck in, and the haunting soundtrack compliments this extremely well, creating plenty of tension. The acting is also about as good as it gets from everyone, though it has to be said that Jack Nicholson steals the show as the lunatic star. Overall, this is my favourite horror flick, a film that manages to grip you to the very end, and it has to be said that even the most hardened movie goers will get some chills from this masterpiece.",10,1,2,10 January 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Actually pretty exciting, if you can get past the comic stuff
","OK, so a lot of reviewers are saying that this was pretty sub-standard. In my own view, I would say that it pretty much succeeds in achieving what it aims to do, and I would definitely watch a sequel to it.Ratner definitely will annoy some comic fans for sure: there are some pretty big deaths that you have to wonder about. I also probably didn't like the way the Phoenix saga was handled here either, but it's not all about comics.In the end, at least for the most part, everything is well done. The dialogs was fine, and probably better then the other films in some ways. The film never dragged, the effects were well done, and the storyline was reasonably well established.It certainly could have been done a lot better, but enjoyed this a great deal more then some of the other blockbusters out recently. This is a worthy sequel, so don't hesitate to check it out.",7,1,2,29 May 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," a movie lovers dream
","In the past, I've refused to rate a film as my favorite, but I have now come to realise that this great work is about as entertaining as it gets.Kill Bill Vol.1 is Quentin's most accomplished film by miles, perfectly melding together thousands of references from past masterpieces to create a post-modern epic worthy of great praise.After about literally at least ten viewings, it still amazes me how visually stunning it is, seemingly never relenting from it's attack on the senses. Great soundtrack, great visuals,great pace: It's almost like a generation x Sergio Leone film. If blood doesn't scare you, please watch this, as it won't disappoint.",10,1,3,18 August 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Kaufman does it again
","When people think of a film, there is always an immediate assumption that the director is the key force that should be rewarded, or the actors. It is a shame that people forget about the script writers, because Charlie Kaufmans pedigree has resulted in some of the most original and satisfying films that have ever been made, and done so in less then a decade. This is one of them.Imaging a future were a person can have their memories of something they don't like erased, it follows the path of a man who hopes to forget his ex girlfriend. As he slowly goes through the process, he finds himself trying to hang on to them. This is an incredibly deep film which has many dark themes involved, but it is also incredibly moving.The visuals are certainly well used, and the acting is of the highest quality from all involved, though the leads are outstanding. If there anything to say to deter people, it is that is a very sad film for the most part, but it is hard to deny that it is still a work of art that represents Kaufman at the peak of his powers. Amazing.",10,2,6,30 September 2005
Mission: Impossible," Very clever thriller
","For those who have not seen the original Mission Impossible, it is a real shame. While the other flicks offer plenty of explosions and cool action sequences, the original remains the best for it's interesting plot twists, some decent acting, and a well developed element of suspense that's lacking in the later pictures.To reveal any of the plot would be a disservice: it certainly has some pretty interesting occurrences that should be seen for full effect. What really makes this great though is De Palma's direction. Unlike the later flicks, key scenes are drawn out: there is a real Spense of suspense that is rarely achieved. Three key action scenes come to mind, and there all extremely cool: it's just a shame that Criuse couldn't enlist the services of more experienced director's later in the franchise.A memorable, well executed thriller.",8,55,69,18 May 2006
A Beautiful Mind," A well crafted fiction
","It has to be said that this would have been okay if it wasn't a patronizing fiction about schizophrenia. Sadly, Ron Howard has made a film which is a complete bastardization of the real story of John Nash.Let's forget that Nash's form of the mental illness was merely misinterpreting radio messages, as opposed to having 'imaginary' car chases from secret agents. Forget that he actually was quite good with women, having numerous relationships with them, as well as men. Let's even forget that the man was actually divorced from his wife, whilst also being a brilliant scientist with numerous accomplishments, and you might enjoy this film. Of course, that would take away the whole point of it being a 'true story'. Just remember that you are watching make-believe.",2,6,13,3 October 2005
All Quiet on the Western Front," Still an amazing effort
","Considering that this film was made in 1930, it is a remarkable achievement that a film with such a powerful message was allowed to see the light of day, especially considering the circumstances.Centering on the first World War from a German perspective, it is a story about a group of teenagers who are recruited to join the army. At first, they see it as a great honour and something of an adventure, but as they all face the brutal realities of War, they are soon left disillusioned. When the main character returns home from service and shows his hatred of War, he finds his own compatriots now hate him, and decides to return to the battlefields were he dies, now a mess.Viewing it from a modern perspective, I was quite amazed by the many messages this film had, and the sad truth that they are even more relevant today in some respects. Everything flows extremely well, the acting is superb and overall this much more powerful then most of the modern movies that exist today about War. This is a remarkable achievement that everyone should see. Brilliant.",10,4,6,28 September 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Well, it could have been a lot worse...
","For anyone who wasn't living under a rock when this came out, you would probably have gotten the idea that this was the star Wars everyone was hoping for. There are certainly a great deal to recommend viewing it.The special effects sequences are extremely well executed, though probably a bit over abundant, and the John William's score is an amazing blend of nostalgia and new material. If you are a Star Wars fan, it cannot be denied that you will enjoy seeing the characters you know and love from previous films becoming what you know they will have to. I certainly loved the epic scale of seeing the Evil Empire come into fruition, even if it had to use the now common clique of referring to our troubling times, particularly an American President.However, that's not to say that George Lucas has redeemed himself completely. Dialouge is certainly better, but not that much. There's a particular scene that makes me cringe, but it's certainly not the actors fault. If anything, the film manages to make up for dialouge through it's disregard of actors, who are definitely second fiddle to the effects in this one. George Lucas is still a bad director in my books, but the characters and the effects still make this a worthwhile flick to view.",8,2,5,28 September 2005
Amélie," Such imaginative fun!!
","Every now and then a film comes that leaves you with complete satisfaction, and this a rare classic. Seriously, this is easily one of the best crafted films to come out in the new Milena, simply because it is so perfectly enjoyable. It's so hard not to like, the way it shows the importance of the little things in life, and with that awesome visual style that Jean Peunet has become so good at. This has just so many great scenes, as well as some really heart wrenching parts and some fantastic characters. And it's also a great start for those who haven't seen any cool french flicks.This is a top ten film, so see it!!",10,0,3,5 October 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Sorry again...
","Okay, this is a pretty good movie, but I just find it hard to see it in the top five, thus the low score.Although it certainly has a lot of great things about it, there is a great deal wrong with it as well, which I suppose must be expected from a film that is trying to condense 500 pages of literature into over three hours. It must first be said that this clearly too long, or at least there are points in the film were it does seem to lumber along. It also seems that Jackson's choice in which parts of the film were to remain in the final cut left out a great deal of interesting stories from the books, and the ending is completely different to that of the book and unnecessary.That said, it is still an incredible achievement overall, with excellent battle scenes and amazing effects surrounding an already lovable story, but I still wish Jackson had made more use of the characters. It's a great film to watch for sure, much better then a lot of the stuff were seeing now, but it still could have been a great deal better.",1,5,29,28 September 2005
Sin City," Sins have never looked so cool
","Okay, I think we have a winner! In the past, we've a great deal of comic based films which have generally followed a familiar formula: Hero saves city from bad monstrous freak. Though I have generally enjoyed most entries into this genre, I have to say that few have really tried to push the boundaries of cinema.With Sin City, based on Frank Miller's graphic novel's, we have given something stylistically different to anything before it, a dark as anything 50's world were nothing is right, and the 'heroes' are always severely flawed in some way.I personally loved everything about it. The look of the film, almost entirely made up in digital, creates an atmosphere unlike anything you will see in other films. The dialog, though certainly not 'mainstream', offers a great throwback to another time when one-liner's and narrative's were king. The characters, many of whom you will love, would be despicable in another world, but here they are as unique as the world miller has created, and are made to be cared about.Despite some claims that it moves at lightning pace, there are times when it is slow up a bit. It cannot be understated that the film is incredibly gruesome in parts as well, though not overly gratuitous in it's attack on the senses. However, if your after something that's a little different for a change and can handle the gore, then check it out!!! You won't be disappointed.",9,0,1,9 August 2005
Beetlejuice," Where it all started
","Tim Burton is one heck of a director. He's made the best comic book film there ever was with 'Batman', and some of the most memorable films of our time. This was his real breakthrough, a warped comedy that provides a unique world that only Burton can give.The concept is odd to say the least. A happily married couple have a car accident and die. Now ghosts, they try to rid their home of what they consider some pretty obnoxious neighbors, with the help of an 'expert' called 'Bettlejuice'.Surprisingly, it all works splendidly. Burton's world is unique and vivid, with some truly imaginative stuff going on. Michael Keaton, who plays the title role, is absolutely hilarious. He really is an underrated actor, who is damn funny when he wants to be.Considering the subject matter, it's amazing that Burton's world is still so light-hearted and interesting, but he pulls it off with a great sense of style and humor. If you want to see something completely different that's accessible, then do yourself a favor and check it out.",9,1,2,7 October 2005
