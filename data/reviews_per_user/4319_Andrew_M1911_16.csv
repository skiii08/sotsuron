Iron Man 3," Listen....
",This movie gets a lot of backlash for stupid things. People didn't like the change to the Mandirin. He was corny in the comics and would feel out of place in this movie. To be honest I would of really wanted him to be a terriost and be pure evil and such but I will gladly take this fake out over the comic book version. This movie is dope though. Iron Man pulser beams a guy straight through the chest he kills a person technically with a microwave and Tony's character is expanded on in this film showing that he has PTSD from the previous films.,8,1,3,1 November 2018
It," One of my Favorites
",This is my favorite horror movie ever! The story is excellent and Bill (Most definitely not about to butcher his last name) is fantastic as Pennywise. There is only one thing that I have a problem with and that is the fact that this movie is pretty reliant on jump scares and CGI. Hopefully this is improved in the sequel.,10,1,2,19 September 2018
Spider-Man 3," Great
",This movie does have stupid moments (you already know) but watching this movie is a lot of fun and the CGI is fantastic better than most movies today.,7,1,1,19 September 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," It would have been lower....
","I really enjoyed this movie I did but, goddammit the CGi is not on point. It's just the main suit looks weird and it's not realistic. In such a good movie it stands out.",9,0,0,17 December 2018
Alien," Phenomenal.
","What else is there to say about this masterpiece of movie? I mean there is great effects, dope set design, blood, and my favorite protagonist of a horror movie ever.",10,2,3,5 August 2019
Interstellar," Long.
",Don't get me wrong the movie is good but it's pretty stretched out. The movie can also be boring at some points and the ending is well you probably know. The visual effects are fantastic and the twist is pretty good.,9,0,0,1 November 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," Underrated
",This movie is actually really good. Steve Rogers is a small guy and wants to enlist in the army. (Btw the CGI on Chris Evans and the other guy is great) he becomes a hero and experiences war and it's action packed and even at some points violent. This movie is one of the only marvel movie before 2012 to feature bullet wounds and effects such as the scene were Steve uses a car door as a shield and gets grazed through the door. The only problem is that there is a huge montage in the middle that seems out of place. But the ending gives me chills every time. I won't spoil it so you got to watch it. The relationship between Peggy and Steve is fantastic and Howard Stark is hilarious and feels like Tony.,9,0,1,1 November 2018
Oblivion," It's good
",The movie is pretty good and visually stunning but I think at least 10 minutes could have been shaved off.,7,1,2,10 November 2018
The Shining," It is a Classic.
","After seeing the Shining and it's sequel I have determined that this film is still great but, there is one glaring problem for me. The pacing in the first half is extremely slow. I believe this movie is 4 minutes shorter but I thought this was longer than its sequel. I get that the exposition has to be laid out but it really takes it out of me for the first 45 minutes. Although the second half blows the first half and most movies out of the water showing us that Jack is going insane and that hotel is the puppet master with little hints dropped here and their. That's what I like about this film more than the one that proceeds it. It isn't fully clear what is making the house haunted in a sense but that it just is. I like that it is not all in your face about it being haunted or that Jack is just a crazy person. Also, this movie has one of my favorite endings and it took me forever to understand.",8,1,1,28 December 2019
Captain America: Civil War," One of the best Marvel movies!
",Most impressive movie Marvel has released! Just about everything is important besides Zimo's plan and the Sokovia accords but action electrifying and the story is great.,10,0,1,19 September 2018
Django Unchained," Quentin's Finest
",This movie is a long fun ride. This movie could go on for days and I would sit through all of it.,10,2,6,10 November 2018
The Hurt Locker," I gotta explain....
","This movie is good. I want to start with that because I do like this movie but that doesn't mean it is without flaws. This movie is inaccurate and even sometimes unrealistic but most of my criticism is just nitpicking except for the military inaccuracies (mainly with his clothing) and I don't like the ending. This movie is good though. The tension building is perfect and filming in Jordan was a really good idea, not safe but good. Although this movie isn't poorly shot it doesn't have anything that stands out to me as far as cinematography. That's just me. It's a great film and I recommend it to just about everyone.",9,1,1,5 August 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Goddamn it.....
",The did so well on the first movie how did you screw this up?! All you had to do was be like 'What did they like from the first movie and what they didn't like.' It shouldn't be his difficult to make a Spider-Man movie. There is so much wrong with this movie. Why did Peter not know who Oscorp was but secretly knew the heir since childhood? Why are you so damn fixated on Peter's parents even though everyone likes the concept of this can happen to anyone? Why are you making Spider-Man 3 look like The Godfather of spiderman's? Why is it so hard to make a Spider-Man movie?,2,0,2,17 December 2018
Once Upon a Time in America," It's Good but....
",Don't get me wrong the movie is well written however the obvious problem is it's unbearable runtime. This isn't even the longest version. After 3 hours and 49 minutes I hadn't made up my mind. First it was 10 stars and then it was 7 and now it's 5. The movie isn't good on a rewatch and the pacing is incredibly slow with some scenes stay way past their welcome. However the acting is indeed great and the story itself is well written.,8,1,2,28 December 2019
Iron Man," You will be missed.....
",This movie is such a national treasure. I miss the old practical suits and the days of not having disgusting CGI on everything. Don't get me wrong it's helpful but they are way too reliant on it.,10,0,0,17 December 2018
Gladiator," Phenomenal!
","This movie is a masterpiece with just about everything in it. The acting, especially from Our protagonist and antagonist. The action with gladiators and the war is breathtaking. It's only flaw is the runtime. The first quarter after the battle scene seems to drag on as the pace slows down however it recovers as the rest of the movie is excellent.",10,1,2,28 December 2019
