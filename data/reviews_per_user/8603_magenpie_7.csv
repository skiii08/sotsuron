Minority Report," Stunningly disappointing
","If we could see ourselves coming out from watching films like this, would we ever go to watch them in the first place? And what would happen to the film industry then?There are interesting philosophical and moral paradoxes arising from using a prediction of the future to change that future, but given the average audience's intelligence and attention span, it was probably wise (if disappointing for some of us) of Spielberg to steer clear of them and instead present yet another rather tedious variation on the theme of 'the system's not the problem, the people running it are'. (Hollywood loves to do this comfort-food-for-the-soul stuff: if things aren't going your way, it's not tough, it's not because that's the way things are, it's because somebody out there doesn't like you and there *is* something you can do about it. (Well, usually; sometimes it tries its luck with 'the system is the problem, try to smash the system, oh dear you can't, that's tough', as for example in 'Falling Down' which worked so well you wonder why it doesn't try it more often.))So once again we are led down the familiar twisty-turny route where the good guy is the bad guy only he's not really because he's trying to find the real bad guy and the bad guy isn't really bad he's just doing what the other bad guy told him to and the guy in the middle is just your average Joe with good and bad bits but then I suppose that's true too of the good guy and the bad guy... in the end your head spins at the casual unpredictability of just about anyone with any independence left in them. (Well, any *man*: the Madonna Syndrome is positively *flourishing* here. (No, not *that* Madonna!))Fighting to keep on the path of Controlled Narrative Unravelment is that Everyman-wannabe Tom Cruise. Since we're in Philip K. Dick territory, the inevitable comparison with Harrison Ford in 'Blade Runner' only serves to show how implausible Cruise is as the flawed cop fighting to solve the mystery of the apparently equally flawed system. He has neither the gravitas to carry the righteousness nor the rough edges to carry the imperfections (even with those slightly crooked teeth, which even as I write he's having straightened - more's the pity), whereas Ford had both in bucketloads. Cruise in ten years' time? That could be a different story.So, an unoriginal plot (and one with more holes in than a pair of fishnet stockings) and a poorly chosen central cast member. Any redeeming features? The special effects are certainly impressive (and so they should be judging by the credits: screenful after screenful of hard-pressed behind-the-scenes mouse wranglers, with the not inconsiderable list of actors tacked on at the end): if you're fond of spiders, you'll love the sleek cuties here; if not, you may never feel safe in the bath again! As for messy organ transplants... yuk, 'nuff said. Meanwhile the prosthetics people had fun with a face mask that could have been a recycled reject from 'The Elephant Man'. Did they really mean to make Cruise turn briefly into a cross between Leonard Nimoy and Leonard Rossiter? I don't think so, but it gave me and my companion some light relief.Neither as thought-provoking as 'A.I.' nor as much fun as 'Mission: Impossible'. I have seen the future, and it doesn't involve my watching this film again. 5/10.",Null,0,0,1 August 2002
The Others," Clever, chilling, provocative.
","Oooooh, scary movie? Well, not in the vein of, say, 'Carrie' or 'Halloween'. (Scary gore-fests are a bit pass√©, aren't they?) No, this is an intelligent ghost story. The premise is not an original idea, but it's extremely well presented. Nicole Kidman turns in another effortless excellent performance without outshining her fellow actors, so we also get the full benefit of the fine contributions from unknowns (at least to me) Fionnula Flanagan as the housekeeper and Alakina Mann and James Bentley as Kidman's character's children. After seeing the faithful -but-tedious 'Potty Harry', it's very refreshing to see child actors doing their job really convincingly and movingly. Meanwhile Eric Sykes as the gardener brings just the right combination of gravitas and 'Ho ho, I know what's going on and you don't'.The direction is mostly subtly effective, and very occasionally not-so-subtly effective, in particular during the 'Oh so *that's* what's going on' pharyngoedema[1]-inducing scene near the end.Most of the time this film rolls along nicely at 8/10, but it briefly hits 10/10 with the afore-mentioned revelatory scene so I'm prepared to overlook the utter implausiblity of the premise and give it 8.5/10. Not an absolute must-see but definitely a pleasure to have watched it.[1]: a made-up term meaning approximately 'lump-in-the-throat'",Null,1,2,13 December 2001
"Monsters, Inc."," Undemanding, entertaining, laugh-a-minute stuff. Go see!
","I love those nature programmes that take you to the depths of the ocean and show you a myriad life-forms that bear little resemblance either to one another or to anything familiar. Apparently the folk at Pixar do too. But a clever computer-graphical interpretation of Mother Nature's sweet little imagination wouldn't make for much of an entertaining time. Fortunately this film also has wit, slapstick, pathos and adventure in just the right proportions. I laughed, I cried, I was amused by the homage to Ray Harryhausen and the nods to Star Wars, James Bond, Mission Impossible, Toy Story, The Wrong Trousers, Reservoir Dogs (yes really!) not to mention the many more that I probably missed by blinking or not paying attention (Fargo, apparently, for example). Overall, a romping hoot from start to finish, not in the least let down by the straightforward see-it-a-mile-off plot. If only humans could act that well. 9/10.P.S. Why was The Abominable Snowman using a crate of lingonberries (tautologically labelled 'Swedish lingonberries') as a seat? A seemingly pointless choice, albeit an amusing one. Is there an influential Swede working at Pixar? Hmmm...",Null,0,0,5 April 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Good Start; let the waiting for parts II and III begin!
","'One film to lure them all, one film to woo them, One film to bring them all and in the darkness glue them.'Well, maybe...I found it pretty well impossible to think about this film without considering the book.If you've read it recently enough to remember it, then you'll probably find the film an almost entirely satisfactory rendering of Tolkien's flat, detailed, humourless, occasionally superficial narrative prose style (there were a few little muckings-about, cuts and additions but these were mostly harmless). But as with Potty Harry, you might still think (as I did) that a film should be a lot more than merely a cinematographic rendering of a linear sequence of words; then again you might think that suitable homage has been paid to a book that brought the idea of the mythic epic narrative form back into the mainstream (thereby unfortunately spawning an orc-ish horde of poor imitations that didn't bother with Tolkien's attention to sub-structure; remember that The Lord Of The Rings was just skimming the surface of the complete mythology that The Silmarillion revealed more of).If you haven't read the book but the idea of 'a mixed bunch of adventurers who don't really like one another but have An Important Mission to carry out' appeals to you then you'll probably enjoy Our Heroes' struggle against overtly Evil forces and covertly Disruptive influences; you might even find the brief nod to 'Back To The Future' amusing rather than cheesy and pointless.If you haven't read the book and you don't fancy the film, then ask yourself this: did you like Star Wars? Because if George Lucas didn't find inspiration in the likes of Tolkien then I'll eat my light sabre.Regardless of where you're coming from, it's certainly a visual feast. Spectacular computer animation plus the lovely New Zealand scenery (not been there? Go!) mostly managed not to distract from some fine acting and excellent costumery. (I said *some*; the ubiquitous Cate Blanchett got a bum deal here: looking soulful and sad didn't really capture Galadriel's sense of impending loss of her own power, but perhaps the fault lay more with the dialogue and direction at this point.)Oh, you want a rating? Sorry, you'll have to wait a couple of years until I've seen all the installments. It's all based on one big book really; practical considerations of time and economy are what have split it into three films.",Null,0,0,5 April 2002
Men in Black II," A great big stinking pile of crud
","Who let *this* dog out?'Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry, this could be a case for Mulder and Scully'... er, well, no, not really. The Man-and-Woman in Black would be falling about at the inanity of it all. Just what is this film about? It's not entertainment, that's for sure. Seems like it's just a simple-minded exercising of the power of modern computer graphics. And cynical money-making. 'Men in Black did really well.' 'Yeah, and I've got this great new software.' 'Ok then, looks like we got ourselves another train full of gravy!'The first fifteen minutes give it away, really. There's barely an original thought on show; instead we get images and ideas ripped off from Lexx, Buffy, Mission: Impossible, The X-Files, Doctor Who, Buffy again, ... and those were the just ones I noticed - not being a great sci-fi or action movie buff, who knows what others I missed?The acting (if I dare call it that) seems to have been inspired by watching too many cardboard cut-outs standing outside small shops advertising this week's special offer. To call it two-dimensional would be an insult to Flatlanders. Will Smith coasts through apparently thinking 'Hey, you saw me in Men in Black and you liked what you saw; just try to remember the good times we had back then'; Tommy Lee Jones seems to have decided that simply looking confused most of the time will do; Rosario Dawson pouts beautifully but with her physiognomy that really isn't a struggle. Various hangers-on come on strong like cast-offs from Star Trek - hey guys, just because you're in a stupid costume and we can't see your face (or in one unfortunate case we can see your face twice) doesn't mean you can get away with simply lumbering from A to B and lunging wildly when you get there. Rip Torn obviously said something unpleasant to someone in the make-up department, for why else would he be half-submerged behind that ridiculous face-fungus? Finally (in the humanoid department) Lara Flynn Boyle as the naughty alien chasing its particular Holy Grail and blowing up/slicing in two/eating anyone in its way is neither nasty, cunning or funny enough.As for the non-humanoids... hey, a talking dog, with att-i-tuuuude, now *that's* a sure-fire winner. Hmmm, how can I put this? *Oh* *no* *it's* *not!* This one's not clever, it's not original, it's not funny. Especially when it serves absolutely no plot purpose whatsoever. The same goes for those stupid wormy things. Whatever happened to respect for the audience's intelligence?Normally I rate films out of 10 but this one doesn't deserve the extra neuron-firing. Alas, if the viewing I went to is anything to go by, it's going to make more than enough money to lure the producers into making a third installment. May I plead with the aliens already living their undercover lives on our humble planet: please, take over Hollywood before it's too late!",Null,0,0,19 August 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Faithful to the book, but a movie needs to be a lot more than that!
","A.K.A 'Harrison Potter and The Philosopher's Chocolate Easter Egg'.You know those big Easter Eggs that come in a splendid box and look magic but are full of almost nothing, or at least contents that disappoint after the big build-up? Well that's what this film was like, a huge triumph of style and presentation over content. Yes, the sets were great, the set pieces wonderful (the Quidditch match was everything I had hoped for), the costumes cheesily perfect, but the direction was lousy and the acting was hammy with excruciating accents (adults) or wooden (children) with the exception of Emma Watson as Hermione who is my current pick for Star In The Making. The soundtrack was deafening sometimes too. And am I the only person who feels a little uncomfortable hearing an 11-year-old say 'Bloody hell'? (Was that in the book?) Still, despite all that, it was mildly entertaining, even if it did seem like Star Wars meets Indiana Jones from time to time. It was also (mostly) gratifying faithful to the book.7/10. I just hope the sequel(s) is/are better acted.",Null,0,0,13 December 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Don't look now. Don't think now. Trust no-one.
","First things first: this is clearly *not* a biopic of John Nash. So what's the story, you ask? Isn't it about the ironic combination of genius and schizophrenia? Well no, not really. Rather, it *uses* that combination to illustrate the real story, which is an allegory about those Great American Topics, conspiracy theory and The Cold War. (As such, it's entitled not to bother mentioning certain politically incorrect aspects of his personality such as his (claimed) anti-Semitism and bisexuality, so I think the critics who have been panning it for misrepresentation are missing the point.)So, does it paint a convincing picture? Yes, undeniably. We're swept right into Nash's view of the world. Solid performances from Russell Crowe and Ed Harris with reliable occasional support from Paul Bettany and Christopher Plummer help a lot here, and although Jennifer Connelly's cardboard cut-out devoted wife doesn't add any dramatic punch, I think we can blame the scriptwriter for that. The hard maths behind Nash's early burst of genius is skipped right over, alas, but then those Hollywood folks never did care much for science and logic. (Is maths science? I can't answer that and I *am* (or was) a mathematician.)8/10. But a Best Actor Oscar nomination? Crowe is good here, but not *that* good. Is the competition really that poor?(P.S. I wrote that just before the Oscars. Well I was right in the end, wasn't I? But I was wrong too, about Connelly. Oh pleeeease. Good looks do not a good performance make. What a travesty.)",Null,0,1,25 March 2002
