The Blair Witch Project," I have never witnessed a more elaborated scam.
","This must be the biggest success ever according to me. I am certain that The Blair Witch Project is in fact a marketing test. Thought out carefully by some brilliant marketing manager who has made a bet amongst his friends that he could market anything with his skills.They gave him the impossible mission. Market a lousy, boring, independent movie made over an week-end by some collage friends. This marketing genius sat many long nights thinking about how this would be done. Then it came clear to him... HYPE, hype the movie on the net. Start with some false rumors about how great this movie really is over the Internet and take it from there.Obviously this worked far over all expectations. The movie became a super hit, almost as big as a Blockbuster and with only a 60 000 dollar budget. This movie really is something special, I have never seen a worse movie. And I have seen a lot of bad movies. The thing that bothers me the most is that people keep falling for the HYPE saying that it is so scary and well thought out. It is noting scary about Blair Witch except the HYPE. I can only draw comparison to Germany 1939. Everyone there fell for the HYPE.This really shows only one thing. It could happen again.Blair Witch is shot with a first person view through out the whole movie. It is shaky camera work, lousy acting, bad script and a boring result. The only persons that can be afraid of this movie must be 12 years old and never been out in the forest or in the cinema. The last 30 seconds of the movie have some excitement but that is all... and last time I checked that was not enough... but hey... maybe that changed too.All the people that comes out from the cinema saying that they enjoyed the movie must have watched it with their eyes wide shut. Wake-up and smell the coffee. You have watch the HYPE FACTOR and you got crushed.No one says it better than Chris Rock at the MTV music awards.  - Someone is walking around with 59 000 dollars in their pocket. - I hope so, cause I could have made this movie with 1000 dollars and a free week-end, says I.",1,2,3,7 October 1999
