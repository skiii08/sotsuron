Angels & Demons," Utter Crap
","This is absolutely one of the worst movies ever made. Terrible. Ridiculous plot, stupid 'twists,' bad acting, Howard's directing is contrived and banal, with hokey dialogue. Since the source material is just stupid and vapid, what do you expect? Those seeking escapist fare look for something else, anything else, this makes '17 Again' look like 'Gone with the Wind.' This movie fails on every level, with the pacing kept at a manic pace so that you don't have time to think about the laughable plot. A movie should be true to the world it is in; this movie is not. Only the streets of Rome give any interest and some nice Bernini sculpture takes your eyes away from this tripe bag of garbage. What a waste of money and talent. Of course it will take in some $, but don't be fooled, this movie will make you howl in disbelief.",1,15,40,19 May 2009
Zulu," Just great
","action movie that also deals with British class structure of the time - really exciting and well done - Michael Caine is great as the initial 'foppish' officer, historic event with a lot of accuracy - the sequel is not quite as good -",10,0,2,26 March 2002
Dodgeball," Funny and Great
","One of the funniest movies made in recent years. Just an excellent cast. Fine, smart comedy, taking on various subjects in a sly way. Great script withnumerous hilarious lines. Stiller is amazing. Vaugh's best performance since Swingers. As a straight man, he delivers. Gary Cole as an announce for 'ESPN -8 'The Ocho' is brilliant, as is the whole concept of an obscure sports network. Great cameo's too, that actually form a key element of the story. Stiller's wife is excellent as the love interest. A very broad comedy that had me literally sliding off my seat in laughter. A very smart film, witty with great timing. Highly recommend this film - if you like Steve Martin's great comedy's, this is for you. I could see this again real soon. Wonderful.",10,0,0,1 July 2004
Dodgeball," Funny and Smart
","Just a funny movie that parodies a wide range of subject. Stiller's character is just that. He is great!! Vince Vaughn as the straight man is tremendous. Great timing. What makes this movie so fun is the all out, over the top, making fun of sports and the various personality type that inhabit sport (even an outlandish concept of 'professional dodgeball'). Rip Torn is great as usual. The 'commentary' during the dodgeball tourney is fall on the floor hilarious! Excellent physical comedy, if violent, but hey, if you don't like it you don't get the joke. This is a film for people who actually understand how comedy is made. And don't leave early, you will be rewarded by Stiller after the credits. This is comedy with an edge.",10,0,1,6 December 2004
