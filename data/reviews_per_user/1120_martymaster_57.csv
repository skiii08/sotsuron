The Rock," Great action
","This is one of those few superb action movies,which gives you exactly what you are expecting,action,adventure,fast cars, etc. The cast in this movie is great,and to name a few,it consists of Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris.As you can see this is doomed to be a mega block buster.The story is about a bunch of soldiers who take over Alcatraz and  threaten to use  nerve gas against San Francisco.I enjoyed this movie so much that I bought it and now I have seen it about 20 times.I guess most of you have seen this movie and for those who has not,I can only say that this is one of the cooleset action movies you will ever see.",Null,3,3,11 September 2001
Requiem for a Dream," Unlike anything you have ever seen before.
","This movie is unique,it shows drug abuse in a whole new way. In the leading roles you'll find Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans.They all delivers the best performances of their career.Especially Ellen Burstyn who does one of the best roles ever in movie history.The director of the movie is Darren Aronofsky who is unknown for most people,but has made great movies before. This movie has one of the best soundtracks ever,and I got chills every time I heard Summer overture true out the movie. The movie is great edited and use new spesial fx,as a way to explain drug abuse.Visually this movie is great.The story is also very powerful and touches everyone who sees it. The movie starts out slowly and builds up to a climax at the end,the last 15 minutes of the movie is so intense and dramatic and will touch you deep inside.It is sad to see what drugs can do with people and in this movie you see how bad it can turn out.The ending is one of the sadest endings I have ever seen.I didnt move a finger before after the end credits.And then I couldn't believe what I had seen,this is the movie that you cant get out of your mind in several days.A movie that will move even the toughest people. 10 out of 10",Null,0,1,16 March 2002
G.I. Jane," Cool movie.
","Demi Moore really deserves credit for playing in this movie,not many female actors would dare to take this role,especially because they had to shave their heads for the role. This movie is supposed to show us how hard the navy SEALS training is(is it really this hard?).The movie has a cool atmosphere and show young guys who has to go through the hardest training in the world and in the middle you find little Demi Moore.This is a war movie with a little twist.What more can I say,except this is a good movie with good acting.7 out of 10",Null,1,3,8 September 2001
Se7en," Bravo!!!
","Se7en is a good thriller with some strong scenes. The acting performance is very good and the atmosphere is dark and sad through out the movie. This is one of the movies where the bad guy is so bad that you just want to go into the teli and shoot him.The movie is about a serial killer  who uses the seven deadly sins as his motive and it's not a pretty sight.The ending is one of the things that shocked me about this movie,it is not happy.So if you are looking for a really scary thriller with some great acting,then se7en is the movie.8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,19 August 2001
The Big Lebowski," Dude has a great lifestyle.

Memento," This movie is unlike anything you have ever seen before.
","This movie really needs you to be focused and pay attention,because there is so many things going on and the story is put together in reverse.But that is what I liked about it.You see, this is not your ordinary movie,its actually one of a kind.Every scene starts without you knowing anything and then you get to see more and more into the past and what has happened. This movie really keeps on surprising you to the very end and I think the clue is to see this movie two times to figure out everything. There arent many characters in this movie and only about 4 persons that you get to learn about,but I think that was great because there are so many things going on at the same time that you don't have the time to remember many different character.All in all this is a very good movie and the director deserves credit for making a movie unlike anything you have seen before.9 out of 10.",Null,0,1,26 August 2001
Kickboxer," The only good Kickboxer movie in the series.
","It has been made a lot of sequels in this series,but this one is the only that is worth watching. It is kind of like Rocky,in the sense that he traines all the movie for a fight in the end. The fight scenes are hardcore and the one at the end is quite cool. This cant be compared to the best movies of Jackie Chan and Jet Li,but it is still a good martial arts movie.One of Van Dammes best to date.",Null,23,30,21 January 2002
Rocky V," Worst in the series.
","This movie is the worst of the Rocky movies and one of the reasons is because Rocky doesn't fight any real cool matches as in the other movies. In this movie Rocky is the trainer of a new boxer and does only have one fighting scene at the end of the movie,(some kind of street fight). This movie also envolves a lot around Rockys son,and that is just facked up. We see the Rocky movies because we want to see Rocky fight,not to see him coach or to see his son.Stay away from this one,unless you have decided to see the whole series.BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Null,1,4,7 September 2001
The Others," A great old fashion horror movie.
","This is a horror movie that is made on the old fashion horror recipe,it has an old house and lots of darkness and of course ghosts. The whole setting is simply great. This movie has some scenes that will literally make you jump of your seat.I remember one scene where almost all the people in the cinema jumped of their seats and covered their eyes.It is not a shocking scene,but i just catch you by surprise and it happens so quick. A very positive thing about this movie is Nicole Kidman,I have never thought of her as such a great actress,but this movie really proved me wrong.She is excellent in her role,and I think she deserved an oscar for it.The two kids in the movie is also really great. This is a movie you have to see.",Null,1,3,15 April 2002
Snatch," Great!!!
","This is one of my favorite movies.It is directed by Guy Ritchie and stars many famous actors like Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro. The movie is brilliant put together with lots of different stories meeting each other.But to sum it up,it is about steeling a diamond. The camera work is one thing that I love about this movie,it is very original and uses lots of clever new ways to show reactions and other things. I can not say enough good things about this movie,you really have to see for your self. 10 out of 10.",Null,0,1,26 May 2002
Taxi Driver," GREAT performance by Robert De Niro.
","This is a really good movie.The story is kind of dark and a lot takes place in the underground among crime and prostitution.Robert De Niro delivers on of his best performances ever and Jodie Foster is amazing.I can't believe that any girl at her age could act that part so good. This is simply a classic,that everyone interested in movies should see.",Null,0,0,20 June 2002
Full Metal Jacket," Full Metal Jacket is among my favorite war movies.

Rocky II," Better than the first one.
","This movie follows up the first one and is about the match between Apollo and Rocky.In this movie the fighting scenes has been approved and the story as well.The one thing that irritates me about the Rocky movies is Rocky's wife,she is so stupid and weak that it just makes me sick. Why do Rocky like here? But enough about that.This is better than the first one and therefor the directors decided to make a new one and so it keeps going.I have written a review on all the Rocky movies so if you want to compare them,just look at my reviews.One of the things that I love about the Rocky movie are the atmosphere around the fights,it is so cool. And the fact that Rocky never keeps his guard up is exellente,because then it seems like he can handle a beating. And the sound when someone is hit is like they have been hit by a bare fist,Smack.A cool movie,and a good contribute to the Rocky series.",Null,0,0,6 September 2001
Fargo," I am never going to get tired of this movie
","Simply a great movie. Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi plays the two hit men that are hired by William H. Macy to kidnap his wife. I have to say that Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi are as made for this role as the two 'out of control' maniacs. The story takes place in a little town and the characters are very interesting. Every thing that you can expect to go wrong,goes wrong for the characters in this movie.This movie will make you laugh,cry,scream and laugh again. Simply a masterpiece.See it and find out what I mean.",Null,0,0,3 August 2001
Pitch Black," Great Sci-fi!!!!!!
","This is one of the better science fiction movies I have seen.The story is really good and scary about a spaceship which lands on a abandon planet which has three suns.They then find out that there has been people on the planet,but they are all dead.Since the planet has three suns it is only night every 22 year,and its in the night that the creatures which has killed every living thing on the planet comes out.And guess what,its getting darker. The fx and picture quality is also very good and this together with a great story makes one hell of a science fiction thriller.In the lead role we find Vin Diesel which I really got my eyes open for after this movie,he is a great actor which I guarantee the you will see in a lot of movie in the near future.They are now working on a sequel which is named The Chronicles of Riddick,it will be out in 2003 so you better look forward to that.",7,0,0,8 December 2001
American Beauty," Kevin Spacey is always great.
","Very very good. This movie has it all,great actors,an amazing story,good dialogues and a great atmosphere.Kevin Spacey is as always amazing and without him the movie would never be as good as it is. I think he is the only one that could play that role as good as he did. This movie is really funny at times and also very sad sometimes.So we most not think of this as a complete comedy,but instead as a drama movie that shows us a real side of life. This is a 'one of a kind movie' and it is just excellent.Go see it. 8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,18 August 2001
BASEketball," Funny,but sometimes a little stupid.
","The story is about two loser friends who invent a new game that combines basketball and baseball.Of course you dont have to be an athlete to compete in it and thats why almost all the teams consist of very strange people.The game is so silly that it becomes stupid and you really have to see if you would like to find out what I mean. The movie has some really Funny scenes that will make you laugh to you burst,but unfortunately the plot and acting does not qualify for a great movie,but who cares. The important thing is that you laugh and I can promise you that you will.",Null,1,2,20 September 2001
Rocky IV," Rocky gets more beating than ever before.
","This is my favourite Rocky movie together with Rocky 3.In this movie Rocky fight against the ultimate strong Drago. Drago (Dolph Lundgren) is the strongest and most though of all Rockys opponents so look forward to some super fighting scenes. What makes Drago so though is because he almost never talks and he actualy kills his opponents.In this movie,Rocky gets beaten up like never before and the fighting scenes at the end is more graphic and longer.They also gives you a great feeling because of the music and people screaming in the background.Go see this one or Drago will come for you.",Null,0,0,7 September 2001

American History X," An important movie.
","At last a movie that takes up the subject about racism. This movie shows what racism can do to a person and the people around him. We follow the main character Derek Vinyard and his brother Daniel 'Danny' Vinyard in their lives from when they were young and ordinary kids and as they grow up blinded by racism because of the death of their father,who was killed by some black men. They both become neo-nazies,but finds out after a while that it is wrong,but its to late.This movie contains some really strong scenes,but I think as many people as possible should see it because the movie really shows how wrong it is to hate someone because of their religion or skin colour.This is an important movie and director Tony Kaye has made a movie that will shock many,but we have to remember that this is reality and that we have to face it,for it to go away.Very goood. 8 out of 10",Null,0,0,17 August 2001
The Usual Suspects," Maybe my favorite movie.
","Very very good. Kevin Spacey does maybe the best role in his carrier playing Verbal Kint,even better than his role in Seven. This is a true thriller with a outstanding plot and the best ending in history of movies. Almost all the actors does their best role ever in this movie. The leading actors are: Kevin Spacey,Stephen Baldwin,Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak,Chazz Palminteri and Pete Postlethwaite.This movie is actually so good,that I saw it two days in a row and the second time I will promise you that you will notice a lot of new things that you didn't think of the first time.One of the moments I loved in this movie is when Chazz Palminteri lean down towards Kevin Spacey and whisper 'I am smarter than you',you have no idea how wrong he is.

Resident Evil," Best zombie movie ever.
","This must be the best adaption from a game to a movie ever. After having been a fan of the game series for a long time,I really looked forward to the movie and I had high expectations.And I was not disappointed when the movie was finished.I recognized a lot from the games and the story of the T-virus was well told.The parts that they left out in the story I'll guess will be in the sequel that will be out 2003.The movie had action non-stop and there were a lot of zombies and cool shoot out scenes.After having seen all those terrible zombie movies from the 70s I was glad to see this one.Without a doubt the best zombie movie I have seen.8 out of 10.",Null,0,1,26 May 2002

","A good comedy,as simple as that.The story is about a lawyer who can't lie for 24 hours because his son wished for it.This turns out to cause a lot of problems,because of the lawyer lies for a living. The movie has many funny and embarrassing moments,that will make you laugh and laugh again.So what more can I say except,this is a good comedy.",Null,2,3,14 September 2001
Saving Private Ryan," Just fiction but very good.
","The story of the movie is really simple,it is about an expedition that are looking for a guy in the middle of world war two.It is of course fiction about this privat Ryan they are looking for,but the movie still captures a lot of the second world war. What makes the story so great is what the soldiers experience on their way and that they have to stick together to survive. All the actors does a great job playing their roles and especially Tom Hanks,who I think never have played a bad role.The movie contains some strong scenes and some sad moments when young soldiers lying around screaming and waiting to die.The movie is great told with very good camera work,but thats what you expect from Steven Spielberg movie.Steven Spielberg has made another great movie that is worth watching.I give it a 9 out of 10.",8,0,1,18 August 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Most wonderful movie I have ever seen.
","This is maybe my favourite movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a remarkable movie. The movie, which is directed by Ang Lee, certainly qualifies as an 'art movie' but it is also very entertaining.The film has become widely known for its impressive martial arts sequences,but the underlying love story is equally powerful. The movie has some of exceptional special effects, that you have never seen before. The photography and choreography are also exceptional and the music is amazing, it really matches the atmosphere,scenes and feelings between the different characters. The plot concerns around the fateful decision of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) to retire his trusted warrior's weapon, the Green Destiny, a sword that has proven to be both a blessing and a curse. But one day the Green Destiny is stolen and they begin to discover that the sword may be in the hands of Jade Fox, the notorious warrior who killed Li Mu Bai's master. And then they start the pursuit of her and whats soon to be discovered as her student.You must remember that this movie is nothing like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies. Here, martial arts are used to underscore the emotions of the story. Whenever the characters are filled with anger, love, hate, jealousy or joy you can expect to see those emotions displayed artfully through combat.There is a great deal of fighting, but little blood or gore. I guarantee that the fighting scenes in this movie is the most spectacular you have ever seen.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the most wonderful movies I have seen, and the movie takes place in a decade in chinese history that is very facinating and beautiful. You are also going to notice that this movie has some strong  feminine characters,such as Michelle Yeoh and ZiYi Zhang, and they delivers maybe the greatest performances of the year.Go see this one,you wont regret it.I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,22 August 2001
Schindler's List," Spielbergs greatest movie!!!
","This is the best made movie of the second world war so far in the meaning that it  captures the viewers so well and draw os into the plot.We truly get to see how tragic it was.Of course no one can truly explaine how tragic and gruesome it was,but Spielberg does a dam go job. This is a very powerful movie that you will remember for many years to come.The whole movie is told in black/white and the characters are so extremely well played.Especially Oscar Chindler which is played by Liam Neeson.(He was born for that role.)The movie last for over 3 hours,but you don't even notice the time because the story is so touching.I think everybody should at least see this movie once in their lifetime. Maybe if everyone could see the movie,it could be a better world.One of the best movies I have seen.",Null,9,14,14 August 2001
The Game," Great plot

","You got to love this one.I can't believe that people say that they don't like this movie,because I facking enjoyed it. This movie has some really creepy scenes and also some gore and a good scary atmosphere. Other from that the plot is outstanding,telling you about an other world where everything is evil and the gateway to this world is on a space ship abandon in other space. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill play their roles great.This movie combines Horror and Sci-fi great and gives you an entertaining story.",Null,1,2,28 September 2001
Dumb and Dumber," Very dumb,but also funny.
","This movie is a no-brainer and is all about dumb humor. The two main characters Harry and Lloyd is played by Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey. They do a good job looking stupid and playing stupid. The movie has many comedic highlights that will make you laugh for a long time. The story is very weak,but most comedies are.I enjoyed it very much the first time i saw it and also the second time. But after having seen it many times,it starts to get boring and only few highlights will make you laugh.Really good as a silly/stupid comedy,but nothing else.",Null,0,2,29 September 2001
From Dusk Till Dawn," Really original story.
","I will bet that you have never seen a movie like this,it starts out like any other ordinary thriller or action movie and you dont expect a thing of what is going to happen.But the suddenly the whole story turns,and all most all the people becomes vampires,and the movie becomes a big gore fest with some really explicit violence. It has been made 3 movies in this series and this is the best one,with the third one on a close second.Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino is really two masterminds who have made some of the coolest movies in a long time.And they do not disapoint with this ground breaking movie.If you like this one then be sure to check out the third one,which is very similar.And maybe the second one although it is not that great.

Black Hawk Down," I really enjoyed it.
","This is a war movie,but unlike others it dont show the world war 2,instead it shows the tragic event that took place in Somalia in the 90s.This movie is very strong and shows war in a realistic way.It show that the victims are often sivilians and that soldiers are often afraid too.The thing that surprised me most about this movie,is all the gun firing and action.There are constant combat for two hours.I were expecting a slow type of war movie,but this turned out to be one of the most explosive and best war movies that I have seen.Don't get me wrong,war movies are very though and not to be joked with.They are in fact based on true tragic events.This movie also contain a little humor,represented by one soldier,who act a little goofy because he is def.Other than that this is a realistic and strong movie,that will make many of you think of war in an other way.I consider this to be one of the best war movies I have seen,and by far the one with most action,but what can you expect when you have Ridley Scott as director and Jerry Bruckheimer as producer. Go see it in cinema if you want the full effect,great sound quality. I give it a 8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,25 March 2002
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantinos breakthrough movie
","This movie is like no other movie you have ever seen.The dialogues are extremely well made and so is the scenes in the movie. The whole movie is only filmed in a few locations and all are very important to the atmosphere. In this movie Quentin Tarantino has really gotten all the best actors as you can see on the list.Harvey Keitel ....  Mr. White/Larry  Tim Roth ....  Mr. Orange/Freddy  Michael Madsen ....  Mr. Blonde/Vic  Chris Penn ....  Nice Guy Eddie  Steve Buscemi ....  Mr. Pink  Edward Bunker ....  Mr. Blue (as Eddie Bunker)  Quentin Tarantino ....  Mr. Brown  The movie is built up with long dialogues and not that much action. But as you will see this is good for the plot of the movie and it gives you a insight into all the main characters. Even though this is not the best movie I have seen,I have to say that it is brilliant made and the attitude to the different characters is just amazing.I will just say that this movie have won many awards and almost every critic loved it,so it is worth buying.",Null,0,1,31 July 2001

","This is the first movie in the Rocky series and I must say that it is one of the worst in the series. I know that everyone think that this is the best because it is original and it is here everything started.I found the movie quit boring and don't let me start on the main characters. All the Rocky movies are built up in the same way:Rocky train the whole movie and at the end he fights his opponents.But in this movie the training scenes sucked and the fight at the end also sucked. I know that this is a old movie so therefor the quality and fx are bad but they could at least have made the story more interesting.I know that this is sylvester Stallones breakthrough movie and therefor I will not say more bad things about it.There are better Rocky movies,but many people want to have seen the whole series and that is why this movie has been seen by so many people and loved by someone.All in all this is a BAD movie.",Null,0,0,6 September 2001

Ving Rhames...........The movie is directed by the mastermind Quentin Tarantino and he is known to use  a lot of the same actors in all of his movies,he also has a little role for him self in every movie.This movie has like Resovoire Dogs,many stories going at once that is brilliant mixed together.I advice everyone,even though they are not a Quentin Tarantino fan to watch this movie because it is truly one of the greatest movies ever made.",Null,0,1,31 July 2001
Titanic," Love story mixed together with a big tragedy.
","James Cameron has done a good job making one of the centuries big block busters.He has used the tragic titanic accident as the background and mixed in a great love story about a poor kid and a rich women. This is really a big budget movie and it is not hard to figure out why,because they had to build everything new and some of the fx when the boat sinks are just amazing. The plot of the movie is not very deep and the 3 hours goes by like 2 hours and 50min. We must not forget that this is a BIG tragedy and that the love story is just fiction.It is not one of my favourit movies, but I have to give James Camron credit for making a big budget movie like this.If you are a guy between 15 and 30 I advice you to go and pick up a die hard movie instead.But if you are a girl or women then this is a must.Ps:I did actually see some boys coming crying out of the cinema.",7,1,2,14 August 2001
Rocky III," The coolest in the series.
","This is the coolest Rocky movie in the series,and by the coolest I mean that it may not be the best,but the fighting scenes are awsome.The reason why this separate from the other Rocky movies is because Rocky faces Mr.T as Clubber Lang and he is a beast like nothing you have ever seen before. He are like an animal in the ring and makes the fighting scenes in this movie one of the coolest ever.Another reason why I like this movie is because Mr.T has his birthday on the same date as I,and you gotto love that.I think this is maybe the best Rocky movie,with Rocky 4 on a close second place.So if you like fighting scenes or Sylvester Stallone then this is a must.This is pure entertaining so I guess many people enjoy this movie,because you don't have to think.Just sit back and relax.",Null,2,3,6 September 2001

Actually all characters were great, and the fact that the movie is based on a true story just make it even better. The movie takes place in Stalingrad under the second world war and the scenes is very detailed and gives you the feeling of being there. The whole movie has a dark atmosphere and gives you this creepy feeling, because you dont know what is happening next.You can also expect a lot of intense moments,especially some shooting scenes.

The word green mile comes from the expression 'to walk down the green mile towards your execution'. The whole movie takes place inside a death row block in prison with the few guards and prisoners that are there.If you are looking for a drama movie,this is what you need.

Platoon," Maybe the best war movie ever made.
","One of the reasons why this is a great movie,is because Oliver Stone directed it,and the fact that almost all of his movies are great.This movie describes the Vietnam war much better than other movies in the way that we see everything that happens to a young boy (Charlie Sheen),from the day he gets there and till he leaves. It shows how innocent people are killed and that the americans are wiling to do everything to win the war. The american generals send their men into a certain death.
The battles scenes are very realistic and explicit and this movie is not for people who cant handle violence.This movie has so many famous actors that it was doomed to be a hit.Among the actors are,Tom Berenger,Willem Dafoe,Charlie Sheen,Forest Whitaker,Francesco Quinn,John C.

I found the movie very entertaining even though I usually dont like animation movies.You also find some great actors who have put their voices on the characters,to name a few:Eddie Murphy,Cameron Diaz,John Lithgow,Mike Myers All I can say is that this is a fun movie with a original story.",Null,0,0,21 October 2001
Tombstone," God vs Bad
",This is the classic story about the god guys in the west vs the bad. I think everyone agree when I says that this is Val Kilmers best role ever.He plays the role of  Doc Holliday and he gets so into his role and gives us a rare performance that you not often see.I compare this movie to Young Guns because both of them has a great story and a lot of famous actors.Kurt Russel does also a great job as Wyatt Earp in this movie. And the movie really gives you the feeling that you are in the wild west.The Best western I have seen along with Young Guns.,Null,0,0,11 August 2001
The Deer Hunter," An unforgettable movie.
","This is a movie with a touching story about friendship and most of all in shows the horror of the Vietnam war. This movie has some of the best acting performances I have seen,and I am of course talking about Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken. They really goes into their roles and creates a great atmosphere. This movie also contains one of the most famous scenes in movie history,the russian roulett scene.This scene is so intense and creepy to watch. One of the few great Vietnam movies ever.",Null,55,108,23 February 2002
The Sixth Sense," God dam,Haley Joel Osment is talented.
","This is a brilliant movie with a very original plot and some great actors.The movie is about a this kid,Cole Sear,who is a problemed boy in the way that he claims to see dead people.And Bruce Willies plays a child psychologist who takes interesse in helping the boy. I must say that I was shocked by how good Haley Joel Osment played his role(Cole Sear),he is maybe the best child actor out there and I can promise that he will star in many movies to come. He plays his role in a way that makes you feel really sorry for the boy.The scenes are wonderful filmed and directed. The ending is superb and shocking in the way that you didn't expect it.This is a true thriller with some really scary scenes.All in all this is a wonderful movie that you will never forget. 9 out of 10",Null,0,0,20 August 2001
Final Destination," Great entertainment.
","I found this movie really cool.The movie nerver runs slow and there are lots of cool death scenes.This movie also makes you think about destiny and how you live your life.The acting isn't anything special,but with this story and fx,you don't need good acting to be entertained.Even though this is set to be a horror movie it also has a lot of comedy,mostly contributed by Seann William Scott. This cool horror movie,will keep your attention to the very end.",Null,0,2,22 June 2002
A Night at the Roxbury," A great movie,with a cool sound track
","Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan plays two brothers who is caught by the disco fever. Many of you will recognize Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan from the saturday night live show,and they are as you all know really really crazy and hilarious. And like Saturday night live,they also show their funny side in this movie.They are so stupid and funny that you are going to laugh your tongue out.This movie features also one of the best sound tracks ever,there are so much 80's dance music there,and it all goes excellent with the movie. I dont think 80's music is great,but in this movie it works perfectly.Just see this movie,I guarantee that it will be one of the funniest movies you have seen.",Null,3,4,1 October 2001
The Matrix," One of the best movies of all times!
","This is the best sci-fi movie I have seen, and maybe also the best movie I have ever seen.The script is just mind blowing and the acting performance is superb. In the lead role you will find Keanu Reeves in his best role ever,for sure.This role is made for Keanu Reeves and nobody,and by that I mean nobody,could play it as good as he did. As you probably know,big movies like this get sequels and they are no working on Matrix 2 and 3.And I must say that I cant wait for them to come.I also know that Keanu Reeves is going to play the lead role in all of the,so that is a relief.Don't miss out on the greatest movie of all time,the script is so original and makes you think that it maybe could be true.(just wait and see,you will know what I mean).10 out of 10 of course.",Null,0,0,18 September 2001
Cube," So many questions unanswered,but still a great movie.
","This is a really weird and original movie,a bunch of people wake up inside a cube with no idea about how they got there.We dont get to know much about their life stories either,all we know is that if they stay inside the cube,much longer they will starve to death. The interesting thing about this movie,is the dialogue between the different people and to watch what happens to humans when they get put in front of this type of situations.The start to get enemies just after a short while.This movies is a low budget movie with all unknow actors and it is filmed inside two different cubes(watch the dvd),but still it is a great movie,I think the idea of the plot is genius.I just wish we got more answers about how they got there or who built the cube. I look forward to cube 2,which is set to be finished in 2002,but I have heard that it has no relations with cube 1.Maybe it will give us more answers.Even though this movie kind of a mystery and left you wondering about a lot of things,I still loved it.Maybe the reason was that it made you think about human nature and that some situations can make humans capable of almost anything. I advice you to watch it with directors comentary.",Null,0,1,24 May 2002
The Thin Red Line," Why do everyone think this movie is bad?
","I dont understand why so many people dislike this movie.I thought it was good.It is in fact one of my favorite war movies,considering that there are not so many war movies out there.This movie shows a better perspective of each soldier and there emotions.It also has one of the best casts I have ever seen.The thin red line,like Saving private Ryan,shows only a a special event in the second world war.The movie shows the americans taking over a little island from the Japanese,in the pacific.I think this movie is very underrated,but must admit that it has moments where it goes a little slow and I think that they could cut the length by half an hour and still tell the same story,because it is a little to long. But all in all I think it is a good movie.",Null,0,2,25 March 2002
Jackie Brown," Great acting performances.
","This movie containes one of the best acting performances I have ever seen.All the actors plays their roles so convincing. Allthough this movie not has as much violence as the other Tarantino movies,it still is a great movie. The dialogues are really cool and so are the characters. The movie is very long and you have to be a Tarantino fan to truly enjoy it.The camera work is great and the story is also good.Not Tarantinos best movie,but still very good.",Null,0,1,14 October 2001
Braveheart," An amazing story you got to see.
","Mel Gibson has done an amazing job directing and playing the lead role in this fantastic movie.The movie is about William Wallace,who is a commoner and how he unites the 13th Century Scots in their battle to overthrow English rule.This is a tragic story about men and women who have lost their freedom and how they are willing to do everything to get it back. The battle scenes are the best I have ever seen with over thousands men fighting.But they are also very brutal and shows how many innocent who looses their lives. The movie shows also how William Wallace's wife is taken from him and that he is willing to do everything to avenge her death.All the actors are very convincing and you really get the feeling of how it must have been to live in the 13th Century. The music to the movie is also wonderful and it helps creating a tragic atmosphere at the battlefields and funerals.This is one of the few really great movies I have seen and I never get tired of watching it.Mel Gibson's best role ever.I give it a 9 out of 10.A wonderful movie.",8,0,1,15 August 2001
True Romance," This movie has almost every famous actors you can wish for.
","One of the greatest movies ever made. I compare it to such movies as Pulp Fiction because of all the great actors and a great story.(And of course very violent).This movie has so many famous actors in it that you can't believe it. And with all this actors doing a great job,you have to accept that this is a great movie. Here are some of them:Christian Slater ....  Clarence Worley  Patricia Arquette ....  Alabama Whitman  Dennis Hopper ....  Clifford Worley  Val Kilmer ....  Mentor (Elvis)  Gary Oldman ....  Drexl Spivey  Brad Pitt ....  Floyd  Christopher Walken ....  Vincenzo Coccotti  Bronson Pinchot ....  Elliot Blitzer  Samuel L. Jackson ....  Big Don  Michael Rapaport ....  Dick Ritchie  Chris Penn ....  Nicky Dimes  Tom Sizemore ....  Cody Nicholson Many of you will find this movie to violent and raw and to you I can suggest getting the cut version,actually this is the version that is easiest to get.The uncut version does only exist in some countries,and are not for people who can't stand blood and much violence. One of the things the uncut version show us more from,is the scene where Patricia Arquette is almost beaten to death,this is a really strong scene and I must admit I had problems watching it.You feel so sorry for her,and it is not often you see a girl get beaten,so I advice you to look away or get the cut version,because you get this sad feeling inside of you.But if you look away from all the violence,there is till a great love story and a entertaining plot. This movie also feature one of the really great scenes in movie history,I am of course talking about the scene with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken when they are talking face to face and tries to show us who is the toughest.Go see this one,it has humor,violence,every famous actor out there,cool story,love story,yeah actually everything you can wish for.9 out of 10.",Null,0,2,25 September 2001
Gladiator," A great story.
","The story is about Maximus who was a general in the emperors army,but after his friend Commodus betrayed him,he became a slave and had to fight for his freedom.This movie got lots of action,great story and of course great actors.(what more can you want.) I hadn't seen to many movies about the Roman empire so this one just blew me away. The fighting scenes is awesome,especially the ones in Coloseum.This movie is absoulutely among my top ten movies,and I would recommend it to everyone.9 out of 10********* of **********I loved it from beginning to end.",9,0,0,14 August 2001
Goodfellas," Maybe the best mafia movie ever.
","This movie is just perfect.It has a great cast,a great director and a great story.I am especially surprised by Joe Pescis acting,he is just amazing in this movie,definitely his best movie yet.Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta is also great.The story is very weel told and you get to see the life of a kid while growing up and becoming a powerful man in the mafia.The mafia is really good material for a movie,because it is really cool to see how powerful they are and that they are usually above the law. This is really a masterpiece.",Null,0,0,10 June 2002
