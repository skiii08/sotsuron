Black Swan," My Opinion
","This movie is known to be a movie where you either love it or hate it. It's a very interpretive, powerful and symbolic film. Personally, I love it. The director does an incredible job playing with the plot and the characters to lead you to certain conclusions, but then misguiding you, tricking you..etc. The entire story leaves you hanging, shaking or wanting more. He also uses black and white to symbolize generalized good vs. evil. He is very direct with this symbol, yet seemingly indirect. His entire approach to the development of the plot and characters is so peculiar and different that it is nothing but intriguing. It can be classified as a physiological thriller, so it really toys with your mind. People argue that this movie was confusing and contradicting, but I believe that Aronfsky did that on purpose. And that his intentions were to make the watchers question themselves on what was reality and what was fantasy.",10,2,4,11 January 2014
