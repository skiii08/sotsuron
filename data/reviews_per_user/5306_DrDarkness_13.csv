Angels & Demons," Very good movie, but comparing to the book...
","The movie was very good, and I'm a huge Tom Hanks fan. But this wasn't his best flicks.Angels & Demons -movie is VERY different from the book, and some changes I could understand, since the movie was only 2,5 hours long. But some changes could've been undone -like the very beginning of the movie. They tied Vittoria Vetra to the story with very light reasons, when the dead scientist wasn't Vittoria's father -like in the book. The story would've been much better, if she'd had more personal touch on the whole thing than just finding the anti-material.And there were lots of this kind of not-need-to-do changes in the film. Also I was a bit disappointed when Langdon/Hanks didn't go to the helicopter at the end. It would've been so much more cooler.And many of the original characters were gone or placed with another one.But.. Oh well. I DID like the book better. But I'll give 7 out of 10 anyways. Could've been better though.",7,1,4,17 May 2009
Your Name.," Just... Wow.
","Okay - one thing we need to make clear. Exchanging bodies. Not a 'never been done' feature, and usually executed as running gags of 'oh I got boobs' and 'oh I got a pee pee'. If you're hesitant to watch this movie because of this story aspect I can assure you - it gets noted with some expected gags, but in this movie the characters actually get over it!Kimi No Na Wa is a wonderful anime in both story line and art. It's so rare to find an anime with these two so perfectly combined that it alone made me want to cry from happiness.This movie is one heck of a ride. It instantly grabs your interest and the story has some very, VERY well done twists. I honestly can't find any fault with this one - stunning visuals, well written characters, exquisite storyline... Everything hits home. Even if you happen to be one of those people who don't much care for romances, this movie presents a challenging mystery and the plot is so satisfying!I'm so happy this anime exists.",10,1,2,3 September 2018
Hereditary," A bit controversial, but fun to watch
","I am a horror movie fan, but this proved to be a bit difficult title to review. Did I enjoy it? Yes. How was the acting? Mostly good. Did the movie get to me? Here and there, yes. But would I watch it again? Probably not. Would I recommend this? Definitely, if you like suspenful horror films and despise jump scares - this is a movie for you.However, I do get why some people here have given this movie such a low score. It is a slow-paced story and yes, the ending could've been more unique or clever as the rest of the film had been. But by all means it's not horrible, far from it.If looking at the whole movie it's definitely enjoyable - yes, the pace is slow, but for myself I found most of the story so interesting that it didn't bother me at all. There were some very well done scenes where the time seems to stop, but it fits with the general atmosphere.So, the biggest problem for me was mostly the ending. It was still well excecuted and some scenes were highly disturbing - even when they looked like they were done with Photoshop and a steel wire. But it was like the writer/director had grown bored with the story just before the end and just let his neighbor finish it for him. This might sound harsh, but hey, I've seen worse.Still, as I said earlier, very enjoyable movie and most of the time it creates it's own path and doesn't slip to the clichÃ©s.",6,0,1,28 August 2018
The Babadook," Babadook haunts you long after watching this
","We all have monsters, maybe they're not physical, but they can be memories, dreams or just packed up feelings. And while they haven't got real bodies, they can be more scary than anything we know.The Babadook is a story about mother and her troubled child. The father passed away in a car accident on the same day when their son was born and after that the mother, Amelia, tries to raise Robbie as well as she can. It isn't easy, especially when Robbie is convinced that monsters can be real. On one evening, while searching for a bedtime story from the shelf, Robbie finds a peculiar red book called 'The Babadook'. When Amelia opens that book, she doesn't know that she just opened a door for something else.The Babadook was refreshingly interesting and well made. It has some good scares, but luckily the movie doesn't sink to basic Hollywood tricks - which are nowadays almost a cliché. Instead the movie gathers focus to the mother, her son and their attempts to survive, even when the enemy is not always clear. There will be lots of doubt, lots of 'aha' moments and the watcher is slowly sucked in with the story.Beware - this movie will not only haunt you. After watching this you will realize that Babadook is always with you.",7,1,4,29 March 2015
Bird Box," Strong cast can't save an average movie
","I was positively surprised to see Sandra Bullock stepping out from the darkness after not seeing her for such a long time. I've always loved her and same goes to John Malkovich. When the movie started and I saw them together I thought 'wow, I'm so happy I get to see them together, and the movie seems promising too!'But I'm sorry to say that the plot of this film was average at it's best. Everything else was from okay to great - the director Susanne Bier does a decent job and personally I have nothing to complain about her work. All the actors, even the small kids, do a fine job.So what went wrong? The plot, the whole story. It had a promising hook with pretty unique monsters. Without saying too much I'll just state that I was perfectly fine with the way the story dealt with the entities - that's not the problem. The problem was unimaginative and dull story with lukewarm twists that you could foresee from miles away.In my books this film goes to category B-, a movie which I will never watch again because it would be too damn boring.",5,1,3,3 January 2019
A Quiet Place," Not exactly innovative, but very enjoyable
","Let's get one thing clear - aliens killing people and relying on some highly superior sense to hunt them down. Not a unique idea, but in this film it's already established how the alien lifeform can detect humans and now the few survivors around the world are trying to keep on living and staying alive.So it's kind of a mix of survival horror and an alien invasion, but mostly of how the survivors adapt to their life of hiding and still trying to live through the day. It's enjoyable and eerie to watch, since the rule here is simple; keep quiet. So, instead of seeing people crouching inside small, narrow hiding places, we get to see them walking in a broad daylight.The film is also well directed and shot, Emily Blunt is great as always (it's really nice to see her more and more as a leading actress these days) and the story - well, it's not anything I've never seen before, but it's okay. The ending is a bit of a letdown (mostly because I could tell how it was going to end from maybe after 30 minutes from the start) but it wasn't enough to make me feel cheated.And since horror is probably one of the hardest genres to make films of, A Quiet Place does a good job of keeping you hooked 'till the end. Maybe not the greatest horror movie there is, but definitely something I'd recommend.",6,0,1,30 August 2018
The Hangover Part II," Isn't different enough from the first one.
","I admit that I kinda might had too high expectations for this one. The first movie was absolutely hilarious -you don't know what to expect when the guys start solve the problem. 'What did we do last night?' 'Where's one of us?' Well, to sum it up; in first movie they have a party night. They wake up next morning and one of the guys is missing. They start by looking for the clues one by one. There's a Chinese guy. There's a fatal mix-up when they try to find their lost mate.Hangover Part II? Well. They have a party. They wake up. One guy is missing. They start looking for him. Oh, a Chinese guy. A mix-up just when they thought they'd found the lost guy. ...Wait, wasn't that the first movie?! So if you don't mention Bangkok or the monkey, it's all pretty much the same.Didn't pay the movie ticket myself, so I didn't lose anything by seeing this. But would've been just a tad p**sed off if I had paid.",5,3,6,29 May 2011
Beauty and the Beast," Tale as old as time - and still you can screw it up.
","First I'll explain the 4/10 stars; an attempt was made with this movie. I could see the effort, but even if you make a cake and it looks pretty it doesn't matter if it doesn't taste like anything.So yeah, I'm one of those who got disappointed with this remake. I had read the reviews and seen the trailers, so I somewhat knew what I was stepping in to when I went to see this.I'm very much with the audience that has already stated the obvious; Emma Watson is lovely lady, but she's no Belle. I get that the writers wanted her to have some spunk in her rather than just be a bland miss goody-two-shoes, but Watson can't play it through. Just in one or two scenes she looks like she's about to grasp her role, other times she looks like she's just reading her lines out loud to her grandma. But it's not all her fault, the pointing finger goes almost entirely on casting and the director. I mean - what's with the awkward scenes? When the Beast is fighting off Gaston, the camera suddenly shows Emma gasping very theatrically. Like someone just shouts at her 'Okay Emma, now gasp like you're in a school play and you have to make it show all the way to the back row' - which she does, and it just looks silly.I mean.. There's so much wrong in a movie that should've been the best thing come out from Disney in ages. from start to finish this movie was pain to watch. All the awkward ball scenes in the beginning and end, well, at least the movie got to finish at the same dull feeling as it started.There were good things, too. Like the design of the castle. Dan Stevens singing his piece, which was nicely put together even though it wasn't a part of the original animation. The movie showed the Beasts' pain far better than animated version. We get to see the more dark side of Gaston's personality.I will never watch this again, this I will assure you. I'm sorry, Sir Ian McKellen, but even you couldn't save this movie - as magnificent as you are.",3,7,13,20 May 2017
Saving Mr. Banks," Can't shake the image of cat lifting its own tail
","This is a well-made movie - I love Tom Hanks and he does, again, an excellent job playing the role of the Big Man Disney.But then, this is a Disney movie. There's your problem. Mr. Disney is presented as a persistent savior, while Mrs. Travers comes out as a difficult & grumpy woman. Who, of course, learns to see how the Walt Disney movies can make everything magically right.As we say in Finland 'Who other would lift the tail of the cat instead of the cat itself' and somehow it fits with this movie. Disney is a smart brand making itself seem flawless & 'the good guy', and it's almost scary how well it does that.Don't get me wrong, I love Disney movies. But sometimes I can see past the painting and I don't like it one bit.",6,6,11,1 September 2015
Looper," Start of the movie: 7/10, End of the movie 4/10
","So the movie starts off with fairly interesting plot and messing around with time. When I was about 1/4 in, I was hooked and watching the film with a smile on my face, thinking 'Oh yeah, this is nice! And Bruce Willis, too! This might be a movie I'd want to see again.'But then, when the movie ends, my thoughts weren't anywhere near like they were in the beginning. More of 'Wtf, why should I care, okay what then?'. This felt like I had watched two movies - one starting off nicely and the other one ending like the writer didn't care either way if he could finish the movie or not.So... no. Would not watch this again. This movie left me feeling ripped off, cheated from a good ending and lured in with half-assed plot.",5,1,5,27 February 2018
Life," Not a masterpiece, but okay horror flick
","Now, I'm a huge fan of horror movies and have seen my fair share of sci-fi horror. 'Life' is definitely not in the top, not even close, but that said it's not one of the worst, either. Many of the latest reviews are making 'Life' seem like something you'd be better off without, but they clearly were expecting something more like 'Alien' (even though they're screaming they did not) and got pi**ed off when the two couldn't compare.Originality is far from 'Life', as are the characters and the plot. When you've seen as many horror films as I have, you learn to expect certain things to happen and you can usually pick out the least possible survivors. About half way of the film I predicted two possible endings for this film with the twists, and got it right.Acting is very mediocre, but the directing is something I found well done. The characters are very, very simple and roughly written, so don't expect to get too much out of them. A lot of the film was saved by the gorgeous CGI.My recommendation for this film is to watch it like you'd watch a late 80's or early 90's horror movie with updated CGI and special effects. Shut down about 40% of your brains, have some popcorn ready, forget about 'Alien' and you're good to go.",6,2,4,18 June 2017
Incredibles 2," Same old, same old.
","Writers: 'Let's see, what was teh plot for the first movie? Well, that worked well, didn't it? Let's make the same thing again - like, what's the use to fix something if it's not broken?'That's basically it. This movie. The main plot is just as the first one, but with at least some (predictable) twists. So don't expect any greatness from that, but still do expect enjoying the movie, because it's not bad.I liked the familiar characters with more life to their style due evolved CGI, I liked the odd jokes here and there, and also the character developement was done well. So the movie has many great aspects, but I would've hoped it to be more different from the first one. But hey- can't have it all. It's still a decent sequel.",7,1,2,2 November 2018
The Martian," A movie I could watch over and over
","I have few movies which I'd be perfectly fine watching over and over again. One of them is Apollo 13 starring Tom Hanks, and I'm so glad I can add The Martian to the list, right next to Apollo 13.Both the book and the movie exceeded my expectations with flying colors. In the past Matt Damon wouldn't have been my first choice for the role of Mark Watney, but I have to admit he did a brilliant job. Now I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Watney as he managed to bring through every emotion of a man who realizes he's alone on a giant red planet, and nobody knows he's there.But of course the best part of the movie is the story and the book behind it. The story could've gone so many different ways, but somehow it managed to do things just right. It makes you gasp, hold your breath and - sometimes - burst into laughter when you least expect it. The brilliance lies in the humor of Watney and how he handles the situation, even when it's more or less clear he's alone and all odds are against him.This here is a story of survival at it's best. Kudos.",10,1,2,1 September 2018
