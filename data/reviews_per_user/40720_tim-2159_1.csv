Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," You'll be pausing this film to wipe your tears!
","This is not a great film in the true sense of a movie, but as a 'fly on the wall'parody it is one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure to watch and cry with laughter. This film will have you in stitches if you like Trigger Happy TV and the likes of Team America World Police, why? because you will 'just get it' in a BIG WAY. It's a humour that the politically sensitive will not warm to, but if you, like me, can see through the 'apparant' racist humour (after all Sacha Baron Cohen is not exactly caucasian), then you are going to have a ball with this 'movie'. Rent it, buy it, just see this movie, but ensure that you have a box of tissues and a remote control nearby as to pause it, in order to take-in what you instinctively could not believe what you heard. And, yes, he did say that, and yes they did do that to the unsuspecting American public.",9,0,2,25 October 2007
