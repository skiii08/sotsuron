United 93," Almost TOO Real...
","I went to see this movie feeling that it was an important piece of cinema to see, as a means for people to make sense out of the September 11th tragedies and to understand that day from various perspectives. Personally, the core of the tragedy to me has always been the World Trade Center and while Flight 93 was certainly an enormous tragedy as well, I think more often than not of the twin towers as emblematic of Sept. 11th; Flight 93 somehow takes a back-burner in my mind. This movie certainly gives the lives lost on United 93 their due. Coming out five years after the fact, this movie is an important reminder of what happened that day, in spite of the wars and propaganda and emotional callousness built up over time. I say that this movie is almost TOO real because when watching it I was struck by the everydayness of the people on board the plane and the incredulity of the air traffic controllers when first confronted with the hijackings. Some of the actors in this movie aren't even actors; I read in one review that some of the actual air traffic controllers play themselves, and the lack of 'name' actors is an effective means of realism. This movie is shot shakily, as though with a hand-held camera, which gives it an even more authentic feel. While it plays out a bit like a Hollywood thriller, I had to keep reminding myself, 'This HAPPENED..this is real,' and at times that thought was overwhelming to me. I had to look away from the screen more than once and at one point leave the theater for a few minutes. It is different from some fictional thriller in that going in, you know the ending; there are no light moments in this movie and nor should there be. The film refrains from political commentary or subjectivity. I don't feel there was any sentimentalism portrayed whatsoever, as with some made-for-TV movies on the subject. While some might say any September 11th film capitalizes on a horrible tragedy, I think this movie treats the subject with utmost sensitivity and respect; my thought coming out of the theater held true with what I felt going in: this is an important piece of cinema. While difficult to watch at times, I am glad that I saw it. I don't want to give away any spoilers but one scene in particular affected me very much, as a reminder that regardless of race or religion we are all human, and there are certain commonalities we all share in that.",10,3,7,29 April 2006
