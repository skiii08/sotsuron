The Ring," Truly haunting imagery
","Not having seen the original, I can only comment on this film, which I thought was perfectly executed.  It was perhaps too strong for a mere PG-13 rating, as even my wife, who has grown to love horror films, nearly had to leave.A little cheesy at the beginning, perhaps, but otherwise flawless -- I've never seen a film do so much with simple images.  A chair, a ladder, a fly -- it left me fully, delightfully creeped out.  And discussions of perceived or hidden meanings will no doubt continue for a long time.",Null,0,0,28 October 2002
