Scarface," The Best Movie of All Time
","It seems fitting that I'm writing this review in December 2012. Thirty years ago Scarface was being filmed, and it only gets better with age.Everything about this movie is fantastic, and it all adds up to more than the sum of it's parts.Pacino, Bauer, Pfeiffer, Loggia and F. Murray Abraham all deliver fantastic performances.The soundtrack is classic 80's Giorgio Moroder, and is a predecessor to much of the dance pop of the 2010's (listen to Lady Gaga's 'Dance in the Dark' for comparison).I still want a silver Porsche 928 and a 1950's Rolls Royce and I still want to live in Frank's house on Key Biscayne.We all know Scarface as one of the most quoted movies of all time, some great examples are are: 'What you lookin' at? You all a bunch of f**kin' assholes.' 'You got a look in your eye like you haven't been f**ked in a month.' And my two personal favorites: 'Five hundred dollars. For a bunch of f**king grapes!' 'I gotta get organized.'Many will criticize it's flaws, but the fact that this three hour movie left this reviewer wanting more is a testament to it's characters and world building.",10,1,3,7 December 2012
