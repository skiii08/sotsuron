It," Pretty Good
","This movie is It meets Stranger Things. The movie was amazing and tons of fun. There are a few big jump scares from here to there, but overall it was a coming to age story. The kids were hilarious and amazing and each stood out in their own way. Stan, the Jewish kid, and Mike, the black kid, were pushed to the back burner. I think Mike had like six lines in the entire movie. The actor who played Pennywise was amazing creepy and scary. I also liked how even the adults in the movie were scary too. One guy I thought was It in the trailer was a regular character in the movie. I loved the actress who played Beverly because her storyline was the scariest because it was real life horror. And anyone with common sense knowing the movie was going to modernized knows what the writers changed with her storyline. I loved the cute little love triangle which was kid friendly. My only dislike was the kids' filthy mouth and constant profanity. I was able to show my nephew the original It as his Introduction to Horror because it was scary and clean without the dirty jokes. This one is laced with funny jokes that aren't appropriate for kids spoken by kids. I overall enjoyed this version as I did the 1990s It starring Tim Curry. Both are amazing but this It is only a different interpretation of the same story. This movie also has rewatchability like a fun horror ride at an amusement park you want to get back on to ride again and again. Amazing movie, great standout characters, great casting, great cinematography,and a creepy atmosphere. This movie is like going on an adventure you want to go on again and again. Yes, you can love the book, the original movie, and this version too. An amazing fun movie you will enjoy and think about the scary fun you had afterwards. It sticks with you like a great childhood memory.",10,6,15,10 September 2017
Get Out," Get out and go see this movie!
","I dragged myself to go see this movie because I thought it was going to be stupid or Wayans Brothers bad spoof from watching the trailer. But I was totally taken by surprise. This movie mostly drew out two reactions from me. One of laughter and the other of fear. Not like a slasher film like Halloween or Jason, but the atmosphere and music as creepy and haunting as the opening scene from the Shining. It's a different kind of fear. The fear of paranoia knowing something isn't right in your gut but you can't prove it because you can't see it but you can feel. I'll admit I didn't find the leading actor, Daniel Kaluuya who played Chris attractive at first and thought he'll be a buffoon in the movie. But I had to retract those feelings after first seeing his talented artwork in the opening scene, his well built body, his presence, his cute dog, his commanding voice, and his intelligence all kicked up the attractiveness of this man in my eyes. I won't spoil the movie because it is an experience you should witness for yourself. The less you know the better even though the movie has rewatchability and it's one of those movies that the more you watch the more you discover or pick up on. The entire cast was perfectly cast, the script was amazing, and Chris was a smart in how he handled situations. He was a smart character that you symphatized with and wanted to succeed and be happy. I think everyone's favorite character the TSA agent and Chris' best friend played by Lil Rel Howery because he represented us, the audience in the movie and constantly kept us laughing especially when the movie became serious at times. Jordan Peele did an excellent job with this movie. It's Who's Coming to Dinner meets Rosemary's Baby meets the Stepford Wives. As the ending credits rolled and I was leaving the theater and stepping back out in the real world, I was still creep out and paranoid. I love horror and comedy movies, but as I drove home I wondered what was it about this movie that creep ed me out. It was not scary like a good slasher film, but it was the atmosphere the movie created, the haunting music, and the paranoia. It finally dawned on me that paranoia I felt from watching this movie is how I feel like in real life simply being black in the world. I found out that Jordan Peele cleverly made a horror film about racism and turned something that is abstract into something that is concrete as a movie. I loved this movie and had a good time watching it. It didn't have me on the edge of my seat afraid, but some scenes were laugh out loud funny. Go see it if you haven't seen it. It is an experience and a movie like this has never been made before. It was very risky career move for the actors to make this movie, but the risk payed off well and the movie is amazing.",10,5,17,4 March 2017
Logan," Awesome Movie
","When I left out of this movie, I hated the ending. Then when I was driving home, I was still thinking about the movie and it hit me that the entire movie was excellent including the end. If you take Jackson's Wolverine from the beginning in 2000's X-Men to all his movie until 2017's Logan, it's the warrior's journey from dawn to twilight and the ending was a perfect fit to this great warrior and a perfect sendoff to the phenomenal Hugh Jackson who did an excellent job in portraying Logan with so many dimensions. I can tell he had a blast playing Logan over the years, but like Logan coming to terms with his mortality and Jackson dealing his numerous cancer scares over the years, it was time put the claws back in once and for all. I loved this movie. It had a very strong cast. There were no weak links. The little girl who portrayed Laurie was amazing. Not only did she kick-butt as a little Wolverine herself in some brutal action scenes, but she was able to emote so many emotions without speaking and you cared and sympathized with her character. My favorite scene was when she was eating cereal so calmly watching the bad guys on camera arriving to kidnap her. This movie was also a wonderful sendoff to Sir Patrick Stewart. I watched on the Graham Norton as he announced seating next to Hugh Jackson that this would be his last X-Men movie. He said it was perfect sendoff to his character and he was absolutely correct. I loved this version of Stewart and his father-son relationship with Logan who are like a father-son who obviously loved one another but constantly bicker with one another. Professor X, as I will always call him whether he runs the X-Men school or not, was awesome and his instability with his powers led to some of the best scenes in the movie. I even liked the Albino who took control of his destiny. The movie was excellent. Great script, great villains, great cast, great action scene, great storytelling, and scenes that will rip out your heart and shock you. You care about ever character in the movie even the minor characters. But I really enjoyed this movie and even as another pass, I still am thinking about how great this movie is. It is a perfect sendoff to Logan and Xavier. And yes, it is bittersweet but it was the perfect ending to great characters.",10,2,6,4 March 2017
Selma," Selma was an amazing, powerful uplifting movie!
","This was an amazing depiction of a moment in the life of Dr. King. I loved seeing this side of him because we like to make our great leaders like Jesus, Ghandi, and Martin L. King martyrs. This depiction made him human with human flaws.If anyone wants to see how Rev. Al Sharpton and Rev. Jesse Jackson got their activism style from,this movie will show it was from Dr. King.He met at the White House with President Johnson, you had J.B. Hoover threatened to take him out, the government wiretapping his phones, and Governor George Wallace doing whatever he could to stop him.He also knew how to used the media to his advantage and understood his mortality and his importance.The millenials, especially black youth need to see this movie so they can understand the importance of why it is importance to vote. What our ancestors went through to get the right to vote and how it was all political and about legacies. How he used the media to show the world what Black Americans went through for the simple right to vote. It is haunting how the images of 1965 are parallel to the bruality of the streets of Ferguson. How the boys killed in nonviolent marches reflects the unarmed black men getting murdered today by the cops today. I wasn't going to watch this movie thinking it was another The Help or Precious, but I was so wrong. It is very uplifting towards the African American community and is in the league of Spike Lee's Malcolm X, 12 Years A Slave, and now Selma. And the music took it to another level especially the ending song Glory performed by Common and John Legend and how Common tied the events of Fergurson today into the events of Selma. Anyway, I loved the movie. I recommend everyone to go watch it. It is a perfect example of how powerful we are when come together as one race regardless of our differences and skin color.",10,7,19,17 January 2015
Beauty and the Beast," Eh?
","If you saw the animated version, then you have seen this movie. It's the same as the animated movie only live action. There was absolutely no reason for this movie to be made besides as an easy cash cow for Disney cashing in on the nostalgia of fans of the original. This movie brings nothing extra to the table.It took no chances and pandered to feminists and LGBT members when it wasn't necessary. There was no need to make a big deal of the blink and you miss it gay scene. There was also no need to make Gaston's sidekick gay or in love with Gaston. As far as the ballroom scene, it wasn't as mesmerizing as the original. I'm not a fan of Beauty and the Beauty. It's not my favorite Disney movie, but I must admit the ballroom scene was a masterpiece by itself and the best part of the original. I think the movie should have taken a chance and used the concept of the moral of the story and use it in a new twist like the numerous adaptions of the Cinderella movies do from the cheesier ones to the better ones like Ever After or Ella Enchanted.I checked it out. I loved the ending especially the clock's reaction, which caused me to actually laugh. I really wish they did not CGI Dan Stevens' Beast. So it wasn't a bad movie, but you can't mess with perfection. Love or hate it, the original was a masterpiece and this one does not compare.",7,6,9,20 March 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," A Chick Flick for Guys
","This is a love letter to the fans who love action movies done right. Your prayers have been answered. Both John Wick1&2 is equivalent to a chick flick for guys. Beautiful scenery,locations, great action scenes that you can follow along and are not all shaky camera and choppy. The world of John Wick is breathtaking and amazing. You're dragged right back in the opening shot of the first scene. I love the fact that he actually takes time to reload the gun and he gets his butt kicks a lot and still fights. He's not a superhuman like Tom Cruise in MI movies or the Fast and Furious franchise. I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. The climax of course was seeing Morpheus and Neo reuniting on screen for the first time in nearly 20 years on the rooftop scene. I feel so bad for John wanting a simple life and being forced back into this world. There's one scene in the movie where John shouts that you wanted be back and now I'm back. And I wondered was that John talking to the antagonist or 50 something year old Keanu breaking the fourth wall and talking to us, the audience, for wanting this sequel so bad. And my goodness, Keanu, the writers, the directors, and the studio heard our prayers and created a movie that lived up to the hype of the original and complemented it perfectly. It wasn't too big or too small. It was just right and I think that a lot of times that successful movies sometimes forget the magic formula that made the original so special and overdo it in the second movie.The directors of JW2 did it exactly right. Can't wait until John Wick Chapter 3 is released so that we can give this man some peace. Definitely recommend.",10,6,13,17 February 2017
