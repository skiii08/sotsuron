The Avengers," AVENGERS - Home Run!
","Saw them all, Iron Man 1 & 2, Captain America, Thor, Hulk (both of them), and anticipated the arrival of the Avengers, and man, what a fun movie it was. Thought the way the set them all up was executed very well. Didn't really have a back story going into the movie about the Black Widow character, but her opening scene sufficed. Thought the 'Hawkeye' guy was a cool character but didn't really see how he was a super hero in a sense, if that makes any sense. Hulk, Captain America, Thor are definitely genetically super heroes, and Iron Man is by ways of modern technology, but come to think of it, Black Widow is just a real devastating woman who stands on her own and Hawkeye is also kind of just a guy that's a real good shot, but end of the day, they'd all be great back up if non-friendly aliens came down for a visit. Not wanting to give away the story, just like to add that the length of the movie didn't bother me at all, the character development and was loads of fun. Really enjoyed getting to know characters again.",Null,4,9,20 May 2012
The Hangover," So, so...could have been great
","Dude, show us the MONEY (shots). Lots of Talk about the crazy events and little show but a series of pictures during credits at end. I was hyped to see this movie. Not bad, but what it could have been. Shame Shame. Lost op on this one. Could have been a Classic. Would have really enjoyed seeing how they stole the cop car, didn't have to be an elaborate chase scene with 10 cars following close behind like a Tony Scott or Michael Mann picture, just something for us to latch onto that's all. Also would have enjoyed seeing why and how they were so crazy at the wedding chapel. What went down so unusual that the proprietor is totally beside himself of the night's (before) events. What did the guy with no tooth do that made the guy consider him the craziest m—f—he had ever met. A 10 to 20 second outrageous clip would have sufficed, but no, we were denied that also. And why not show us a flashback of how they were kids and how they did that sleeping bag trick on their friend. Why not spend a half a day and get a couple of kid actors and do that for us. Why all the talk about last night and not show us?",4,2,6,20 June 2009
Captain America: The First Avenger," Can relate
","I've been waiting for Captain America to come out so they can all get on with it, so we can finally get to the Avengers movie, but I have to admit, I really liked it. I think I fell in love with the lead girl immediately and probably because she liked Captain America a little even before he was big and buff. I related to Captain America as a kid. I'm not from Brooklyn, I'm a Texan, BIG DIFFERENCE! But I still could relate. I was a scrapper kid who never developed much like a lot of my friends, but I always gave it my best shot. I didn't know the history of the comic book, and that Captain America was a skinny little runt at first, and a product of a science lab. Seems like Steroids been around for longer than Schwarzenegger, and all this time I thought he was their poster child. I was wrong. It was Captain America! He was the original lab rat. Just the same, really liked the movie, especially the first act. Enjoyed the evolution of the super hero, the action in later acts was okay too.",Null,1,4,23 October 2011
RED," Malkovich steals it silently
","They're all great: Mirren, Willis, Freeman, but Malkovich just kills me with his little gestures. There was a scene with Dreyfuss that almost felt like Morgan Freeman was upset that Malkovich was there in the movie, stealing scenes with little effort. And a really nice surprise to see the like of Brian Cox and Mary Louise Parker. The main cop on the case did a great job (Urban?) and always nice to see the legendary Ernest Borgnine, I don't believe he's still in movies. How many of those guys are left that are still making appearances in movies? Martin Landau comes to mind. I'll probably send this review and then think of two or three more, but how many are still doing films? Bornine must be 90 years old by now. If you haven't seen RED yet, you should. It is obviously not realistic, like any movie with action, but hello! it's a movie, and a very enjoyable one at that. Great cast. Great supporting cast. A fun movie overall. It'll be a great rental. Don't know if there's room for a sequel, they'd need to bring in one or two additional 'pros' to make it work. Hopefully they'll leave well enough alone.",10,0,1,5 June 2011
