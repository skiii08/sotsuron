Alien 3," Internal Experience
","Alien 3 is an internal experience. It is real life. The innocent die at the most inopportune moments. Where do you go when you have lost everything? It is a question many of us have to face. Ripley has come full circle and she is well aware of her fate. All those who lambast this movie are simply not intelligent enough, or have not lived enough, to grasp the inevitable demise of our heroine. Thats not to say the film does not have its flaws. The studio interference is painfully apparent. The assembly cut is better but it could have been so much more. A fitting end to Ripley.....the only end if we be honest with ourselves.",9,2,5,30 May 2005
