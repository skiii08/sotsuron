Sucker Punch," Ambitious but terrible
","This film tried to get the audience talking like the brilliant inception and succeeded but for the wrong reasons. I found that only actress who can act in this film is Abbie Cornish which isn't really saying much. The only good thing about sucker punch is that it is visually outstanding, but that is not enough to keep me interested, even Nazi zombies which came straight out of call of duty couldn't keep me interested but Zack Snyder thinks women dressed as school girls will maybe if I was 12. Don't bother renting this out it is not worth it, even the 'twist' at the end is just stupid, that it would make M.Night Shymalan cringe.",3,2,7,10 September 2011
