Casablanca," Straight Up Gangsta!
","Favored among many movie enthusiasts, Casablanca is a well-made American classic. The film gives the audience a taste of the atmosphere that existed in Casablanca, Morocco during the Nazi regime of WWII. In the film, Casablanca is the destination for anyone who didn't want to be found. For the criminals, escapees and the refugees fleeing from Nazi oppression, Casablanca was not only a safe haven, but also a gateway to a Hitler-free world.There in Casablanca, exists a popular nightclub called Rick's, where most of these stowaways end up as they wait for their ticket out of the country. It's a trendy gin joint with gambling, music and drinking that ironically reflects the atmosphere of the country or 'safe haven' Rick originates from, America, 'The Land of The Free'. At Rick's, the only 'American' nightclub in Casablanca, people from all backgrounds and cultures are welcome to relax and hang out without being persecuted, prosecuted or detained. It retains the party atmosphere and indulges in the carefree lifestyle that America commonly depicts. But beneath it all, lies the underground network of allies made up of intrigue, meticulous scheming and corrupt officials. In the middle of this soup of deceptiveness and illegality is Rick, standing neutral and bold.Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is a man who stands alone and looks out for no one but himself. By holding onto that pitiless tough-guy persona he reveals to the crowd, he's able to hide emotion and stray away from heartache, which as the film progresses, takes the focus away from the romance and the Nazis and places it on Rick's struggle to redefine himself. Bogart's brilliant characterization harmonizes beautifully with the performance of the stunning Ingrid Bergman, who plays Rick's old flame Ilsa 'Kid' Laslo. Together this romantic duo set the screen on fire as the sexual tension mounts between them.Technically speaking, the film didn't use any groundbreaking techniques with the lighting, camera work, or sound. For this film in particular, simple was good. No special effects, innovative camera movements or directing methods generated an uncomplicated love story that the audience could easily focus on.With quotable quotes and original an story line, there is no wonder why this film is a favorite to many. It's perfect for anyone who adores a good love story. Certainly not one of the greatest films ever made, it is however, one of the most influential films ever made, which justifies its status as an American classic.",Null,1,3,28 May 2004

The Godfather," Straight Up Gangsta!
","Acclaimed as one of the best movies ever, The Godfather lives up to its title. It features a riveting story rich with all of the right ingredients like action, drama and suspense that make this film captivating and favored among the masses. Its enticing storyline, fluid camera work and graphic brutality are what tickle our voyeuristic senses. Beautifully crafted, this film exploits the money, power, violence and problems that make up the world of a New York City crime family.The plot of this film is thicker than the blood spilt by its characters. With five mob families, the film focuses on one, the Corleones who is headed by 'The Godfather' Don Vito Corleone. As the times change, so do the way each of the mob family's conduct their business. Once funded by gambling rings and political involvement, the head of another mafia family, Solozzo, proposes the shift to the sales and distribution of narcotics. With a minor grip on the majority of the power in New York City, Don Vito refuses to be involved with the narcotics business and encourages the other Dons to do the same. With the tension mounting between the Corleones, Sollozo and the rest of the five families, rumors of a full-scale mob war escalate to the breaking point and the Corleones seem to be alone. As the drama and violence intensifies, the film leaves the audience feeling sympathetic towards The Godfather and his family, as they struggle to retain the peace, but are forced to fight to the bitter end. Soaked in complexity, this film manages to keep a fine pace and does a commendable job of depicting a crystal clear story. Its slow beginning solidifies the base of the story and the characters involved, as it gradually intensifies to its climactic ending with a slew of turmoil, gunfire and bloodshed. The film's score is its other strong point, contributing the power and emotional elements within each murder scene it was paired with. Its vast array of brilliant characters gives the film its depth and backbone. The solid and believable acting from names such as Brando, Pacino and Caan, clearly draw the lines between the bad guys and the semi-bad guys and add to the film's artistic quality. From the composed and rational Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to the violent and temperamental Santino 'Sonny' Corleone, there is a character for any audience member to relate to, keeping them interested and strongly involved with the story.Although it contains a healthy dose of blood baths and brief nudity, this film is a cinematic work of art. Since its 1972 release, the film not only collected a handful of coveted titles such as, 'greatest movie ever made', but also accredited numerous amounts of praise from critics and the public. Like the sweet harmonies of a Vatican choir, all of this film's elements worked as one whole unit and flowed together to create one of the greatest visual masterpieces in American culture.",Null,0,2,28 May 2004
