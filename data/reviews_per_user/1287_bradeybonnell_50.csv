1st act creation and failiure and now Shelby is in chargeFight is great2nd act win Daytona and practicing and letting Miles drive3rd act the race and devastationCorporate greed ruining a pure momentNot a fan of Bale's performance as it feels like a caricature and not a real person at timesDidn't like how they had him constantly talk to the car while driving and those scenes would have been more powerful with silence and focusDamon gives a good performance and is someone who is easy to root forThe top brass at Ford felt unbelievably generic and no qualities that were unique and stood outFilm tries to be a rousing inspiration but falls flat at timesThe race scenes are filmed very wellThe ending is a bummer but it is real life and real life doesn't always go as plannedDialogue doesn't always connect and the direction is sometimes shoddyThe stuff with Miles's family works good and the first act of the film with the setup could have been cut down a bit to save time as this film does feel its lengthFilm is still well made overall and I'm sure will hit well with the typical audience memberFilm was just too by the number for my liking and didn't take any chances to liven this film up a bit",7,1,4,16 November 2019

The score and soundtrack was incredible
Every piece of the film leading up to the doppelgÃ¤ngers arriving is set up for the rest of the movie
Performances all around for a very good jarring at times but with reason
The ending hit hard and made sense everything that they talk about or show you in this movie has meaning and pays off later in the film to a great degree
Movie is intelligently crafted by Jordan Peele with a very interesting subject matter that you care about all the way through the film
Every character choice and characteristic has a reason for later in the film
Every scene has meaning and purpose behind it
The ending of the movie elevates the rest of the film
Strong visuals throughoutBad
Tone of film is inconsistent and didn't work at times
Jokes were fine until the doppelgÃ¤ngers arrive and they should've been abandoned for a more serious tone
Humor should have gone away from the impact of the severity of the scenes that we are seeing

Live in this mobster world though Franks experiencesLike the voiceover as Frank is telling us his storyGet insight into the inner workings of the mob and the TeamstersFilm remains interesting throughout but is much to long and slow taking away from the more impactful momentsLast third of the film is very good showing the death of Hoffa and Frank's life catching up with himFilm shows that these glorified villains all end up in the same place and most likely end up alone and afraid of what is to come of them for all the bad things they have doneSad seeing Frank all alone with nobody around him even though we have seen what this man has doneScore of the film is used very wellCinematography is very good, plenty interesting shotsWell written and directedActing is very good and the best part of the film helping along this very long run timeDe Niro, Pesci and Pacino all give Oscar worthy performancesWould recommend this film with the biggest drawback being the pace and lengthGreat opening introducing us to Frank Sheeran in a retirement home and voice over ensues about Franks story he has to tell, he's a hit man for the mobDe-aging technology is great, still move like old people though which is a bit distractingNice zoom in shot on Ray Ramano in court scene, plays Bill Bufalino an attorney and his cousin in Russell played by Pesci who is leader of the mobThis is how Frank gets involved in the Italian mobFrank beating up the store owner was funny because he looked like an 80 year old in a fight, real badFrank becomes more involved with the mob and even does a hit for Angelo Bruno, a leader of the mob, does more and more hitsLike when they introduce us to passing characters telling us how they were all killedRussell connects Hoffa to Frank, Hoffa head of the Teamsters Union, helped raise wages for many Americans and was seen as a heroJimmy gets close with Franks family and his daughter Peggy isn't afraid of him because he is helping peopleMob went to the Teamsters for loans as they didn't go to the banks and that's how they helped build VegasFrank says that the mob helped JFK get elected, Jimmy doesn't trust JFK as Bobby goes after him, trouble for the mob and JimmyLooks like Frank delivered some weapons to the Cubans at one pointFirst third of film starts slow and settles us into the world of Frank SheeranHoffa doesn't like Tony as he is making unions look bad and wants Frank to run for a local Union President of 326 and he accepts and winsFailed assassination attempt on Hoffa and Chucky helps beat him up in courtShows Jimmy and his team working the courts to get out of troubleHoffa is happy that JFK died and that ended Bobby going after JimmyJimmy still gets convicted of juror tampering and fraud and Fitz is in charge and is easily taken advantage ofTony gets arrested by the FBI for extortion and got 7 years where Jimmy is staying and attacks JimmyFrank is back with Russell after Hoffa goes to jail and has to kill Crazy Joe, like the voiceover hereJimmy is out of jail after 4 years with a presidential pardon and wants to take back his union from Fitz and TonyMeeting with Tony doesn't go over well and Jimmy wants to know if Russell will do something about him, Frank with Jimmy and RussellFitz and Jimmy start to feud for leadership of the teamstersEveryone at a special night for Frank and Big Tony tells Russell that Hoffa is finding a way to hold up their loans and Russell and Jimmy have a discussion about itRussell gives Frank a ring that only he and Angelo have, Frank is untouchable nowRussell tells Frank that Jimmy has to step aside and Jimmy doesn't take this well and says he can take them down if they come after himReally good scene with Jimmy and Frank at his ceremonyJimmy refuses to step aside and now he is in danger from the mobJimmy wants Frank at the meeting with Tony and Russell says he knows and that they aren't going as they have done everything they could for himGreat scene with Pesci and De Niro at breakfast telling him that Jimmy is done no matter whatFrank meets up with Sal and Chucky and they go pick up Jimmy and Jimmy feels safe because he sees Frank thereReally good stuff and tension built without any score in the setup of bringing Jimmy inJimmy walks in and instantly doesn't like what he sees and Frank shoots and kills him and then flys back to Russell all in the matter of a few hours, best moments in the film, Frank has to kill his friendJimmys disappearance is in the news and Peggy stopped talking to her father that daySee the guys that were with Jimmy incinerate his body, Jimmy has to kill Sal and it was because of bad infoNobody was convicted on Jimmy's disappearance and Chucky brought Jimmy to his death without even knowing itSee everybody going down for different things, Russell goes down, and Frank gets 18 yearsRussell dies and Frank gets outSee Frank as a brittle old man on his own with a dead wife and kids who don't want to be around him because of what he has done, then goes into an assisted living homeLast 30 minutes of the film is the downfallEveryone we have met has died except Frank, Frank doesn't feel anything for what he has doneReally

Act 3 - 8.6Tony's story arc was completed and worked very well. He finally settled down and got the family he always wanted. But inevitably sacrificed himself again but this time he didn't make it. Nice to see Tony interact with his father and have a final goodbye. Nice reunion between Peter and Tony. I liked the dynamic with Doctor Strange and Tony. Strange knew the only outcome in which they won was that Tony needed to sacrifice himself. So in the end Strange did choose the time stone over Tony.Cap traveling back in time to have that dance and kiss with Peggy was an almost perfect ending. They needed to meet at the bar they were going to meet at when Cap was going into the ice to have the most emotion impact. But still very good. Caps story is complete and has come full circle. Cap hands over the shield to Sam which I think was a nice touch. Old Cap was a great scene. Awesome when Cap using Thor's hammer.Didn't feel the emotions I should have when Nat sacrifices herself to get the soul stone. Nat would do anything to help her friends and that's what she did.I didn't like the Hulk Bruce mix that was going on. I'm not sure where his character will go from her, especially after losing Nat.Thor was enjoyable and funny but I did not like what they did to his character in this. At end of movie when he is fighting Thanos he has storm breaker which was stronger than the infinity gauntlet in the last film but he's getting his ass kicked when Thanos has no stones. That didn't make any sense. Looks like Thor is teaming up with the Guardians.Hawkeye turns into Ronin and I enjoyed him in this film and he gets a satisfying conclusion to his story.Ant man was enjoyable and constantly funny. Good to see other side characters.Captain Marvel was unnecessary in this film. When she teamed up with the social justice warriors it was the most forced and worst part of the film.Guardians of the Galaxy are all together again except for Gamora. It does look like Quill was looking for the time travel Gamora at the end of the film.Cool how they used time travel to revisit important parts of the Avengers lore. Looks like Loki could be alive now that he escaped at the end of the Avengers scene with the tesseract.Characters were strongly developed at this point so it is easy to invest in them. Movie was overall enjoyable and payed off the previous 21 films. Excited to see where they take the MCU from here. Movie had stakes and emotional weight, just not enough. I like how they used Thanos in the film combined with Nebula.I enjoyed the pairing they had in the film but wish we could have had the original core avengers all together a little more throughout the film.Effects were great. Makeup was very good. Cinematography was also very good. Dialogue was consistent for the characters throughout the film. Wish they had a little less humor to greater the emotional stakes.Movie did feel dull at points and did t carry the emotional impact it needed to take a scene over the top. Runtime at 3 hours didn't feel too long. Just wish they capitalized on some more moments to make them more emotional. Time travel being introduced to the MCU takes away all of the stakes in every future film. They can now undo anything that goes wrong.Overall a satisfying conclusion to a now 22 film story arc. Got time with every character and I logical conclusion to every character for that film. I would change a few things here in their to better suit my liking but the film did have weight to it and payed off in the end.",9,0,0,30 April 2019

Bad:Voiceover was out of place and unnecessary and unexplainedI get why Sharon Tate's story is there but for the story Tarantino was telling, her character was not needed other than for a bait and switch.

The film opens with a task that holds a personal connection that stays with you throughout the film and pays off in droves at the end of the filmBoth performances by MacKay and Chapman as very good and feel that these men truly care for each otherThis movie is one hell of a journey that is incredibly fast paced and you feel the urgency of the missionThat being said the film also finds the right places to take a few moments to deliver powerful, smaller emotional scenes which hit hardThe one shot gimmick fades away quickly as you are completely emerged in this film and the task at handStill beautifully shot and executed piece of film that is a technical achievementThe score in the first half of the film follows a ticking sound that is always driving the plot forward and keeps the tension highDialogue feels real and the direction is perfectMultiple memorable scenes that are some of the best of the yearThe death of Chapman's character comes as a shock and it hits very hard but is perfectly done to gain optimal emotion that pays off at the end of the film when Schofield finds his brotherThe shot of Schofield walking through the pillars to see a burning building and we see his silhouette is beautiful and then turns to horror as a man emerges from the side of the house and gradually charges our lead, amazing sceneSchofield's scene with the woman in the basement is intimate and personal and is a perfect moment of humanity in a terrible life or death situationSome moments had the potential to feel corny or be mismanaged but they never are, always executed to the fullest potentialLiterally the only fault I have with the film is when Schofield is being chased and should have been shot easily a few times but that is an extremely minor gripeThis is a near perfect film that hits emotionally and technically for an incredible experience

Great opening dinner scene introducing you to all the characters and you get a good sense of who they areLove how the movie jumps right into the aftermath of a situation leaving the audience to wonder what has just happened and who these guys areTim Roth does great displaying the pain and emotions he is feeling after being shotWhen Mr Pink arrives to the safe house more of the plot is revealed and you start to understand what is going onHas nonlinear storytelling which has become a Tarantino stapleEarly sign that Orange is a cop when White says 'ya cops' and looks toward the door where Orange is laying bleeding outsideWhite and Pink discuss the situation revealing more info about the characters and the plot detailsSmart and intelligent dialogue that doesn't bore you with exposition but makes it excitingPink and White realize that there is a rat in the midst and that the diamond heist was a setupThings get heated between Pink and White escalating the situation and Blonde arrives deescalating the situation at the start of the second actBlonde reveals that he talked to Eddie and he is on his way to the warehouse and Blonde shows Pink and White that he kidnapped a cop solidifying the fact that he is not the ratIn a flashback we learn about Blonde who's name is Vick Vega and is related to Vincent Vega from Pulp FictionEddie arrives at the warehouse and he is trying to do damage controlWhen Blonde is left alone with the cop we see how insane this guy is and understand his mindsetThe scene where Blonde turns on the radio and starts torturing the cop is incredible, it's playful while being intimidating and also shows how deranged the character hisOrange who has been passed out most of the movie for blood loss saves the cop when Blonde is about to set him on fire revealing to the audience that he is the rat by killing BlondeGreat scene between the two cops in an awful situationOrange reveals to the other cop that the whole plan was to draw Joe into the warehouse where the cops are waiting nearbyWe then cut to a flashback and learn about Orange's undercover missionI love how contained the movie is and how there are limited charactersThe flashbacks add to the characters but take away from the tension that is taking place in the presentReally like the scene where they receive their namesJoe finally arrives and reveals to the others that Orange is the rat who works for the copsThere's an awesome standoff between Joe, Eddie, White and Orange as White is protecting orange and they all get shotMeanwhile Pink leaves with the diamonds as he is the only one who probably isn't going to dieOrange then tells White straight out that he is a cop and this is heartbreaking to White who just went out of his way to defend Orange the whole movieFilm ends with White holding a gun on Orange and the cops coming into the warehouse firing not knowing who dies for sure but we have a good ideaI've seen this movie a few times now and the flashback scenes really do take away from the tension and mystery that is going on in the presentI understand why Tarantino does this though as it does develop the characters further but it's unnecessary when you could just do that in the present in the warehouseI still really enjoy this film but is doesn't hit as hard when you have seen the film a few timesThe dialogue is fantastic in this film and is a sign of things to come as we know know in Tarantino's careerReally smart the way Tarantino withholds info from the audience and slowly reveals it to the audience as the characters are learning about it at the same time in the filmTim Roth gives a great performanceMichael Madsen is unbelievably cool in this film and has some of the most entertaining things to do in this flashy roleMovie is pieced together well and there is only one time in a car scene where there is a bad edit where it cuts and Mr Pink isn't doing what he was doing in the shot beforeMovie exudes coolGreat soundtrackOverall really good movie that can still be enjoyed on multiple viewings",8,0,0,29 June 2019

Another great opening diner scene just like Reservoir Dogs with great dialogueSamuel L Jackson is incredible in his interrogation scene with the people who messed with Marsellus WallaceThen we leave Vega and Jules to see Marsellus Wallace paying off a boxer to lose a fight, Bruce Willis and then Vega and Jules show up with the suitcaseVega is going to be taking Mia, Marsellus's wife out on a date to keep her companyMovie jumps around a lot with a lot of different and unique charactersMovie takes you into the stylized world of crime and drugsTarantino makes a 50's paradise in the diner that Mia and Vega go toBuscemi as Buddy Holly cameoMia and Vega's diner scene is overly long and doesn't amount to much but the dialogue and dance scene are intriguing but overstay their welcomeWhen they get back to the house Mia finds Vega's coke and is ODing but is brought back with an adrenaline shot at the coke dealers houseThey both agree not to tell MarsellusUma Thurman has a great performance in this filmThen we jump to Butch, the boxer as a child and we find out his father died in the war and is given a watch by one of his fathers friendsTarantino never shys away from racist or vulgar language and it adds to the realism of the dialogue and charactersWe cut back to Butch as an adult ready for his fight and he doesn't throw it like he was supposed to and now Marsellus is going to go after himButch killed the other boxer in the ring and Butch doesn't seem too phased by itIt turns out Butch played Marsellus to get the fix out there so he could take in more money by betting on himself to win and he plans on running away to Knoxville with his winnings and his girlfriendScenes with Butch and his girlfriend last way too long and adds to the bloated run time but the main point his that his girlfriend forgot to pack the watch which is most important to him and now he has to go back to his apartment to get the watch where he will be in dangerVega is waiting at the apartment to kill Butch but is in the bathroom when he arrives and Butch ends up killing Vega insteadButch then sees Marsellus walking past him at a red light and runs him over in a great scene but Marsellus is okThey both arrive in a pawn shop where they are both now being held captive in a unsuspected turnThey get locked in some weird sex dungeon with two guys and a gimp and this is just truly an insane situation that is cinematic goldButch escapes and saves Marsellus and they kill both their captors in an incredible momentButch and Marsellus are now cool and on good terms and Butch and his girlfriend fleeThen we cut back to the Vega and Jules and it is revealed that there was a fourth man in the bathroom who also gets killed after missing every shot which is played off like a miracle that they survive, they then leave with the one black manVega accidentally shoots Marvin, the black guy in the head and they have to get the car off the road in another great and unsuspected sceneMovie is told in a nonlinear way which was innovative at the time, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn'tGoing back to the Vega and Jules storyline takes away the momentum they were building with Butch and Marsellus. Their story seemed finished and had run its course and don't think it was a good idea to go back, still a good but isn't neededThey call in the Wolf to help fix the situationBut this leads all the way back to the diner scene that started the movie which I will say is clever, the movie is pieced together well but could be hard to follow the timeline the first time aroundJules says he is out after all of this after they deliver the case to MarsellusWhen the robbery starts Vega is in the bathroom, there's a standoff for the case with Jules and the robbersAgain the scene just seems to drag on too long killing the tension, again still a good sceneJules lets them go after a long story about him turning a new leaf and the film endsI like the unsolved mystery of what is in the case
Dialogue of the film in smart and well written and fits the characters wellWell developed characters with a plethora of great performancesSome very creative situations that Tarantino creates giving the viewer quite a few memorable momentsThe biggest flaw of the film is that some of the dialogue scenes which is what most of the film is just run on far too longMovie probably would have been a better watch if they cut out 20 minutes or so and just got to the point of the scene fasterThis is my third time watching the film and this is easily the most I have enjoyed itCinematography was pretty good and there were some memorable shots like the trunk shotOverall well made film that is filled with memorable moments and dialogue that just drags on too long",7,1,5,30 June 2019
