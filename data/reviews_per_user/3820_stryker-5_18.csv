Vertigo," 'I Look Up, I Look Down ...'
","A retired cop is hired by a San Francisco shipping magnate to follow his beautiful wife, because she has been behaving oddly.  Scottie Ferguson begins to trail Madeleine, and finds himself powerfully attracted to the disturbed young woman ...    'Vertigo' was inspired by the French novel, 'D'Entre Les Morts' by Boileau and Narcejac.  Vera Miles was meant to play Madeleine, but she became pregnant.  Plans were already well advanced when Kim Novak stepped in, and the portrait of Carlotta Valdes which intrigues Madeleine is in fact a likeness of Miles herself.      Barbara Bel Geddes (Miss Ellie from TV's 'Dallas') appears as Midge, the artistic intellectual who once had Scottie but lost him.  Watch for her telling little glance when Scottie mentions their now-defunct engagement. Apparently, Hitchcock gave Bel Geddes minutely explicit directions on when to raise and lower her gaze ('I look up, I look down ...').  Midge will never regain her place in Scottie's affections and she knows it.  Twice in the course of the film she is referred to as his mother-figure, a role which she seems fated to adopt, against her own inclinations.  The character of Midge is left to wither on the vine.  Once Scottie gets out of hospital there is simply no room for her in the narrative, and we never hear of her again.    Midge's pet-name for Scottie is 'Johnny-o', and the strange truth is, Johnny-o is a sicko.  He carries a weighty burden of guilt over the policeman who fell to his death (shades of 'Spellbound'?) and he now suffers from vertigo, the camera lurching queasily whenever he looks down from any height.  This much-imitated Hitchcockian trick consists of zooming the camera in whilst simultaneously tracking back.  The custom-built church tower proved unsuitable for the lurch-shot, so the effect was achieved by filming inside a scale model (laid horizontally, incidentally).    Scottie's sickness is insisted upon from beginning to end.  Like a voyeuristic stalker, he pursues Madeleine obsessively, watching her from the shadows.  When he pulls her out of the Bay, he sits her in her car and clinches her like a lover, repeating her name over and over.  He neither calls an ambulance nor informs her husband.  Instead, he drives her to his apartment, undresses her, puts her in his bed and plays with her hair. Later, the way he accosts Judy Barton is threatening and inappropriate. Director of Photography Robert Burks lights Stewart's face from below for the disturbing moment when Scottie begs Judy to dye her hair blonde. Scottie spends an inordinate amount of his on-screen time sitting alone in his car, symbolically trapped in the bubble of his unhealthy sexuality.    The colour green is the emblem of Scottie's kinkiness.  Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) whets Scottie's sexual appetite by setting up his first glimpse of Madeleine in Ernie's restaurant.  Her gown has vivid flashes of green, and Scottie becomes fixated. She drives a green car, and Scottie pursues it through San Francisco's gridiron streetplan like satyr chasing faun.  When he sees the car again after his spell in hospital, he runs to it and physically embraces it.  When he spies on Madeleine in the florist's shop, the bright green counter occupies a quarter of the Vistavision screen. Bright green lawns outside the art gallery prefigure the central 'village green' of San Juan Bautista.  These are important sites which Scottie associates with Madeleine.  When he has her at his mercy, naked in his bed, he has on a revolting green sweater.  Madeleine gives in and agrees to accompany him on a date, and he gives a sick smile as he drives her through the lush greenery south of San Francisco.  The phallic sequoia trees are of the genus 'semper virens', translated by Scottie as 'ever green'.  Judy attracts Scottie like a moth to a flame when she looks out of a window, dressed head-to-toe in green.  It is when he sees her silhouette against the green-tinged net curtains that he knows who she really is.  His excitement reaches an unhealthy pitch when she emerges from the bathroom with blonde hair, the room bathed in ugly green light.    For a story so carefully prepared by Hitchcock and his writers, Coppel and Taylor, 'Vertigo' contains some major weak points.  Elster's ruse is unbelievably far-fetched.  To get the half-drowned Madeleine to his apartment, Scottie must have used her car and abandoned his own.  Is that credible?  And how come Madeleine is able to dress and leave in the few seconds it takes Scottie to answer the phone?  The coroner accepts as fact the suicide attempt near the Golden Gate Bridge, even though this evidence can only have come from Scottie, whom the coroner publicly disparages. Would Judy really be so foolish as to wear the necklace which gives her away?  The film's ending is too much to swallow.    Kim Novak is on record as saying that Hitchcock insisted on her wearing the grey suit, the exact same one that Scottie forces Judy to wear as he remoulds her identity.  Like Scottie, Hitchcock had a thing about aloof blonde ice-maidens (Hedren, Kelly, Novak) ...  Scottie quotes a Chinese proverb about remaining responsible for a life once you've saved it.  Did Hitchcock feel the same way about the Madeleine/Judy/Marnie girl to whom he had granted life?",Null,3,3,12 December 1999
Vertigo," Coitus Interruptus?
","In 'Death In The Afternoon', Ernest Hemingway goes into considerable detail concerning penile tumescence.  'To a man in that portentous state,' writes Hemingway, 'all objects look different.  They are ... more mysterious, and vaguely blurred.' Is this why, when Scottie Ferguson follows Madeleine into the graveyard, the scene is shot in soft focus?    Coit Tower is a recurrent phallus, standing proud against the San Francisco skyline.  When Scottie has the naked Madeleine in his bed, the Tower is plainly visible through his apartment window.  It is Scottie's insignia, and Madeleine uses it to navigate by ('it led me straight to you').  Whenever Madeleine is lost to him, Coit vanishes.  When she re-enters his life, the Tower reappears.    Churches are important, too.  The film's twin climaxes take place in the (equally phallic) church tower of San Juan Bautista.  In real life, San Juan has no tower - the one in the film is pure Hitchcock.  Churches represent mystery and a higher plane of spirituality, something to which Scottie cannot aspire, but they also symbolise the thing he fears most - geometry. In the graveyard, as he lusts after Madeleine, a church floats high above his head, up on the ridge.  Madeleine is dangerous.  When he gets out of his car outside the seedy McKittrick Hotel, a large neogothic church seems to fill the screen behind him.  His thoughts are on squalid sex, and he stands out as a dark brown silhouette against the church's complex geometry.  The repeated shot from inside the bulky arches of the San Juan colonnade remind us of the sense of permanence which is absent from Scottie's life.    Architecture is geometry, and the structures inherent in both have bothered Scottie ever since he saw the cop fall to his death against the severe perspective of the downtown buildings.  He fears order - hence the remarkable animated nightmare which marks his loss of mental health, and hence Saul Bass's haunting title sequence with its epicyclic spirals.  The Golden Gate Bridge is clean and spare, seemingly architecture-free, and it is associated in Scottie's mind with sexual arousal.  It was underneath the bridge that he first got to fondle Madeleine, and like Midge's new bra, it is cantilevered out without any need for struts or supports.  Scottie is one sick dude.",Null,2,4,12 December 1999
The Great Dictator," 'Any Brave Man Would Resist!'
","Adenoid Hynkel, a lowly soldier in World War One, rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of Toumania.  He creates an aggressive, antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache.  Sound like anyone you know?From the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort Europe to take up arms and defy Hitler and Mussolini.  Given that the United States in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it, and no strong desire to embroil itself in Europe's civil strife (remember, it was Hitler who declared war on the USA, not the other way round) it is surprising that Chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic.The story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides, and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly, humane, brave, etc., etc,  Chaplin is Hynkel, and he also plays The Jewish Barber, the little hero of the ghetto (The Tramp in all but name).  Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes the music and does the catering.In 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the Third Reich, and Chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight, but even by the standards of the day he gets Hitler badly wrong. A comedian and a sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel silly and hapless.  All this does is to humanise him.  When Hynkel the not-very-warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside-down aeroplane, he becomes endearing rather than despicable.  As dictator, he inspects his subordinates' technical innovations which don't work (the parachute hat, the bulletproof uniform etc.) and these passages are meant to make us think that the real-life Nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside.  In fact, Hynkel's regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery.In truth, Chaplin's day had already passed when he made this ill-considered polemic.  At heart, he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen (check out the humour, with gags like staggering up and down the street semi-conscious, or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings). The hero Schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of European decency against which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a Nazi.  Is it in any way believable that a Schultz figure (if such had existed) would say to the Fuehrer's face, 'your cause is doomed to failure because it's built upon the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people'?  And how does Schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto?  If he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt, why does he persist in wearing his Ruritanian uniform?  Chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age.  As usual, Chaplin thinks in terms of 'silent' comedy set-pieces, loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line.  There is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers, shaving a man to the accompaniment of Brahms, and the globe ballet (watch for the segment filmed in reverse).Paulette Goddard is the unremittingly perfect Hannah.  Just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice, and the jewish haven in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, so Hannah is quite literally too good to be true. Brave, defiant, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage.  'Gee, ain't I cute?' she asks, after the Barber gives her a make-over.  Too cute by far, is the answer. She doesn't come close to ringing true, because Chaplin has made her a caricature.  The 'wouldn't it be wonderful?' speech which Chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author - too wordy, too emotionally cloying.Jack Oakie is great as Napaloni, the fascist dictator of Bacteria. He brings a whiff of much-needed comic brio to the proceedings, but the film's underlying weakness remains.  If Napaloni is silly and ineffective, how can we fear him?  And anyway, the stuttering stop-start of the back-projected train is a fine Chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth.And where did the Jewish Barber acquire that immaculate Hynkel uniform?",4,15,44,12 August 2000
The Hustler," 'We Have A Contract Of Depravity'
","'The Hustler' is steeped in the seedy atmosphere of smoke-filled pool halls in the ugly urban hinterland of America. The Ames Billiard Hall is funereal in feel.  When 'Fast Eddie' Felson walks in with Charlie, his manager, Charlie remarks, 'These tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.'  The film is about the talented men who perform, but equally about the talentless predators who exploit them.  The habitues of the pool hall cling to the shadows.  They wince when a blind is opened and sunlight gets in.  A new hustler enters, and these vultures gather silently on the margins.Eddie is the youngster hungry for glory.  He and Charlie pose as salesmen and Eddie feigns drunkenness, hooking the punters by repeating an almost-impossible shot.  For all the slickness of the con, Eddie is impatient for bigger things.  He wants to challenge Minnesota Fats, the best hustler in the land.Newman gets his name above the title, but this is a film with four exquisite pieces of acting.  Jackie Gleason as Minnesota, Piper Laurie as Sarah and George C Scott, playing Bert Gordon, turn in wonderful performances.Eddie matures as the story progresses.  He starts as a cheap chiseller, hustling ten bucks, but ambition carries him to Louisville and the world of the high rollers.  Sarah's love opens emotional dimensions in him which he previously lacked.  Bert Gordon confronts him with his own spiritual inadequacies, forcing him to understand himself.  Eddie is jejune in the first game against the Fat Man, but by the second meeting he is emotionally strong, and completely his own man.  He has made the spiritual journey from the whining 'everybody wants a piece of me' to the inner knowledge that Sarah bequeathed him - that only those who give can truly live.Bert Gordon, with his dark glasses and hawkish features, is a creature of the night.  Loving the 'action' of a clash of talents, but lacking any talent of his own, Gordon is the predator on the sidelines.  Hearing of the new hustler's presence, Gordon arrives soundlessly and sits watching intently for hours.  His dark genius sees the weakness in every soul.  In the bar, when he and Eddie talk business, Gordon is foreshortened to look tiny alongside the talented youngster.  For all his money and sharp wits, Gordon will never be more than a parasite living off the ability of others. Finally, Eddie and Fats walk into the sunlight, heroes who have proved themselves.  Gordon remains perched on his gloomy barstool, a prisoner in his own dark kingdom.If Sarah is the vulnerable, physically-disabled woman who relies on drink too heavily, the victim of the men she encounters, she is also the heart of the movie.  She destroys Gordon's certainty and she shows Eddie the meaning of love.  Her tragedy is Eddie's salvation.  She and Eddie find each other in a deserted bus station in the dead hours.  They are both lost souls, Citizens of Hell.  She is the deformed girl with the empty life, and he is the emotional cripple with no resources of education or character to sustain him.  They cling to each other  as if shipwrecked.  When the seduction comes, Sarah hesitates.  She knows this will lead to suffering. 'Why me?' she asks, then surrenders to her fate.The time when Eddie's hands are in plaster is Sarah's brief season of happiness.  She stops drinking and even makes progress with her writing. Somebody needs her, belongs completely to her.  It cannot last.
'I made you up, Eddie,' Sarah tells him, and in a sense she did.  She imagined him to be loyal and stable.  On the night when the truth dawns, Sarah goes from feeling pretty in her new dress to being a rain-sodden wreck.  She is supplanted in Eddie's attention by the sinister Gordon, who asserts the new power-balance in the railroad dining-car.  The hotel suites are adjoining, and though Sarah closes all the doors, she can't keep Gordon out.  By Findlay's party, she has hit the bottle again.  The patterned dress which Eddie bought her, a symbol of her incarceration, has the shadow of the ballustrade projected onto it, seemingly magnifying her sense of ensnarement.Though Jackie Gleason does very little in this film, he dominates it. On screen for a fraction of the film's totality, and having neither great speeches nor grand gestures, he impresses by his sheer presence.  Stillness, self-containment and an ironic amusement make Minnesota Fats the perfect foil for the angry, ambitious Eddie.  In the final showdown, Fats' quiet poise outshines the grandstanding of the others.  Gleason conveys beautifully the fear at the core of this big dandy.  When Eddie has him in trouble, the Fat Man begins to lose his sartorial integrity as his confidence unravels.This contrast of stillness and motion is effective in the first meeting of the hustlers.  Fats and Gordon, who know what they are about, remain motionless and tranquil.  Eddie the incontinent wannabe gradually loses control of both mouth and limbs.  The film is rich in symbolic language. The cheap rooms which Eddie rents are mere boxes for hire, like the bus station locker which he lives out of.  When he and Sarah meet for the second time, the inevitability of their coupling is conveyed in a scene without words or gestures.  Eddie's plastercasts are manacles - without his hands, he is nothing.  A sumptuous restaurant and a happy couple are transformed when the brutal truth emerges.  The camera angle is reversed, and Eddie and Sarah are now separated by gaunt shelves of crockery.  The illusion has been shattered.  When Eddie sneaks out on the sleeping Sarah with the stake money in his hand, it is the betrayal of Charlie re-enacted.A marvellous film is enhanced by a superbly sleazy jazz score (Kenyon Hopkins) and the violence is all the more gut-wrenching for being suggested, rather than shown.Verdict - probably a masterpiece.",Null,187,230,16 January 1999
A Bridge Too Far," 'It's All A Question Of Bridges'
","'Quite frankly,' observes 'Boy' Browning, 'this kind of thing's never been attempted before.'  But it has.  In 1962, 'The Longest Day' gave the epic star-studded treatment to the D-Day landings, and here we are, 15 years on, doing the same for the Arnhem debacle.  It has to be said, the film looks great.  From the gently-tinkling light fittings in the Dutch resistors' home to the beauty of the tank tracks in perspective, this is a gorgeously-photographed movie.In 1944, the German armies were being pushed back across the Low Countries.  The Allies' great strategic problem was the Rhine, the wide river which formed Germany's western border.  A daring plan was conceived which would overcome the Rhine obstacle and open the road to Berlin. 'Market Garden', as the plan was codenamed, involved parachuting spearhead units onto the great bridges over the Rhine and securing them for the critical few hours it would take for an armoured column to drive up and relieve them.It is easy now to point to the flaws in 'Market Garden', but at the time it looked like a daring and viable alternative to slogging it out against the Siegfried Line.  No-one had anticipated that the Dutch people would pour out onto the streets in throngs, thinking that they had been liberated, and thus bog down the armour.  The intelligence indications of heavily-equipped German units in the zone were ignored because they were inconvenient.  Critically, the plan allowed for only one solitary road to be available to the Irish Guards for the all-important northward thrust.  The film illustrates very effectively the way in which a plan can develop its own momentum, regardless of the shortcomings which riddle it.The sequence of the boarding and dropping of the paratroops is a thrilling spectacle, shot on a colossal scale.  The German ambush which delays the rolling of the armoured column is another terrific action sequence.  Attenborough keeps tight control of a big, complex story, and interlards the large-scale stuff with 'human scale' passages, like James Caan's rescue of his buddy (incidentally, the tracking shot which follows his jeep through the forest is quite remarkable).The fighting at Nijmegen is brilliantly-filmed.  Note how the street on the British side grows increasingly littered with war debris as the battle rages.  Robert Redford's assault across the river is a symphony in olive drab, leading to a wonderful moment of exhilaration.Whether the viewer finds the singing of 'Abide With Me' moving or grossly sentimental will depend on personal taste, but the subdued ending is very satisfying.  'Market Garden' may have helped shorten the war and may have achieved most of its immediate objectives, but it has to be seen as a tragic mistake.The film is slick, professional and very pleasing on the eye.  One can't help wondering, however, if this kind of 'tank opera' was worth the effort, given that 'The Longest Day' had done it all so splendidly a generation earlier.",Null,95,124,14 February 1999
Full Metal Jacket," 'What Are We? Lost?'
","This is a remarkable film.  It could be described as two films - the Boot Camp story of a 1967 draft of marine recruits, then the entirely separate tale of marines in combat in Vietnam. It is a film about disorientation, about struggling to make sense of the senseless: Private Pyle flounders hopelessly and never gets into the Marine Corps mindset, then later Joker and the others lose their way in the weird wonderland of war-ravaged Hue.  These failures to comprehend are metaphors for America's national bewilderment.With its first image, the film seizes our attention.  Recruits are having their hair shaved off.  We watch young men being stripped of their individuality while an incongruous country tune extols the war effort. Country music is inaccessible to these boys, appealing as it does (in 1967, anyway) to an older generation, and the song's unquestioning patriotism is at odds with the sentiments of many youngsters scooped up in the draft. This clash of opposites, and its resulting confusion, will be a recurring motif throughout the film.The drill instructor (Lee Ermey) transcends the stereotypes to give us a bravura performance.  This cruel, foul-mouthed monster is, paradoxically, admirable and very funny.  That the infliction of such misery should provide a string of belly-laughs is central to the film's purpose.  Our objectivity is impaired because we are both attracted to and repelled by Sergeant Hartman.Kubrick was famously uninterested in actors.  His concerns were always the wider ones, the movement of events which sweeps the humans along.  It is 20 minutes into the film before anybody speaks as a person (as opposed to a military automaton).  If the culmination of the Boot Camp saga is a little too sensational, it is certainly well depicted.  The sense of loss and foreboding carries us forward to Vietnam.Private Joker (Matthew Modine) is now a journalist in the Marine Corps, another instance of dislocation - he must both fight and comment on the fighting.  His habit of slipping into 'John Wayne' has its significance - he retains an ironic perspective on the USA's war aims, but is also very much involved in doing his bit at the sharp end of the war.The Tet Offensive has stuttered into being and died.  The Americans seem to be reasserting control in 'their' Vietnam, but in reality the death-blow has been delivered to American morale. Marines will continue to fight and die, but henceforth this unwinnable war will be in its endgame.  The nightmare panorama of Hue symbolises the quagmire of the war, as does the lone sniper who pins down a Marine unit with ease: the big military machine is powerless against its tiny adversary, and nothing makes any sense.The ancient capital city of Vietnam, Hue was of enormous psychological importance to both sides in the conflict.  Its position close to the DMZ made it a barometer of the war's progress.  The communists captured and held it during 'Tet', a devastating blow to the South's credibility.  The clearing of the city by the Americans was a laborious, long drawn out affair.The Hue of the film is astonishing.  These scenes were filmed in London's derelict docklands, out of which Kubrick has created an entirely convincing 'nowhere', an eerie tangle of shattered concrete which burns - literally - like hell.  The marines cannot find their way through this meaningless wasteland, another symbol of the national loss of proportion and purpose.  Striding back out of this gloomy moonscape, the marines sing the Mickey Mouse Song with gusto.  It is hard to know whether the grunts are being ironic about American values, or whether this is just another symptom of the crazy disorientation everybody is undergoing.A lot of films have taken us through Boot Camp, sounding off about comradeship, self-discovery and the American Way of soldiering.  A lot have tried to deal with Vietnam, but none has succeeded in providing palatable conclusions.  For me, 'Full Metal Jacket' will stand the test of time, because it alone captures the disorientation which is at the core of the Vietnam experience.There are many like it, but this one is mine.",Null,0,0,31 March 1999
The Godfather: Part II," 'You Can Never Lose Your Family'
","Here you have the supreme example of a sequel which eclipses its original.  'The Godfather Part II' is a majestic tragedy, operatic in its sweep, gigantic in its architecture and a stand-alone masterpiece in its own right - but a film which also amplifies and explains the film which went before it.  In the closing reverie sequence, the superbly-staged flashback, we finally understand what has driven Michael Corleone and why he has so persistently humiliated Tom Hagan.Several narrative threads are embroidered into Michael's story.  The scene shifts neatly from Sicily in 1901 to New York in 1917 and 1941, and to Nevada and Cuba in 1958.  The period detail is nothing short of wonderful. The vendetta is enacted in the exact same locations which featured in Domingo's 'Cavalleria Rusticana'.  Same streets, same theme.Brooding ominously over everything is The Family.  Many of the characters try to escape its clutches - Connie, Kay, Fredo, Frankie Pentangeli - but The Family is all-powerful and its reach is long.  Michael was Don Vito's favourite son, and this is more a curse than a blessing.  The college-educated marine officer expected and deserved to carve out a destiny for himself, but The Family had other plans.  Chosen by fate to be the new Don, Michael succeeds brilliantly but also succumbs to despair as love eludes him and paranoia sets in.  'You wanna wipe everybody out?' asks Tom. 'Just my enemies,' answers Michael - as he plans the death of his own sibling.  By the end, Michael's very existence is surrounded by, and predicated upon, death.Tom Hagan is the non-Italian who has, through loyalty and intelligence, risen high in The Family.  The Corleone lawyer and majordomo, Tom can always be relied upon to be calm, efficient and discreet.  Robert Duvall was rightly accorded second billing after Pacino for his fascinating, understated performance.  'Tom isn't going to sit in with us,' Michael tells Johnny Ola, and we see Tom masking his surprise at this humiliation.  At one point he asks directly, 'Why do you hurt me, Michael?'  For this man, the consummate staff officer, to ask such a thing shows the depth of his pain. At the very end of the film, Michael's desire to wound Tom is explained.'I intend to squeeze you.  I don't like your kind of people,' says the brash Senator Geary as he bargains over a corrupt gaming licence.  Later, The Family rescues him from a deeply compromising situation and the Senator becomes yet another Corleone bagman, speaking in defence of Michael at the Senate hearings.  The sunlit frivolity of the first communion party outside jars nicely with the dark dealings inside the tenebrous house, underlining Michael's remarks to Geary on the subject of hypocrisy.Pacino is hugely authoritative as Michael, and carries much of the credit for the film's triumphant success, but it has to be said that Robert de Niro is astonishing as Don Vito.  He grows in assurance as he ages before our eyes, and combines the human decency and the cold ruthlessness which are both the hallmarks of Vito Corleone.  De Niro achieves all of this whilst marvellously and uncannily reproducing the mannerisms of Brando's creation.Fredo is the weak brother.  Lacking Sonny's cheerful brutality and Michael's gravity, he is passed over for the succession. The Rosado brothers manipulate him and make a traitor of him.  John Cazale plays him beautifully as the nervy malcontent who feels he should be the Don, but who is given the whorehouse jobs.  By the end, Fredo has regressed into a childlike state, fishing with the kids and tearfully grateful for being allowed into Michael's presence.The Fanucci sequence is terrific.  1917 comes to life for us as a crowded New York street scene transforms into a theatre interior.  We see a Neapolitan bel canto performance reproduced faultlessly.  This story-within-a-story explains Vito Andolini's rise to prominence with pace and historical imagination.  Similarly, Cuba on the eve of the communist takeover is brought vividly to life on the screen.  We share Michael's growing sense of unease as the Batista regime unravels, and it becomes clear that Fredo has betrayed The Family.  'Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer' is Michael's motto, and we see him put this to devastating effect with Fredo and Hymie Roth.For all Michael's success as a leader, he fails his wife Kay (Diane Keaton) and his private life is barren.  Kay has to be protected from The Family's enemies, but to her it feels like a claustrophobic imprisonment. Things have gone badly wrong by the time of Michael's return from Cuba (he has to be briefed on which Christmas present he has 'given' his son).  A richly emotional chiaroscuro scene with his mother brings Michael to admit that he has lost Kay's love.  She is the loser, becoming inexorably estranged from The Family and from her own children.  Michael symbolically obliterates her by closing the door in her face.In the shifting sands of gangland treachery, it is hard to be sure who has double-crossed whom.  Did Roth deceive Michael, or is Michael now hopelessly paranoid?  What was the truth behind the bungled whacking of Frankie Five Angels?  One reality emerges from the chimera.  The Family alone is strong, and it crushes mercilessly those who fall victim to it. Even Don Michael.",Null,0,0,26 February 1999
The Caine Mutiny," 'I Kid You Not - The Greatest!'
","Life aboard a warship in wartime is tense.  If a captain starts to show signs of extreme eccentricity, what is his subordinate officer supposed to do?  Obey orders, no matter how ludicrous, or damaging to ship's morale? Continue to respect the captain's rank, while despising the man?  Article 184 of the US Navy Code (in 1943, at least) provided for a subordinate to relieve a commanding officer against the latter's will.  However, the tiniest error of judgment in invoking Article 184 would render such a course of action nothing less than mutiny ... and mutiny is a capital offence.    Newly-commissioned Ensign Keith (Robert Francis) is a blonde, athletic, all-American boy who believes in the Navy and wants to do well.  He is dismayed to learn that he has been assigned to the USS Caine, a rustbucket minesweeper with an unkempt, ill-disciplined crew.  To make matters worse, the quirky Captain De Vriess takes against the new ensign.  Oddball skipper and oddball crew love each other, and Keith despairs of ever seeing the Caine ship-shape.  When De Vriess is suddenly replaced by Lieutenant-Commander Queeg, young Keith assumes that his troubles are over. In fact, they have just begun ...    Humphrey Bogart is memorable as Queeg, the urbane martinet who goes to pieces under the slightest pressure.  It did not often fall to Bogart's lot to play weak men, but here he shows that his repertoire is large and varied.    The true star of the film is not Bogart, or even Jose Ferrer as Greenwald, the sharp lawyer.  It is Van Johnson, playing to perfection the part of Steve Meryck, the ideal officer.  Not especially bright or mentally flexible, Meryck is none the less a diamond of a man, reliable in a crisis, firm but fair with subordinates, a man to whom integrity comes as naturally as breathing.  Pulled one way by his strong ethical sense and innate loyalty, and in the opposite direction by a desire to protect his ship and his crew, Meryck's tormented conscience is the heartland of the film. Johnson is utterly believable as this decent but limited man.  As the seeds of doubt begin to germinate in his mind, the mutiny takes shape.  Two great symbols mark the climax of the story - firstly the storm at sea which represents the emotional tempest on the bridge of the Caine, and secondly Meryck's wrenching of the controls from the 'frozen' hand of the skipper.    A great cast includes Fred MacMurray as Keefer and Lee Marvin, graduating to speaking parts, as Meatball.  Keefer is the ironic, detached intellectual who shows his true colours under pressure.  Marvin is Marvin, and we wouldn't want him any other way.    The scene in which the trio of proto-mutineers visits Admiral Halsey's flagship is a feast for the eyes in a film strong on visuals.  The massive carrier looms over the tiny launch, emphasising the moral authority of the Navy and the tenuous nature of the mutinous enterprise.  The colourful deck parade is not only visually pleasing, it underlines the eccentricity and unimportance of the Caine.    Several aspects of the court-martial fail to ring true.  Lawyers do not order their clients to plead in a certain way - it is the client who instructs the advocate.  The order in which the witnesses give evidence may contain a certain dramatic logic, but it makes no legal sense at all. Greenwald tells Queeg all about a document before asking the witness to identify it, and makes points in cross-examination which should properly be left until his closing speech.    Edward Dmytryk, one of the blacklisted 'un-American' directors of the McCarthy era, put together in 'Caine' a motion picture of outstanding quality.  The strong Max Steiner score includes the jaunty Caine theme. Real-life combat footage is seamlessly spliced into the amphibious landing sequence.  Perhaps the shipboard drama needs the change of air provided by the Yosemite interlude, but I for one found the love interest to be ... well, uninteresting.  Apart from this, the Stanley Roberts screenplay is strong, drawing as it does on both the Herman Wouk novel and the subsequent stage play.    The intense close-up of the sick man as the crack-up begins, and the haunting rattle of the ball-bearings, are powerful dramatic devices.  The up-beat ending stresses the continuity of Navy life and the inherent resilience of the American Way.    Great stuff.",Null,1,1,25 January 2000
American Beauty," 'I Know I Didn't Always Feel This ... Sedated.'
","Hmmm ... Let's just take a cool, objective look at a few of the comments made by IMDb users who have reviewed 'American Beauty'. 'Haunting.'  'Riveting.'  'Brilliant.'  'More than meets the eye.' 'Uplifitng.'  'Never contrived.'  'By far the best I have ever seen.' 'Makes you think.'  'Exceptional.'  'Never gives stereotypes.'  'Classic masterpiece.'  'Movies don't get any better than this.'     And that list is by no means exhaustive.  Now let's contemplate the actual film that these people have been watching.     Lester Burnham is Suburban Man.  An unremarkable individual not valued by his employer and ignored by his family, he has wasted his entire adult life by succumbing to the routine of work and home, and failing to indulge his own individuality.  When two key events coincide (the loss of his job and the dawning of a 'crush' on his daughter's friend) Lester is suddenly free to 'beat his drum', slough off years of conformity and be his eccentric self.     Yes, that's right, yet another dull, cliche-ridden suburban situation comedy hinting at inchoate unease deep in the soul of bourgeois America. All the predictable bases are touched during this smug box-office home run - petty snobbery, keeping up appearances, repressed yearnings for Bali Hi, and that profound American lament, 'I've Never Been To Me'.     And what does Lester do to express his newfound rebellious individuality?  How exactly does he challenge the suburban world which he has rejected?  Form a witches' coven?  Invent a world language?  Assassinate Castro?  Reproduce indian cave art using bison dung as paint?  No.  He drinks beer in front of the TV set, and gets a job in a hamburger joint. Can America's big-budget Dream Factory come up with nothing more exciting than this?     Before dealing with the wider themes, I would like to tackle some details which bothered me.  What is a gun doing in this story?  Are Hollywood's screenwriters so bankrupt of ideas that they can't construct a plot without relying on the dreadfully-overworked device of pistol-packing? The opening shower sequence was embarrassing.  Adult jokes are fine by me, bawdy humour is great ... but this was unnecessary and degrading.  It simply didn't belong.  A narrator who announces that he is dead isn't a clever touch, it's just sloppy work.  Is Mena Suvari REALLY the embodiment of American beauty?  I find that hard to believe.  And what about the total loss of nerve surrounding her character?  Isn't this brash film supposed to be proud of its handling of adult issues?  So why does the temptress have to be revealed as a trembling little virgin?  We hear a great deal of American trumpeting of feminism as a cause.  Can't anyone see that this moral cave-in is profoundly anti-feminist?  On a similar note, what was Thora Birch's topless shot all about?  It defines the term 'gratuitous'.     And so, back to the broader picture.  'American Beauty' isn't any of those amazing things that people have claimed it to be.  It isn't even mediocre.  It's a tired, self-satisfied, deeply unimaginative rehashing of a format which was outworn by the time 'My Favourite Martian' hit the TV screen.  Challenging the regularity of suburban life isn't clever and isn't funny.  It is gut-achingly DULL.     The question which arises, then, is why so many people are sincerely convinced that 'American Beauty' outshines 'Citizen Kane'.  I offer this for consideration ... they feel that way because they are told to.  It doesn't work every single time, and sometimes it misses spectacularly, but Hollywood knows that as a general rule, advertising pays dividends.  Tell people often enough that they need to see this mighty film, and they will accept the premises - both that they need to see it, and that it's mighty.     Barnum said that nobody ever went broke by under-estimating the public. There's truth in that.  Just provide the bread and the circuses, and the docile populace will take you at your word that the bread is delicious and the circuses thrilling.       The public wants what the public gets.",Null,3,4,26 January 2002
1941," 'Maybe Somebody's Got A Use For It ...'
","Ned Beatty, Lionel Stander, Toshiro Mifune, Robert Stack, Slim Pickens, Elisha Cook ... the movie veterans line up and sleepwalk through this alleged comedy.  The 'Saturday Night Live' ratpack are here, too.  Belushi does his nutty slob and Akroyd does his voluble mock-hero, all to little effect.  It is as if Spielberg was out to prove a point, the point being that he could make an out-and-out comedy with directorial lightness of touch.  If knocking people down, spilling things and blowing things up is funny, then some people might think he succeeded.  I don't happen to be one of them.    The setting is the USA's West Coast at the outbreak of World War Two, and febrile American preparations for an anticipated Japanese attack.  It all begins with a 'Jaws' joke, Spielberg's attempt at self-referential satire.  There are nods in the direction of 'The Battle Of Midway' and 'Tora! Tora! Tora!', and Robert Stack's General Stilwell even calls to mind his garrulous pilot in 'Airplane!', but in truth the film is weak on witty quotation and strong on punching people and destroying property.    In fairness, some of the visuals are impressive.  Planes flying low over night-time Los Angeles are a joy to watch, and the mayhem in the paint factory is a riot of colour.  The jitterbug scene in the dance hall is well done, as is the collapse of the house.    For all the visual pyrotechnics, though, the whole project remains grounded in weak, mindless jokes which even an audience of teenagers (at whom this was clearly aimed) would consider to be beneath it.    Verdict - Maybe somebody's got a use for it...  I certainly haven't.",Null,0,2,25 December 1999
The Elephant Man," 'This Immeasurable Kindness'
","It is historical fact that in Victorian London a man came to light whose head and body were so appallingly mis-shapen by fibrous growths that he was frightening to behold.  This unfortunate man, John Merrick, could never hope to live in society, and was forced to endure a wretched existence as a fairground exhibit - the 'Elephant Man'.  Merrick came to the attention of a surgeon, Frederick Treves, who rescued him and helped him reclaim his human dignity.  This true story is the subject of David Lynch's astonishingly powerful film.       The 'look' of the film is a tour de force of sheer brilliance.  Not only are the images aesthetically resonant and horribly beautiful, but they also reinforce (and even shape) the film's very meaning.  In a recent TV interview, Lynch explained his choice of monochrome for 'The Elephant Man' by saying, 'Some movies cry out for black and white.  Black and white removes you from reality and you can drift into another world.'  It certainly holds true in this case.  Veteran cinematographer Freddie Francis has worked miracles, recreating 19th-century London as if old engravings had been brought to life.  Lynch and Francis have set about composing an essay on the grotesque.  Two whores fight in a pub, their faces distorted by rage and injuries.  The operating theatre, with its bizarre stands and clamps, is a parody of a factory, little more than another Victorian processing plant. Lamplight casts tortured, exaggerated shadows.  The band of carnival freaks who liberate Merrick constitute a monstrous procession of deformity as they escort him to safety.  And the purpose of it all?  To descant on Merrick's own distorted form, and to comment on the Victorian psyche, with its morbid interest in the grotesque.     Bytes, the fairground 'owner' of Merrick, gives out a story to the paying public that Merrick's mother was attacked by an elephant during her pregnancy.  The film begins with disturbing images of toplit elephants in a black nothingness, a woman in the throes of childbirth, and a close-up of the portrait of his mother which Merrick keeps with him at all times.  From this nightmare we move into the organised nightmare of the fairground, where people pay to be frightened.  A board near Merrick's cage reads 'The Fruit Of The Original Sin', so that revellers can comfort themselves by supposing that what has been visited upon poor Merrick is in some way his own fault, or at least it was 'meant to be'.  It is our own moral deformity, not on display as nakedly as this wretch's physical dystrophy, which prompts us to stare and to mock.     The Victorians had a passion for machinery, and the film sustains a brilliant metaphor of human society as being just another apparatus. Fairgrounds are machines of entertainment and profit.  The public is circulated around the stalls and its money extracted.  The grim streets around the London Hospital form an apparatus for housing the workers, hovels laid out in joyless serried ranks, conveniently close to factories and wharves.  Even the hospital is a processing machine, with its regimented lines of beds and its severe architecture.  By moving from fairground to hospital, Merrick has left one industrial monster and been swallowed by another.  Even the public urinal is a comment on the Victorian obsession with 'order', its troughs arranged as regularly as looms in a cotton mill. Because Merrick's poor distorted body offends against these notions of symmetry, he is despised and vilified.     Steam and flame recur as images throughout the film in endless variations.  Steam was the Victorians' power-source, the foundation of their wealth and confidence, quite literally the supplier of their drive.  Here, it represents the dark energy of the human psyche, so admirable when harnessed properly, so destructive when it breaks the bounds of social discipline.  Fire is the enlightening goodness of science, the Promethean beneficence of Treves and his circle, real Victorians who belie the stereotype of pompous and sinister hypocrisy, and who go to enormous pains to nurture and protect a malformed wretch such as Merrick.
    And for all the terrible suffering of Merrick, this is film is a resounding tribute to human kindness.  As viewers, our cynical expectations are continually being defeated.  Treves does not treat Merrick like an anatomical specimen, but warms to the Elephant Man's innate decency.  Carr Gomm does not expel the  hideous creature from the hospital, but shows profound compassion.  Teenage nurses are afraid of Merrick at first, but grow to love him.  We suspect the fashionable actress Mrs. Kendal (played magnificently by Anne Bancroft) of taking a shallow and insincere interest in Merrick, but we are proved wrong yet again.  Treves' wife (a deeply affecting performance by Hannah Gordon) is initially dismayed by Merrick's ugliness, but finds herself weeping helplessly at the tragedy of this sweet man's crushing misfortune.       John Hurt, as Merrick, gives a performance which fills the viewer with awe.  Hardly recognisable as a human being beneath the latex make-up, he blazons Merrick's humanity across the screen.  The gentle wonder with which Merrick beholds the beauty of an ordinary middle-class drawing room is heart-breaking to witness.     Anthony Hopkins and Freddie Jones, as Treves and Bytes respectively, are marvellous.  Treves is tormented by a recurring doubt - is he really no better than Bytes, the deranged mountebank who believes that Merrick belongs to him?  Are the two of them no more than showmen, seeking to exploit Merrick's misfortune?  And flowing from that, are we, the viewers, waiting impatiently to see Merrick's face unveiled, any better than the Victorian gawkers?      The film answers its own question.  Decency is better than cruelty, and Treves is nobler than Bytes.  We all have both Treves and Bytes within us, in varying proportions.  How many of us are capable of Treves' searing self-examination?  Merrick, and this magnificent film about him, touch something deep in our inner selves.",Null,2,2,11 December 1999
There's Something About Mary," 'That Was Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!'
","The Farrelly brothers produced and directed this outstanding comedy film, and are fast assuming cult status as generators of high-quality 'nerd humour' pieces.      Ted is a dorky high school student who falls in love with the beautiful and vivacious Mary, a girl who has recently moved to this Rhode Island neighbourhood.  Ted is smitten by Mary (played with immense charm by Cameron Diaz) simply because she knows his name.  No 'babe' has ever bothered to remember who Ted is until now.  His fumbling ways mark him down as a loser from the outset.  He is completely tongue-tied when asking Berenice to the senior prom, and even worse misfortune befalls him when he attempts to escort Mary.  A catalogue of amusing disasters at Mary's home culminates in a cringe-making accident.  The comic invention of this scene is marvellous. Just watch for the wedding photo on Mary's mantelpiece.    So far, the film has been a traditional American high school comedy, but now the story leaps forward thirteen years.  Mary has qualified in medicine at Princeton and is now in private practice somewhere in Florida.  Ted (Ben Stiller) has not shaken off the aura of a loser, but at least the sad hairstyle has been abandoned.  He is now a regular, likeable guy - and still carrying a torch for Mary.    His friend Dom (Chris Elliott) advises Ted to go after his dream.  He persuades Ted to hire a private investigator in order to trace Mary.  Enter Matt Dillon as the irresistibly cruddy sleazeball private eye, Pat Healey. The film may be moving along nicely at this point, but Dillon provides booster rockets.   The reviving of the dog is a gem of a scene.    It is interesting to see English stand-up comic Lee Evans taking on a dramatic role (Tucker).  Later, when he is Norm the pizza boy, his American accent occasionally slips, but as one would expect of him, he does the comedy mime stuff exceptionally well.    There are some very funny stand-alone set pieces in the film, such as the gay bust and the squad room antics.  Perhaps one shouldn't look too hard for schematic treatments in a light-hearted caper such as 'Mary', but there are some discernible themes in place here.  One recurrent device is dissembling, with the characters constantly surprising the viewer by revealing their 'true' identities, and similarly, much of the plot information on which we rely turns out to be bogus.  It is as if the male characters know that they are unworthy of Mary's love, and have to bolster their prospects by erecting impressive facades.  The only guy who remains true to himself is the one who wins her heart.    Another repeating joke is the geeky music.  A song duo accompanies the action with corny ditties which sound like they have been composed by thirteen-year-olds.  This is much funnier in practice than it sounds in black and white - and it has the added benefit of reinforcing the film's central premise - that Ted is an unlucky dipstick who can never hope for anything good in life.    The switching of the action back and forth between warm Florida and wintry Rhode Island is a useful plot mechanism because it suggests movement in the story, and it points up the contrast between the cold, Maryless north and the bright, hopeful south, where Mary is.    Physical and mental disability do not normally form the subject matter of popular comedy.  The Farrelly brothers and their writers (correctly, in my view) have approached this film from the angle that nothing is taboo, and (if handled well) disability can be funny.  They DO handle it well, and it IS funny.    'Mary' is an appealing, good-natured film which owes much to Cameron Diaz for its charm and lightness of touch.  The cast clearly enjoy working together, and the final credits include an unusual treatment of 'Build Me Up, Buttercup' which encapsulates the sense of exuberant good fun in which this excellent film is steeped.",Null,1,2,10 December 1999
It's a Wonderful Life," 'Sentimental Hogwash!'
","George Bailey is a thoroughly nice guy, the backbone of the small American community into which he was born.  George's story is that of America in the first half of the twentieth century - a happy childhood before the First World War, ambition growing with maturity, then trouble for the family in the wake of the 1929 crash.  George and his family make it through the Depression, and are blessed with success as George's dearly-loved brother Harry wins the Congressional Medal of Honour in World War Two.  From this high point, George's fortunes take a steep nosedive, and the defining crisis of his life is suddenly upon him ...     George's twin ambitions since early childhood have been to explore the world (travel has always fired his imagination) and to 'build things'. Events are constantly cheating him out of his travel plans, and sheer selflessness prevents him from getting an education, his passport out of Bedford Falls and into a career as an architect.  Like his father before him, George is too kindly ever to advance his own personal aims. 
     His adversary and nemesis is Old Man Potter, 'the richest and the meanest man in the county'.  He is as unlike George as a man can be. Immobile and with no curiosity about the world, Potter dominates the small town, and is universally feared and despised.  Without family or home life, Potter has only his money, which he ruthlessly ensures will increase and multiply.  George believes in the community ('we've got to have faith in each other'), whereas Henry F. Potter regards the people as exploitable 'rabble'.  On George's study wall hangs a portrait of Abraham Lincoln. Potter has a bust of Napoleon.     This famous Capra tear-jerker is a masterpiece of emotional manipulation, and incidentally a tremendous piece of cinematic craftsmanship.  The film has two premises, firstly that the fabric of the nation is sound so long as Americans stick to the early settlers' values of communal mutual assistance, and secondly, an enlightened liberal doctrine of the perfectability of mankind.  If ordinary folks are offered chances for betterment, by means of building improved housing and encouraging financial thrift, they will prove themselves to be sober, hardworking citizens, keen to advance the prosperity of their progeny.  George is the liberal hero who embodies these beliefs.  His dream is to raise 'dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw', and when the Martini family takes possession of its property, George is on hand to see Giuseppe realise the American Dream - 'I own my own house!'     The young George knows that he doesn't want to squander his life 'cooped up ... in a shabby little office'.  However, George is the responsible type, and to protect the working people from Potter, and put Harry through college, he assumes the burden of running the family's Building and Loans business.  He grows to realise that his father's legacy is a noble one, the foundation of America's future.     George continues to dream of 'anchor chains, plane motors and train whistles', but the thoughtlessness of others keeps him trapped in Bedford Falls.  Alone outside a house party, he reacts wistfully to the wail of a distant train.  His crisis of conscience when Harry announces the marriage and the new job is a tremendous piece of cinema.  Kind, decent George goes through silent turmoil as it sinks in that his hopes have been dashed again.     If the propositions on which the story rests are simple folksy ones, the story itself is a strong one, told with great zest.  Pacy effervescence keeps the action moving snappily along.  Mary loves George from childhood, as we see in the drugstore sequence.  The prepubescent George shows the traits we come to love in him - industriousness, reliability and social conscience - and he saves Gower the druggist from committing an appalling act of negligence, at great cost to himself.  The tight narrative sweeps us from the kiss to the wedding, and from the honeymoon taxi to the run on the bank.  World war Two, during which 'George fought the battle of Bedford Falls', is an object lesson in concise story-telling.     One of Capra's narrative techniques is to exploit clashes of opposites. We plunge from elation to despair as Harry's triumph gives way to the financial disaster.  Christmas bonhomie is tainted by the chilling presence of the bank examiner.  George's desperate prayer in Martini's bar is accompanied by a jolly Italian ditty.  The 'drowning' drama is followed swiftly by a gentle comedy scene.     The heart of the film is the relationship between George and Mary.  A silent look passes between them at the high school dance, and we know that they have fallen in love.  Their charleston dance (a superbly-choreographed sequence) cements the incipient romance and is followed by a great two-handed scene in which the lovers throw stones at 320 Sycamore, the house which will one day be theirs.  George's later visit to Mary's house once more blends romance and comedy with splendid success.  It is a joy to watch the aching desire of each for the other as they listen to Sam's phone call.     Clarence the wingless angel offers George 'a chance to see what the world would be like without you'.  The nightmare sequence shows Bedford Falls (now known as Pottersville) to be a seedy Gomorrah of jazz bars and strip joints, peopled by a surly, unhappy populace.  George's creed is borne out - 'each man's life touches every other man's life', and he sees that his patient, benign influence has worked its magic.  Bedford Falls is a better place for having known George Bailey.     Watch out for a young Gloria Grahame as Violet, launching a career of playing bad girls.  And is that Donna Reed in Martini's, posing as the bar girl in the peroxide wig?",Null,5,12,11 July 2000
Psycho," 'A Psychiatrist Doesn't Lay The Groundwork ... He Merely Tries To Explain It.'
","A respectable 30-year-old spinster steals $40,000 from her workplace and takes off on a solo car journey to nowhere.  She makes the fateful mistake of staying overnight at the Bates Motel ...     There is a difference between a great film, where the cast and technicians seem inspired and the project is carried along on the energy of its ideas, and a merely good film, in which the cleverness is calculated, and the tricks are consciously inserted.  'Psycho' is merely a good film.     But what cleverness!  The incidental music of Bernard Herrman, Hitchcock's composer of choice, has a discordant, staccato leitmotif in the strings which repeats constantly, building almost hypnotically towards the shrill climax of the shower scene.  Hitchcock deploys a battery of subtle devices to keep the viewer feeling vaguely uneasy.  Sexual frankness was a shocking thing in a mainstream movie in 1960, and the opening scene (showing Marion's 'extended lunch hour' with Sam) is so sexually honest that it cannot have failed to disturb contemporary cinema audiences.  Faces are lit from below or the side, creating an inchoate sense of foreboding.  Owls and ravens, traditional omens of evil, preside silently over Norman's parlour. The windshield wiper which fails to clear the rain is a symbol of Marion's guilty conscience.     The film's abiding mood is one of creepy uneasiness, and this is reinforced at every turn by Hitchcock's system of visual imagery.  There is, of course, the Old Dark House, but far less obvious techniques are also at work.  As Arbogast mounts the stairs, the camera retreats disconcertingly before him.  The tines of the rakes in Sam's store are raised like bony, clutching fingers behind Lila's head.  Marion's unblinking eyeball is compositionally echoed by the circular plughole, the water draining out as her life force ebbs away.     In the long dialogue scene between Norman and Marion ('We all go a little mad sometimes'), the rhythm of the cutting is exquisite.  Sometimes we see the speaker, sometimes the listener, as the rapidity of the cuts forms a counterpoint to the text, and emphasises the discomfort of the characters (Marion wary but self-possessed, Norman outwardly affable but painfully shy).     The cinematic axiom, 'Show it, don't tell it', is beautifully illustrated in the scene in Marion's bedroom.  The camera closes in on the bundles of banknotes lying on the bed, then pans to the packed suitcase, telling us without the need for words that she has decided to take the money and run.     Then something puzzling happens.  The film seems to lose all belief in its own precepts, and the rich visual symbolism is abruptly abandoned.  Lila opines, 'I'll feel better when all this is explained,' but she is wrong. The explanation is a huge let-down.  We get Dr. Simon, a psychiatrist, lecturing us at tedious length about Norman's condition.  'Show it, don't tell it' flies out of the window.  Maybe Stefano, the scriptwriter, realised that the running time was already over two hours and the thing needed its loose ends tied up rapidly.  Perhaps the flat, prosaic ending is the price Hitch has to pay for the slow painstaking build-up in the early reels (it is almost half an hour before Norman makes it onto the screen).  Whatever the reason, I for one found the closing section very disappointing.",Null,14,26,30 December 2000
To Kill a Mockingbird," 'Stand up. Your Father's Passin'.'
","In a rural county somewhere in the Deep South, some time between the Depression and Pearl Harbor, a black field worker is accused of raping a white woman.  Atticus Finch is the country attorney who takes on the defence of Tom Robinson.  Atticus is a well-respected man, but 'lawin' fer niggers' is not going to make life in Maycomb County easy for him or his family. 
    'To Kill A Mockingbird' is one of the best, and best-selling, American novels of the twentieth century, and hardly needs any introduction here. The story is recounted by Scout, Atticus' tomboy daughter, who is six years old at the time of the events which she describes.  Her adored older brother Jem is her constant companion, and the narrative evokes (in both book and film) the distinctive world of childhood.    When I first saw the film, the novel was already a much-loved part of my mental furniture.  I felt that Gregory Peck's Atticus was right from a cinematic perspective, but wrong in terms of fidelity to the novel.  To me, Atticus was older and more frail, and yet somehow less grave.  On a second viewing, however, I have revised my opinion.  Peck is an outstanding Atticus, and this is borne out by the IMDb trivia section, which usefully explains that Harper Lee was so pleased with the way Peck captured her father's essence that she made a gift to him of Atticus' watch.    It is not putting it too strongly to describe 'Mockingbird' as the first film of the American nouvelle vague.  With their clean, unpretentious images, the opening credits could have been filmed by Truffaut.  This is a style which suffuses the whole film.  Everything is shot with an unfussy clarity and a complete absence of fancy tricks and fancy lenses.  Russell Harlan deserves credit for his intelligent cinematography.    All the novel's major incidents are here.  Scout rides the tyre onto the Radley porch, Jem loses his pants on the fence, Walter souses his vegetables in syrup and the lynch mob is disarmed by Scout's innocent but apposite remarks.  If the Tom Robinson saga seems hurried into the film, as compared with the book, this is entirely understandable - a movie has ninety minutes in which to do the work of three hundred pages.    As Scout the narrator introduces herself, Scout the protagonist swings into camera shot.  This elegant efficiency is characteristic of the whole film.  The energy of the children, and their excitement and confusion on Scout's first day at school, are beautifully in the breakfast scene, with the staccato banging of the screen door.  The Walter Cunningham lunch is terrific, with Peck admirably putting across the deadpan wisdom of Atticus. Mayella's mendacity, and the wretchedness of her position, are exposed by the very simple but very effective zoom-in during her cross-examination.  As the good ol' boy prosecutor questions Tom, the US flag stands between them, symbolising both the gulf which separates the two cultures and the enlightened work of bridging the chasm being undertaken by the federal government.  This was the era of civil rights agitation, and of the progressive outlook of the Kennedy administration.  It is shocking to the people in the courtroom that Tom should pity Mayella, but for us it confirms his integrity as a man.    Elmer Bernstein's music is, as always, classy, subtle and designed to enhance the meaning of the film.  The opening credits are accompanied by the lone voice of a child, humming.  This was revolutionary for the time, but perfectly-judged, being in keeping with the film's nouvelle vague style, and highly evocative of the child's-eye-view.  The 'creepy' theme for the night raid on the Radley house is brilliant, the piano and clarinet combination producing a memorably haunting effect.    Dill, the little boy whose return signals the advent of lazy summer days as surely as the flowering of the cotton, is an interesting character in his own right.  In real life this youngster was Truman Capote, Harper Lee's childhood friend.  Here he is played by the excellent John Megna.  All three child actors (Mary Badham as Scout and Phillip Alford as Jem) are simply marvellous.  Scout's mixture of self-assurance and childish vulnerability, and Jem's leadership qualities, are captured perfectly.    I accept that I may be wrong in this, but it seems to me that the film hints at a sexual relationship between Atticus and Cal (Estelle Evans), the black woman who runs the Finch menage.  After all, it would make thematic sense.  For all practical purposes Cal is a mother to the children and a wife to Atticus.  Man and woman share a bond of mutual respect which is never voiced because it does not need to be.  At one point, something crops up and Atticus asks Cal to stay the night.  She agrees without hesitation. Symbolically, this union (enlightened white with decent black) will bear fruit in a future America.  Peck seems to go for a 'Clark Kent' look for Atticus, and my guess is, it's deliberate.  Atticus is Superman, the totally benign, totally capable American hero.  That he can couple with the flower of black womanhood is implicit in, and important to, the film's meaning.    The cramped little 'Huck Finn' courthouse with its imposing facade is wonderful, as is Scout's familiar neighbourhood, with its mature trees and creaking verandahs, flawlessly evoking the Maycomb of the book.    'Boo' Radley is played by the always-admirable Robert Duvall, here making his first feature appearance.  Onscreen for a matter of seconds, with no dialogue, he sears onto the viewer's memory the definitive image of Boo, 'the unlikeliest of guardian angels'.",Null,1,2,1 January 2000
The Silence of the Lambs," 'You Don't Want Hannibal Lecter Inside Your Head'
","Demme and his long-time collaborator, Tak Fujimoto, have a crack at turning a weird novel into a movie.  I'm afraid to say that it doesn't work.    There are moments when the film seems about to go somewhere interesting, but each time the idea fizzles out.  Clarice's flashback memories are evoked by Lecter's nasty mindgames, but in the end her feelings for her lost father are opened up too pedantically and the chance to do something truly disturbing is lost.  An exquisite dilemma is set up - should Agent Starling flout her orders and training, and subject herself to appalling risks, in order to save the endangered Catherine?  But Lecter decides to pursue other objectives, and the potential is squandered.    Intelligence is a fine thing in a film, and it is very satisfying for the viewer to see the clues unravelled in a thriller.  However, cleverness for its own sake, unanchored in the bedrock of character, is a pernicious thing.  Lecter's anagrams ('Hester Mofet') don't come off, partly because they are too remote from the chase itself, and partly because they have to be explained to the audience.  'We covet what we see every day ...' - this is hopelessly poor as a clue, and when the agents solve it, I for one am reminded of the TV 'Batman' episode when the Penguin commits robberies all over Gotham which, when marked on the map, sketch out the shape of his distinctive hat.  It's as far-fetched as that.    Doctor Chilton is awful.  He is a cartoon character, outlandishly pompous and unsympathetic.  The prisoner's escape ploy makes me cringe, it is so preposterous - wouldn't the paramedics actually try to examine the supposed facial wounds?  And why are they pumping him full of Ringer's solution without ascertaining that he's losing haemostatic pressure?    Admittedly, Clarice's time in Bill's house is psychologically gripping, but this has nothing to do with the film's alleged cleverness.  It is the oldest device of all, to get us to 'know' the girl, so that we make some emotional investment in her, then stick her in an old dark house with the creepy bad guy.  Nothing about that final sequence stands up to even the lightest analysis.  Why doesn't the FBI agent simply call for back-up, and stay put?  Once she locates the victim, isn't her duty to stay with her to protect her?  Once Bill eludes the agent, why doesn't he just escape?  He can't want to kill the agent as part of his compulsion.  She doesn't come close to fitting the victim profile that the film has so laboriously developed for us.  He must know that if he remains at the scene, other agents will arrive soon.    Lecter is interesting enough initially, but one has to question the way the film makes a hero of him.  Are psychotic killers imprisoned in cages in large rooms like this?  Are they handcuffed to the bars at mealtime?  And supervised by a team of two no-brainers?  Can they dupe SWAT teams and medical staff with ease, and escape, blood-soaked, from busy cities?  Do we really prefer Lecter to Chilton?  And if we do, should we?  I don't want Hannibal inside my head, not because he is terrifying (which he isn't), but because he is a waste of my time.",Null,2,3,5 February 2000
Blade Runner," 'It's Artificial? Of Course It Is!'
","In the year 2019, Los Angeles is threatened by a gang of renegade replicants.  A replicant is a robot which so closely approximates humanity that it is almost impossible to distinguish it from the real thing.  Even the replicant itself may fail to realise that it is merely a machine.  The robots are programmed with a maximum lifespan of four years, a safety device intended to prevent them becoming too knowledgeable, and therefore a threat to human beings.  Furthermore, each replicant is provided with software which contains a fictitious but credible personal history, so it 'remembers' its own childhood.     The breakaway band of replicants poses a threat to Los Angeles. Usually, combat androids such as these spend their working lives in space, stuck on labour colonies orbiting the earth.  Mutinies are usually contained locally but this gang has made its way back to earth because its leader, Roy Batty, wants to force the humans to extend his lifespan.  Blade runners are essentially police officers who specialise in 'retiring' (that is, destroying) apostate robots.  Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a blade runner and he is given the task of hunting down the four surviving members of the replicant band.  What follows is a rather mundane cops-and-bad-guys movie in a quirkily futuristic setting.     And what of this future world?  Cops patrol the city in black-and-white squad cars, just like in 1982, but now the cars can hover in the air.  The depiction of downtown architecture is visually impressive, but unfortunately it is patent nonsense.  Urban traffic and the science of robotics will not be like this in 2019.  This science fiction is so much science baloney.     'Watch out for water,' says J.F. Sebastian as he shows Priss to his apartment, and it is a warning that should be standard in every Ridley Scott film.  Why does Ridley always conceive of the future in terms of steam gouts, dripping ceilings and restless searchlights?  And why, for that matter, must a man in a fez always be devious and cowardly?     Rutger Hauer makes a terrific villain, mixing suavete with chilling ruthlessness.  Daryl Hannah and Brion James are interesting casting choices as the replicants Priss and Leon, and Harrison Ford is Harrison Ford.  The character of Rachel (played by Sean Young) adds intellectual depth to an otherwise pedestrian shoot-'em-up.  Her moment of tragic self-comprehension is the best thing in the film.     I for one fail to see why this film is slavered over and hailed a cult masterpiece.  The storyline is dull and no character, with the possible exception of Rachel, has any internal life.  The final symbol of mortality is attractive enough, but why was Batty holding a dove in the first place?",Null,0,0,20 December 2000
Casino," Goodfellas revisited ...
","Anyone seen Goodfellas? You know ... gangsters, violence, long story, Joe Pesci being a complete and utter maniac? Well, save your bucks. In a nutshell, CASINO is a total replica of a very good film. I'm not saying it's not good. It's just a replica.Sam Rothstein (De Niro) is the man; a gambling genius who (his Jewishness holding him back) becomes THE man in Las Vegas. The problem is that he isn't a made guy cosa-nostra-wise. Doh!! If only he had an Italian background, so many lives could have been spared. As it happens, the Vegas mob bosses insist on Mr. Pesci being there to 'take care' of business. In other words, sadistically maim any idiot who messes with our Sam's good business. Watch out particularly for the 'hammer from nowhere' and Joe's novel use of a Black and Decker workmate which will, guaranteed, bring water to the eyes.Much is made of Sharon Stone's tour de force in this movie as Ginger, Sam's moll. It's definitely a cut above her previous acting credits (who remembers Sliver? answers on a postcard) but at the end of the day, it comes down to her being given a decent script for once, and the chance to ham it up for all she's worth. If screaming and ranting on coke guarantees you plaudits, fair play. Worth a nomination? OK. The Oscar itself? Please.Scorsese is the best director around for this kind of film. You will come out of the cinema saying 'Wow', 'Yipes', 'Cool' etc. Even after a good three hours. No arguments - it is hard hitting and scary. BUT Martin - it's been done before. By you. And with Goodfellas, it was so much more original and, basically, better. De Niro, Pesci and Liotta were seminal. Replace Liotta with Stone, and it's only semi-seminal.Casino will appeal to those who love a good shoot-up, blood and guts and plenty of actors yelling at each other. You will get value for your video rental, if that's what you're after.Let's face it - three hours! But if you want better value, hire out Goodfellas again.",Null,6,9,24 December 1998
