Iron Man 3," Entertaining and fun
","Lots of explosions as always but funny moments, sweet moments, action moments, doesn't take itself too seriously, fun and engaging and entertaining action flick. How does one write 10 lines of text without giving away the movie. Suffice it to say it is worth seeing at the movies and paying for it. So many movies are lackluster and not worth the price of a ticket - like the Avenger movies which were not as fun and easily forgettable. Iron 3 wrapped up the story line very nicely, although who's to say there won't be more - but it works as it is and was better than Iron 2. Here is one more line. Come on now don't be like that. I think this is enough. And I love RDJ, yum.",8,1,6,3 May 2013
