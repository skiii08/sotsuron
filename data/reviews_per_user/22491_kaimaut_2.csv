It," IT- a good horror film or... bad?
","IT was a good movie. I really liked the start but in the end, it got a bit down. There was the part where George was without a hand in the sewers. Did not you show him too many times? There was also the passage that a pennywise died and was a jump scare. Why do you need another one? And the end was too good for a horror film! kiss? In the order of the oath of blood that if it comes back then they will come to fight it but ... you understand me.
