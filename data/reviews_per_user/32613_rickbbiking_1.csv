Blade Runner 2049," Absolutely loved it!
","Mere words cannot describe the intensity of 'Blade Runner 2049.' This film grips the viewer from the outset and never lets go. The special effects are simply amazing, but it is the story line that captures the imagination. I have always enjoyed dystopian stories and science fiction. Well, 'Blade Runner 2049' contains the best of both of these genre, along with romance, drama, love, and a whole lot of heart. For a film about human replicants, that's pretty damn good!",10,6,17,8 October 2017
