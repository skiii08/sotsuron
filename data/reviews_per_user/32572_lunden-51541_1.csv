The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Informative and thrilling
","The return of Katiness and all of her glory, with the support of those around her and the other districts and their people. She continues to try to decide whether to follow her heart or her mind. This movie is filled with highs and low, some of which are expected and others shocking in themselves. I truthfully enjoyed Mockingjay Part 1, but though as though they should have ended in a more suspenseful way instead of giving the audience more. It was full of information that is needed to move the story along and to prepare the audience for what is to come. I would give this one a thumbs up, and if you are a hunger games lover you wont be disappointed!",8,1,8,26 February 2015
