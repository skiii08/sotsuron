The Ring," When Scary Mixes with Suspense and Intrigue you get...
","The Ring,Like many here I've seen the Japanese version and that's pretty damn good. When I heard of this remake I groaned to myself - You know that sinking feeling when Hollywood remake anything. Fresh from watching my most recent Horror film 'Ghost Ship' - remove Horror from that description and replace with 'Pants'So I don't want to describe much of the storyline - only to say that it's about people watching a video and after seeing that video you only have 7 days to live - why? You watch it and find out!Acting is credible and everyone seems to give good performances. Also it's true to the original in that when the scares happen you get that 'skin crawling' kind of fear. It's not openly scary with over the top visual effects like so many other so called Horror films, it's that psychological scary type. (My fave.) Although I will admit to looking away when I saw the face of the first dead girl - frightened the willies out of me.So my advice is watch this and the Japanese one - both are worth seeing. Well done to the makers of this film - first scary film in a while. 7.5/10Is that my phone ringing???????????EnjoyRuss",Null,0,0,16 February 2003
