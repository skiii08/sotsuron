Requiem for a Dream," The most provocative and disturbing movie I have ever seen.
","This movie was the most intense piece of art I believe I have ever seen.  Your eyes become pealed to the screen as image after image of drug induced reality is flashed before you.  This is not for the faint at heart: a 22 year old guy I was with walked out.  It is actually a testament of the director's talent that the audience is drawn into the tortured lives of these characters.  I would recommend this film due to its mastery, however proceed with some caution, for it deeply disturbs your mind.",10,0,0,27 January 2001
