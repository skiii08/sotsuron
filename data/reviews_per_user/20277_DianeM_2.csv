The Blair Witch Project," Disappointing; made me physically sick
","No, I did not vomit from terror, but rather from the motion sickness I suffered after seeing this film. I was SO disappointed; it certainly was not the scariest film I have ever seen. Yes, it was eerie, and perhaps the nausea was part of the experience, but it does not live up to the hype. The idea was original, though, and as someone who appreciates quality film, I have to say that it scores them points with me, but it's not a great film. The ending was, however, excellent in its presentation & the questions it leaves you with.",5,0,1,14 September 1999
The Mummy," Not profound, but fun
","The Mummy was surprisingly entertaining. It was pretty funny, and full of action and special effects.  It was not a particularly stimulating film intellectually, but it was great for a Sunday afternoon fun-fest.  I recommend it.",7,0,0,10 May 1999
