The Hangover," The Hangover - Funniest Film EVER
","Saw this film last night and without a doubt, this is the funniest film i have ever seen. It by far exceeded my expectations as thought it was going to be a typical 'bloke' film but from start to finish, I was roaring up.There are many moments that are quite wrong and you feel slightly concerned that you are laughing so hard....baby at the table immediately springs to mind.....but this is a very clever comedy. No detail is spared and every cast member has been cast perfectly.I can't begin to recommend this film highly enough.GO SEE!!!",10,12,22,3 June 2009
