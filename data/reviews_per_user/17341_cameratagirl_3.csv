It," Terrifying and Hilarious
","I'm a little bit of a chicken when it comes to scary movies but I really wanted to see this one. So I took the plunge, and I'm so glad I did.Super creepy but not in a cheap, startling type of way. It was more of a sick, twisted anticipation of what was coming next.The humor was incredible and so well intermingled with the drama, suspense and horror. There were definitely some laugh-out-loud funny moments that give you a chance to recover from your last creepy interaction with Pennywise. I always love a little humor, no matter the genre.You won't be wasting your time if you see this movie.",10,0,1,31 May 2019
Just Go with It," Common story line, revamped and very well done!
","This movie was hilarious. Lots of laugh out loud moments. Don't misunderstand and think it's a typical Adam Sandler extreme. It isn't. He's a much more subtle but very entertaining character. But the shining star really is Jennifer Aniston, pretending to be someone else, plus her weird side kick, 'Dolf'. The kids are fabulous also.It's basically 'the tin man has a heart' after all plus a hilarious ride to discover his true feelings.Watch this. If you enjoy a simple romcom on a night when your brain is fried and you need to laugh, this is the flick for you.",9,0,0,7 June 2020
Love Actually," I don't get it...
","Honestly, I don't understand the applause on this movie. It was fine. Maybe I was disappointed because of its amazing critic and user reviews. I expected to be blown away but it was a basic rom-com, only there were 4 or 5 stories going on at once that ended up loosely intertwined and it was over 3 dang hours long. It was actually quite unfortunate because there were only two of the several stories that I was actually interested in. It felt like quite a mess, actually.It wasn't awful. I suppose, if you have time on your hands, it's worth taking a look to make your own decision. But I don't understand the hype at all. It was a solid hour and a half too long and had waaaaay too much going on.",3,2,3,4 February 2020
