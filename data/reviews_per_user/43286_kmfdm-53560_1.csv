Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Meh
","To be honest I fell asleep when I was in the theater seeing this the first time. When I watched it at home and really paid it the attention I thought it deserved I noticed two things. The CGI is TERRIBLE. Flat, fake...it looks like a bad video game. And then I backed it up (keep in mind, I was watching it on DVD, so it's easy to do that) and I noticed that the CGI aliens mouths didn't at all match the voices. They are aliens - why do they speak what looks like dubbed English? I would have rather hear 'blah blah yadda doo blee be' with subtitles than see badly done CGI characters speaking English with their mouths obviously not matching the words. Other than that, the back story was ok but it's visually an incredibly dated 1990's movie.",5,0,0,11 January 2020
