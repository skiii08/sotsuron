The Sound of Music," The best movie!!!!!!!!!!!
","This is my absolute favourite movie, because it makes you happy when you're sad or is just plain good anytime. The characters are interesting, the songs are soooooo catchy and it's one of those movies that you can watch over and over and over and over and over and over again.",10,1,7,17 October 1998
