The Blair Witch Project," A bit of understanding required!
","I saw this movie for the first time at home alone and at night. I've never been scared by a movie before in my life, but Blair Witch was the closest I have ever come! I also must add that I live 20 miles from the nearest town, within a sizeable area of bush.I think that people who have never spent a night outdoors in the wilderness or explored an abandoned house will never truly appreciate this movie. For those who have, you can see how the suspense is very real, although the story is not. I can say I have done both, and for those who say that this movie is lame or horribly made, I have just one thing to say. If your ever outside at night in the middle of nowhere, you'll be able to see just how expertly the filmmakers have played on our fears.",Null,0,1,30 March 2003
