Requiem for a Dream," A moving example of man's drive for happiness.
","The first time I saw this movie was in shock. I was so moved by Jared Leto's performance and Ellen Burstyn's. They choose the right people for the movie. The last fifteen minutes are painful to watch, NOT because it's bad acting or boring but because it's so real and gritty that I feel sick when I see Jennifer Connelly on the table 'dancing', Jared Leto in the hospital, Ellen Burstyn in the ward and Malon Wayans in prison.The movie made me realize how far people are willing to go just to be happy. I always knew I would do whatever it takes, legally, to become what I want but to see on the verge of life and death running toward what they believe to make them happy so sick you can really see how far people are willing to go.I think everyone should see this movie AT LEAST once in their life. When I bought I took it over to my friends house and we watched it in his living room with is 12 year old sister and I told her 'watch this. just don't leave until the end, and you'll feel something inside.' She watched and felt different, even if it was just about never injecting drugs at least she would take something away. I think she realized how power human's will is when it comes to happiness.",10,3,6,6 August 2006
Ratatouille," 2nd Best Pixar movie of all time!
","I saw this movie with some reservations, I was like 'its a kids movie. I'm 19 yrs old'. But you know what, I was sorely mistaken. It's not just a kids movie.Pixar does an amazing job with this movie, it's up with the original Toy Story. The character are entertaining and easy to relate to. Everyone can relate to wanting to do something and having someone tell you that you can't do it; everyone can relate to just wanting that one shot. Ultimately that is all Remy and Linguini want. The characters are also well flawed, Remy's desire to be a great chef almost gets in the way of his family and friends. Linguini has to lie to protect Remy.This movie was more than I was expecting. A good story, well crafted characters, and comedy around every corner.",9,4,6,24 July 2007
Transformers," Best action movie of the year
","This is by far the best action movie of the year. Compare it to Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, this movie is so much better. Action movies stereotypically have simple plots, and Transformers is no different. The story is simple, keep the Decepticons from getting the All Spark. Definitely not hard to follow.I think Shia LaBeouf did a good job as Sam. He kept things light when there wasn't much action going on and he showed urgency when he had to. I have to give him props for making out with Megan Fox (Mikelea). She is smokin'.The effects in the movie are top notch. OK, so CGI will always looks a little cartoonish no matter how detailed it is. It will never have 100% correct lighting. It is pretty damn close, but nothing will ever beat models.You could go see the 4th Die Hard movie, or the 3rd Pirates movie, but in the end only one movie has the killer action.

Pulp Fiction," A movie jumbled in order but in perfect sequence
","Tarantino is the best. No one can touch his style of mixing the story line up. This is my all time favorite movie. I once heard someone say there was so much violence in the movie and so many deaths. I countered and said 'There's less than ten deaths.' You only see about seven people die and it's not gun to the head, it's like when Bruce Willis cuts the guy with the sword it's with the other's guys back to us so we don't see a whole lot, just a red line across his stomach after wards.I like what Samuel L. said about the movie. 'It's not about death, but rather redemption.' I personally think this movie is semi-religious. Well it has a lot of religious symbolism, even though there is no allegory like John Travolta, for example, is God. It's not like that. There are three main stories, seven deaths, and everyone is given a second chance to change their life.",10,1,2,6 August 2006
Sin City," Bad people doing good things.
","Sin City, great movie. This is one of the few movies I feel deserves a 10.Frank Miller created these amazingly flawed characters. Marv, a violent alcoholic who is obsessed with finding the murderer of his mistress. Dwight, a criminal on the run who wants to protect the women he loves. And Hartigan, the one good cop among many corrupt ones. The characters are ones people can relate to.There are three separate but intertwined stories. Starts off with Hartigan 8 years before. Hartigan just wants to stop a serial rapist. Next is the story of Marv. A semi-crazy man trying to avenge the unjust death of his mistress. After that is the story of Dwight. Dwight basically just wants to protect the women he loves. First the bar maid, then Gail. The movie ends with Hartigan getting out of jail to save Nancy.I remember when I first said 'I want to see that movie', a couple of people looked at me and asked why. They couldn't understand that the movie was not so much about corruption, sex, money, fame, whatever as it is about doing the right thing.",10,0,2,19 October 2006
V for Vendetta," Remember V
","This is the best movie of the year. It's great. I really like how this is so straight forward, no subtext or subplots. I also really like how it's not a movie with political overtones, but a political movie. Some people may take Supreme Chancelor Adam Suttler as President George W. but I don't really think it's him. Suttler has an agenda, and that is to be all powerful and control everyone and everything. Bush, as much as I like him, doesn't have the intelligence to manipulate people like Suttler does. I think it's just a movie showing an extreme and how if people want change they have to fight for it.I really like Natalie Portman's performance in this movie. Her accent fades in a couple of places but that's forgivable. I think the part that sold me on her as that role was when she was in the cell. The emotion she shows, and then the lack of emotion she shows at the end of that. She was just like 'shoot me, I don't fear you any more.' I also liked Hugo Weaving's performance. Even though you never see his face, it's almost as though you can see his face. He just puts so much emotion into his performance. I also like the guy they choose for Suttler. He played it very well being the villain and being so callous.I think we all need to be like V a little bit. We all need to fight for what is right.",9,2,4,6 August 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," From now on you're Magic Man, and I'm El Diablo... I think it means chicken or something in Spanish
","I really liked the movie. I thought that it was really funny. Will Ferrell is a comic genius. He may not have jokes but he's just a goofy guy who can make people laugh even when someone is getting stabbed. The movie doesn't really have any subtext or real meaning behind it; it's just a good loose yourself-while-laughing movie. It's a movie with no intent other than to make people laugh, and the movie succeeds in doing so.For those who want to see a movie that is funny and has a deeper meaning, don't see this. This has nothing to offer other than people doing stupid things and making other laugh. That is the beauty of Will Ferrell's movies. You can go into one sad, depressed, whatever and come out laughing and feeling better. Because you go in with no intent of learning anything but just forgetting about everything else at that moment and laughing.",9,0,3,6 August 2006
