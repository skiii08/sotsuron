Mission: Impossible III," Boring!!!!
","This is the first movie that I slept nearly all the way through. I swear its true. I had to watch the movie on the small screen again to see what I missed and I skipped through that as well. Okay Mission impossible 1 was mind blowing. It had an amazing story and the action was just as good. Mission Impossible 2 had even better , though even more unrealistic , action but not that great a story. Still it was worth watching. And now we have Mission Impossible 3 which I guess is supposed to show the more human side of Agent Hunt. Though the inital action was great, I started dozing off from the point where his girl friend gets kidnapped. To be frank I wasn't that keen on watching the movie when I saw the trailer which was lacklustre at best and not what I was expecting from a Mission Impossible. Yet I was willing to give the movie a shot and I was disappointed. There can be a hundred reasons why people could give me why the movie was great but the bottom line is that I didn't like it.",4,1,3,27 July 2006
