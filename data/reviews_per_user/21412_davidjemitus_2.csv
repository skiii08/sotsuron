Skyfall," Too many plot holes
","This review is for people who have seen the film – not those deciding whether to go or not. OK, so my favourite recent Bond movie is Casino Royale - lots of action, great girls, gripping storyline and great performances. Skyfall takes Bond in a new direction and we should go with that. But it didn't work. Bond is made into a hopeless, weak shadow of his former self!As a redemption movie maybe it could have worked, but Bond is all about style, taking on the bad guys, success against the odds and above all lots of action, girls, gadgets and fun. Skyfall does have some good action scenes – but that's all there is to commend it. I don't mind plot holes where the film is enjoyable enough to get over them, but this film left a nasty taste in the mouth. For example : 1. The bad guy goes to enormous effort to crash a tube train underground. WHY? The train is clearly empty (tube trains are never empty). A train full of injured people would slow down pursuers but an empty train – pointless. It's in the film just to appear in the trailer. 2. Q connects the bad guys computer onto the MI6 network. No IT worker in their right mind would connect a suspicious computer onto any network. Q is supposed to be the smartest person around –instead, he's mister thicko. 3. The bad guy escapes and Bond is in poor shape but he's the only person who chases after the bad guy. Why? What happened to everyone else who works for MI6? 4. Bond wants to protect M and catch the bad guys – so he takes her to a wilderness and has just a handgun for protection against a small army led by a genius. Bond's not just a has been – he's taken leave of his brains and so did the scriptwriter. I hope the next Bond film is a lot better and returns to the classy, dangerous spy thriller adventure we all expect.",7,1,4,24 January 2013
Logan," A promising idea but a dark unpleasant film is the result
","Logan is an older man and Professor 'wheels' is almost senile.
Hhmm. X-Man films are meant to light and very bright and full of action and surprise.This is dark and nasty.
The fight scenes are excellent. Hugh Jackman puts in a huge performance and Patrick Stewart helps where his character can.Showing a young child committing such violence is a bad idea.Overall the film is lacking the life affirming choices of X-Men and is just dark and unpleasant and I was glad when it ended.",4,1,8,15 February 2020
