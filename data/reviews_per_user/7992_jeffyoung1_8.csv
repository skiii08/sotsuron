Blade Runner 2049," Curious observations of Blade Runner 2049 you'll find interesting
","Spoilers due to references and descriptions of scenes in the movie.Let me get this out of the way first. 1) Watch BLADE RUNNER (1982) first, if you haven't, before watching BLADE RUNNER 2049. You'll understand it better and enjoy it more.2) Out of the traditional Hollywood four stars rating system, I'll award 3 stars out of 4, which means, GOOD, so yes, you will like this movie, especially if you've already seen the first BLADE RUNNER (1982). I could be tempted to give 3.5 stars but am not certain so at least I am comfortable with a solid 3 out of 4 stars.BACKGROUND: Los Angeles County in 2049 has changed little since 2019, only to get worse. LA still looks like the gloomy, rainy British Isles. In fact all of southern California looks like it. Even San Diego city and county no longer exist except to be massive garbage dumps. The multicultural, multi-ethnic, and multi-language universe of Los Angeles is highly emphasized and there are no scenes of first generation Asian immigrants overrunning metropolitan Los Angeles on foot and on bicycles as was seen in 2019. Everyone seems to be multi-lingual or bilingual with English as the first language. People can speak a foreign language or the highly developed street slang while switching to normal English spoken with no dialect or inflection. Los Angeles looks to be a crummy place to live but people still want to live there and it may look like population has in fact increased. Mass commercialization through high graphics technology is all around. The skyscraper illuminated video adverts from 2019 are still around but in 2049 have been supplemented with holographic advertisements all over the place and on the streets, with holographic scantily clad women suddenly appearing next to pedestrians and shoppers like hi-tech, colorful ghosts selling something or themselves. FDA standards of advertising seem to have been abolished decades ago. Much of the hi-tech skyscraper adverts and the holograms show female nudity and apparently everyone is okay with it including parents. In fact 2049 Los Angeles is a feminist' nightmare. While women can still reach career positions as demonstrated by the female police lieutenant, but the female body has become extremely sexualized for commercial and pleasure purposes and is displayed in your face with innumerable, brightly lit video and holographic ads around the city. More, it's because prostitution has been legal in Los Angeles (California) for decades from 2019. Los Angeles is a run-down Sodom in the high-tech 21st century still awaiting its final judgment.If you've seen the 1982 BLADE RUNNER you'll know what I mean. Replicants are bio-engineered humans, long the stuff of long past science fiction movies. So in essence they're people, just stronger, faster, more agile, and of at least, above average intelligence. You start to realize that the latest generation of human replicants has achieved what mad scientists, insane dictators, and eugenicists have long sought...an improved human being. Yet the biases from the real humans remain from 2019. Replicants are still called, skinjobs. If the replicants took over the world, the world would still be populated by humans, just stronger and smarter ones.If you're a science fiction fan like me, you can't help notice parallels in BLADE RUNNER 2049 from past science fiction movies, whether that is coincidental or by purpose which would make some of BLADE RUNNER 2049 derivative. a. I see the parallel from Star Trek's, 'Khan', where 20th century earth science eugenically created stronger and more intelligent humans that became dictators and brought about world war three. b. I see the parallel in urban Los Angeles to the brightly lit, commercialized and highly sexualized city shown in, 'Artificial Intelligence. c. I see the parallel in the personalities of the replicants to the bio-genetically in-vitro altered humans in, 'Gattaca'. The Blade Runner world of replicants have the same mental and emotional stability that results in a flat personality that makes them speak and converse like Mr. Spock. d. The special effects did a miraculous job in replicating (no pun intended) Rachel from the 1982 Blade Runner. I can only assume that CGI was used. Similar effects were used to recreate the youthful-looking 1984 terminator played by Arnold Schwarzenegger for the 2014 Terminator. I think I noticed this 2049 Rachel replicant having a somewhat wider face than the 1982 movie's Rachel, played by actress Sean Young. Still, it was excellent. I don't hold any of this against the movie.My final judgment. Go watch the movie but only if you have already seen the 1982 BLADE RUNNER. If not, go find the DVD or live-stream the movie on the Internet and watch it. Then go see BLADE RUNNER 2049. You won't be disappointed. The two hours plus went by fast. There's really no slow point in the movie to get up and use the restroom. You'll miss something but have someone next to you tell you what you missed.",8,2,11,6 October 2017
Wind River," Shoutout to Elizabeth Olsen
","This movie, WIND RIVER, is definitely worth watching. The cast is excellent and one of the main actors, Game and Fishing official Cory Lambert played by actor Jeremy Renner is superb.
But my hat goes off to Elizabeth Olsen as FBI agent, Jane Banner.
One of the reasons I held off on watching Wind River was my original concern that Elizabeth Olsen was going to be unrealistically portrayed as some kind of FBI superheroine agent who kicks 6-feet tall bad guys around. First, I was wrong thinking Olsen is 5'3'. I was surprised to learn that she's actually 5'6' although in the movie she did look very short to me. I really loved Olsen's FBI Jane Banner because she WASN'T a phony superheroine with super strength and martial arts master skills and a crack shot. Her FBI character was completely believable and likeable. I'll tell you why.
1) FBI agent Jane Banner is a desk-bound, FBI agent based out of Las Vegas. Banner is well-trained, professional, but young and inexperienced.
2) Jane Banner is obviously no Wonder Woman and she clearly understands her own limitations and lack of field experience. Yet she doesn't make excuses and puts in the required time and effort and we see that she does her best given the mere perfunctory response the FBI lends to a ho-hum homicide on a little-known Indian Reservation out in the boondocks vastness of Wyoming.
3) Jane Banner is a likeable person. She has no overt personality flaws and no ego hang-ups. She is polite, courteous, and tactful and doesn't bulldoze her way onto the reservation murder investigation. Yet she skillfully deploys her federal (FBI) authority to defuse a dangerous confrontation between the oil rig security guards and the local sheriffs.
4) Jane's FBI training shows when she immediately realizes the danger of a suspicious, drugged-up Indian suspect starting to reach inside his own clothing which is justified when the tweaker pulls out a spray canister of pepper spray.
5) Jane's youthful inexperience shows when she knocks on the front door of the murder victim's boyfriend's quarters. At the time they suspected the boyfriend as the murderer and didn't know the boyfriend was also a murder victim himself. But not knowing that, Jane should have kept to the side of the door when knocking on it. The real killer shot Jane through the door. Luckily Jane, following her FBI training, did not neglect to wear her bulletproof vest.
6) Jane Banner does not turn out to be a superheroine and she doesn't save the day but she gets her licks in and helps bring down a few of the bad guys. It's Cory (Renner) who is the main hero who saves the day and saves Jane. But Jane's FBI character is still central to the storyline. She is the character who ties in together the other main characters, the reservation sheriff and Game and Fishing official hunter tracker, Cory, as the official investigative team's de facto leader, being the federal authority.
7) A flashback shows the actual crimes. It was a sick tragedy that was orchestrated by one, obnoxious, intoxicated (alcohol always seems to be part of it) security guard team member. Had he not been there to incite his fellow security guard teammates, the rape and murder would never have occurred.",8,0,1,13 March 2018
Darkest Hour," Historical drama of Great Britain's political will to resist Nazi Germany
","The World War II historical event of the British evacuation of it's army from the French beaches of Dunkirk has been covered from the military aspect several times over the past decades. DARKEST HOUR fills the void over what transpired in the British government over that time period, how Great Britain teetered between an armistice with Nazi Germany that would have been a de facto negotiated surrender and continued national resistance. As the movie depicts, it was a close thing. 
First of all, the television commercial preview gives a somewhat misleading perception of 'Darkest Hour' as a more traditional war movie. But that is not the case. The movie is almost wholly human drama back in London amidst the center of political power encompassing Parliament, the House of Commons, the intrigue between its most powerful men, and the involvement of King George V. This movie is not suited for perhaps for younger people but for older fans of historical drama. Make no mistake, it is a high-quality human drama theatrical production and well-worth watching. It would be too dull for children, teens, and young adults.
As the historical drama unfolds, the populace and the government of Great Britain are shaken and fearful in May 1940 as the German Wehrmacht steamrolls over Western Europe, crushes the numerically superior but poorly-led French Army, and forces the British Expeditionary Army reeling back against the sea at the beaches of Dunkirk. But that is just the backdrop for the real movie. 
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, a secretly dying man, his appeasement policies towards Nazi Germany a catastrophic failure, is forced from power. In hindsight, the history books might be too harsh on Chamberlain as an appeaser. Closer examination of contemporary history shows that he was highly supported by the British government, the populace, and the king in the two years leading up to war. In the late 1930s, the once highly nationalistic and jingoistic British and French are a thing of the past. The human meat grinder of WWI have wholly transformed both nations into pacifists, almost at any cost. Despite rearmament by the U.K. and France, both are still unprepared for major war in late 1939. A highly respected, experienced and powerful statesman, Viscount Halifax, is considered by many to be the natural successor.
In historical hindsight it was fortunate for the United Kingdom and for the world that Halifax declined the prestigious job of prime minister. Had it been peacetime, no doubt he would have accepted. But it was desperate national times. Halifax, and many in the British government at the time saw things pessimistically and for legitimate reasons. It was true, Great Britain was still unprepared and underequipped to oppose Nazi Germany. Logically, some kind of peace agreement did make sense. True, but as Great Britain had suffered a serious military defeat on the continent, any peace treaty then and there would no doubt be disadvantageous. Hitler would undoubtedly have demanded harsh terms from the British government. Why not? He was the winner at the time. Halifax, one of the leading members of the peace settlement with Hitler, understood this better than anyone besides Chamberlain and Churchill. An ambitious, highly intelligent man, Halifax was astute enough to recognize history would hold him responsible for any negotiated surrender with Germany, which is what any 'armistice' would have been in May 1940. Halifax did not want that. He declined the prime minister job which went to second choice, compromise candidate, Winston Churchill. Had Churchill agreed with Halifax's demand for peace terms with Hitler, it would have been Churchill's entire fault in the history books. And history would have been changed forever. The movie dramatically shows how even Churchill himself wavered at the critical moment, when he stood alone in defiance of Nazi Germany. Churchill held to his instincts, his natural stubbornness, his unwavering faith in the greatness and power of Great Britain which he witnessed and participated in as a young man, the timely moral and political support of King George V, and his well-advised talks with the British common people. By accident, Churchill's earlier reluctant 'implied' assent to Halifax and Chamberlain to explore peace negotiations through mediator, fascist Italy, got both men off his back temporarily, giving Churchill more breathing space and room to act. The crowning moment arrived in the House of Commons when Churchill rallied all parties, essentially the entire government, behind him to continue the war against Nazi Germany. Chamberlain gave his quiet assent (he would pass away 6 months later) and Viscount Halifax fell from power, later to be dispatched by Churchill to the USA to purchase armaments and supplies for the national war effort. And the rest is destiny and final victory on May 8, 1945.",9,2,7,22 December 2017
A Quiet Place," Excellent sci-fi/horror movie. What are the monsters?
","A QUIET PLACE is an excellent, well-scripted and well acted science fiction/horror hybrid movie, in the vein of Alien. You don't see too many movies of that unique Hollywood niche too often.I'm not going to rehash all the great things about this excellent sci-fi/horror hybrid movie that everyone mentioned. You can read it for yourself. I'll discuss more about the movie's monsters.SPOILERS:The movie begins after the creatures have wrought their world-wide destruction and virtually depopulated the planet. The movie never explains where the apex horrid monster predators originated. That was part of the storyline suspense theme. It's possible that in the movie the unfortunate citizens and their governments never discovered the creatures' origins.For my money you can rule out, 1) supernatural origin, and, 2) earthly origin. There's nothing to indicate some supernatural or preternatural character of the monsters. They operate equally well in daylight and night. The creatures are shown late in the movie to be completely biological fiends. There's nothing to indicate the creatures originated from earth. It would have taken millions of years for such creatures to evolve but more, the biological structure of the creature has no evolutionary antecedent from whence it could have evolved. The physiology and biology of the creatures do not fit any earth lifeform biological architecture, meaning, it couldn't have evolved here. That leaves the last, logical explanation. The monster creatures are of extraterrestrial origin. But that is never confirmed in the movie because the premise is that it doesn't matter where the creature monsters originated; they're here on earth and they've killed off virtually all humans but also prey on animals as well.As you're sitting in the theater, you can piece together the unexplained beginnings in your own mind, that predate the starting date of the movie, '89 days'. Looking at all the missing people signs and scattered newspapers give you an idea of what happened over 89 days ago. That is when the monster creatures arrived/appeared on earth, perhaps accidentally introduced from a crashed alien cargo spaceship. The creatures are sightless and rely almost solely on their extreme keen hearing, as much as humans rely on eyesight. At first the creatures keep out of sight and stay low. People begin disappearing here and there and missing people signs go up. At some point in time the creatures are probably more numerous and more bold when they discover just how easy prey humans are. The creatures emerge from the shadows and openly attack people, day and night. The world's governments are caught totally by surprise. The creatures prove extremely difficult to kill, their exoskeleton is armored, they possess extreme speed and agility and their bodily limbs and structure are a whirling mass of sharp, knife-like claws and razor sharp teeth. Humankind has encountered an apex predator far above them. It's impossible for humans not to make sounds and in little time the cities and towns have been extinguished of people by these monsters.I can't help but feel the same as another poster here. The concept of the blind, keen-hearing monster creatures seems very derivative of the creatures from the TREMORS movie series. The first creatures were subterranean and hunted by sound and vibration. The next evolved generation of those creatures emerged from underground and had developed two legs and hunted by opening the tops of their heads and detecting by heat signature. The monster creatures in A Quiet Place do the same and that shows the weak spot in their armored carapace. Not only do the monster creatures open the sides of their heads to expose their auditory organs for better hearing, they often open up their heads like a flower pedal for optimal detection, but it exposes the soft, vulnerable inner parts. I won't give away more but you can fathom the creatures' ultimate weakness and how it's finally used against them. My advice. Go watch the movie and find out for yourself.",8,1,3,7 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," See this movie for yourself. It's very entertaining and worth it
","BIG SPOILERS. Don't read this review if you haven't seen the movie yet and don't want to know what happens.The Last Jedi is earning mega-bucks around the world and yet is garnering particularly vicious reviews here on imdb. Something is going on and I suspect some kind of angry troll campaign to trash the movie. I judge movies on entertainment value. Did I feel entertained when I leave the movie theater? The answer here is a resounding yes. Watch The Last Jedi and judge it on its own merits for yourself.SPOILERS*******SPOILERS********SPOILERS
So what is the current situation in the Star Wars Galaxy?The Last Jedi can be applauded for trying its best to avoid clichés. You expect some daring gamble to work out and it doesn't. The story doesn't truly end on a happy note.The Resistance has basically sacrificed itself to slow down the First Order, but that is it. By movie's end, we know we have been set up for another big sequel. The Resistance destroyed the First Order Death Planet in the first movie back in 2015. The Resistance destroyed a First Order dreadnought battleship, assassinated Supreme Leader Snoke (indirectly), destroyed Snoke's massive flagship, large numbers of tie fighters and scores of stormtroopers. But as shown, the First Order can absorb these losses and is only delayed, if slightly. The First Order still possesses its small fleet of Star Destroyers. It presumably has reserves of stormtroopers, and Supreme Leader Snoke proved replaceable. Kylo Ren quickly assumed leadership. General Hux survived the battle and the First Order has firm, experienced leadership. The Resistance has lost all of its star ship assets, almost all its manpower and is down to a handful of people, counting General Leia and Rey, the key people, plus the obsolescent but still functional Millenium Falcon. The Resistance is down to...nothing. My guess is that the sequel will show the Outer Rim planets building and funding a new rebel Alliance. The First Order still possesses the winning hand. The New Republic is finished. Its senate, government center and main, inner planets that comprise the important leadership of the New Republic have been incinerated in the first movie. A third Republic will have to be created by the surviving New Republic planets, most located far away from the galaxy center and near or at the Outer Rim. It all makes for a good suspense sequel since basically the Resistance has been defeated and destroyed. The New Republic has been liquidated. More, the Jedi Order has finally come to an end as it used to exist, the last master, Luke Skywalker passing away and the Jedi Tree and its books, now considered irrelevant, are burned to the ground by the spirit of Yoda. The First Order, despite some significant losses and the death of its leader, is still very much alive and dangerous. The First Order is still in a position to move back into former New Republic space and restore the Empire. There's nothing to stop them. So stay tuned for the next sequel in late 2019. Everything will be completely different. If you're like me, you can't wait even though the movie has yet to be even written.",9,1,3,10 January 2018
Hotel Mumbai," Gripping recounting of the Mumbai terror attacks and in the Taj Hotel
","One of my vivid memories in October 2008 watching the live news coverage of the Mumbai terror attack against the world-renown Taj Hotel was of a newsman saying that the Indian authorities were fighting a terrorist inside the hotel but the problem is that they didn't know how many terrorists were inside. This movie answers the question, more than one of course.
I'm suspicious of the many, low, one-star ratings posted on imdb which leads me to suspect a clandestine campaign to undermine the movie for opaque reasons. As a moviegoer from last night, I can definitely tell everyone that HOTEL MUMBAI had me sitting on the edge of my seat. Contrary to negative reviews, I didn't encounter any tedious, slow points in the movie. Everything was well paced if it didn't pertain to the actual terrorist attack itself. When the terrorists strike Mumbai and then the Taj Hotel, the movie moves into high gear and you're on a fast-moving amusement park ride which you cannot get off. You experience almost first hand the terror of the guests and hotel staff, many of which could not avoid their violent deaths, so sudden was it. It is a tale of survival against the odds and the ability to cope with such a life-and-death situation in which impromptu leaders have to be agreed upon and quick decisions have to be made that result in either survival, even if just for the time being or instant, violent death. There is no time for the movie to go into character development and that was not its purpose, but to give a quick snapshot of the lives of ordinary people, celebrities, the wealthy, and the hotel staff just trying to earn a decent living in an overcrowded, smog-choked, polluted Indian city with a long historical past. The movie, I believe does its best to avoid clichÃ©s while being forthright about how people would behave in such a life-and-death situation. You feel sympathy for the main character, an experienced, polished Sikh waiter played by Dev Patel, a man living in the many overcrowded Mumbai slums with his wife and infant son, doing his best to eke out a living, lucky to have a good job as a high-end waiter in a five-star Mumbai hotel, thinking only of his wife and child all the time. The movie even makes you feel sympathetic for the wealthy British Iranian woman, Zahra, who is initially presented as a stereotype spoiled, rich diva, who gets her bath water temperature measured precisely at 48 degrees by hotel staff but we quickly learn is a nice diva, not a nasty one. She married out of love for a tall, blonde, blue-eyed American architect, David, obviously below her social station and her love is deep and true as will be her tragedy.
So I write, disregard the suspicious naysayers with one-star ratings and short reviews that are one sentence or less. See the movie for yourself. I go to movies for the entertainment, not to be bedazzled by some, deep-thought, existential, cosmic Hollywood wannabe that critics feel obliged to rate highly. If I walk out the theater feeling entertained, then the movie succeeded. A movie can succeed in its intent to disturb and HOTEL MUMBAI will no doubt leave you disturbed by the violence and malevolence of its portrayed, heartless terrorist killers, that were accurately described by one reviewer as, being like the android terminators of Hollywood.",9,17,42,23 April 2019
Con Air," Martial artist's worst self-defense nightmare
","My post is not about Con Air per se but about the movie's beginning. For every honest, decent, honorable person who has studied martial arts for the respectable purpose of self-defense, Con Air presents a realistic scenario of how everything can go wrong for the law-abiding citizen who defends himself.For starters, the laws of this nation defining 'self defense' have long been established by lawyer politicians and judges who never studied self-defense and more, have never been in a self-defense situation. It's possible a few have served in the military but that doesn't mean they experienced combat. Therefore the laws defining what the law-abiding citizen can and cannot do have been written by politicians who harbored only a vague sense of what legal self-defense should be. They never took into account just how fast and chaotic any life-and-death self-defense situation can be and the victim is not always in the position to determine just what constitutes enough self-defense that a 'reasonable' person would be expected to commit. This term, 'reasonable' and 'reasonable of amount of force' comes up repeatedly in the laws defining self-defense and deliberately cultivates an element of subjective uncertainty that is left up to the jury and judge to decide. The victim is still considered to be a law-abiding citizen and therefore is subject to strict compliance with the subjective laws of self-defense while the criminal aggressor of course is free to use whatever means of violence he chooses. Also bear in mind that the politicians and judges who framed our nation's laws of self-defense; many, not all, greatly disdained violent responses to personal attack because to them it broke the laws of civilization, introduced the law of the jungle and regressed society to the Old West frontier. While you can't pass laws restricting the criminal's violent crime they could pass laws restricting the law-abiding citizen's ability to defend himself.The set-up in Con Air is pretty stereotypical. Decent man, former US Army ranger, Cameron Poe, celebrates his return home with his beautiful wife in a local bar. And there's the stereotype villain, an obnoxious, drunk, horny, local white lowlife, dressing, looking, and speaking the part. And he has two, silent, lowlife buddies with him to give him courage. Drunk white trash lowlife makes obnoxious, lewd comments to Poe and his wife. Poe and wife put down the idiot and do the right thing, leave the dive. Since the white trash drunk lowlife has two buddies with him, he feels invincible in deciding to thrash the impertinent, clean-shaven Army boy, and maybe get in some rape fun with his wife. Well, that's how it is with bullies, isn't it? They always need to have a couple of guys backing them up. Had the slob been alone, he may have thought twice about going out in the rain to confront Poe (Nicholas Cage). Now the laws of self-defense in almost every state declare that Poe and wife retreat from the scene but it doesn't look like they have much opportunity to do so. A guy by himself could try to duck and run but with a woman on his arm that's out of the question, unless he plans on leaving her behind. As might be expected, the lowlife takes a sucker punch swing at Poe, who, counterattacks with fast, well-placed military combatives hand strikes, one of which, the palm heel strike to the nose, kills the lowlife. His two buddies immediately desert the scene. At the trial comes the nightmare. You hear nothing from Poe's lawyer, who stands silently like a store mannequin ten feet away from Poe as if he had some communicable disease. You get the sense Poe's defense lawyer was worthless to a tee. Then comes the judge who immediately shows his left-wing liberal views on self-defense by declaring Poe the aggressor and the criminal, simply because he had military combatives training and, '...should have known better.' Should have known better, what? How was Poe to know? Men have died from a single punch to the face/head from an untrained assailant and it's happened twice in southern California over the past five years. During a fracas at local baseball park in southern California, a normal, healthy 5'10' man took a punch in the face from another fan. The man collapsed and died two days later.Now the laws of self-defense being what they are, when you kill someone in self-defense, a lot has to go into consideration. Typically killing an assailant armed with a deadly weapon usually (hopefully) ends with no prison time provided there was no escape option for the victim. Most of the time these situations involved house break-ins with armed burglars. But out in the street, fist-to-fist, it gets murkier. Killing someone in what the judge considers a bar brawl is not self-defense in his mind. You might blame the defense lawyer for not being eloquent or persuasive enough with the judge and jury. When you kill someone in a fistfight often the law declares you guilty of negligent homicide, be it manslaughter or second degree homicide. So you are going to jail. But the jail term should not be as long as Poe received, ten years. The judge could have sentenced him to three years to seven years. With time off for good behavior, Poe could have been out of jail in as little as 18 months to 3 years. Poe would still be vulnerable to a wrongful death lawsuit from the dead man's relatives but that's another worst case scenario.As you contemplate self-defense, know from the experts that it is chaotic, unscripted and thousand things can go wrong. But in the split seconds that you have, you take the risk, especially as in Poe's case, he could have been badly injured, even killed by three men, with the possibility of his wife been sexually assaulted afterwards, which in this movie was a distinct possibility given the lust the drunk lowlife exhibited to Poe's wife.",7,2,3,17 April 2018
The Godfather," The three sons are a tragedy in themselves
","I read the paperback book, 'The Godfather', when I just became a teenager. The book and the movie are rare for both being excellent, which is why both received high awards.I found the book riveting and I couldn't put it down. But being an innocent young teenager I was horrified by the violence that men can do to men. The character of Luca Brazzi was terrifying, even though it was just fiction. Even the actor who played him, a former, 6'6' wrestler, was perfect for depicting the quiet, smoldering malevolence as a family 'company' man who took care of the family's enemies in frightening, brutal ways. It was no literary surprise when the Brazzi character met his own brutal karma end.It's easier to gain an assessment of Don Corleone's three sons, Sonny, Fredo, and Michael watching the movie while the book does go into better detail.In the book/movie, Michael, the reluctant son, proves the most capable in the intelligence, cunning, and amorality of his father as his two older brothers fall by the wayside. Yet the whole tragedy is that Michael wanted to be a good man of ethics and morals and would have been a very decent man in a normal family. Fredo, the middle brother was also born in the wrong family. Portrayed as the weak brother, Fredo's weakness was that he completely unsuited mentally, psychologically, and emotionally for life in a crime family and to do the kinds of evil and violent things that would be expected of him. Both men, Fredo, and Michael, would have flourished in normal, middle-class to upper middle-class families. It was the eldest son, Sonny (Santino) who possessed the strength, charisma, apparent leadership ability but not the deep intelligence, foresight, perception, self-control or wisdom to lead the Corleone family.For me the tragedy is not so much the violence or the Corleone family but the two younger brothers, Fredo and Michael, both of whom sincerely and strongly desired to be good men. Fredo's inner weakness led him to betrayal and his ultimate end. Michael's love for his father and family led him to sacrifice the life of a good man for that of an evil crime boss who could give the orders to kill enemies without hesitation and emotion and no regrets.",9,0,0,23 November 2017
