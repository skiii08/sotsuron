The Ring," an assault on your senses
","Be careful with this one!  It accomplishes exactly what it wants to.  The acting is excellent, and the plot is quite intriguing and mysterious.  You will leave the theatre thinking about what actually happened and trying to put all the links together, while at the same time not feeling lost. 
That said, this is not your typical scary movie.  This does not use foreshadowing and suspense music in the traditional way.  Most horror films will build the suspense with foreshadowing, but this also allows you to be prepared when the freaky stuff shows up.  In the ring, you have no clue when its gonna hit you.....that is combined with the fact that the scenes are more gruesome and brutal than any ive ever seen.  It can be a bit much.  The scenes don't really make you jump so much as cringe deep down inside, with a hellascious spine tingle to boot.  This is the kind of movie that will give you nightmares for a long time if you are prone to that sort of thing.  It assaults you in a more subliminal way, in a way you have never experienced before, and the effect is much more lasting and powerful.The screen is usually filled with terrible images, and you should keep this in mind before you enter the theatre.  Be in the mood for a chill, and you'll love this one.  If you are looking for a 'scream' type thriller look else where.  The is no quirky fun here.",8,0,0,24 October 2002
The Hunger Games," Didn't read the book - but ugh
","If you are going to make a movie about children being forced to kill each other for the enjoyment of the public, I would think that the tone one would reach for would be something more along the lines of Shindler's List or at least a tone of some satirical value. And you would think that the angst, fear, disgust and overall awfulness for the main characters would be a focal point. You would think the blood lust of the watching masses would form a visceral sense of at least moderate horror that would serve as a backdrop to all of this. And most of all you would think that children, even children raised to expect that they might someday have to enter a tournament like this, would struggle with a conflict between fear, innocence, longing for some sense of decency and trying to sort through the confusion to survive. It is something of a stretch to imagine a society in which everyone loves seeing children murder each other. That in itself is a plot line the brings a distorted feeling with it. The movie tries to hide that, or at least neglects to even attempt to address that, by layering this movie in and American Idol feeling. There is no sense of outrage. There is hardly a whiff of the sense of all of this in the time we spend with the characters. They are wooden and whitewashed. The most we get in the way of a sense of their overarching dilemma is a few shallow feeling comments and silent looks of stoic concern. The movie seems to present the material in this fashion to make us forget that we are watching children kill each other. It is as though we are watching running man - only with 8 year olds. Who doesn't want to watch a movie where adorable little boys and girls snap each other necks? Or dogs run them down and eat them alive...?If a movie like this is to be done it cannot avoid the moral content without seeming shallow and absently depraved. That is this movie. The core is not attempted. It is like red tails meets running man. I found it absent, vapid and obviously lacking in any real value. It was also a little sick because it didn't even bother for tone whilst presenting the viewer with a mind bending plot. In short, wooden acting, shallow presentation and not at all smart.",1,143,212,1 April 2012
Ocean's Twelve," Not good
","Look for those of you that are interested in experientation with camera angles, strange off beat music, and disjointed story telling, then fine, discuss this film and enjoy. For those of you (and that is most of you) that saw the first one, loved it and its presentation then this is going to be a disappointment. Oceans 12, is a long, plodding, confusing, unslick assault on your senses that leaves you feeling like you have been had. THe first was fun, engaging and flowed. This one is an experiment in movie making and is not fun, does not pull you in and flows like a sinking oil tanker. The first gave a certain impression. The advertising played off of that impression and furthered it. Somebody lied. I am mad that i wasted my money on this. Don't you do the same.",4,18,35,13 December 2004
Salt," Looking forward to the sequel
","In thinking about this movie afterward I was left with the impression that this movie could arguably be labeled 'a female version' of the Bourne Identity. I would disagree slightly with this characterization however in that there are some worthwhile distinctions.This film is at least slightly (if not more so) darker than Bourne in my opinion, and to me that makes this film touch home more.Jolie also does a very admirable job with her non verbal expressiveness. Because of this and because of the fact that the writing gives us good insight into her back story, I found myself more enmeshed with this character than with Bourne (don't get me wrong – Damon did a great job – it is just that I liked the overall 'taste' of Salt more).Even though the action sequences are extreme, they were surprisingly not over the top for me. The movie flowed well and ended in a satisfying manner. In the end, I really liked the Salt character and would prefer her to another Bourne movie, though I think the two are quite comparable overall.",7,9,18,29 July 2010
Tropic Thunder," Bad - really quite horrible
","I am not sure how this movie and Pineapple Express are getting the ratings that they are. This movie is ridiculous to the point of total stupidity and then some. There are some funny moments and some funny lines but this movie is so ridiculous that there is not really anything to hold you to the plot.For example, the main antagonist is maybe 9 years old and the apparent leader of the opposing drug running army. Funny in concept perhaps, but really dumb on screen. If I wanted to watch stand up i wouldn't be at the movie theater. I would like some kind of realistic plot to follow.Jack Black is kind of stifled in his role, while Ben Stiller seems to be allowed to do whatever he wants. Its like night at the improv.I think Robert Downey Junior is sort of brilliant, but he isn't used very well and it gets boring due to the crapola splattered ALL over the screen.Don't go.",3,22,45,1 September 2008
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Fun, funny, good - only slight spoilers
","I found this film to be fun, humorous and upbeat. It wasn't sappy or feel good. It doesn't look like it was made by Walt Disney and Co. It also is not a film noir like War of the Roses. It is a tongue in cheek look at two people who didn't really give a whole lot of thought to why they got together but they were so into each other they just did it - they got married - and promptly went about ruining it by acting like a typical married couple following their idea of what married people are like. They lied to each other about their real lives and acted domestic. It is revealed fairly quickly that they are both hitters and they go about the process of discovering whether their relationship is based on something real, while at the same time thinking about whether or not to kill each other as their 'bosses' demand that they do.Good acting, obvious chemistry, sexy and humorous fun. I really enjoyed it and all the people at the theater seemed very happy with it as well. If you want an entertaining night without the political intrigue or thoughtful intellect, go to this one. It is worth the money.",8,3,6,29 June 2005
Pineapple Express," Some really funny stuff - and overall - just bad
","There were admittedly some very funny scenes, and some very funny lines. It seems however fairly clear that this script was written while he was totally high. This movie is filled with scene after scene that would seem funny in concept if you were high out of your mind but in reality - wow - there is barely even a discernible movie here. It is just a bunch of goofy scenes barely pasted together with any believable plot. If you are a huge pot lover - see this movie. If you are expecting an outrageous and funny comedy - do NOT see this except maybe on the movie channel when you can turn the channel and skip in and out. Think cheech and chong rather than Knocked Up.",3,8,18,15 August 2008
