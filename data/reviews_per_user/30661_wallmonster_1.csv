Requiem for a Dream," Absolutely predictable
","Maybe this movie pushed the envelope when it was released but people who voted this movie into the top 100 need to watch more movies. I watched this movie tonight and anyone could predict the outcome (and each of the events that lead to it) for all four main characters in the first five minutes. The films only attempts at twists are in easily predicted fantasies and delusions. Aside from Sara I found it impossible to relate to or have any compassion for any of the remaining characters. I wished that the film makers would just hurry up and bring their story lines to their obvious conclusions. It's not that it's a horrible movie it's just ridiculously overrated ala Fight Club, Pulp Fiction etc... Not that it's a bad way to kill off a couple of hours but you won't strain any brain cells.",4,1,5,11 September 2007
