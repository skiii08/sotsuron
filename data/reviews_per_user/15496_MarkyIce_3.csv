Ali," Smith tries, but it's just not there...
","Maybe if they'd trimmed the first hour of the film out, it would have been okay.  I found the whole Malcom X thing to be a complete bore.  I respect the religion and what Malcom X tried to do, but I just didn't think it tied in with Ali's life.  Perhaps that's because the whole thing jumped around with no explanation at all as to what was happening.  There probably is a very interesting connection and relationship between Ali and X, too bad the director couldn't do any justice to it.  Will Smith doesn't do a bad Ali, and he's actually making sure that he's not in the Sly Stallone boxing shape because Ali was never a body builder, but some of the lines Smith delievers would come off better if it was Ali delivering them.Maybe the movie is worth seeing if you have the time or just want to see a new direction for Will Smith.  If not, turn on ESPN Classic and watch the real Ali - it's much better.",Null,0,0,26 December 2001
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," This Movie Is Highly Overrated
","I watched this in my film class and expected something great.  After all, it was ranked so highly and everyone spoke high praise.After watching it, I was disgusted that a movie like this could be so acclaimed.  'You can't fight in here, this is the war room!' and other lines have often been regarded as funny...no, they aren't funny.  If they are supposed to be funny, they come at points in the movie where you just don't care anymore.  Maybe it's my age and I'm too young too appreciate this or maybe this movie just doesn't hold up well.Kubrick disappoints me often and I cannot recommend this garbage to anyone because it's completely unfunny, uninteresting, and unentertaining.",Null,0,1,12 May 2002
Rocky," One of the Best Movies EVER
","This was the movie that started one of the best series of sports movies ever. However, this movie is not strictly a boxing movie. It's more about heart, determination, and it's even got a good love story packed beneath it all. When I was little, this movie was one of my favorites. I remember faking sick, skipping school, renting this movie on the way home from my mom checking me out, and then going home and watching it. But this is not the kind of movie that you get sick of. It's always fresh and there's never a dull moment.The newer cover of the movie (the older one had Rocky holding Adrian close on it) has a repleca of Rocky after his match with Apollo Creed certainly gives the impression that you'll pop this in and watch 2 hours of boxing. But you pop this in and I ensure you that is not all you will find. In fact, the only real boxing is in the opening and closing scenes.
Overall, this movie was well-worthy of it's Academy Award nominations and wins. * * * * out of * * * *",Null,0,0,1 June 2000
