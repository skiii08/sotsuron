Blade Runner 2049," Great sci-fi action, hampered by plot holes
","Nothing is more infuriating than seeing characters in movies making unrealistic and irrational decisions, which end up changing the plot / story irrevocably. Throughout the movie, the main character makes 3 such irrational decisions that I noticed, that change the outcome of the story (there may be more). One example, without spoiling: At the end of the movie, one character makes a very unrealistic decision in a gun-battle, and it ends up costing this character's life... this was poor writing and it created a plot-hole, since no rational person would have done what this character did in a real gun-battle... and to make it even worse, we have to remember that this character has military-training and is supposed to be a tactically superior to a 'normal rational person'.This is honestly a 8/10 movie, but it's brought down to a 7/10 due to the plot holes. Nonetheless it's a movie that's worth watching, but this movie is even better if you watch the 1982 Blade Runner beforehand.",7,0,3,2 May 2020
Men in Black 3," Time traveling shenanigans
","First off: If they built the prison SPECIFICALLY for Boris, then why was it so damn easy for him to escape? I mean... no death-lazers on the perimeter walls? No land space mines outside? No space ships to stop him from getting back to earth? The whole premise seems to hold very little water... but OK, he escapes and makes it back to earth AND manages to remain undetected on earth long enough to do the time-traveling thing, despite the MIB (whose job it is, to locate rogue aliens on earth) actively looking for Boris, because they know he's escaped and exactly what ship he took.Anyway, despite the plot holes (there's MANY plot-holes in this one), it's still a fun movie and worth a watch, although small kids may find Boris a bit too much to handle, as he IS a pretty damn disgusting looking alien and he impales people against walls with spikes.Also, did I mention all the plot-holes? Damn there's a lot of plot-holes! Like at least 10 of em!",7,0,0,27 September 2019
Come and See," The 2hr22m runtime feels like 6hours
","This movie is basically a documentary which more-or-less shows what it was like back in WW2 from the perspective of Russians. Now I can appreciate that the movie is shot in 1985 and that the director went for a very 'artistic' feel by having the camera on actors' faces for often up to 1minute at a time, but honestly the way that this film was filmed just makes it boring, not 'artistic' at all.They also killed a couple of animals in the movie, including shooting a cow and having it suffer for a while, which is something I HAVE to deduct a few rating points for... I mean, shooting an animal is absolutely fine if it was meant for slaughter in anyway, but shooting it and making it suffer is inexcusable, even if this was 1985 back when things were different, it's still not right.There's also several things in the movie that don't make sense, like at certain scenes in the movie, some actors spoke in a very very deep and rough voice, like they were told by the director 'speak like a demon would'. It makes very little sense and just confuses the hell out of the viewer.The acting is also pretty bad in a couple of scenes, particularly from the 2 main actors (the girl and the boy). I understand that it was both of their first times acting in a movie, but that doesn't excuse the bad casting choice. I mean, sure the girl is distractingly pretty, but she's a poor actor and she has no place in a movie... with her looks maybe in a magazine or pin-up poster, but not in a movie.I'd give the first half of the movie a 2/10 and the second half of the movie a 8/10. So basically, if you want to watch the movie, do yourself a favor and skip to half-way.",4,3,10,28 January 2020
Alien 3," 3 times the budget of Aliens 2... but not any better
","The previous movie had a VERY nice and well-planned segway from Aliens 1 to Aliens 2... but Aliens 3 has ZERO segway and no explanation of why Ripley is no longer on the ship and asleep in her cryopod, as she previously was at the end of Aliens 2... this leaves MANY things unexplained and leaves the viewer scratching their head... they literally didn't care to explain anything, which is just pure laziness...Anyway... this movie has WAY less plot-holes than Aliens 1 or 2, but it's worse wrt. plot and script and acting... so in the end, it's just as bad as the previous movies. This movie has 3 times the budget of Aliens 2 and 4 times the budget of Alien 1, yet the Xenomorph and the CGI looks significantly worse... 5/10",5,0,1,24 May 2020
Skyfall," Plot-hole central... 2 gigantic plot-holes
","The first Bond movie in history, where Bond actually gets shot.Anyways, there's lots of plot holes in the movie: In the one scene, Bond's partner shoots him accidentally, while Bond is in a fish-fight with a bad-guy, yet his partner doesn't then shoot the bad-guy after that... she literally just lets the bad-guy get away, whilst still having a clear shot of the bad-guy for 5seconds after that.. This is a huge plot-hole, as the bad-guy escaped for literally no reason. The ENTIRE movie is based off of this plot-hole, which is pretty sloppy writing. Predicating an entire movie off a single plot-hole makes for a pretty horrible story and spoils the entire experience for the viewer since due to that plot-hole, the entire story has now diverged from reality.Another plot-hole is when Bond literally stands idly by while a bad-guy assassinates someone... There's no way that Bond would allow somebody to die like that... I mean, just look back at the previous films: There's been Bond films where the entire plot predicates on rescuing a single woman or man... And now, Bond just stands by allowing a man to be killed? It goes against the entire creed of the Bond name, and creates a plot-hole.Another plot-hole is the fact that any security agency worth their salt would NEVER plug a foreign device into their own security database... That's the equivalent of you picking up a flashdrive in a Walmart parking lot and plugging it into your work computer... Only colossal idiots would do that, and it's exactly what they did in the movie... It would never happen in real life, and it creates another plot-hole.Overall it's a flawed story, with bad writing. The plot-holes spoil the entire movie, since the entire movie is based on plot-holes. Javier Bardem makes a great bad-guy, eventhough like I said, he wouldn't even be in the movie, if it weren't for the plot-holes and bad writing. The movie is utterly spoiled, and it's too bad since it could have been a good movie.",4,3,5,14 May 2020
Deepwater Horizon," Focuses mainly on the explosion & immediate aftermath, and little on the finer details
","It's sad to think that Transocean/BP lost nothing, and 11 people lost their lives (and who knows how many millions of animals died from the 210million gallons of oil that was spilled).Transocean/BP got at least a $500million insurance payout, and who knows how many billions of dollars they made from the Deepwater Horizon rig in the 10years that they operated it. And NOBODY went to prison. 11 people dead and no repercussions.Anyway, the film is pretty good... I would have liked it if they went into a bit of detail on what all the various terms is that they used like marine riser, annular, EDS, kick, and so on. They used to many terms and jargon that the average viewer is left in the dark. They could maybe even have shown what the capping process looks like in the aftermath of the whole event, as I think the capping process would have been very interesting and would have placed a capper (excuse the pun) on the whole movie.But it's a good movie to watch if you're interested in the whole event, even-though it does offer only a cursory glance at the causes of the disaster, and spends the majority of the time focusing on the panic & mayhem that happened during the actual explosion.",7,2,2,8 May 2020
Se7en," A brilliantly twisted crime-thriller
","A brilliantly twisted crime-thriller about two detectives solving a series of murders. Great acting from Freeman, Pitt and the killer. It's one of those movies where the crescendo comes literally 2 minutes before the credits roll, and it's a beautiful thing... it leaves you awestruck by what just happened, and as you walk out of the cinema back to your car, you're still thinking about the movie, trying to make sense of it all.",9,0,0,9 January 2020
Star Trek," JJ Abrams needs to cool it on the strobe lights
","What on earth goes on in JJ Abrams' head when he tries to blind his audience with those stupid effects? It's like literally in all his movies, and it serves no purpose but to provoke epileptic fits, it seems. Anyway, the movie: It's good. It's got space battles, weird alien species, trials and tribulations, strife between the crew of the ship... everything you'd want in a Star Trek movie. I'm rating it a 7, but as far as 'sci-fi space movies' goes, it's a 8.5",7,9,16,24 September 2019
This Is the End," Amusing, but not funny.
","This is like putting Bruce Willis, Tom Cruise, Keanu Reeves, Jet Li and Chuck Norris into an action film, and then it turning out to a nature documentary about butterflies in the end... I giggled exactly twice... and didn't laugh even once... So many comedy actors (and Emma Watson), and yet they managed to make an unfunny comedy movie... quite remarkable tbh...",4,1,3,24 September 2019
Alien: Resurrection," Weak plot and nonsense story
","Just like the previous Alien movies, this one has a bunch of plot-holes, though not as much as the previous ones... There's a Xeno queen in this movie, yet they never brought a Xeno queen onto their ship, they only had the face-hugger eggs... so it's literally impossible for there to be a Xeno queen in the movie, yet the director didn't care and put one in in anyway, because, you know, 'Xeno queens are cool'... it might be cool, but it creates a large plot-hole.Other than that, this film is by far the one with the least amount of plot-holes out of the 4 Aliens movies... but it's also the worst wrt. plot and story, so it gets a 5/10.",5,0,2,25 May 2020
12 Monkeys," Brad Pitt carries this movie
","As far as 'futuristic-apocalyptic sci-fi movies' goes, it's a really minimalist take on that idea tbh... there's no flying cars or robots, though there is some time-traveling, which really is the extent of the 'futuristic' theme in the movie. The movie was OK, but it fell into a weird little crevice where there's not enough action for it to be considered an action movie, and not enough drama/suspense for it to be considered a full drama either. The movie deals with time-travel AND teleportation, so you'll be left thinking 'WTF just happened?' multiple times in the movie because of it.Brad Pitt's performance in the movie however, out-shines everyone else in the movie... it's so good, his performance is damn near blinding!",7,1,1,8 September 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Not a single laugh...
","I could tell from the trailer of this movie already that it was going to be bad, but just how bad, I wasn't even prepared for. With a cast like Rachel McAdams and Will Ferrell, I was expecting at least a few laughs but this movie is just so very not-funny. I'm a fan of both these actors, but this movie was just plain bad.The acting was OK, and I don't think that was the issue with the movie being un-funny, since we know that both actors can play funny roles... it just really comes down to the plot/story/writing being bad, and it's not the actor's fault.I honestly can't recommend that you watch this movie, under any circumstances... Normally most movies would at least maybe be worth watching if you have nothing else to watch or if you just want to pass some time, but this movie isn't even worth watching if you've got nothing to do for 2hours... I'd recommend rather going outside and looking at the birds flying, or organizing your garage... This is honestly the least funny comedy movie I've watched in a long time.",3,24,70,26 June 2020
Knives Out," Unexpectedly good
","I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but was pleasantly surprised. A good plot, with good pacing and good acting all round (especially by Ana de Armas & Daniel Craig).It's not the best movie all year, but it's certainly in the top 10 I'd say. You're constantly thinking that the person who did it, will be caught (since you, as the viewer, knows exactly who did it, yet the characters don't), and that makes for a great story, eventhough you're misled and lied to at every turn. It's just really really good writing and directing tbh... bravo all round.",8,1,2,27 December 2019
The Irishman," It's OK. I wanted to see more houses getting painted though
","I'm a big fan of Scorsese's works, like Shutter Island, The Wolf of Wall Street, The Departed and Gangs of New York. I've also watched Casino and Goodfellas both 20 times easily! That's how much I like Scorsese's films... but there's something missing in this one. Where as all the films I've mentioned above are rated 8, 9 or 10 by me, I've really struggled to even give this film a 7/10 score... it's simply not the same as his other films.There's CGI on the faces of a few actors in this movie, including De Niro and Joe Pesci. The CGI is quite noticeable. They also made Robert De Niro look like a  vampire in 'Underworld' for some reason... they gave him the bluest eyes EVER. De Niro looks like a Disney Princess in some scenes, with his bright blue eyes, like they put  LED lights in his eyes or something. I mean sure, you're trying to get across that the dude has blue eyes, but holy hell! It's just a too excessive tbh.I wouldn't dissuade anybody from watching this movie, BUT if you want to see Scorsese at his best, then I'd rather recommend one of his other movies like Casino or The Departed, because 'The Irishman' simply isn't the best that Scorsese can do.",7,1,4,28 November 2019
The Fifth Element," The GREENEST sci-fi movie, literally ever!
","This movie is supergreen. CONSTANT action, with spurts of comedy in-between. It's honestly the best sci-fi movie ever. The CGI is absolutely bleeding-edge for the time, and I know what you're gonna ask, and NO: Milla Jovovich's face isn't part of the CGI... THAT'S HER ACTUAL FACE. Milla Jovovich in her prime (22 yrs old). Another testament to how good this movie is, is how many cultural references and memes this movie has spawned over the years since its release. I only wish the movie were longer, not even 2hrs is long enough for this movie... 2hrs40mins would have been more suitable.",9,0,1,24 September 2019
Molly's Game," A great biographical film with superb acting all around
","This film is based on the life of a real life person called Molly Bloom (her wikipedia page is an interesting read). The film has some great actors such as Idris Elba, Chris O'Dowd, Jessica Chastain and Kevin Costner, but honestly even the supporting actors play their roles well.This film gives an interesting insight into the legality (and illegality) of self-run poker games and provides an interesting look at the loopholes of the american justice system as well.It's a great film if you're even just mildly curious about gambling, gambling addition, or poker.",8,3,4,22 March 2020
Barry Lyndon," As long as LotR, but no magic or Orcs
","This 3hr1minute melodrama, is the story of a foolish country-boy who becomes a rich traveler, and then becomes a poor soldier, then an army deserter, then a poor soldier again, then a spy, then a double-agent, then a card-hustler, then the husband of a Lady, then a poor divorcee and finally a card-hustler once again...It's a story that has action, drama, romance, comedy and adventure all rolled into one movie, as it follows the story of a fellow named Barry.It's not a movie that I'd ever rewatch again tbh, but I'm happy that I watched it once.",8,0,0,27 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Disney is the Dark Side. This ONE Disney movie undid 40 years of quality writing and character progression
","Disney is disgusting. They destroyed over 40 years of George Lucas' hard work.All Jedis can heal all of a sudden? NOT EVEN YODA COULD HEAL!Palpatine who was CONFIRMED DEAD by the creator of Star Wars, is now alive in this Disney abomination? There goes 40 years of CanonSince when do Yedi just DISAPPEAR after dying? Since Disney took over, that's when!Why did the two characters at the end kiss? Why? There was ZERO romance between them through 3 different movies, and now they kiss? Disney.....And the SADDEST thing about all of this, is that Disney will still own the franchise when the next trilogy is released after 2021... that means that this whole abomination will be allowed to continue under the thumb of Disney and its greed.",5,7,12,29 March 2020
Pacific Rim," Plot holes, but otherwise it's 2hrs of sci-fi eye-candy
","Why on earth would you go from being a top-tier pilot for the military, to being a construction worker? That just makes no sense... I know that they did it so that the character that Charlie Hunnam plays would seem like an 'everyman's man', but it simply doesn't make sense.Another thing that doesn't make sense: Why are all the Jaegers (robots) melee? That makes very little sense in reality... why engage with melee Kaiju (monsters) in melee? Why not just build Jaegers that have a crap tonne of missiles and lazer weapons, and blast the Kaiju into another dimension from far away? I know the movie would be drastically different if that were the case, but it would also be much cooler imo, because everyone knows big guns are better than big swords. I just think it's a huge plot hole.But other than the gaping plot-holes that this movie has, the movie is a 2hr trip filled with good CGI and a tonne of sci-fi and action fans will love it. For once though, I'd like to see the main actor+actress NOT end up kissing... it's a completely played-out trope that needs to be put on ice for a few years, honestly.",7,0,0,6 May 2020
Nightcrawler," Gellenhaal is perfect in this role
","The story of a complete sociopath and psychopath, as told through the lens of Jake Gellenhaal's acting ability. Gellenhaal is truly believable as someone who doesn't care a single bit about anyone else except himself. He manipulates and twists people to better himself and his goals. If you don't know what a sociopath is, or how they operate, then watch this movie.",9,0,0,27 September 2019
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," It's ok
","It's a comedy movie, so you're supposed to laugh a lot right? Well I giggled (not laughed) maybe two or three times in the entire movie... so I'd say it pretty much failed as a comedy movie. Nothing against Lonely Island and their novelty music, but it simply didn't make me laugh, and thus failed for what it set out to do/be.",6,1,3,8 September 2019
Burn After Reading," An absolute cluster... a beautiful, mindless cluster...
","Brad Pitt plays an 'utter idiot' (named Chad) very convincingly. I found his portrayal of the character very humorous. Basically all the characters in the movie are played very well. It's no wonder that with a cast as illustrious as this (Clooney, McDormand, Malkovich, Pitt, Simmons), that the movie turned out to be a very good one.If this was any other movie, that ended as abruptly as this one did, then I'd probably be mad and feel cheated in some way, but honestly when the credits started rolling, I had a smile on my face. It was very well done, but the movie IS too short imo.The Coen brothers are just shockingly good at making movies... the only thing that they could have done to improve the movie, was to make it longer, as 90minutes really isn't enough... if this movie was 120min-150min, then I'd probably have given this movie a 9/10 or even 10/10... but otherwise than that, this movie is fantastic.",8,1,1,17 May 2020
Cast Away," Tom Hanks has a ball
","Hanks' performance in this movie is top-notch. His co-star (the ball) had no actual lines of dialogue in the movie, but you can just FEEL the emotions coming through from the ball's performance. Honestly, I was surprised that the ball didn't at least get nominated for best supporting actor.Anyway, it's Hanks on an island dealing with what you'd expect... Sand in all the wrong places... Nothing but coconuts to eat... And not a single pretty lady to keep him company...Great performance from Hanks and a great film overall",8,1,2,4 February 2020
Armageddon," Incredibly unrealistic, but still a fun 2hrs20min
","Steam, wind, sound and gravity on an asteroid flying through space? Yeah the director didn't really think this whole 'space thing' through (or I think he simply didn't care... he was just like: 'Meh, let's just make it fun'). And the movie is pretty fun, if you ignore the obvious inconsistencies and plot holes. Just take it like this: It's a movie of Bruce Willis and his team of misfits attempting to save the world by going to outer-space and blowing up a giant asteroid that's hurtling towards earth. PS. Liv Tyler at 21 y/o was unbelievably beautiful... she's distractingly gorgeous in the movie.",7,12,13,24 September 2019
Split," M. Night Shyamalan's 2nd best film
","One guy playing many different characters isn't done very often, and when it's done, it's usually done poorly, but James McAvoy did it very well in this movie... his portrayal is very believable.Overall, it's an excelent film and especially so if you watch Glass (2019) after you've watched this movie. The ending of this movie is also very surprising and well done.It's M. Night Shyamalan's best film, after Unbreakable (2000).",8,0,0,17 January 2020
Collateral," Cruise's only ever portrayal of a villain in his entire career
","First plot-hole: A professional hitman or professional assassin would ALWAYS have a silencer on his gun, so that's the first major plot-hole in the movie... it makes no sense that a professional would want to attract unneeded attention to themselves... and in the movie, the fact that he DOESN'T have a silencer does indeed end-up in him getting noticedAfter that the movie progresses fine but later on another plot-hole appears due to Tom Cruise's character not wearing a seatbelt and not making Jamie Foxx's character stop the car... he could EASILY have made him stop the car (like by hitting him in the head with his gun), yet he didn't and that created a plot-hole... a massive plot-hole in fact, which changed the course of the entire movie.Overall it's an interesting movie and it's an important film because it's the first (and only) time ever that Tom Cruise played the bad guy (Tropic Thunder doesn't count because he was a supporting character only and he wasn't a bad guy either, he was just a corporate a$shole). Who knows if he will EVER do another movie as the villain? It's been 16 years and he hasn't done it again, so my guess is not... so until then, this movie will stand as a testament to Cruise's ability to play an evil character. A solid 6.5/10 action movie.",7,0,0,17 May 2020
The Usual Suspects," Didn't leave me breathless, but it's good
","One of those movies that almost gets better the 2nd time that you watch it... It's a movie that some people will find boring, but not me personally... I found the whole 'following the bread crumbs' theme interesting and on your 2nd viewing you actually notice a lot of the stuff you weren't even aware of the 1st time. Can't talk too much about the movie since lots of stuff would be a spoiler, but honestly it's just a good 'crime investigation' movie. Worth a watch",8,1,1,8 January 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Plot-holes galore!
","It also has several plot-holes... They need to hire better script writers, since plot-holes like this are very easily avoided, yet they can ruin an entire franchise's continuity (which is exactly what has happened here).Thanos snapped away half of all people right? To solve overpopulation right? Because his planet & people suffered from overpopulation right? SO WHY THE HELL would he then do what he did with the stones, in just a few generations the population of the galaxy will be back where it was and more overpopulated than ever? It's the most stupid plot hole ever.Another HUGE plot-hole: There's NO WAY that a human could wield a single Infinity Stone, never mind all of them at once so that blows a huge hole in the whole last 30minutes of the movie and all future movies, since what happened is impossible. A human would die instantly if they wielded that much power.Hire better damn writers!",6,3,9,7 October 2019
Quantum of Solace," Too short; huge anti-climax
","This movie is the first movie in the whole Bond franchise that has no significant plot-holes, but it's also probably the weakest execution of any plot so far...I spotted only two plot-holes in the movie, but they were so minor that I won't even bring them up... anyway, the plot/story is interesting, but it falls down flat due to the fact that they never allow the bad-guy enough time to actually execute his master plan... the movie could have easily been 30-45minutes longer, which would have allowed for adequate time to more thoroughly build the arc for the bad-guy.Unfortunately the bad-guy's plan never comes anywhere close to fruition, and Bond spends half of the movie chasing after a girl who he's never even met before. It would have been 7/10, if only it was longer.",5,0,1,13 May 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The 2nd worst Tarantino movie so far & still pretty good
","The 2nd worst Tarantino movie so far... still, that amounts to a 7/10 movie and it's still pretty good as far as movies go... The movie spends way too much time on unnecessary things and way too little time on the Manson 'family'. I'd have liked to see more time spent on them, to at least see Tarantino's interpretation of them flushed out a bit more.I DO hope however that Tarantino will release a directors cut edition of the film, and hopefully show like at least 20mins+ more of scenes that didn't make the theatrical cut, which shows more of the stuff that traditional Tarantino movies are renowned for. THAT would be a treat.",7,0,2,23 November 2019
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not as good as 1 or 2
","If Magneto can pick up an entire bridge, then why didn't he just drop the bridge ontop of the island compound where the little boy was being kept? I mean, Magneto's intention all along was to kill the boy, so why not just drop a damn bridge on him? Plot holes like that make me lose all immersion when it comes to movies.... and if you're not immersed in a movie, then you're not enjoying the movie. Other than that massive plot hole, the movie is OK",6,1,1,27 September 2019
Kick-Ass," Finally! Comic-book hero movies for adults!
","It's not a kids movie, let's get that out of the way... This movie is meant for adults and actually fills a very small niche in the 'adult comic-book heroes' catagory... There's plenty of movies that have 'comic-book heroes' but they are ALL rated GA or TA... but Kick-Ass 1/2 are rated MA, and that's what makes the film unique. The ONLY other 'comic-book heroes' movie aimed at adults that comes to mind is Super (2010) (which is very good btw).So here's the facts: Kick-Ass 1/2 fills a void which previously was only filled by Super (2010), and Kick-Ass 1/2 is actually a pretty good movie too. It's not the best movie on earth, but it scratches an itch which literally only 1 other movie before it has done... and that makes Kick-Ass 1/2 very valuable.",8,0,0,22 October 2019
Men in Black II," More of the pug please! And less plot holes
","Features the Pug (Frank) a whole lot, and he wears a suit for a few seconds on screen, which is just so cute... they honestly should feature the pug more often or make a spin-off for him. Anyway:Huge plot hole: How can Serleena, walk into MIB headquaters and not get detected and also not even have a single gun pointed at her once she's discovered? I mean, it's the freeking MIB headquaters... there's like 100 agents and 1000 guns, but yet not a single weapon is fired and not even pointed at Serleena... and then nearly at the end of the movie, in the MIB headquaters, Agent J shoots Serleena with a single bullet from his weapon, which blows Serleena into a million pieces... why didn't they just shoot Serleena back when there were 100 agents around her? it's a huge plot hole tbh.And what's with the unrealisticness? Agent Z jumps in the air and does 20 mid-air kicks to Serleena's face... what the heck? Why even put such an unrealistic scene in the movie?Overall, MIB2 is OK, it's worse than MIB1 and MIB3, but atleast it's better than MIB4.",6,0,0,27 September 2019
1917," I wasn't 'wow-ed' but it's still a good war movie
","It's a solid 8/10 war movie but it has problems, the biggest of which is: There's several times in this movie where the main character makes IDIOTIC choices, which directly disadvantage him and puts himself and others into peril. It's honestly poor writing, for the sake of building the drama/suspense... but having the main character in your movie make stupid descisions simply to raise the suspense level is a very scummy writing tactic because the writer hopes that the viewer won't notice it (sorry, but I noticed).As far as the plot goes, it's a good plot, although the main character being a pacifist is dumb and honestly the movie would have been much better if they made the main character not be a pacifist... I mean, it's a battlefield in World War 1, so why would you make your main character a pacifist? I don't really object to it, I just know that the movie would have been better if he actually used his gun a bit more, but hey, they chose to make him a pacifist so it results in a movie with less action and thus in my opinion it's a more boring movie.And the 'one long shot' gimic is done adequately though it's not as good as Birdman (2014), and you can very easily see the moments that the next scene starts because there's always something passing between the field of focus and the camera (that's when you know a cut was made). Anyway, it's a cool gimic which is executed adequately but not executed as well as in Birdman.There's also 2 large plot-holes at 1hr2mins into the movie... Without spoiling anything, I'll just say: Why would the german target 1 lone guy, instead of a whole squad? In real war, any soldier would have JUMPED at the opertunity to shoot as many enemy soldiers as he could... And the 2nd plot-hole here is that it is exactly 55sec from the time that they dropped him off, until the first gunshot goes off, and in 55sec they would be MAYBE 800meters away from him (assuming they drove at 50km/h, which is being generous for army trucks on mud roads), so they would absolutely have heard the gunshots, and would have turned around to render aid to him, which would have changed the course of the entire movie.Overall, it's a good war movie and it'll keep you entertained for 1hr50mins. There ARE better war movies out there, like Fury (2014) or Saving Private Ryan (1998) which are both 10/10 movies, but this one is still a fine war movie at 8/10.",8,1,2,19 January 2020
Jurassic World," Very good. Worthy of being called a sequel
","Movie's title should have been: 'Dinosaur breaks out an kills stuff #4'Jurassic Park 1, 2, 3 were all very good (especially for their time), so when this movie (Jurassic Park 4) was announced after so many years, I was dubious, but Colin Trevorrow (director) did a great job.The movie has tonnes of action, same as the previous films had, and it followed almost exactly the same formula as the previous films: Stupid humans cause a dinosaur to break out and go on a kill-rampage.Chris Pratt delivers a good (albeit smug+cocky) performance, and Bryce Dallas Howard plays the workaholic love-interest well too... but for once I would just like to see the 'I'm so damn incompetent that I need a man's strong muscles to help in EVERY situation' trope NOT being used in movies that have a male+female lead.Anyway, unlike 'Jurassic World 2' (2018), this movie is very well directed and I have very little criticism of the movie, although there are several scenes where the humans are absolute idiots, and they handle situations in very unrealistic ways which often end up getting themselves killed.Still, good movie and totally worth watching. Just avoid watching 'Jurassic World 2' (2018) as it is significantly worse than any of the previous 4 Jurassic Park movies... Fortunately I hear that Colin Trevorrow is making a return to direct the next Jurassic Park 6 film so that is some good news... they fortunately realised their massive error in letting that other guy direct Jurassic Park 5.",8,0,0,5 May 2020
The Insider," 'I believe that nicotine is not addictive'
","And that statement, cost the tobacco industry $368 billion in 1995. This movie tells the story of the whistle-blower that exposed the evil tactics of the tobacco industry and how they made their products not only more addictive but also more deadly.The film could possibly have been done better, but at 8/10 it certainly is worth watching if you're unaware about this massive scandal that broke in 1995 involving the tobacco industry and how they KNEW that their product was deadly and addictive and yet they lied in supreme court.",8,0,0,18 June 2020
Taken," Kidnap MY daughter will you?!!!
","This was Liam Neeson's breakout role and it solidified him as a badass action star. It unfortunately also resulted in him being type-casted for the rest of his career, but honestly he plays the role of 'action hero' pretty well. He has made some pretty bad movies since then, but he's also made some good ones, so you can't really blame him for being a little overzealous with the roles that he's accepted since this hit-role he' had.Anyway, the movie is very good... They kidnap his daughter and he goes on a rampage... It's a tried and tested trope and it's particularly well executed in this movie.Making Taken 2 and 3 might have been overreaching a bit but you can't really expect them to be as good as this one is.",8,1,2,4 February 2020
The Fly," Excellent, for it's time
","An excellent horror movie for the time (1986). The make-up and specially effects are excellent and still hold-up even today, more than 30 years later. Geena Davis's performance leaves a lot to be desired, but fortunately the focus of the film is placed largely on Jeff Goldblum, whose performance is excellent as always. The film is very slowly paced, as many films were back then, so you can't really hold that against the film today. Overall it's a great horror movie",9,1,1,27 August 2019
Titanic," A historic event, sprinkled with some love dust
","This movie is a romantic film, set in the backdrop of the historic sinking of the cruise ship named 'Titanic'. Even if you're not that into romantic movies, this movie still packs enough action and suspense to keep you from falling asleep. The CGI for the time was bleeding-edge and the fact that it was the biggest budget movie ever for its time truly shows. The movie is a spectacle and it's done extremely well.The performances for Leo de Caprio and Kate Winslet isn't anything special but they still deliver believable performances as does the entire cast.Even more than 20 years later, the movie is still extremely watchable and I honestly can't think of a better portrayal of the historic sinking of this massive ship. From the systematic flooding of the cabins below deck to the breaking and snapping of the entire ship into two pieces, its all done extremely well and it all seems very true-to-fact.Overall an amazing cinematic experience and an even better portrayal of an historic event.",9,1,2,4 February 2020
The Departed," Flawless
","It's an absolutely stunning movie. You are constantly left in the dust, just trying to make sense of what just happened, and just when you think you've got a hold of what you just saw on the screen, Scorsese slaps you upside the head and leaves you reeling again. I've literally never given a movie 10/10, this is the first one... and this movie truly deserves it. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is amazing; Matt Damon's performance is top-tier and Mark Wahlberg's character is absolutely hilarious with his character being brilliantly overshadowed by the other characters. Scorsese's best film ever.",10,2,4,27 August 2019
Joker," A good reimagining, but it wasn't needed. Heath Ledger's Joker is perfect.
","The movie's portrayal of the Joker character isn't better than the one in Christopher Nolan's film, so why would you reimagine it? Just seems pointless, because Heath Ledger's Joker was so perfectly done that it can't be topped... unless you're just doing it for the money, well then that's just sad.The movie is a 7.5, which leaves it FAR behind any of the 10/10 Christopher Nolan Batman films.",8,0,3,20 December 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Truth of Wall Street
","The events depicted in this movie didn't just happen once, or twice... It has most certainly happened DOZENS of times in the past 50 years and we just don't know about it. The rampant drug use, prostitutes, drinking and partying, destroying average people's lives, stealing, lying, fraud, corruption: All in the shadow of the biggest money making scheme ever, called Wall Street. This is a true story, of that you can be sure. A few viewers might find the rampant and reckless disregard of morality a bit off-putting, but I honestly think that this movie could have gone further... they didn't show any child prostitution and not any bestiality either, BOTH of which occur on a regular basis in the circles of the hyper-rich elite. It's a great movie to make you realize just how insignificant and meaningless your 9-to-5 daily life really is, when compared to theirs.",9,0,1,27 August 2019
It Chapter Two," Not scary.
","It's supposed to be a scary movie right? The first It (2017) was quite scary tbh, but this one simply isn't. On a 'scary rating', I'd give it a 3/10, where as 'Finding Nemo' is 1/10 and 'The Ring' is 9/10.They used a good cast of 'adults' to play the kids from the first movie, although my one critique is that they portrayed 'adult Bev' as a weak-willed woman, where as she was a very strong-willed girl when she was young, so that doesn't make a lot of sense.Anyway... it's an OK movie, but if you're looking for something scary, then rather watch The Ring or It Follows or even Paranormal Activity.",6,1,2,19 November 2019
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," A legendary comedy, Will Ferrell at his best
","Apart from spawning multiple memes over the years, this movie also got quite a few laughs out of me. The comedy isn't what you'd call 'high brow' but that's because it's aimed at the 'immature kid' in all of us, and that's why it makes us laugh. 'Anchorman 2' was a huge disappointment and I wouldn't recommend that you watch that at all.... Just watch the original and appreciate how good it is.",8,0,0,1 May 2020
The Green Mile," A tragic tale, told brilliantly
","It's a sad movie from start to finish, with hardly any redeeming moments in-between. Why didn't they save him? Why did they allow it to happen? Only Stephen King knows. It's a great movie, but a sad one; definitely not a 'feel good' movie at all, even Shawshank Redemption had SOME redeeming moments but The Green Mile is even more of a tale of woe than Shawshank is.",9,0,1,24 September 2019
The Wrestler," Only a 7/10 film, but a 9/10 wrestling biopic
","I don't like fake wrestling, so the movie didn't really appeal to me, but I can recognise good acting when I see it, and Mickey Rourke did some fine acting in this film.There's actually a few documentaries out there that show EXACTLY what they showed in this movie ie. a bunch of washed-up fake wrestlers sitting in an auditorium with their posters/dvds and looking as sad as an old dog in the heavy rain... it's really something that happens.I wouldn't recommend the film to anyone who's looking for a good movie to watch, but I certainly would recommend it to anyone who has even just a passing interest in fake wrestling, since this film would carry a lot more weight for people with that particular interest.7/10 for an overall film, but 9/10 for a wrestling film.",8,0,0,10 February 2020
Prometheus," A great sci-fi movie. Bravo Ridley Scott
","Man oh man... Ridley Scott sure can make some good bloody movies! Gladiator, Hannibal, Matchstick Men, American Gangster... the hits just keep on coming!You don't even need to have watched any of the previous Aliens movies in order to appreciate this movie, but it helps. There's certain scenes where your mouth is agape (those where references to Aliens are discovered), but only if you've watched the previous movies.The movie has very little action, but the action scenes are highly condensed and pretty much the entire final 25% of the movie is action packed. I think that the characters in the movie act irrationally and unrealistically in certain scenes, but it's nothing too gratuitous, or else I would have deducted more stars. I know it's difficult to make the characters in a film make rational and realistic decisions (since then the film would be over a lot quicker), but honestly, often times it's not that difficult at all.Overall it's a good movie, and a very good sci-fi movie. Looking forward to the next one from Ridley.",8,2,5,5 May 2020
Blade Runner," Lacking action, future and pacing
","I watched the 'Final Cut' version of the film which was digitally remastered. The CGI in the 'final cut' version was pretty good, though that came down to only the city-skylines and the flying cars in the end... the movie actually features very little CGI tbh.The entire film's idea of 'It's the future!' was neon signs, people wearing funky clothes, and a few flying car scenes.... that's literally all the stuff in the movie that would give you the idea that this movie is supposed to take place in the future... There weren't any cool 'let's dissect a robot-synth' scenes, which would give the viewer the impression that it really WAS the future that the movie is taking place in.... oh no! Instead we as the viewers are just supposed to accept that it's the future, because the actor is playing a robot-synth... during the whole movie we never see any 'proof' that the actors are actually robot-synths... I mean, take a movie like Terminator 1/2 for instance... Those two movies feature robot-synths and the director of those movies actually takes the time to SHOW YOU that the actor is an actual robot-synth, by having a hand chopped off, or having some exposed wiring in the chest or whatever.... but Bladerunner did none of that...Anyway, that was my biggest gripe about the film... other than that the film has very little action and the pacing of very slow. Can't really recommend that anyone watch it. The Bladerunner movie from 2017 is much much better imo.",5,0,2,5 May 2020
Casino Royale," Plot-holes royale
","Yet another Bond change, and they don't even mention a single thing about the change... not even a 'He's on a permanent vacation' quip or nothing like that... they just completely ignore the fact that they're now calling another person 'James Bond'. I think it's just sloppy writing and laziness that they don't even want to think of an excuse for 'the new guy'.Let's look at the plot-holes: The bulldozer that Bond drives has bulletproof glass... that's not realistic as bulldozers don't have bulletproof glass... so Bond would have taken 3 shots to the face and died right on the spot if this movie was realistic, and this creates a plot-hole.Another plot-hole is where Bond is standing with 4 guys aiming AK47's at his face... and he throws down his gun, draws another gun, aims, shoots a guy, aims, then shoots some gas canisters, all the while the guys with their AK47's DON'T shoot him... this whole sequence of him dropping his gun, aiming twice, shooting twice, takes 2-3seconds... so you're telling me that the reaction time of 4 armed guys is MORE than 2-3seconds? The average human's reaction time is 0.25 seconds, not bloody 2-3seconds! Bond would have been riddled with bullets before he got the second shot off... this creates another plot-hole.Another plot-hole is a scene where Bond chases a petrol-tanker... instead of just shooting the bloody thing and thus exploding it safely with nobody getting hurt, and stopping the threat of it exploding near the intended target, he spends 5 minutes wrestling with the bad-guy for control of the tanker... makes zero sense and is illogical.Yet another plot-hole is the fact that choking someone unconscious does NOT kill them... they regain consciousness within 15seconds or so; you'd have to keep choking them for another 20-30seconds after they passed out, in order to actually kill them... so the choking scene in the movie is completely fake and unrealistic. Also, during that choking scene, the girl just stands there and does bloody nothing... any normal human in that same situation would at least try to assist in some way, but no, she just stands there, and that's another plot-hole.Another plot-hole is where the bad-guys dump the girl's body in the middle of the road, and Bond doesn't see it... yet only a few seconds earlier, they showed Bond being not even 300meters behind them in his car, so it's literally impossible for them to have dumped the girl's body in the middle of the road AND gotten out of sight, without Bond seeing them doing it, since he was only a few seconds behind them in the chase.This could easily have been an 8/10 action movie, if only they took the time to NOT include so many plot-holes. All of the plot-holes are avoidable and it's just through sheer laziness that they've been left in the film. That unfortunately results in a 5/10 film that is unrealistic and not believable.",5,0,8,12 May 2020
Jojo Rabbit," The 'Kiwi Tarantino' does it again
","A good 'comedy' to pass 1hr40mins with.It's a comedy, though it's not 'hilarious' as some are claiming... I laughed once, and giggled maybe twice... so it's definitely NOT 'hilarious'... it's just a nice little comedy, with a good story thrown in (the story, btw, is very reminiscent of Inglourious Basterds).Taika Waititi (the director) is starting to build up a nice resume of movies, and it certainly helps that (so far) 3 of his movie are 8/10 movies in my book, so it's CLEAR that he has talent and he's still got a long career ahead of him... I think of his as the 'Kiwi Tarantino'",8,0,1,24 December 2019
Midway," On-par with 'Pearl Harbor' (2001), which means it's not that great...
","'Pearl Harbor' (2001) was a solid 6/10 movie, and this movie isn't much better... This movie has an absolute TONNE of CGI, and it's the kind of CGI where you can actually see that it's clearly CGI. I actually laughed at the begining of the movie, where they showed a bunch of CGI guys running on the deck of a ship, and I was like 'Humans don't run like that!'. You could SO CLEARLY see that it's CGI, like why didn't they just get a real ship to run on? According to the wikipedia page, they actually did shoot some scenes on a real battleship, so why was it deemed necessary to show fake CGI guys running on a ship? It is confusing and hilarious at the same time.Appart from that, Ed Skrein's fake american accent really made my ears bleed through the entire movie... I don't get why he couldn't just talk normally... I'd rather listen to justin beaver music on loop, than listen to another second of Ed Skrein's fake accent in this movieI liked the fact that they atleast ATTEMPTED to show the battles from the perspective of the Japanese. The scenes are few and far between, but they tried showing a different perspective at least.Overall, the movie has way too much CGI and not enough of the Japanese's perspective, but it's an OK movie if you want to watch a war-film for 2hours. 6.5/10",7,0,2,6 February 2020
Godzilla," A worthy successor to the 1998 movie
","As someone who liked the 1998 Godzilla movie and who has watched it around 5 times, I can honestly say that this 2014 Godzilla movie is a very good sequel (technically it's a reboot, but I still think it's a sequel).The movie places a MUCH smaller emphasis on Godzilla himself and he makes his first appearance 85minutes into the film! That's a stark contrast to the 1998 movie where Godzilla's first appearance was MUCH earlier in the film.The last 30minutes of the movie though is where all the action is at... It features a cool battle between the monsters and eventhough Godzilla takes a lot of unnecessary damage, the battle is still fun and believable.The entire movie is honestly worth a watch. I however would NOT recommend that you watch the 2019 atrocious movie titled 'Godzilla King of Monsters' as that movie is quite horrible. Anyway, this movie get a 7/10 for an overall movie, and 8/10 if you compare it to other monster-movies.",7,1,1,1 May 2020
Looper," A great sci-fi movie
","This movie has an amazing balance of action, story and dialogue. It doesn't spend too much time lingering on either one, and it makes for a fantastic movie.Emily Blunt, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce WIllis all delivered very good performances. The story itself is believable, and isn't too far fetched, as some sci-fi movies sometimes can be.Overall it's a great movie and I would have given it a 9/10 if only it was a bit longer.",8,0,1,2 May 2020
Gangs of New York," 3hrs of brawling greatness
","It's a street-fighting time-piece, and it's amazing. Set in a time when violence, corruption, back-stabbing and lawlessness are the norm... A wet behind the ears boy (DiCaprio) finds himself between the crosshairs of a ruthless kingpin (Daniel Day-Lewis), with a foxy strumpet (Cameron Diaz) thrown right in the middle of it all... it's a recipe for disaster... a beautifully crafted disaster. Another Scorsese masterpiece",9,5,6,27 August 2019
Spectre," Good Bond film
","A couple of times in the movie, guys with guns for some reason rather engage each other in hand-to-hand combat, which makes little sense. There's also some other minor plot-holes and illogical things that happen in the movie, but it's nothing major... certainly it's nothing nearly as bad as the plot-holes in the previous Bond movies, so that's fortunate...That being said however, the actual movie is good... it's not excellent or spectacular... it's just good... solid 7/10",7,0,1,14 May 2020
Warcraft," Not as good as the short-cinematics that Blizzard puts out...
","It's sad that that really any of these cinematics are a better story and more action packed than the Warcraft film... why did they spend 160million USD on a full cast/crew/actors when they could just spend like 10million USD to put the animation team at Blizzard on a FULL TIME cinematic-making schedule? I bet that that team can crank out a 2hr full feature cinematic in a year or so... and it would perform WAY better than the Warcraft film did... 30million views on YT, will probably translate to the same views in the cinema, so that's 300million USD gross easily, from a 10million USD budget... AND it would be better. That being said... the Warcraft film is good, but not great or amazing.",7,0,1,10 September 2019
Alien: Covenant," Not nearly as good as Prometheus
","The characters in this film make SO MANY stupid, irrational and unrealistic decisions that it's not even funny. Sometimes you can excuse things like that, since if every character in every movie acted 'normally and rationally' then all movies would be significantly shorter in length than what they would otherwise have been... but it just happens a lot in this movie and it honestly creates a bunch of plot-holes and contribute to poor writing and a poor plot.I liked Prometheus (I give it an 8/10), but the pacing and story of this movie is just so wrong that it's not enjoyable (apart from the plot-holes in this one).*Spoiler ahead if you haven't watched Prometheus yet:* In Prometheus, at the end, the robot's head is ripped clean off his body, yet in this movie, the one robot gets injured in the neck area, and then he completely shuts down... Now that makes zero sense, since we already know that these robots can survive with JUST their head... so why the robot shutdown if he just received an injury to the neck? That's a pretty big plot-hole in this movie.Overall, this movie could have been very good and maybe even as good as Prometheus, but the idiotic choices made by the characters and the plot-holes, just make this movie bad and not really worth watching even.",6,2,2,5 May 2020
Atonement," A true-to-form adaptation from the book to the big-screen
","At first, I didn't think the movie was deservant of an '8/10' rating, but then, after watching the movie, I descided to read a summary of the novel titeled 'Atonement' by Ian McEwan, and it all made sense. After you realize that the film isn't based on any true fact or any historical event, then you can watch the film in a whole other light.The film isn't a happy film... it's not a 'popcorn & soda' film... it's very much a film that delivers a message about morality, choices and regret. You won't find anything lighthearted in the film.I liked the film very much (as much as you CAN like a drama film), and the portrayal delivered by both McAvoy and Knightley is top-notch. I didn't know what to expect when I first started watching and I didn't even watch the trailer yet, but I can honestly say that I am happy that I watched the film and that I would very much recommend that others watch the film.",8,0,0,4 February 2020
