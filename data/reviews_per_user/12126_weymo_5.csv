Catch Me If You Can," run the gauntlet if you dare!
",If you can make it through this Chinese water torture you can get POW status! This is the slowest movie I think I have ever seen.  (My wife claims that only 'True Stories' by the Talking Heads makes a better sleeping pill.)  It is a good example of how a lot of talented people can get together and in a self-important moment design a mundane period piece that only artsy types would like.  Except this trifle is not even artful.  Part of the problem is the movie claims to be a 'secret agent man'-type thriller...but where you expect a Beatles concert you get 'That Thing You Do.' Tripe.,1,5,20,5 July 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," surprising!
","After thoroughly hating 'Two Weeks Notice' based almost entirely upon the scatalogical 'go ahead...take a crap in the Beemer' scene, I was fully expecting to hate another silly chick flick.  However, my wife and I found this the positive example of quintessential romantic comedy.  The plot is simple and the juxtaposition maybe even a little weary, but the actors bring a great deal to their respective parts.  We both found ourselves laughing out loud over and over again...something that has become quite rare lately with movie rentals. My only complaint is that this movie could easily have been called 'Sex In The City: The Movie' and you can easily hang names on the primary characters. Kate Hudson does a great Bebe Neuwirth in the lead role and Bebe Neuwirth interjects fun.  The DVD offers deleted scenes which only underscore the similarity between the story and 'Sex In The City.'",9,0,1,5 July 2003
The Others," Brilliant & Masterful...
","Blair Witch Project was a Scooby Doo cartoon mystery compared to the suspense and horror that this film evokes.  Despite its PG-13 rating, I would hesitate to allow anyone under 16 to see this film.  It's very unsettling.  But don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic film.  Kidman and the cast demonstrate that it doesn't take gore and chainsaws to create a true horror movie.  This film is intelligent and skillfully filmed.  Every nuance; every scene is perfectly crafted to recreate a mystery.  There is no red herring, yet the complex story keeps you guessing.  I'll have to see the movie again to appreciate how much the storyteller does give away and how obvious the mystery's solution seems in retrospect.  The foggy mists and gray colors and dark corners will haunt you...but you'll savor every minute of it. I love horror movies...but this is a movie I'm glad I waited to see at home. I was glad to be able to put my back against a wall.",10,0,0,18 May 2002
The Butterfly Effect," Masterpiece...
","I've just finished the director's cut and I really enjoyed this very well thought-out plot. As a big fan of sci fi I found myself pleased with the treatment of all of the subject matter. Ashton made the main character believable and keeps you guessing as his mental state changes.  It's hard to know what is real and what is real to him.  I  highly recommend this film for fans of mysteries, time travel, mental health dramas, etc. One word of warning though, if you have issues with children in dire situations, brace yourself. Fantastic.",10,1,2,9 July 2004
The Red Violin," a visceral pleasure
","This is a movie lover's movie.  The perfect characters, sensual landscapes, delicious textures, and altogether mysterious plot.  Although the riddle is not difficult to solve...in fact you may very quickly...the joy is in the getting there.  The story weaves about in time and space, forming a fabric so fine that in the end you have lived a lifetime in the arms of the Red Violin. This is the perfect movie for a rainy autumn Sunday afternoon when everything is quiet but the popping of the fire and the creaking of your favorite easy chair.",10,0,0,18 September 2001
