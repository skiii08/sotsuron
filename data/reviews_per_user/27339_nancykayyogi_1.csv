The Finest Hours," I was pretty bored, nice ending though
","I found it hard to connect to the characters on any kind of emotional level. This made the overall experience pretty boring because I just couldn't get into this movie. It didn't grab me. There were moments toward the end that started to grab me and the ending was sweet. I just feel it could have been done in a much more powerful way. In all fairness I was a little late getting to the movie theater so I missed the first bits, so maybe I missed some of the initial character building and bonding, which may have engaged me more. I also got basically strip searched by the theater when entering the film so I was a little annoyed and on edge about that. So maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought it was. Who knows. I know its a true story, so I probably shouldn't judge it by the plot. The action sequences in the waves were certainly riveting, although not very believable. It felt a little disjointed the way they told the two stories simultaneously. I suspect this movie would be received best by military or marine-going families.",5,4,13,9 March 2016
