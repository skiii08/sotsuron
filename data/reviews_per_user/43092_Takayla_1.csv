The Blair Witch Project," Wow - That About Sums It Up..
","This movie was incredibly real and incredibly scary.  The concept is great, however, I think that big kudos should go to the actors, Heather, Josh and Mike.  It was Heather's realistic, blood curdling screams and incredibly true to life hysterics that made me want to sit closer to the person next to me.  It was a terrifically scary movie and I can't wait to see it again.",10,1,2,30 May 1999
