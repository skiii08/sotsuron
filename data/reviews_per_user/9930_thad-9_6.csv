Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Re-inventing the wheel, and it actually works!
","If you walk into Episode One expecting a Star Wars film that is similar to the old ones, your opinion will change quickly.  In Star Wars Episode One, director George Lucas has created an all new vision for an all new trilogy set long before the original Star Wars film, Episode Four.  Stunning visuals, a compelling plot, quirky and funny characters, and one of the coolest villians ever welcome audiences into a truly original film experience.  We will all be watching this film with great interest, eh Senator Palpatine.",10,0,1,19 May 1999

The Matrix Revolutions," Simply amazing
","This film was a truly worthy conclusion to one of the greatest series of all time. Not all people will understand nor appreciate this film and this series, but it truly does ascribe to something higher than merely setting a standard for special effects; it sets  standard for telling the hero's story. It sets a standard for how we can understand humanity's capabilities: the capability for love and peace. Just amazing.",10,0,0,6 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Better make the T4 sequel...
","because this film left me wanting much more. Definately was a fun movie to watch, but it screams for a sequel! Arnold is finally back with a good film, and the great egoist James Cameron may finally realize that other people can make good with his old ideas. Hopefully this film and the positive reaction will cause Cameron to actually start making quality movies again along the lines of Aliens, T1 and T2 and True Lies.",10,0,0,1 July 2003
Mission: Impossible II," Ssssslllooowwww mmoootiioonn crraappyyy mooooovvviieeeeeeee
","This movie, if all of the slow motion were played in real time, would have been only 45 minutes long. That would have been much better than the 2 hour piece of crap us movie goers have to suffer.  I wanted to leave, but my girlfriend wouldn't let me.  She said something about loving Cruise's hair. Good god, this mission should have been aborted.",10,1,1,26 May 2000
Gladiator," Incredible
","I was lucky enough to catch the Dreamworks press screening for this movie and I must say this is the best film I have seen since Braveheart.  Better action sequences, better fights, and pure testosterone action with oscar calibre dialogue.  This is truly the first must see movie in years that not only lives up to the hype, but moves beyond it.  Russel Crowe is now an official star.",10,1,2,26 April 2000
