The Blair Witch Project," Best horror film of the decade
","The camera work gives a wonderful air of credibility to the film, and (because of the way the movie was filmed) the actors are amazingly authentic.  Perhaps the best part about this movie was the way it stays in your head afterwards; being outside after dark will never be the same.  It's also great to see a horror film that doesn't contain gallons and gallons of fake blood and computer-generated monsters that are shown from the outset of the movie - many recent 'horror' movies could take a great lesson from this one.  I would recommend this film to anyone who's looking for a TRUE scary flick.",8,1,3,23 August 1999
Remember the Titans," Wonderful!
","Definitely one of the best movies around.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and am extremely excited that I can recommend it to anyone since the film is very family-friendly.  My most common complaint of today's movies is the predictability factor that runs rampant.  Even though this movie was predictable, it didn't matter when you consider that the main facts of the movie are true: A young black coach takes over, a team has to get past its bigotry to play together, and some amazing things happen.  Perhaps creative license was exercised, but I'd like to believe that most of what was portrayed was 100% accurate.If you have the opportunity to watch the DVD, please check out the extras - very cool behind-the-scenes documentaries, and some interesting facts about the movie as well (like the minimal budget it was made on...).  Highly recommended to every person who enjoys quality entertainment (particularly without swearing, sex, and bloody violence).10 stars out of 10!",10,0,0,16 July 2001
