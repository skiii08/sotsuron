Requiem for a Dream," Party Scene
","About the party scene. The cast directory lists four woman as party girls, Heather Litteer, Ami Goodheart, Nina Zaverin and Jenny Decker. After viewing the movie I only noticed three different woman, if the fourth woman in the party scene is supposed to be Marion. i.e Jennifer Connelly then in the uncut version the shot from above showing two woman, I would assume be the forth actress in the directory and that she would act as Jennifer's body double (no pun intended)? or did Jen do this scene? I would be interested to know. Anyone have any thoughts?",Null,0,0,14 August 2001
