Mission: Impossible III," Not Quite Impossible; But Very Unoriginal
","IMF (Impossible Missions Force) Secret Agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) more or less considers himself retired from active duty the day he committed to a serious relationship with Julia, the woman he truly loves. But he is drawn to a mission that involves the kidnapping of an operative which is not only a dear friend to him but is also Ethan's pupil. As this mission becomes too complicated that it becomes a personal vendetta for Ethan, he meets Owen Davian, a vicious black-market lord whose power and influence makes him impregnable to be caught by the many of the world's intelligence agencies. Davian eventually finds out Ethan Hunt's weak spot, which is the woman he loves. And uses her to make Ethan do his bidding.The storyline dwells outside the typical 'mission' storyline and gives us a spotlight on what happens if a secret agent's personal security is compromised when his enemies get to the agent's family or loved ones. Mission: Impossible 3 just has a storyline that may rival the finest Steven Seagal movie. With a storyline that has been overdone in Hollywood movies and executed without a shred of originality, this movie is just good if you're in the mood for eye candy action. A dumbed-down spy movie with a silly plot line but entertaining action. This movie just looks like Cruise's own version of James Bond. On the other hand, MI2 and MI3 may not have been awful as James Bond movies.Although that I'm sure that this movie will indeed satisfy those who crave for hot spy action, and will indeed draw up mass numbers in the box office, I really would not share the same excitement that favors this movie. But what many would find unusually startling is that there are a number of us who dislike these Mission: Impossible movies because these movies have been committing grave acts of sacrilege upon what is already considered a respected Espionage-thriller series. Let me give you a comparison. What if Harry Potter was filmed in teen flick format not found in the books, but just improvised just to draw up numbers in the box-office? What if the Da Vinci Code was made into a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced action flick starring Ben Affleck with explosive action sequences not found in the book, but improvised to make it more explosive action appealing'? Wouldn't that draw up a bad reaction from the fans of the source material? It is the same case with Mission: Impossible, a TV series about a secret agent team which goes into impossible espionage missions, yet they fulfill it unscathed by detection, so much so that by the end of the episode when the bad guys are defeated, they have no idea that they were duped by manipulative spies of the Impossible Missions Force. Whilst in the movie, the main character leaves a trail of explosions. This is a clear example of Hollywood ruining the classics; forever tarnishing the good name for which such stood for (same with Planet of the Apes and how Tim Burton's remake ruined it) The script is written by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and director JJ Abrams. JJ Abram's directing is well-executed. But I'm sure he can build up a better reputation with another project worth his talent. On the other hand, Abrams is already enjoying a phenomenal reputation having created the hit TV series' 'Alias', 'Lost' and 'Felicity'.Just like MI2, there is an unusual sense of narcissistic spotlight that surrounds actor-producer Tom Cruise's character. It was as if the entire script was written around him. They should've entitled MI2 and this movie 'The Ethan Hunt Adventures'. He's the producer who pays for the entire movie anyway. The characters of Ving Rhames, Billy Crudup, and the lusciously alluring Maggie Q all take a back seat as script wallflowers playing off the main character. There was even a one minute spotlight on Maggie Q's character which was awkwardly not followed-up by the progression of the storyline. Tom Cruise is not a bad actor. It was refreshing to see Cruise as a villain in Collateral. But for him to go back and do the same old protagonistic action hero role, in which he has done for almost 10 years has taken its toll. Not unless it is a movie with an exceptionally good storyline. But with a mediocre storyline and a role that we have already seen in many guises and in many Cruise interpretations, he really could not expect praise for his monotonous role in this movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman, is another story, though. Because Hoffman has delivered a truly-salute-deserving diabolical villain performance in this movie. Being the redeeming factor of the film, Hoffman has created this kind of fan-inducing villain, which may remind us of the charisma of Star War's Darth Vader.Sure it's flashy, loud, and explosive. But aside from that, it is nothing special from your average mediocre big summer action flick. Sadly, the thrills, intrigue, and storyline are a pale comparison to one of the episodes of the Mission: Impossible TV series. The good news is that this movie is clearly a notch above amusing. And indeed it is a movie made for the mass crowds who like their popcorn action with a whole lot of explosions, gunfight, and cheesy stunts.",Null,7,18,3 May 2006
Iron Man 2," Energetically Spectacular
","I thoroughly enjoyed IRON MAN 2. But there are some very minor stuff that sort of bothered me. First off, I did like the character played by Mickey Rourke, which is Ivan Vanko (which seems to be a combination of the comic book characters Whiplash & Crimson Dynamo). But I felt that the details of the character were too underdeveloped. We got to see his some of his quirks and a little bit of back story which we thought was going to be spotlighted later on in the movie. Only to realize that the back story which felt like a teaser was not fully satisfied in the end anyway, and we walk off the movie not really having a full grasp what his character was all about. If the story wanted him to be a mysterious 'force of nature' villain, the film should not have heavily teased on a back story in the first place, and should have gone with the fully mysterious psycho all the way. Basically his character was out to have vengeance on Stark, accusing his family of stealing an idea his (Vanko's) father pioneered. But in the end, it really was not clear what that 'stealing of idea' was all about, or how Vanko's father was allegedly betrayed by the Stark family.You cannot dismiss the movie as just a superhero movie because like any good superhero movie, the story focuses on the story's characters rather than on just the superhero. The film does not solely rely on action, but much on humor. There were moments in the middle of the movie that made me forget I was watching a superhero movie, or an action movie. Much of the movie centers its focus on Tony Stark's relationship with his friend Rhodes, his assistant Pepper Potts, and his rival Justin Hammer. The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow is very sparklingly attractive and fun to watch.Don Cheadle was fine as Rhodes, Tony Stark's friend. But the fact that he is not physically consistent with Terence Howard, the actor he replaced for the role, messes up what should have been a fluid consistency with the previous Iron Man movie. In the end you forget about it (and he is, in comparison, as good as a replacement as Maggie Gyllenhal was in replacing Katie Holmes in the Dark Knight movie).Robert Downey Jr. is magnificent in his role. His Tony Stark is like the new role model; girls throw themselves at him & guys wanna be like him. His humor is always on the spot and his charms are flawless. His screen presence and how he makes a scene come alive is the major battery that makes this an enjoyable film.And then there's Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury. Which reminds me of the other nitpick detail that hated about the movie, and that is Nick Fury's first appearance in the movie. For a character which is supposed to have some degree of importance, his first scene looked like it lacked impact. Fury, appearing and having a conversation with Stark, in morning daylight, while wearing that shiny coat, made him look like a joke. And then we see the first costume appearance of Black Widow in the same scene, which also made her appearance have no impact at all. In fact, it was a scene that awkwardly made Nick Fury and Black Widow look silly and indeed looked like two people wearing costumes for some Halloween party. Even though the first line of Fury was indeed very funny, I still stand by the opinion that it was one scene that was just poorly conceptualized.Comedian Garry Shandling also appears in the movie, and although his role is not a major one, I consider him to be a highlight of the movie. He plays a Senator who is very skeptical and critical of Tony Stark and seems to have a shady background. His role was deadpan serious and almost villainous that he instantly feels like an un-ignorable beloved 'other villain'. From the moment he appears you can tell that he's supposed to be a big A-hole, and he does a great job with it.Jon Favreau who is both a great actor, comedian, and is also the director of the movie did a great job in making this sequel spectacular and continuously fun to watch. Despite its flaws, the movie was very enjoyable. It was well-paced, and designed never to bore its audience. The dialogues are very witty. And its performers do a marvelous job with their lines. It also had interesting non-clich√© comedy gold moments. One of the funniest scenes that I enjoyed involve Robert Downey Jr. and one of those office decorations (you will know by the time you watch the movie). Although I felt that there would have been many interesting stunts or refreshingly new action tricks that can be made with the new villains (especially one with a super-powered whip), I cannot disregard the fact that the film invested more on the storyline aspect so to not make this movie just a mere 'dumb action flick' that wants to appeal to all audience demographics.All in all, IRON MAN 2 is a High Matin√©e movie. Although greatly flawed, these flaws are only noticeable from a critical point of view. Even I came out of it with a full-bar fun movie experience, and only realizing its flaws hours later. If you love a movie with witty characters and some cool heavy metal robot action, then this movie is definitely for you. And let me remind you that there is an additional scene after the end credits, so if you don't wanna miss it then you might wanna stay awhile for it.",8,5,16,30 April 2010
World War Z," Simple Yet Very Kinetic
","Simple and typical may be what I may describe this movie. World War Z is good enough not to fall on the classification of lousy or awful. At least it does not drag; the movie is engaging and never ever slows down to cause the slightest bit of boredom. At best, it feels like what I imagine would be a perfectly well-made zombie video game adaptation. I'm sure that the movie has some intellectual or subliminal message hidden in and around the movie, or whatever message the writers want to convey. Whatever it may be, we could not really notice that since the pace of the film is fast and hyperactive. But at least it's never chaotic and messy.On the horror aspect, it effectively does generate some screams and shouts. The scares are moderately efficient, and the zombies do indeed manage to be horrifying, even though they did not need to be extra disgusting and/or gory.Although this may be considered as a zombie movie, it never crosses beyond its PG-13 rating. Meaning, it does not have the usual gore and violence other zombies have. Whatever violence the movie has is never focused or highlighted. It's a horror movie that may be considered 'pretty safe' for a younger audience.The problem with World War Z is that it's blown its wad by showing some of the best money shots of the movie on its trailer. The flooding stampede of zombies is the film's most impressive and unique eye candy. We've already seen fast zombies, we've also already seen extra-strong zombies (in 'I Am Legend' they're not exactly zombies, but they have similarities with the zombies in this movie), but we've never seen them like this, the way World War Z presents them. On one point of view, it's refreshingly unique, on another point of view; it's a childish, over-bloated exaggeration of the concept.But the flooding, stampeding zombies; that's the movie's one ace card. Aside from that, the movie is pretty simple horror suspense. What happens in the end is not your typical summer blockbuster climax scene; there's nothing extraordinary, like a big boss fight of some kind. With the way it was executed in the end, it felt like an indie horror movie.But just because it has a quiet ending, it does not mean that it was a bad movie. The ending is consistent and fluid. It's not something impossible, incredible, explosive, or cartoonish. It's simple, and it makes sense that way in a manner consistent with the movie's tone. Overall, World War Z is a moderately good zombie movie; entertaining enough to be worth your money and time. But you will not be missing out on anything if you happen to skip it.",6,44,90,19 June 2013
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Starting Out Summer With Such A Delightfully Sizzling Meltdown
","Just in time for the end of the classes, ICE AGE 2: THE MELTDOWN starts out the summer season with such a sizzling meltdown of fun and laughter.In this sequel of the highly successful and enjoyable animated comedy 'ICE AGE', Manny the woolly mammoth, Sid the Sloth, and Diego the Saber-tooth Tiger, along with Scrat the Rodent are back, continuing their adventurous life during the Earth's Ice Age. But this time, their little peace is alarmed when they found out that there is a big meltdown that is about to happen and that it may cause a catastrophic flood that can wipe them off the face of the Earth. In their journey to seek escape and survival, they meet Ellie, a female woolly mammoth who thinks she's a possum, along with her two 'brothers' Crash and Eddie, pesky little possums whose impish energy seems to energize the herd of characters in this movie.A number of big shot celebrities lent their voices in this movie. Of course, Ray Romano as Manny, John Leguizamo as Sid, and Dennis Leary as Diego all returned to play their respective roles from the last movie. They are joined by Queen Latifah who voiced the character of Ellie, and Seann William Scott and Josh Peck as possums Crash and Eddie. In addition, comedian Will Arnett and late night talk show celebrity Jay Leno also lent their voices to supporting characters. The film is directed by Carlos Saldanha whose credits include animated features 'Robots' and the first 'Ice Age' movie.I was surprised to see the theater packed with kids and families on a Wednesday evening screening. Then I realized that classes have already ended by this week and it sure is in synch with the opening of this family-friendly film. If one could feel the vibe of a wholesome crowd ready for some Ice Age fun on a Wednesday evening, I could imagine how much more on a weekend.But to those whose funny bones are hard to reach, this sequel may not be as rib-tickling as the first one, but as much as Ice Age 2 may just be a clich√©d-up chip off the old movie it sure is, at least, gives some satisfaction and a loud laugh off the film's target audience: the families. The theater where I watched this movie in would light up in the loud laughter of kids and parents alike. In addition, the storyline of the sequel seems inevitably important as a continuation of the first movie; just as the first movie tells of the coming of the Ice Age, the sequel tells its end, that is, when a meltdown occurs and the Earth is restored to its normal global climate. But as strict followers of science might argue that the actual Ice Age lasted for around more than a hundred years, what may be referred in the movie is what is known as an interglacial warming period.As far as the character of the rodent Scrat would go, there's a whole lot of funnier antics, as this 'posterboy' (or 'poster-rat' as it may seem) of the Ice Age movie is still relentlessly pursuing that acorn that just always seems to slip off his grasp. The animation detail in this movie gets a step ahead with animated visuals like water, which is one thing that stands as a challenge to many animated projects. Many of the scenes that involve water and floods are spectacularly realistic to watch, as well as the fur in the woolly mammoths that also look amazingly realistic. The team of animators, along with Blue Sky Studios, the home of 'Ice Age,' 'Robots,' the Oscar-winning short 'Bunny,' have done a great job with Ice Age 2. The music and sound effects were also buzzing with delightful energy. There is even a musical number with singing vultures that really knocked me out with laughter.ICE AGE 2: THE MELTDOWN is enjoyable and hilarious. A real family treat just in time for the end of the school year and the opening of the summer vacation season. Definitely for kids of all ages.",6,15,31,29 March 2006
Shrek Forever After," Shrek 4: A Flawed Comedy but a Perfect Final Chapter
","When I found out that a fourth Shrek movie was being made, it made me frown because it seemed pretty needless, especially that the last movie was such a bore. But then again, if you take the storyline into consideration, this becomes a fitting final chapter to formally close the Shrek series. The movie is originally entitled SHREK FOREVER AFTER, but in other regions of the world including ours, it is entitled SHREK: THE FINAL CHAPTER, so it's obvious.First we go to the more unpleasant aspects; this movie works more as a fantasy-adventure movie rather than a comedy. That's because the humor factor of Shrek has gone old already. This movie seems to squeeze the very last drop of what is left of the Shrek series' dried out desert of humor. Sure, it may make us give out a chuckle here, a chuckle there, but this Shrek movie cannot make us laugh out loud anymore. When you look back at its title 'Shrek the Final Chapter' you would realize that this movie does seem to apologize with the fact that this'll be the last and probably an admission that they could not squeeze any more decent thing out of the Shrek saga after this one; it's a final effort to make one last buck.On the other hand, Shrek's main story aspect is a little more interesting than its humor. As I said earlier, this movie is better as a fantasy adventure because we do get to see an alternate reality where Shrek is back into being an outcast Ogre and everybody else who was originally part of his circle of friends has not met him yet. Eventually, they get into an adventure wherein he must face a new enemy, a new problem, and he even gets to meet other ogres and an ogre resistance army that pretty much reminded me of Warcraft (the old-school Warcraft 2 to be exact). In this bizarro world, Donkey has not met him, Puss has become obese, and Fiona is the leader of the Ogre resistance. Shrek must go through this alternate universe and survive it before the day passes and a curse will consume him for good. Shrek gets to have some action with a horde of witches and must face the dragon once again. I could not say that the action was impressive but it has its little cool moments. I particularly loved the chain skull weapons that the witches use.In addition, this movie works also as a family domestic drama where it maturely deals with the simple family issue of boredom and being sick of how repetitious family life can be. I daresay that the film can work as a satire or perhaps a metaphor that some married men can learn from. There is one sequence in the movie that does capture this crisis; I am talking about the scenes where we see Shrek realize that despite the fact that he does live a happy life, it can get pretty dull and annoying at times, but then again that's life.Perhaps it becomes boring because many of us choose not to grow up; many of us choose to not let go of what our past lives were. That is what happens to Shrek in this movie. To escape the mediocrity of a family life, he wishes to relive the moments when he was still just a normal ogre again. And because of this, he puts his family life in jeopardy. Shrek 4's tale comes full circle in the sense that it questions if Shrek did have a 'happily ever after' ending in the past three movies, and puts one last fantastic circumstance to let him live out a reality that this never happened.And lastly, Shrek 4's main potential lies in its romance. With an alternate reality story, Shrek faces a Fiona that has never met him. Therefore, Shrek must find out some way to make Fiona fall in love with him all over again. If you ask me, the romantic aspect of this movie is as innovative as the first Shrek movie, in ways that it tells mature subject matter in the guise of fantasy. The Fiona of the alternate reality mirrors the plight of women who gave up on romance, and one scene certainly negates the falsity of most fairy tales with a line that goes something like: 'a mere kiss does not solve everything' It negates other fantasies like 'Sleeping Beauty' or 'Snow White' because it destroys the superficial aspect of those obsolete fairy tales with a more realistic approach, because indeed, a kiss is nothing if there is no true love that goes with it. In my opinion, Shrek 4 succeeds in this aspect.Shrek may not be the best movie this summer, or it might not be the funniest Shrek movie, but it certainly is one that is very rich story-wise. Just as his line in the first movie went 'I have layers' and there certainly are deeper layers to this story rather than one that will just make you laugh. Of course, this works out as a great family movie, but it is certainly perfect for couples, most especially married couples, and parents alike. I give SHREK FOREVER AFTER a.k.a. SHREK: THE FINAL CHAPTER a Matin√©e rating for single serving; and a Full Price rating for family servings.",7,83,124,20 May 2010
2012," 2012 & the Not Too Serious Apocalypse?
","Most of Roland Emmerich's movies have been mostly reminiscent of the 70's disaster movies like The Towering Inferno or Poseidon Adventure. These disaster movies are essentially survival horror, wherein we are introduced to main characters that we are supposed to root for and follow as they try to survive a peril or perils that could kill them. This movie more or less combines all of it for something which can be referred to as the ultimate disaster movie because this one deals with the end of the world. As what the movie portrays, 2012 is the year wherein changes in the Earth and in the overall atmosphere of the planet (that's as far as I can understand about the scientific aspect of the movie) will cause the Earth to experience global cataclysms and destruction, and basically may be interpreted as the end of the world as we know it.The doomsday theory of 2012 is one that is very paranoia inducing. Unlike the doomsday conspiracies of the year 2000 or previous end-of-the-world theories which were more religion-based or literary prediction-based, the 2012 concept is based on the Mayan calendar which is regarded with some degree of accuracy. That is why it is very interesting to watch a movie like this. On the other hand, do not expect to go into details on the Mayan calendar detail because there is only about half a minute of reference of that concept in the movie. Everything that is explained is more on the science aspect. In addition, the science aspect is laid down, but never dwells on the explanations. If you plan to walk on this movie and expect to delve into the deeper and more thought-provoking issues about why the world is about to end or how this prediction has come to become real, you may not be satisfied because it really focuses more on the plight of our main characters to survive the cataclysms. Most of the movie is focused on running from earthquakes, running from lava, running from flood. Even the drama takes a backseat.The movie felt like it needed a couple of more minutes of character development. There are pretty good characters here to work with. The old friends in the cruise ship, for instance, the movie needed more quiet moments with them. Every time the scenes simmer down, and you think there was going to be some character development about to happen, a great big special effect all of a sudden steals the moment and makes way for another destructive scene.It was not easy to walk into another Roland Emmerich movie, after his previous movie '10,000 BC' (pattern-wise is also a movie title referring to a date in time, one that he ignorantly altered by his fictionalized interpretation) made itself as one of the worst movies ever made, in my opinion. But it was a good thing that 2012 was not as bad as I feared it to be. In fact, it was really worth my money, and if I may add, a movie I recommend for the big screen. The visual effects are awesome and the stunts were exhilarating.The thing about this movie is that it takes this serious plausible concept and quickly turns it into a roller-coaster adventure. And that is one of the things that have given me this dual reaction; first I was upset with it because it takes this concept of paranoia and a plausible global cataclysm, and does not treat it with a very serious approach. It was a bit hard to swallow some action scenes which injected some humor because at one hand we are being shown scenes of extreme disaster and calamity, naturally the scene implies the horrific death of millions, yet elements of comedy are making its way unto it. If this was sci-fi involving alien invasions, it would have been forgivable to mix apocalyptic scenes of mass death with a sense of adventure.But on the other hand, by the middle of the movie, you realize that the light, somewhat comedic, moments were needed to be injected to please a wide audience. Otherwise, we could have ended up with a movie too serious and too depressing that, by the middle of the movie, may have caused people to walk out in just sheer displeasure.If you are one of those people who even remotely considers the 2012 doomsday conspiracy as plausible, this movie is indeed for you. It will both amaze and horrify you. Although it is indeed so ironic to refer to Emmerich's movies as a form of entertainment. I guess many of us Filipinos will be affected by this movie emotionally because of our experiences in recent unusual cataclysms. Many might hate it or many might relate to it.The concept of the end of the world is the ultimate horror movie concept to work on. Emmerich could have made the ultimate horror movie. I would have been impressed if such bold approach was made. But I could understand him not doing that and opting to make an audience-friendly movie instead. I just hope that this movie would have something similar with his other movie '10,000 B.C.' ¬Öand that is hoping that this will purely be all fiction.",6,1,6,13 November 2009
Ghost Rider," Better LOWER Those Expectations
","GHOST RIDER is an adaptation of the Marvel comics series of the same title. Since I grew up with comic books, I am a big fan of comic book movies. And of course, I was excited to see the GHOST RIDER movie adaptation. Sure, I lowered down my expectations because the storyline of 'Ghost Rider' has been used and overused in numerous films with vaguely similar story lines. I expected for it to be a movie loved with the highest tolerance to criticism. But a disappointing film is a disappointing film. And if it has too little redeeming factors, then there's no reason not to talk about it.Don't get me wrong, GHOST RIDER would not necessarily make you feel like you're throwing away your money on crap. GHOST RIDER has its moments of utter coolness. The fiery transformations with Gothic angelic chorals on the background, the bits of humor, that hellishly radical bike he rides. I would not have even cared if the storyline would be considered over-used & clich√©, because I already did expect that. But just the overall delivery of the movie itself was purely bland. The movie was fun but disappointing.It's no surprise, this film was directed by Mark Steven Johnson, the same guy who directed the Daredevil movie, which also could be considered a failure. well, I guess that's STRIKE TWO! & I don't want to see him directing a superhero/comicbook adaptation movie again. I can appreciate Daredevil with the highest tolerance, and would admit to liking it a little. But it still goes out the same that it was crap, & badly needed to fall on a new director.There was no question of the choices for Nicholas Cage to be Johnny Blaze, Peter Fonda to be Mephistopheles, and Eva Mendes to be Roxanne Simpson. They are all superior performers, and very fitting for their roles at that. But the script never seemed to work well with the direction of the film. Many of the lines looked cheesy, mostly due to the editing which had bad timing and monotony of angles, so much so that Nicholas Cage's supposedly memorable lines end up looking like scenes from a bad B-movie. Same with Peter Fonda, who by the scarcity of film projects made him look like a struggling has-been in this movie. There were moments when Eva Mendes was comedically adorable. But her charm (that usually leaves me lovesick) could not save her from ending up looking like a cheap 'face' in a sad project. At least Wes Bentley was spunky for the role. But his entire look for the film did not carry on a sense of overwhelmingly cool villain. His costume looked like he was spoofing each and every clich√© from each and every badly-made superhero and vampire movie. His hair & make-up looked more metrosexual than demon, he could not intimidate me and I swear I could easily ward him off with smelly feet and a bad fashion sense.The fight scenes were pathetic. Sure, the 'minion' villains known as The Hidden were cool. But the fighting scenes with them did not excite me. In action movies, nothing's new these days when it comes to fight scenes. But one should at least make it either interesting or at least sensible for the audiences to get a sense of response. Many of the fight scenes in this movie makes you end up mumbling 'Huh?' or 'What?!' It's as if some characters were too dumb to stand and wait for a punch to hit them. Giving it credit, the film does make the effort to breakthrough with some kind of originality (with scenes like how he beat his enemy made out of the wind), the problem is, they don't really convince me, as far as I'm concerned anyway.CGI or Computer animation is this movie's main Ace card. The thing which it heavily relies to. But one should not really be strict in CGI judgment because in the long run, this technology will get old. It is actually how a film uses its technology to create a good movie. Ghost Rider may have fabulous CGI, but there isn't too much innovative and impressive scenes for it to be a step ahead of the usual eye candy.I cannot deny that there were moments when this movie made me laugh and cheer. But overall, it was a failure, that will stand aside other disappointing classics such as Blade Trinity, Daredevil, and a bit better than that awful Spawn movie adaptation. Oh well, I hope a sequel with a new director could redeem it.",3,2,8,15 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," An X-tremely Magnificent Instant Classic
","This is the final installment to what is now known as the X-MEN Trilogy. Known as the 'Children of the Atom' and the children of human evolution, MUTANTS have become widespread throughout the globe. But a 'cure' for being a mutant was unveiled and this puts into motion the war between the radical mutants who seek to overthrow mankind which has shown mutant community the extent of human prejudice, and the X-men, a mutant group who would stand to defend humanity from mutants who would use their powers to threaten the rest of the defenseless human society.When the comics series 'X-men' was first conceived back in the 1960's by Marvel comics' father, living legend, Stan Lee (which makes an appearance in this film), it was to become one of the most profound comic book sagas, that which is way ahead of its time. Mutants have become a metaphor for the kinds of people who have become victims of prejudice, alienation, and fear. May it be because of race, culture, sex, appearance, religion, or even physical characteristics, whether that characteristic may be a deformity or not. Mutants are feared for what they can do, alienated for what they appear to be, and hated simply for what they are. Not only that; in the U.S., the term 'Mutant' has been a slang term used to defame and demean those who are different and those who don't fit in with the rest of society.Right now, we live in a world wherein equality must prevail, even though factors like terrorist paranoia and biological threats continues to exist, there must be an undying movement for equality. With the cultural and technological advancements of the new millennium making the world smaller for us all, equality and tolerance must exist, because division and inequality might threaten to destroy us all.One of this film's subplots involves a 'cure' for being a mutant. In one way or another, the storyline subliminally raises the question; 'Would you resort to change or alter yourself just to fit in to the rest of society, assuming that your uniqueness is never really a deformity or an abnormality?' Metaphorically, it could be like asking questions such as 'If given a chance, would an Asian try to alter his looks just to look Caucasian or maybe less ethnic? If given a chance, would a homosexual alter his/her sexuality just for the sake of fitting in?' More or less, it could even make us think of our opinions on plastic surgery or playing god with the advances of technology? The film subliminally opens your mind up from the metaphors and to relevant social issues.After the ending of the trilogy's second episode, entitled 'X-2: X-Men United', it is inevitable and understandable to those familiar with the X-men series that what will happen next is what is known as the 'Phoenix saga' which is the storyline wherein Jean Grey is resurrected into the twisted character known as The Dark Phoenix. But it is quite obvious, from the trailers and the publicity of the film, that the main villain in the third installment of the trilogy still is Magneto, and that this third will obviously become the grand finale of Magneto's great war that he wishes to rage and has been talking about ever since the first film. And that the Dark Phoenix storyline is smartly blended along with the Magneto storyline, among other subplots yet to be revealed. But understandably, the film is designed to be a blockbuster big-explosion/big-stunts action bonanza, so understandably, the stunts, the actions, and the special effects would take the front seat in making this film a classic.Looking back months ago, it was hard to imagine a director like Brett Ratner, whose credits include the mediocre 'Red Dragon' and the popcorn flicks 'Rush Hour' 1 & 2, to take on what was Bryan Singer's job of breathing life into what is the greatest superhero team saga in comics' history. Thankfully, for all of us, this third X-men movie stays true to the mood, tone, and overall continuity and consistency with the first two films. With the last X-men movie etching itself to be one of the best superhero movies of all time, this sequel never lets down to shine much more and manages to rise into a new level of cinematic high.However, in one way or another, the film may tend to rely on the idea that the viewer has either watched the two other X-men films, and/or is also familiar with the entire X-men mythos; From the characters, to their powers, to their capabilities and convictions. Not unless you are familiar with such information, you should open your ears and hear out each and every important detail of the storyline.The film's superpower action is very inventive, never redundant and is way ahead of falling off the clich√© hook. Its script and storyline stretches itself far from being predictable. You may consider yourself familiar with the numerous popular X-men story lines, but even that will still less likely exempt you from the film's jaw-dropping surprises; moments in this film which, I'm sure that you will agree with me when I say, that it happens more than once. In addition, I would advice for you not to leave the theater after the end credits because there is a bonus extra scene. A perfectly satisfying epilogue for this final chapter.X-MEN: The Last Stand is this summer's juggernaut blockbuster sci-fi-action-adventure megamovie! A never miss! It is a comic nerd's wet-dream come true! A definite superhero saga movie to end all superhero sagas. Up to this date, the Holy Grail of superhero team movies; An X-traordinarily Superior X-perience! X-citingly X-terminating all X-pectations! This is X-MEN: THE LAST STAND",9,18,46,24 May 2006
The Happening," Enigmatic Terror
","After 'Lady in the Water' has disappointed critics and audiences alike, M. Night Shyamalan rebounds and reclaims his dignity as a filmmaker with 'The Happening'. I really do not like talking much about a good Shyamalan movie because the power of his movies usually come from the revealing surprises it gives audiences; his movies tend to scare you with something you cannot immediately understand. And Shyamalan is the master of mysterious threats, which is quite clear with this movie. All you need to know is that there is an unexplained phenomenon that is inexplicably exterminating human beings in and around the North American region.This movie is such an enigmatic horror movie that reminds me of Radiohead's music video for 'Just' and also mirrors classic horror flicks of the 60's, specifically much like Alfred Hitchcock's many works, it also has that Stephen King feel to it. Shyamalan has gone back what he is good at; tapping at the power of fear. And fear is what you get, as The Happening creates a realistic state of imminent threat creating a paranoia that easily infects the audience. The film actually belongs to the Twilight Zone sort of sci-fi suspense; it is freaky and frighteningly mysterious, injected with a B-movie appeal but with a strong sense of realism.The music was also an excellent mood-setter that appropriately enhances its very unsettling setting. The cast gave a convincing performance, with Mark Wahlberg, and the very charming Zooey Deschanel on the lead; they are supported by explosive performances by John Leguizamo, Ashlyn Sanchez, and a very disturbing role played by Betty Buckley. Shyamalan's direction of making the movie simplistic, non-flashy, and just lets its realistic storyline simply unfold without any unnecessary visual gimmicks. The story simply doesn't even attempt to make a detailed accurate scientific explanation, because the main character in this sort of movie is the fear, not the science. The fear feels real up to the point that I feel like I couldn't just wait till the main characters overcome this threat they're facing.Maybe it was just because I expected so little, but The Happening really took me by surprise, and if you ask me, this movie was way scarier than Sixth Sense. If you want a really good scare or a really good scream, and get to learn a little something as well, THE HAPPENING is something you should watch.",6,72,149,12 June 2008
Casino Royale," The BEST Bond Movie in Years
","CASINO ROYALE is set in the early days of James Bond, so we won't be seeing a hundred percent the James Bond we already know. Instead, we are being treated into HOW he becomes the man that we know he is. This progression is excellently done. A very smart way of portraying subtle changes in Bond's psyche, and such a storyline that does answer many James Bond questions that many have long asked.Martin Campbell is a sure and safe bet to creating and re-introducing this new world of James Bond. After all, he was the one who pulled off giving the Pierce Brosnan Bond a grand welcome introduction with 'GoldenEye'. His sense of tight consistency and balance gives CASINO ROYALE no room for tackiness, sloppiness, and dullness. Employing old-fashioned stunts, he even succeeds in creating one very exhilarating and breath-taking chase scene that highlights in towering cranes. A sequence that literally takes you to dizzying heights.LE CHIFFRE, as portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen, is one of those cool James Bond villains, which create an unsettling diabolical presence whenever they enter a room. But this movie provides many levels of twists and turns that may take the attention away from Le Chiffre. Don't expect Le Chiffre to be the kind of stereotyped Bond villain that has super-villain abilities, that has pet scorpions, or that is spoofed by Austin Power's Dr. Evil. He certainly has no sharks that shoot lasers.Eva Green as Vesper Lynd is dazzlingly beautiful. She succeeds in playing a character that does indeed have the strength and the influence to bring in a touch of style and a sense of change in James Bond making him the man that he is. Her performance creates a fabulous chemistry with Craig's Bond. A chemistry that certainly brings out both actor & actresses' impressive acting talent. And may I add that Eva Green is far more beautiful in one scene where she has no make-up on. If I was a cartoon, my jaw would've fallen off.And about the new Bond, DANIEL CRAIG..? Well, Initially, many ladies hate him. They say he looks short and ugly like a villain. But then again, many of us guys cheer a James Bond that has more of a tough-guy action movie image. The kind that does enter a room of bad guys and leaving it with remnants of chaos. Many of us cheer for him because he personifies an action hero image that we could relate to, rugged, tough, and rebellious. But the film really reveals how much Daniel Craig proves himself to be more than worthy of being the new James Bond. Apart from his rugged physique, he delivers more spiky charm with both arrogance and a sensitive side of Bond which makes him a complex character, and that is what makes him very interesting. This film even shows a far more sensitive, loving, and romantic Bond than in any other James Bond movie (he actually says the magic words 'I Love You' in this one). Far beyond the romantic version that George Lazenby has portrayed in 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' (wherein Bond got married). Craig brings to life a more human Bond. One that actually knows how to care for something important to him and his soul, and has a nasty sense of humor even when he's being tortured.CASINO ROYALE pushes for a more believable Bond in a believable setting. There would be no volcanoes here that reveal to be mountain fortresses for villains, nor are there underwater palaces or outer space stations run by uniformed bad guys. But there are some pretty simple gadgets not worth mentioning. My guess is, that just like 'From Russia with Love', this movie sticks to the plain action-thriller formula from the Fleming books. Perhaps some of us can wait for the gadgets till the next Bond movie may come.The film is said to take James Bond 'back to his roots' in a film that would be similar to From Russia with Love where the focus was on character and plot rather than high-tech gadgets and visual effects. An issue which would surely revolutionize the James Bond genre. Incredible visuals would always be part of the James Bond genre. But after more than three decades of Bond movies marinated with overblown visuals, you would think that it's high time they got back to the roots of Bond; the thrill, the suspense, the espionage, the intrigue. We are in a movie age where many moviegoers have become desensitized by visuals. Perhaps the same reason why 'Exorcist: The Beginning' for instance, has not worked, because it relied on visuals rather than innovating raw refreshing ideas that may hit a cerebral appeal rather than the visual aspect. After years of having witnessed movies such as 'The Matrix' and the 'Star Wars' prequels, some people would be less surprised by stunts and explosions that viewers could easily dissect. CASINO ROYALE does not go that direction. It brings you back to how Bond was written the way Ian Fleming would've wanted him to be.And indeed, CASINO ROYALE does possess faithfulness with the original book by Ian Fleming from which it is based on, although there have been minimal revisions which sticks the storyline close to present-time standards.By the time I was done watching the movie, I have concluded that CASINO ROYALE is THE best James Bond movie I have ever seen. And one that has made me consider Daniel Craig one of the best Bonds, only second to the gold standard James Bond himself, Sean Connery. It is highly amusing to think that the press releases and the trailers of this film initially got mixed reactions from the public, some even going so far as to hating it. Now, they are proved wrong, because CASINO ROYALE is the finest James Bond movie that will surely remain timeless in film history.",10,1,4,17 November 2006
V for Vendetta," V FOR VENDETTA: A Work of Masterful Fiction For Our Times
","Originally set for release November 5, 2005, this movie is rumored to have been re-scheduled due to the seemingly-pro-bomber/pro-terrorist aspect of its theme which may stir controversy with regards to the London bombings on July 7 and July 21, 2005. The film-makers have denied this, and say it was delayed to allow more time for production, explaining that the visual effects would not be completed in time.But as terroristic as some articles and features may accuse it to be, the main character of this movie, a masked vigilante who calls himself 'V' really is just a rebel extremist bent on toppling the current dictatorial government that is reigning in tyrannical power over an oppressed nation. Set in a dark & grim not-so-distant-futuristic Europe, the storyline centers upon its two main characters; the vigilante V, who's scarred by a traumatic horrific past, and Evey Hammond, who's also a victim of her own traumatic past when her family all perished in political violence. When they both have become wanted by the government, the Police Inspector hunting them down uncovers dark secrets that may prove the depth of how evil and corrupt the government he works for really is.This movie is based on the graphic novel from DC's Vertigo comics, written by Alan Moore and illustrated mostly by David Lloyd. The film is directed by James McTeigue, who has served as assistant director and second unit director in many big films such as the Matrix movies and Star Wars: Episode II. This movie marks his first project as the director, and indeed has done a great job, balancing the darkness of V's character with his more sympathetic side. McTeigue was also able to create a realistic totalitarian Britain, as well as the struggles, the torment, and the sense of vigilance that ignites among its citizens. This film is produced by respectable filmmakers Joel Silver, Grant Hill, and the Wachowski brothers; Larry & Andy Wachowski, who has gained mass popularity with their revolutionary Matrix movies, and has written a draft of the script in the '90s before they worked on the Matrix.The central character V, draws inspiration from Guy Fawkes, a legendary Catholic revolutionary in the early 1600s who intended to blow-up the British Parliament, his conviction was to create chaos and disorder in the country from which, it was hoped, a new monarch and political regime sympathetic to the Catholic cause would emerge. But he was captured on November 5, 1605. He was tortured and publicly hanged. Evey year across England on November 5th, bonfires blaze and fireworks light the sky in celebration of the foiling of Fawkes' plot to overturn King and government. There are also elements of Victor Hugo's 'Phantom of the Opera' in V's storyline, as his tale poses parallels with the characters of the Phantom & Christine Daae.What sets this film apart from other futuristic fictions is that it is highly political and is very reflective on many of the nations and governments of our times. As do many existing governments, the government in V demands an unflinching loyalty from its citizenry, warning them not to question the government or else they will be met with the highest penalties of law. These are the governments that brand those who seek and intend to reveal the truth as seditionists, and destabilizers. These are the governments that brand activists and freedom fighters as terrorists and anarchists. These are the governments who control the media in order to restrain doubt and a sense of check & balance, and propagate their own manufactured versions of truth. This is the kind of government that drives V to struggle against. His quest for vengeance is fueled by his desire to topple the existing corrupt and totalitarian government, hoping that in its ashes will rise a government for the better future of his country.V is played by Hugo Weaving, who's well-known for portraying Elrond in the Lord of the Rings movies and the cool icon villain Mr. Smith in the Matrix movies. As V, Weaving proves that he can still be an absolutely expressive actor even when he's wearing a mask. His physique, body movement, and his cool and calmly malevolent voice all add up to truly bring a charming, well-educated, and even often poetic, but lethally dangerous assassin, to life.Natalie Portman is not only alluring, but is also a flawless actress with focus and quite a solid performance, as a woman with her own conflicts and a convincing awakening, as she allies herself with the cause that V is fighting for. Portman struck media attention when she had her head shaved for this movie, but then again, she revealed that she has looked forward to shave her head for quite a long time. Her character represents those who have become victims of government abuse and has grown to succumb to the fear and the silence that is implemented, but later awakens to the call for struggle and rebellion.Stephen Rea plays a great third-person protagonist, playing the analytical game & solving the puzzles of the past, as a chief inspector hunting down V, but unravels the dirt & evil of the government that he works for. He represents that character who, is never himself a victim of the government's abuse, but does not go against it so as to preserve a sense of orderly peace.And then, there's John Hurt whose attention-shattering performance as a dictatorial chancellor of Britain is obviously patterned after Hitler.This movie is truly a great political epic without resorting on unnecessary explosions, dull chase scenes and expensive stunts that other blockbuster borefests would have. Its impact is more on the storyline and the thrill. V FOR VENDETTA is, by far, the most profoundly-spectacular movie I've seen this year. Highly-dramatic despite its action genre image, and thought-provokingly reflective. V FOR VENDETTA is SUPERB!",9,17,34,15 March 2006
