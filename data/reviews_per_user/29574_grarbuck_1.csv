Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Liked it so much, I've seen it 5 times already.
","I personally liked 'Menace.'  I was able to see it the first day without waiting in a line overnight like a couple of friends I know.  I think the key for me was the fact I toned down my expectations of the film.  When I heard of the film's production nearly 2 years ago, I was excited, but I kept telling myself as the time grew nearer, 'I've waited this long, a couple more weeks wouldn't kill me.'  I will also go out on a limb and say that Jar Jar and the other Gungans didn't bother me in the least bit.  Everyone else I know to the exception of a few disliked them with a vengeance.  To the critics who have blasted the character development of characters like Obi-Wan, that character was already developed!!!  Don't forget that 22 years ago, Star Wars was big, but without the subsequent films that followed, the storyline was not all that great.  This is why these films are considered a saga.  The films are all tied together.  Space operas are that way by definition.  When Episodes 2 and 3 come out, I am willing to bet my life that those who waited in line for this one way too long and was disappointed will see that this is yet another look into George Lucas' genius writing abilities.  Besides, he can only fit so much into 2+ hours!PS - Another note to the critics who will automatically dislike a movie because of the hype surrounding it...  The hype was not generated by big bad Hollywood, it was created years ago by us, the LOYAL STAR WARS FANS!",10,0,0,2 June 1999
