Scarface," Unspectacular but satisfying
","Small spoilers (I describe a few scenes in sparse detail).Scarface, while it can claim no real originality (and indeed is based on an older movie which I have not seen), is an entertaining and well-done movie about the rise and fall of a crime boss.  Naturally, the plot has been done to death, but Al Pacino helps as the consistently good and occasionally excellent lead, and the acting all around is reasonably bearable and convincing.  The score, while a bit too 80s at times, fits well with Tony's rage, and generally adds to the suspense of the film.The main merit of this film is its unrelenting portrayal of the criminal life.  The camera somehow manages to maintain a sense of the headstrong stupidity which Pacino captures so well, accentuating the unpredictable and ruthless attitude of the protagonist.  In no way does the film attempt to soften or to justify Tony's extreme and for the most part imprudent actions. He is not a good guy who has to do a couple of violent things to stay on top.  From the beginning, he is a sadistic idiot, and as he says in the chillingly great restaurant scene, he is the bad guy.  He is stubborn to the end, and it is partly his inane impenitence that makes his character so memorable.  This is the way the film remains suspenseful, as well, because the audience never knows what this crazy guy is going to do next.  The ending, while I won't spoil it, fits perfectly with his character and the film refuses to withhold a single blow from its audience even here in its dying throes.  The reason this film is great is because Tony is not a hero, but a villain, and furthermore that it never condescends to give him any heroic traits.  The movie itself is as ruthless as Tony, and it is the masterful relationship between film and character in this film that combines to leave a lasting impact.  [8/10]",8,0,1,24 December 2003
Memento," I guess I'm hopping on the bandwagon...
","Mild spoilers follow; general comments on aspects, no revelations here.Normally I have a tendency to take issue with the status quo and play devil's advocate.  Stupid?  Perhaps.  Amusing?  Most definitely.  Memento, however, overcomes my instinct by its nature as a piece of nearly flawless filmmaking.  Any mundane aspects of the plot are completely obscured by the incredible structure of the film, and indeed, the simplicity of the story (insofar as one can know the real story) is a perfect complement to the film's complex execution.  The incredible acting, particularly by Guy Pearce, also makes Leonard's shattered world a convincing if not a completely comfortable place to reside for a few hours.  While some of the lines are not perfectly executed, the script for the most part is brilliant.To this, add masterful cinematography which emphasizes the way in which Leonard is forced to live: shots which imitate a jarring blow, a slip of memory, deja vu...  The protagonist's entire experience is mirrored excellently in each shot.As for the mood, get ready for some realistic suspense.  Ever wake up and forget where you are, or even just wake up thinking you were facing the other way in bed?  Makes your heart race a little, doesn't it?  Now imagine your life in danger, searching for meaning in a broken reality, in which every second you are bombarded by new surroundings that rise up from a few minutes of hazy memory.  Suspense is the fear of the unknown, and in this film, nothing is known for certain.  Hence, it is one of the most suspenseful films I can remember.The best part is this film's repeat performance value.  I am not one to easily sit through a movie (or even a song) twice unless I truly loved it, and even then I normally like to wait a while.  Having just seen the film for the third time, I can say that every time was more enjoyable than the previous.  As you are less confounded by the sheer unorthodoxy of the film, you begin to take in details which make the film not a shallow experiment in film making but a rich world behind a broken lens.  I guarantee that you will come to understand things better and to spot amazing clues as you watch the film additional times.  There are some images gone in a blink, or conversation easily overlooked. Your mind simply filters out some of the dialogue as meaningless since you have no stable references on a first viewing.  Having grasped the plot, you will now have the necessary understanding to enjoy together all the intricacies of the dialogue.Overall, a great film.  It is an intelligent idea executed with true genius. [10/10]",Null,0,3,12 July 2003
Finding Nemo," Not Perfect but Surely Entertaining
","Despite its sometimes sappy and clichÃ© plot, this is a fun movie.  Many of its jokes fall flat, incomprehensible to the child audience yet too immature for the adults.  On the other hand, the many references to other movies (The Shining and Psycho) are hilariously fitting.  The animation is often stunning, with all the creatures filled with vitality.  What's cooler than the mysteries of the deep, and this film presents them charmingly.  I laughed out loud one or two times, but I smiled a lot, and I didn't feel patronized (much) by the film's targetting of a youthful audience.  Overall fun and entertaining.

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," I laughed a very few times in spite of myself
","Having seen the previews, I thought this movie would pretty much be How to Lose a Guy Viewer in 10 Minutes.  To my credit, I saw it on an airplane to Hawaii and paid nothing extra to see it.  To the film's credit, it managed to keep me staring at it for its duration.  Plot-wise, there is nothing to say.  Everything you need to know is explained in the previews.  There is not a split second of suspense throughout the entire film.  Yet this is entirely expected and to hope for a complex storyline is to be sitting through the wrong film.  The acting was exactly what was expected, the cinematography wholly unremarkable, the realism unsurprisingly lacking, and the score unmemorable.  Realistically, the only elements that have a chance of redeeming the film are the romance and the comedy.  Considering the nature of the film, the romance is, like all else, as predictable and superficial as the rest of the film, although not as annoying as it might have been.  So we come to the aspect of humor.  I must say, that despite all of these markedly low expectations and the desire not to laugh at such a tragic example of the flaws of American culture, the film was overall fairly amusing.  I found myself smiling or laughing enough to keep me from unplugging the headphones from the armrest and unplugging my mind from its consciousness.  Kate Hudson, whose acting in Almost Famous was good if memory serves, pulled off the role as reasonably as can be expected for a film with such low potential.  McConaughey was also occasionally funny, although perhaps his friends were the most humorous.  Overall, while I couldn't recommend it to anyone, I know those who like this sort of drivel will see it anyway, and for its genre it's slightly more bearable than similar films.  See it if you have little dignity, little choice, and little expectation, and you may laugh a little.  [5/10]",5,0,0,5 July 2003
The Italian Job," Heist Adventure
","While it was a fairly typical heist movie, this film was more in the adventure category to me than action.  Its lack of cursing, violence, and sex in some ways was refreshing, but on the other hand it did lose some of the grittiness of a movie about lowlifes.  I'm not saying that there needs to be another movie in which everyone betrays each other and ends up dead, but rather that the honor among thieves theme may have been pushed too far in this movie.The energetic and enjoyable score and the cool but entirely unartistic camera work help to give the movie some of its character.  The acting was fine, with nobody particularly memorable and without much opportunity for good acting; despite this, the characters' individual talents were fun throughout the film.  Two static but still entertaining characters are 'Napster' (who's funny) and Handsome Rob (who's just sweet).  The plot is utterly predictable in every way; they made no attempt to disguise Steve's betrayal at the beginning (even though I'm informed that the previews showed this--never watch TV).  Neither was there any doubt over whether Stella would help them.  As a result many of the early scenes were dry and cliché.The action scenes are typical, but typically entertaining.  I was impressed by the fact that they made those stupid looking minicoopers semi-cool, and the final elaborate plan unfolds rather well.  If you're into heists or cool non-violent action but you don't mind a Deus ex Machina, a trite plot, and an unmemorable cast, this is one for you.  I should mention that for reasons entirely unfathomable to me, my female friends seem to be of the ludicrous consensus that Ed Norton and Mark Wahlberg are hot (never mentioning Jason Statham whose coolness boosts him far above them IMO), so if you're one of those kind of people that might make the film better for you.

Lilo & Stitch," Not Disney's Greatest
","Lilo and Stitch in no regard achieves the level of Disney classics like Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King in my mind, possibly because my nostalgia for childhood overshadows the flaws of those films for me.  On the other hand, it does have a number of funny scenes and the same appealing animation. Furthermore, it marks a departure from the fairy-tale trend in earlier Disney movies to give science fiction a go (some of the ways in which it parodies this genre are pretty intelligent).  Lilo is a good character, if somewhat inconsistent, and Stitch supports a large part of the film with his destructive antics.  The movie as a whole, however, never really knows how to resolve the conflicts within itself.  The transformation of Stitch to family member is contrived and marks an artificial conclusion to the film.  Although David's pidgin and many local stereotypes set the atmosphere for the film, it fails to truly reconcile the oddity of the aliens with the Hawaiian setting; the aliens vacillate between being other-worldly and being human.  Such inconsistencies prevent the viewer from feeling really satisfied with the film in its entirety, and while animation normally makes the willing suspension of disbelief easier, this one pushes it.  However, both Lilo and Stitch are reasonably likeable characters, particularly for children (like my sister), and there are enough clever ideas to make the film worth seeing if you're in the mood.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," There have been worse sequels
","Small spoilers follow; I describe a few scenes but don't give much away. While I'm not exactly an authority on the first two films, I recall well enough what happens in those, and this one makes a good follow up.  Despite this film's somewhat wandering plot and cliché cliffhanger of an ending, it is pretty enjoyable.  The acting is not spectacular, but two of the four central characters are supposed to be robots, so what do you expect?  The camerawork is often interesting, and the film has quite a few humorous moments.  The action is great (but not incredible) throughout.  The chase, while obviously enormously expensive, had sort of a breakneck speed.  While I'm aware that this is the nature of car chases, the pace of the cutting removed my ability to focus on the action and get a real sense of suspense (see the motorcycle/truck chase of the second).  Much of the movie is at least somewhat gripping, though, and I found myself wanting to know what will happen next more often than waiting for the standard fare to play itself out.  The premise with its innumerable incarnations still manages to support the film without seeming too stale. I think most will agree that the one-on-one duel between the machines is quite a spectacle.  Overall, solid action and worth seeing.  [6/10]",6,0,0,12 July 2003
Being John Malkovich," Worth seeing
","Warning: Slight spoilers, just one-liner descriptions of scenes in the movie that might be funnier if you haven't read this, but no revelation of any major elements.While I wouldn't call this film a metaphysical analysis of identity, it does raise a few interesting questions about the nature of individual humans as mortals.  That is coincidental, however, to the humor that abounds in a world where old people can live forever by hopping from brain to brain of young people.  There are a great number of memorable scenes, including the always hilarious falls into the ditch, Cameron Diaz locked in her monkey's cage, and Malkovich's monumental switch from actor to puppeteer are some of them.  The dialogue is also funny.  One criticism is that once a viewer gets over the initial weirdness of the idea, the plot sort of falls out as a result.  Many loops are thrown in terms of explanation of the original idea, but not so much as changes in the plot itself.  Not as philosophical as one might hope, but it takes a funny idea and makes it better. 7/10",Null,0,1,27 May 2003
The Usual Suspects," Excellent Film
","Warning: Possible spoilers, but it would be hard to find a review of this film without any.I just finished watching this film for the second time, and it was even more enjoyable and interesting.  More enjoyable just because I got to reassess every scene with my knowledge of the incredible ending.  More interesting because even under such scrutiny, the acting and cinematography fit perfectly with the mind-boggling conclusion.  If the story is unbelievable in parts, then that is perfectly fitting.  Part of this film's beauty lies in the false endings which multiple times lead a viewer to think he/she has outwitted the film and anticipated the ending.  For me, at least, the realization of the truth (insofar as this movie permits any real truth to be found) was sudden and unexpected, only seconds before the film revealed it to me.  Great analysis of the gullibility of viewers and the willingness of an audience to accept whatever is shown to them. 9/10",Null,0,1,27 May 2003
The Pianist," Nothing redeeming about this drivel...
","Having read a fair amount about the Warsaw Ghetto, this movie seemed to trivialize it to me. I know that I am not stating a popular opinion, but I found that this film, which put so little into character development and so much into plot, was a failure. *We already know the plot*. So what is the point of the film? Nothing, in my opinion, it adds nothing to what has already been established, and pales in comparison to reading memoirs from the people who were there. Even in terms of plot, there are jagged edges in this film and it is generally an unsmooth and uninteresting ride through material that has been covered ad infinitum by better writers. Rarely have I been this bored in a movie. The violence, I felt, was extremely Hollywood--it was meant to portray the evil Germans against the good Jews. Not that I am a Nazi, but such a ridiculous simplification annoys me. More interesting is how an entire nation (Germany) could allow this to happen--a point which goes entirely unaddressed as we watch three hours of another Jew in another awful situation. A member of the Einsatzgruppen who was killing the Jews was as much a person as Szpilman, with emotions and responses just like his.  The fact that they are destroying other humans does not mean that they themselves are not human, although this fact is ignored in this movie and others by portraying them as monsters.  Isn't there some psychological (and as a result, cinematic) ground to break here?  I feel that most people are familiar with the experience of the Jews--if we must revisit this part of history again, why not try it in a different way?  I hope I don't offend anyone with these comments, because I don't mean to marginalize the suffering that happened, but I feel that with distance we get clarity about a situation. Since no large group (to my limited knowledge of the world) still misunderstands the holocaust, this type of emotional drivel is pointless and gets the public riled up over something long dead, without adding anything new whatsoever.",3,4,9,28 May 2003
The Transporter," Plot holes? Of course, but who cares?
","If you were expecting an involving, strongly emotional film during which you form a relationship with the characters, then how did you end up with this film?  Sure, the characters are flat, and even the plot has some big problems.  Just get your cartoon-sensibilities out and try to enjoy it!That said, the score is somewhat enjoyable in my opinion, the camerawork is outstanding (if it doesn't bug the hell out of you which it seems to do to some people).  There's not much to be said for any of the actors apart from Jason Statham, who is perfect for the part.  Someone mentioned that he has the Bruce Willis look going on, which is true, while he also has that cool accent.  And those are two guys who can pull off having receding hairlines without going totally skinhead and looking like a slab of meat (like Vin Diesel).  If you liked that look and accent in Snatch or the Italian Job you will probably like it here too.  In my opinion he is a perfect action hero: cool, calm, in control, powerful, fast, and anything but annoying.  Most heroes fail in one of these respects at some point during a film.So now the important part: the action sequences.  These really make up for the lack of coherence and character development.  Maybe you think that nothing could make up for a lack of coherence; well obviously you're not the action type and should stay away from this film!  If you can get over it, then some of the scenes are quite beautifully done, so rhythmic and well-choreographed as to look like dancing.  Some of the scenes are reminiscent of Kiss of the Dragon (and even one of the villains is the same guy).  That reminds my brothers and I watched it, we were many times reminded of other action movies: Ronin, Speed, Terminator 2, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Lethal Weapon 4, The Professional, the Fast and the Furious (some of these are not surprising due to their mutual associations with Luc Besson).  But while you might just think it copies these other films, it basically does many of the cooler things in these films in a borderline montage of action that leaves you with a sense of tribute to the genre rather than a copycat.  Plus, it has many scenes which are extremely original.  Overall, if you're into the action, this movie has some intense and spectacular scenes.  If you aren't, don't see this movie so we don't have to hear you complain about it. [7/10]",7,0,0,26 June 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," Hate to say it, but... Riveting
","The smallest of spoilers.  Despite its lumbering and sometimes excruciating pace, this movie kept my eyes locked on the screen.  It is not that the film is pleasant to watch; on the contrary, many times it makes its viewing extremely difficult.  Yet it is so rich in detail and realism that it has a sort of twisted charm to it.  Not that the plot is realistic, because few would say that Bill Harford had a typical night.  Instead, it is the human emotion which is real, and in many ways it is the sheer brilliance of the acting that makes this bizarre situation into a hauntingly familiar one. Tom Cruise is perfect for the role, and some have argued this is not because of his talent, but the fact that he is not a good actor.  Kubrick seemed to play on this, and molded the character of Harford into one who is at once acting and not acting, real and fake.  This is made possible by the strange relationship between actor and character in this case--this is definitely not Tom Cruise's typical role.Kidman, on the other hand, is absolutely superb.  Having read that Kubrick had forced her to film some scenes hundreds of times until she was crying after each shoot, I expected some sincere acting.  She well exceeded my expectations, however, with such strikingly poignant acting that I was almost immediately drawn into the lives of this semi-functional couple. Without her, how could Harford have the drive to do what he does in the film?  She is excellent, as are all of the supporting actors and even those in even one scene (the desk-clerk, Domino, Mandy, etc).The cinematography is also top-notch.  If my eyes did not deceive me, there were some strange tricks in this film.  I saw an eye move across Harford's back as he enters his home in one scene (replayed it like 5 times to confirm it).  Things like that combined with the already outstanding camerawork add another layer of macabre deception which the film embraces.  Near the beginning, when Kidman is describing what happened at Cape Cod, there is another artful use of the camera as it follows her hysterics, nodding downwards to watch as she collapses with laughter.  Given that this was an unfinished movie by Kubrick, the high quality of the cinematography overall is a tribute to his genius.The score was simple and repetitive--and yet so enormously effective.  Those piano notes, reaching their apex when Harford returns home near the conclusion of the film, are really only a few dissonant notes, but they mix with the visual imagery and the atmosphere of the film to become a cacophany in the mind of the viewer.  There are numerous musical references in the film as well.  The score fits perfectly with the ambiance of the film.The suspense of this film was maintained at a high level throughout, reminiscent somewhat of Blue Velvet with its inexplicable darkness, which is one of the most suspenseful films I have ever seen.  Certainly there is a Lynchian element in the darkness of the film and the way the film's reality changes drastically during the conversation with Ziggler.  And yet, while discordant realities may be Lynch's specialty, Kubrick focuses on the depraved reality, all the locations of his films having their own psychology which can essentially go insane the way his protagonists are wont to do.  We are given reality filtered through the protagonist's increasingly unstable psychology, and this film is an extraordinary example of it.This film is not for everyone.  It is long, it is dark, it does not have a typical easily-understood plot.  It is character-driven, and at that, features a character whose reality many viewers would not be comfortable to reside in for three hours.  It is not easily understood.  It is not all that it seems, but is more like a message from Kubrick whose ideas I can really only scratch.  If you're intrigued, you will probably enjoy this film.  If you're disgusted, you will probably hate it.  I doubt there's many who fall in the middle. [9/10]",Null,1,2,16 August 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Self-righteous, hyped, and overrated, but in the end, an average flick
","This film fails to top the original, and that film did not particularly impress me in the first place.  This second attempt at a fusion of fighting and philosophy ends up being a confusing blend of pseudo-intellectualism, blatant and stupid symbols, and aesthetic but unsatisfying action.  The plot itself is somewhat directionless, meandering from place to place in search of action and 'answers' without really finding anything.  This is not aided by the acting; at the start of the film, upon seeing Neo, a friend humorously and correctly predicted that Keanu Reeves would keep the same expression the entire movie.  Morpheus' lines are worse than in the original, and Lawrence Fishburne does a worse job with them.  The failed attempts at presenting a meaningful look at the dichotomy between man and machine are brought out in the early scenes, making the first half of the movie not only slow but pointless.  Enter Councilor Hamann looking like the Wizard of Oz to waste ten minutes with such insights as 'Some machines are bad; others are good.'  The irony is his own realization that for all his speaking he made no point; unfortunately, this insight was lost on those who could have removed the pointless scene from the movie.While the supporting characters are somewhat acceptable, the Architect takes the cake as one of the worst characters I've seen onscreen.  Purporting to be the knowledgeable authority with answers to Neo's questions, he simply presents a line of inconsequential jargon that leaves the audience universally dumbfounded.  For a large majority of the people to whom I spoke, they simply didn't understand what he is saying, so beset is it with laughable stabs at intelligent vocabulary.  For another group, however, his message is easily understandable, but to these the character appears even more ridiculous, for they realize how utterly devoid of meaning is everything he says.  Transforming even the simplest idea into a forty-second oration of crap, the Architect manages to use more words more incorrectly than I have ever heard in a major motion picture.  His odious presence in the film is surely one of its greatest handicaps, since he is central to Neo's mission (and thus the plot).  His speeches, as well as many others in this poor, confused film speak volumes of the problems with popularity. It is almost as if the masses saw the first Matrix, said, 'Wow, that's deep!' The Wachowski brothers then looked at each other, shrugged, and said, 'Why not deeper?' and dove into a whole world of convoluted casuistry.That said, the cinematography, score, and action are all acceptable-for an action movie.  If one enters expecting not true cinema, but rather some special effects more or less rammed down one's throat, it is somewhat bearable.  In the end, the film is rather average.  However, while most average films are not above poking fun at themselves, The Matrix remains self-righteous for its duration, and in taking itself so seriously it proceeds to do itself more harm than good.  Go in to see some expensive CG which is in some parts actually worse than the effects of the first (Neo looks like a pixel-y video game character in many of the scenes) and you may or may not be entertained.
