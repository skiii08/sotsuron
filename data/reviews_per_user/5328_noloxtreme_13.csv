Deja Vu," Wrong Approach
","Lets get to it.What initially intrigued me about the movie was the time-machine gizmo could only be used to view the past. This is new as most time-machine movies involve going back to the past to change things, which I find to be very annoying.The movie would've been much better if thats all the time-machine could do. And even when it was established that you could interfere with the past, the movie explored the theme that you cannot change the past, which would've also been adequate, but we all know this is Hollywood. You must save the world, so they basically messed up what could've been a great movie.And the terrorist guy seemed to also hint at the theme of not being able to change the past, but for some reason the story took the mediocre, uncreative, dull approach.Very disappointing movie, its watchable, but I'm giving it a 1 because in the beginning it looked like it could be a classic, but degenerated into mediocrity, so I think thats a tragedy.Don't watch this movie.",1,27,48,15 September 2007
Unbreakable," UNBEATABLE-when you 'Get It'
","Contains a Lot Of SpoilersUnbreakable by Night Shayamalan is a story about a superhero. Shayamalan's interpretation of superhero is between the exaggerated comic book Super hero, and a normal everyday type of hero-like a police officer. To summarize the storyline, David Dunn is the sole survivor of a horrible train wreck, which brings him into the attention of an art dealer, Elijah Price, Elijah has some genetic abnormality which makes his bones very, very weak. David Dunn is a father and is also having marriage problems, but discovers that he can do extraordinary things.Now that the formalities are finished, did I like the movie? After my initial viewing, it left a bad taste in my mouth, I still liked the movie, but I didn't 'get it'. Not that anyone that doesn't like the movie doesn't get it, but here's why I didn't like it initially.The movie ends very abruptly, we go from discovering he is really a super hero, to ending very rapidly, and I felt as if that was rushed. Then again, the climax of movies like The Usual Suspects, The Matrix and The Sixth sense is also based on an abrupt ending, but the delivery here was a bit off. Despite that, the Movie is very good, that's why I gave it a rating of 8, it lost 2 stars because of the abrupt ending, but the movie is exceptional for the reasons given below.Explanation-SpoilersIt's difficult to understand the movie on the first viewing, because of many things, one of those is because of preconceived notion of superheroes. The clich√©d superhero movies like the X-men, I kept on waiting for a mad scientist to explain how David Dunn was a mutant because of Gamma ray radiation, but no such explanation came, which was again part of the movies message. The Movie is about a superhero in a real-world type of situation. In fact, Elijah Price repeatedly on many occasions stresses the fact that comic books are an exaggeration of the real world, that is the central theme of this movie. Even when we are introduced to Elijah as an adult, in the very first scene he explains how the original comic book depictions were different from the one's released commercially, that the one's released commercially were an exaggeration. Central theme, which is repeated over and over again. The problem is when you watch this movie expected one type of movie, instead of more of a human drama, involving a hero and his arch-enemy. We are taken on a journey, revealing that David Dunn is indeed a super hero.Typical comic Hero1. At least one person knows their secret, and is their side kick. (David Dunn's son) 2. The woman in the hero's life doesn't know their secret(David Dunn's wife) 3. Weakness(water) 4. Arch-enemy, who is the opposite of the hero(Elijah)Typical comic Villain1. Troubled youth 2. Very intelligent 3. Believes that the ends justify the means, even if the means require the deaths of thousands 4. Criminally insaneThis movie parallels a Typical comic book perfectly, so the movie achieved exactly what it set out to achieve.What's brilliant is that, even at the end of the movie, we are given a hint that Elijah is an arch villain. Elijah's mother tells us about how arch-villains are portrayed in comics. They have larger eyes to indicate that they have a slightly bigger eyes to indicate that they have a skewed way of looking at reality.Anyways, yep, the Movie was Exceptional, once you get it.",8,0,0,26 October 2007
Creed," Creed has potential
","I'm a big fan of the first Rocky film, and I suppose I like the other films in the series as well. Creed is a solid film, that has a good premise. Creed's illegitimate's son, trying to walk in the footsteps of a father he never knew. I can honestly say that I was with the film at the beginning, that premise is intriguing to me.But strangely enough, I think the film started to tail off when Rocky was introduced into the story. As someone else had said, Rocky's life had become a bit too depressing, with Adrian, Robert and Paulie gone. The old fire of the Italian Stallion was just not there, this is not how I would've imagined Rocky's life ended up.Anyways, back to Adonis. As I stated before, the premise of one of Apollo's son wanting to follow in his footsteps is intriguing. But I think the filmmakers/writer's took a wrong turn as to how that was supposed to happen. Apollo to me represented something different from Rocky. Rocky represented heart, stubbornness, believing and hoping against hope. Whereas Apollo represents grace and skill. The silky guy BORN with the talent. A Mozart, a genius.So the fight between Rocky and Apollo to me was a clash between unbelievable desire and unbelievable talent. So if Adonis was to follow in his father's footsteps, I think the Rocky way did not suit him. I think the writer's should've emphasized the natural talent as opposed to being able to take a beating.This movie also lacks a captivating 'antagonist' like Apollo. Anyways, I liked the movie. I had hoped they would go another way with it. The movie gets a lot right. e.g. I could buy the love story between Adonis and Bianca.With that said, Creed is a solid 7. It's a nice change from the usual comic book movies.",7,0,3,3 December 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," George Lucas. This is how Prequels are done.
","I've seen almost every comic book based movie released recently, and I must say this movie is very refreshing.I watched the other X-men movies, but the only thing I can say about them is that they are watchable, but nothing really special. So I wasn't expecting much when I watched this movie, but to my surprise, I was actually hooked from the beginning to the end. It felt more like I was watching an epic than a normal comic book movie.The graphics aren't the greatest you'll find, but if i had to choose between an excellent plot and good graphics, I would choose an excellent plot, and it certainly delivers.Like my title says, George Lucas, this is how prequels should be made, maybe someone will remake starwars episodes I-III.",9,19,48,20 April 2009
X-Men," Unforgettable- NOT!
","First of all, I like COmic books, I've been a fan of the X-men. Not a very big fan, but I've always found the story extremely fascinating. Heck, I found the 30 minute animated episodes better than this film. I understand that its a challenge turning the X-men into a live feature film, with real characters, and I shouldn't compare the animated series with the movie too much. With that being said, here's why I think this movie is awful? 1. The saying goes, its better to be the only country with a nuclear bomb in the world, then to have a thousand nuclear bombs,in a world where everybody else has one. what do I mean? Too many mutants with super powers isn't as impressive as having a few super-powered mutants. That was a very big let down, they shouldn't have used the whole mutant school angle, I don't really care about a bunch of kids, who don't contribute anything to the story, who have powers. 2. The fight sequences. Mystique being a kung-fu master. That just doesn't seem right. Its not about mystique, the collision between the bad guys and good guys seems very bad, I wasn't impressed at all by the battles, they needed better fighting scenes. 3. Like some other reviewer has suggested by saying that a movie focusing on just wolverine could have been more successful. I agree, that the story of a FEW key mutant characters could have been the better way to go. Character development, the story could have gone deeper. 4. Love triangles. Haven't they been overdone by now. They really annoy me, for heavens sake, choose someone and get it over with. The route taken in Cinderella man is better. A love affair between a husband and wife for a change. 5. I didn't want to mention the plot, but I've seen the first two movies, the plot is DREADFUL.In conclusion...Very disappointing, I expected more, I know its a challenge, but hasn't Hollywood had enough experience experimenting with comic book heroes. This is unacceptable quality.",1,3,10,23 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Let the past die (cough cough 'The last jedi'), kill it if you must.
","I went into this movie with low expectations after the last jedi and solo, a star wars movie, and I was very very pleasantly surprised.
I was not bored for a single moment once watching this movie. The movie is humorous and action packed. J.J Abram brought back star wars from the brink after the Ryan Johnson fiasco that was the last jedi.
Way to go Disney.
I know this review doesn't go into details of what happens in the movie, I just recommend that you as the viewer, go and see the movie for yourself, and let the past die ('the last jedi'), kill it if you must.",10,4,10,20 December 2019
Justice League," Justice League: Superhero movie done by the numbers
","Well congratulations comic book fanboys. You've done it. When Jack Snyder and DC set out to create these DC films they wanted to do something different from Marvel. They had a different style and different vision and different direction.But due to the cinematic palette of the average viewer being unsophisticated and comic book fanboys; the studio and director were beaten into submission. And the original direction they had in mind has since been abandoned to create a set of movies that do it by the numbers. We've almost seen everything here done before. Note, I don't think a movie has to be different in order to be enjoyable-it can certainly have things we have seen before, but the film is extremely formulaic. 1. Thousands of throwaway and easily disposable alien/robot henchmen. 2. An obscure villain you've never heard of unless you're a huge comic book fan (Whose steppen-wolf?). 3. Some sort of beam in the sky, or some tower or some sort of gizmo to be destroyed or the world will end. 4. Little to no lasting consequences.Now while I don't think a film has to have a dark tone to be enjoyable, but since the backlash against actual consequences occurring in Man of Steel. The DC film offers after Man of Steel have been consequence free. You get these extremely powerful enemies that can wreak havoc, but very little civilian casualties. You get the scene where superman leaves fighting Steppen-wolf to go and help out a couple of civilians. Okay!? End-of-world or go help single family in car?But I don't blame the studio or director. Give the people what they want. Once superhero movie fatigue sets in, maybe they could then try again to do what they had been going for in the beginning.This is a question I've always had? Why was it not okay for Superman to kill Zod but it's okay for him and other superhero's to kill the parademons and doomsday? Killing is killing isn't it? I noticed the scene at the end where the justice league let the parademons attack Steppen-wolf instead of them finishing the job. Okay!? It's what the fans want I guess and film makers must find a way of disposing of the villains without causing offense.Anyways, solid movie, I'll give it a 6. But I don't blame the studio, they just want a return on their investment.",6,1,4,17 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Meh.
","Let's face it. Let's be honest. It was always going to be next to impossible to live up to the hype. Star wars fans have built up star wars to such heights that it was always going to be next to impossible, that unless the director was a Christopher Nolan level genius, it was always going to fail.
I won't blame Disney, as these days, it's going to be next to impossible-unless you're Marvel, who seem to be the the only one's who can get it right-to please everyone. These movies try to please everyone and end up alienating the hardcore fans. I'm sure casual movie goers will like this movie fine, but fans with a little more invested, won't. 
As others have said. The mysteries introduced in the force awakens have very poor resolutions. Luke Skywalker apparently decided to abandon the galaxy to the dark side because of his own personal failures as a teacher. Yeah, Luke. One mistake, just give up. Apparently Snoke wanted to find Luke badly in the first movie for some reason, but there was no actual reason. As Luke was meh. They made it seem as if Luke held the key to defeating the first order. Luke didn't even win one battle in this movie, so apparently Snoke doesn't know what he's doing.
The will they won't thing between Finn and Rey (I know it's not the 1990's so this is outdated anyways), has become a potential love triangle.
Oh, the whole, I must complete the training of Kylo Ren thing was also just ignored btw, so just forget about that. And the cool mask and the new lightsaber, again, just forget about that. Doesn't matter as well.
Anyways, that's it. I won't go into the many, many flaws of the movie.",5,0,0,17 December 2017
Arrival," Does not live up to the hype
","Unfortunately Arrival does not live up to the extreme hype. From the critics ratings you would believe that it's the 21st century Citizen Kane or Godfather. It isn't. While I did not dislike the movie, it is enjoyable enough; but saying this movie is better than Interstellar let alone Contact is way off the mark. My wait for a very good science fiction movie since Interstellar and ex-machina goes on.The premise of the movie is about communicating with another vastly different species, akin to us communicating with ants, as an example is certainly an intriguing premise; but the premise to me was not profound enough to have me thinking about it after leaving the cinema, it wasn't even enough to keep me engaged in the movie for the entire length of the film.To me really good science fiction is not really that much about the characters. For example, I don't consider star wars to be science fiction and Star trek to a lesser extent, because they are character driven stories, whereas science fiction it's about the environment, and a particular concept that acts on the characters and is bigger than the characters. The star of the show for Interstellar is the concept of 'interstellar-travel' and the implications of faster than light travel. The star of the show for Contact is the concept of humans coming into 'contact' with an alien species in modern times. But really the intriguing part about contact is the realism of the contact. You can imagine people really acting and reacting like that to such an extra- ordinary event. The main focus isn't Ellie(Jodie Foster's character).Arrival does not work, like the aforementioned movies, because the movie is too character focused because the premise is really not intriguing enough to hold together an entire movie. Whereas in 'Contact' deciphering the communication with the aliens was just 'a part' of the whole, not the entire premise. Not only that, the tension was literally manufactured. The deciphering of the alien language was not exciting enough, it turned out to be these circle ink-blots. Okay, so what. What other incites of the universe or philosophy are we gathering from this? And the tension was completely manufactured. Because Contact was right. Any communication with a sentient intelligent species while it would take time, it would be based on the universal language of science and mathematics. 1+1 is always equal to 2. Any alien that shares this universe with us, is under the same laws of physics, therefore such statements will always be true. Even if you talked to primitive humans, you can easily grunt and point to fire and say 'hot' and they would understand what you're talking about. What that means is that establishing communication cannot be the entire premise of the movie.",6,3,8,16 November 2016
Prometheus," Pointless movie
","I don't know what the point of this movie was. Was the purpose of the movie to setup two or three more sequels, in order to milk the cash cow, cause you leave the movie with little or no extra information.1) So these Engineers came to earth, hundreds of millions of years ago, and somehow seeded life. Okay fine. So how would ancient humans know about them, and why would they know their language and why did they leave? 2) Were are the female Engineers, or are there only muscular male Engineers? 3) Why did they try to destroy humans? Why would they need biological weapons to destroy primitive humans, when it would be easy to destroy them without powerful weapons? 4) Why would they leave humans a map to a planet where they create their weapons of mass destruction? 5)If the aliens have another home-world and aren't extinct, why would they not check on their important military base were they create weapons? 6) For what reason was the alien at the end in a hurry to destroy the earth after hibernating for 35000 years? 7) There are a million other why's. But here's the final one.8) Why would a rich man spend 1 trillion to get eternal life, when he could simply spend much less on a stasis chamber and sleep for a few centuries until humans could stop the aging process, why take a long shot on a dangerous journey half-way across the universe to talk to unknown aliens?",1,26,41,8 June 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Let them fight. BvS
","Batman vs Superman is a solid enough film. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Like many other fairer reviewers have said. It's not as bad as some critics are making it out to be. Critics were saying it is incoherent, and too long, they accused Lois Lane of not even having a big enough role in the film. A lot of the criticism was too harsh. For example, saying that the origin stories of batman is unnecessary is an unfair criticism as Batman's origin story almost only took 5 minutes at most of the runtime, with a few flashbacks that were well done in the beginning of the film. But I'm giving this film a 6 as opposed to a higher rating because I do agree when critics say there is too much happening. Aha, earlier I dismissed the claim that it is incoherent, it is coherent, I can follow the story, but there is too much of it. I enjoyed the first 2 thirds of the movie, had the movie stayed with the same feel and theme, then I would give it an 8. The movie starts to fall apart once they start introducing other members of the justice league, excluding Wonder woman, I felt as if she added value and should be introduced in this film, but the final third becomes this weird comic/cartoon thing. The fight against Doomsday was not as epic as Superman vs Zod, it did not feel real, it felt a bit like a cartoon. Anyways, yeah, to repeat. The film is solid enough, it had a strong start but became something weird in the final act. Which makes me scared of how their going to do the entire justice league on film using real actors. I hope the film makers don't even attempt to make a movie with Darkseid until they can make a movie with a constant theme and feel for the entire length of the film.",6,2,5,24 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Bravo J.J Abrams. A spectacular experience
","Wow, just wow. I went to this movie with highish expectations, the internet was abuzz about how this movie was going to be good. And I am pleased that this was one of the few times the buzz is justified, because this movie was a spectacular experience.JJ Abrams and Disney must take a bow on this one, this film has almost everything going for it. An incredible story line, modern special effects, great acting and chemistry between the cast members, nostalgia. Pretty much everything is in place.JJ certainly did fill this movie with a lot of content, a lot happens in about 2 hours or so, the movie is fast paced, it has to be to fill in everything from introducing the new characters to take the franchise forward, to also have the original characters handing over baton.I was incredibly impressed with the way The Force was presented in this film. The power of the force is displayed on screen. In previous films, other than in few places, the raw power of the force was not really shown, other than when Yoda lifted the fighter jet just by using it, but other than that in previous editions I found force use to be a bit underwhelming. JJ has Ken Rylo stop, I repeat stop a pulse laser mid-air instead of just deflecting it, so you have the laser beam buzzing mid-air. Really awesome.While the story line does resemble A New Hope, it's very much it's own thing, it's modern and fresh. Sleep easy folks, Star Wars is in good hands. I can't wait for the next installment.*****Warning Major Spoiler************I wanted to address the criticism of Rey beating Ken Rylo at the end. But I think there is a logical explanation for that. I haven't read the star wars comics or other books, everything I know about Star wars comes from the films. And from the film itself, looking at the character Ken Rylo. The film states that he has fears that he will never be strong as Darth Vadar. So the film might be implying that- that is the truth, while his powers are impressive, as displayed in the film, but we are in a time when there are very few Force Users, and at a time where there are many force users, during the prequels, he would be a below average Sith, and Rey is naturally a more powerful force user. That would also explain why Ken Rylo would turn to the dark side to increase his power because he knows he's not that strong, and he wants to be....Thats my two cents, anyways thats just a hypothesis.",10,23,62,16 December 2015
Alien: Covenant," I David
","First of all I loved the movie. But not because of the movie's own merit per say, I just love science fiction and I enjoy almost every science fiction movie I see. Really , other reviewers have raised valid criticisms about the film, about certain things that didn't make sense. So I will try to not rehash those in my list of questions/spoilers below.1. How did Elizabeth Shaw, a paleontologist and archaeologist know how to fix an android? One would suppose you would require an expert in robotics.2. Where did she find the equipment in the Engineer space ship to repair an android constructed with human technology.3. Are the engineers so trusting that you can just fly any space ship that can carry biological weapons and fly it over one of their cities? If you ask me they were just asking to be wiped out.4. After killing the engineers why did David than go and crash the space ship in some mountain outside the city?5. Despite the movies constant theme about how androids are immortal and humans are not, that statement is not true. We humans die because we break down, our body stops replacing the cells properly in time, and any machine also requires perpetual maintenance, so David is not really immortal, as long as he is being maintained he will continue to operate. Even so, one suspects at some point he would have to fill up his memory because he is finite, so perhaps in that case he could simply delete old files, but androids would hardly be gods. With that being said. How did David maintain himself in a strange planet with no spare parts for 10 years?6. Why did Elizabeth Shaw, not just fly home back to earth instead of going in search of the home planet of the aliens? Surely that is infinitely better than going to visit hostile alien species.7. Why did Weyland not build the 3 robotic laws into his androids as suggested by Isaac Asimov?8. Finally why did the crew members not wake up a few colonists as their numbers were dwindling to help out?I have a lot more questions, but this is a movie, I must suspend some disbelief to enjoy it.",8,24,45,19 May 2017
