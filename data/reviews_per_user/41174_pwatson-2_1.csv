Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Get over Quentin - This Film is Poor
","OK, the film is OK !! Please, all you little Film Critics out there, detach yourself from the fact that this is Tarantino, the fact that it is trying to be clever and you are left with a very average film.Why is everybody reading so deep into a film that parodies a genre that isn't very deep and be honest, Kung Fu Hong / Kong Movies are awful !! The 1st film is far better in script, plot and action...it's just clearly a better film.I can guarantee that, as with the likes of Titanic & Gangs of New York, this film is living off the hype and everybody can't see it for what it is....give it 5 years, and you'll all have put your note pads and film school pens away and will have forgotten about it.A very average and un-memorable piece of Film Making",Null,3,6,23 April 2004
