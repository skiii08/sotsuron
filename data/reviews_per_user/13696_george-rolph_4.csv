3:10 to Yuma," Sometimes the line between good and bad run close together.
","Nobody, from the director and writer, to the actors on the screen, put a foot wrong in this movie. Beautifully shot, with an unobtrusive music score and a deep and powerful story, this is one of the best and most intelligent movies I have seen this year.Crow and Bale are perfectly cast, whereas Bale and Cruise (originally wanted for the part of Ben Wade), would have been a disaster in my opinion. I can't look at Cruise on film without thinking of him jumping up and down on a couch like a performing monkey, so his image has been wrecked in my mind.OK. The story.Bale plays the part of a small time farmer (Dan Evans) caught up in circumstances that overwhelm him but give him a chance to rise above what fate has handed to him. It is a part that Bale plays to perfection. His role is that of the good guy trying to make a honest days living in a corrupt world full of greed. Opposite him is Crow. Rotten, vicious, ruthless, smart and very dangerous, because he is so smart. Yet, each are two sides of the same coin. Were past circumstances different for these men, it would be easy to believe that each of these two characters could have turned out like the other. It is this fascinating and deep idea that makes the story work so well.Watching the interplay between these two main characters is the farmers son (played superbly by Logan Lerman) William Evans and throughout, you get the feeling that whatever happens to his father will determine the way the boy develops. A fact that is as true today as it was in the time of the old west that this story is set in. Barely trying to conceal the contempt the boy feels for his father, he is drawn to the exciting world of thief and killer, Ben Wade (Crow). Though I long for the day when Hollywood will once again portray fathers as decent and hard working men, this movie does not sink to the level of dad bashing that so many other productions do. The boy has a boys understanding and no move is made to comment on it one way or the other. That is a mark of the excellence of the writing. The audience is given the honour of being smart enough to work that out. In Hollywood movies today, that is a rare honour indeed.Into Dan and Williams already hard life crashes Ben Wade and his gang of killers and robbers. Abandoned by his mother as a child and cynical to the point of the near psychopathic, Wade has no time for sentiment. Women are used and discarded. Men are useful if they do what he says, but no use if they do not. As head of his gang, Ben Wade is more a lion tamer than a leader of men and he knows it. He has trained them the way circus people train dangerous animals and they do his will right, or they don't make it. his manipulation skills are finely honed and he uses them well to figure out others and find their weak spots. Yet, despite all of these character flaws, his intelligence and respect for bravery in others manages to make him a likable villain.Almost hidden in the background of this story there is a thread running through it that intelligent viewers will pick up on and hopefully think about. That thread is the vital importance of family life and the need for all of us to make certain we allow space for parents to be able to make a good job of bringing up their kids. Raising children is too important a job to be left to governments and no matter how much they try to take over that role, they should be resisted. If not, what you see in this movie is what you get. Fathers must be cut some slack and mothers supported, not by government alone, but by all of us. We have to end the cynical, hate filled attitudes of many of our young, by teaching them that law abiding parents are good people and not weaklings. We also have to tell governments, in no uncertain terms, to take their grubby hands off of our kids and family life. Stop listening to Oprah, parenting books and tapes and start listening to granny and granddad is my advice.All in all this is a great movie and one that deserves to win Oscars all around. I doubt it will, but I hope I am wrong. Oscars these days tend to be tools of politics and those that are not go to movies that are full of sentimental slush. Rarely, it seems, do films like this get the recognition all deserve.The tension in this movie is wonderfully built up by the director and writer alike. At no point does it have one of those Hollywood moments of sheer idiocy, where one of the characters does something superhuman and instantly kills the believability of the story. No strange camera angles to ruin the flow and jar the mind and no screaming music to distract you from the action on screen. Just plain and simple good craft throughout, with superb supporting roles from the rest of the cast.I give this 9 out ten. Excellent work all round.",9,2,5,4 October 2007
Troy," Hissy Fits In Troy
","I have just been watching the movie Troy.Unable to control fits of uncontrollable laughter as the two main protagonists in the movie Hector and Achilles fought with girly boy fury in a swirl of long locks and within a cloud of Por Homme. The whole thing was a sorts of 'poofs4justice' movie that at times resembled a gay pride march. It must be a sign of the times. The speeches before battles were some of the finest comedy moments I have ever seen. At times resembling an army being 'inspired into battle' by dialogue that could have been written and delivered by Benny Hill. Never have I seen such terrible miscasting. The sort of acting that is fine in TV crap like Hercules but has no place on the big screen in something purporting to be an action movie. The money must have been good to attract so many big names but they did themselves no justice by allying themselves to this rubbish.I have heard a rumour that Johnathon Ross and his troop of 'Four Poofs And A Piano' are going to headline the cast in Troy Two (The Eyeliner Years) coming to a cinema soon.There is little doubt that this disaster of a movie should be confined to the dustbin of B movies along with 'Carry On Camping.'To quote the girly boy 'Prince of Troy' when faced with the Trojan Horse in a scene from the film, 'I think we should burn it.'George Rolph",1,1,10,21 February 2007
Quantum of Solace," Goodbye Mr Bond. We are neither shaken or stirred!
","James Bond is in dire danger. Not from Russians, nor from Koreans, or any other International group of terrorists. The threat to bond comes from International Socialism and their stupid political correctness that infests everything like a plague. Bond is now facing the same stupidity. It will surely not be long before Bond is transformed into an environment loving Hippy homosexual, or even, a feminist lesbian getting her own back on the male race.Groan! Leaving that aside, this has to be the worst Bond film in years because of an incompetent director, terrible writing and a rubbish editor. The opening sequence, so vital to all James Bond movies, was ruined by blazingly fast cutting that leaves the viewer fearing an epileptic attack, even if they are not epileptic. Your eye wants to look away because following the action is impossible. Your brain just cannot cope with the quick fire images and sounds and make sense of what is happening on the screen. By the time your head recovers you have to readjust your mind to try and follow the story again.Pretty soon you are introduced to the so-called villain. A two dimensional 'nasty' with a history of problems from his childhood.Oh Boy! Then we are treated to a dialogue between the villain and the leader of the rebel forces that reeks of socialist political thinking about corrupt business corporations. O.K. We get it! Capitalism is bad now get off the soap box please! This is followed by a boat chase sequence that looks like it should be in a computer game. The movie goes downhill from here.Bond has been a favourite for years because it focused on action and not second rate politics. It seems that all of that is changing and in the process it will kill Bond off. Maybe that is the idea? Forget this rubbish. It is nothing like Bond as Fleming made him. This is more like a left wing political activists idea of a character the rest of the world loves but they hate.Ho Hum. Welcome to tedium and goodbye Mr Bond.",1,15,24,20 February 2009
Stranger Than Fiction," Breathtakingly wonderful story well told.
","It is rare that one sits down to watch a movie and stands up again when it is finished, to find that your own creativity has been stirred into life and something else, something deep inside of you has been touched by what you have just experienced. Unless you are dead, or have been brought up believing that 'Rocky' movies, 'Friday the 13th' and 'Police Academy' represent the zenith of talent and wonderful story telling (in which case, you are all but dead)this movie will find that 'something' deep inside of you.A truly wonderful, compelling, and original story, beautifully told and wonderfully acted. Stranger than fiction is the antidote to all of the mindless pap pumped out by the slasher and stupid, pointless, fake 'comedy' machine of Hollywood. Somewhere within that monster in Beverly Hills people who are smart enough to recognise a wonderful story still exist. That fact should brighten all our days. 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,7 June 2007
