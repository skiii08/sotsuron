The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Definitely worth a watch
","There were times when i thought it would be a little cringy and clichÃ©d. This fear was *almost* entirely unwarranted. The lead actors delivered a convincing performance of some very interesting and multi dimensional characters. I engaged well with the story even though American high school movies aren't usually my cup of tea. Special credit to Emma Watson for shaking of Hemionie as she will probably always be remembered for harry potter. Even the coldest heart will feel a tear forming in some places although you have to watch the whole film to understand what i mean. It is no good watching it in small parts as it is very much a film which provokes a strong emotional response in the audience since everyone can identify with someone/something in the film over a slowly moving, but none the less compelling plot.",9,0,1,16 January 2017
