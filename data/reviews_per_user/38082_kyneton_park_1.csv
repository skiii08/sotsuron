First Man," Boring and oh so slow ... in 3 easy steps
","How can you make such a important and dramatic seres of events a bore. It turns out it's quite easy...here's how in 3 simple steps:1. Spend long lingering moments gazing in very close up shots at the two leads, that way you don't have to bother with any dialogue.2. Instead of bothering with special effects just jiggle the camera around inside what purports to be a tiny manned capsule, keep jiggling it and add some roaring noises and flashing lights, then keep jiggling it uncontrollably, then yes, that's rights, do it all over again ... and again. Whatever you do, don't look out the window or show any external shots. The side benefit is that jiggling a camera is a great way to save money.3. Use that old shakey handheld camera technique and keep shaking it around to pretend everything is authentic - if you like, you can add lots of out of focus shots because of course, that's how the human eye and our perception works doesn't it?This is an awful film, badly made and badly scripted. Worst thing is it is very uninformative. It is so boring you will want to leave half way through, but feel duty bound by the weighty, humourless, seriousness of it all to stay and see it through to the turgid end ..... do yourself a favour and don't bother.",Null,50,96,14 October 2018
