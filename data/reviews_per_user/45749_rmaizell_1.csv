The Lobster," Self Absorbed Crap
","The writer clearly has some issue to work through and sadly was allowed the resources to share this with an audience. If this is considered to be innovative cinema then the bar has been lowered to sub basement levels. This movie is not funny (as advertised), not clever, and not worth seeing. The acting was actually not dreadful given what the cast had to work with. I envision the author sitting at his desk trying to arrive at the most ridiculous premise possible, then constructing a script around it. Yes I get that this is an attempt to paint a dystopian view of societal relationships and expectations via exaggeration and juxtaposition. But why does the vehicle feel like a Road Runner cartoon with 20 ton Acme weights being dropped on the audience on a regular basis? If you want quality bizarre spend your cash on a Goddard movie.",1,46,77,20 June 2016
