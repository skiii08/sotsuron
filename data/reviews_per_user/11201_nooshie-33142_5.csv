Hereditary," I don't scare easily - this movie haunted me for weeks!!!
","This is one of the best horror movies I've seen for years. Now, I'm hard to please. I was brought up on horror classics of the 60s and 70s and I've seen it all. Hereditary is a throw back to the good old days of slow burn, psychological horror. It's scarily brilliant! The movie has the vibe of 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Shining' and 'The Exorcist'. It slowly builds the tension until it's almost unbearable and then gives a disturbing pay off that made all that tension worthwhile. Modern audiences may find this movie a bit slow. Yes, the pacing is leisurely but its pulling you in slowly and has an inextricable hold on you. The acting is first rate. Toni Collette is a revelation and the smallish cast all do a great job. The movie is first and foremost a dark family drama. Without the supernatural element it plays like a Scandi Noir angsty drama about grief and family dynamics. Throw in the supernatural element and it's like nothing I've seen for years. I have been waiting for a movie to truly scare me for years. 'The Conjuring' franchise has come the nearest and the spooky 'It Follows'. Hereditary stands head and shoulders above these movies. It haunted me for weeks and although I want to see it again, I'm not sure I should. The negative comments are mostly to do with pacing and it seems that a lot of viewers found the slow pace tedious. Its not your typical jump scare horror. It's much, much better than that!",9,4,6,7 July 2019
Us," Disappointing after the brilliant 'Get Out'!
","Jordan Peele was on my list of directors to watch after the brilliantly unsettling 'Get Out'. I looked forward to 'Us' as I like a horror movie and was expecting something a bit special. I was very disappointed with this daft and unscary body snatchers movie. The premise is just too silly for words. We each have a doppelganger tied to us mentally and physically by some unexplained scientific means. The clones are kept in underground bunkers and fed a diet of rabbits, until they rebel and start wanting to live above ground. Obviously this is a recipe for disaster. Cue clones in red boiler suits terrorising their above ground counterparts. They have a thing for long pairs of scissors. For a movie that purports to be horror, there is little tension, few scares and not a lot of horror. One of the clones speaks like someone with really bad laryngitis and another runs about on all fours and barks! The protagonists are just not monstrous enough to be scary and the plot is nonsensical, sci-fi twaddle. The cast are pretty bland too. No-one seems that bothered and the acting has a 'going through the motions' feel. The kids convince more than the adults and actors of the calibre of Elizabeth Moss, are just plain wasted. Even the twist ending was dumb and obvious. Desperately mediocre.",4,1,1,22 June 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Stunning homage to 60s Tinseltown
","I was 14 in 1969. I can remember watching 'Lancer' on tv and having a huge crush on James Stacy (played perfectly by Timothy Oliphant), so this magical homage to 1960s film and tv was not only very nostalgic but also entertaining, amusing and thought provoking. What would have happened if the Manson murderers had gone to another house on Cielo Drive to be slaughtered themselves by a stunt man (and dog )and a faded tv cowboy? That's the showdown this leisurely and stunningly filmed and acted movie graciously leads you to. Pitt and DiCaprio have never been better, Pitt stealing the show with his laconic, laid back stunt man, the sounding board, best friend and drinking buddy of a washed up tv actor, played charmingly and disarmingly by DiCaprio. Every shot looks wonderful, 1969 comes to life in technicolour splendour and by the end of this movie, you're in love with the leads. Tarantino's best movie since 'Pulp Fiction'. Praise to Margot Robbie as a luminous Sharon Tate and all the ensemble cast. Best movie of the year and a must see even if you weren't around in the 60s!",9,3,4,14 December 2019
Parasite," Am I missing something?
","I was so looking forward to Parasite. What a disappointment. Is this the movie that has won all these awards and put Korea on the map? I sat through it waiting for something to spark my interest, anything that would raise this oriental potboiler social comedy of manners into high art. It failed to materialise. The acting is cartoony (perhaps it's supposed to be), the plot downright silly although I would say it had some originality and overall it just seemed pretty poor. It was neither satirically funny enough or dramatic enough to be a stunning black comedy. Far too aware of itself. I did want to like this. I was anticipating another 'Roma' but all I got was a frantic mess.",5,4,7,15 March 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Great kids - not so sure about the adults!
","I was really looking forward to this movie but was a tad disappointed when I finally got to see it. I think comedy drama is a difficult genre anyway and this movie uneasily traversed the two. I think it should have been a straight out satirical comedy. The pathos when it came, just didn't sit well with the surreal lunacy of the plot. The child actors are wonderful and all of them give honest and believable performances which is an accolade given the script and what they were expected to do. The adult actors not so much. Scarlett Johansson was particularly annoying as Jojo's resistance agent mother. She didn't feel real as a character. Neither did most of the adults in this movie. I know it's a satire but some of the performances were just too cartoon like to evoke any real emotion. I did find Rebel Wilson's performance amusing but that was about it. All in all, a strange concoction which was neither witty or satirical enough to really lampoon the Third Reich and neither dramatic or heartfelt enough to portray a Germany coming to the end of its quest for World domination. I so much wanted to like this but I found it underwhelming and if I want to watch Nazis being made fun of, I prefer 'Allo Allo' (British sitcom set in occupied France)!",7,1,4,9 February 2020
