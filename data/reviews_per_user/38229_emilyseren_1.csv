Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," The Best Film of 2011
","I shall not give away anything, except the fact that it was the best film of 2011.With laugh out loud moments, welling up moments and 'edge of your seat moments', Guy Ritchie has made one of the best films i have ever seen, a brilliant sequel to the first one, if you watched the first one (and even if you didn't!) you should go and see this film. It has brilliant CGI effects and excellent actors. Robert Downey JR and Jude Law make an excellent partnership, and i think that they are friends even off the screen, as showed on the Graham Norton Show the other week. Elementary, my dear friend.",10,5,10,20 December 2011
