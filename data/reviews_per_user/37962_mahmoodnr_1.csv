It," Boring, funny and few scary jump scenes
","The movie didn't attract me from the beginning and it wasn't really scary, it was more of a comedy horror movie, however, I loved Bill Skarsg√•rd he did his part really well it was flawless and loved the unique character each kid has especially Finn Wolfhard with his comedic character and I wanted to watch more scenes of him.It looked like there's a possibility for a chapter 2 movie but I wouldn't recommend it for my friends.",5,13,42,6 September 2017
