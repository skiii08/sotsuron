The Equalizer," Obama against Russia?
","This movie probably invested by USA Government! Hahahaha, Obama killing Russian oligarchs by his hand drill against machine guns and killing them, and taking their tonnes of money of their storage! and finally killed Putin! what a poor story and never seen like this stupid movie with 7.4 ratings and also from Denzin Washington, don't understand why people giving 10 on this piece of ###, the story is unclear, who is that professional man, and howecome one person doing karate against fully armored professional killers, and showing that USA cops are too stupid and nothing can do, and Obama is too old for that fast movement against youngsters, it is like Superman, wanted to proof how USA black man strong for the Russians, very unsatisfied and wasted whole 2 hours like this stupid movie ... this rating is just overrated!",3,9,17,16 December 2014
Pacific Rim," Best Action movie in 2013 so far ...
","Absolutely best action movie so far this year, there is something different from other boring, same old story movies like Transformers, Iron Man 3 franchises. Not so good story and not so meaningful that where the alien came from and the actions taken from human, world and how they are fighting them but start up, action scenario, no boring drama made movie something different and very excited, that team play and showed whole world, human, technology power you probably accept that best movie so far human against alien, second biggest monster movie as i remember after Godzilla and soundtrack in every scenario matched so. After all hadn't time to think about root cause and other things watching the movie for 2 hours :P",9,14,22,4 August 2013
