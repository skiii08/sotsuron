The Avengers," Amazing
","This movie revolutionized the way we imagine comic book movies, DC have a big competition! Although the second one was better this movie this was the original, which in a way means this is better. The villain in this film is of course Loki who was played by Tom Hiddleston who was outstanding, but talking of amazing performances Rdj was as usual a perfect iron-man. The directing of Joss Whedon was ...well there are no words he is a virtual God walking among mere mortals. To sum up great movie, great acting and great directing it's definitely no wonder how it grossed to over 1.5billion!
