The Blair Witch Project," Quick Reviews!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!The wild hysteria surrounding this movie proves that the majority of the cinema going audience can still be fooled into believing anything they see or hear, or think they do, but that doesn't change the fact that it is an extremely convincing and effective horror flick. A certain number of people on these boards, and who have reviewed B. Witch Project HATE the film for varying, understandable reasons. When i first watched this, i watched intently, knowing exactly what the directors were playing at, and i found great enjoyment in watching the reactions of those who thought it was real. Did it unsettle me? No. Did it make me jump like the horror movies that rely on loud noises to scare (the Ring Remake) ? No. But it was the first horror movie in a very long time to put a smile on my face, and make me shiver. If you can remember back to when you played hide and seek as a kid- the feeling you had when the person looking for you was 10 feet away and coming closer- that is what this film gives, in a much greater quantity.It is slow moving, and if you do not enjoy the pace, then you may not enjoy the film, but it compensates this by being short and concise, juxtaposed against how the 3 campers must have felt as the hours dragged by- the point i take from this is that in life we only remember a series of memories, images pasted together to make little sense, and life seems much shorter than it actually was.The camera use and grainy feel again may be fuel for hatred or love, but it works perfectly- they don't know what is going on, and neither do we, but that doesn't matter because in an uncertain and threatening situation, the natural human reaction is to run or fight. Drained, exhausted, paranoid, they run. Ever had a nightmare about running away from something, but not knowing exactly what it was, or why you are running?The best part of the movie (apart from the hilarious 'i kicked the map into the river' scene) is the last few minutes when Michael and Heather enter the house following Josh's screams. I get the 'shivering' feeling throughout this (probably 'spine tingling' or 'chilling' is the 'correct term'), especially when Heather screams, and the ending is excellent as our feelings and fear somehow builds and climaxes (apologies for the sexual connotations) in perfect harmony with what is happening on screen. The actors are clearly convincing, again look at the hysteria for proof, and although they are not called upon to do much, they do it well. Oh yeah, the only scene i do not like is the 'Heather snot' scene- it is too long and breaks up the momentum. Few great horror films come along these days, this is one- embrace it, let yourself be sucked in to feel the full effect, don't be critical, and realize how good it is. 9 out of 10",Null,0,2,30 November 2004
Vertigo," quick reviews!
","yes, quick, as others reviewers have gone into greater depth, and i can't add anything new.Oh baby, what a film! 1958!!! This has plot twists, even effects that put movies of today to shame. One of the most complex films ever made, with something new arising with each viewing, I think this, along with The Seven Samurai, is the best movie of all time. The first time I watched it, I had no idea how it would end, and what would become of Scotty and Madeleine. My only qualm is the fact that Midge completely disappears from the movie in the second half. Why?! It's not important though. Superbly shot, and immaculately directed, as always. 10 out of 10",10,87,161,23 May 2004
Alien 3," Quick reviews!!
","The third entry in the Alien series is famous more for its script re-writes, disputes and problems rather than anything that happens in the movie, and has since been slated by fans and critics who expected much more. On the DVD we can see all these problems, the ideas that were thrown out, and how different the film could have been. Eventually Fincher got the director's job and did everything he could to make it good, all the while looking over his shoulders as ravenous producers repeatedly stepped in to make changes. What is left is a disappointment from one perspective, but a thoroughly good movie from another. Hicks and Newt, surviving characters from Aliens are killed off, rendering their escape pointless, and setting the gloomy tone for the movie. Bishop is destroyed and has no wish of being remade as a second grade model. After the excitement of the previous film, here we have one alien, and lots of talking. In this way it disappoints. However, watching it as the story of Ripley, of her never-ending nightmare, of a triumph of lighting, atmosphere and darkness, it works well. The tunnel chase scene is also one of the best movie moments of the decade. Therefore it is nowhere near as bad as many say it is, but it had the potential of being much better.Ripley's escape pod crashes on a prison planet, Fury 101. She is the only survivor, human survivor, and is brought into the prison causing much disruption. The inmates are all men, most murderers and rapists, sentenced to life, but they have adopted religion to get them through each day. There is no way off the planet, no weapons, and it seems a certain creature is loose. The Corporation hears of her survival and prepares to come 'rescue' her, but Ripley is more worried about survival as the Alien begins to pick off the inmates. However, a twist reveals that the Alien will let her live.Weaver is again very good, as are the rest of the cast, particularly Charles S. Dutton and the late Brian Glover. Unfortunately the rest of the cast all look identical, and most are killed without emotion. The score is good, the sets are impressive, and everything is dark and shadowy. The alien itself has changed, but the CG is poor. Many complained the film is too depressing, and if you like your films bright and with a happy ending then this is not for you. For fans of the series, most are split over its merits. I only really enjoyed it after a few watches.7.5 out of 10",7,3,4,6 April 2005
The Ring," Quick Reviews!!
","One of the worst remakes of recent years, made worse because it should have been so much better. Wooden acting from most-unlike the original, the intro was far to teen movie like-unlike the original, terrible attempts at scaring-unlike the original, and a weak ending-unlike the original. You've probably guessed i'm a big fan of the original, yes, i consider it to be the best horror movie of the nineties, since Elm Street part one, but do not let you think that means i am biased- I had high hopes for this, which were quashed, but I have high hopes for the sequel. I also loved The Grudge remake and felt it was almost as good as the original.Although this tried to be clever, and gets points for attempting to create some atmosphere, it just falls on its face, reverting to very weak and predictable jumpy moments. Lesson 1- Loud noises may make the audience jump, but they will not be SCARED- in the cinema they have BIG speakers so the sound of a car driving may be enough to make us jump. Is this scary? No. The Ring relies far too much on this- horses kicking walls etc. Eg, you're walking around your house thinking about something. Someone bumps into you when you don't expect it- you are momentarily shocked, but soon forget it. This is not scary. However, if you are walking around you're house with the belief that someone or something is outside, or perhaps inside intending to get you, that is fear. You are scared. Ringu did this for 90 minutes or so, The Ring does it for 0. Naomi Watts is a good actress, and Verbinski is an OK director, but they do not seem comfortable here. He may not have been able to direct her effectively. The rest of the cast is instantly forgettable. The kid, Yoichi equivalent was good in Panic, but here is just another '6th Sense Look Out Scary Kid Alert' kid. Yoichi in the original said little, but he was not the focus, and he still managed to make us uncomfortable. The score in the original is extremely effective and haunting, this has nothing. The story is minimal admittedly, but the original covered this and dealt with what there was with great skill. Here it tries to cover it up by bringing in some nonsense horse side plot which has little relevance and is entirely dumb. And the ending. The original Sadako moment is one of the most frightening things ever filmed, you will feel your whole body become tense the first time you see it, edited perfectly and filmed so excruciatingly slowly that you may almost not be able to bear it. In this it is laughable, far too fast, (again with the loud noises) and we actually cut away from it! We cut away from it!! This takes whatever tension there may have been away from the scene, and then we are set up for another predictable 'jump' moment when the seat is turned round and...! How many times has that ploy been used in movies? Samara herself is not scary, just seems like an annoying little girl. Sadako however is pure rage, unstoppable, and very creepy. Let's hope that Nakata can do something better with the sequel.4 out of 10",4,2,5,7 March 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Quick Reviews!!
","One of the most exhilarating movies of all time in the vein of North By Northwest and Bond movies. We are introduced to Indiana Jones, part time lecturer, explorer, archaeologist, and ladies' man...The film sees Jones on a race to find the famous Ark of the Covenant before the Nazi's do. The film races across the globe via many excellent set pieces as Jones takes on various bad guys, booby traps and carnivorous animals. On the way he picks up an ex 'girlfriend' who comes along for the journey, and several old friends. When the site of the Covenant is found, Jones realises he and the Nazi's may have got more than they bargained for.Featuring some of the most famous scenes in movie history- the boulder scene, and the opening of the arc being two. Every performance is worthy of respect, with Ford ensuring Jones became one of Cinema's most loved heroes. Allen is excellent in a strong role, as are the various bad guys. The effects are still good, but it is the stunts and action juxtaposed with moments of humour which mark the film as a true classic. Everything moves frantically, and Indy usually only scrapes out narrowly of the situations he finds himself him. And the score is one of the most memorable and rousing ever.",10,0,1,14 December 2004
Lifeboat," Quick Reviews!!
","Lifeboat is an early experimental film by Hitchcock, the film mainly taking place in the limited confines of a lifeboat. A US ship has been bombed, and a number of survivors reach a lifeboat. Connie Porter is a self-interested, strong-willed reporter, Kovac is anti-Nazi, and each of the other characters have their own problems and opinions. When a young mother kills herself after her baby dies, the crew become closer and try to find a way out of their situation, deciding to sail for Bermuda even though their compass is broken. When a German joins the boat they argue over what to do, some don't trust him, others say they cannot just throw him out. The German says he knows which way Bermuda is and the others follow his course. He has another agenda though, appearing to lead them to a Nazi supply ship, keeping the water and food pills for himself. However, when he lets one of the group die they turn against him in typically brutal fashion. However, was he genuinely trying to help them? And how will the group escape now?The film is of course character driven, but unfortunately many of the characters are not interesting and no matter what happens they seem passive and unemotional. Perhaps this was on purpose because of the starvation and dehydration, perhaps because the performances of some are average. Each actor does well, but none stand out and the tension created is small until the last 15 minutes or so. However, the film is still watchable and we do want to see if they will escape or not, and what they will do to Willy, the German Captain who sunk their ship. It is true that Hitchcock would hone these elements in later films such as Rear Window and Rope. It is interesting because we would ask ourselves what we would do in such a situation, perhaps being exposed to our enemies or those we do not trust.7 out of 10",7,4,14,12 April 2005
Wayne's World," Quick Reviews!!
","One of my all-time favourite comedy's, and one of those films that, when i was younger, i would continually watch. Funny and charming, i'd rather have one of these than a million American Pie clones. Being a rock and Beavis and Butthead fan from an early age, this seemed like essential viewing. Yeah, it may be stupid, and give the idea that rock music and fans lack intelligence, but it is a comedy and would hardly be funny if Wayne and Garth were geniuses. Wayne has a TV show on cable where he and his best friend Garth mess about, play guitar, take about music and women etc. Wayne has recently split from his odd girlfriend who keeps stalking him, and their lives seem to be going nowhere. A local TV station decides to let their show air professionally, and they agree. Meanwhile, Wayne has fallen for a singer called Cassandra. The TV guys try to change the show, and when Wayne rebels, he is fired. Garth falls out with him, and sleaze guy Benjamin moves in on Cassandra, whose band are gaining recognition. Wayne must try to win pack his friend and girlfriend, while trying to secure his show.There are many movie in-jokes here, many music references and sight gags, most of which i find funny, but many others will not. The dialogue has since become cheesy, but that was always the desired effect, and the two lead performances are very good. Garth will have you laughing just by looking at him, while Myers is clearly a smart comedian. The rest of the cast are good, Lowe moving away from his Brat pack days, and Carrera gives a better performance than many would expect. The smaller characters provide many laughs, ('why do they come to me to die?') and we will be rooting for Wayne as the film approaches its conclusions. Better than any of the Austin Powers films, though less successful, Wayne's World is simply a funny, light-hearted film which tries to give you the belief that you can overcome any obstacle and still get the girl.9 out of 10",9,0,2,18 February 2005
Unbreakable," Quick Reviews!!
","The follow-up to The Sixth Sense is a much superior film, smarter and more stylish, a mix of thriller, mystery and comic book which sees S.L Jackson and Bruce Willis teaming up once again. Willis is again distancing himself from his action movie persona by making films like these, proving he is a very capable actor. Here he plays David Dunn, the lone survivor of a train crash, with a history of near-perfect health. He meets Elijiah, a man who kids call Mr Glass because of his crippling brittle bone syndrome, and with a love of comics. Elijiah takes an interest in David, and at first seems like a stalker. He wants to prove that David is almost like a superhero as he believes David is impervious to physical harm. He convinces David's son and tries repeatedly to convince David, who claims he has been both sick and injured, and is just a normal man who got lucky. However, David eventually realises others, and at the request of Elijiah, uses his powers to help the weak and defenceless.While the Sixth Sense was predictable, though tried to be atmospheric, and successfully convinced many people, Unbreakable is more subtle and works on many levels, but was a much smaller hit. Shyamalan's style is present here, with floating cameras and contrasts in lighting, built around a twisting plot. Jackson and Willis are equally impressive, and the rest of the cast are good, mainly Robin Penn and Spencer Clark. A highly interesting film worth several watches, and an original take on the typical Comic Book movie.8 out of 10",8,6,10,8 March 2005
Akira," Quick reviews!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!I have no doubt that the first time most westerners watch this they will feel confused afterwards. I'm pretty sure that the first time they see it they will think the animation was very good. Maybe some will know they have just seen something special. Akira is probably the most famous Japanese animated movie, manga or anime, and is surely the most influential. it may not be an exaggeration to say it is one of the most influential movies of any kind ever, as many films, animated and not, have taken elements directly from it.I won't try to summarise the plot, i'm not sure if i can make it sound comprehensible, but it involves biker gangs, friendship, overpowering technology, and the apocalypse. The plot is confusing, especially for western audiences who had simply not experienced anything quite like this before, and the frantic pace and quick direction only make everything seem more chaotic (as if that wasn't the point to some degree), but the more you watch it, the more you will see this is not a flaw. The animation is some of the best ever seen, the picture it gives of Neo-Tokyo is stunning, and the last half hour is mind-blowing. Some parts are very touching too, as we watch Tesuo's struggle, and the multitude of themes are well worth thinking about when you can't sleep or are drunk, stoned, whatever.. 8 out of 10",9,4,7,17 November 2004
Kickboxer," Quick Reviews!!
","Probably the most famous of Van Damme's early work, kick-boxer is another simple story of revenge, and a showcase for his skills as a martial artist. It has some good fights, and some interesting moments showing the difficulty of training and trying to achieve your best while not losing your focus. Although it suffers from some cheesy acting, dialogue, music, and a highly disturbing dance scene, this is a must for Van Damme fans, and those with an interest in martial arts movies who don't want to stray too far from the West.Van Damme stars as Kurt Sloane, the younger brother of a flashy American Kickboxer. They train together, but his brother Eric seems to be more interested in looking like a good fighter than actually finding the ability and skill to be one. Eric takes part in a fighting competition and is crippled and almost killed by Tong Po, and fearsome Kickboxer with a great rage and discipline. Kurt decides to avenge his brother, but no-one will train him as they believe Tong Po is too popular and strong. Eventually he finds a trainer in the middle of nowhere who teaches him to reach his full potential and push through the barriers which he never though he could surpass. He also meets Winston Tyler who provides some laughs, and Mylee who provides some style. Of course it is the fights that matter, and the revenge plot is safe enough to give the fights reason. Rather than cheap montages, we see the tough training regime Kurt goes through, and see Tong Po kicking a cement wall to build up the strength and invulnerability of his foot. Sounds odd yes, but how else would we know he's a hard lad? Anyway, a good film for fight fans, light-hearted and fast and worth watching.7.5 out of 10",7,8,9,5 May 2005
Dawn of the Dead," Quick Reviews!!
","Being a zombie movie fan, i have much enjoyed the recent (continuing) resurgence of the genre. As i believe that Romero's Dawn is not only the best zombie movie ever, but one of the best horror movies, i was both excited and sceptical to hear about a remake. Reasons for excitement- 1. It's zombies. 2. A big budget. 3. If done right, could be brilliant. Reasons for scepticism- 1. A big budget. 2. Less gore, less shock value. 3. If done wrong could be awful, and possibly tarnish the name of the original in some people's eyes.I soon heard that the zombies would be able to run- a source of many arguments among fans and purists. On one side, the zombies were scarier because their slow speed was irrelevant, they would probably get you in the end through sheer numbers or by the fact that they don't get tired. Slow zombies were scary because they were falling to pieces. However, on the other side, people who have recently turned may still be in good shape so should be able to run until they begin to decay. Fast zombies make the threat more immediate and therefore give rise to more jumpy moments. Fast zombies mean we have an even smaller chance of survival as we may not be able to outrun them. Some have said the zombies in this are 'super-fast', but this is nonsense. A zombie should only be as fast as it was before it turned, more likely slower, but will not get out of breath. All this running will however mean quicker decay. What it all boils down too in the end is whether you can make your choice effective, and in both films, both directors succeed.A Nurse, Ana, during and after a heavy shift fails to notice the news reports that the dead are attacking the living. It is probably rubbish anyway, and she just wants to get home to suburbia. The next morning, her young neighbour enters her bedroom; She seems to be hurt. When her husband investigates, she attacks him, biting off part of his throat. He dies, the phone is engaged, but he quickly rises again and goes for his wife. When she escapes the house she witnesses chaos, people screaming, houses on fire and being attacked, her neighbour with a gun, promptly run over by an ambulance. She escapes in her car only to crash after seeing the scale of the madness. Soon she meets with a cop- Kenneth, Michael, Andre and his pregnant girlfriend Luda. They decide to hide in a local mall only to find that Store guards have claimed it for their own. However, they work out a compromise and soon other survivors join them. As the days pass, they try to work out a solution, how to maintain their safety and sanity. When an attempt to send food to Andy, a survivor on the roof of a gun shop a few hundred yards away goes wrong, the zombies get into the mall, and the remaining survivors flee. Their plan to escape to an island by boat seems good, but it is based on pure hope, and the desire to get out of their present situation, rushed, and the hordes continue to chase.The film lacks the brains and atmosphere of Romero's masterpiece. But it makes up for this by giving an excellent view of how contemporary people would likely react to the situation. The film begins quickly, and to the director's credit, the pace continues throughout. Anytime something good happens, something worse happens to bring the characters to an even lower state. It is frantic, but never out of control, and their is a fair amount of tension. Once we realise the zombies are fast, we are on edge, prepared for one or one hundred to come racing round the nearest shadowy corner. The actors all do well, particularly Polley and the excellent Weber. His character is just a normal guy, a failure at many things, but who will not give up. Rhames is tough, but doesn't set out on his own, knowing that he is needed. The soundtrack is more conventional,with booming rock songs being played over each attack, but this heightens the chaos. There is little hope left at the end, and little time for discussion over why this has happened. There are a few good set pieces, and the gore is good for a modern mainstream film. There are a few funny moments, and of course, another staple of zombie films, an annoying character-Steve. The best of the recent serious zombie films by a wide margin, lets see if Romero can regain his crown.8 out of 10",8,0,0,3 March 2005
Alien: Resurrection," Quick Reviews!!
","The final entry in the series, so far, and perhaps one entry too far considering Ripley's nightmare was finally ended in Alien 3. However, as is the case with nightmares, they always find a way back. Being 1997, DNA and cloning was all the rage so the guys in charge decided to bring Ripley back using advanced cloning techniques 200 years after her death. With Jeunet directing, one of the most original upcoming directors, and Joss Whedon with the script this had potential, and all thoughts were of taking the series back to an action style. Get together a talented cast and this should have been much better. Though for some reason it simply does not live up to the hype.Those evil scientists have been chasing the alien Ripley encountered for centuries now, and finally after many failed attempts they managed to clone Ripley with the Alien DNA inside her. Using this they created a number of Aliens for observation, but Ripley has also become a cross-breed with all the strengths of both species. Meanwhile a cargo ship has landed on the floating base where these experiments are being made, and soon the aliens have found a way to escape. Most employees try to flee, leaving the cargo crew and Ripley to fend off the aliens. Though it is uncertain which side Ripley is on. As they try to escape The Queen gives birth to a new breed of Alien, more deadly than all the rest. Their ship is drifting towards Earth, and if the creature makes it there, humanity could be over.The inclusion of quality actors such as Ryder, Perlman and Wincott add to the film's strengths, but the whole thing seems hollow, lacking both the excitement of Aliens and the scares of Alien. There are twists, lots of gore, some good effects and ideas, but perhaps it tries to be too clever for one movie. Mostly the performances are good, though most of the characters are not given a chance to grow or get our sympathy. Weaver is again good as the new Ripley, but one of the main good points of the other entries was that she was human, mortal, weak but when in danger would fight. Now we cannot relate to her and none of the other characters really draw our attention as they are all cold and hardened smugglers. Only Ryder gets some emotional value, but then again she has a twist in store for the viewer. It seems to be a film which tries to blend all of the past films into one, and therefore does not excel in any one place. The visuals are very good, as are the sets etc, but with this series we have come to want excellence.7 out of 10",7,1,2,13 April 2005
Beauty and the Beast," Quick Reviews!
","My favourite Disney film, made in the last great era of the company, before the new wave of technologically advanced films came along. This era included Aladdin and the Lion King, but it is Beauty and the Beast which comes out on top for its simple story, beautifully told. Based on the classic French fairy tale the story is one of love, understanding, and seeing the true nature of a person, not what is on the surface, and the wonderful characters along with sumptuous animation and timeless songs make this a deserving classic.Belle lives with her old father Maurice, and her horse, just outside a quiet country town. She is shy, would do anything for her father, an inventor, but is lonely, wishing that there is something more than the world she sees everyday. Local hard-man Gaston wants to marry her, but she is not interested. One day Maurice gets lost in a massive forest, and finds shelter in an old castle. There he finds magical creatures, cups and ornaments who can speak. However the castle is owned by a monster who captures Maurice. The beast will only save Maurice if Belle will go to him forever, and Belle sacrifices herself. At first the beast is frightening, but with time they grow to understand each other, eventually falling in love. The beast's curse is that he must have a woman fall in love with him before his magical rose dies, or he will be trapped in that body forever. Years ago he was cursed for not helping an old woman and has become bitter, but Belle changes that. However, Gaston has plans of his own. The film is full of beautiful imagery which will stay with you forever-the rose petals falling, the ballroom dance, and the swooping camera adds a new dimension to the musical score. Seasons change from summer to winter and the animators eye for detail with each change is truly breathtaking. Smaller characters like Chip, Lumiere, Mrs Potts and the clock add to the delightful mood. Only a heart of stone could dislike this movie, and the story is sincere and touching, if a little whimsical. Each song is charming and memorable, and the Oscar is well deserved. Short enough to keep any kid occupied, but older viewers can equally enjoy the romance which is more effectively shown here than in the majority of non-animated features. Watch this and the world doesn't seem so bad. 10 out of 10",10,5,5,8 February 2005
Spider-Man 2," Quick Reviews!!
","After the hype surrounding the average Spiderman, I was looking forward to this because it introduced Doc Oc, one of my favourite comic book bad guys, but I wasn't expecting it to be vastly better than the first. I was proved wrong, this improves over part 1 in every way, the performances are stronger, the effects are better, it is far more exciting and there is a less teeny feel about it. Not quite as good as the X-men movies, but better than most other recent comic book movies.Peter Parker has been masquerading as Spiderman for some time, helping the city from crime, but he still has his critics. More importantly though he is trying to get on with a normal life, earning money and thinking about MJ. However, after the events of the first film, the three people Peter cares for most are becoming distant from him in different ways. MJ has fallen for someone else, the astronaut son of Jameson and Peter keeps letting her down. Also, his best friend Harry, whose father (Green Goblin) was killed by Spiderman is closing in on his discovery and is becoming increasingly hate filled and paranoid. Aunt May is also getting older and becomes estranged from her nephew when she realises what Peter did in the first film. As well as this, Peter seems to be losing his powers. He decides that he must give up Spiderman. After meeting Doctor Octavius, an experiment goes wrong simultaneously destroying the Osbourne company and turning the Doc into Doc Oc. Doc Oc goes on a crime spree, and begins to put New York in danger, particularly Peter's closest friends. He must be stopped at all costs, so Spiderman is reborn.Firstly the writers and Raimi deal with the many intertwining plot lines brilliantly, squeezing everything into the two hours, and leaving space for tonnes of action. Fans of the comic will enjoy seeing the appearance of later important characters such as John Jameson and Doc Connors. Each storyline is followed carefully and we feel sympathy towards Parker whose gift is becoming a curse. However, as this is primarily marketed as a summer blockbuster it is the stunts, action and effects which will matter to the masses. And they are excellent. The fights between Spiderman and Doc Oc are some of the most impressive action sequences to date, especially when the pair are flying through the city at break-neck speeds. Once the action starts, the excitement rarely fades, juxtaposed by the impending threat of peter being uncovered, and Harry finding out the truth. The film also sets itself wonderfully for sequels and spin-offs, as fans will know about the appearance of Venom, Doc Connors and the Hobgoblin. Maguire performs much better here than in the first, and his character's depth certainly increases. Dunst is also much better, possibly her best performance since Interview with a Vampire, and Molina is perfect as Doc Oc. Franco as Harry also admirably shows range as he struggles between sanity and madness, and although he seems to be losing he still is capable of getting sympathy from us. Overall an excellent comic conversion, and more like what the first should have been-great, clever entertainment.8 out of 10",8,1,2,6 April 2005
The Fifth Element," Quick Reviews!!
","Luc Besson shows again why he was one of the most stylish and innovative directors of the nineties with this effort. Bringing together a wildly varied cast, from action stars to stage actors to supermodels to cult heroes, and putting them in a genre defying film about the salvation of earth in the future, he gives one of the most visually impressive films of the era, as well as one of the most entertaining.The story begins in the early 20th century with an archaeologist and friend uncovering proof of aliens, and of a mysterious fifth element, the only thing capable of saving the world from destruction. Aliens arrive and take the apparent device, leaving Luke Perry to pass on the secret through the generations. Flash forward a few centuries and we meet a group of scientists who have found the Fifth Element. It is a beautiful young woman, and half the galaxy is after her, including evil aliens, and the tyrannical Gary Oldman. The young woman escapes, only to literally crash into washed up taxi driver and ex soldier Bruce Willis. She speaks in an alien language, but together they find Ian Holm, a descendant of the original archaeologist. Thus begins a frantic race to save the world from an approaching black ball of shadow, while protecting the fifth element from capture.The film has much to give- the sets, effects, and costumes are all wonderful, giving one of the best visions of the future since Blade Runner, and borrowing many ideas from such sci-fi classics. There are brilliant performances from all, though Oldman, Johovich, and Tucker stand out. The film is bursting with ideas and imagination, there are many funny moments, and the message that love can conquer all, though slightly glossy, is still relevant. At times bizarre, but always highly watchable, the Fifth Element is a film which everyone with a heart and soul should enjoy, or at least find something worthwhile in it. 9 out of 10.",9,6,11,11 January 2005
Blade," Quick Reviews!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!One of the best comic to film conversions, dark, funny, gory and action packed. We are introduced to Blade, a half man, half vampire with a tragic past who has made it his lonely quest to kill all vampires. His advantage over them is that he has their strength, speed and heightened senses, and can expose himself to sunlight without fear of burning up. His disadvantage is his need to feed-blood is necessary for him, but is not in ready supply as he will not drink from a human. The film deals with Blade noticing that vampire activity has increased, that gangs are coming together under lead vampire Frost who plans to become all-powerful. It is only a matter of time before this happens, and the human race, oblivious, is doomed.The action in Blade is superb, with Snipes showing off his martial arts skills, and managing to look kick ass cool as he does it, and the effects are brilliantly bloody. The opening scene in the vampire club is one to be remembered for the ages, and many of the fight scenes are equal to the best Hong kong has ever produced. Kristofferson is good as Blade's only friend, Wright is OK as the woman half way to vampirism, and Dorff is excellent as Frost. The film scores points for being down beat, not striving to be like anything that has come before, or trying to fit conventions, and by doing this it raises itself above the majority of modern horror, action, and comic movies. 9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,30 November 2004

","Easily the best Christmas movie for kids growing up in the eighties and nineties, and deserves to be mentioned along side the classics from previous decades. For kids, the movie has everything- action, excitement, humour, and for everyone else the story and acting are engaging. The idea of being left Home Alone for a while, especially after your relatives have been so annoying, will appeal to kids as they will have peace to do anything they want and let their imaginations fly. Cue lots of ice cream and sled rides down stairs. The film shows depth by letting us see the initial down side to being alone- the house can be scary when it gets dark, and you know your parents are not there to help. The plot sees the massive Macallister (spelling?) family planning to go on holiday for Christmas. After a pizza incident at the dinner table, young Kevin is sent to bed and locked in. The next morning there is a rush, and the family leave for the airport without Kevin, only realising what has happened when they are on the plane. They try to find a way home, but this is not easy as it's Chritmas. Meanwhile, two crooks plan to rob the Macallister house, knowing it's empty, but soon realise that Kevin is inside. Kevin sees that it is up to him to protect his house, and begins setting up traps for the intruders. What follows is great entertainment. Yes it may be soppy, but it is a family Christmas film. It is much smarter than you may think, probably accounting for much of its great success, and the acting, particularly from Culkin and Pesci, is impressive. The set pieces are ingenious, ensuring that every 10 year old boy will come up with their own ways to stop bad guys. O'Hara is also good while the rest of the cast, in small roles do well. 8 out of 10",8,0,0,11 January 2005
The Jungle Book," Quick Reviews!!
","Another true classic from Disney, a film almost everyone saw when they were small, and one of the few which they all remember. Based loosely on Kipling's novel, The Jungle Book tells of Mowgli- a boy raised in the jungle by wolves, hearkening back to the Romulus and Remus legend. Mowgli is sent back to humanity by the wolves as Shere-Kahn, a monstrous tiger is coming, and enjoys the taste of 'man-cubs'. along the way, Mowgli meets Baloo the singin', dancin' bear who teaches him the Bear Necessities of life, Bagheera the panther who protects him, King Louie an Orang-utan and Kaa the hypnotic snake. But Shere-Kahn is on their trail.The Jungle Book has many memorable characters and musical numbers, directed brilliantly into the plot. The animation is a success and it is a story which everyone can enjoy. The funniest moment, for unanswerable reasons is King Louie using his own arms as a skipping rope. I've always found the ending a sad one as I didn't want Mowgli to return to the apparent civilisation; the jungle seems much more fun. Most of the colonial themes are of course absent from the original story, but it is not difficult to read these into the film. However, why bother, as it is not meant to be seen in such a way. Every child will enjoy this, less to enjoy for the older viewer compared with later films.7.5 out of 10",7,1,2,25 March 2005
Final Destination 2," Quick Reviews!!
","Of all the Scream clones, or more appropriately, teen horror movies to come from the nineties and beyond, Final Destination has always been the best. It seemed likely then that it would get a sequel, and deservedly so as the first was so effective, and we want to see what has become of the survivors. As with the majority of horror sequels, the gore is increased, the deaths are more elaborate, and the plot introduces something new. And of course it is not as good. However, the makers of Final Destination 2 clearly recognise this, and rather than trying to make a superior film, they try to out-do the first in shock value and death scenes, and at times succeed, as well as making the story involving and entertaining too. Much of the tension, thematic depth, and style of the first film is lost, but it more than makes up for this with buckets of blood which will satisfy all us gore hounds.Kimberley and her friends are leaving for Spring Break. On the highway she has a premonition of a massive pile-up and her own death, as well as the deaths of several others. She stops her car, thereby preventing her involvement with the crash, and all the cars behind her whose passengers would have been killed. A cop intervenes and she tries to explain. The pile-up occurs anyway, and her friends are killed too. Soon it becomes apparent that they have cheated death, who is now coming to pick them off one by one. Some believe this, some don't, and Kimberley decides to find Clear rivers, the sole survivor of last year's similar phenomenon. Together they try to stop death from getting them, but it seems that death will not be fooled so easily this time.Like the first film, an unusual amount of other story lines could have been conceived if a certain character had done a certain thing differently. Questions of fate though are largely avoided in favour of elaborate deaths and effects, though this is still an intelligent film. As all the survivors of the car crash are connected to those who died in the aftermath of the plane crash, it may be thought that death is doing this simply to pull Clear into the open. The ripple effect may be said to be ever expanding, that soon everyone will die, and of course this is true, but while death may be stalking us all, new life ensures that we will continue to exist. The deaths here are mostly more impressive, less subtle, as some of the original deaths were slow and seemingly could have been easily avoided. Here, heads are smashed off, people are burnt and cut apart and various implements are used to deadly, and funny effect. The film moves quickly, with less emphasis on characterisation than the first had, but there are still many laughs, shocks and excitement. While the first may have made you genuinely fear death, this is mainly about fun and gore, with the odd are of discussion such as...what if? 7.5 out of 10",7,0,0,21 March 2005
Alien," Quick Reviews!!
","The movie which forever changed the sci-fi genre, taking elements from past monster movies, going against the spotless visuals of 2001 to create a new vision of the future and one of the most atmospheric movies ever. Rarely does this genre produce a film which inspires acclaim from fans and critics, but Ridley Scott's 1979 classic does just that, beginning a famous franchise, story, character and monster, and spawning many inferior clones.Some time in the future, mankind has the capability of effective space travel, with many planets holding outposts. We are introduced to a crew of miners who work for an all-powerful Foundation, and are returning home on their massive ship the 'Nostromo' after a long period of work. The crew are Dallas-in charge, Parker and Brett-mechanics, Ash-doctor, and Ripley, Lambert and Kane. However, they have been awakened from hyper-sleep early, by it seems an SOS signal. They discuss what to do, eventually deciding that they must investigate. They follow the call to a planet, and Kane, Dallas and Lambert go outside for a closer look. They discover what appears to be a crashed ship of unknown origin, and some sort of organism attach's itself to Kane's face. Tension grows as they try to take the creature off, but eventually it goes by itself. Kane wakes and seems to be OK. Soon though, things turn nasty, and a creature is lose on the ship. The remaining crew members try to find it and kill it, but it has grown, and is violently hungry.Alien works primarily because of three factors. 1. The performances are all immaculate, with some actors giving career bests. Weaver is immensely strong coming to movies from the stage, the veterans all take it seriously even though it first appeared to be a silly scary movie, Holm is extremely good as Ash etc. 2. Scott's taut direction adds an edge to the script, his stunning visual style giving the sense of isolation and fear perfectly, the lighting is effective, everything is wonderfully detailed and he knows that less is more when it comes to showing the monster. 3. Geiger's creature is terrifying, and one of the best monsters ever made, beautiful, sultry, horrifying, mysterious, mechanical and deadly, everything a predator, and a monster should be. The story itself is strong, but it is these three factors which raise it from B-movie status, as well as some truly memorable scenes-The chest burster, Dallas in the tunnels, Ripley's final encounter, and Ash's revelation. The film is incredibly intelligent at a time when sci-fi movies were taking over, and it is one of the few which still remains powerful today. Everything about the film is near-faultless, but perhaps it suffers slightly from being too detached or cold. This is a minor complaint clearly. The set designs, the creation of the Alien and the face hugger are all realistic in the sense that we believe these things could conceivably exist. It is definitely the stuff of nightmares, an unseen foe stalking us, seemingly without weakness or emotion, its single motive to kill us. The recent director's cut shown in cinemas proved that the movie can still excite audiences, even those who have seen it several times, and there were certainly screams when I saw it.9 out of 10",9,0,1,6 April 2005
Taxi Driver," Quick reviews!
","Can't say what hasn't been said...: In my opinion, this is De Niro's best performance. Unfortunately for me, everything that can be said about this movie has already been said, so I will simply say why I enjoy it. Apart from De Niro's performance, the violence is tackled well, without being glorified (remembering Bickle's reason for it), but without seeming over the top. Insomnia has never been more perfectly shown, and the imagery of the sleazy New York night life is gruesomely bleak. Unlike many films which try to bleak, or depressing for ninety minutes, then shove a twisty, happy ending in our faces, Taxi Driver leaves us with an ambiguous conclusion. Bickle is psychotic, which may or may not be his fault, and that does not matter. We do not know what is future will be. (If he survives that is, the final scenes may be a dream sequence)",9,0,0,19 May 2004
Rocky II," Quick Reviews!!
","My Favourite of the series, only marginally more so than the original as the humour is increased, but not so much that it becomes embarrassing. Rocky, although now a celebrity in Philadelphia sees his life become increasingly difficult. He is struggling with money after marrying Adrian and hearing she is pregnant. The only solution it seems is a rematch with Creed, but he risks losing his sight and family. Again, every performance is good, but it is the banter involving Rocky and his knowledge of finance, and how to cope with being a B-list celebrity which makes the movie most effective. Rocky is taken advantage of, everyone takes cheap shots at him until he realises not only must he fight Creed again, but win to prove he is not simply a fluke, a one day name, and gain respect. 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,24 November 2004
The Godfather: Part II," Quick Reviews!
","Again, what can be said that hasn't already been said?The acting and direction are flawless, and we get a clearer view of The Family and their background. I've never felt de Niro's performance was Oscar winning because his part in the movie simply isn't big enough, but he should easily have won several others for other performances over the years.If anything, the plot is more complex and involving than the first film. Pacino's change from the first film is revolutionary, and Cazale is perfect as the unfortunate Fredo, and the rest of the massive cast are excellent. Don Fanucci is a great addition to the story, and has my favourite line-'just enough to wet my beak'. 10 out of 10",10,1,3,11 November 2004
Léon: The Professional," Quick reviews!!
","A strange film blending genres and emotions, made all the more strange because it is widely seen as one of the best films of the 90's. This is deserved as it brings together a talented cast and director with varied characters to a brilliant story about a hit-man who befriends a girl after her family is slaughtered by a local crooked cop. Jean Reno stars as Leon, in his best performance, the hit-man, 100%successful, professional, silent, but lonely. Gary Oldman is the crooked cop, stealing almost every scene he is in. Natalie Portman plays Mathilda, in easily one of the best child performances ever, conveying sadness and loneliness with hope and innocence, and anger and pain. The rest of the cast is also noteworthy.We are introduced to Leon, we see his mundane life, occasionally interspersed with acts of violence necessary for his career. His only friend is a pot plant, and his boss who fully respects him, exploits him to a certain degree because Leon is so quiet. He lives alone in a flat. A few doors down is Mathilda who lives with her abusive father, alcoholic mother, and innocent younger brother. They have seen each other occasionally in the corridor. Mathilda's father is in trouble with Oldman's character, and he is killed along with his wife and son when Mathilda is shopping. She arrives home to see what is still happening, knows she will be killed if she shows any emotion, so walks to Leon's door. Leon knows what has happened, and is torn between what to do. He cannot interfere, but eventually does the right thing. Soon the 2 become friends, and Mathilda wants to learn how to kill so she can get revenge. Oldman is looking for her though, and is not stupid.The film's direction is often beautiful, and it complements the story perfectly, meaning that the tear-jerking scenes, action scenes, and everything else are all the more potent. Although the action is brilliant, it is the scenes between Leon and Mathilda which make the film so good. We watch them grow together, learning off one an another, and they learn that life does not have to be spent on your own. There are many funny parts, most involving the fact that Leon has been outside of society most of his life. The training scenes are good, and it is more a story of love than anything else. Many critics mention a potential sexual relationship between the two, admittedly this may have happened in the future, but by the end the most important thing is that they have found a special person who can give them hope. The ambiguous and touching ending will pull at the heart, but we know that Mathilda can be strong now by herself. Although this is growing in fame it is still relatively unknown, but it is a startling film which everyone should see. 10 out of 10",10,1,3,8 February 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Quick Reviews!!
","It is true that I cannot add anything new to what has already been said about these films as they have already become classics with many millions giving their praise, and a few their disdain. I had always been a fan of Peter Jackson and when I heard he was making these films I immediately thought-gore, humour, gore, well-executed set pieces, and strong imagination. Although the amount of blood has been toned down it is still present in the Jackson trademark style, along with all his other traits. With this series Jackson has created the defining movies of this generation.A brief introduction is given by Galadrial, a powerful elf telling of the history of Middle-Earth and of the Ring. We learn of its terrible power and desire, and the tone is set for the entire series. We then travel to the Shire, a peaceful, idyllic place signifying all that is good in the world. The inhabitants are creatures called Hobbits, a race which usually keeps itself to itself, farmers with little thought for what lies beyond what they see. However, a few of them have a taste for adventure. Bilbo Baggins, on the eve of his birthday is writing a biography of sorts about his past trials and adventures involving the Ring. His young nephew Frodo has loved hearing Bilbo's stories, and often yearns to experience a more exciting life. The town gets together to celebrate, Bilbo's old friend Gandalf the Grey, a Wizard has also come. When Bilbo disappears, the town is confused and Gandalf becomes worried-The Ring has been awakened and is trying to find its way back to Sauran, its master who will bring a dark age upon the world. Eventually Gandalf finds the Ring and gives it to the reluctant Frodo. He is told of its power, and of the dangerous quest he must go on. The Black Riders are searching for it, and Frodo must leave the Shire. Along for the journey come his gardener and friend Sam, and two local, mischievous hobbits, Merry and Pip. After a while and many trials they reach the Elf Council who decide the Ring must be taken to Mordor and destroyed forever. Morder is the darkest, most evil place in the land, guarded by thousands of terrible creatures, but Frodo accepts the task. His friends will join him, along with Aragorn a human, Gimli a dwarf, Boromir a human, and Legolas an elf. Together they form the fellowship of the ring, and begin their long adventure.Not only is Fellowship one of the most spectacular and effects filled films ever, it is full of luscious, real scenery. The cinematography alone is a strong reason for watching. However, it is the story which takes central stage, the interaction between the characters inviting a yearning sense from the audience to be part of their team. Every performance from the huge cast is impressive, and there are many exciting, funny, scary, and sad moments. Each character has their own story and feelings as they all try to support Frodo. The attention to detail is stunning, the sets, wardrobe and battle scenes are all immaculate. The fights are some of the best in recent memory, and for sheer size only the sequels and Star Wars prequels can match them. In fact the only let down is the music; it is decidedly average for a film of such huge emotional scope and there is really only one memorable track. It seems to cry out for a few themes worthy of Star Wars status. However, for a film this good, this is a minor factor. Each sequel improves in some way and everyone will have their favourite.9 out of 10",9,1,2,12 April 2005
The Thing," Quick Reviews!!
","Carpenter does it again with his remake of The Thing from Another World, but does the unthinkable by making it superior to the original. Extremely atmospheric, excellent effects which to this day have not been beaten, scary, thought provoking and ambiguous, good characters, great story all make The Thing one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.Out in the arctic are a crew of men, working for months at their outpost. With little contact with the outside world, little entertainment and the same 10 or so faces every day, life can become monotonous. One day a helicopter appears, shooting at a dog on the ground. The 'copter lands, and the pilot shots one of the outpost crew, who is in turn shot and killed. The other pilot accidentally blows himself and the Helicopter apart. The dog is taken inside the camp, and the men decide to investigate. They realise that an alien spaceship was uncovered, and that a being which can reproduce itself many times by killing its host and making an exact copy has invaded their base. it could be anyone of them, or two, or 3...and soon the men are falling to pieces, not trusting anyone. A test is worked out to decide who is real, and who isn't, leading to a final confrontation.A brilliant idea, flawlessly executed, The Thing is one of those films which can be repeatedly watched without becoming boring, and we can find new things each time we watch. Some brilliant dialogue in the typical vein of Carpenter, spoken by typical Carpenter characters, and a haunting score all add to the atmosphere. We do not know who is what or what is who, but it never becomes complicated. Our paranoia grows, the isolation soon affects us as it does the characters, and we do not know what to expect next. The effects are, quite simply amazing- the arms being bitten off, the digs changing, heads turning into spiders, they are insanely innovative and work wonderfully. Russell as Mac is a strong leader, but only because he wants to get out alive, and if that isn't a possibility, then he won't let the thing get out either. The whole world would be screwed if that happened. As the rest of the cast are good actors, but hardly established names, this adds to the mystery. Palmer is funny, Childs is volatile, Blair loses it quickly, each man has their own traits, but the thing knows this.The ending has gone down as a classic cliffhanger, another classic Carpenter trademark- we must imagine what will happen to any surviving character, the story is over but we will always want to know more. We wonder if the thing is dead or not, if it is how will anyone get out, if it isn't, what does the future hold. Carpenter was at his prime here, and when he is, no-one is better.10 out of 10",10,0,1,22 February 2005
North by Northwest," Quick Reviews!
","Another Hitchcock classic, and further proof of his versatility, while keeping to his usual themes of deception, trust, and hidden personalities. This film has action, twists, humour, suspense, as well as great acting, and puts many recent movies which claim to 'have it all' to shame. Again, i cannot add anything which hasn't already been said, as this is a well loved classic. the set pieces that everyone knows are easily the best Hollywood produced before Bond, as are the double-entendres, and some of the dialouge is so sharp you have to rewind it to hear it again, write it down and wait for an opportunity to use it...Another film that it is difficult to find real fault with. 10 out of 10",10,1,1,12 November 2004
The Shining," typingtypingtypingtypingtypingtypingtypingtypingtypingtypingtypingtyping
","Kubrick veers away from King's text, and it works, as anyone who has seen King's TV remake will agree. Again, plenty of memorable images, for me, the two ghosts (?) wearing rabbit masks is the best, although few remember this. Writer's block leads to paranoia again, perhaps making Jack more susceptible to the voices inside, and outside his head. The key is that, in a theme which always interests me, no help will come from the outside, and the only escape is via your own skills, and luck. If outside help does arrive, it usually gets an axe in its back. Nicholson wins here, although everyone is great. one of the best horror movies of the eighties. 8 out of ten",8,0,1,16 May 2004
Edward Scissorhands," Quick Reviews!!
","The movie that established Depp in our minds, in probably his best performance as the deformed, unfinished creation of an eccentric scientist. Rightly called a modern fairy tale as it has all the hallmarks of those classic stories- a strange character, some sort of moral, a dark side, a world almost like our own but slightly warped, a story anyone can enjoy. Edward Scissorhands combines this story with some wonderful acting and characters, memorable score, beautiful cinematography and imagery, which makes an excellent, tender film with the typical Burton trademarks.The story is told by a grandmother to her granddaughter, and we get to hear it too, beginning with Edward's creation and development. He grows and is taught about manners, etiquette and other things by his father, but is alone, never seeing or interacting with the outside world. From his room he can see the nearby neighbourhood, within touching distance, but as he is different he cannot go to them. One day his father dies, leaving him unfinished- with giant scissors where his hands should be. He does not understand, and stays in his massive dark house alone. When a local Avon lady, annoyed because of the lack of interest by her neighbours in what she is selling, she decides to try the scientists house, unaware of what is inside. No-one has been there before, it is a typical small town haunted house in the eyes of most. She enters the house when no-one answers, meets Edward and decides to take him home to her family as he is alone and a mess. Looking past his 'hands' she accepts him, and her son and husband also try to. Soon he becomes a ray of interesting light in the bored neighbourhood, everyone wants to meet the new guy, and he shows his talent for hedge and dog trimming. However, Edward is enchanted by Kim, the daughter and falls in love. Kim is with a bully of a boyfriend, and soon he and the rest of the neighbourhood take advantage of Edward- he just wants to be nice. Soon though his novelty wears off, and most people see him as evil and dangerous, something to disrupt their daily lives. They chase him away, and the story looks like it will end in tragedy.Everything in the film works perfectly, every corner of the cast from actors to set designers all do amazingly well. It is one of those rare times when everything seems to come together and fit completely. Dianne West is ideal as the mother Peg, only wanting to help Edward, not trying to score points off her friends. Anthony Michael Hall as Kim's boyfriend is also an ingenious choice as he emits that typical jock persona, believing he can get whatever he wants, trying to overpower everyone but scared of his father. Vincent Price is the inventor, and gives an admirable and touching performance, a fitting way to end his illustrious career, and the rest of the family and neighbours are all uniquely odd, made even more strange by the routine they live in and the idyllic place they live. Ryder as Kim is also intensely sympathetic, first scared of Edward, but growing to understand and eventually fall in love with him. But overall, in acting terms it is Depp's film, and no-one could have done better. He completely takes over the role, adding little touches, eye movements and such to add to the character, so that we too love Edward by the end. However, his performance is such that we too realise he cannot be part of the community, he will never fully understand them as they cannot understand him, whether he is in love or not, and this could be harmful for him and others. He does not want to hurt anyone, and so must be on his own. He is a tragic figure, and the movie seems to be saying that the outcast can be heroic, beautiful and tender, but must remain an outcast to keep these characteristics.Again Burton gives the Gothic look he has become famous for, and this is undoubtedly his most visually beautiful film. Batman had more stunning sets, camera work and stunts, but the charm factor here is almost overwhelming. The Gardens, snow, the ice sculptures, the picture perfect coloured houses and cars all juxtaposed against Edward and his habitat. Edward himself is a work of art, scarred but not horrific. Edward's home is a wonderful excuse for Burton and the designers to show off, full of shadows and weird inventions. The music adds immensely to the film, raising our emotions that much higher, and it is probably Elfman's best. Favourite scenes include Kim dancing under the falling ice, and Edward sitting on the pavement with the dog, but every shot and scene is excellent.The only fault i can find with the film is that it isn't long enough, or rather, i wish it was longer just so we could be part of that world for a few minutes more. There could have been more scenes between Kim and Edward. It leaves you with a good feeling, and I cannot see any other faults with it. Some may feel it is overly sentimental, but it isn't, some may feel it is simple, but it is meant to be. A film for outcasts everywhere, but one which should be enjoyed by all, as we all feel like outcasts at some point.10 out of 10",10,1,1,22 February 2005
Dark City," Quick reviews!
","Carrying on with the look of The Crow, Proyas gives Dark City an appropriately nourish atmosphere. Now, did The Matrix rip this off? The similarities are blatant, the opening few scenes are almost identical to the Wachowskis' movie, and some of the early dialogue is the same. The look is similar, as is the story to some extent: your life is being controlled by an outside, unseen force, and the human race is their little play thing. Then again, Proyas' story has elements from Metropolis, and Blade Runner. Sewell's character Murdoch wakes up, with no idea who he is, or who the dead woman beside him is. When he is chased by a group of leather clad baldies, he begins to wonder what the hell is going on. He questions why no-one can remember the last time there was daylight, or remember the way out of the city. Help comes in the form of odd doctor Sutherland, who seems to e the only other person in the city who doesn't mysteriously fall asleep at midnight. Sutherland teaches Murdoch how to harness his powerful gift, and they try to bring down the bad guys. Questions of free will, will arise from this, and like The Matrix, we will wonder whether it would be better not to know. At the end, there is still no escape from the city, although Murdoch's power to create remains. I know many people on this board find Connelly very attractive, I've never been one of those people, but she looks better in this than any other film I've seen her in.",8,0,2,24 May 2004
54," Quick Reviews!!
","The story of the World's Greatest Club, 54 deals more with the lives of the club's employies and fans rather than with the club and the scandal surrounding it. Maybe if Cameron Crowe had directed this it would have been a lot better. The characters are not the most compelling or likable, but the Club itself looks like excellent fun. Myers is probably the best here, hamming his role perfectly, Neve is good but her character is not very appealing, Hayek unfortunately is given little to do, but does it well, and Phillipe's character is annoying, but he proves he isn't just a pretty boy by giving an okay performance. He has done better in other roles, just like the rest of the cast, but that isn't the fault of the actors. The story isn't involving enough, but there are some funny, and touching moments. The film was severely cut before release, maybe the original version would be better. The costumes and the music, and the sex and drugs are what keep this from being boring, but with a little more thought, and less cuts, this could have been very good 6 out of 10",6,0,1,25 November 2004
Aliens," Quick Reviews!!
","James Cameron made his second masterpiece with this, the sequel to Ridley Scott's classic space horror show. Cameron, a director who will always ensure he gets exactly what he wants, extremely talented and ingenious, brought the series in a new direction, keeping much of the tension of the original, but upping the excitement and action.After Ripley went into hyper-sleep at the end of Alien, hoping that someone would find her floating through space and pick her up, she travelled for over 50 years before being picked up by 'The Company'. She wakes up and tries to come to terms with all that has happened since she was asleep-her daughter grew up and died, 'The Company' has become more interested in the alien she claims to have encountered, and the planet where she found the alien has become a mining colony. During interrogation she tells the suits what happened to her, and expressed the need for someone to investigate the 'alien' planet. They charge her with the destruction of her previous ship. However, when they receive a distress call from the planet, a group of marines is ordered to investigate. Burke, a company Rep persuades Ripley to come along as she is the only one to have encountered an alien, and because her recurring nightmares are stopping her from living her life. We are introduced to each marine, all tough, hardened fighters, seemingly well-equipped for any danger. Arriving on the planet we see that there had been a massive recent battle, and there seem to be no human survivors. When the meet Newt, a lone colonist girl, Ripley becomes attached to her, but an Alien attack wipes out most of the marines. On attempting to flee, their jump ship crashes. The only way out is to bring by remote the 2nd drop-ship and wait, hoping that the aliens will not attack again. They do. And the Queen appears too.Aliens must surely rank as one of the most exciting movies ever made. At well over 2 hours it is a testament to Cameron, the script-writers and the cast that the pace of the film never slows. Every time the characters think they may have a chance, something happens to make them think otherwise. Everything is giving the most acute detail, from the marines' garb, to the miniature sets and craft designs. The score is militaristic, keeping with the charge and feel of the movie, and the action is very strong and brilliantly edited. The aliens themselves are still terrifying, and The Queen is awesome. The famous power-loader fight scene is excellent, just one of the many highlights. The planet itself is grim and dark, the perfect place for the creatures to be, and the darkness and tight corridors of the colony add to the tension, atmosphere and claustrophobia.There is a wide range of characters here, each distinct much like the first film. Even if we do not get to see them for very long, we are given a strong impression of their backgrounds because of their own personal dress and dialogue. Every performance is worthy of mention too, and Weaver's performance was definitely worthy of the Oscar. Ripley progresses here, becoming one of the strongest female characters in movie history, learning and adapting with the Marines, but retaining her maternal instincts and disgust for the company. In fact, the fight and chase involving the Queen, Ripley and Newt is almost like custody battle, a fight to see who is the best mother. Burke begins seeming friendly, but of course his interest is in bringing back a specimen. Bishop is a brilliant inclusion remembering Ripley's last encounter with a Droid. Hicks, played by Biehn is an excellent character, strong marine but not an emotionless, stupid grunt. Paxton steals many scenes as Hudson, spitting out some of the film's best dialogue, at times tough and terrified. Henn as Newt is a revelation in her first performance, dealing with the script and content perfectly. Vasquez must go down as one of the best cult action characters, equally as strong as any of the men, even if she has a short fuse. Goldstein is very good in the role. Apone as the 'Sarg' is also good, and Gorman begins as a fool but redeems himself later. The rest of the cast are all good, even if most are only their to be killed. With such a good cast, Aliens becomes even better.This film cannot be praised enough. Although there are those who feel it is inferior to the first because it has more action and supposedly weaker characterisation, it has to be said that the two films are different entities, the first a horror, the second a sci-fi action. Like The Terminator, Cameron puts in many effective scares so that it transcends the genre, becoming something more. Cameron says he wants to return to Sci-Fi.

","Rightfully hailed as one of the scariest and most famous movies off all time, The Exorcist was both critically acclaimed and smashed when it was released. Although 30 years have past, the film is still one which inspires fear, caution and awe. However, does it still live up to the name of 'scariest movie ever', or has time taken its toll? The Exorcist, adapted from Blatty's novel tells of a young girl becoming possessed by a demon. Her mother cannot cope with her sudden change, and being a famous actress, stops at nothing to find out what is wrong with her daughter, employing scientists, doctors, psychiatrists etc. At first they claim her behaviour my be caused by a brain lesion, others think it may be drugs or simply the trauma of growing up in what they feel is an unstable environment. However, her behaviour goes beyond extreme and the doctors know the case is above their understanding. When a friend dies, a cop investigates. It is recommended that perhaps Regan should see a preacher. Chris Macneil tracks down Father Karras who has recently been having a crisis of faith. When he encounters Regan, he too feels out of his depth and becomes even more troubled. Father Merrin, a man who has followed supposed demons around the world, and who is the only one to have performed an exorcism before, is called in to help, and the two men begin. It becomes a struggle of faith and between good and evil, to save Regan's life.Freidkin's direction here is cold and stylish, and we get a real sense of something, not only lurking inside Regan, but outside the house, throughout the city, and inside many others. Blatty's novel only gets exciting in the last few pages, and Freidkin does well to make the entire film nervy and full of fear. The constant images of the loss of faith in individuals and society greatly add to the growing fear. Butchered statues in churches, priests meeting in shadowy places and having no inner strength etc. Blair steals the film with her brilliant performance, helped by the score, sets and effects of course, but her transformation from innocent 12 year old to monster and back seems effortless for the actress, terrifying for the character. The supporting cast are all flawless too, meaning this is not just another messy horror film banned for content, but a true cinematic classic, rich in theme and substance. Burstyn is strong as Chris, trying to juggle being a single, famous working mother and the attack of this evil force. Von Sydow's performance is small but effective, and he once again commands the screen while on it. Miller is excellent as Karras, a complex character whom he develops fully, and Cobb is also good. The famous theme, although barely heard during the film is one of horror's best, but it is the mix of screams and noises which add to the atmosphere and other-worldliness.The content- the blasphemy, swearing and actions of Blair, was the main reason for the film's various bans. However, with society as it is now, with all that has happened in the past 30 years, this seems tame, or at least it does not have the same impact it once did. However, this is not to say the film loses its power. It is still frightening, with many moments which will haunt you, the floating, head-spinning, vomiting scenes, and of course, the spider-walk. It is true that now we can watch and understand it more effectively, whereas upon its release we may have been biased, or seen it purely because we had heard that it was evil. The flashes of that demonic face will get a few jumps out of people, while many will continue to avoid seeing it just because of what they have heard about it. This is unfortunate as it is a truly great film, one which lives up to its fame.8 out of 10",8,2,3,14 March 2005
Resident Evil," Quick Reviews!!
","What had the potential to be the greatest zombie movie ever is let down by poor studio choices, distancing itself as far from the games as possible. However, it remains a solid action movie if not the terrifying, emotional, complex horror it could have been. Admittedly, truly bringing the game to life for a two hour movie would be an extremely difficult process, and those making it could easily have made a mess, mangling the characters and story. It has always been my opinion that the games should be made into feature length TV movies, say 2 two hour episodes for each game. This way everything would fit in, and the budget would not need to be great. Of course this is just a pipe dream, and what we have is not as bad as some make out, with many good points.The film starts with an outbreak at the Umbrella facility. Chaos ensues, and everyone appears to die. We then meet Alice, a woman inside an eerily empty mansion at night. She does not know who she is, and only has flashbacks of her life. Soon a group of marines enter, assuming she is a civilian, and along with the other survivors they try to work out what happened to the facility. They soon find out that everyone has been turned into zombies by an evil computer programme and they soon worry about how to escape. Though Alice is not what she first appears to be, and neither are some other survivors.The main problem with the film is that there is little fear created, and it is insanely watered down, with little gore. Fans of the series are used to high tension, jumps, threat and bloodshed, but this is simply not present here. Also, most of the marines are wiped out in a laser room, and only one is killed by a zombie. The licker effects are OK, but there are no Hunters, Spiders or Tyrants. As well as this, most of the marines get small parts, look similar and we fail to feel anything for them. Now the good points; Johovich is very good in the role, and there are a few decent twists, like the game. The way her mysterious past is revealed is clever and well-balanced against the escape. Howver the clear star is Michelle Rodriguez, giving an excellent, strong performance akin to Vasquez in Aliens. The action scenes are dealt with well, especially those involving the dogs, and the lighting and camera-work is good. The film makes a good attempt at creating an original story, and the direction is sound. Of course, us fans would have loved to see Wesker's antics and our favourite STARS members being picked off. Maybe one day the games will make truly great movies, but why complain when we still have the games. Obviously a let down for fans, but still a pretty good actioner.7 out of 10",7,1,2,6 April 2005
The Princess Bride," Quick Reviews!!
","One of those odd films which is very high in the overall IMDb charts, much loved, and although it is overrated it is still a good, entertaining film with much to recommend it. It begins with an old man telling his grandson a bed time story of princesses, giants, magic, and mystical lands which the kid hopes will have no kissing in it. Naturally it does. We are thrown into the world of Buttercup, a beautiful young girl kidnapped by the evil Prince Humperdinck. It is up to her true love Westley to save her, but she thought he was killed by pirates. Along the way he meets many strange people and creatures, travels across dangerous lands and eventually must fight the evil Prince.This is a story which takes all the usual fairy story traits and aims to light-hearted with the moral about love conquering no matter what is thrown at you. It is engaging and unusual and succeeds in being a cult hit. It realises the cheesy stuff involved, that young boys don't particularly want to hear love stories, but ones full of adventure, but this is suitable for all. The cast has some good cameos from Billy Crystal to Andre the Giant, Robin Penn is pretty but good have been better, and Carey Elwes is as annoying as always, but this is his best, and most effective role. There is some good dialogue, and everyone should enjoy it, but it falls short of other films of its kind from the same era such as Willow. The action is often less spectacular than other films, and the comedy, although refreshingly unique does not always work. These are minor things though, and it is clear to see why so many love it.7.5 out of 10",7,2,4,21 March 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," quick reviews!
","Look at them go! Aww bless, with all that running up walls and across trees, they're gonna sleep well tonight. For a better summary of this movie, I'm sure there are a billion critics waiting to tell you how much they love/hate it. A sacred sword is stolen from a renowned warrior, and a young girl is rebelling against her planned future. The warrior tries to work out the mystery, keep his peaceful ways intact, and show his love to the only woman he truly cares for, and the thief causes continuous trouble. Some of the most impressive sword fights ever put on cinema, ranking with those in countless Hong Kong classics, Ang Lee's stunning film is filled with beauty. The photography of the landscapes are equal, if not more impressive than those in the LOTR trilogy, and you cannot help but gasp at the sights. Some excellent from acting, from the three leads, with Chow Yun Fat holding back the violent outbursts which made him famous from Hard-Boiled and The Killer. Anyone of the sword fights will provide memorable images, making this a movie which will be difficult to forget. Made many people who were afeard of subtitles conquer their fear. 8 out of 10",Null,0,0,24 May 2004
Hellboy," Quick Reviews!!
","After hearing rave reviews from America, and being a fan of Perlman I knew I had to see this movie. I have never read the comics, but as with comic book movies, they usually explain the basics. Hellboy is an above average comic adventure with some good effects and acting, but it is slightly too slow in places.Ron Perlman stars as the adult Hellboy, a demon which the Nazis brought from some Nether Region as an infant. However, he was rescued and Rasputin-the man in charge of raising him was trapped with his minions for 60 years. Hellboy was given to Prof Broom and he becomes the creatures father. Hellboy grows like a normal human, and becomes part of an elite team of freaks who fight evil. He joins Abe Sapian, an amphibious creature, and Liz a pyrotechnic woman who he falls for. However, she cannot control her powers and is locked away. When Rasputin and his evil forces return, it is up to the team to stop him, taking rookie agent John along. The two form an unlikely duo, and plan to bring down the bad guys once and for all.Perlman is excellent in the role, creating much of the film's humour. Blair and Pierce are also good in differing roles, Hurt is strong as the Prof, and Evans is OK as John. The action is good in parts, but the effects are very impressive, as is the make-up and sets etc. The story is a little wavy at times and can sometimes detach itself from the audience. However, there are enough exciting moments to keep us happy, and even as a comic book movie it is different and refreshing. Hopefully the sequel will be an improvement.7 out of 10",7,0,0,14 April 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Quick Reviews!!
","Continuing directly on from the events of the last film, the Fellowship has been destroyed and it seems the bad guys have the upper hand. Gandalf is gone, Boromir has been killed, and the enemy's forces are growing to vast numbers and in power. They are spreading across Middle-Earth destroying all people, all races who get in their way in their quest for Frodo and The Ring. Saruman has been seduced by the evil, adding his superior skills and seeking out the remaining Fellowship members. Frodo and Sam travel on towards Mordor, followed by a mysterious creature. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to rescue their friends Pip and Merry who were captured by the enemy, an ork army. Things are looking bleak.The Two Towers, in splitting up the group becomes a more personal film for each character as we get to know them more in their individual struggles. Jackso deals with the different stories brilliantly and we never get bored of watching one group too much. There is always something new happening, a new character, a new threat or battle, and we feel part of the proceedings. Again the attention to detail is breathtaking, and the acting is just as good from both the old and new characters. We meet Faramir, brother of Boromir who also seeks the Ring as he wants to please his father and save his own city, misguidedly. We meet Gollum, once Smeagol a creature corrupted and transformed over the years by the Ring. He wants it, believing it is his and his alone, and promises to be Sam and Frodo's guide into Mordor, along secret paths. Meanwhile Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli get an army together to protect the residents of Rohan in a massive battle against the evil forces of Sauran. The enemy is marching towards Gondor to destroy the worlds of man forever, and the good guys must fight for the two towers between Mordor and Isenguard. Merry and Pip meet the Ents, an ancient race of tree like creatures with immense power but slow pace. They set out to stop Saruman.It is this film which heightens the emotional impact of the series. We learn more of Aragorn's past, and his tragic romance with Arwen who must decide between her immortality or her love. The banter between Gimli and Legolas continues, Frodo and Sam begin to drift apart because of the traitorous Gollum, but not all is lost...Theoden has been saved by an old friend an uses his old courage to rally his troops to victory, his strong-willed daughter Eowyn taking an interest in Aragorn. We learn of Faramir's life which will be important in the next film. Again the effects are superb, and the battle scenes are probably the most epic and sweeping yet. They are all only there though to give Frodo and Sam a slight chance of making it to Mordor. Another truly stunning feat by all involved.10 out of 10",10,1,1,12 April 2005
Donnie Brasco," Quick Reviews!!
","At times more like Heat in style rather than Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco is a mix of many gangster films that have gone before, drawing parallels between mob life, and the real family life of each character, and showing the blurring of boundaries which can often occur. The style, the dialogue, the wit, the violence, everything we would expect to see is here, but there are enough good moments to keep the movie unique, and there are some good performances from typically very good actors. The film does not dwell on the scenes of murder, but rather focuses on characterisation, and the relationship between Donnie Brasco, the undercover agent who succumbs to the mafia way, and Lefty, an aging mobster who, in spite of his dedication and respected work has little to show for it, and never seems to rise through the ranks.Johnny Depp plays Joe, an FBI agent, married with kids. He goes undercover as Donnie Brasco, an orphan from Florida to try and infiltrate the New York mafia. When Lefty, a member, takes interest in him, Donnie becomes part of the gang. Lefty teaches him everything and acts like a father, and they become close as Donnie sees how Lefty wishes he could get away with his family, and hates the fact that he is always 'passed over'. Madesen plays Sonny Black, a member who is rising ahead of Lefty even though he is younger and has done less. They move to Florida as Black tries to set up on his own, but the FBI raid his new club. They believe there is a rat, and kill one of their own thinking it was him. Lefty and Donnie know he was not a rat though. Black decides to kill Sonny Red and the other bosses so that he can have New York, and by this time Donnie is respected in the group and may one day become a 'made man'. His family have been deserted, and the FBI do not know what he is doing. Brasco says he is trying to get Lefty out of the group before he is killed, as when Brasco is uncovered, Lefty will undoubtedly die. Brasco is becoming just like the men he was supposed to be putting away, and getting deeper into trouble with each day.Overall it is the acting which keeps the film running at a steady, watchable pace. Depp is very good as Brasco, convincing in his dual roles and in his portrayal of how easy it can be to be seduced by power. Pacino is on familiar territory, and again is intense and thoughtful when he needs to be, giving another strong performance. Madsen is also good as the short-fused Sonny Black, and everyone else does what they have to do. The script is nothing we haven't seen before, and although it sometimes seems like it is trying to too easily explain the ways and words of the mob, it still has a few refreshing moments. The life seems less glitzy than in other gangster films, and there are few shows of extravagance. These men seem to be low on the ladder, and not as good at what they do as other characters from other movies. We are left feeling great sympathy towards Lefty, even though he has been in the game for so long, he seems naive and in need of a real son or someone to connect with. He never gets a break, and is always the man given the smaller jobs. He has been in the business for so long that he knows little else though, and we sense from the start that he will never get away. Even though Joe completes his job, he knows blood will be forever on his hands and after having a taste of the high life, it will be difficult for him to return to normality.8 out of 10",8,0,0,15 April 2005
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Quick Reviews!!
","Like Alien and Aliens, if the first Resident Evil was all about atmosphere, the second is all about action. The film takes off from exactly where the first film ended, with Alice waking in a hospital of some sort, alone, walking out into the city street with a shotgun to find that Raccoon has been decimated. Cars are overturned, on fire, bodies are strewn, and there are no signs of life. This, like the first had potential. Unfortunately it does not live up to expectations, but still manages to be decent.Residents of Raccoon are trying to flee the city, but are being stopped by soldiers who will shoot anyone who approaches. They are trapped, and the zombie infection is spreading quickly. As night approaches, the survivors try to find refuge, led by Jill Valentine! STARS member and character from the game she takes a reporter, a taxi driver and others into her protection. Also sent in are an elite group of ex-criminal marines who are mostly wiped out. The survivors Nicholi and Carlos join the group, and they also meet Alice, who seems to be slightly different. Dr. Ashford (?) is outside the city, and via cameras watches the survivors. His young daughter is still alive somewhere in the city and he phones them with an offer- if they can rescue her, he will airlift all of them to safety. However, an evil army dude has other ideas, and the powerful NEMESIS has been sent in to kill all remaining STARS members.The film has a good amount of action, but unfortunately the director decides to use that useless fast cut style which is one of the most awful inventions in cinema meaning we rarely see what is going on. The introduction of a few game characters is good, but they do not get the emotion from us that they do in the games, and in truth the script does not give them the chance. The black character is completely pointless and from the start we want him to die, though his energy is good and he does get a few laughs. Alice has become super-human and her relationship with the Nemesis is the main reason for watching. It does get better towards the end, and a few twists at the end add some quality. I was almost misled towards the end, when the copter crashes in Arklay, that perhaps now the characters would find a mansion and the real Resident Evil would begin. Something else happened though, setting up another sequel which again looks to have potential. Johovich is good again, but because of her new found power we feel less for her. The renegade survivors could be better in any following film, and Fehr and Guillory are both OK. With some better editing and direction, and more blood this could have been better. Still, it's worth seeing.7 out of 10",7,2,4,6 April 2005
Dumb and Dumber," Quick Reviews!!
","In the 90's the Farrelly brothers brought a new stream of gross-out toilet humour to the movies, and with Dumb and Dumber they hit their peak. There's Something About Mary may have been a bigger critical hit, but this film, uniting the talents of Carrey and Daniels is the funniest film of the decade, and for fans of this kind of humour, it is the best comedy ever. If you like your jokes subtle, or Frasier style then be warned-here we have lewd sexual jokes, making fun of blind kids, drinking urine, and laxatives...Dumb and Dumber is above all a road movie, following two friends who are dumber than the average person across America in search of a woman who left her briefcase behind. Lloyd (Carrey) works as a chauffeur, and after taking a beautiful woman to the airport he realises she has forgotten her briefcase. He takes it, intending to give it back to her, getting fired in the process. Unknown to him, she left it on purpose as it was full of money for the mob. Soon two hit men are after Lloyd. His friend Harry looks after dogs, and after he messes up another job he too is fired. After hitting rock bottom they decide to look for the briefcase girl, as Lloyd has fallen for her and hopes that she will love him when he returns her case. All he knows though is she is called Mary, and was going to Aspen. So they head out on the road. Along the way the get into a few scrapes, encounter the hit men, get lost, but eventually make it. When they find Mary, Harry goes on a date with her leaving Lloyd jealous. But they are both kidnapped leaving Lloyd to save the day.This is Carrey's funniest performance, every second he is on screen will make you laugh. Daniels is the perfect support, being equally dumb but letting Carrey steal the show. Holly is very good as Mary also, and the rest of the cast are good in mostly small parts, from the hit men to Sea-bass. The cinematography is very good for a comedy, exploiting the scenery to its fullest, the soundtrack is brilliant, and the plot is hardly complex, but nor is it simple. Funny moment are everywhere, and everyone has their favourites. Mine- the fact that when Harry asks Lloyd to buy only the bare essentials as they have no money left, then Lloyd goes and buys a jumbo hat etc, the dream sequence featuring lighting farts and a vicious fight, the Sea-Bass sequence, and the snowball Harry throws at Mary, yes laughing as i type (must watch it later). Other moments include, 'Pretty bird', 'Tick-tack sir?', the laxatives, and various one-liners. Aside from all the jokes, the film has a charm about it, the two friends are constant losers but we love them anyway. 1994 was a magnificent year for movies, many of my favourites come from then, and this is undoubtedly one of the best.10 out of 10",10,0,1,25 March 2005
The Evil Dead," Quick Reviews!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!one of the original video nasties and a classic piece of gory movie-making. This offers some genuine scares and shocks rather than full on slapstick gore that the sequels provide as we watch Ash and his friends fight off Armies of darkness after getting stranded in a cabin in the woods. After reading from the Book of the Dead, evil breaks loose, taking the souls of everyone, leaving Ash as the sole survivor. Grainy, cheap, with amateur actors, The Evil Dead succeeds where many big budget films do not, offering real scares and entertainment. Raimi may not have a 'message' to 'give' in the film, but that is irrelevant. What the audience wants is gore, and we get it. Campbell's acting skills are a welcome bonus. Very funny, and one film every horror fan should see and hopefully love. 8 out of 10",8,1,3,22 November 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Quick Reviews!!
","Billed as Tarantino's fourth film, Kill Bill Vol 1 is both a departure from what he has done before, and a mix of all previous films. It is primarily a Kung Fu revenge movie with many nods to past martial arts classics. Uma Thurman plays The Bride, a pregnant woman shot and left for dead at her wedding by Bill and his gang, the people she used to work for. After lying in a coma for four years, she wakes and immediately begins her quest for revenge. She is a killer, and all of her abilities remain, so she travels to Japan to get herself the greatest sword ever made and pick off her old gang one by one by one...All the trademarks of the Auteur are here, the dialogue, the non-linear story-telling, the clever camera angles, and the violence, but while his past films appealed to smart-ass critics, this is one for the fans, for himself, for all the kids like me who grew up watching Martial Arts movies. There is a great amount of blood-shed, although it is all brilliantly and stylishly filmed, and of course it is all done in a humorous way. As usual, Tarantino gets the best out of his cast, and they all seem to feel that it is an honour to work with him. Thurman is back to her best, old favourites like Sonny Chiba and Kenji Ohba are excellent, Lucy Liu is very good, and all the smaller parts are filled admirably. Julie Dreyfuss is also good, and Chiaki Kuriyama of Battle Royale Gonin and Shikoku fame. Tarantino is clearly having fun making this, experimenting with a variety of styles, from manga and anime to filtering between black and white and colour, the soundtrack is as effective as all his previous films, the instrumental mixing well with the songs and noises.Kill Bill Vol.1 works mainly, through all the impressive violence, fun and games because of the Bride and her quest. We want to see her get revenge, we want to see her destroy all the murdering mah-fah's who get in her way, and we want to see her Kill Bill. For that though you may have to wait for part two, unless you've wisely purchased that as well. There are a few twists, saving the biggest till last, but overall this is a fun movie, particularly for fans of fight films, setting us up well for the more emotive Vol 2, the Chinese Western part. A good return for the best new American director of the nineties.8 out of 10",8,0,2,4 April 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," Quick Reviews!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!When you take two of the most witty and talented directors of the decade and let them play with vampires, gangsters and cowboys, the outcome is always going to be interesting at the very least. FDTD manges to be more though, delivering more of what made each director popular in the first place- great dialogue and originality. A movie with a dedicated group of hardcore fans, though i'm sure the same can be said for any movie, it blends genres seamlessly, almost like Audition, fooling the viewer into expecting another run of the mill gangster film. The film features many good ideas, not all of which come off, and is so far the closest Tarantino has come to making his version of Rio Bravo. Great ideas, good script, good acting and direction, and some nice effects, again questioning the necessity for over-abundant CGI. It perhaps could have been a little longer, especially the Titty Twister section, with further development between the surviving characters, but maybe that would have changed the style and tone of the movie. For blood and banter, movies don't come much better than this. 8 out of 10",9,0,1,1 December 2004
The Fly," cronenberg and insects...
","I have always been a film lover who feels that if a movie doesn't contain at least three startling images which will live on in my memory forever, it will likely be forgotten. The Fly contains more than any other Cronenberg movie: The vomit, the elbow, each new stage in the metamorphosis as Brundle sees himself change in the mirror. Tragic, beautiful, horrifying, this is superior to the original in that we witness the effect the change has on Brundle's body, mind and on the few people who care for him. Great effects and performances from all.the sequel was average, though has a nice head squash scene. 8 out of 10",9,1,2,15 May 2004
Reservoir Dogs," Quick Reviews!!
","Some of the best performances of the decade, mixed with some of the best dialogue and most memorable scenes make Reservior Dogs Tarantino's first, and finest film. His direction is sure and every shot is played with utmost thought. The soundtrack is cool, the violence is strong, but not gratuitous, and the story is brilliantly told.A cop goes undercover with a gong of crooks to expose their ring, and takes part in a heist that goes terribly wrong, leaving several of the thieves dead, and a bullet in his own gut. As he can't reveal his identity as he bleeds, he waits with the other survivors to work out a plan. The other survivors are torn over what to do, they have the jewellery but jealousy and egos flare until the final shoot out. Every actor gives perhaps their best ever performance, every scene is full of tension as we wait for someone to blow. Professionalism is ironically sliced apart, and the flashback narrative hasn't been used so well since Rashomon. None of the characters are particularly likable, but we are with them for the duration. Several scenes are brutal, but filmed with the audience's morality in mind, and nothing is done just for the sake of it. Genius in every way.",10,1,3,10 December 2004
Total Recall," Quick Reviews!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!When you bring together one of the best satirical directors, two of the most evil looking men on the planet famed for their bad guy roles, and Arnie, to make a sci-fi film based on a Phillip K Dick story, it can't possibly be a failure. i'll start with the downers: if you are not an Arnie or sci-fi fan, you probably won't enjoy the high levels of violence or the one liners, and the plot may seem too confusing for it's own good. However, watch the film in its entirety, and it makes perfect sense.Good stuff: the Oscar winning effects are some of the best of the late eighties, early 90's, the plot will keep you guessing, and guessing wrong, Cox and Ironside are superb, the theme tune is a classic, and there is all the usual Arnie escapades. I won't give a plot overview as i'd be here all day, but if you like Arnie and sci-fi, this should be a favourite. 8 out of 10",8,1,3,22 November 2004
Rocky," Quick Reviews!!
","Whoever accuses Sylvester Stallone of being incapable of acting needs to watch this and then ask themselves if they are a fool. Acting has nothing whatsoever to do with slurring lines if that is what the role demands, and here Stallone gives one of the most famous performances in Cinematic history. If Spacey and Norton could show the range of emotions Stallone shows in this, i would admit that they are great actors, but they haven't yet, so i won't. Sentimental (not a flaw) and inspirational, we cheer for Rocky and hope that he will beat Apollo Creed, but perhaps more importantly we want to see him and Adrian end up together.Stallone's script is sharp, Avildson's direction seems effortless, every performance is superb, the characters are real and the music is memorable and rousing. Lots of great images-Stallone and Shire in the ring at the end, Rocky running through the streets, the opening shot of the inner city boxing ring establishing where Rocky has come from. This must rate with Shawshank as one of the most uplifting films of all time, starring one of cinema's most famous characters. 9 out of 10",10,0,0,24 November 2004
Pulp Fiction," Quick Reviews!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Possibly the most iconic film of the decade, and easily one of the best, Pulp Fiction is brimming with innovation, top class acting and jazzy dialogue. Tarantino weaves together a number of stories seamlessly, featuring gangsters and scumbags, violence and drugs, pop culture and art, and makes a perfectly coherent and enjoyable movie. The script is witty, the techniques he uses to tell the story are refreshing, The soundtrack is excellent, and used as part of the story, the dialogue is sharp but not cheesy or over the top, and the direction shows great skill and focus. Like The Godfather, and many other 'classic' films i have reviewed, there isn't much more i can say that hasn't been said before, except that this is the most recent film that has warranted that status. I still prefer Reservoir Dogs though. 9 out of 10",10,2,5,8 December 2004

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Back when few people laughed at Costner he starred in The Untouchables, a witty gangster film with excellent acting from an excellent cast, full of memorable set pieces under the tight direction of master of tension De Palma. The film is stylishly shot, everything and everyone looks great, and the plot (although far from historically accurate) keeps us chained down.Ness and his small group manage to work together to bring down Capone, played with relish by De Niro, whose own organisation shows signs of slippage- the boardroom baseball bat scene is a prime example. Although Connery's accent is highly dodgy he is pretty good, his final scene particularly touching. Garcia is also effective, but it is the set pieces which set the movie apart from others- the train station sequence is highly tense, the Monty chase is captivating, and the final rooftop scene is rewarding. Underrated, and overshadowed by the grittier Goodfellas. 8 out of 10",9,1,2,24 November 2004

Others could have done better, but there is not point in moaning about what's been done. It is a great movie. The ending is one of the most tragic, moving scenes ever filmed, perhaps Pacino's greatest moment. It moves at a slower pace than its predecessors, echoing Michael's tired descent, and the message that family life cannot be separated from The Business is never clearer.fine, it is not as good as the first two, perhaps it should have been made 5 or ten years earlier. 9 out of ten",8,1,3,16 May 2004
Die Hard," Quick Reviews!!
","Easily a favourite of action movie fans, and for many it is still the archetypal modern action film. Guns, explosions, stunts, fights yes, as well as plenty of one-liners all wrapped around the familiar 'one man against the bad guys' plot, and set inside a sky-scraper. Considerably more clever than most action films, thanks mainly to the script, we find ourselves cheering for McClane rather than simply sitting back and waiting for him to sweep up the bad guys. Rickman is perfect, shifting between being charming to being psychotic, innocent, whatever he wants to be, and Willis deals with the action and one-liners admirably. Veljohnson and Willis' relationship is just one of the many reasons for the film's unexpected success. McTiernen is an expert in this genre, and directs action better than anyone else in the period. Although the sequels are good, they could not match the action, claustrophobia, tension and charm of the original. 9 out of 10",9,1,1,30 November 2004
Psycho," One of, if not the...
","One of, if not the most influential horror movies ever, with many plot devices which have now become clichés, and proving that Hitchcock was the master of all genres. The themes can be talked about over and over, but it is the build up of suspense, coupled with Perkins's performance which keeps it fresh today. Perhaps not jumpy enough for some, although there are plenty of those moments, the film relies on the director's knowledge of the viewer: we are in his hands. Probably my favourite scene-when Bates bursts out of an upstairs room, with the overhead shot. Deliberately gritty and bleak, and no pimply teens to be found...those were the days. 9 out of 10",9,0,1,16 May 2004
Scream 2," Quick Reviews!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Not as good as the original, let's get that out of the way. It is part of a trilogy, and sequels are for the most part inferior. Wes Craven knows this, lets get that out of the way. But when the fans want more, and when the story isn't finished, sequels are inevitably made. But it is still a good movie, still better than any over the other teen slasher movies of the period, and retains many elements which made the original so good.OK, now that we understand Wes Craven knew exactly what he was doing, we can discuss the good and bad points. Bad- too many unnecessary characters, though strangely many of them are not killed or even attacked, and most of them do not do much, the twists are too unpredictable to work well, and it is maybe too short. Now the good stuff- each performance is good, though the Killer (s) is (are) too over the top. Neve is excellent again, and i'm not only saying that because i'm a fan, but she has grown as an actress now coping with the fame Scream brought her, ironically mirroring the fame Sydney gets from what happened in Woodsboro. The Arquettes are both very good, Randy is very funny again, and the scares are pretty good. The police car scene stands out. Again the film deals with mistrust and uncertainty, like most of Craven's films, and we sympathies with Sydney's struggles- it seems inevitable that she will never put these events behind her, and that it will be a great struggle for her to get close to anyone- her relationship with her new boyfriend shows this (played brilliantly by O-Connell). The script is sharp, and there are many in-jokes. Overall it is a good film, but a continuation a story because the impact the characters of the first film had was so big, we had to see how they would move on. It cannot be as original or fresh (grr) as the first film, but that does not matter, that's not the point. 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,25 November 2004
Bram Stoker's Dracula," quick reviews!
","The second of the literal horror movies from the nineties on my top 150 list, Dracula is a success because of the chemistry between Oldman and Ryder, two of the most versatile actors around. Of the billions of stories told about Dracula, this one looks the most authentic, although, like most others, it strays from the text to suit its own desires. Reeves is not the greatest choice for Jonathan, but the rest of the cast are perfect, including Hopkins as the enthusiastic Van Helsing, and Tom Waits as Renfield. Gory in parts, with sublime dialogue, the only let down may be that the whole romantic angle is taken too far, that we may feel too much sympathy towards Dracula. The final few scenes are stand outs.",8,1,1,23 May 2004
Jaws," Quick Reviews!!
","The film that truly launched Spielberg into the public eye, a film which overachieves and overcomes the odds stacked heavily against it. A story about a seaside town attacked by a shark would not seem to be the basis for one of the most loved, respected and successful movies of all time, but Spielberg and the cast make it happen-scares excitement, laughs, good characters and great acting all contribute, along with fluid direction and a now infamous score. The budget was low, the filming at sea extremely troublesome, the shark wouldn't do what it was supposed to, but through all this the story prevails and we are left with a true classic.Scheider stars as Sheriff Brody, an ex-city cop with a fear of water who moves with his family to Amity, a popular sea-side holiday resort. There have been a number of deaths recently, and young shark expert Hooper comes to town to long at the bodies. He believes the deaths have been caused by a Great White Shark which will not leave the are while there is still plenty of food around. He advises Brody to close the beach, but the Mayor thinks it should be kept open for the July 4th weekend, the time when the town makes a real profit. When attacks continue, Brody and Hooper decide to track the shark and catch it. Local fisherman Quint who has met one or two sharks in his time also comes. The three set out on the tiny boat, and the shark soon finds them.There are scenes which have since become the stuff of legends- the opening night attack, the 'need a bigger boat' scene and others. The shark may look unreal now, especially as we all have a far better knowledge of sharks with all the documentaries and underwater technology. However, the tension is still high, and like Alien, we only see it near the end. The relationship between the three men on the boat, their arguments and jokes give the film a unique feel, ensuring the viewer is on the boat with them, and other touches such as Brody's son mimicking him are now a Spielberg staple. The death scenes are gruesome and real, thanks to the acting, and the score will is one of the best anyone has done, suiting the film perfectly. By the last few minutes, as the ship sinks, we are with Brody, waiting for the shark's inevitable return. Much has been made of the 'jumpy' moments, and every part of the film has since been dissected. It remains a film which everyone can enjoy, and one which will stay with you forever.10 out of 10",10,1,3,18 February 2005
The Lion King," Quick reviews!!
","Not only is it one of Disney's most loved films, it is one of the most successful movies of all time. A deceptively simple story, loosely built around Hamelet, with a rich cast of characters, a terrific list of voice actors, some extraordinary visuals and animation, and a few good songs make Lion King a favourite for many people, young and old.The Lion King tells the story of Simba, a young cub and heir to the throne. His father Mufassa tells him from Pride Rock that someday all that simba sees will be his, as he will be the 'King of the Jungle', at the top of the food chain. More than this though, adding the human element, Simba will be the leader of all the other animals and they will look to him for guidance. However Scar, Simba's uncle believes the throne should be his, that it would have been his had Simba not been born. Scar, as he is not the alpha male must live in inferior surroundings, and against the typical rules of society he befriends the Hyenas. He plots to usurp the throne. One normal day he takes Simba across the land and into a canyon, knowing that a stampede approaches. When he leaves, Mufassa rushes to help his son and is crushed. Simba survives however, but Scar tells him to leave as everyone will blame him for his father's death. Simba goes, Scar takes over, telling everyone Simba is dead. Soon Simba meets Timon and Pumba, mere-cat and Warthog, and they become friends, following the Hakuna Matata way of life. However, when an old friend Nala appears, Simba realises he must take back his throne and stop Scar, leading to a fiery confrontation.Each character here has depth and their own individuality. The voice acting for each is perfect, from the sneering intellectualism and jealousy of Jeremy Irons as Scar, to the wisdom and strength of Mufassa, played by James Earl Jones. The animation mixes computer styles with traditional, and the result is spectacular. From the sumptuous swirling views of the land, to the grimness of Scar's habitat, much akin to Shere-Khan's in The Jungle Book, everything is highly detailed. The songs range from the typical catchy dance numbers to ballads, and they are effective. The incidental music is often more powerful. The jokes are good for the most part, with many aimed at a more knowing, older audience, and while some scenes may be too harsh for younger viewers, it is still a perfect film for kids. There is love, friendship, respect and all the other traits of Disney, as well as the darker side too, which the kids will not recognise. A break from the fairy tale style of Disney films, and not a human in sight, but a major triumph for the studio, and a great, emotional, fun film.8.5 out of 10",8,1,2,21 March 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," good, not best.
","I can understand why this film is loved so much, but I can equally understand, although I do not agree, why it is despised. People say it is life affirming, brings hope and happiness, and it does, others say it is sentimental crap, and at times it is. But I've always been a sucker for sentimental movies, ones which have the power to genuinely move the viewer, and not hide under a cheap plot and a tragic death. Being another King adaptation, there is violence, and hardness to counteract the sentimentality, and the prison, although not as horrifying as those seen in Midnight Express and other movies, breaks the human soul to the point that it relies on the prison for survival. Heartbreaking, tear jerking, brutally funny, all phrases used repeatedly to describe this film, all appropriate. A film everyone should love. Great Quotes: Andy.

Platoon," one line?
","This is above Apocalypse Now on my top 150 list, because I've always felt it shows a wider range of emotions and characters, and perhaps it is easier to identify with the struggle each man feels. Every actor is effective, from the leads, to the smaller parts like that of Kevin Dillon; his Bunny is both funny and horrifying. Stand out images: obviously that of Defoe, arms stretched to the sky as the outstanding music soars, but one of my favourites is the post napalm scene, when the jungle changes colour. Brilliant. The movie goes straight for your throat, shocking you at every turn, and although you may feel desensitized to some extent by the end, the images of brutality will stay on. Think war is fun? Watch this.",9,2,5,19 May 2004
Scream," Quick Reviews!!
","Wes Craven proves he's a master of horror and innovation with Scream, over 10 years since his last smash A Nightmare on Elm Street. Craven had been a legend for 3 decades, but with this he made possibly his best known film, reinventing a dead genre for better and worse, making horror films profitable again. More importantly it gave horror fans something to cheer about, a smart, funny, sexy, but above all scary film.Scream's intro has already gone down in movie history as the benchmark of a shocking and effective way to start a film. Take an established actress, and eventually butcher her to set the tone. The phone, knife, shocks, inevitability of death, blood, helplessness, and a love of scary movies. Craven turns what we expect on its head, and we know we are in for something special. We are introduced to Sydney Prescott, a teenager whose mother was murdered a year ago, trying to get on with her life, coping with school, boyfriend, the court case involving Cotton who has been charged with her mother's murder, and intrusion from journalists. She has become strong through this ordeal, but is still vulnerable. Her boyfriend Billy wants sex, but won't push her as she is still a virgin. The news of the new murder comes as a shock to the whole town. Journalists flock in, including Gail Weathers who had accused Sydney of lies. In school the news spreads, and the cops question the students. Sydney's tight group of friends try to work out who it was, believing everyone's a suspect. Her friends are Tatum, feisty, strong whose boyfriend is like her, and Randy, movie nerd who secretly loves Sydney. When Sydney is attacked, it seems the killer is after her. Her father is supposedly out of town and cannot be found, a curfew is ordered and all the kids have a party. Soon the killer attacks, but who is it? This is clearly one of the best horror movies of the decade, not just an excuse for gore, but clever on many levels, and self-referential. It is more than that, being one of the best looks at teenage life in the last few years. The characters are extremely well drawn, taking stereotypes, but changing them against our expectations, enhanced by some brilliant performances. Every cast member performs well, with special mention to Randy, Arquette and Lillard. Cox is good, but Campbell is excellent, going through a myriad of emotions, proving that her character does not have to be stupid like most would typically be.Craven is in control, feeding us clues as to the identity of the killer, but ensuring that by the end we are surprised. Gore is used wonderfully, the scares and jokes are many, but it is the story of Sydney which makes it a classic. She is strong willed, smart, and we go through every emotion with her, aided by Neve's performance. We feel for her, but know we cannot help. The film is shot beautifully, the scenery stunning, an idyllic place to live, but with dark secrets. We get many close-ups of each character's face, Leone style, and we are hurt when one is killed, but become suspicious of each one. The script is sharp with many references to horror movies which the fan will try to recognise.Thematically we return to Elm Street territory. We must fight for ourselves in the world, and while our friends are the most important people in our lives, they may not be around forever and we must be able to cope with their loss. Parents are either not around, don't care, don't understand, or are to blame. Sydney's mum seems to be the catalyst for the deaths, the only authority figure to gain respect is Dewey, who isn't much older than the teens. The opening scene as Casey crawls towards her nearby parents, with the killer behind her highlights this, that the older generation will not always be able to keep us safe. The Headmaster, played by Henry Winkler hates kids, but he cannot organise or gain respect from them either.We are never certain of Gail's intentions, another point to do with the media's involvement in society today. Death has become trivialised, the victims just a ploy for ratings or power for those who tell the stories. Our thoughts on violence, on violent movies are challenged, Craven a veteran of criticism over use of violence. In the end it's up to us as individuals. The film shows that places we believed to be safe-our homes, and schools, have become dangerous places today too, that we are not safe anywhere. In a group, or by yourself, we are still vulnerable. The scene in the school toilets emphasises this point, and is another beautiful scene. However, the film teaches us that rather than being overcome by fear, by the fact that we are not always safe, we should fight.The death scenes and scary parts are memorable. My favourites- Sydney on her porch, staring over the hills, and the scene with Sydney, Billy and Gus's Don't Fear the Reaper playing in the background. It gives a perfect glimpse of what it is like to be in love at that age, and together with Campbell's beauty makes an odd atmosphere, especially when viewed again, having watched the other 2 films. We become intimate with Sydney, wishing we could save her from her pain.With the combination of genres subverted, a brilliant script and score, some excellent acting, good scares and jokes, Scream paved the way for a new breed of horror films, none of which, like Halloween and Elm Street, have matched it. We should be thankful for Craven, as he has provided the world with another film which should be watched and talked about as much as those felt to be the best movies of all time. This is certainly one of the best of our time.",10,15,18,21 February 2005
Halloween," Quick Reviews!
","Whether or not you feel, Excluding Psycho, that this was the first of its genre, it is definitely the most influential, for better or worse, and easily the most famous.A boy who killed his sister many years ago escapes from his asylum, and from the care of Dr. Loomis, the only person who remotely understands him, and decides to go on a kill crazy rampage in the town he was born, seeking and killing his relatives, and any other fool who gets in his way. So begins the legacy of Michael Myers. The film follows Laurie, dateless and forced to babysit on Halloween night, as she tries to escape Myers.While the plot is hardly outstanding, it is Carpenter's direction which makes this a classic. he knows how to create and build tension, and get the most from his cast, and for any wannabe directors this is essential viewing, as it was all done on a low budget. original camera angles, effective use of the hand-held, the score all help create the atmosphere that most modern horror movies cannot reach. Everything in this movie is designed around ensuring that the tension is unrelenting. this was also one of the first 'modern' movies that showed youth that the world was not as safe as they had been led to believe, that our parents are not as reliable or trustworthy as we thought. the scene where Laurie is turned away from a neighbors house by a simple flick of a light switch underlines this. 9 out of 10.",8,0,1,12 November 2004

","Like True Romance, released the same year, this movie has one of the best casts ever, and is more remarkable because everyone plays their parts extremely well without trying to out do one another. The film is about Wyatt Earp, the OK Corral etc, but focuses more on his relationship with his family and friends, including Doc Holiday, played by Val Kilmer who perhaps should have won the Oscar. The action scenes are all exceptional ,there is some awesome dialogue, Biehn and Russel are also worthy of nominations, and the film manages to evoke every emotion.

Blade Runner," overrated yes-good yes-Summary-no
","The most vivid depiction of the future ever captured on film. And do we want to be a part of it? Visually stunning, narratively engaging and rewarding, and worthy of repeated viewings to fully understand its depth.  This could almost be Travis Bickle's view of the future, as it bears a strong resemblance to his own New York (without the space-ships etc). The lack of constant, flowing action may turn off some people, but for the rest of us, the dialogue, the ideas, the plot, are enough to occupy our thoughts for the nights after watching it. Ford slouches through the film, effectively showing Decker to be more lifeless than the clones, but Hauer steals the film, in an impressively psychotic display, one he would perfect later in The Hitcher. If the plot confuses, the visuals will make it all better. Don't worry.",8,1,2,19 May 2004
Speed," Quick Reviews!!
","One of the last great action movies, fast moving, exciting, action packed, with good acting, Speed is still better than all the Summer blockbusters they try to feed us now. No-one is trying to destroy the world, we just have an old fashioned psycho who wants revenge. Dennis Hopper plays an ex bomb disposal guy who was chucked out of the force, and believes he deserves due payment. When his plan is stopped by Reeves, a reckless cop, and Bridges, his calm partner, Hopper decides to put Reeves through a series of tests. He puts a bomb on a bus, which will be armed if it goes above a certain speed, and then detonated if it goes below 50. Reeves begins a race to find the bus, stop the bomb, save the innocents and find the bad guy. On the bus he meets Sandra Bullock, Annie, who has to take over driving the bus when the driver is shot. They form a partnership and try to find the bad guy.It is clearly the stunts that are the selling point for the film, and they are superb. The action is directed well, and the good guys never seem to get a break, with every situation scraped through narrowly. Reeves is good, Bullock sparkles in her first big role, and Hopper does the mad thing brilliantly. The rest of the cast all perform well also. many memorable moments, and lots of fun, with a plot full of humour and tension.",9,2,4,16 December 2004
X2: X-Men United," quick reviews!
","It may well be the best action movie in five years, and definitely the best comic book conversion since Blade. I didn't enjoy Spiderman as much as I expected, and it has been VASTLY overrated since it's release, but I hope for better things in the sequel. Anyway, this continues where the first film ended, strangely enough, with Magneto in confinement, and the X-men struggling for political acceptance of mutants. But of course, Magneto escapes, and with the help of dodgy politicians, a war between mutants and mankind seems inevitable. For an action movie, where one would expect stunts etc to overthrow the plot, X-2 gives an excellent story, one we can relate increasingly to in today's messed up, but balancing world. I'm still waiting for Gambit, and The Beast, but that isn't too important when Wolverine and the others are kicking ass. Yes there are mistakes, but they are mostly insignificant, and when watching an action movie of this calibre, it's hard to care. The massive cast is faultless, with Paquin proving she can make the transition from child to adult actor without problems.9 out of 10",8,0,0,24 May 2004

What I don't appreciate is people condemning it because of its high rating. This is a beautiful, heart-warming movie, in a time when all we can think about is slaughtering each other, and having the freedom of speech to not give a sh*t about anyone. Like Marty, while everyone is making epics, or $200 million wastes of time, Amelie tells a simple tale without embarrassment, using all of the director's visual flare, and bringing together a great cast. Audrey Tautou is gorgeous, her smile infectious, and her performance worthy of many awards.

Final Destination," Quick Reviews!!
","Of the teen horror movies which appeared in the nineties most were dumb gore fests with cheap shocks and a sexy, young cast. However, there were 2 stand outs: Scream, of course, and Final Destination. Both are intelligent, with involving story lines, good characters, genuine shocks, and grisly deaths. While Scream was full of parodies and self-referential stuff, Final Destination played on our fear of death- the one thing which we all cannot avoid. While it does make jokes about itself and its genre, they are fewer than Scream, and do not go as over the top as some other films. The director fills every scene with real tension and fear, and successfully combines this with excellent set pieces and stunts, as well as sustaining a brilliant story. There are few films that can do this so we should admire Final Destination.128 students are planning to travel to France with their teachers for one last big school trip. However, the plane crashes, killing everyone on board. We then flash back and realise that it was the premonition of one of the students, Alex. He has been having a strange day, and when he sees that his premonition is coming true he tries to get everyone off the plane. Like a certain Twilight Zone episode he succeeds in only causing a minor panic and some embarrassment, and is thrown off the plane together with a few others who got involved. As they wait in the airport Alex relates what he saw and of course no one believes him. Suddenly the plane explodes, his premonition came true. In the aftermath, some of the survivors mourn, others see it as a second chance, the cops become interested in how Alex knew what was going to happen, and Alex has further visions. Soon the survivors are killed in bizarre ways, and the cops believe it is Alex. Alex thinks that death is stalking them because they cheated it, and he works out the order that they will die in, believing that if they can catch the visions and prevent themselves from dying again, they will be safe. This will not be easy though, as death can, and does strike from everywhere.The idea behind the story is excellent, and it is stylishly and effectively executed. It will appeal to the teen audience it is aimed at, but also older viewers as it is a very thought-provoking, existential film. This may sound a bit extreme, but apart from going back to watch Bergman movies, this is the perfect film. One character, Carter believes he is in control of his own life, not some invisible force, and at one point tries to prove this by parking on train tracks in front of an approaching train. Alex becomes increasingly paranoid, hiding in a hut from death, safe-proofing it in every way he can. Clear tries to be strong, has learnt to be this way through a tough childhood and cannot believe that all life is is a series of days avoiding death. The other survivors all have their individuality, and are not pastiches of other characters from teen movies. As well as this, the performances are each outstanding, even from Sean William Scott who proves he is more than capable of being Stiffler forever. The side plot of the cops believing Alex is behind the deaths adds a depth which most teen horror films do not have.Wong's direction is very stylish, and the deaths and set pieces are some of the most innovative ever, recalling the style of Argento, that everything is a potential killer. He also creates a massive amount of tension throughout, peaking with each death- the train and car scene will get the most flabby heart racing, the teacher in the kitchen is brilliantly staged within every fork and implement seeming deadly. The opening 15 minutes have to be among the most tense and exciting 15 minutes in movie history, confirming all those with a fear of flying to stay firmly on the ground. Though as you will see, the ground is far from safe. The film shows how we are not immortal, and without the humorous moments it might become too much. There are many famous shock moments, the bus scene being the best. Many have complained about this being stupid and unrealistic, but if death was stalking you, of course it would try to put the approaching bus under a veil of silence. It is beyond understanding that anyone could rate this a 1, but we can see why people may not like it. The premise may seem too far-fetched for people, but they seem to have forgotten that it is a fictitious horror film. Death here as a character does have a sense of humour, each death being ironic, gruesome or made to look like an accident, but this is all the more terrifying, that this force is coming after us for entertainment. Death wants immediate pay back for those who cheated it, but in the style of a Bond villain, likes to play with its victims first. Of course the deaths may seem impossible in the real world, but if it is Death stalking us, I think it has the power to bend a few rules. Most criticism of this film is petty and unexplained, meaning that the scoring of zero cannot be justified. For clever, shocking, exciting teen horror movies, there are very few better than this.9 out of 10",9,0,1,22 March 2005
Rear Window," Rear Window
","Hitchcock takes all the ingenuity of previous films like Rope and Lifeboat, and translates them to Rear Window, one of his true masterpieces. Taking place in one apartment where the viewer is forced to see what Jimmy Stewart's character sees, we are the voyeuristic witness to all the goings-ons of his neighbours. Frequently we look into their homes and become a passive viewer of their lives, wondering why they do what they do, what they will do next, and whether anyone can see us. Not only is it a technological treat, it is a pinnacle of tension and suspense, complemented by the twisting plot, excellent dialogue, and marvellous performances from all.Stewart plays LB Jefferies, or Jeff, a well travelled photographer who hates the idea of settling down, of being trapped in the same place for any length of time. Ironically he has broken his leg, and is forced to stay in a wheelchair, in his apartment for a few months. Through his boredom, and his window, he watches his neighbours and the daily actions, giving them nicknames because of their behaviour. There is Miss Torso, an amorous young dancer, the newly-weds who like to keep themselves to themselves, Miss Lonely Hearts who spends her days planning how to catch the attention of men, and spends her nights failing. There is a tormented pianist whose music fills the air, and couple and their annoying dog. Lastly there is Lars Thorwald and his wife who are often arguing. Lisa is Jeff's girlfriend, a socialite who wants the opposite of Jeff- marriage, new dresses, and a place in high society. Their nurse Stella also visits to add some humour and spark. Jeff becomes suspicious when Thorwald's wife disappears, and at night he sees Thorwald acting strangely; taking small packages wrapped in paper from his flat, going back and forwards. Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife, and with Stella and Lisa begins to try to prove what they believe to a detective friend. They search for a body, for evidence that Miss Thorwald is alive etc, and soon we too are captivated, wondering if she is dead, or if it is all just a mistake.The last 20 minutes of Rear Window must rank among the most suspenseful in movie history, and its influence can still be seen today even in modern horror movies such as Ringu. The voyeuristic qualities are impressive and effective, and we are truly brought into the room with Stewart. There is excitement, comedy, romance, mystery, all the trademarks of Hitchcock, all flawlessly shown. Kelly is beautiful and feisty, her entrance memorable, her character strong, and in the end we see that although she will succumb slightly to Jeff's needs, she will remain independent. Stewart is wonderful, giving yet another landmark performance conveying paranoia, annoyance and helplessness like few other actors can. Burr is frightening as Thorwald, and Ritter is extremely good as Thelma, adding much needed relief from the tension with tongue in cheek humour. Each of the neighbours is distinct and we come to understand them. Full of cynicism about people, love, romance and relationships, though not harsh, Rear Window is one of the great films of the 50's, and is still highly watchable and entertaining today.9 out of 10",9,4,7,23 March 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Quick Reviews!!
","The groundbreaking trilogy comes to a deservedly spectacular and breathtaking end as each character fulfils their individual destinies. The film starts with a flashback of Gollum's life- we see how he first came across the One Ring, murdering his friend, instantly captivated by its power. Eventually he becomes more deformed and monstrous, like Emperor Palpatine as the evil takes control of his being. Eventually he loses it, and immediately begins his search to reclaim his precious. Then we are pulled back into the present. Frodo, Sam and Gollum continue on their way to Mordor with Sam growing more and more suspicious of the creature, and Frodo becoming increasingly weary of his task. Gollum is of course leading them towards Shelob, a giant spider so that they will be killed and he can take the Ring. Meanwhile, Saruman has been defeated, and Gandalf meets up once again with Merry and Pip after their successful battles. However, those were tiny compared to what must come. Sauran's massive armies are heading for Gondor to destroy mankind, and Gandalf must try to convince Denethor to fight. He however is stubborn and mourns Boromir, turning his love away from Faramir. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli make their way with all of Rohan to try to support Gondor, recruiting all the warriors they can. Theoden will not help until Denethor calls him. The 3 friends travel into the darkness to summon an army of the dead who will only follow the rightful King of Gondor- Aragorn. The war begins, and hopefully the 2 hobbits can make to Mount Doom, avoiding Gollum's treachery and Sauron's minions, and destroy the Ring. But Frodo is losing his grasp on reality and Shelob is waiting.The battle scenes here are the most epic, best filmed, and exciting ever created, the effects remain stunning, and everything is as beautiful or horrible as always, depending on the place. The performances again are flawless, from the old and new characters, and the dialogue is full of quotable and inspiring lines. We now feel part of the actions of all the characters, exhausted by the travelling and feel a sense of fulfilment when Frodo reaches Doom. Everything finishes the way it should, and although there are some differences from the books, they do not matter. The final scenes in Gondor, of the King and everyone else bowing to the hobbits is heart-wrenching but not sentimental, and one of the best scenes in the trilogy. There is sadness, humour, fear and of course action, and it is all directed with a love and attention which is rarely seen. Every single person who worked on the films should be commended. It deservedly sweeped the Oscars like the other two should have done, and it is unlikely we will see a better series of epics again, until someone decides to do The Illiad, Aeneid and Odyssey properly. Perhaps those would be too great a task. We are left with the best films of our time and could not ask for anything more. Maybe a few zombies.10 out of 10",10,1,3,14 April 2005
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Quick Reviews!!
","In 1984 Wes Craven redefined the horror movie forever, bringing his own rules to the game, avoiding the clichés that had gone before, making an exciting, inventive, gory, wickedly clever, and above all-scary film. A Nightmare On Elm Street, spawner of sequels, influencer of crap is the movie horror fans hoped for in the early eighties, but is also an effective satire on small town life, our fascination with serial killers, our fear of the unknown, and the sins of our forefathers.Nancy is a 14 year old. She has a cute boyfriend who would do anything for her, and two friends who mock them by being...experienced. Nancy lives with her alcoholic mother in a large house, her father is the local Sheriff, they divorced a while ago. One night when the four friends are staying together, Tina is brutally murdered by a hideously disfigured man, seemingly in her dreams. Her boyfriend watches on, horrified, while Nancy hears the screams from outside. Rod flees, and the cops look for him believing he is the only possible killer. However, once caught Nancy becomes convinced that someone else killed Tina, a man named Fred Krueger. Later Rod dies in his cell, it is believed to be suicide but Nancy knows differently. Her mother becomes increasingly estranged, as Nancy does all she can to stay awake, knowing that if she sleeps she may die. Her mother takes her to psychiatrists as she doesn't know what to do, not knowing that everything she is doing is wrong. She goes so far as barring Nancy inside the house, and she can't see Glen her boyfriend. Nancy believes Glen is next. Upon investigation Nancy finds out Krueger's story- he was a child murderer who stalked the town a few years ago. He was caught but escaped unpunished by some loophole, so the residents took the law into their own hands, burning and killing Fred. However, now he is back for revenge by killing the children of Elm Street once again in their dreams, where they should be safe. Nancy thinks that she can bring Fred into the real world and stop him, but needs Glen to stay awake. However, Glen's parents think she is a maniac and take the phone off the hook. Glen is killed and his parents are clueless. It is up to Nancy to stop Krueger, hoping her father will be ready when she screams for him. So she lets herself sleep, and looks for Fred.This is one of the most imaginative horror movies ever, blending dreams with reality so the viewer never knows whether a character is asleep or not, giving a sense of tension throughout. Craven uses all the force which caused his previous films to be censored and banned, but makes his themes more subtle, and substitutes the realistic and grim visuals of The Last House on the Left for the fantastical sights here. For the most part it is the fault of the parents that their kids are killed- they created the monster by trying to kill the monster, but more importantly they then feel like their job has been completed, not realising when their kids are in danger. There is a total lack of understanding between the two generations, and little trust in the abilities of the youth. It is not only a tale for those reaching adulthood to be afraid of the world, that in the end we have to rely on ourselves rather than those who have protected us, but it is a story about the older generation's fear of the next generation. They want to be leaders but have their own insecurities, they want to be respected but show little in return, they want to protect but cannot see when something is really wrong.The young cast is good, particularly Langenkamp. Garcia and Wyss have little to do, Depp has a bigger role and shows some of what would make him a legend. It is Langenkamp who carries the film, and she is excellent in her portrayal of fear, paranoia and helplessness, all the things we face when we are teens. We forget though that these things rarely leave us. She screams, but thinks, and is not the typical stupid teen, making an assertive step towards saving herself and her friends, while trying to hold her family together. Indeed she proves to be the strongest character in the film, preceding Ripley by a few years. She knows her survival is down to herself. The older members are also very good. Blakley is brilliant as Marge who cannot cope with Nancy and with her break-up, giving in to booze like so many others. Saxon is also good as the father trying to get on with his life and work, and forget the evils of his past while trying to understand his daughter. And of course, Englund steals every scene he is in. He is terrifyingly believable, the perfect example of what lurks in our nightmares, waking and dreaming. His one-liners are comic to himself as he takes sadistic joy in following and killing kids. In later films they become silly, but here we get the sense that these are the exact words that would come from a paedophile and serial killer.The effects here also standout, with the famous bloodbath bed scene and Tina being torn all over the ceiling becoming some of the most famous images in horror history. Kreuger looks scary, those blades will be heard in our dreams, and the dream world is filmed with care so that we can tell that there is something not quite right about the surroundings, unsettling us. A highly effective film, scary and at times funny, but thought-provoking and unnerving with one of the most frightening villains ever committed to film. This inspired many clones, but this is still the king and continues to influence many films, horror and beyond. And count the number of Simpsons references.10 out of 10",10,0,0,13 April 2005
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Quick Reviews!!
","Another great, innocent eighties teen movie about rock, hope, the future, the past, the present, babes etc. As i've said before in other reviews it makes rock fans seem dumb, these two are, but it is a comedy and wouldn't work if they weren't. The idea that the future depends on these two is not as far-fetched as you would think- who honestly thinks politics and suit wearers can save the world? Anyway, the film is simply about friendship and trying to do something worthwhile in your life, that even a high school nobody can make a difference. Hardly original ideas, but given a totally excellent twist for the genre.Bill and Ted are two typical high school losers from San Dimas. They love their rock music, dream of being in a band and meeting some radical babes. Reality states otherwise- that exams are approaching and if they fail, it's off to military school. AS they believe that Joan of Arc was Noah's wife, their prospects of passing their history final are not good. One night, hanging around the Circle K, they meet themselves-from the future, and a guy named Rufus. He tells them they must pass their exam or there will be grave consequences for the world. They must travel back in time to find historical figures to bring back for their exam, travelling in a phone booth of course. On the way the fall in love, meet many people and get into a few scrapes. Soon though, their historical figures run riot in a local mall and get arrested. Time is running out- but they have a time machine...A silly idea, but very cleverly executed, and the result is much smarter than you might expect. Keanu and Alex are both excellent in their roles, and the rest of the cast are all very good. Special mention to Terry Camilleri who is very funny as Napolean. He gets some of the best lines-'Le Glace?' and 'Idiot!' amongst others. There are many one-liners, the film creating an inane language of its own which is both repeatable and harmless. The plot does fly all over the place, but it remains easy, and deals with the concept of time-travel much like Back to the Future did. There are many references which rock fans will get, modern audiences may not understand half the film now and will no doubt see it as extremely cheesy. The dialogue and fashion may have dated to some extent, but so will all today's teen shows and movies. This however retains charm over the years, and is still cool. There are many interesting ideas here, some very funny moments, and is more original than many would admit. Good solid entertainment, executed with a unique style.9 out of 10",9,0,0,22 February 2005
The Matrix," Quick Reviews!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Many people on this site have this as either their favourite film, or claim that it is the best movie ever made, while others completely loath it. The simple answer is that it is a superior action movie combining great effects with a plot which left the opportunity for so much more. Easily one of the most influential movies of recent times, at least when dealing with effects, but it takes most of its ideas from past films such as The Terminator films. What matters is not the basic philosophy speeches, destined to be repeated by fans, but that it is an enjoyable movie in many ways, looks awesome, and has lots of memorable moments and set pieces. Perhaps if the sequels had been better, this could rightfully be seen as one of the best movies ever. Either way, it is still one of my favourites.The film tells of Thomas Anderson, a man with two lives- his day job, and his life as a hacker known as Neo. He is caught by a group of agents who tell him he can live his normal life, or die. As time passes he meets Morpheus who explains that the world Neo has been living in is a false world created by machines to keep humans in order. The real world has all but been destroyed in a human and machine war. Morpheus believes that Neo is the chosen one, the one who will free mankind from slavery. At first it seems that this is not true, but as the film progresses, we see that Neo is not like the other humans- he can do things they cannot do.The Matrix is one of the most clever action films ever, the philosophising can become extremely annoying till the point that you realize a world of philosophers would not be very difficult to conquer. However, it all sounds cool, and there is truth in it, but then again, what is truth? Sigh. The effects are genuinely revolutionary, the performances are all good, especially from Weaving as Agent Smith whose monologue on the pointlessness of the human race is perfectly understandable, but at the same time pinpoints the exact reason for our existence. But that's not for me to say. The film has a good soundtrack, excellent fight scenes, and there is at least one memorable or iconic image every ten minutes. Not the greatest movie ever, but easily one of the best of its kind, and has its rightful place in cinematic history.8 out of 10",8,1,2,6 December 2004
The Great Escape," Quick Reviews!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Exciting, funny, tragic, with a massive cast who all perform brilliantly, providing many memorable moments, The Great Escape as everyone knows tells the story of the attempted escape of allied troops from German imprisonment. The characters are all well drawn, both Allies and Nazis, and each has a distinct personality, though McQueen's stands out. Even though only a few escape this is still a story of hope to rival The Shawshank Redemption. Memorable scenes are obvious: Steve's biking, Pleasance's tragic end, the celebrations which end in death, the 'get out and stretch your legs' scene, and the train station scene. With beautiful cinematography and a rousing score, this is a favourite for many people-it's shown here every Christmas. Interesting in that this is one of the few films i can think of which has no female character of note. 9 out of 10",10,16,22,16 November 2004
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Quick Reviews!!
","By far the best Vampire movie of the decade, and probably the best in the last fifty years. Until someone makes I Am Legend properly, it will probably remain that way. Neil Jordan, famous for dark films, tone-wise, and light-wise directs this, giving probably his best film, and bringing out several brilliant performances from both well known, and unknown actors.Brad Pitt stars as Louis, a vampire who decides to tell his epic life and death story to a modern day journalist, played by Christian Slater. Louis tells of his conversion to Vampirism by Lestat, a maniacal vampire played by Tom Cruise. He tells of his struggle to truly convert as he does not want to take a human life, but when he finds a young girl alone on a street, he turns her, and the couple raise her as their daughter. As years and decades pass, the friction between Louis and Lestat grows, and he eventually fights Lestat, leaving him for dead, and fleeing with Claudia, with whom he has become extremely close. They find a group of Vampires who wish them to join, but in a twist Claudia is killed and Louis is left alone. As we get close to present day, Louis again meets Lestat, and decides to tell his story.Much of the film's best points are when Dunst is on-screen, as she gives one of the best child performances ever. The family dynamic provides many laughs, but is in reality a ploy to build up for the emotion shock of her death. Natuarlly this is not a bad thing, as we are genuinely saddened by her death. Pitt is sympathetic, Cruise gives one of, if not the best performance of his career, and the rest of the cast are all good. The sets are both exquisite and horrifying, there is plenty of gore, and the story is extremely involving. This is how 'traditional' vampire films should be made in the 'modern' era. 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,29 January 2005
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Quick Reviews!!
","Probably my favourite MP film, maybe because it was the first i saw. They were showing this recently in my Student Union bar, i was sitting with a group of fans and non-fans. the fans were laughing and quoting, and the others sat there asking why it was funny. There's the problem and the Genius of Monty Python-some get it, some don't. It's unconventional, chaotic, hilarious, but there's no point explaining to those who don't get it, as if you don't when you first see it, you never will. So many funny scenes and one liners, my favourites being the white rabbit scene, and the bridge/3 questions scene. And the Black night. Everything about this film is funny, from the acting and dialogue to the cheap production and unexpected ending. 8 out of 10",9,1,3,19 November 2004
True Romance," Quick Reviews!!
","At the height of Tarantino's fame, everyone wanted a piece, so this was made, adapted from a script of his. Featuring one of the best casts ever, with old and new stars coming together in a pulp world to tell a modern story of love, True Romance is one of the best cult movies of the nineties. Slater plays a loner, a young'un with a love for comics and old kung-fu movies who meets, and sleeps with a beautiful young woman one stormy night. He learns that she came to him as part of a set-up, (his boss thought he needed to get laid) but they soon fall in love and get married. After a run in with her pimp, they find themselves with a case of coke, and on the run, and so begins a series of superb cameos, and great set pieces all filled with witty dialogue.The soundtrack and acting are excellent, as is to be expected, and the dialogue is just as quotable as that of Pulp Fiction. Perhaps superior to PF in that we want the lead characters to succeed, as they are not just cool, but manage not to be scumbags. The alternative ending is good also, on the DVD. Definitely a movie for serious movie fans, or at least movies of this type.",9,4,8,10 December 2004
Back to the Future," Quick Reviews!!
","Probably the best time-travel movie ever made, successful because it appeals to all ages- it has so much action and humour that all kids will be entertained, and the concept of time travelling is not dumbed down for the adults. The incredibly complex plot, made all the more incredible when considering that it spreads over the course of three films, but that each film has individuality.Michael J. Fox cemented his name in history by his performance here as school kid Marty McFly, a wannabe musician who befriends local wacky scientist Doc McCloud, played exceptionally be Christopher Lloyd. The Doc has created a time machine in the form of a De Lorean car. However, when the Doc is murdered, it is up to Marty to ravel back in time to prevent the murder. Marty goes back to the fifties- to the time when his mum and dad were in school together, but in a great twist Marty's mum falls for him, so he has to figure out how to get his mum and dad together or he will never be born. Many more twists ensue with frantic pace until Marty eventually attempts to get back to the future.The action is fast, the sets and costumes are excellent, the famous theme tune is rousing, and there are many memorable moments. It is definitely a film for fans of 80's nostalgia, but it is one of those rare films which can be clearly recognised as being made in the 80's without looking remotely cheesy. On the contrary, everything about the film remains cool to this day. Every performance is worthy of mentioning, from McFly's eternal bully Biff, to Marty's young, geeky father. A film which should delight everyone, and another which i find difficult to fault. 10 out of 10",10,1,2,29 January 2005
Goodfellas," Quick Reviews!
","Possible SPOILERS!i saw this before i'd seen Godfather 2+3, and is more of a personal favourite largely because of Pesci's performance. he manages to be both scary and funny, but what is special is that we feel both relief and sadness when he is killed. Brasco also gives a dual performance, changing from feisty single girl to terrified, paranoid housewife with great ease. as always De Niro is on top form, and Liotta manages to give 3 distinct personalities-his own, Conway's and Tommy's.Each of the characters falls from grace effectively, with Henry becoming what he always dreaded at the end, a suburban nobody. the violence is tense and bloody, the plot gripping, if not complex, making it easily one of the best films of the nineties. filled with memorable images and dialogue. 9 out of 10",8,2,5,11 November 2004
The Birds," quick reviews!
","SPOILERS!!!Hitchcock does it again, by taking a seemingly preposterous situation, and turning it into one of the most impressive, intelligent, tense, and image filled horror movies ever. Tippi has often been accused of not being the greatest actress, but in this she is suitably mysterious as the outsider, at the same time seductive and vulnerable. One look at Jessica Tandy's face is enough to show the viewer that this woman is not wanted in their cosy town. For reasons unknown, Melanie Daniels's arrival heralds the attack of countless birds, ending in death and chaos. It is often assumed that the birds come as a warning about overt female sexuality, as Melanie travels to Bodega to get it on' with Mitch Brenner (Taylor). Whatever the reason, what ensues is a gripping finale as the remaining townsfolk hide in their house, wondering when the next attack will be. The scene in the café, as the town argues over whether a recent bird attack is real or fake, quickly followed by a full scale bird assault. We are ominously told that birds vastly outnumber people. While people fumble around, trying to escape incompetently, the birds of a different feather flock together (very sorry), and work as an unstoppable group. If you kill one, there's a thousand more. The stand out scenes are obvious; the birds gathering on the playground, the attack on the school children, the don't open that door scene', and the final scene, as the humans leave, defeated. The birds themselves are truly remarkable, again making CGI seem very very stupid. Perhaps too slow for some, especially those expecting a fully blown gore and shock fest, but for those who don't mind that kind of thing, it is superb.10 OUT OF 10",10,1,2,26 May 2004
Jurassic Park," Quick Reviews!!
","Breathtaking effects which brought tears to my eyes (and to the eyes of many palaeontologists too), excellent set pieces, action and stunts, non-stop fun in the typical Spielberg fashion, a brilliant score, good acting all round, many iconic images, and a good story make Jurassic Park one of the most exciting films of all time. Revolutionary because of the effects, many of which look light years better than those of today, the film is not just a typical summer blockbuster with effects overload, but a good story for all the family.For years Dr Hammond has been trying to make his dream come true- to bring back the most awesome creatures that have ever walked the earth- dinosaurs. Extinct for millions of years until now, when science has enabled us to bring back that which was once thought to be lost forever. The creatures of course cannot be trained and are extremely dangerous, but they are kept in check by the fact that only females are bred. Hammond is successful, and his idea to create a zoo for the animals needs recommendations. He invites Dr Alan and Dr Ellie, 2 dinosaur experts, and Jeff Goldblum part philosopher part scientist part comedian. His young nephew and niece also come along, as well as the man who will be financing the park. Hammond shows them how he created them, leading to debates on morality etc but what everyone really wants is a trip around the park. So they go. Of course, things soon go wrong when Dennis, a man working for Hammond decides to turn off the security. He is attempting to steal samples for the black market. Soon the dinosaurs are loose, and the group is fighting for their lives.Each character is brilliantly drawn, and well acted. As many have said, the effects are awesome, and look completely real. Only a few parts look dated now. CGI looks like the future here, along with T2, but has since went downhill. As a child i always had a fascination with dinosaurs, still do, and it has always been a dream to see them in the flesh. As that is unlikely, this is the closest any of us will get. The variety of creatures is good, and they all seem like they did in our imaginations. The action flows fluidly once it starts, and there are many jumpy moments. The first T-Rex attack has become part of our culture, but the tree descent, Raptor kitchen and chase are all equally spectacular and get your heart racing. Spielberg gets the charm going by splitting the central group, meaning we get to see the relationships between Sam Neill and the kids growing, as well as the banter between Goldblum and Dern. The deaths, naturally are pretty gruesome, but hardly over the top, but some parents may find them too scary for kids. Not even Samuel L. Jackson is spared. Most of the smaller characters are killed as the dinosaurs rampage, but we can be certain our group will be OK. It's that they are so nail-bitingly close to having their nails, heads, legs etc bitten that make it exciting. This is what Spielberg is best at.There is much depth in the film, many issues raised about cloning, right and wrong, nature etc, but these would bog down the film if they kept raising their heads. They are mentioned so they will be in our minds long after the excitement has finished, and when we are ready to talk about them. But i'll leave that to the smart people. What matters is that Spielberg has created another masterpiece, the monster movie he wanted to make years before with Jaws, but didn't have the budget or technology to do so. Make another one like this Spielberg, come one, we know you can.10 out of 10.",10,3,5,14 February 2005
Beetlejuice," QUICK REVIEWS!
","SPOILERS!!!I often ask myself what Johnny Depp would have been like as Beetlejuice, and whether he could have pulled it off at such a young age. Keaton, coming from a comedy background however, is perfect for the role, and I find difficulty in seeing who could have done a better job. While some of the effects look dated, ie. The sand snake, others still look pretty good. I'm sure most of you know the story, so I'll skip that, and say why this is a great film. It is very surreal, with some excellent dark comedy, and winning performances from Keaton and Ryder, and special mention going to Glenn Shadix as Otho. Davies is good as always, and Baldwin is ok, but watching Keaton skip about is the high point. Every line he has is gold, and delivered to perfection, and the most memorable scenes usually revolve around him. My favourite is probably the final, head-shrinking scene. The score, by Danny Elfman is also worthy of mentioning, and the make up team won an Oscar. Another rare treat.8 OUT OF 10",8,1,2,26 May 2004
Evil Dead II," Quick Reviews!!
","A favourite of horror and gore fans everywhere, and virtually a remake of the first film as Ash again finds himself trapped in a house in a solitary forest which becomes overrun with zombies and deadites. That Necromonicon is at it again! Campbell again steals the show, one of the most under-used and underrated actors around. Raimi keeps the film moving at a quick pace, and some of the camera work, including the chase shots through the house as doors explode off hinges, lots of strange POV shots etc etc show his flare as a director if not as a storyteller. But the main selling point is the gore, of which there is lots, and the set-pieces involving a flying eye and a possessed hand. Again the effects are good by today's standards-with today's technology, stop motion could be very effective. 8 out of 10",8,2,2,22 November 2004
The Godfather," Quick Reviews!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!What can be said that hasn't been said already? Is this the best movie ever? Along with the Seven Samurai and Vertigo i would say yes. The cast is massive, they all have a part to play, and all perform with excellence. The scope is huge, the direction flawless, the score is one of the best, lots of memorable images, lots of violence, and endless points of discussion. if i try to find faults, i would be picky, and the faults would be minor-the wedding scene at the start goes on for too long, with too much singing and dancing, but i can see what Coppola is doing. We get a genuine sense of the family, its home life and business life, with the female members pushed away so that the men can do what they think they have to do. My favourite images are Michael standing outside the hospital, pretending to hold a gun, the first time he sees Apollonia, McCluskey with a bullet in his head, and all the mob deaths at the end. 10 out of 10",10,1,4,22 November 2004
