Despicable Me 2," 10 out of 10
","If you haven't watched the first movie then don't worry I don't plan on spoiling anything but let me just say this, you'll love the character Gru (trust me) and you'll love him even more in this movie.This movie is absolutely hilarious, there's just so many things to laugh at and it's a good type of laugh.If you want a perfect movie that's suitable to watch with anyone whether it's family or friends, this is the pick you want.Despicable Me 2 definitely has definitely beaten the first movie of this. I absolutely recommend watching this. And for those of you who haven't watched the first movie, I urge you to go and watch it.10 out 10 Stars",10,1,2,31 August 2013
Tangled," Great family Comedy to watch
","I've watched pretty much a lot of animated movies and most of them are comedy genres. This particular movie is absolutely funny and is such an awesome fairy tail to make an animation of. Not only does it have cute moments I'm sure the girls will notice but it will also have both kids, teens and even adults of either gender going into giggle fits, and I say this from experience.If you're looking for something to watch with your family, friends or even with your partner, this is the perfect thing to watch to get a smile on your faces.I absolutely recommend watching this. I give this a total of 10 out of 10 stars.",10,23,26,31 August 2013
