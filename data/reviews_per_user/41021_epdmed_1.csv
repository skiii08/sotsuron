Sucker Punch," A girl uses her dreams and elaborate fantasies to escape the reality she is living in-a mental institution. What part is dream and what part is fantasy?
","I am an avid movie fan, and there are some wonderful actors in this movie. I do not know how to explain why or how this movie is so awful. I just found my nose crinkling and yawning and fast forwarding so much. I know some people liked it a lot, but I found this film, how shall I say...hokey? I felt like I was watching a video game the whole time. And I don't play video games.Although there are some good actors in this film, I did not like their acting in it.It may have something to do with the directing? There was a lot of over acting. I loved the music, but it did not help the movie be any easier to watch.It is true, I did question myself why? Why does this movie get on my nerves so much? I wanted to like it. I love loony bin movies, but this, was just too much. There are some very elaborate CGI, but that may have been part of my problem with this film. I can say that it was beautiful, but that is what made me think of a video game. During the scenes involving them, the CGI took over and replaced actors. It was like they were trying to save their budget by doing this. It did not do well at the box office, and it barely broke even. I am old school, and I do not like graphics to replace actors. Although talent on the graphic engineer's side, it is weak everywhere else. So, the only good things I can say about the movie is the soundtrack, which features the lead actress, Emily Browning,singing on quite a few tracks and the CGI, although not the artist's fault who was hired to do the CGI, it made me like the movie less, as I said earlier, I found it hokey. Weak production values andbad acting. I could not sit through it again.",2,0,5,1 April 2012
