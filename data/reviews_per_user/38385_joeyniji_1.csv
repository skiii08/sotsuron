Miracle," review
","this past tuesday (jan 20) i was fortunate enough to catch a 'press screening' of this film. if you are a hockey fan you must see this movie! it doesnt matter if you're american/canadian/russian/czechoslovakian /communist/fascist/democrat or republican. this movie will still hit home with you because it deals with dedication, hard work, teamwork and the determination it takes to achieve something worthwhile.the ensemble cast is solid! kurt russell deserves a nomination for best actor for his excellent portrayal of the great herb brooks (coach of the miracle 1980 gold metal hockey team)!!!on the content of the film it is rated PG. it seems that PG is not what it used to be. these days its almost impossible to actually take a kid to a PG film without being embarrassed (even some of the disney animated films are questionable). when we went to see `the cat in the hat' i was sinking  in my seat (because there were a lot of children present) as all the innuendos and crass behavior passed for humor (thank god our kids werent with us). . but i must give kudos to disney for this film! as i think back i cant remember if i even heard an actual swear word (a 4 letter expletive). there was no sexuality other than a loving kiss here and there between herb and his wife. the only reason i see to even give it the PG rating is for the inherent violence of the game itself. there arent many films that can truly be called a family film but this just might be one of them.if you were old enough to actually remember watching the game you will be magically taken back in a time machine to where you were at that moment (and you will especially be touched)!anyone else who has ever wanted to do something that seemed impossible should go see this movie!on february 6, 2004 you will believe!!!",Null,0,0,23 January 2004
