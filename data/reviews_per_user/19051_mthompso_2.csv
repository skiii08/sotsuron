Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Visually impressive, otherwise hollow
","Gotta say I'm very disappointed. The story was thin, at best. A dispute over trade routes? Geez, that's C-SPAN material. The acting was awful, the (human) characters bland, and the pace of the movie was very rushed. From scene to irrelevant/drawn-out scene, one watches this film without ever being connected to it. Emotionally empty, this film was never more than a series of action sequences.",5,0,1,7 June 1999
The Waterboy," Speechless
","Can someone please explain how this film could be described as a comedy? I was able to see this crap for free and I feel ripped off. Why did this movie pull in $150 million? Are our expectations of entertainment so low that we'll settle for films such as 'The Waterboy'. I have no problem with 'low-brow' comedy, in fact 'Caddyshack', 'Animal House' and 'Stripes' are 3 of my favourites. But I have a hard time believing that anyone with any sense of humour or wit could have found this to be anymore than a waste of time. Awful - 1/10",1,3,7,29 July 1999
