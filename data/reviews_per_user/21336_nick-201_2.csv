Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great special effects,bad story
","Well,I had read a lot about,and heard from other people about how annoying JarJar Binks was,and I guess I'd have to agree,I think most of 'his' scenes could have been clipped out,and the movie would have improved quite a bit.The special effects were great,I have no complaints,but it was way too 'kiddyfied' for me.The original SW and Return were pushing it pretty close.Lucas should have modeled the new film on the Empire Strikes Back,It wasn't too much one way or another,It brought balance to the force!Hopefully,the next one will get it right...",6,0,1,29 May 1999
Aliens," Nearly a perfect movie!
","This is probably my favorite movie, period. Just about everything is perfect, the cast, the storyline, the effects (except the guys in the rubber suits in the 'tunnels'). My only real squawk is the music that James Horner ripped off (from himself!!) from Star Trek II, The wrath of Khan! When the 'vehicle'is running around, it's the same music as the battle scenes in ST2TWOK! This movie shows how sci-fi/action should and could be done, and everytime I think about it, I think of what Jurassic Park could have been with Cameron directing/writing, and given a Titanic budget! If it would have been done half as well as the book, it would have been one of the all time greats. If you never read the book, do it, and see if I'm wrong.....",10,5,6,24 April 1999
