Lucky Number Slevin," Amazing indeed
","It's just...so perfect...it start's a little bit funny and keeps going like that and it ends dramatic, I saw hundred of movies and I didn't expect that. I think the movie is made in such a matter that it keeps you wondering what is going to be next and makes you forget about the little things: why did he kill the dumb guy when he was a professional killer? why when the gun was pointed to the kid's head it showed the bloddy house's background? why don't things add up?it's at half...who is the real Slevin?and so on...it is so absorbing that makes you forget...and I usually anticipate a lot. I think Slevin was given a role that is really matching with Bruce Willis's roles in other movies...ironic, funny and bad...especially tricky. All in one...what a hit. And where do we put that the Kansas City Shuffle was on us this whole time! Hat's off to the producer.",10,0,9,18 May 2006
The Da Vinci Code," I liked the book more
","They had the chance to make this movie more better, and they didn't.This movie is interesting but there is no intrigue, the actors, and they are great actors, played poorly in this movie...with a lack of reaction...and...it was kinda boring...like I said...the book was more great.Some effects were nice, the myth was good...actually I get a message that my comment does not contain enough lines :)) because the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text...but I don't have anything else to say about this movie, sorry...there's nothing else...Hmm...so....how is everybody?...any chance to change this rule about the 10 minimum length for comments?...",5,1,4,25 May 2006
