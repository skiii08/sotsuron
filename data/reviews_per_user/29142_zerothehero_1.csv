The Blair Witch Project," An acceptable movie, not so original,though.
","This is the kind of movie people'll love or hate - look at the rate distribution please: so many 10 and 1 ratings equally balanced - IMO, it is an acceptable movie, scary enough, still the idea of using victims' tapes to flashback the plot is not new: Ruggero Deodato with 'Cannibal Holocaust' did a better job in this respect. I rate 6/10",6,0,1,10 January 2004
