Watchmen," Who should be watching the watchmen?
","Who is watching the Watchmen? I suppose the question I'm really asking is: who should be watching the watchmen? I went last night for a late showing (first bad move) & with my girlfriend (second bad move) – My favorite quote from Felicia, whilst sprawling across the seats in a fit of despair, was 'Oh no do we still have a whole war to go in Antarctica'. The film started in style, a montage of highly saturated, slow-mo, graphic novel images set the scene, dropping us into the mid 80's, this set to a classic Dillon tune made me sit comfortably back in my chair. The comfort factor didn't last long the comedy both spoof/dark were interspersed with hard core violence & teasing taboos. So is there a need for masked vigilantes? Are super heroes 'super' or 'heroic'? Did Rorschach get it right? I enjoyed this film it may be suitable for those with a darker sense of humour, & those with a penchant for 'tools & body combinations' e.g. head & meat cleaver, circular saw & arms you get my driftPro's: i. Soundtrack: (Dillon, 99 Red balloons, Simon & Garfunkle, Hendrix & surely the best use of Leonard Cowen tune used in film to date!)ii. Rorschach iii. Lomoesque colours iv. Malin AkermanCon's: i. The numerous blue phallus shots? ii.The lack of editing (It felt like I was watching the extended version of the film – huge chunks could easily have been left out without detriment to the film - sorry graphic novel fans). iii.Film length – very very long.",8,0,4,1 July 2010
The Matrix Revolutions," Lacks the ingenuity and breakthrough qualities of the original
","'Smile at the camera and say CHEESE.' Were these the directions of the Wachowski brothers? I found that romantic gestures and apparent lines of sincerity were so unbelievable that I spent half of the film giggling! This film lacked the ingenuity and breakthrough qualities of the original Matrix leaving it simply an action film rather than continuing with its ability to mentally stimulate the audience. The films ending was given away prematurely by the Oracle's hint to Neo, as an audience we want to think for ourselves, for example,did they really need to say that agent Smith is Neo's opposite? Oh... I'd never of known! I never thought that I'd say this but I wish that the matrix had never evolved into a trilogy, the first film was and will remain a classic. However saying that I still want a go in one of those ridiculous APU's, did they remind you of anything from the film Aliens?KID: But sir i haven't finished my APU training!!! MIFUNE: Neither did I.",5,1,1,1 July 2010
District 9," If you don't like it your a fooken prawn!
","District 9 I had an evening to kill in Kuala Lumpur before my flight home. I was hot, the air was humid, full of food I retreated to the haven of the air conditioned cinema where a purchased a ticket to the next film.... District 9.Having avoided the trailers & hype for this film i was a blank canvas & was surprised as a spoof documentary followed the promotion of an unlikely character (Wikus Van De Merwe) in a munitions corporation in South Africa. The humour & originality prove excellent from the very start.Set in the third decade following alien (aka The Prawns) contact with earth, interspecies relations are tense - stranded aliens are seen to be a burden on humans their unusual habits force segregation.'District 9' a Prawn containment shanty town in Johannesburg, is set to be evicted by a militarised team headed by the newly appointed lead Wikus. All is going well until Wikus comes into contact with a secret alien chemical... From here on in the story spirals through a whirlwind of love, comradeship, torture & self sacrifice set in an alien apartheid.An excellent film, wonderfully put together it lifts you with comic highs & then drags you down with moments of terror. Entertaining & thought provoking I really do recommend a viewing.Great film. If you don't like it your a fooken prawn!(Apartheid echos of the alien plight can be seen during film production. District 9 was not a constructed set, it was a previously residential governmental eviction zone - the people moved on to better government housing.)",9,1,8,2 July 2010
