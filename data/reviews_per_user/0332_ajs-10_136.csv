The King's Speech," Most excellent!
","I always like a film based on true events, it seems that real life has just as many amazing stories as pure fiction. This is a case in point. A man who stammers has to rise above his affliction, with the help and support of those around him, to speak for a nation. It's quite a remarkable film. Here's a short summary first before I give you my thoughts (summary haters please wait outside while I get through the next speech sorry, paragraph).King George VI, known as Bertie to his friends and family, was not born to be king. That honour went to his older brother David, or King Edward VIII, after their father George V passed away. Unfortunately, David finds he cannot carry out his duties due to events in his private life (quite a scandal actually) and so Bertie has to step in. A long time before this he had started seeing an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel Logue. He had always stammered and found it particularly hard to speak in public. With the help and support of Logue, his wife, Elizabeth and his daughters another Elizabeth (later to become Queen Elizabeth II) and Margaret; this film depicts how he overcame his problems to give a very important speech live on the radio to the entire British Empire (as it was then) just after the outbreak of World War II. It also gives an insight into the reasons for Edward's abdication and the effect it has on the nation. But I think that's enough summary for now.I found this a totally engaging film from start to finish. As a Brit, I was taught about the abdication of Edward VII in school, but I never knew about George VI's stammer or the work of Lionel Logue. Of course, the film is most noted for the performance of Colin Firth as King George VI (Bertie to his friends), which is totally justified, he is outstanding! Also worthy of note are both Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue and Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth. Honourable mentions go to Derek Jacobi as Archbishop Cosmo Lang, Michael Gambon as King George V, Guy Pearce as King Edward VIII, Claire Bloom as Queen Mary and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill.Apart from the performances, I thought it was an excellent screenplay by David Seidler. Nicely directed by Tom Hooper, it depicts the period perfectly. This is a film with many laughs, more than a lot of modern 'comedies', IMO, which serve to lift the mood of what is, after all, rather serious events in world history. Over all, brilliant performances, a great story and a few laughs along the way who could ask for more? Very highly recommended.My score: 9.3/10",9,0,1,22 January 2011
Whip It," A little rough around the edges, but still, pretty good...
","I have been wanting to see this one for a while; I was interested to see just how Drew Barrymore's directorial debut would turn out. Not too bad is the answer, a little rough around the edges, but not a bad first effort all in all. It's entertaining, very funny, in places, and I found it a laudable effort. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please lace up those skates while I write the next paragraph).Bliss Cavendar is a teenage girl living in Bodeen, a small town in Texas. Her mother, Brooke, encourages her to take part in beauty pageants, but you can tell her heart isn't really in it. She works at a diner with her friend Pash and one night they decide to go out to a Roller Derby in Austin. They discover the team are having try-outs and so Bliss decides to give it a go. She's under age and so tells them that she's 21. At first, she's not very good, but with practice she gets better. Of course she has to lie to her parents about where she's going and what she's doing. All the players have pseudonyms and Bliss chooses 'Babe Ruthless' as her moniker. She eventually gets good enough to take part in a match and, after a baptism of fire, she soon finds her feet. Their coach, Razor, discovers that Bliss is a very good player; she's small, agile and can score them lots of points If only he could get them to use his play-book! Eventually it comes down to the play-off game and Bliss must face her nemesis, Iron Maven. Add to this the turmoil at home and a love interest, a boy from a band, Oliver, (of course there's got to be a love story) and that's a potted version of the film. No more, or the Spoiler Police will be after me.I really enjoyed this one, yes, it's a bit rough around the edges, but you can see they had a lot of fun making it. The performances are all very good, especially Ellen Page as Bliss and Marcia Gay Harden as her mother Brooke Cavendar, both were very good. Both Kristen Wiig as Maggie Mayhem and Drew Barrymore as Smashley Simpson did a good job as Bliss's teammates. Also Juliette Lewis put in a good shift as Iron Maven. Honourable mentions go to Alia Shawkat as Pash, Jimmy Fallon as 'Hot Tub' Johnny Rocket, Andrew Wilson as Razor and Landon Pigg (great name!) as Oliver.Credit goes to all the stunt people, this must have been a tough one to pull off, but they did a very good job. I also enjoyed the soundtrack, some good tracks are used, mostly indie stuff, but if you include 'Sheena is a Punk Rocker' by The Ramones then you're always going to get my vote! It's not prefect, as I've already mentioned, but I did find it pretty entertaining, and so Recommended.My Score: 7.9/10",8,0,3,16 April 2011
Angels & Demons," An interesting adaptation.
","Having previously seen this at the cinema, I thought it might be interesting to give it a second viewing on the small screen.I had read the Dan Brown novel before seeing the film. There are a lot of differences between the two, but the main plot line of the book remains. The main difference being that the part of the Camerlengo, played by Ewan McGregor, is portrayed as an Irish man as opposed to an Italian in the book. I will try to not dwell too much on the differences between the novel and the film, so as to review the film as a stand-alone work. I must say though that Ron Howard is one of my favourite directors, having directed some of my all-time favourite films, including Cocoon (1985), A Beautiful Mind (2001) and the absolutely brilliant Apollo 13 (1995).The Pope has died and his successor is to be chosen from the conclave of assembled Cardinals. Four of their number, the preferred, have been kidnapped and the other Cardinals are unaware that a bomb, comprised of antimatter, has been hidden in the Vatican. Symbologist Robert Langdon is called in and he must decipher clues left the ancient group known as the Illuminati before the bomb goes off and the four kidnapped Cardinals are murdered. He has the help of beautiful physicist Vittoria Vetra, whose father was killed when the antimatter for the bomb was stolen and the head of the Swiss Guard, who protect the Vatican City, Commander Richter. There are many plot twists in this tale of treachery and revenge, as more clues are revealed and the Illuminati take retribution for centuries of persecution.This is an exciting thriller with some great action and a fast-moving plot. I thought the cinematography and the costumes were very well done. The setting is Rome and the Vatican City, although I have read that the Catholic Church banned filming in any church. Given that, the locations were excellent. The performances by all of the main characters were also excellent, Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, Ewan McGregor as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, Ayelet Zurer as Vittoria Vetra and Stellan Skarsgård as Commander Richter. Honourable mentions go to Pierfrancesco Favino as Inspector Olivetti and Nikolaj Lie Kaas as the Assassin. Over all, an enjoyable, fast-moving thriller which had a quite complicated plot, so you have to concentrate. I did find it a little long though at 138 minutes but still recommended.My score: 7/10",7,0,0,20 June 2010
Black Swan," Liked it even more on the second viewing!...
","I first saw this film at the cinema back in January and I was so impressed with it I decided to give it another viewing when it appeared in the TV schedules recently. I'm really glad I did as I enjoyed it even more second time around! I'll give you my (revised) of my thoughts after this brief summary.Young ballerina Nina Sayers has been chosen to play the lead in Swan Lake. The production's director, Thomas Leroy, has chosen her because she can play the white Swan perfectly, but he wants her to show more passion when she dances the part of the Black Swan. As she strives to achieve this level of performance we witness quite a dramatic change in her that totally alters her personality. She also has to contend with a rival dancer, Lily, who Thomas has put as her alternate (I guess the equivalent of an understudy in a play). Add to this the decline of Beth Macintyre, an experienced dancer that Nina admired and the attentions of her overbearing mother, Erica, and you can see she has a lot to contend with. I'll leave my brief summary there or the Spoiler Police will be after me with a crossbow again.There is much to admire in this film, Darren Aronofsky certainly knows how to get a performance out of his cast. He also knows how to tell a story, I couldn't fault the filmmaking; it's great to look at, all topped off with a great performance from Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers. Also worthy of note are; Mila Kunis as Lily, Vincent Cassel as Thomas Leroy, Barbara Hershey as Erica Sayers and Winona Ryder as Beth Macintyre.I very much like the use of music through this film; the iconic themes from Swan Lake are throughout and only add to the enjoyment of the piece. I love the way the line is blurred between reality and the dark place Nina is trying to find inside herself. Aronofsky has a very interesting filming style; you are in there with the dancers as they perform and that makes it even more exciting particularly at the end! In fact, you literally 'follow' the character, Nina, all the way through the film. It's a brilliant film with some great performances; well worth a second (or even first) look if you get the chance and one I highly recommend.My score: 8.7/10.IMDb Score: 8.3/10 (based on 192,436 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 87/100 (based on 261 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 86/100 (based on 116,116 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",9,1,3,28 January 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," If you've seen one before...Be prepared for more of the same
","Having seen all the previous films in the series and despite being woefully disappointed by the third instalment, I decided to give this one a go anyway. The critics tell me it's better than 'At Worlds End' and I am prepared (on this occasion) to believe them. Fortunately (for them), they were indeed correct and while not as good as the first two, it is an improvement. I will give you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.This time Jack Sparrow is on the trail of the Fountain of Youth. Teaming up with an old flame, Angelica, who turns out to be the daughter of the notorious pirate Blackbeard, Jack finds himself aboard Blackbeard's ship and on route to the island where the Fountain can be found. Also on their trail there is Barbossa who, having lost his leg to Blackbeard is out for revenge. Throw in the might of the Spanish fleet and there's more than enough competition for the prize. Certain items have to be collected before the Fountain can be used, not least of which is the tear of a mermaid and this proves very difficult to obtain. I don't want to say too much, but needless to say a perilous journey is about to culminate in the mother of all showdowns! I had better not say any more of the Spoiler Police (Pirates Division) will have me clapped in irons and keel-hauled.Very well made with some excellent CGI and stunt work; these are the hallmarks of these films. Performance wise; Johnny Depp did his usual comic turn as Jack Sparrow, Penélope Cruz did a decent job as Angelica Teach, Geoffrey Rush was good (as ever) as Barbossa and Ian McShane I felt did a decent job as Blackbeard. Honourable mentions must also go to; Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, Sam Claflin as Philip, Astrid Bergès-Frisbey as Syrina, Stephen Graham as Scrum, Keith Richards as Captain Teague and Richard Griffiths as King George.Although I did find it entertaining to a point, I did feel it got a little tedious and predictable towards the end. The trouble is, with three previous films, we have seen it all before and it does all get a little repetitive. I also felt it was way too long! I guess the films are still making large amounts of cash for the Disney machine and so they will continue to make them (sadly). I think, if you haven't seen a 'Pirates of the Caribbean' film before then I can recommend it to you; if you have, then be prepared for more of the same.My score: 6.3/10 IMDb Score: 6.6/10 (based on 111,001 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 33/100 (based on 245 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 61/100 (based on 145,528 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",6,0,0,29 January 2012
The New World," Very lone & very 'artsy'...
","This film was recommended to me and so, on good faith alone, I sat down to watch. I've heard many good things about Terrence Malick over the years and so was looking forward to a bit of a cinematic treat. Sometime things don't turn out the way you expect and this was one of those occasions. I will explain more after this brief summary.It is the early 1600's and the eastern seaboard of America is being discovered and colonised. A group of English explorers find a place on the coast of Virginia and set up a base there. They send a group lead by Captain Smith out to trade with the natives. They capture him and are about to execute him when he is saved by the Chief's daughter, Pocahontas. Thus begins the famous love story. Eventually, after helping the colonists more than once, she is forced to go and live with them. Captain Smith is called back to England by the King and Pocahontas is left alone. Believing he is dead she takes a husband, John Rolfe, but this is not the end of the story. There, I said it was going to be brief.On the positive side this film is beautifully shot with some beautiful scenery and great set pieces. Performance-wise, nobody put a foot wrong, Colin Farrell did a fine job as Captain Smith, although I felt he was totally miscast (more on that later). Q'orianka Kilcher was also great as Pocahontas, as was Christopher Plummer as Captain Newport and Christian Bale as John Rolfe. It just didn't have any energy about it. I felt so depressed by the time I got to the end of the two hours and thirty minutes.On the casting, although I have nothing against Colin Farrell, he's a fine actor who has appeared in some great films. I just felt he was totally wrong for this role, to have an Irish man (with an Irish accent) playing the part of an English man I find totally stupid and slightly offensive. But enough of that, back to the film, I it found quite boring and also very depressing. It's very 'artsy' with the characters inner thoughts being voiced, but it just didn't work for me. I will give it a half decent score for the visuals and the music wasn't too bad either, but unless you've got a spare two hours and thirty minutes of you life you don't want back Not recommended.My Score: 5.6/10",6,2,2,10 July 2011
Howl's Moving Castle," Beautifully animated... Worth a look!...
","One thing I cannot get over is the beautiful clarity of the animation. Studio Ghibli has a very particular style and I must admit to being a great fan of the way their films look; at times they can be quite breathtaking. I also love the imagination of the people that designed things like the Castle, it's quite fantastic. Putting aside the visuals for a moment, I have to say that, sadly, I did find this one a little too long at nearly two hours. Although I did find the story quite enthralling at times, there wasn't quite enough (for me) to enthral me for quite that long. Having said that it's still an excellent piece of work and one I have no problem in deeming Recommended.My score: 7.1/10.IMDb Score: 8.1/10 (based on 73,040 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 86/100 (based on 147 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 93/100 (based on 220,543 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,0,1,26 February 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," The best bromance on the big screen is back again with avengeance
","Having watched and enjoyed the previous Guy Richie Sherlock Holmes film at about the same time last year, it was nice to re-acquaint myself with the franchise on its second instalment. All the elements that made the first film great are back again, more so in some cases, and it was great to see that Richie still hasn't lost his eye for the visuals. I will give you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.Countries in Europe are being brought to the brink of war due to a series of bombings that appear to be being perpetrated by extremists. The truth is, they are all the work of one man, Professor James Moriarty. It is clear that there is only one person who has the capability to stop him; Sherlock Holmes. Of course he drags Dr. Watson into it and manages to ruin his stag night in the process. The damsel in distress this time comes in the form of a gypsy fortune teller, Madam Simza Heron, whose brother has been incorporated into Moriarty's plan. Sherlock's brother, Mycroft Holmes also gets involved and that makes for some interesting times. The question is, can Holmes and Watson foil Moriarty's plans? Well, as you can probably guess, those Spoiler Police with their fiendish disguises may well be in the room at this very moment, so I must be very careful not to say too much (again).As we've come to expect, this film looks great, Guy Richie really knows his craft and all the tricks are in evidence here. Some really superb 'bullet time' effects and some great fight scenes are fast becoming Richie's hallmark. A great soundtrack from Hans Zimmer also backs up the visuals perfectly. All the performances were great, in particular; Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law as Dr, John Watson, both did a great job reprising the bromance that was so successful in the first film. Also worthy of note were; Noomi Rapace as Madam Simza Heron, Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, Jared Harris as Professor James Moriarty, Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes, Paul Anderson as Colonel Sebastian Moran, Kelly Reilly as Mary Watson and Geraldine James as Mrs. Hudson.Lots of action, a fair smattering of comedy and a thrilling plot go together to make up this film. Most of it works pretty well, however there is a bit of a weak link and that is the part of the story involving the character played by the, woefully underused, Noomi Rapace. I thought it was a little weak and didn't quite have enough believability (for me). Having said that, the rest of the film was very thrilling and entertaining throughout with a great ending! Over all, I did enjoy this film a lot more than I thought I would at the beginning and so I'm very pleased to deem it Recommended.My score: 7.7/10.IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 19,468 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 59/100 (based on 173 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

Source Code," A nice piece of Sci-Fi... with a twist...
","Having watched, and loved, the first film directed by Duncan Jones, Moon (2009), I was very interested to see this, his second feature. Fortunately this time it was showing at my local cinema and I didn't have to make a forty mile round trip to see it. It's quite an interesting time-travel based story with a bit of a twist at the end. I'll give you my thoughts after this brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please find that bomber and save the day while I write the next paragraph).Colter Stevens is a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan who wakes up on a train sitting across from a beautiful woman, Christina Warren. He is confused and disorientated at first, but after a while he begins to calm down. Just as he thinks everything is going to be alright, BOOM the train blows up and he finds himself back in some kind of capsule. The face of Colleen Goodwin appears on a monitor and asks him if he has found the bomber. Even more confusion sweeps over Stevens as he tries to figure out just what has happened to him. Goodwin calms him down and sends him back in, explaining that it is very important that he finds the bomb and the bomber. She also explains that he will only have eight minutes each time. Going back, he realises that the woman across from him is a friend of the person he is inhabiting. He goes back quite a few times, each time to the same point in time and each time he discovers more about Christina and each time he gets closer to finding the bomber. He eventually becomes obsessed with saving Christina and the other passengers, and to this end he takes a massive risk. I will end my summary here, don't want the Spoiler Police after me.This is a very well made film with lots of attention to detail, everything fits and everything works pretty well. There are overtones of Groundhog Day (1993), in that a time period is repeated, but I found this one very different. One of the best performances from Jake Gyllenhaal as Colter Stevens since Donnie Darko (IMO). Michelle Monaghan did a good job as Christina Warren as did Vera Farmiga as Colleen Goodwin. Also an honourable mention goes to Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Routlege.Although not as good as 'Moon', IMO, I really liked this film and I would watch it again. It's nicely paced, there's a pretty good soundtrack, although it's quite subdued and at ninety three minutes, it's not too long. Over all, it's a well written, nicely paced piece of science fiction with quite a nice twist at the end. Comparisons have been made with 'Inception' but I'm not even going to go there, they are totally different Recommended.My Score: 8.3/10",8,1,2,10 April 2011
The Hangover," Not that great IMO...
","I can't exactly remember who recommended this on to me, maybe I was drugged, but I can't say I was overly impressed. I'm not a huge fan of American comedies anyway (sorry guys, I just don't get your sense of humour) so I guess that wasn't the best start. I found many things I didn't like about 'The Hangover', but it's not all bad, there were one or two good things. But more of that later, here's a short synopsis first.Doug is getting married and, as is the tradition, he and his friends, Phil, Stu and the bride's brother, Alan are off on a bachelor party in Las Vegas. The evening starts off well with impromptu drinks on the roof of Caesar's Palace, but from then on it gets kind of messed up. Phil, Stu and Alan wake up the following morning in their hotel room. There is no sign of Doug and there's a tiger in the bathroom. They also find a baby in a closet. It's now a race against time to piece together the events of the previous evening so they can find Doug and get him to the wedding. On the way we discover, amongst other things, that they stole a police car, Stu got married to a 'dancer' called Jade and a Chinese man called Mr Chow is after them for some reason. Throw in an appearance from Mike Tyson and that's your movie folks! Do they ever find Doug?... What do you think?... I guess it's not too hard to figure out.Unfortunately a lot of comedy filmmakers decide to make the characters so much larger than life that they just become gross parodies of themselves. For example, the character Phil is a teacher who is married with a son. He steals money from the kids in his class to finance his trip to Vegas. To me that's reprehensible behaviour, but to some people that's just funny. So, I found the humour in this film was pretty well wide of the mark to put it mildly.OK, so what was good about it? I thought the cameo by Heather Graham as Jade was good and I found Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow very funny. Other than that there's not much to recommend, the performances of the main cast were OK but the loathsome characters and the mindless plot just left me cold. I know there are a lot of people out there that may disagree with me on this one, but not recommended IMO.My score: 5.3/10",5,0,3,26 September 2010
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Lots of action... But ultimately disappointing...
","I quite enjoyed the first two films of this series, I found them entertaining as well as having a relatively decent plot line. The third one fell a bit short of the mark and this one, well, let's say you can tell it was made for the 3D market. It unfortunately has a 15 certificate here in the UK, which is a shame because my 13 year-old nephew would love this kind of thing. To give the film its due, it does do what it says on the tin, and it does it over and over again But more of my thoughts after this brief summary.We begin in Tokyo at the headquarters of The Umbrella Corporation. It is under attack, not from the many zombies they have inflicted on the world, but from multiple copies, clones, of Alice. Showing no mercy she dispatches all that get in her way until she comes face to face with Albert Wesker, the head of the company. He escapes in a plane, only to find the original Alice aboard. The plane crashes and Alice escapes the wreckage. Taking another plane, she heads north, hoping to find 'Arcadia', a place that has been transmitting on the radio, advertising itself as a haven. She had sent her friends there at the end of the previous film. She arrives to find nothing no town, no community, just a field and a beach. A movement catches her eye and she tracks it down, it's Claire Redfield, one of the people she had sent there. Claire is suffering from memory loss due to a device attached to her chest. Alice removes it and they fly off down the coast. Eventually they find a prison surrounded by thousands of zombies where some survivors are holed up. They include a former basketball star, Luther West, a film producer, Bennett and his intern, Kim Yong and Claire's brother, Chris. They discover that 'Arcadia' is a ship anchored off shore, but how to get there past all those zombies. And when they do, what's awaiting them? Well, as usual, I'm not going to tell you here I've probably given away too much already and those Spoiler Police will be tracking my movements by satellite as I type.This is very much an action flick, with a heavy emphasis on the action. The plot, well, that's just a device to get us to the next action sequence, right? As far as performances go, well, it's quite a physically demanding film and they all coped pretty well with that, acting-wise, well nobody was really stretched, but I will give a few honourable mentions. I love Milla Jovovich as Alice, it's a role she's made her own over the years, but I don't think it's doing her any favours now. Ali Larter did a decent job as Claire Redfield and Kim Coates played the villainous Bennett very well, I just wish he had more screen time. It was nice to see Wentworth Miller breaking out of prison again, this time as Chris Redfield and Shawn Roberts was suitably sinister as Albert Wesker.As I said at the beginning, you can tell this was made for the 3D market. There are far too many slow-motion seg-ways in the action sequences. This was done back in the day of 'The Matrix' and it's been done to death since! No reason for it here. It seems the director got all his 3D toys out and totally forgot about making a properly scripted and plotted film. It looked like a collection of set-pieces loosely linked together by a rather weak narrative. Unfortunately it's left wide open for another sequel and I hope they forget about 3D and concentrate on the story for a change. Over all, apart from the annoying slow-motion bits, the action sequences are very well done, as is, for the most part, the CGI. I just wish I could say the same for the plot and the dialogue Not recommended.My Score: 4.6/10",Null,3,6,24 July 2011
United 93," Thought provoking and quite emotional...
","If the events depicted in this film were entirely fiction then nobody would believe it was possible that such monstrous acts could be committed. I remember the events of September 11th 2001 very well and I recall being totally shocked as I watched it unfold on various TV news channels. I saw this film soon after release and it provoked quite an emotional response; ten years after those terrible events it still has the same effect on me. I'll tell you a little about the film before I give you my thoughts on it.United Airlines flight 93 is due to take off from Newark and fly to San Francisco. We are shown the crew boarding the plane and making preparations for the flight, at this stage it's almost like a 'fly-on-the-wall' documentary with idle chat about the weather and everyday things. The passengers then board with more of the same, it's just another ordinary day on an airline. Except for the four terrorists that plan to take over the plane and crash it into an unspecified target. Attention is split between these events and the goings on at the various air traffic control centres along the eastern seaboard of the United States. As two plane crash into the World Trade Centre and one into the Pentagon we see how they deal with the situation and how the military get involved. This takes up a good two thirds of the film. The final third concentrates on events aboard United 93 as the terrorists take charge and the passengers, finding out about the other events of the day, decide to fight back.As I've already said, I found this quite an emotional experience, particularly when various passengers are saying goodbye to their loved ones over the phone. It's also very thought provoking, the opening scene is of some of the terrorists praying in their hotel room before setting off in the morning. Something I found quite peculiar given the act they were about to carry out. Isn't religion supposed to be all about getting along with your fellow man? OK, I'm going off topic here.The film does appear slightly uneven, but then again, trying to fit all the events of that day into 111 minutes can't have been easy. It's very well made with, as I've already said, almost a documentary feel to it for much of the screen time. In fact, many of the Air Traffic Controllers are played by the actual guys that were doing the job that day. As the film gets to events on the plane we get a more dramatic feel to the narrative and this is the most powerful part, I feel. Either way, if you witnessed, or heard the events of '9/11', as it's known in America, and even if you didn't, I very highly recommend you watch this film.My Score: 8.8/10.IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 51,244 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 91/100 (based on 200 reviews counted at the time of going to press).FAVOURITE QUOTES:Honor Elizabeth Wainio: Hi mom, it's me... this really kind woman handed me the phone and told me to call you.(last title cards).

Casablanca," A truly excellent film that lives up to it's billing 'A Classic'!...
","This is a film I've seen many times before but this is the first time I've actually sat down and 'watched' it. I must say I was surprised at just how good it was. Before, there had always been distractions, but today I watched it right through and I must say I was very impressed. It's the kind of film my parents would watch and so it never featured very high on my radar. But when I got into watching films more seriously this was always one of those that had a lot of critical acclaim and so I added it to 'The List'. It finally lands on TV and I had a chance to see it tonight Truly excellent! I will explain what I mean by that after this very brief summary.At the beginning of World War II many people tried to get out of Europe and one of the preferred routes was via Casablanca to Lisbon and then on to America. Consequently there were many refugees stranded in Casablanca falling prey to corrupt officials and other less savoury characters. Bar owner Rick Blaine wants nothing to do with all this business, in fact he doesn't even like people talking politics in his place. But when certain travel documents fall into his possession he finds it hard to remain neutral. Particularly when an ex-lover, Ilsa Lund, appears on the scene with her husband Victor Laszlo. Throw in a corrupt, but charismatic, French Police official, Captain Louis Renault, a German, Major Heinrich Strasser who is bent on arresting Victor Laszlo and, of course, Rick's piano player, Sam, and you've got the makings of a really great film. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (Classics Division) will have me in a concentration camp (again).You would have thought a film made in black and white and shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio would be really hard to watch. I'm here to tell you it's one of the easiest films to watch I've seen it quite a while. All the action is concentrated in the middle of the screen; every shot is set up that way. I guess it helps that it is based on a stage play in that respect. Performance wise, well I cannot fault anyone, but I must give special praise to both Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, both were truly excellent! Honourable mentions must also go to; Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault, Conrad Veidt as Major Heinrich Strasser, Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari and Peter Lorre as Ugarte.I'm not usually all the big on love stories but in this case I will make an exception. I think it's the quality of the performances that really makes this work as well as it does. There is a lot of political intrigue in there too. If you remember that at the time it was being made America had not joined the war in Europe and so what it says politically is pretty important too. But getting away from the politics of the thing, I found this film totally engaging all the way through with characters you could believe in and a great script. I said it at the beginning and I'll say it again Truly excellent and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.7/10.IMDb Score: 8.7/10 (based on 204,219 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 97/100 (based on 59 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

In Bruges," Good fun... But with a dark side...
","This is, again, a film I have seen before and, again, I took more out of it on a second viewing. This one seems to cover all the bases; drama, romance, comedy, thrills; it's got the lot to varying degrees. The first time I saw it, it was the comedy that stood out; this time I was more struck by the drama of it. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please take a tour of Bruges while I write the next paragraph).Two hit men, Ray and Ken have been sent to lie low in Bruges (Belgium, for those that don't know where it is) by their boss, Harry, after a bungled hit. They check into their hotel only to find, to their dismay, that they will be sharing a room. This does not go down well, but it's near Christmas and everywhere is fully booked. The two men are complete opposites, Ken is quite cultured and is happy to go sightseeing in the medieval city. Ray, on the other hand, is much younger and would be happier spending his time in a bar. Ken insists they do some culture and Ray acts like a bored teenager. That is until he discovers a film crew who have a dwarf in the cast, he is fascinated with Jimmy. There he also meets the mysterious Chloe, who he invites out on a date. That evening Harry calls and tells Ken the real purpose for their visit. I will leave my summary here so as not to enrage the spoiler police too much.I think the Bruges tourist board will be very happy with this film; the medieval architecture comes across beautifully. The cinematography is great and the setting adds real atmosphere. Great performances all round, particularly from; Colin Farrell as Ray, Brendan Gleeson as Ken and Ralph Fiennes as Harry, all were excellent. Honourable mentions also go to; Clémence Poésy as Chloe and Jordan Prentice as Jimmy, both were very good.As I said at the beginning, there is a lot of comedy in this film, it's mainly in the things Ray says and does. Few films make me laugh out loud, but this one did in more than a couple of places. The drama comes mainly in the final third and I found it didn't quite have the impact it might have done. I guess the comedy reduced the force of the dramatic conclusion, although by then the comedy is very, very dark. The ending, I felt, was a little bit of a let-down, I expected something much bigger. But over all, a very enjoyable film with some laughs, excellent cinematography and some great performances Recommended.My score: 8.1/10",8,1,3,20 March 2011
Chinatown," A classic detective thriller...
","Having recently watched Mr Polanski's The Ghost Writer (2010), I decided to look back at one of his earlier works. I saw Chinatown many years ago and so it was an interesting experience to re-visit the old classic. Set in, what appears to be, 1930's Los Angeles during a heat wave, private detective J.J. Gittes makes a living investigating adultery cases.One day, a Mrs Evelyn Mulwray walks into Mr Gittes office and hires him to investigate he husband Hollis. She believes he is having an affair and wants evidence. Gittes and his associates get right on the case. Mr Mulwray is followed as he goes about his work as Chief Engineer of the city's water department. There is a meeting about building a new dam to bring more water to the city that Mulwray is against. He also spends time inspecting dry river beds and finishes up spending most of the night on a beach where a large amount of water is dumped very late in the evening. Eventually he is caught out with a young blonde woman and the evidence, in the form of photographs, is obtained. The following day the story is all over the newspapers and Mr Gittes is confronted by the real Mrs Mulwray and her lawyer. Everybody wants to talk to Mr Mulwray but he seems to have disappeared. He is later found dead in a reservoir with salt water in his lungs. Mr Gittes now has another mystery to solve, one involving corruption the city's water department, Evelyn Mulwray and her rich father, Noah Cross.This is a classic movie, no special effects or fancy techniques, just the skill of the director and the art of the actors to convey the story. It's the little things I noticed that made this film a stand out for me, the setting of pocket watches to find out what time Mr Mulwray left the beach or the smashing of a tail-light to make a car easier to follow at night. Great performances from all of the main cast, special mentions go to the immense Jack Nicholson as J.J.Gittes, the fabulous Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray and the great John Huston as Noah Cross.It's a very slow paced film that, for me, got a little bit too pedestrian towards the middle. The storytelling was spot on and the cinematography and dialogue were great. Over all it's a really compelling detective story with quite a few twists and turns in it. There's quite a different ending that you may not expect. It may have scored higher if it hadn't fallen a bit flat in the middle, but it's most definitely recommended.My score: 8.3/10",8,1,2,3 May 2010
Mulan," Much better than I Expected... Especially 'Donkey'...
","I don't watch many Disney films these days, I've probably outgrown many of them, but I took an exception in this case. It had been recommended to me and so I thought I'd give it a look when it came up on TV recently. I was pleasantly surprised, a strong story, some nice animation and a few decent songs thrown in not too shabby. I'll give you my more detailed thoughts after this brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please go training with the army while I write the next paragraph).Mulan is a spirited girl who, having failed to make an impression with the matchmaker, is looking for some other way of bringing honour to her family. China has been invaded by the Huns, lead by the very tough and evil, Shan Yu. An army is being raised by the Emperor and Mulan's father, Fa Zhou, is chosen as one of the conscripts from their village, but he was injured fighting for the Emperor before. He insists he will go, but Mulan has other ideas. Stealing his armour and his sword and taking her horse, Khan, she sets off to join the army in his place, hoping she can pass herself off as a man. The penalty, if she's discovered, is death. To help her on this quest, the family ancestors, inadvertently, send Mushu, a small dragon with ambitions to improve his position. A lucky cricket, Cri-Kee, also comes along on the adventure. The soldiers are led by Captain Li Shang, the son of a General and a very handsome man. Calling herself Ping, Mulan is befriended by three soldiers, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po, but can she pull off this charade and will she bring honour to her family? Well, you probably guessed it, I'm not going to tell you here, those Spoiler Police will be after me if I do.I found this film surprisingly good, some great animation, a really good story and some pretty good songs along the way. The only let-down (for me) was the inclusion of the voice of Eddie Murphy as Mushu. Whenever I hear him now I think of 'Donkey' from the Shrek films. Don't get me wrong, he has some great lines and does his stuff very well, but I just kept seeing 'Donkey' in my mind's eye. The film started very strongly with a nice set-up and it was looking good until the 'comic relief' is brought in ('Donkey'). It's then a struggle for the narrative, which is very good by the way, to fight its way past the comic japes of 'Donkey'. Fortunately, it does and we end up with a pretty good film that's entertaining, funny (thanks 'Donkey') and, at times, quite dramatic.Decent performances all round, Ming-Na did a good job as the voice of Mulan, ably backed up by Lea Salonga who did the singing parts for the character. B.D. Wong did a nice job as Li Shang with Donny Osmond doing the singing parts. The voice that really stood out (for me apart from 'Donkey') though was Miguel Ferrer as the voice of the evil Shan-Yu, he was really menacing and made you believe in the character. Honourable mentions go to the voices of; Harvey Fierstein as Yao, Gedde Watanabe as Ling and Jerry Tondo as Chien-Po. I would also like to mention George Takei who had a nice little cameo as the voice of the First Ancestor.Over all a pretty enjoyable film with lots to admire. The animation of the scene where the Huns are attacking down a snow-covered hill is quite spectacular. Would I watch it again? Yes, I didn't find 'Donkey' all that bad at the end of the day, and, who knows? I may even see him as a small Chinese dragon one day Recommended.My Score 7.3/10",7,0,0,16 April 2011
The Big Lebowski," Almost perfect from the Coen Brothers...
","I'll admit I am a big fan of this film; I've loved it since I first saw it on a grainy rental video back in 2000. To me the Coen brothers have made two outstanding films, this one and Fargo (1996), and yes, I know there will be some disagreement out there about that, but it's only my opinion. Now, before I tell you why I think this is such a great film, here's a little bit about the plot.Jeffrey Lebowski (a.k.a. The Dude), is disturbed one evening when two heavies break into his house and demand money that his wife owes their boss. One of them urinates on his rug before they realise they have the wrong Lebowski This one isn't even married. The next day The Dude complains about this to his bowling buddies, Walter Sobchak and Donny Kerabatsos. They figure out it's a case of mistaken identity and The Dude goes to see the man they really wanted, another Jeffrey Lebowski - The Big Lebowski, who happens to be a millionaire. Leaving with a replacement rug, The Dude meets the young trophy wife, Bunny Lebowski. A few days later he is contacted by Mr Lebowski's assistant, Brandt, because Bunny has been kidnapped and they want The Dude to act as the bag man. I won't say any more, but that's basically the set-up. Throw in The Big Lebowski's artist daughter Maude (from a previous marriage) and some crazy German nihilists and you can see there's plenty to keep the audience amused and entertained.This is an exceptionally well made film with a great cast, a great score and some really different and enthralling dream sequences thrown in. To me it's almost the perfect movie, I say almost, because I like to leave a little margin for improvement. Great performances all round from; Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Lebowski - The Dude, John Goodman as Walter Sobchak, Julianne Moore as Maude Lebowski, Steve Buscemi as Donny Kerabatsos, David Huddleston as Jeffrey Lebowski - The Big Lebowski, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Brandt and Tara Reid as Bunny Lebowski. Oh, and I almost forgot a stellar performance by John Turturro as Jesus Quintana.As I've already said, this is, to me, almost the perfect movie. I say that because I can only find one scene that doesn't add anything substantial to the story. It's the one where The Dude confronts the guy in the VW Beetle (for those that have seen it). Apart from that, an almost perfect movie. Very highly recommended.My score: 9.3/10",9,1,3,29 August 2010
Akira," One of the best Anime I've seen... (so far)...
","I must admit I have not seen a great deal of Anime but having seen this I am keen to see more. The version I saw was dubbed into English, which made it a little easier to concentrate on the visuals which were quite stunning. The plot I found to be very inventive and quite enthralling, if a little complicated. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.After World War III, Tokyo is destroyed. It is re-built and re-named Neo-Tokyo. Parts of the old city still exist but are not inhabited. A biker gang lead by Shôtarô Kaneda, known as Kaneda for short, travels the streets, picking fights with rival gangs and generally doing what kids do. There are riots in the streets and anti-government protesters have broken into a secret facility and kidnapped a small boy. This boy has special powers and is separated from his kidnapper before he is involved in an accident with one of the bikers, Tetsuo Shima. The government people holding the boy come to pick him up and also take Tetsuo with them. His accident has released a power within him, one that he will struggle to control in the future. He becomes aware of another who had similar powers, Akira, and he makes it his mission to locate Akira. Many will try to stop him, including the boy and his two companions and Kaneda. Will they be able to stop Tetsuo from releasing Akira and possibly bringing about another catastrophe on Tokyo? Well, you probably guessed I'm not going to tell you here, those Spoiler Police are tough.As I've already said, the animation is first rate, I assume that there was very little, if any, work done on a computer, given when it was made, which makes it even more remarkable. I did find it a little too long and a little too drawn out towards the end, but it didn't detract too much from, what is, a very fine piece of work.The thing that struck me was, as with the majority of Anime I've seen, all the action takes place from the point of view of the young people. Personally, and probably because I'm older, I would prefer to see a more balanced point of view. It's only a slight niggle, I know, but maybe something the filmmakers might like to consider. Over all though, a rather excellent piece of work! Recommended.My Score: 8.6/10",9,4,8,2 July 2011
Memento," Very compelling.... and backwards!
","Having recently seen and really loved Inception, I decided to see what other Christopher Nolan films lurked in my DVD collection. I couldn't believe it when I found I had never seen Memento. Well, a day work off due to an injury gave me the time to rectify this situation.Leonard suffers from short-term memory loss. He can remember meeting you, but only for a few minutes, and then it fades away. He got this condition when he was hit in the head whilst trying to save his wife from the man who raped and murdered her. So, he can remember everything up to that point, but no further. In order to help him he takes photographs of people he meets and places he goes. He annotates these so he can refer back to them. There are also tattoos on his body of things he has decided are too important to lose. He is determined to find the man that murdered his wife and kill him. To this end he is helped by a character called Teddy, who seems to be a bit of a low-life. Along the way he also runs into Natalie, who has also lost someone and is more than she might first seem. Before the murder Leonard was an insurance investigator and he uses his skills to try and track down the mysterious John G, a name he has tattooed on his chest.The story is told backwards; we start with Leonard killing the man he thinks is responsible for everything, and work back from there. It's a very interesting and effective way to tell this story, but you can't really take a bathroom break because you'll lose where the story is. I found the DVD pause facility very useful! Great performances from Guy Pearce as Leonard, also, Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie and Joe Pantoliano as Teddy Gammell. Honourable mentions go to Jorja Fox as Leonard's wife, Stephen Tobolowsky as Sammy Jankis and Harriet Sansom Harris as Mrs. Jankis.Although there are some nice action sequences in the film I found it to be quite slowly paced. It gradually draws the audience into Leonard's world as we find out more about how events transpired. The score is quite subdued and fits the mood of the piece perfectly. Over all, a very interesting and absorbing film, I liked it a lot! Recommended.My score: 9.1/10",9,0,2,26 July 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Engrossing from start to finish...
","I'll admit I'm not the greatest fan of Mr Tarantino's work, for me he can blow hot and cold. He sometimes seems to be more interested in putting in subtle little twists and nods to obscure films that will only be admired by a certain few, rather than making a coherent movie. In this film, however, the twists and nods either too subtle for me, which I suspect, or he's actually attempted to make a movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect and it's very, very long, but it does all tie together quite neatly in the end.When Shosanna Dreyfus escapes from the Nazis having seen her family shot, she thought she'd never see the man responsible for it, Col. Hans Landa, again. However, fate has a nasty way of playing evil tricks on people like Shosanna. Four years later she owns and runs a cinema in Paris, where, thanks to the attentions of a young German war hero, Pvt. Fredrick Zoller, she is to stage a German film premiere. All the German High Command, including Hitler himself, is to attend. News of this event comes through to Lt. Aldo Raine and his band of Inglorious Basterds, who are behind enemy lines causing havoc and fear in the German ranks. They are to destroy the cinema with the help of a spy, Bridget von Hammersmark, but the newly appointed head of security, Col. Hans Landa has other plans. I think that's a pretty good summary, without giving too much away (I hope).Let me first say that as a whole, I really enjoyed watching this film. It's not Tarantino's best, that's still a tie between Pulp Fiction (1994) and Jackie Brown (1997) in my book. The performances are all outshone by Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa; he quite deservedly won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar and BAFTA awards (plus quite a few others I see). Honourable mentions go to Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine (loved the accent), Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus, Eli Roth as Sgt. Donny Donowitz, Michael Fassbender as Lt. Archie Hicox, Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark and Daniel Brühl as Pvt. Fredrick Zoller.Although I'm quite used to watching foreign language films, I found the switching between scenes in English, to scenes in German or French with subtitles quite distracting. Don't get me wrong, many of the scenes were very well done and quite absorbing to watch, but they didn't always fit together as well as they might. The music was pretty good too, although I did feel I was watching a Spaghetti Western at a couple of points near the beginning. So, over all it's quite an engrossing film, if a little difficult to watch in one sitting at nearly two and a half hours in duration. But having said that, I do recommend it, it's worth seeing if only for the performance of Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt's Tennessee accent.My score: 8.4/10",8,1,5,29 March 2010
Iron Man 2," A fair sequel...
","I very much enjoyed the first film in this series and was hoping for more of the same in the sequel. Fortunately I wasn't too disappointed, it lived up to the first one, maybe not quite as good (sequels seldom are), but a fine effort nonetheless. The setting is New York where Tony Stark, having revealed himself as Iron Man and having brought peace to the world, is holding his Stark Expo, an exhibition of technology from all over the world. An idea originated by his father, Howard.In Russia, Ivan Vanko, brooding after the death of his father, Anton, who had worked with Howard Stark on the early prototype of the power source that now drives Iron Man's suit. He was extradited back to Russia for espionage and made to live in Siberia. Ivan, now seeking revenge works on a suit of his own. Meanwhile back in the USA, Tony Stark has been summoned before a Senate committee who are determined to get him to give them the Iron Man suit for military use. One of the experts called to the hearing is Justin Hammer, one of Stark's former competitors when he made weapons for a living. Bringing his friend, Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes to testify backfires on the committee and Stark wins the day, but things are not over between him and Hammer.Stark now decides to hand control of Stark Industries over to Pepper Potts having discovered his health is at risk from wearing the suit. The papers are drawn up and a woman from the legal department, Natalie Rushman, brings them for signing. She impresses Stark and later becomes Pepper's assistant. Heading to Monaco, Stark decides to compete in a motor race. He is surprised when Ivan Vanko turns up and destroys his car with plasma whips. Fortunately, Pepper is there with his Iron Man suit and he manages to subdue the Russian. Vanko goes to jail but is later sprung by someone who is very interested in his work.Returning home, Stark prepares for his birthday party, but with many things praying on his mind he gets drunk wearing the suit and ends up in a fight with Rhodey. Enter Nick Fury who helps put Stark back on the road to recovery and reveal that someone close to him is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Hammer is due to show the work he has been doing at Stark's Expo and he has a few things he wants to surprise him with. Things are brewing up for a big fight at the end, but I don't want to spoil it for you, I'll just say it's pretty spectacular and Vanko isn't finished with Stark just yet.This is a very well made film with plenty of very well designed and executed special effects. The score is great, but if you put AC/DC, The Clash and Queen in there you're always going to get my vote! The performances were all good, special mentions go to Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer and Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko. Honourable mentions go to Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.I must admit I didn't much care for the character of Tony Stark at first, he is egotistic and narcissistic. As the film went on he did show he does have a human side though. Justin Hammer is equally egotistic which I found made for an interesting dynamic to this good versus evil story. I also had a problem with America being the centre of everything, yet again, it's like the rest of the world doesn't exist! (Apart from Monaco). Although I did find it amusing when Stark is standing in front of a giant US flag projected on a screen with an Australian/British rock band providing the music. But enough of these minor niggles, the film is great fun, not as good as the first one, but as sequels go, it's certainly watchable. Over all, recommended.My score: 7.2/10",7,4,15,1 May 2010
Shaun of the Dead," Simon Pegg's Zombie Comedy with Blood Guts & Gore.
","Having been derided by my mates down the pub for not having seen this one, I decided it was time to bite the bullet. Now, I have seen some of Simon Pegg's more recent works, Hot Fuzz (2007) was pretty good, as was Run Fatboy Run (also 2007) and How to Lose Friends & Alienate People (2008). He's now making the big bucks in America, but I was quite interested to see how one of his earlier works turned out.Shaun lives with two flatmates, Ed and Pete, in London. Ed is always taking Shaun down the local pub, The Winchester, to the disgust of Shaun's girlfriend, Liz. She, and her friends, Dianne and David, want Shaun to break away from Ed and straighten himself out. Unfortunately, Shaun is very attached to Ed; they've known each other since they went to school together. This comes to a head when Liz dumps Shaun and he ends up going out and getting drunk with Ed. As we see them going about their lives we get an inkling that something is not right, people are starting to behave strangely. The morning after, it becomes apparent that something is seriously wrong. News reports confirm that Zombies are loose on the streets and it's not safe out there! Shaun decides to go and rescue his mum, Barbara, and his step-dad, Philip. Then go and get Liz and then go to the pub. So, they have a plan, but there's a lot of Zombies out there! There are a lot of pretty funny bits in this film, I particularly liked the LP scene and the 'Queen' fight scene in the bar. If you've seen the film you'll know the ones I mean. Decent performances from all of the main cast, Simon Pegg as Shaun, Kate Ashfield as Liz, Nick Frost as Ed, Lucy Davis as Dianne and Dylan Moran as David. Honourable mentions also go to Peter Serafinowicz as Pete, Bill Nighy as Philip and Penelope Wilton as Barbara.So now we come to the nitty gritty, did I enjoy it? Well, it had parts that made me laugh, but as a whole it didn't really bite me on the neck. I found the character of Ed really annoying, he's stupid and very selfish. Yes, he does have a couple of good one-liners, but that doesn't make up for him being an idiot. So over all, it's a pretty dumb comedy, something to watch when you've come back from the pub. I don't think I'll be going out of my way to watch it again, but if I'm late back from the pub one night & it's on TV who knows? My score: 6.5/10",7,0,4,21 March 2010
Public Enemies," Gangster films were never like this when I was young!
","I haven't seen a gangster movie set in the 1930's for quite some time and so I was interested to see Michael Mann's take on the genre. It wasn't quite what I expected; it's very long and goes into a lot of detail about the life and times of the main protagonist, John Dillinger. But here's a little about the plot before I continue.We begin in 1933 with John Dillinger busting his gang out of prison. An audacious act that gets J.Edgar Hoover, the head of the F.B.I., to assign a task force, lead by Melvin Purvis, to track him down. Several bank raids later, Dillinger meets and falls in love with Billie Frechette, a half French, half Native American girl. They are soon parted as Purvis and his team close in on the gang. There is a lot more, and a few other noted gangsters of the period do turn up in the narrative, but those are the main points of the film.As we'd expect with a Michael Mann film, this one is technically very well done. Lots of shoot-outs, bank heists and car chases all very professionally performed. As far as performances go, I thought Johnny Depp as Okay as John Dillinger and Christian Bale did a good job as Melvin Purvis. I thought Marion Cotillard as woefully underused as Billie Frechette, although we did see what she can do briefly towards the end of the film.Over all I found it far too long with scenes that started to drag towards the end. It's an interesting story that could have been done so much better. I didn't really engage with any of the characters, I found them all a bit two dimensional apart from maybe Billie Frechette. So I'm afraid it's not really recommended, but if you've got a spare 140 minutes to kill, maybe it's for you.My score: 5.4/10",5,0,2,6 June 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," A great adventure...
","As a player of the original video game, back when computers were clunky and slow, I was quite interested to see how the Prince has evolved. I wasn't disappointed; a lot of the moves and mythology from the original game survives in this film. Obviously the graphics are much better, and the film isn't too bad either.Dastan is an orphaned street urchin when he is taken in and adopted by King Sharaman, who has seen something he likes in the boy. He grows up alongside the kings' two natural sons, Tus and Garsiv who treat him as an equal even though he will never inherit the throne. The king's brother, Nizam is with the three brothers when they approach a city that the king has told them not to take. Nizam tells the brothers that a spy has found evidence that the city is making weapons for the Persia's enemies. They take the city and Dastan comes into possession of a mysterious dagger that everyone seems interested in. Princess Tamina, who rules the city, also wants the dagger, but to protect it. The king comes to the city and is murdered, seemingly by Dastan. Fleeing for his life, he takes Tamina with him. That night, he discovers the dagger's secret, it can turn back time, but only the person holding the dagger is aware of it. This makes the dagger a very powerful weapon. It will only work for one minute though before the sand is all used up. The magical sand is hidden below the city and if it is released, it will destroy the world. Can Dastan discover who really murdered the king, and can he and Tamina keep it safe from those who would use it for evil? Well, since I don't want to spoil the ending, I'm not going to tell you right now.As with previous Disney/Jerry Bruckheimer productions, I'm thinking of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films, there plenty of swashbuckling action. It's a very well made film, as you'd expect with some very good special effects. Decent performances from all of the main cast, Jake Gyllenhaal as Dastan, Gemma Arterton as Tamina, Ben Kingsley as Nizam, Alfred Molina as Sheik Amar, Steve Toussaint as Seso, Toby Kebbell as Garsiv, Richard Coyle as Tus and Ronald Pickup as King Sharaman.A special mention for Alfred Molina as Sheik Amar, his comic role reminded slightly me of Robert Newton as Long John Silver. There was plenty of action, although I felt the ploy of running and jumping over rooftops was a little over used. Over all a very entertaining film with some great action and a pretty reasonable story, a great one to take the kids to! Recommended.My score: 7.0/10",7,9,18,22 May 2010
Oldboy," Excellent thriller with a twist...
","This is a South Korean film, yes, one of those with subtitles I'm afraid. I had heard very little about it before viewing, apart from a small synopsis, which didn't even mention it was in Korean! The setting in modern South Korea where a man has been arrested for being drunk.We begin in the police station where a very drunk man, Oh Dae-su is behaving quite badly. So bad, in fact that the police end up chaining him to the wall. Eventually his brother arrives to bail him out and we next see them in the rain at a phone box. Oh Dae-su is on the phone to his daughter, whose birthday it is, and he is telling her about the present he has bought for her. He passes the phone to his brother who talks for a moment and then turns to find Dae-su gone. We next see him in a room with a heavy, prison style metal door with a slot to pass food through at the bottom. He hears music and then gas is pumped into the room and he passes out. When he awakes, the room has been tidied and his hair has been cut. This continues for fifteen years, during which time he writes a journal where he lists all those he could have wronged in the past. When he is eventually released he makes his way to a sushi restaurant where he meets Mi-do, a girl with whom he falls in love despite the large difference in their ages. Dae-su now sets about finding out who locked him up for so long and, more importantly, why? And that is where I'll leave my short synopsis; don't want to give too much away.This is a really well made film with a great score by Seung-hyun Choi and Ji-soo Lee. There is some great imagery used throughout and, although used sparingly, the special effects were excellent also. A really great performance by Min-sik Choi as Dae-su Oh and honourable mentions also go to Ji-tae Yu as Woo-jin Lee and Hye-jeong Kang as Mi-do.Although I found this film a little long, I found it quite enjoyable to watch. As I've already said, the imagery used is very clever in places and the plot moves along at a nice pace. The story always keeps the audience guessing although I thought the pay-off at the end didn't have quite the dramatic impact it could have. Having said that, it's still well worth watching. Recommended.My score: 7.7/10",8,1,3,7 August 2010
The Secret in Their Eyes," A great film...
","First off I had better warn you that this film is in Spanish, with subtitles, so if you are put off by either of these, read no further. For those that are left, in 2010 it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, so I hoped it would have some potential I was right! It is set in Argentina in 1999 but mostly told in flashback to 1974. A story involving the investigation into a rape and murder and also an unreciprocated love story make up the plot of this very interesting drama. I enjoyed it very much and even when I thought it was dragging a bit towards the end there were still more revelations to come. Here's a very brief summary.Benjamín Esposito is a retired legal counsellor, with time on his hands he has decided to write a novel based on one of his former cases. The case, from 1974, involves the rape and murder of schoolteacher, Liliana Coloto. She had recently married Ricardo Morales, a bank clerk. In flashback we are told about the initial investigation which was not successful in bringing about a prosecution. Back in the present, we meet Esposito's former boss, now district attorney, Irene Menéndez Hastings. The pair has some history which Esposito wants to include in his novel. Back to flashback and Esposito and his colleague, Pablo Sandoval, discover another suspect who they don't seem able to locate. That is until Sandoval, who is a bit of a drunk, has a revelation and figures out a way to find him. This they do, but will justice be served? There is a lot more, but I won't tell you that here for fear of the spoiler police getting hold of me.This film has a very deliberate pace about it, nothing is rushed but still it keeps the audience interested. There is some really great dialogue which I found added a great deal of substance to the piece. Great performances all round; Ricardo Darín did a tremendous job as Benjamín Esposito, he has that look of a man weary of his work about him that I liked very much. Soledad Villamil was great as his former boss Irene Menéndez Hastings and Pablo Rago was equally good as the grieving Ricardo Morales. Finally, a special mention for Guillermo Francella who put in a great turn as the unassuming drunk, Pablo Sandoval.I really enjoyed this film, I found the flipping between the flashbacks and 1999 was very well done and didn't disturb the flow of the story too much. As I've already said, some of the dialogue is truly excellent (take note any budding screenwriters out there). It is all very well made, but I found the plot and the quality of the writing stand up very well. I should finally mention a beautiful haunting score by Federico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer, a wonderful piece of work. So, if you're not put off by subtitles I can highly recommend this Argentinean/Spanish co-production.My Score: 8.7/10",9,2,3,4 June 2011
127 Hours," Inspiring stuff from Danny Boyle...
","I know it's April already and this film came out in the UK in January, but after a very long wait it has finally landed at my local cinema! Since I've waited such a long time to see it there was no way I was going to miss it! I even dragged a friend along who doesn't often see this sort of thing. I'll give you my thoughts after this very brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please try to shift that rock while I write the next paragraph).Aron Ralston is an adventurer, mountain climber, he's most at home with all outdoor types of activities. He feels he doesn't have to rely on anyone else and has cut himself off from his friends and family to concentrate on the things he likes to do. Little does he know this is going to cost him dear. He goes out canyoneering alone near Moab, Utah but doesn't take his mobile phone (or cell phone if you prefer) with him and doesn't tell anyone where he's going. There he meets two girls, Kristi and Megan and they have a bit of fun jumping into a pool below a crack in the rocks. Eventually they go their separate ways and Aron heads off alone again. Taking a route seldom used he causes a rock fall that leaves him trapped, pinned by the arm with a large boulder. He is there for 127 hours before he uses desperate measures to free himself. During this time he reflects on the mistakes he's made in his life, making a video diary he thinks will be his legacy. I'll leave it there so as not to upset the squeamish Spoiler Police.I thought this was a very well made film with several devices used to keep the audience interested. Split screens, flashbacks, dream sequences all keep the thing moving along nicely. I have to say it's an outstanding performance from James Franco as Aron Ralston, he really nailed it! Honourable mentions also go to Kate Mara as Kristi and Amber Tamblyn as Megan.I love the visual style used by Danny Boyle in this one. It could have been a tough gritty drama like the 2003 Kevin Macdonald film Touching the Void, (also a very fine film by the way) but I found it was a lot more than that. It will make you cringe, it will make you laugh, and it will even make some of you cry, but I found it very engaging and very enthralling (even though I knew what the final outcome was) Definitely recommended.PS My friend thought it was good but a bit padded out with all that hallucinating & stuff (His words, not mine).My Score: 8.6/10",9,0,3,3 April 2011
Pirate Radio," Great soundtrack, but it didn't work (for me)
","From right back in the early days of Blackadder on TV I have been a fan of the work of Richard Curtis. Unfortunately, of late, he seems to have lost the plot somewhat and this, sadly, is an example. Don't get me wrong, it has its moments, but, with a very few exceptions, I really didn't much care for any of the characters, and when that happens, you're not on a winner I'm afraid.The setting is a ship in the North Sea off the East coast of England in 1966. We are told that the national broadcaster, the BBC, only plays popular, or rock 'n' roll, music for only 45 minutes a day. This means that pirate radio stations, like the fictitious 'Radio Rock' plays all the rock and pop they want twenty four seven. And, because they are broadcasting from offshore, they are not breaking any laws. The government are not happy about this and one minister in particular, Sir Alistair Dormandy is charged with shutting them down. Our story beings with the arrival Carl, of the godson of Quentin, the station's owner, on the boat. He's introduced to all of the DJ's, The Count, News John, Thick Kevin, Angus Nutsford, Doctor Dave, Simple Simon, Midnight Mark, Harold (the engineer) and Felicity (the cook). And later he meets Bob Silver. After the government makes it illegal to sell advertising to these stations, Quentin announces the return of an iconic DJ from the past, Gavin Canavagh, much to the dismay of The Count, who is currently rated the best DJ. I won't say too much more about the plot, don't want to give too much away to those that want to see it.It's quite a well made film, but there are several plot holes and inconsistencies that kind of spoilt it for me. There was a whole section of the film that just didn't work for me and that's the middle, where everyone's jumping into bed with everyone else. If I wanted to see that kind of stuff I'd have got a Benny Hill DVD. The best performances came from Philip Seymour Hoffman as The Count, Bill Nighy as Quentin and Kenneth Branagh as Sir Alistair Dormandy. Nobody else really stretched themselves, but honourable mentions go to Tom Sturridge as Carl, Will Adamsdale as News John, Tom Brooke as Thick Kevin, Rhys Darby as Angus Nutsford, Nick Frost as Doctor Dave (hated this character), Katherine Parkinson as Felicity, Chris O'Dowd as Simple Simon, Tom Wisdom as midnight Mark and Rhys Ifans as Gavin Canavagh.There is a great soundtrack, although given the period its set I am gob smacked that the Beatles do not have one track! Decent performances from the three I mentioned, but the script left a lot to be desired and I'm sure Mr Curtis can do so much better. So this does not come highly recommended from me, the soundtrack's pretty good and there's not a lot else to say about it really.My score: 5.2/10",5,3,6,11 April 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Great effects but a confusing plot...
","I have quite enjoyed all of the X-Men films, I can't say I was a fan of the comic books, but I do remember the animated TV shows. So I was intrigued to see the back story of one of the most memorable characters from the films. I can't say I was overly impressed, but I think that is due to the limitations the filmmakers were working under. But more of that later, here's a short synopsis first.We begin with Logan as a young boy discovering that he has a mutation, at this time his claws are bone. He and his brother, Victor, escape after Logan murders his father and they fight side by side all through the American Civil War, World War I, World War II and Vietnam. Yes, they are both indestructible. We come to the present day and the pair is recruited to a special team run by Col. William Stryker, a shady character to say the least. After one particular mission where Victor goes too far, Logan turns his back on the team and goes to live in Canada. He lives a simple live with the love of his life, Kayla. Six years later Victor re-appears and starts murdering the remaining members of the team. He eventually comes after Logan and ends up killing Kayla. Swearing vengeance, Logan is approached by Stryker who says he can give him the tools to beat Victor. Logan agrees and his body is infused with the rare metal alloy called adamantium. Now with his metal claws Logan is turned on by Stryker and is on the run. He eventually discovers exactly what Stryker has been doing and it's not good news for mutants. I'll leave it there, don't want to give the ending away.This film was OK, the effects and stunts were very well done but it did suffer from two problems. First of all I felt they tried to fit too much into the plot which meant that many things were only half explained, or the audience was left to fill in some gaping plot holes. The second problem was the fact that it only had a 12A certificate here in the UK. This meant the level of violence was very limited and this was to the determent of the film in my opinion. There's lots of talk on the DVD about Wolverine being more 'Bad-Ass' in this film, but you just didn't see it on the screen. If it had been a 15 certificate I'm sure it would have been a very different movie.Having said that, the performances all round were pretty good, so honourable mentions go to Hugh Jackman as Logan / Wolverine, Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed, Danny Huston as Col. William Stryker and Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox.Over all, it's a pretty entertaining film despite the rather confusing plot. Some great action sequences and all the CGI bells and whistles we've come to expect from these films. If you're a fan of the X-Men films then it's recommended, otherwise, maybe not.My score: 5.6/10",6,2,4,19 September 2010
Orphan," A little too long, but very creepy!...
","I didn't know much about this film before seeing it, but the write-up did intrigue me slightly so I thought I'd give it a go. It's a little too long for my liking, but quite well made if a little cliché in places. I guess I should have done a little more research, but then again I have uncovered the odd 'gem' this way in the past. But I digress; let's have a look at what Orphan is all about.Kate and John Coleman have just lost their baby, a daughter they were going to call Jessica. She was dead at birth. Needing something to fill the void, they decide to adopt. By the way, they already have two children, a boy, Daniel, and a girl, Max, who is partially deaf and uses sign language to communicate. The family are comfortably off and live in a big house in the countryside. Visiting an orphanage, John meets a nine year old girl called Esther. She is originally from Russia and is delightful. He convinces Kate that she's the one and they bring her home a few weeks later. Unfortunately Esther is not what she seems and the Coleman's are in for a very bumpy ride as she sets about her plan for them. I'm not going to say any more on the plot, I believe that should be enough to intrigue you.Although it was very well made I did have a bit of a problem sympathising with the Coleman's. It seems they have everything going for them in terms of lifestyle, job, financial security etc., but somehow that isn't enough for them. It's not as if their characters come over as particularly nurturing either, Kate a recovering alcoholic and John has been known to have a roving eye in the past. But if you can get past all that there's a pretty creepy story behind it all.Decent performances all round, particularly from; Vera Farmiga as Kate, Peter Sarsgaard as John and especially from Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther, she was particularly creepy. Also worth a mention were; CCH Pounder as Sister Abigail, Jimmy Bennett as Daniel and Aryana Engineer as Max.Putting aside my incomprehension of the reasons for the Coleman's wanting to adopt, I did find the film quite disturbing. Esther particularly so, the way she manipulates situations and how she's always listening in is quite unnerving. As I said at the beginning, it is a little cliché in places and it is way too long but over all quite a sinister tale (glad I watched it in daylight!). Finally a mention for the guys who do the opening and closing credits, very cleverly done IMO, nice work. I guess over all it's recommended, but only just.My Score: 6.1/10",6,10,12,30 May 2011
My Neighbor Totoro," A magical story given the Studio Ghibli treatment to great effect Excellent!
","Another one in my mini Studio Ghibli series. I remember the first time I saw this how blown away I was by the way everything looked so natural. The way people move, the animals and the plants all drawn with such care and attention to detail. Add to that a magical story and you've got what Disney is constantly on the lookout for. Unfortunately (for them) it's a story that I don't think would translate well for the markets they're catering for. But I digress, here is a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts on the matter.Satsuki and Mei have moved house with their father so they can be near their mother who is in hospital. Their new house is in the countryside next to a forest. The girls have great fun exploring and when Satsuki has to go to school Mai goes off on her own. She discovers some magical forest creatures, Totoro's, one of which is of massive proportions! Soon Satsuki sees him too and they have many adventures together. But when Mei gets lost and Satsuki has exhausted every other avenue of help, it's to Totoro that she turns Can he help her find her little sister? Well, I guess I had better not tell you that or the Spoiler Police (Ghibli Division) will be revoking my viewing rights (again).Beautifully animated with great attention to detail, I really love the way this film looks. I watched it in Japanese with subtitles and I didn't mind one bit, it's a really easy plot to follow and so not too taxing on the little grey cells. I will give honourable mentions to the voice talents of; Noriko Hidaka as Satsuki, Chika Sakamoto as Mei, Shigesato Itoi as Tatsuo Kusakabe (the father) and Sumi Shimamoto as Yasuko Kusakabe (the mother).A simple story is the backbone of this film; the magical world of Totoro really makes it a terrific watch. On the downside, I did find the girls voices tended to get a little grating towards the end most of their dialogue seems to be SHOUTED! Apart from that, I found it beautiful to look at with a quite magical tale, not a lot to dislike here Recommended.My score: 8.6/10.IMDb Score: 8.2/10 (based on 47,047 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 90/100 (based on 29 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

500 Days of Summer," One for the fallen romantics
","Deep down I'm a bit of a romantic that's been burned a time or several and so it was nice to find a film like this. It's not you're usual 'boy meets girl – they fall in love and live happily ever after' type of tale, no, it's much more realistic than that but with a large dose of quirkiness thrown in. I can't say it's my favourite romantic film, but it would probably make a top ten. But I digress, here's a bit about the plot first.Tom Hansen is working for a greetings card company when Summer Finn starts to work there. He is, of course, attracted to her but is afraid to make the first move. His friends, McKenzie and Paul, persuade him to talk to her at a karaoke night and one thing leads to another. She tells him that she does not want a boyfriend and he agrees to just keep it light. But as time passes, it's clear that Tom is struggling not knowing where he is with her. He even asks advice from his street-wise little sister, Rachel. It seems the relationship is doomed when Summer leaves her job, and also Tom. He is heartbroken, but they are destined to meet again more than once.The story is told in a rather unusual way; we start near the end of the 500 days and then jump back to the beginning. This continues throughout the film which meant the audience has to keep watching or they could get easily lost. I found it a different and refreshing way to put the narrative on the screen. Decent performances all round, so honourable mentions go to; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom Hansen, Zooey Deschanel as Summer Finn, Geoffrey Arend as McKenzie, Chloe Moretz as Rachel Hansen and Matthew Gray Gubler as Paul.There are a lot of comparisons I can draw with other films; for instance, the character of Summer reminded me very much of Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961). There is a musical number performed in the street featuring Tom that could be from any musical you could name. At the end of the day I found it a very entertaining film, although Summer was a little irritating at times. But forgiving that, it's pretty much recommended.My score: 7.9/10",8,1,2,26 September 2010
The Prestige," Excellent again from Nolan!
","For the record, I have seen this film before, but this is the first time I've attempted a review. I will admit to being a growing fan of Christopher Nolan's work, ever since the excellent 'Inception' last year I have tried to see all of his work whenever possible. Although not perfect, this is a fine example of his work, a beautifully crafted story that is both compelling and very mysterious. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please enjoy the magic show while I write the next paragraph).Every great magic trick consists of three acts; 'The Pledge', 'The Turn' and 'The Prestige'. Now, I could tell you what they all mean, but Michael Caine does it so much better in the trailer. But I digress; we're here to talk about the plot. Two magicians, Alfred Borden and Robert Angier are working together when tragedy strikes. Angier's wife, Julia, is killed in an on-stage accident. He blames Borden for her death and thus begins a bitter rivalry. They both set out alone to be the better magician and both make every effort to thwart the other. Eventually Borden creates a trick that Angier cannot figure out and from then it's no holds barred. In search of the answer he goes to America to seek the help of scientist Nikola Tesla. What he creates for Angier is quite mind-blowing and very dangerous. But the secret to Borden's trick is not what you may think. I think I've said enough and so I'll leave it there.As you might expect from a Christopher Nolen film, it is very well made with great cinematography, great sets, costumes and, not least, performances. Great work from both Christian Bale as Alfred Borden and Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, both are superb in this one. Also great to see were Michael Caine as Cutter and Scarlett Johansson as Olivia Wenscombe. And I must give honourable mentions to Andy Serkis as Alley and David Bowie (yes him) as Tesla.I have seen this one before and so could remember a good portion of the plot while re-watching it. Even so, I found it quite compelling; I love the way the audience are drawn into the story. It may not have the scope of The Dark Knight or Inception, and it may not be quite as crazy as Memento, but it's still a great example of his work. As I said at the beginning, it's not perfect, I felt some of the early scenes were a little rushed and a little more time could have been spent on 'The Pledge' without ruining 'the Prestige' (just a little magician joke there). Over all, very compelling, excellently made with some great performances Highly Recommended.My score: 8.6/10",9,0,2,27 February 2011
Once," A Bittersweet Romance with Some Really Great Songs...
","I remember this film winning the Oscar in 2008 for Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Song. The song was called 'Falling Slowly' and I recall seeing a clip from the film of the song being played live on guitar and piano in a music shop. It didn't have a wide release here in the UK, but thanks to digital TV, I have finally got round to seeing it. I wasn't disappointed; it's a really good film with some truly great songs, so great in fact that I bought the soundtrack! Set in Dublin it tells the story of a busker and the immigrant Czech girl he meets.One evening the Guy, the busker, is playing one of his own compositions when he meets the Girl, we never know their names. She says she's seen him before, but not playing his own songs. He says that during the day people won't pay to hear his own songs so he plays well known songs instead. The get talking and she meets him the following day when she takes him to a music store where she's allowed to play piano for an hour a day. She persuades him to play one of his songs, 'Falling Slowly', and she accompanies him on piano. The story goes on to tell how the relationship between the two is affected by events in the past. I really don't want to give too much away because it's so much better to watch when you don't know too much about it.Tremendous musical performances from both Glen Hansard as the Guy and Markéta Irglová as the Girl, although I don't think speaking dialogue really came naturally to either of them. Honourable mentions go to Hugh Walsh as Timmy Drummer, Gerard Hendrick as Lead Guitarist, Alaistair Foley as Bassist, Geoff Minogue as Eamon, Bill Hodnett as Guy's Dad and Danuse Ktrestova as Girl's Mother.Over all, a really engaging film with some really great music. If you love ballads, then I can guarantee you a most enjoyable watch. Most of the music is either played live or is integrated really well into the narrative. In fact this bittersweet tale is mostly told through the songs which are interspersed with short pieces of dialogue. If you're not a romantic or a lover of music, then this is probably not for you. However, it's definitely recommend for music lovers and romantics alike.My score: 8.2/10",8,2,4,20 March 2010
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," A slow-burner that really hits the mark!...
","Having seen the critical acclaim this has got I had to see it when it finally landed at The Picture House, my local cinema. I remember the TV adaptation of this John le Carré novel, starring Alec Guinness, being aired, but I never really watched it at the time. So it was all new to me and I have to say I was impressed. It's not for everyone, it has quite a slow pace and there are no frenetic fight scenes, chase sequences or gun battles, it's all very calm. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.It is the 1970's and the cold war with Russia is at its height. Control has had word that there is a double agent at the top of the organisation and decides to leave, taking George Smiley with him. Some time later, Control is dead and George is asked to come back to find out who the mole is. He enlists the help of Peter Guillam, an agent, and former Special Branch Police officer, Mendel. The suspects are; Percy Alleline, Bill Haydon, Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase. The investigation begins by looking at an incident in Budapest involving another agent, Jim Prideaux, who was shot by Russian agents. Another source of information is Ricki Tarr who comes to George wanting to trade what he knows for the life of a Russian woman he has fallen for. There are plots within plots in this very complicated story and there's no way I'm gonna give the game away or the Spoiler Police will have me marched off to Siberia as quickly as I can say 'spy'.Beautifully shot with really sharp imagery, I'm always impressed by that when I see a film on the big screen. The incidental music was good, but, for me, there wasn't enough of it many long silences in the dialogue. Moving on to performances, well, I have to say that Gary Oldman as George Smiley was superb! He really nailed it and went up a great deal in my estimation. I also thought the performances of; Tom Hardy as Ricki Tarr, John Hurt as Control, Mark Strong as Jim Prideaux and Benedict Cumberbatch as Peter Guillam were all most excellent! I really hope at least one of them gets an Oscar if not a BAFTA. Oh, it was also nice to see an appearance from Kathy Burke as Connie Sachs.As I said at the beginning, this film will not suit everyone, it had a very complicated plot and it's one you really have to concentrate on or you'll miss something. Concentration was quite hard at the viewing I was at because it was quite hot and stuffy in there. Not to worry, I stayed awake for the duration and really enjoyed what I saw. It's the kind of film, I think, you might have to watch a few times to get the little nuances put in there, little clues to the identity of the mole. Some of it is told in flashback and it can be a little confusing at times figuring out whether it's a flashback or not It certainly keeps you on your toes! I will certainly be seeing this again at some point. So, for those that like a good cold war thriller, a slow burning plot with many twists and turns, then this one comes very highly recommended.My score: 9.1/10 IMDb Score: 708/10 (based on 2,892 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 97/100 (based on 38 reviews counted when this review was written).",9,2,5,2 October 2011
Catch-22," Crazy, anarchic and compelling An interesting take on Joseph Heller's novel
","This is a film I saw many years ago I didn't really understand it then and so I thought I'd give it another look (having matured a bit in the meantime). I must say it's very weird, anarchic at times and has a lot to say politically it's also quite compelling. Based on Joseph Heller's famous novel which, I have to confess, I've never read so you'll be getting my opinion of the film as a stand-alone piece. But enough of my prattling; let's have a crack at a synopsis before I give you my thoughts.Whilst flying missions in Italy during World War II, Capt. John Yossarian decides he wants out and tries to get himself certified insane But there's a catch Catch-22 to be precise. I won't tell you exactly how it works here; but needless to say, it's a pretty cunning way of keeping the boys flying. We also meet all of his crew and the locals they associate with when not on duty. There are also those who are out for themselves; Col. Cathcart, Maj. Danby and 1st Lt. Milo Minderbinder to name but a few. All this is interspersed with flashbacks to Yossarian's efforts to help a young airman who is injured on a mission. I really don't want to say too much, it's one of those you have to see for yourself to get a grasp of. Also, the Spoiler Police will be selling off all my stuff.This is an interesting film that has a lot to say about many things; not least war and capitalism. I won't go into the political questions it raises, but needless to say the point is put across quite forcibly. Decent performances all round, particularly from Alan Arkin as Capt. John Yossarian; he did a first rate job here! Honourable mentions go to; Martin Balsam as Col. Cathcart, Richard Benjamin as Maj. Danby, Art Garfunkel as Capt. Nately, Jack Gilford as Dr. 'Doc' Daneeka, Buck Henry as Lt. Col. Korn, Bob Newhart as Maj. Major Major, Anthony Perkins as Chaplain Capt. A.T. Tappman, Paula Prentiss as Nurse Duckett, Martin Sheen as 1st Lt. Dobbs and Jon Voight as 1st Lt. Milo Minderbinder. Finally a special mention for Orson Welles who played a brilliant cameo as Brig. Gen. Dreedle.Although I found this film entertaining, I did find it did drag on a bit towards the end. About 20 minutes shorter and it would have been ideal (for me). It's all very well shot, but I'm afraid it suffers from having the feel of some 'Frat-house' comedy which didn't really endear it to me too much. That aside, I did find parts of it were quite compelling although I did struggle to have much empathy with any of the characters even the lead. For its day though I thought it was quite groundbreaking and quite an eye-opener (in more ways than one). At the end of the day an interesting adaptation I'll have to read the book sometime.My score: 6.9/10.IMDb Score: 7.1/10 (based on 10,995 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 87/100 (based on 23 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 62/100 (based on 9,365 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",7,1,2,22 January 2012
The Expendables," Great action sequences but ultimately disappointing.
","As a male of the species I am not averse to the odd action movie, they're (usually) not too taxing on the brain, there's lots of explosions, and, if we're lucky, there's a pretty girl to be rescued. Well, 'The Expendables' ticks all those boxes and more. With cameo's from both Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger this was one I really wasn't gonna miss. But here's a bit about the plot before I tell you my thoughts.The Expendables are a group of mercenaries led by Barney Ross who are hired by a Mr Church to assassinate the dictator of the small island state of Vilena. Whilst staking out the job, Ross and his associate, Lee Christmas, meet a rebel leader called Sandra, who just happens to be the daughter of the island's dictator, General Garza. Just to add a bit more to the mix, the General is being helped by a rogue CIA agent, James Munroe, ably assisted by his henchman, Paine. The two men leave the island in a hail of bullets leaving Sandra behind. She is captured and tortured by Munroe but The Expendables are on their way to the rescue. There is a lot more to the plot, but I don't want to give too much away.The action sequences were all very well done and very gory. There were plenty of explosions and stunts that, again, were all very nicely pulled off. I guess the thing that let this film down the most was the dialogue. It seemed to get a bit bogged down at times when you just want them to get on with the action. And the final third of the film has plenty of that! Decent performances though from all of the major cast, so honourable mentions go to Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas, Jet Li as Ying Yang, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen, Eric Roberts as James Munroe, Randy Couture as Toll Road, Steve Austin as Paine, David Zayas as General Garza and Giselle Itié as Sandra.I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up slightly disappointed. Even a decent soundtrack, ending with 'The Boys are Back in Town' by Thin Lizzy couldn't make up for its lack of depth. Stallone has produced some great films in the past but unfortunately this one just falls short of the mark. I feel I'm being a little generous with my score, but the action sequences were very good and I can't forget that. So, if you like a lot of explosions, a damsel in distress and a crack mercenary team coming to the rescue, then this one is most definitely recommended. Otherwise maybe not.My score: 5.8/10",6,3,9,21 August 2010
Megamind," Famous voices Animation Superheroes Crazy comedy antics Who could ask for more?
","This is another of those blockbuster animated films that uses the voices of famous stars to sell it. Well that's what I was led to believe from the hype anyway. At the end of the day I decided it wasn't all that bad. As far as I'm concerned, anyone could be supplying the voices in this one; it's the writing that makes it (for me). I'm sure contributions were made by those involved, but the basic storyline would have remained the same and it's the story that holds the thing together. Of course I was also immune to the 3D because I watched it in exactly the same number of dimensions the screen has. But I digress, here's a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts.With their planets doomed, two babies are sent towards Earth. One lands at a mansion and is brought up in a privileged home. He has superpowers and grows up to be the good guy: Metro Man. The other, well he lands in a prison, has no superpowers, but a genius mind and he becomes the bad guy: Megamind. The pair have many battles over the years with Metro Man always finishing with the upper hand. But this time it would be different; this time Megamind has a particularly evil plan. He kidnaps Metro Man's girlfriend, reporter Roxanne Ritchie, and lures Metro Man to his doom. But will the destruction of Metro Man give Megamind everything he wants? Well, I'm afraid the Spoiler Police would really not like me telling you that and anyway, they've threatened me with the 'forget-me stick' if I tell.The animation is up to DreamWorks' usual standard, nothing particularly extraordinary about it really. I love the soundtrack, but then again, put AC/DC, Ozzy Osbourne and Guns 'n' Roses in there and I'm yours! (I saw at least two of them in the same bill once). Performance wise, well everyone did a decent job, so I'll give honourable mentions to the voice talents of; Will Ferrell as Megamind, Tina Fey as Roxanne Ritchie, Brad Pitt as Metro Man, Jonah Hill as Hal Stewart/ Titan, David Cross as Minion and Ben Stiller as Bernard.The whole story is told from the point of view of Megamind which makes for an interesting dynamic. You end up sympathising with the bad guy and that, I guess, is what makes the whole thing work. I liked the storyline, but I suspect it may have been a little too complicated for younger members of the audience. They also fall into the trap of putting little nods to older films so the parents don't get bored, I suppose, and this is all getting a little cliché Hollywood. Still, it's pretty entertaining over all and one that's worth a look 'Recommended'.My score: 7.3/10.IMDb Score: 7.3/10 (based on 50,452 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 72/100 (based on 170 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

The Town," A very enjoyable multi-layered crime drama...
","Made in a very realistic style which, as with his directorial debut, 'Gone Baby Gone' (2007), matches the mood of the piece really well. All the performances were excellent, but I particularly liked Rebecca Hall as Claire Keesey, Jeremy Renner as James Coughlin and Blake Lively as his sister, Krista Coughlin; all three put in sterling performances. Of course, Ben Affleck proved once again what a fine actor he is as Doug MacRay. Also worthy of note were; Jon Hamm as FBI S.A. Adam Frawley, Slaine as Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan, Owen Burke as Desmond Elden, Titus Welliver as Dino Ciampa and finally a mention for Pete Postlethwaite as 'The Florist', Fergus 'Fergie' Colm in one of his last roles.A complicated plot that's quite heavy on dialogue in places, but there are some very nicely put together action scenes in there too. There are several threads to the story that all tie up in the end, although the poignant ending does leave the audience guessing to some extent. I must say I did enjoy this film with its multi-layered plot and, at times, edgy style. It's certainly one I would give another viewing to at some point in the future Recommended.My score: 8.3/10.IMDb Score: 7.6/10 (based on 118,712 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 94/100 (based on 210 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 83/100 (based on 110,251 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,0,18 March 2012
Taxi Driver," De Niro and Scorsese at their very best
","A really well made film with all the hard edges you'd expect from a gritty 1970's drama. I love the look and feel of it and it's all nicely knitted together with a hauntingly melodic musical score by Bernard Herrmann.This is a film that many have given high praise to and I can see why. It has everything you would want from a drama; not only is a story that sucks you in, but the performances are so good they make you believe in the characters. It does seem a little flat here and there, but you never really know just what's going to happen next and I loved every minute of it!...

Shutter Island," A mystery thriller with a twist...
","I am quite a fan of the work of Martin Scorsese and as such I really wanted to enjoy this film. Unfortunately it didn't quite hit the mark for me. I try very hard not to compare any director's work with their previous efforts, mainly because we never really know what difficulties they faced in making any particular film. So I won't harp on about how it doesn't compare with 'Goodfellas', or it's not as good as 'The Aviator' or 'The Departed' as I feels that's unfair, I'll let it stand alone as a single piece of work.It is 1953 and Teddy Daniels is a US Marshall who, along with his new partner, Chuck Aule, has been sent to Shutter Island to investigate then disappearance of one of the patients at a mental asylum there. They are met with a frosty reception and the mysterious Dr. Cawley and Dr. Naehring who seem to be hiding something. They find a clue, a note left by the escaped patient indicating a mysterious 67th patient at the facility that nobody will admit to the existence of. A storm prevents them leaving the island when the escaped patient, Dolores Chanal, mysteriously turns up out of the blue. Teddy is being increasingly troubled by flashbacks to the death of his wife in a fire several years earlier and also his experiences in World War II. Believing that there is a lot more than meets the eye, Teddy and Chuck set out to get to the bottom of things. I'll leave my short synopsis there; don't want to give too much away! A beautifully well made film, I cannot fault the cinematography at all. There were one or two continuity errors I spotted, but I'll let them slide. Really good performances from all of the major cast members, honourable mentions go to Leonardo DiCaprio as Teddy Daniels, Mark Ruffalo as Chuck Aule, Ben Kingsley as Dr. Cawley, Max von Sydow as Dr. Naehring and Michelle Williams as Dolores Chanal.The film is made in the film noir style, and as such there a lot of scenes with quite a lot of dialogue. This is fine when the dialogue moves the story along, but I found in a lot of cases, these scenes were beautifully shot, but that was it, they didn't particularly add much else to the story. It's not a bad film for all that, there is a really good twist at the end, it just failed to meet my expectations at the end of the day. If you love film noir then by all means go and see it, otherwise I'm afraid you may be disappointed.My score: 6.8/10",7,0,2,14 March 2010
Tangled," Animated fun from those Disney guys Better than I was expecting!... :)
","I thought I'd start my day off with something easy to watch, given a bit of a rough head this morning. Checking what I had recorded, I decided the one that would be easiest on the grey matter was 'Tangled'. I was right I was also delighted with my choice! Nothing like as bad as I was expecting, although it wasn't perfect, Disney have come a long way in the last few years and appear to be on the right track to producing something really great in the next few years. But enough of my nonsense for now More after this very brief summary.Having been kidnapped by Mother Gothel as a baby, Rapunzel is kept away from the world in a hidden tower. The only way in or out is to climb up her long golden hair. It is her magical hair that holds the secret to why Mother Gothel stole Rapunzel away but I'm not going to tell you about that here. Just as Rapunzel is about to turn eighteen, a man, Flynn Rider climbs the tower trying to evade some palace guards who are chasing him. He has stolen something from the palace and they want it back. Each year on her birthday the sky is filled with magical lanterns and Rapunzel wants more than anything to go and see them. But Mother Gothel has made her afraid to go outside. Can she persuade Flynn to take her to see the lanterns and, more importantly, can she overcome her fears of the outside world. I think that's enough to whet your appetite for now don't want the Spoiler Police chasing me down and throwing me in a dungeon again.Beautifully animated with some really great songs (& some not quite so great) to take you along the journey. This is a really well made family film with some really nice touches. The voice talents of Mandy Moore as Rapunzel and Zachary Levi as Flynn Rider were both excellent. I thought Donna Murphy played the evil Mother Gothel very well, particularly the songs. Honourable mentions go to the voice talents of; Ron Perlman as Stabbington Brother, M.C. Gainey as Captain of the Guard, Jeffrey Tambor as Big Nose Thug, Brad Garrett as Hook Hand Thug, Paul F. Tompkins as Short Thug and Richard Kiel as Vlad.The comic relief was supplied by a horse, Maximus and a chameleon, Pascal. There is also a band of thugs who help the unlikely pair on their journey; they have the best musical number in the show (IMO). In fact, this film did have the ring of an old fashioned musical about it and I must admit, I did enjoy that aspect of it. On the down side, I thought everyone looked a little bit too 'Disney cute' for my liking. The eyes way too big and the waistlines way too thin it doesn't look right (to me) I'm afraid. That aside, I did enjoy this film (in 2D) though Recommended.My Score: 7.7/10.IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 60,662 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 89/100 (based on 179 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",Null,1,3,28 October 2011
Full Metal Jacket," A classic!!...
","This film was on the TV in a pub I was frequenting last week. Being one of my all time favourites I was hopeful there was going to be a repeat showing. Fortunately the same channel obliged and I was able to record it for a viewing today. For me it is one of the three iconic films about the Vietnam War; the others being Apocalypse Now (1979) and Platoon (1986). I'm sure others will be mentioned in dispatches, but these are the three that have served me best. It is a film of two parts.The first part deals with the training of a group of U.S. Marine recruits under the watchful eye of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman. Among the platoon are characters Hartman calls Private Joker, Private Cowboy and, the focus of much of his scorn, Private Pyle. Unfortunately Private Pyle isn't really cut out to be a Marine and keeps making mistakes. It gets so bad that Hartman begins to take it out on the platoon whenever he screws up. This has a rather disastrous effect on Pyle and it doesn't end well for more than one of them.With training over the focus now switches to the theatre of action in Vietnam. We follow Private Joker who has become a journalist working for 'Stars and Stripes' magazine as a combat correspondent. He is sent into the combat zone with his photographer, Rafterman, where he joins up with a platoon that contains his old friend Private Cowboy. They are sent into a built up area to clear out any enemy combatants hiding inside. Having been pinned down by a sniper, it's up to Private Cowboy to figure a way out of the situation. I'll leave you hanging there, if you have seen the film, you'll know what happens, if you haven't well, it's just a little incentive for you to give it a look.Stanley Kubrick had a great eye for detail and looking at this film you can see that every little detail is perfect. I love the look and the feel of it, even though it is of two very distinct and very different parts. Great performances all round; in particular Matthew Modine as Pvt. Joker, Vincent D'Onofrio (who some of you may know from TV's Law and Order: Criminal Intent) as Pvt. Pyle and R. Lee Ermey as Gny. Sgt. Hartman. Also worthy of note were; Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother, Dorian Harewood as Eightball, Kevyn Major Howard as Rafterman and Arliss Howard as Pvt. Cowboy.I will admit that I, like most people I know, enjoyed the first part slightly more than the second. I think it's because it has many more memorable, even iconic, scenes in it. But in defence of the second part, it was a hard act to follow! Having said that, the second part does deal with the gritty realities of war and goes some way towards satirising it. I should note there is an excellent soundtrack and the use of various songs throughout is well balanced against the visuals. Over all, a near-perfect war film (IMO) and one which comes very highly recommended.My Score: 9.6/10",10,0,2,18 June 2011
Léon: The Professional," Rapidly becoming a classic
","As this is my 100th film of the year I decided I would watch one of my all-time favourites. I have not seen Leon in quite a few years and so it was nice to become reacquainted with this classic. It's not perfect, I know, but, to me, it will always be one of Luc Besson's best.Leon is a loner and a hit-man; he lives in an apartment in New York next door to the twelve year old Mathilda and her family. He gets his work from Italian mob boss, Tony. Mathilda's father is into some shady drug dealings that land him in trouble with the rather psychotic Stansfield and his gang. She is out getting groceries when Stansfield calls and shoots her entire family. On returning she takes refuge in Leon's apartment. Despite initial reservations, Leon takes her in and they move to a hotel. Mathilda swears revenge on the killers, mainly because one of the victims was her four-year-old brother. She asks Leon to teach her to do what he does for a living. Leon teaches her the basics and the pair grows closer as they learn to live with each other. Mathilda teaches him to read and he begins to not feel quite so lonely any more. On a visit to her former home Mathilda learns just who Stansfield is and what he does for a living. This is where things really get interesting, and this is where I will end my short synopsis.This is a really well made film with a great soundtrack, there are a couple of songs, but the original score is great. As with all the Luc Besson films I've seen there is always an element of humour in the main characters and this is no different. Tremendous performances from both Jean Reno as Leon and Natalie Portman as Mathilda. Gary Oldman is his usual 'over the top' self as the psychotic Stansfield and Danny Aiello is also very good as Tony.I really engaged with the characters of Leon and Mathilda. You really believe that what they feel for each other is true. There is always a certain sense of style about a Luc Besson film, something I have not seen in the films of any other director. As I said at the beginning, this film is not perfect, but it will always be one of my favourites. It still stands up fifteen years after its release. For me: always recommended.My score: 8.5/10",9,1,2,27 July 2010
Watchmen," A great movie... Just a little too long...
","First of all, I must say that I have not read the graphic novel by Dave Gibbons and Alan Moore. With that out of the way I can now get on with the business in hand. It's kind of weird watching this film, its set in 1985, but not a 1985 that we would recognise. For a start Richard Nixon is president of the United States, there's a lot of tension between the US and the USSR, oh and there are superheroes about (seemingly only in America though). These superheroes have been discredited and are banned from wearing their disguises. So most have gone into retirement, hoping to keep their identities secret.It is night and one of the superheroes, The Comedian, a.k.a., is disturbed by a knock at the door. A man comes in and a fight ensues, a fight that culminates in the death of The Comedian. The following day, another Superhero, Rorschach begins to investigate the murder. He calls on Nite Owl II, a.k.a. Dan Dreiberg, and also Dr. Manhattan, a.k.a. Jon Osterman and Silk Spectre II, a.k.a. Laurie Jupiter, looking for information but he seems to be getting nowhere. The story is broken up with lots of flashbacks giving us the background to each of these characters, some of which are descendants from previous Superheroes. We also meet Ozymandias, a.k.a. Adrian Veidt, a Superhero who has revealed his identity and is working to find a cheap energy source for the world. It's a very complicated plot, so I won't go any further, you have the bare bones of it there And no spoilers so far! A really well made film with some really great special effects, CGI and some brilliant fight sequences, hats off to the stunt guys for that. It's visually quite stunning as well, I don't know a lot about the technical side of cinematography, but, for me, they got this one just right! Decent performances from all of the main cast, honourable mentions go to Malin Akerman as Laurie Jupiter / Silk Spectre II, Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan / Jon Osterman, Matthew Goode as Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias, Jackie Earle Haley as Walter Kovacs / Rorschach, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Edward Blake / The Comedian and Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II.It's a really interesting film with a lot of philosophy and politics and some really dark comedy thrown in. I found it quite enjoyable, although it was just too long; if it had been cut to two hours I feel it would have been better. So, overall, a really enjoyable film with some great action and effects, only let down by its length, even so, I still recommend it to you.My score: 7.9/10",8,0,3,9 March 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Still going strong!
","I chose to go and see this on a cold damp Tuesday evening because I remember a bad experience watching the previous Harry Potter last year. I foolishly went on the Saturday of the opening week and the cinema was packed. It wasn't until the interval that I finally managed to threaten the teenager behind me enough to stop him kicking my seat all through the second half. But that was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away I must take some of my pills. Here's a very brief summary before I tell you what I thought of this one (summary haters please hide the chosen one in a forest while I write the next paragraph).Lord Voldemort and his followers have taken over the Ministry of Magic and are hot on the trail of Harry Potter. Those loyal to him try to move him to a safer location, but they are betrayed and some of their number are killed or injured. After a further attack Harry, Ron and Hermione escape and decide to go it alone. They have discovered that one of the remaining Horcruxes is at the Ministry. Posing as three of the members of the Ministry they manage to steal the Horcrux, but have no way of destroying it. In his will, Dumbledor has left each of them an item that could help. Harry has been bequeathed the snitch he captured in his first game of quidditch as well as the Sword of Gryffindor which is currently lost. Hermione discovers that it is possible that the Sword could destroy the Horcrux. A mysterious light leads Harry to the sword and they are able to destroy the Horcrux. There a three more to be found and Lord Voldemort is becoming more and more powerful as time goes on. I have missed an awful lot out, but those are the salient points and, I hope, very few (if any) spoilers.As we have come to expect, this is a beautifully made film, although much darker than the others. It was nice to see the three main characters out in the real world for a change. I love the animation that was used for the explanation of the meaning of the Deathly Hallows, beautifully done! Great performances all round, particularly from Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Rupert Grint as Ron and Emma Watson as Hermione. All are growing into fine actors.As you may notice from reading my summary (assuming you weren't hiding in a forest), that a knowledge of all of the previous six episodes does help when watching this instalment. I did find it a bit hard to get into at first, but was soon enthralled again. The scenes in the ministry did remind me a little of Terry Gilliam's 1985 film Brazil and there are more than hits of 'The Lord of the Rings' throughout. Over all, a very good film and one I heartily recommend.My score: 8.3/10",8,0,0,23 November 2010
Knowing," Exciting & mysterious but just a little too long...
","I have heard many mixed reviews about this film, so it was with a little trepidation I put the disc in the DVD player. I shouldn't have worried, I can see why the reviews are mixed, but over all it's not all that bad. Admittedly, it could have been done a lot better, but I'll accept it as it stands. The setting is Massachusetts in the United States and we start in the year 1959.Lucinda Embry is a loner and she hears whispering voices that she doesn't talk about. To celebrate the opening of a new school it is decided that they will bury a time capsule at Lucinda's suggestion. All of the class are to draw pictures of what they think life will be like in 50 years time, when the capsule will be opened. Lucinda just writes down numbers and her teacher, exasperated, puts her effort in anyway. On the day the capsule is buried Lucinda goes missing and is eventually found in a basement closet scratching more numbers into the door. We now switch to Massachusetts of the present day (2009) where MIT professor, John Koestler lives alone with his son Caleb. It just happens that Caleb attends the same school that Lucinda went to 50 years before. On the day of the opening of the capsule Caleb is handed Lucinda's envelope, which he takes home. John sees the numbers and is intrigued by them. He works out that the numbers represent disasters that have happened in the past, along with the number of fatalities and the location. The trouble is, there are three events that are yet to happen! He tries to find Lucinda, but she had died some time ago, but she had a daughter, Diana Wayland. John eventually tracks Diana down; she too has a daughter, Abby. As the predictions from Lucinda's numbers come true, John realises what the last event will be and what the consequences are for the entire human race. I think that's enough spoilers for one day! It's a very well made film with a lot of use of CGI, possibly too much IMHO. There's plenty of excitement to keep the tempo up and quite a decent soundtrack. An element of mystery kept me interested until the end, but I did find it a little too long. Decent performances from all of the major players, honourable mentions go to Nicolas Cage as Professor Jonathan 'John' Koestler, Chandler Canterbury as Caleb Koestler, Rose Byrne as Diana Wayland and Lara Robinson as Abby Wayland & Lucinda Embry.It's not the best film of its genre, but it's certainly not the worst. I found it pretty entertaining and the mystery of the 'strangers' kept me enthralled (I know I didn't mention them earlier). Over all, it's a little over long and relies a little too heavily on CGI, but apart from that it's not all that bad. Recommended for entertainment & mystery, but you'll probably only watch it once.My score: 7.1/10",7,1,4,14 April 2010
The Shining," A great collaboration between Kubrick and King...
","I have seen 'The Shining' a couple of times before but I never realised just what a great film it is until this time around. I guess watching it late at night after many beers can take away the impact of it somewhat though. This time, its morning, I'm a little hung over but nothing a good strong cup of coffee and a decent breakfast couldn't cure! I have to admit I haven't read the Stephen King novel on which it is based, but it is on my reading list. As a fan of the work of both Mr King and indeed Mr Kubrick I was more than thrilled to see this collaboration. More of my thoughts after this brief summary.The Overlook Hotel is in a very remote part of Colorado high up in the Rocky Mountains. So high up in fact that it is shut down every winter because the roads become impassable. To this end a caretaker is employed to look after the place during the winter months. This time around it is writer Jack Torrance along with his wife, Wendy and young son, Danny that gets the job. Before he starts, Jack is told of an incident a few years back where one of his predecessors had gone mad and murdered his family before unloading a shotgun into himself. Jack is not put off; he is looking forward to the solitude so he can work on his new novel. Oh, I should point out that young Danny has a special gift, one that doesn't go unnoticed by chef, Dick Hallorann before he leaves. Things start out well and the family soon settles into a routine. Danny goes off riding his trike around the long halls of the hotel while Jack writes and Wendy tends to the everyday maintenance tasks. When Danny starts to see things, (two strange girls), and Jack begins to lose his cool, it becomes apparent to Wendy that all is not what it seems at the Overlook Hotel. I'll leave it there as I'm sure there are one or two out there that may not have seen this one. And anyway, the Spoiler Police will be locking me in a store room if I say much more.The film is brilliantly shot with some truly iconic scenes and some beautiful scenery to balance it up. I must also say the music by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind really added to the mood and gave the film an extra dimension. Brilliant performances all round, particularly from Jack Nicholson, chewing the furniture and really letting rip as Jack Torrance and from Shelley Duvall as the put-upon wife Wendy Torrance. I also have to give a shout out for the young Danny Lloyd who coped really well with the (at times) demanding role of Danny. Finally, honourable mentions go to Scatman Crothers as Dick Hallorann, Barry Nelson as Stuart Ullman, Philip Stone as Delbert Grady and Joe Turkel as Lloyd the Bartender.Stanley Kubrick was a master of storytelling and also a master of the visual arts. I loved the look and feel of this film but, just occasionally, I found the dialogue got a little bogged down. It was almost as if it was lifted straight from the novel and didn't flow quite as well as it might. I can forgive that though because the film as a whole really works and I must give credit to all the filmmakers for that! Most definitely one I will watch again (without the irritation of commercials next time) and one that comes highly recommended.My Score: 9.1/10.IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 222,736 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 88/100 (based on 49 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",9,0,2,25 September 2011
American Beauty," Excellence...
","I saw this film many years ago and I remember it being rather great. As it came to the top of my list again I decided to give it another go and I'm very glad I did! It's better than great, it's truly excellent! I can't say I've enjoyed a film more in a very long time! Some extraordinary characters, brilliant performances and an excellent script combine to make up one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in the 1990's by far! But enough of my praise, here's a brief summary before I praise it some more.Lester Burnham has a boring job and lives with his wife, Carolyn, and daughter, Jane, in sweet suburbia. Family life is far from happy for any of them; Carolyn is cold to Lester and he finds that hard to take. Jane doesn't find it easy to fit in and thinks her parents are freaks. She has one friend, Angela Hayes, who becomes an object of affection for Lester, much to Jane's disapproval. Things take a turn when teenager, Ricky Fits moves in next door with his repressive father, Col. Frank Fits, USMC and mother, Barbara. Ricky likes to film everything with his video camera and he eventually introduces himself to the Burnham's. He and his father are about to have a big impact on their lives, much bigger than any of them could have imagined. I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be sending me away to an asylum (again).Alongside a, now iconic, musical score by Thomas Newman, there is also a great collection of contemporary songs used in the film. Beautifully made with not one wasted scene, a rare thing these days. As far as performances go, well, nobody put a foot wrong. Kevin Spacey was brilliant as Lester Burnham and Annette Bening played his wife Carolyn to a tee! Thora Birch as Jane Burnham, Wes Bentley as Ricky Fits and Mena Suvari as Angela Hayes were all excellent! I must also give honourable mentions to; Chris Cooper as Col. Frank Fits, USMC, Peter Gallagher as Buddy Kane, Allison Janney as Barbara Fits (I had forgotten she was in it), Scott Bakula as Jim Olmeyer, Sam Robards as Jim Berkley and Barry Del Sherman as Bard Dupree.I think I liked this movie even more this time around. Since I started documenting the films I've watched, I've come to appreciate the filmmakers' art more and more. And I think it is because of this I have a greater appreciation when I see something that I can admire not only for how it makes me feel, but also for the skill of the people that put it out there. It's a film I would recommend to anyone that loves film, it is one of the best films I've seen this year and will easily make my top ten Highly recommended.My Score: 9.3/10.IMDb Score: 8.6/10 (based on 358,207 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 88/100 (based on 152 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",9,1,2,30 October 2011
Salt," A tight espionage thriller...
","I remember when this one came out it got a lot of very mixed reviews. It has finally made it to the small screen and so I thought I'd have a look. It's certainly not as bad as some have said, but equally, it's not all that great either. I think it suffers from what I call the 'Bourne Effect', in that the 'Bourne' films are a pretty hard act to follow and just about every film of that ilk since has failed to hit the mark. Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly watchable but it just falls a bit short of the mark at those all important moments. Here's a brief summary.Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent who is accused by a defector, known as Orlov, of being a Russian spy. She immediately goes on the run trying to get to he husband, Mike, who she believes is in danger. The defector also said that she would assassinate the Russian President at a funeral in New York. Her boss, Ted Winter, and the head of another department, Peabody, are in charge of tracking her down but she gives them the slip more than once. She has a plan and in order to carry it out she may have to compromise herself. I'm not going to say any more because I don't want a sniper picking me off while I'm eating a sandwich.First of all I must say all of the stunt work on this film was first rate, I really enjoyed this aspect of the film very much. Performance wise, I thought Angelina Jolie did a great job as Evelyn Salt, considering the part was originally written for a male (Tom Cruise), I thought she was excellent. Liev Schreiber did a good job as Ted Winter, as did Chiwetel Ejiofor as Peabody and Daniel Olbrychski as Orlov.There are many twists and turns in the plot and, of course, a big twist at the end that I'm afraid I saw coming from a mile off (sorry, no spoilers today). There were a couple of moments where the film did fall a little flat, but the pace was pretty much kept at a fairly high level throughout. I guess where it fails, in comparison with the 'Bourne' films, is that the plot just isn't quite clever enough to give it the edge it needed. But as I said earlier, it's perfectly watchable and suitably entertaining. I also like the fact that it has a female lead that is believable, so many of these films fail in that respect too. So, over all, great action sequences, a believable heroine and quite entertaining, if slightly flawed Still though, recommended.My Score: 6.5/10",7,1,3,26 June 2011
Duck Soup," Classic comedy from the Marx Brothers...
","I'm not a great fan of most modern comedies and so I thought I'd go back a way to see if there was anything funny back in the 1930's. Well I'm pleased to announce that the Marx Brothers were definitely on the right track (IMO). I remember their old films being shown on TV when I was young and I also remember finding their mad-cap humour very entertaining. It was interesting to see them again quite a few years later to and still enjoy them just as much. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.Rufus T. Firefly has been appointed ruler of the cash-strapped state of Freedonia. This tiny country's benefactor, Mrs. Gloria Teasdale, believes passionately in Firefly's abilities. The ambassador of the neighbouring state of Sylvania, Trentino, wants Mrs. Teasdale's money and will go to any lengths to get it. He has one problem though, Mrs. Teasdale only has eyes for Firefly and to this end Trentino sends in his spies, Chicolini and Pinky. This only causes more mayhem and Trentino ends up insulting Firefly who challenges him and it all ends in a declaration of war! Mrs. Teasdale tries to calm things down but they are determined to fight. I'll leave it there so as not to enrage the Spoiler Police.Of course the stars of the show are the Marx brothers; Groucho Marx as Rufus T. Firefly, Harpo Marx as Pinky, Chico Marx as Chicolini and the lesser known Zeppo Marx as Lt Bob Roland - Firefly's aide-de-camp. They are ably supported by; Margaret Dumont who is excellent as Mrs. Gloria Teasdale, Raquel Torres as Vera Marcal and Louis Calhern as Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania.Now, as a coherent story with a narrative, it's all over the place, but I believe this is deliberately done to keep the story moving. Of course, the story is just a means to get to the next one-liner, or sight gag, but it kind of works. Looking deeper into it, the film has quite a satirical message about wealth and power. I really enjoyed it, there were elements that you might see in a more modern Mel Brooks film and some of the routines are truly great, particularly the mirror scene. Over all, recommended.My Score: 7.5/10",8,0,1,23 June 2011
Disturbia," Failed to hit the mark I'm afraid...
","This is one of those films that I really didn't know too much about before hitting the 'Play' button. I had a vague idea from the write-up, but didn't expect what turned up on the screen. What I got was effectively an updated version of Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954). It did have some good aspects to it, but over all I found it quite disappointing. I will explain why after this brief summary.Kale, a high school teenager has had a hard time of it since his father died a year ago. It all comes to a head one day when he punches his Spanish teacher in class. He is sentenced to three months' house arrest. He has to wear an ankle bracelet and if he wanders too far from the house an alert is sent to the police and they will respond immediately. Finding himself home alone most of the time, Kale gets bored and begins to watch the comings and goings of his neighbours. A new family moves in next door and he immediately takes an interest in the daughter, Ashley. His friend Ronnie comes around and they hang out together. They hear a report of a serial killer who may be in the area and Kale's suspicions turn to another of his neighbours, Mr. Turner. He fits the bill perfectly, but how to prove it? Ashley and Ronnie help him, but Turner is getting suspicious and has taken an interest in Kale's mother, Julie. Is Mr. Turner really a serial killer, if so, can they prove it before Kale's mom becomes the next victim? No clues here, this bracelet around my ankle will go off.I thought the plot was OK, but I guess I'm not really the target audience as the focus is very much on the younger members of the cast. Unfortunately Shia LaBeouf was in the leading role of Kale. He really has zero charisma and has very little screen presence (IMO); consequently, I found this one a little hard to watch. Sarah Roemer played Ashley, she did a decent enough job, but appeared to be there mostly as eye-candy. Carrie-Anne Moss played Julie and I was surprised to see her in such a small part she deserves better (IMO). For me, the star turn was David Morse as Mr. Turner, very intimidating but also very charming when needed. Finally, Aaron Yoo was Ronnie, the clown of the piece if you like.As I said at the beginning, I found this film quite disappointing and I think the problem was that I found it very hard to sympathise with any of the characters, particularly Kale. The script seemed to lack any originality and so the whole film suffered as a consequence. It wasn't all bad though, it did have its tense moments and these where handled very well. Over all though, I found it pretty unsatisfying Not recommended.My Score: 5.4/10",5,1,2,15 June 2011
Edward Scissorhands," One of Burton's finest!...
","To me, this is one of Tim Burton's finest works; I must admit I have been less than impressed with his more recent offerings, but he was bang on form the day he came up with this one! A modern fairytale set in what appears to be 1950's American suburbia; everything about it is almost perfect. Everything from the music by Danny Elfman to the effects by Stan Winston is brilliantly done and works so well together. But I digress, here's a brief summary before I heap more praise on this wonderful film.When housewife, and Avon lady, Peg Boggs decides to visit the big ruined house on the hill, she comes back with more than she expected. There she finds a young man, Edward, who, for some inexplicable reason, has scissors for hands. We are told, in flashback, how this came to be; the inventor had made him that way but had sadly died before he could complete his work. Edward is soon the talk of the neighbourhood and when it is discovered that he can do brilliant topiary (hedge clipping) and even cut and style hair, he becomes a bit of a celebrity. He soon grows a fondness for Peg's daughter, Kim, who is going out with local rich kid, Jim. He's a bit of a bully and things are about to turn a bit nasty for Edward. I will leave my summary here or the Spoiler Police will send me back to that draughty house on the hill (again).I love the look and feel of this film; everything seems to fit in the world Burton has created perfectly. With no CGI I think the effects are really great, I'm still trying to figure out how some of it was done! Excellent performances all round and so honourable mentions go to; Johnny Depp as Edward, Winona Ryder as Kim, Dianne Wiest, who I think was really great as Peg, Anthony Michael Hall as Jim, Kathy Baker as Joyce, Alan Arkin as Bill and in one of his last roles, Vincent Price as The Inventor.There is a lot about this film to like, and much I have mentioned already. On the downside though, I did find the plot a little predictable in that there had to be a bad guy, a damsel in distress and a sacrifice. This is the only thing that lets it down. I really like this film and would love to give it a higher score, but I guess the studio had its say in the end. But it's not all that bad; it still comes very highly recommended from me.My score: 8.9/10 IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 143,869 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 91/100 (based on 54 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

The White Ribbon," Sorry, didn't get it!... This time...
","Film critic Mark Kermode describes this as 'A subtitled black and white film about precision anxiety.' Personally, I'm still undecided about it. Maybe I haven't watched enough films yet, but I feel there's something I'm missing here. This film has had a lot of praise, even winning the Palm D'Or at Cannes, but I'm struggling to see why. I'm sure there's someone out there who can explain it to me. But I digress, here's a brief summary before I tell you my thoughts (summary haters please guard the Baron's cabbage patch while I write the next paragraph).It is Germany in 1913, just before the outbreak of World War I. The setting is a small village in northern Germany, a place where the rather straight-laced residents are about to suffer several unfortunate and mystifying events. First off an accident which results in a serious injury to the village doctor has everyone baffled. Then the son of the Baron, who owns much of the land around the village, is kidnapped and beaten by persons unknown. And there are several other events that occur throughout the film, some of which are explained, but others that remain a mystery. I really cant add much more, there are relationship issues involving the doctor and a bit of a burgeoning love story between the teacher (and narrator), and the nanny employed by the Baroness, Eva, but I guess that's all I can say about the plot without giving too much away.Whilst watching the film I have the impression that the children maybe know something about the trouble in the village, but none of them are letting on. I guess it's deliberately left open to interpretation. Decent performances from all of the cast, in particular; Christian Friedel as The School Teacher, Leonie Benesch as Eva, Burghart Klaußner was particularly good as The Pastor and Maria-Victoria Dragus as Klara.I feel a bit bad that I cannot give a higher score, I did want to like this film but it just didn't do anything for me. There are many out there, I'm sure, who totally get this one and I bow to your superior film knowledge. Maybe I will re-visit this one in years to come and see the critically acclaimed film I am supposed to. For now, only recommended for those who get it But I guess you won't know that until you've seen it.My score: 6.2/10",6,1,3,18 December 2010
Monsters vs. Aliens," Not bad... But not great...
","I usually really enjoy animated films and I remember when this one came out last year it had one or two good reviews. So I had some fairly high hopes when I popped the DVD into the player.Outside the church on her wedding day, bride-to-be Susan Murphy gets struck by a meteorite. She looks dazed, but still makes it to the alter. While the ceremony is taking place she begins to grow and grow and grow until she is so big she takes the roof off the church. All of a sudden the military are there in numbers and they drug Susan and take her away to a secret government facility run by General W.R. Monger. Here she meets other monsters, B.O.B., who is a kind of blob, Dr. Cockroach Ph.D., a human/cockroach experiment that went wrong, The Missing Link, who was found in a glacier and the skyscraper-sized mutant larva Insectosaurus. She also gets told her monster name will be Ginormica. The monsters are soon called into action when an alien robot sent by Gallaxhar, a deranged alien overlord, lands on Earth. They defeat the robot only for Gallaxhar himself to come for the resource the robot failed to collect, a resource held by Susan. I think that's enough spoilers for one day.Quite a well made film with some neat animation, but we would expect nothing less from DreamWorks. The plot was okay with some nice jokes thrown in for the adult viewers. Decent performances from all the main cast, so honourable mentions go to the voice talents of; Reese Witherspoon as Susan Murphy / Ginormica, Seth Rogen as B.O.B., Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach Ph.D., Will Arnett as The Missing Link, Kiefer Sutherland as General W.R. Monger and Rainn Wilson as Gallaxhar.I guess I was slightly disappointed with this film, the script was OK but I just didn't really care for any of the characters that much. There seems to be something lacking. Don't get me wrong, the kids will love it, but I guess it's just one of those films that just didn't connect with me. Over all, for the younger viewer, recommended. For the adults, well maybe watch it once (under junior supervision).My score: 5.8/10",6,0,0,27 July 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Just as good as the original.. but for different reasons...
","Having seen the 2009 Swedish version of this film I thought it might be interesting to see how Hollywood treated it. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The location and key elements of the story were kept the same, but obviously a bigger budget allowed for a more cinematic experience. I will give you my thoughts after this brief summary.When journalist and Editor Mikael Blomkvist is sued by a businessman he had written a story about, he finds himself with no savings and a reputation in tatters. Fortunately, an industrialist, Henrik Vanger, wants him to investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, over forty years ago. Before engaging him, Vanger had Blomkvist investigated by a security firm who had used the pierced, tattooed, punk computer hacker Lisbeth Salander as the investigator. We follow Blomkvist's investigation along with events in Lisbeth's life (which are sometimes quite hard to watch). Eventually Blomkvist reaches a point where he needs an assistant and Lisbeth is recommended to him. This is where things start to get really interesting and also the point I will stop my little summary. I don't want the Spoiler Police on my doorstep as 3AM (again).Beautifully shot and very well produced; David Fincher has a well deserved reputation as a filmmaker and it shows. Great performances all round; Daniel Craig did a great job as Mikael Blomkvist, as did Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander, she had a very tough act to follow in Noomi Rapace but I thought she acquitted herself well. Also worth of note were; Christopher Plummer as Henrik Vanger, Stellan Skarsgård as Martin Vanger, Steven Berkoff as Frode, Robin Wright as Erika Berger and Yorick van Wageningen as Bjurman.Having seen the original I cannot but fail to make comparisons and I must say this version is just as good. I say that because I found this one a lot easier to follow, the storyline has been streamlined somewhat. Also, the production is far more elaborate; it obviously had a much bigger budget. As far as performances go though I think the original has the edge; to me Noomi Rapace played the part of Lisbeth Salander so well that anyone else playing that part was going to struggle to top it. Don't get me wrong, Rooney Mara did a fine job and if I hadn't seen Noomi Rapace in the role I may well have been singing her praises. I have given this version the same score as the original and I'm very happy to give it my seal of approval: Recommended.My score: 8.2/10.IMDb Score: 8.2/10 (based on 20,621 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 86/100 (based on 190 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

The Men Who Stare at Goats," It's OK... but not great...
","Having heard the journalist, Jon Ronson, who wrote the book on which this film is based interviewed a couple of times I was intrigued to see this one. Unfortunately, these interviews were all broadcast around the time of the cinema release and I never got the opportunity to see it. Fortunately, it arrived on the BBC just over a year later and so my curiosity was finally satisfied. My thoughts later, but here's a short summary first (summary haters please stare at those goats over there while I write the next paragraph sorry, I couldn't resist that one).When journalist, Bob Wilton, is separated from his wife in 2002, he decides to go to Iraq to prove himself to her. Here he meets Lyn Skip Cassady, an ex-member of the U.S. Army's New Earth Army. What's that I hear you say, well, it's a special unit set up in the 1980's to look into using psychic powers as a means of winning a war. The unit was headed by Bill Django who had spent many years studying the ways of the more free-spirited Americans. As Bob and Lyn travel through Iraq Bob learns more about the work of the unit and how he may be involved in the secret mission Lyn is currently on. In flashback we learn that Lyn had a nemesis back at the unit, Larry Hooper, who was to turn up again before the end of the mission.Although I did find a lot of the humour in this one quite funny, I did find the story a little weak. It's a pretty well made film with some good performances but I felt a little let down by the plot, particularly the end. Performance wise, George Clooney never missed a beat as Lyn Skip Cassady, Ewan McGregor was OK as Bob Wilton, but he wasn't really stretched, Jeff Bridges did a great impression of 'The Dude' as Bill Django and Kevin Spacey again wasn't at all stretched as Larry Hooper.I found it funny that a film starring Ewan McGregor featured an Army unit that called itself 'The Jedi'. And there are plenty of other little jokes like this throughout the film. If it wasn't for George Clooney and Jeff Bridges I guess I would have given a lower score, but they just about pushed it to a 6.5 for me. So, over all, if slightly unsatisfying, it's still worth seeing for Messer's Clooney and Bridges alone Recommended (just).My score: 6.5/10",7,0,2,10 January 2011
Shrek Forever After," A nice end to the franchise...
","I must admit that I have a bit of a soft spot for the Shrek films. I don't know what it is; I guess I just like the brand of humour in them and (for the most part) the likable characters. The third one (I felt) was a bit of a mess, but they appear to have got it nearer the mark for the final instalment until they decide to make some more, that is. I will give you my thoughts after this brief summary sponsored by 'Pete's Potions', available at all major 'Fairy Godmother' outlets nationwide.Shrek is finding it hard to cope with the routine of everyday life, the children, the visitors, the tour bus it's all getting on top of him. This all comes to a head at the kids' first birthday party where he has a big row with Fiona and storms out. He meets Rumpelstiltskin on the road and they start talking about their woes. Not knowing Rumpelstiltskin has an ulterior motive, Shrek signs a contract that sees him projected into an alternate reality, one in which he had never existed until now. He finds that nobody knows him, not Donkey, not Puss in Boots not even Fiona! It then dawns on Shrek that Rumpelstiltskin has conned him. Fortunately there's a get-out clause in the contract, but can he fulfil it before sunrise? Of course, I'm not going to tell you here or them Spoiler Police will have me back on the farm working for that no good Old MacDonald.Favourite Character – Puss in Boots (made me laugh) The animation is just what we've come to expect in these films, and, as usual, it is excellent. Just for reference, I stuck to my principles and watch it in 2D. As usual, some great tunes, particularly at the end, but generally, a decent score. All the usual voice talent was on show, and the all did a good job. So honourable mentions go to; Mike Myers as Shrek, Eddie Murphy as Donkey, Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona and Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots. I should also give a special mention for Walt Dohrn who did the voices for Rumpelstiltskin, Priest and Krekraw Ogre.Favourite Quote – Donkey: 'Wow, that's a big kitty!... Can we keep him?' I'm quite glad this franchise has reached an end, not because I think they're no good any more, but I can see a day when that will be the case. As I've already said, I really get the humour in these films and I wish there were more comedies made in a similar vein. I half expected this one to be awful, if I'm honest, after the let's say less than warm reception it got from the critics. It was a pleasant surprise to find it wasn't all that bad. Yes, the Rumpelstiltskin character needed more development, but I didn't really mind. It entertained me for ninety minutes and that's all you can ask Recommended.My Score: 6.5/10.IMDb Score: 6.6/10 (30,431 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 57/100 (187 reviews counted when this review was written).",Null,0,0,8 August 2011
The Machinist," Excellent stuff... A great modern dark mystery thriller...
","I first saw this film several years ago and I remember being amazed by the performance of Christian Bale. He is so thin it's almost unbelievable that he is able to perform. The film deals with the tricks the mind can play on you and the consequences thereof. But more of that later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please help Miller fix that machine over there while I write the next paragraph).Trevor Reznik has not slept in over a year; he hardly eats and leaves lots of post-it notes all over his apartment to remind him to do things. He works, as the title suggests, as a machinist in a factory where he is just about tolerated by his workmates. He visits a hooker, Stevie, who he confides in and she, looking for a way out of the business, has some affection for him too. Late at night he goes to the airport where he has coffee and has conversations with the waitress, Marie. One day a mysterious stranger turns up at work, a man who calls himself Ivan. And whilst helping Miller fix a machine Trevor gets distracted by Ivan and causes an accident. This eventually leads to his dismissal as he becomes more and more paranoid about Ivan. As he sinks deeper into his paranoia he begins to hallucinate more and more and the line between hallucinations and reality becomes blurred. What is at the root of all this? Well, a resolution is found in the film but you're crazy if you think I'm gonna tell you here.This is a really dark gritty film, very well made with a really great soundtrack that fits the mood perfectly. It almost has the air of film noir about it, or maybe that's just the mood set by the musical score. A really great performance from Christian Bale as Trevor Reznik, how he got so thin I'll never know. Also worth an honourable mention are; Jennifer Jason Leigh as Stevie, Aitana Sánchez-Gijón as Marie, John Sharian as Ivan and Michael Ironside as Miller.I love films that make you think, and this one certainly does that. Yes, at times it does get a little ponderous, but I can forgive that because it does all tie up in the end. So, over all, a well made, dark mystery thriller with a great score and a brilliant performance from Christian Bale Very highly recommended.My score: 8.6/10",9,1,1,8 February 2011
American History X," An enthralling tale of redemption...
","I have to admit that I have seen this film before, but I maybe didn't appreciate it as much before as I did this time around. Everything about it is great, the plot, the dialogue, the performances, the cinematography and the music are all excellent. It maybe wouldn't have been top of my list of films to see due to the subject matter, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. Yes, it does tend to wander a little in the middle and the pacing isn't at top whack, but it is quite compelling viewing all the same.Derek Vinyard was a neo-Nazi when he went into prison for the murder of two thieves at his house. He was the top dog amongst the guys he ran with, all with shaven heads and believing every word of their leader. Words fed to him by the manipulative Cameron Alexander. But something changed in Derek while he was inside, he came out wanting nothing to do with these people any more. He is in fear that his little brother, Danny will follow him down the same route. We are told, in flashback, how Derek became involved with these people in the first place and what went on in prison to change his view. The trouble is, is it too late for young Danny? As you've probably already guessed, the Spoiler Police won't allow me to say any more.I have to say hats off to both Edward Norton as Derek and Edward Furlong as Danny. I have not seen either of them put in a better performance either before or since. Also worthy of note are; Beverly D'Angelo as their mother, Doris, Avery Brooks as the head teacher, Dr. Bob Sweeney, Jennifer Lien as their sister, Davina, Stacy Keach as the evil Cameron Alexander and it was also nice to see Elliott Gould as Murray, the English teacher.A large portion of the film is told in flashback and all of the flashback portions are in black and white, making it very easy for the audience to discern where the story is. I found this enhanced rather than distracted me from the narrative. There is much to admire in this film and I enjoyed it immensely. So, over all a really well made film with some great performances, a great score, a great script and some great cinematography Recommended.My Score: 8.7/10",9,0,1,12 June 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Most enjoyable film I've seen (so far) this year!
","I heard many good things about this movie before I went to see it. Even so, I didn't go in with too many expectations I wasn't disappointed. This was probably the most enjoyable movie I've seen so far this year. I walked out of the cinema with a smile on my face and there was even a spring in my step as I went over the preceding 112 minutes in my mind.Scott Pilgrim is a 22 year-old living in Toronto, Canada with his gay flatmate, Wallace Wells. Scott plays bass in a band called Sex Bob-Omb which consists of Scott (of course), Kim Pine on drums, Stephen Stills on lead vocals and guitar and Young Neil as hanger-on. The band has ambitions to be famous and so have a gig coming up at a Battle of the Bands show. At the start of the film he is dating a seventeen year old schoolgirl called Knives Chau. Things seem to be going along quite well until Scott has a vision of a girl called Ramona Flowers. He becomes besotted by her and they end up hanging out together and eventually dating. Unfortunately Scott soon learns that if he wants to date Ramona he must first defeat her seven evil exe's! Can Scott defeat these evil exe's and win Ramona? What will Knives think of his infidelity? All these questions and many more remain to be answered until you've seen the film of course.As I said at the beginning, this was probably the most enjoyable film I've watched so far this year. I found the quirky mix of live action with comic book elements quite refreshing and it gave the film an interesting look and feel that I liked a lot! Great performances all round, especially from Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, Kieran Culkin as Wallace Wells, Mark Webber as Stephen Stills, Alison Pill as Kim Pine and Ellen Wong as Knives Chau.This will most certainly feature in my best of the year awards in December. It did start to lose me a bit towards the end, but I won't hold that against it. A really well made film which deserves the praise it has got (IMO). Well worth the entrance fee and very highly recommended.My score: 8.3/10",8,8,23,28 August 2010
Tigerland," Training was never like this!...
","This is, again, a film I have seen before, and, again, I got a lot more out of it second time around. I have to blame my good buddy Mr. The Aus Man for pointing me in the direction of this one this week. Otherwise I may have watched one from 'The (now famous) List'. But I digress; I will give you my thoughts on this one after a brief summary (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please 'GIVE ME TEN SOLDIER!' while I write the next paragraph).It is 1971 and at the U.S. Army Training camp at Fort Polk, Louisiana, the new recruits are getting ready for their eight weeks' training. This will culminate in a visit to the infamous 'Tigerland', an area made to look and feel like Viet Nam. One soldier, Pvt. Roland Bozz, doesn't want to be there and he tries everything he can to get himself discharged, but the Army won't budge. He's a humanitarian who does not want to fight. He is befriended by Pvt. Jim Paxton, an aspiring writer. Bozz is very good at getting people out of the army who have a legitimate reason, and he gains a bit of a reputation for this. The brass doesn't know what to do with him, but he eventually shows leadership qualities and is made platoon Sergeant. This does not go down well with the psychopathic Pvt. Wilson, who takes it personally when Bozz has him removed from the platoon. Eventually they reach the stage where they have to go to Tigerland, and Bozz has a surprise waiting for him there. I've probably said too much, but I'll leave it there so as not to make the Spoiler Police too upset.At first I thought this film is trying so hard to be Kubrick's 1987 classic, Full Metal Jacket, but I was proved wrong. Although it's not quite as good as that, it's still pretty good. Good performances all round, particularly from; Colin Farrell as Bozz, Matthew Davis as Paxton, Clifton Collins Jr. as Miter, Tom Guiry as Cantwell and Shea Whigham as Wilson.As I said at the beginning, I have seen this film before, but I really couldn't remember much about it. On a second viewing, I can see I missed a pretty good film, maybe not brilliant, but certainly a good effort. The picture has kind of a news report feel about it, with slightly washed out colours and quite a bit of hand-held photography. Over all, a pretty enjoyable film that keeps the audience interested and has a few interesting plot twists Recommended.My score: 7.3/10",7,2,3,22 March 2011
Man on the Moon," Controversial... but I loved it!
","This is a film I have seen three times now and I must admit I love it! Apart from his portrayal of Ladka (hope I spelt that right) on the TV show 'Taxi', I knew very little about Andy Kaufman. Of course much of his work was focused on the US and so we didn't really hear much about it here in the UK. He was quite a character who had a very controversial career, some of it worked and was brilliant and some of it was a bit too wide of the mark for many. Either way, I found it a very interesting and entertaining film with a stand-out performance from Jim Carrey. I will tell you more after this brief summary.We begin with a very young Andy Kaufman putting on shows for his kid sister. Moving on, he's doing stand-up in a club when an agent, George Shapiro, sees him and offers to represent him. This leads to him landing the role of Ladka in 'Taxi', a role which, we are lead to believe, he didn't really want to do. Another character, Tony Clifton, puts in an appearance at this point. He is a cabaret singer and a very good friend of Andy's; in fact, Andy would only agree to play the part of Ladka if Tony could also appear in the show. Moving on, Andy and his writing partner, Bob Zmuda, turn their attention to wrestling and Andy begins to play the bad guy, wrestling women. One of the top wrestlers in the country, Jerry Lawler, doesn't like it and challenges Kaufman to a fight! It all comes to a head when they come to blows live on the David Letterman chat show. Little did people realise, but it was all staged and Kaufman and Lawler were really good friends. Andy eventually meets Lynne Marguiles who becomes his partner and they move in together. Sadly, it's not long after that he is diagnosed with cancer. Whilst fighting it he fulfils his lifetime ambition and puts on a show at Carnegie Hall in New York. I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police (Biopics Division) will be making my biopic a little shorter.A well made film with many people playing themselves which is either a testament to Andy KaufmanÂ… or they needed the work (that's a joke by the way). For me, the stand-out performance came from Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman; his best performance to date (IMO)! Danny DeVito did a great job as George Shapiro, as did Courtney Love as Lynne Marguiles and Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda. But, for me, a film that can bring together the likes of; Marilu Henner from 'Taxi', Judd Hirsch from 'Taxi', Carol Kane from 'Taxi', David Letterman and Christopher Lloyd from 'Taxi' has to have something special.I think the reason I like Jim Carrey in this so much is that it gives him the opportunity to play the crazy zany stuff he's famous for while at the same time giving him the chance to show the audience what a fine dramatic actor he is as well. The title comes from the REM song about Andy of the same name, refrains of which can be heard throughout the film, which I thought was a nice touch. As I said at the beginning this is the third time I've watched this film and it's the third time it's touched me emotionally. Not many films do that these days and so I have no problem in giving it a higher score than many and also deeming it 'highly recommended'.My score: 8.6/10.IMDb Score: 7.4/10 (based on 59,843 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 62/100 (based on 117 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 74/100 (based on 89,423 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",9,0,0,4 February 2012
Zulu," A great old fashioned epic war film Classic!...
","I have seen this film many times before; it was a particular favourite of mine as a youth. It's a story of immense bravery against seemingly insurmountable odds, and I guess that's what attracted me to it. Add to that, it's based on real events and you've got me sold! The British army has fought in many battles over the years and many medals have been won. The highest award for bravery is the Victoria Cross and no fewer than eleven were won by the defenders of a small outpost called Rorke's Drift in Natal, Africa on January 22, 1879.Having already won a great victory, slaughtering 1,200 British soldiers, Zulu warriors are on the march. Four thousand are headed for Rorke's Drift, a small missionary hospital in Natal. A detachment of troops from a Welsh regiment are stationed there under the command of Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead. An officer of the Royal Engineers, Lieutenant John Chard, is also in the vicinity when word comes of the defeat. Having seniority, Chard takes command and begins to make preparations for the coming attack. A missionary, Otto Witt and his daughter, Margareta are also there, but are proving more of a hindrance than a help. After the first Zulu attack the Witts' are sent away as Otto is distracting the men with his talk of death. Wave after wave of attacks ensue with great losses on both sides, but the garrison remains undefeated. Can they hold out? Will help come in time? Of course I can't tell you here or the Spoiler Police will have me clapped in irons and put on Company punishment again.Mostly filmed on location in Natal, you really get a feeling for the place. Of course the filmmakers couldn't get 4,000 extras to play the Zulu army, but they did a pretty good job with what they had Remember, no CGI back in 1964. This film is famous for being the first major film role for Michael Caine, who did a great job as the young aristocratic Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead. Equally good was Stanley Baker as Lieutenant John Chard R.E. Other performances of note came from; Jack Hawkins as Otto Witt, Ulla Jacobsson as Margareta Witt, James Booth as private Henry Hook and Nigel Green as Colour-Sergeant Bourne.The story is told entirely from the point of view of the garrison and this does make matters seem very one sided. Of course the battle scenes are all very well choreographed, but nothing like as brutal as they would be if it was made today. I loved this film when I was growing up and, believe it or not, I still love it today. It is most probably because of the story it tells, rather than it being an outstanding piece of filmmaking. I must admit, though, that Michael Caine does stand out in this one, his star potential is there for all to see. Over all, a film I have no problem recommending, even though it may not be politically correct to do so these days.My Score: 8.4/10.IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 13,839 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 92/100 (based on 13 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",Null,7,8,21 August 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Best of the summer blockbusters... So far...
","This must be some kind of record It's the third week in a row that my local cinema is showing something I want to see! It is a very rare thing, and something that should be savoured long may it continue. But I digress, we're here to talk about Apes. It is seldom these days that I find myself so totally engrossed in a film that time doesn't matter. This was one of those very rare occasions. I got so involved in the story that people going in and out of the theatre (as they do) didn't even bother me. I loved every minute of it and have no problem in recommending it to everyone. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.Will Rodman is a scientist who is working on a cure for Alzheimer's. He is very driven in his work because his father, Charles, suffers from the disease. It affects the brain and so Will's work revolves around a gene therapy that can re-connect pathways in the brain. They test it out on Chimpanzees and one of them, Bright Eyes, shows exceptional promise. Just as Will and his boss, Steven Jacobs, are asking for funding, Bright Eyes goes crazy and has to be shot. Jacobs orders all the apes put down, but they find that Bright Eyes had a baby. Will takes him home and discovers that the effects of the drug have been passed on. They call the baby Caesar and, with the help of a primate expert, Caroline Aranha, he eventually grows big and strong. Will gives the drug to his father and, at first, it works but then the effects wear off. He discovers what was wrong and develops a stronger version of the drug. After an incident with a neighbour, Caesar is ordered to be put in a sanctuary, away from the public. It is here that he comes into his own and it is here, under the mistreatment of his handlers, John and Dodge Landon that sparks the beginnings of The Rise of the Planet of the Apes. I can't say any more or the Spoiler Police will have me put in a cage next to Caesar.The CGI in this film is truly stunning, although you know most of it is computer generated, it doesn't detract from the enjoyment. As far as performances go, well, for me, the star was definitely Andy Serkis who did all the motion-capture work for Caesar, a really stunning performance. As far as the humans go, well, James Franco did a decent job as Will Rodman, as did Freida Pinto as Caroline Aranha, although I felt her character was never fully developed. John Lithgow was excellent as Charles Rodman and Brian Cox was suitably sleazy as John Landon. Tom Felton did a good job as the evil handler, Dodge Landon and David Oyelowo was Will's boss, Steven Jacobs.This is a film that will definitely be making my top ten come the end of the year. I loved every minute of it and I really hope any sequels that are made keep to the same standard. If I have one criticism, it's that the human characters are not particularly well developed. I can forgive that to a large extent because it forces the audience to see things from Caesar's perspective. This is certainly the best of the summer blockbusters so far this year and I can't see anything coming up that will top it (I'm prepared to be proved wrong though). Without a doubt, this one comes very highly RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.3/10.IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (16,160 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 83/100 (199 reviews counted when this review was written).",Null,0,2,14 August 2011
Cars," It's good... but not great...
","I have seen this film a couple of times now and, I have to admit, I didn't like it much at first, but after a second viewing, it's starting to grow on me a little. Made by Pixar, who have made some brilliant animated features, I expected something of a higher standard, but having said that, it's not all that bad. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please re-surface Main Street while I write the next paragraph).Lightning McQueen is a race car; he is an up-and-coming star and has qualified for a race-off in California for the Piston Cup. Loaded onto his transporter, Mack, he sets off for the long trip dreaming of victory. An accident leaves him lost in the desert and he finds himself in the little town of Radiator Springs. Sentenced to re-surface Main Street, which he inadvertently destroyed, McQueen is not happy and, at first, tries to escape. When this fails, he begins to accept his fate and, with the help of his new friends, Doc Hudson, Sally Carrera, Mater, and many others, he discovers that friends are more important than ambition. I won't tell you how it ends, but they are making a sequel.Technically, of course, I can't fault this one, the animation is spot-on. The story telling, well, it does get a bit baggy in the middle, but there is a rather good ending which I found, after a second viewing, partly makes up for it. The performances were OK too, but nothing particularly special. Honourable mentions go to; Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen, Paul Newman as Doc Hudson, Bonnie Hunt as Sally Carrera and not forgetting Larry The Cable Guy as Mater.I guess this is one of those 'almost, but not quite' movies that you'll come back to several times hoping it will be better. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but not quite up to the high standard I'd expect from Pixar. I guess they set the bar very high with the Toy Story trilogy. So, over all, although it's not as good as the other Pixar films (IMO), it's still perfectly watchable and so Recommended.My score: 7.1/10",7,1,2,26 December 2010
Bolt," Enjoyable, Engaging, Heart-warming, Funny, Exciting and Recommended.
","I wasn't sure I would like this one when I saw it on the TV schedule. I seem to remember it not doing all that well at the box-office when it was released. I shouldn't have worried; it has all the best bits that go into a Disney animation plus a heart-warming story to boot! But more of that later, here's a bit about the plot first.Bolt is a dog, not just an ordinary dog, he's a dog with superpowers! Penny, his human, and her father put him in a device that enabled him to run like the wind, be as stronger than a speeding truck, jump further than anyone, gave him laser vision and a super-bark that will destroy anything in its path. Each day, he saves Penny and they go back to the safety of his trailer, but one day she is taken by the evil Dr. Calico and Bolt is left alone in the trailer. Determined to find Penny he escapes into the real world, a world where his powers no longer work. He finds a cat, Mittens who, he believes, knows the whereabouts of Dr. Calico's lair. She eventually tells him it is in Hollywood, a long way from their current location, New York. And so, taking Mittens with him as insurance, Bolt begins a journey that will change his life. On the way they bump into his number-one fan, a hamster called Rhino. But that's all I'm going to say about the plot, don't want to give too much away now.A really well animated film, in the Pixar style as I like to call it. Some great gags and some really engaging characters combine to make this an enjoyable experience. Good performances all round, so honourable mentions go to; John Travolta as Bolt, Smiley Virus (ok, Miley Cyrus) as Penny, Susie Essman as Mittens, Mark Walton as Rhino and Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Calico.Over all a really enjoyable movie with some great characters and some really good sight gags and one-liners. I wasn't so sure about the music but then I'm not a big country music fan. It was also nice to see dog and a cat getting on together in a Disney film for a change! It does happen in real life you know! (ok, minor rant over). So, enjoyable, engaging, heart-warming, funny, exciting and recommended.My score: 7.7/10",8,2,3,30 August 2010
The Lives of Others," An emotional drama...
","I remember when this came out it got quite a lot of critical acclaim. Of course it never made it to a cinema near me and so when it came up in the TV listings it became a 'must see' for me. I'm really glad I saw it, it's somewhat different to what I was expecting (in a good way). I know there are a few out there that are afraid of subtitles, so I should tell you that yes, it's in German with subtitles. For me, this isn't a problem, but with a long film (as this is), I find I sometimes have to take a break to rest the brain for a few minutes. I found it to be a really engaging drama that has some truly powerful scenes and some great performances. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.It is East Germany in 1984, five years before the Berlin wall would fall. The East German people are constantly watched by the secret police, The Stasi. Anyone deemed to have strayed from the party line was arrested and interrogated. They could even end up in jail. When playwright, Georg Dreyman comes under the spotlight of the Stasi, at the behest of party official, Minister Bruno Hempf, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler is assigned the case. Dreyman's apartment is bugged and Wiesler begins to listen to the comings and goings in the flat. Dreyman lives with his girlfriend, actress, Christa-Maria Sieland, who has a big part to play in the events that unfold. As time goes by, Wiesler begins to empathise with those he's listening to. He realises that not everything has to be reported, to the extent that he even scales down the operation so he alone reports on the couple. He uses this position to protect them when Dreyman begins to do things the party really wouldn't like. I will leave my summary here so as not to be subjected to a 48 hour interrogation by them Spoiler Police.This is a very well made film, although I did find the surroundings very stark, but then again, I guess that's just realism. Great performances all round, particularly from Ulrich Mühe who played the rather serious Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler with great dignity. I thought Sebastian Koch as Georg Dreyman and Martina Gedeck as Christa-Maria Sieland were both superb. Ulrich Tukur did a good job as Wiesler's boss, Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz, as did Thomas Thieme as the loathsome Minister Bruno Hempf.I was surprised how much emotion was brought out both in, and by, this film. In the end it becomes a very heart-warming story. The beginning, on the other hand, I found really hard to follow, but once it settled down it was much easier. It has a slow, deliberate pace, but I didn't find it a chore to watch. I did find it was a little long though, but the extra scenes at the end are a real pay-off. So, if you're not scared of subtitles, and you can spare 137 minutes, then this one comes highly RECOMMENDED.My Score: 8.5/10.IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 93,806 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 93/100 (based on 150 reviews counted when this review was written).",9,3,3,14 August 2011
The Mist," Some of Stephen Kings scariest work
","First of all, I'll admit to being a fan of the work of Stephen King, like many others I have read, and enjoyed, a lot of his works. However, I had not read this particular story before watching this film. The setting is a small town in Maine where a powerful thunderstorm has just wreaked havoc and the townsfolk are just getting things back together.David Drayton, an artist who designs movie posters for a living, leaves his wife at home and heads to the local town store. He has his son, Billy with him, along with neighbour Brent Norton. As they set off they notice a mist coming down from the hills and across the lake. There are a lot of Army personnel on the road headed out of town; they are from the base situated in the hills. On arrival at the store they go about their shopping, David tries the payphone since he cannot get any service on his mobile but it's not working either. All of a sudden, as the mist envelops the store an old man with a bloody nose runs in and tells the people there not to go outside. There's something in the mist and it took his friend. One man makes a run for his car but we only hear his screams. They are now trapped in the store with, who knows what outside. Already people are divided, local 'crazy' woman, Mrs. Carmody begins quoting scripture and David's neighbour, Brent begins trying to get people to make a run for it. David gets some help from teacher, Amanda Dunfrey; she looks after Billy while he tries to figure a way out with a store clerk, and friend, Ollie Weeks. When a young man is killed by something unworldly as he's trying to go outside at the back of the store, people still will not believe it's dangerous out there. A group of them try to get out but fail to get very far. The divisions in the group get wider the longer it goes on and Mrs. Carmody's cries of holy retribution get more and more fanatical followers. I really don't want to say too much more for fear of giving too much away, but I will say that David, Billy, Amanda and a few others do make an attempt to get outside.It's a pretty well made film but some of the CGI wasn't top quality and did let it down slightly. It's quite a tense storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Decent performances from all of the main characters, Thomas Jane as David Drayton, Marcia Gay Harden was great as Mrs. Carmody, Laurie Holden as Amanda Dunfrey, Andre Braugher as Brent Norton and Toby Jones as Ollie Weeks.As with a lot of Stephen King stories, this is a very character driven piece and as such it works pretty well. The only thing I find with it is that the characters are sometimes portrayed as a little too much larger than life. For instance, Brent Norton is a lawyer and is adamant that there is nothing harmful outside. Even after the young man is killed he will not go into the back of the store to see the evidence. He's convinced the locals are trying to play a prank on him, even after some others go back there and tell him they're telling the truth. But I digress. Of course, because it's a horror film, the people have to do the most stupid things possible to put themselves in harms way. But I'll overlook all these cliché moments mainly because there is a really good ending. And no, I'm not going to give it away. Over all, it's a little cliché in places, but stick with it, the ending is pretty unexpected: recommended.My score: 7.4/10",7,1,4,1 April 2010
Kick-Ass," Original, Funny and Very, Very Violent...
","I saw this film when it first came out in the cinema and really enjoyed it. This week it came to our TV screens in a slightly cut version (about 4 minutes shorter than the theatrical release) but that didn't spoil my enjoyment of it. It was one of the best films I saw last year and the filmmakers will have to work hard to beat it again this year! If anything, I enjoyed it more second time around (if that's possible!). But enough of my prattling on, here's a short summary before I give you my thoughts (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please practice swearing with Hit Girl while I write the next paragraph).Dave Lizewski is an average teenage school kid, he says he has one superpower, he's invisible to girls. He and his friends, Marty and Todd, are into comic books and after hanging out one evening they are mugged by a couple of scumbags. It seems this is not the first time this has happened and Dave is getting a little fed-up with it. He goes online and gets himself a costume, a green wet-suit. After a bit of self-training, he decides he's ready and 'Kick-Ass' is born. He decides to confront the two muggers who held up him and his friends but things don't go well and he ends up having his ass kicked. After recovering in hospital and being screwed together with metal plates he finds his nerve endings are a bit damaged, which means he can take a bit more of a beating than before. Meanwhile, a real Superhero known as 'Big Daddy' is training his eleven year old daughter, 'Hit Girl'. They have a grudge against crime boss Frank D'Amico who framed 'Big Daddy' some years before. D'Amico's son, Chris is disillusioned with his father and decides to become a Superhero himself, called Red Mist in order to lure Kick-Ass out of hiding. They blame Kick-Ass for some losses they have been suffering recently. Kick-Ass eventually gains notoriety when he beats up three guys picking on another guy. The fight is filmed and put up on the internet, bringing a lot of media interest in Kick-Ass. Dave is also noticed by Katie Deauxma, although she doesn't know his secret identity, and thinks he's gay. I won't say too much more, but needless to say all of these various characters are destined to meet, and when they do I'll have to leave it there or I'll be having a knock at the door from the 'Spoiler Police' (& I don't want that).I must first say that it is a really well made film with some excellent stunt work. I thought the music chosen for the score was really great as well. Excellent performances from all of the leading cast, Aaron Johnson as Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, Nicolas Cage as Damon Macready/Big Daddy, Chloe Moretz as Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl, Mark Strong as Frank D'Amico, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris D'Amico/Red Mist and Lyndsy Fonseca as Katie Deauxma.There is a lot of humour in this film, both spoken and visual. It's also very very violent, so I wouldn't recommend it to those of a nervous disposition. I don't usually enjoy teen comedies, but this is very original, very different and it's very refreshing to see a film that pushes the boundaries somewhat. It's a film that any superhero film fan should try to watch at least once a year and I recommend it very highly! My score: 9.2/10",9,4,15,3 April 2010
The Man Who Would Be King," A classic adventure movie!... Great stuff from Connery and Caine
","Based on a story by Rudyard Kipling, this is one of those films that I've always wanted to see but never managed to, until today. The gods of time were always against me with this one I'd always turn over when it was half way through, or there would be something else I wanted to see on the other side, but I finally bagged & tagged it today! A film of great scope with a lot of action and adventure, it keeps you guessing until the end. I enjoyed it, with a few reservations, but more of that after this brief summary.Late one night, a shadowy figure visits reporter, Rudyard Kipling, in his office in India. The visitor is Peachy Carnehan, and he is there to tell Kipling a tale. He reminds Kipling that they had previously met three years ago when he had witnessed a contract between Peachy and his colleague, and friend, Daniel Dravot. The two men, latter-day confidence tricksters, had recently left the army in India and had decided to go and seek their fortune in the little-known land of Kafiristan. The contract stated that they would abstain from alcohol and women for the duration of their adventure amongst other things. They set off and after a torturous journey they finally arrive. Having scared off some natives with their rifles, they are surprised to find a Ghurkha living in one of the villages. He was the only survivor of a geological expedition several years earlier. This man, known as 'Billy Fish' would act as interpreter for the pair. And so they begin their rise to power by persuading the leader of the village to let them train their men so they can defeat all his enemies. Things continue in a similar vein until Daniel is hit with an arrow that doesn't kill him in a battle. Word of this gets back to the holy city of the region and the pair is summoned. I won't say any more because what happens next is key to the whole plot & I don't want the Spoiler Police raising an army and chasing me down.Very well made a beautifully shot, but you wouldn't expect anything less from the likes of John Huston. Great performances all round, particularly from Sean Connery as Daniel Dravot and Michael Caine as Peachy Carnehan, they seemed to spark off each other really well. It's a shame they haven't made more films together on this evidence. Also worthy of note were Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling and Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish.There is some great dialogue in this film and it is delivered with great aplomb by both leading actors. They are supposed to be common men; non-commissioned officers of her majesty's army, and that's just what they speak like. Very much an old-fashioned adventure film, it really delivers on that front. I mentioned there was a problem with it though, and it's that it's just too damn long, you could easily lose thirty minutes of the running time from the beginning and the film would be just as good, if not better (in my book). If it wasn't for this I would have definitely scored it higher, but even so, it still a great film and comes with my seal of approval Recommended.My Score: 7.8/10.IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 20,799 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 96/100 (based on 23 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",8,0,2,15 October 2011
Gran Torino," Eastwood's finest to date!
","This is reported to be Clint Eastwood's last starring role. If this is true then he has most definitely left us on a high. He plays the part of Korean War veteran, Walt Kowalski quite flawlessly; in fact I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. Walt lives in Highland Park, Michigan, a neighbourhood that is dominated by immigrants, particularly the Hmong (pronounced 'mong').Having lost his wife and being distanced from his two sons, Walt lives alone with his Labrador retriever Daisy. He is very patriotic and finds it hard to come to terms with all the immigrants living around him. The boy who lives next door, Thao, is being pestered by his cousin, Spider to join his Hmong gang after they saved him from some Hispanics. Thao reluctantly agrees and his initiation is to steal Walt's prized car, his 1972 Gran Torino. He is discovered during the attempt, but gets away. A few days later the gang return and try to take Thao by force, but his sister, Sue tries to stop them and a fight breaks out. The fight spills onto Walt's property and he's suddenly there pointing a rifle at one of the gang members. They leave, but warn Walt to watch his back. Thao's family are traditional and they take him round to Walts house and tell him that Thao must work for him to make amends. Walt reluctantly takes him on and they eventually become friends as he gets Thao to mend the other houses in the street. You know that the gang are not far off, and sure enough they appear again and this time it's much more serious. It's now up to Walt to put things right. I won't say any more, I think that's enough spoilers for one day.A brilliantly measured performance from Clint Eastwood, he gave us the full range of his craft in this film. Everything from the brooding loner from the spaghetti westerns to the comic cowboy of Bronco Billy. So hats off to Clint Eastwood as Walt Kowalski for a most memorable performance. Also strong performances from Christopher Carley as Father Janovich, Bee Vang as Thao Vang Lor and Ahney Her as Sue Lor.A very well made film, again in the measured style that we've come to expect from Clint Eastwood (as director). A well thought out plot that kept me interested throughout and some really good performances. Over all, a very entertaining film telling a heart-warming story. Probably one of the best films I'll see this year and one I can highly recommend!My score: 8.8/10",9,1,4,7 March 2010
The Hurt Locker," A really compelling film...
","This film won 6 Oscars, including Best Director for Kathryn Bigelow and Best Film. It has also picked up a further 72 Awards around the world and had 46 nominations. Given that kind of attention, there must be something really good about it, either that, or everything else was really bad. I decided it must be the first option, so I decided to get the DVD and give it a spin. I wasn't disappointed; it's a really good, well made film about the Iraq war. But more of my thoughts later, here's a short summary.The leader of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit with the U.S. Army's Bravo Company, Staff Sergeant Thompson is killed in the line of duty. With just over a month of their tour to go, the Sergeant is replaced by Sergeant First Class William James. The rest of the team, Sergeant JT Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge are not put at ease by their new CO's cavalier attitude to his work. It seems that James, although a very talented explosives expert, is also addicted to the danger. This puts his team on edge and arguments inevitably ensue. Things calm down when they come across a group of men from British private military company in the desert. They have just captured two wanted Iraqis but their vehicle has broken down. Just as the EOD team offer to help they come under fire from insurgents. Three of the British team are killed before the EOD team get it together and manage to neutralise the threat. This brings them closer and back at base they celebrate before the reality of the war hits them again the next day. I won't say any more, don't want to give too much away.I found it a really compelling film to watch. Some great cinematography, the explosions, in particular, looked really impressive. Some great performances too, in particular, Jeremy Renner as Staff Sergeant William James, Anthony Mackie as Sergeant JT Sanborn and Brian Geraghty as Specialist Owen Eldridge. Honourable mentions go to the supporting cast, including, Guy Pearce as Sergeant Matt Thompson, Ralph Fiennes as Contractor Team Leader, David Morse as Colonel Reed and Evangeline Lilly as Connie James.I'm quite surprised this film didn't do as well at the box office as its critical acclaim might suggest, however I do remember it coming to a local multiplex and only being on show for a week. But over all I really enjoyed this film, it kept you guessing where it was going next but also allowed you to engage with the characters. The, kind of, documentary style put you right in the centre of the action which made it a more exciting experience. Definitely one of the films of 2009 and I recommend it very highly.My score: 8.7/10",9,3,9,30 March 2010
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," A little too long but still very Ghibli!... Worth a look?
","The last in my current series of Studio Ghibli films; you can have a little too much Ghibli if you're not careful! Fear not, I shall be returning to films from this studio sometime in the New Year so stay posted. This is an interesting one; I found the concept most intriguing but the execution (I'm sad to say) left a little to be desired (IMO). Technically and imaginatively, it's up there with the best of them, I just found it didn't quite have the punch I was expecting. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary.A thousand years after the world was laid waste small kingdoms exist on the margins of a polluted planet. One of these is The Valley of the Wind where a princess, Nausicaä, flies over the toxic forests in her glider. Giant insects inhabit the forest and she is respectful of them. She finds she is called upon when her valley is invaded by those who would unleash the monsters that had initially destroyed the world. Can she calm the beasts in the Toxic Forest before they destroy what is left of humanity? As you can probably guess, the Spoiler Police would not be pleased if I told you here In fact, I fear they would send me back to the Toxic Forest (again).Beautifully animated throughout and with great imagination, I can't fault the way this film looks or the imagination of Hayao Miyazaki. To come up with a world like this must have taken a great deal of time and effort. I saw the Japanese version (with subtitles) although I have heard of a dubbed (and severely 'kiddiefied') version – beware this one.I guess the problem I had with this film was that, although it's brilliantly conceived and made, it failed to have any emotional impact on me and it lacked the punch I have come to expect from Miyazaki's work. I guess the characters didn't have enough depth for me to really care about them enough. Add to that the fact that I found it way too long and I guess it's failing on two counts! Having said that, I think it's still worth a viewing You never know, you may love it a tad more than I did!...

Garden State," Interesting stuff from Zach Braff...
","I really did not no much about this film before seeing it, well, I probably did know that Zach Braff (of TV's 'Scrubs' fame) both wrote and directed it. I watched it on a recommendation from someone on Rotten Tomatoes, sorry, I can't remember who, but rest assured, it's another one crossed off 'The List'. I found it very interesting, a little surreal in places, quite enjoyable, but in the end, not as fulfilling as I had expected. I'll explain more after this brief summary.Andrew Largeman, a failed actor has had to return to the small town he grew up after the sudden death of his mother. He has anxiety problems and usually takes quite a lot of medication, but he has left all that behind in L.A. He runs into quite a few of his old friends from school, primarily Mark, Dave and Kenny, and they all hang out together, go to parties and the like. During a visit to a doctor, Andrew meets Sam and they immediately hit it off. He gives her a lift home and they end up spending the next few days together. This seems to bring Andrew back to life, but it's nearing the time he has to leave I'll stop there or the Spoiler Police will have me bang to rights! And I don't want that.I must first say the film has a cracking soundtrack, there are some great tunes throughout. All the performances were very good; Zach Braff as Andrew Largeman, Natalie Portman, who I thought was excellent, as Sam, Peter Sarsgaard as Mark, Alex Burns as Dave, Michael Weston as Kenny, Ian Holm as Andrew's father, Gideon Largeman. Finally a mention for a brief appearance from Jim Parsons ('The Big Bang Theory') as Tim.The film has a very muted feel to it which was fine at first, it allowed for small pieces of comic genius to flower, but after a while I began to find it a little depressing. Braff plays Largeman so downbeat from the beginning that by the end when you're supposed to be uplifted, you're still down somewhere near the floor. Don't get me wrong, there are many things to admire about this film and I did enjoy several aspects of it. I think I'll have to see it again sometime to appreciate it properly but for now Recommended (but only just).My Score: 6.6/10.IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 104,531 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 86/100 (based on 185 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",Null,0,0,13 September 2011
Event Horizon," Sadly underrated (IMO)...
","I remember being impressed with this film when I first saw it way back in the late 1990's. It's one of those that, once you've seen it, it keeps coming back to you. I have been meaning to watch it again for some time now and so I though now being as good time as any I popped it in the DVD player, turned the sound up and let her rip! I wasn't disappointed; it's every bit as good as I remember, right down to the pumping 'Prodigy' track that runs over the closing credits. I will give you my take on it after this very brief summary.The experimental spaceship, The Event Horizon, has been missing for seven years after it left the solar system bound for Proxima Centuri. After its beacon is detected in the vicinity of Neptune, a rescue mission is launched. A specialist crew is sent out along with Dr. William Weir, the man who designed the ship. The crew consists of; Captain Miller, Peters, the Med Tech, Lt. Starck, Cooper, Justin, D.J. and Smith. Dr. Weir is haunted with memories of his dead wife, who had recently committed suicide. None of them are prepared for what they find when they reach the, now deserted, Event Horizon. The experimental drive had taken it to places beyond understanding and it hadn't come back alone. I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be signing me up for another trip.A very well made film with some really excellent effects. Great performances all round; everyone did a very professional job and made the story believable. So, special praise goes to; Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller, Sam Neill as Dr. William Weir, Kathleen Quinlan as Peters and Joely Richardson as Lt. Starck. Honourable mentions go to; Richard T. Jones as Cooper, Jack Noseworthy as Justin, Jason Isaacs (hello to him) as D.J. and Sean Pertwee as Smith.I must admit I really like this film, how it's got such a low rating on Rotten Tomatoes I will never know! Yes, the plot is a little complicated but I did find it truly scary and there a very few films I can say that about these days. To me I think it's probably the best space horror since the Alien films and it's certainly better than Alien 4! I haven't read what the professional critics have to say on it, but I will stick to my guns and say it's a very underrated Sci-Fi Horror that deserves better recognition Recommended.My Score: 7.7/10.IMDb Score: 6.4/10 (based on 54,832 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 23/100 (based on 35 reviews (No Consensus) counted at the time of going to press).",8,3,6,18 November 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Riveting thriller from the pen of Stieg Larsson with a truly memorable performance from Noomi Rapace
","Based of the first novel of the 'Millennium Trilogy' by Stieg Larsson, this Swedish film adaptation is (IMO) quite excellent. I should make it clear that I watched the extended edition which runs for just short of three hours. Also, being a bit of a purist, I watched it with subtitles, although there is the option of a dubbed version for those not quite so brave. I was quite surprised just how enthralling it was and, having never read the novels, just what a well written drama it turned out to be. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary.Mikael Blomkvist is the editor of a magazine, 'Millennium', that has accused businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström of some wrongdoing. The case went to court and Blomkvist lost. He has just three months before he has to go to jail for six months. Unbeknownst to him, he has been investigated himself by a professional hacker, Lisbeth Salander, who works for a security firm. The reason becomes clear when Blomkvist is hired by wealthy businessman, Henrik Vanger, to investigate the disappearance of his niece more than forty years ago. Moving out to the remote island where the Vanger family all live, in separate houses, Blomkvist is soon embroiled in the case. Little does he know though, but Lisbeth Salander is still keeping tabs on him and when she sends him the answer to a vital clue the unlikely pair end up joining forces in order to solve the case. There is an awful lot more to tell but I dare not say it or the Spoiler Police might find a way to make me disappear.A very well made film with an almost washed-out look to the visuals which always makes me think of northern climes. I also thought the music by Jacob Groth was excellent and fitting the, at times, haunting piece very well. As for performances, well, both Michael Nyqvist as Mikael Blomkvist and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander were outstanding particularly Noomi Rapace. Also worthy of note were; Lena Endre as Erika Berger, Sven-Bertil Taube as Henrik Vanger, Peter Haber as Martin Vanger, Peter Andersson as Nils Bjurman, Marika Lagercrantz as Cecilia Vanger, Ingvar Hirdwall as Dirch Frode and Björn Granath as Gustav Morell.On the DVD the film is split into two parts, each of about ninety minutes. This, I found, made it feel a little bit like a TV adaptation rather than a cinema release. Don't get me wrong, all the production values of a big cinema release are there, but I did, at times, feel like I was watching a major two-parter on HBO (or Sky Atlantic for us Brits), albeit in Swedish. Despite this, I still very much enjoyed this mystery thriller and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the other two parts of the set. Maybe I'll have to watch a couple of things in English in between too much Swedish at once can really get taxing. Over all though, totally engrossing with some truly excellent performances Highly recommended.My Score: 8.2/10 IMDb Score: 7.7/10 (based on 48,699 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 86/100 (based on 165 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",8,1,2,18 October 2011
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Compelling and very poignant
","Having heard quite a few good things about this film I was quite keen to see what all the fuss was about. I wasn't disappointed, it's a very though provoking and, at times (for me at least), a very emotional experience. The setting is Germany during World War Two where a family live in Berlin.Eight year old Bruno is quite happy living in Berlin, he has many friends to play with, a sister, Gretel, a loving mother and his father is a soldier. When father gets a promotion, however, things are about to change dramatically for the boy. They move to a big house in the countryside where Bruno is initially not happy. He spots what looks like a farm from his bedroom window. All the people working there seem to be wearing striped pyjamas. He asks his mother about it and at first she seems OK with him making new friends, but once she learns the nature of her husband's new job she changes her mind. Eventually Bruno becomes bored and goes off to explore. He finds his way through the woods until he comes across a high fence behind which is a boy of his own age called Shmuel. Returning often, Bruno soon becomes friends with this strange boy. But all is not what it seems, and things are about to take a very drastic turn for two friends.Even though it has quite a slow pace I found this film quite absorbing. The music, under the direction of music editor Dick Bernstein, is excellent and fits the mood quite perfectly. Great performances from both Asa Butterfield as Bruno and Jack Scanlon as Shmuel. Also very creditable performances from Vera Farmiga as Elsa (Mother), David Thewlis as Father, Rupert Friend as Lieutenant Kotler and David Hayman as Pavel.I found it quite a difficult film to watch, but given the subject matter it was never going to be an easy watch. Having said that, the film did portray the innocence of youth very well which is all credit to all involved. The ending is quite dramatic and not for the feint hearted. So, over all, this can be a difficult film to watch, but ultimately it is worth the effort. Recommended.My score: 8.4/10",8,1,1,16 August 2010
Ip Man," Inspiring stuff...
","This martial arts film tells the story of the life of Ip Man, the Chinese martial arts master who was an inspiration to, amongst others, Bruce Lee. A beautifully made film with some really excellent martial arts on show. The film concentrates on the years up to and including the Japanese occupation of China in the late 1930's.Ip Man is a master of the art of Wing Chun, a form of Kung Fu that was not generally accepted at the time. He practiced constantly and occasionally had duels with other masters. His wife disapproved of this and thinks he should spend more time with his son. He was quite well off and did not find it necessary to work for a living, but he is well respected for his talent amongst the townsfolk. When the Japanese invade they are thrown out of their comfortable home and forced to live in poverty. Having sold most of their possessions, Ip Man decides he must find a job. He works at a yard tipping coal and many of his friends find themselves there too. A Japanese General, Miura, is a fan of martial arts and wants to see if any of the Chinese masters can beat his Japanese trained fighters. Some volunteer to fight, including a friend of Ip Man. When his friend doesn't come back, Ip Man volunteers the next time. He defeats ten opponents and the General is impressed and he challenges Ip Man to a duel. Will he accept? Well, I'll leave you hanging there so as not to give away too much.I love the way this film is shot, beautifully colourful at the beginning and then very muted and grey once the Japanese arrive in the scene. Great performances all round, particularly from Donnie Yen as Ip Man and Simon Yam as Zhou Qing Quan. Although it's quite hard to judge a performance in a foreign language.The fighting scenes are all spectacular. Beautifully choreographed and expertly performed. I did find the plot a little contrived, but quite easy to follow and I even found a few glimmers of humour here and there. Over all, a pretty good watch that's great to look at with some excellent fight scenes, oh, and the music isn't too bad either Recommended.My Score: 7.5/10",8,0,0,9 July 2011
Clash of the Titans," Nice visuals but not a great film...
","As this film was released in 3D I had no interest in seeing it when it was released, I'm not a fan of paying extra for something that adds very little to the film and usually gives me a headache. Although, I believe, it made a bit of money, it was not critically well received. Well, I don't always agree with them, but on this occasion I'm here to tell you I have to agree with the critics. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those who don't wish to know anything about the plot please fend off those giant scorpions while I write the next paragraph).The gods live on mount Olympus and feed off the worship of the humans below. Unfortunately the humans are getting restless and don't feel the love any more. The leader of the gods, Zeus, isn't too happy about this and when his brother, Hades comes to him with a plan, he listens. Hades wants to teach the humans a lesson by releasing the Kraken, a giant sea monster, on them. Meanwhile back with the humans, a young man, a son of Zeus called Perseus is chosen to find a way to defeat the Kraken. A band of men go with him and one woman, Io, who proves to be of great help to Perseus. They must first find three witches who hold the secret to destroying the Kraken I think you get the drift. There's also the story of how the gods are trying to stab each other in the back going on, but I think there's enough there to give you the gist.This is a very well made film, you can tell they had a pretty large budget to make this one. There is quite a lot of CGI and it is all of high quality. The trouble is, it did tend to detract from the story by making the visuals more important and not progressing the story in places. Decent performances all round; Sam Worthington was good as Perseus, although I felt he was a little too subdued for the role. Liam Neeson donned the sparkly armour and did a good job as Zeus, Ralph Fiennes was the best of the bunch (IMO) as Hades, you got two for the price of one with Jason Flemyng as Calibos/Acrisius and Gemma Arterton did a decent job as Io.I felt the plot was a little over complicated, there were lots of sub-plots going on and I could feel it getting a little confusing at times. Although the visuals were great, again, they didn't really add a great deal (for me). Over all, although it's not going to win any prises, it's entertaining enough, a good one for a wet Sunday afternoon on the TV but I wouldn't pay to see it in the cinema.My score: 5.2/10",5,1,2,20 February 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," An interesting adaptation of the Philip K. Dick short story...
","Based on a short story called 'The Adjustment Team' by Philip K. Dick, the ideas behind this film intrigued me from the moment I first heard about it. Imagine a world where your fates are determined for you and if you stray from your prescribed path, an adjustment is made to put you back on it. The 'people' responsible for making the adjustments are, of course, 'The Adjustment Bureau'. Now you know that, I can write a brief summary (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please try on some stylish hats while I write the next paragraph).David Norris is a young ambitious politician; he is running for the Senate, representing New York, when his campaign is de-railed by a scandal from his past. Resigned to defeat, he retires to the men's washroom to practice his speech. There he meets dancer Elise Sellas who he instantly falls in love with. She gives him the confidence to give a brilliant speech that galvanises the public enough to call for him to stand for election at a later date but that's in the future. He is so enamoured with Elise that, when he meets her again the very next day, he asks for her number, which she gives him. Now, the path that has been prescribed for David Norris does not include a relationship with Elise Sellas. In steps the Adjustment Bureau in the guise of a group of agents led by a character known as Richardson. They do all they can to keep the couple apart and even reveal themselves to David in an effort to make him see sense. Unfortunately for them, he is determined to be with her and eventually the case is sent up to the next level and Thompson takes charge. He gives David a choice, either continue on this path and ruin both of their lives, or take the path prescribed for him. It's a tough decision, but David has an ally in Harry Mitchell, who has been following him for a long time. And it's here I'll leave my summary don't want to give too much away.This is a very well made film with some great special effects, but it is the story that drives the action and not the other way around. It is very much a love story, but a love story with a rather cunning twist and one that I very much enjoyed. All of the leading cast are excellent; Matt Damon as David Norris, Emily Blunt as Elise Sellas, John Slattery as Richardson, Michael Kelly as Charlie Traynor, Anthony Mackie as Harry Mitchell and Terence Stamp as Thompson.I love the premise of this film and, although I enjoyed it very much, I felt there was a little too much focus on the love story and not enough on the bureau. Maybe it's just me, but I never really felt there was enough chemistry between the two lovers to warrant the effort put in by the David Norris character. In the end though, it's a perfectly watchable entertaining film, without being particularly mind-bending or spectacular. Better than average and recommended.My score: 7.2/10",7,2,4,5 March 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Quirky and quite bizarre in places, but also quite unique...
","This is a film I saw several years ago and immediately fell in love with. I thought it would be interesting to give it another viewing just to see how well it's stood up in the intervening years. Well I'm pleased to report, it does pretty well; if anything, I like it slightly more after this most recent viewing. I will tell you more after this brief summary.We begin with a couple meeting on a train for the first time. They are Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. Everything seems to be going very well and then the mood suddenly changes. Joel is in his car banging his head against the steering wheel; very upset, almost inconsolable. He eventually finds out that Clementine has undergone a procedure to erase him from her memory. Unable to live with that, he decides to do the same. It is through this process that we see their entire relationship from the end to the beginning. Will it be successful, or is Joel doomed to live with his grief? Well obviously I can't tell you that or the Spoiler Police will be erasing my memory (some say they already have!).Beautifully made with some outstanding (& very subtle) CGI; I really love the way small things are erased as a scene progresses, or they go out of focus so you get the impression of memories being lost. The performances are all excellent too; especially Jim Carrey as Joel Barish (I really wish he would take more parts like this, he's very good at it) and Kate Winslet who played Clementine Kruczynski perfectly; in fact she got an Oscar for it! Honourable mentions go to; Elijah Wood as Patrick, Mark Ruffalo as Stan, Kirsten Dunst as Mary and Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Mierzwiak.There are several sub-plots that I have not included in the main summary that serve to show the imperfections in the process Joel and Clementine have undergone. This takes the film to a higher lever for me, it illustrates that no matter what, there may be a person you are supposed to be with. I don't know whether that's true or not, but it's a concept that (I know) many cling to. But back to the film It's really well made with some excellent performances; very well written (another Oscar for that), one that's quirky and quite bizarre in places, but also one that's quite unique and one I have no problem in deeming 'Highly Recommended'.My score: 9.1/10.IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 297,486 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 93/100 (based on 218 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 93/100 (based on 503,889 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",9,0,1,31 January 2012
Alice in Wonderland," Good, but sadly unsatisfying...
","I have never seen the 1951 Disney animated feature which tells the story of Alice's first trip to Wonderland. You see, she has grown up now and this film tells the story of her second set of adventures in Wonderland. I'll give you a brief summary before I tell you my thoughts (summary haters please tell me why A Raven is like a Writing Desk It's been bothering me all day).Alice is now nineteen and it has been arranged that she shall marry Hamish, the son of a Lord, but she is not really interested in marriage. It is decided that he will propose to her publicly at a party thrown by his family. The unpretentious Alice is distracted as the big moment arrives and finds herself compelled to follow a white rabbit just as he comes out with the words. As you might guess, the rabbit disappears down a hole and is soon followed by Alice. Having made herself the right size by drinking a potion, she enters Wonderland, a place that looks kind of familiar, but she can't place from where. Here she meets many characters, including the Mad Hatter, The Cheshire Cat and the Red Queen. At first there is some debate as to whether she is the right Alice, and she has reservations herself. You see, if she is the right Alice, then she must perform a very heroic task and she's not sure she's up to doing that. I really don't want to give it away, so I'll leave Alice down the rabbit hole for now.This is unmistakably a Tim Burton film. All the quirks and outlandishness that mark his style of filmmaking in abundance. It is beautifully made with great attention to detail. I saw the 2D version which, I'm told by those who know about these things, is better than the 3D cut. Great performances all round, particularly from; Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter, Mia Wasikowska as Alice, Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. I should also give honourable mentions to Crispin Glover as Stayne - Knave of Hearts, Matt Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and the voice talents of; Michael Sheen as the White Rabbit, Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, Alan Rickman as the Blue Caterpillar, Barbara Windsor as the Dormouse, Paul Whitehouse as the March Hare and Timothy Spall as Bayard.Although this film is beautifully made with some great performances, I found it ultimately unsatisfying. I think because I know the story quite well the awe and wonder of seeing it for the first time is lost and that detracts from the viewer's enjoyment. There are some great comic moments and some truly magical scenes, but as a whole it kind of lacked something for me. It's worth seeing, but I wouldn't rush to buy the DVD even so, recommended.My score: 6.4/10",6,0,1,1 January 2011
The Artist," A breath of fresh air!...Well worth a look...
","Very well made with a beautiful musical score by Ludovic Bource, it really set the tone and held the film together brilliantly. I found this film a breath of fresh air; it took me back to Saturday morning TV when they used to show the odd silent movie. A simple love story with some great acting and a brilliant musical score really hit the mark (for me). I did find, though, that George's decline went on a little too long, just when you thought he'd hit bottom there was a little further to go. But that's the only criticism I have, it's beautifully made in the style of the time and, although it may not be for everyone, it's still one I have no problem in deeming Recommended.My score: 8.6/10.IMDb Score: 8.4/10 (based on 28,029 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 97/100 (based on 191 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 91/100 (based on 24,406 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,1,4,19 February 2012
Invictus," Inspirational stuff from Clint Eastwood...
","I guess I should state at the start that I am a huge fan of Rugby Union, the game featured in this film. A little sceptical when I first put the disc in the DVD player because I'm not a fan of South Africa, I'm English, but my worst fears were soon put aside. The film focuses on Nelson Mandela's efforts to unite his country, and how he used rugby as part of this process. Based on true events, much of the story is about a country divided along lines if race that is now emerging into a new era. To help ease this process, and to get many of the whites on his side, Nelson Mandela inspires the captain of the Springboks, the South African rugby team, François Pienaar, and encourages him in his quest to win the World Cup, which is being hosted there.Technically, this is a very well made film, although, as is usual with sports in films, the close-up action shots do appear to be staged (which, of course, they are). This failing aside, it's a very well written script and there are some very nice performances. There is a nice little sub-plot involving Mandela's security people, who are all black at the beginning, but when they ask for more men, Mandela sends some white security people round. After a little uncertainty at first, we see them gradually earn each other's trust as the film progresses. A neat little device that illustrates the points being made in the main part of the movie.Unusually for a film of this type, the two main characters, who are both very inspirational men, seldom meet. When they do, you can feel the strength of Mandela giving encouragement to Pienaar. This comes across very well and even I was rooting for the Springboks by the end of the film (and I already knew who won!). I remember well watching the final, where Mandela pulled off a great stroke by wearing a Springboks shirt. This had been a symbol of power to the whites and a symbol of oppression to the blacks in South Africa. This one simple act did much to unite the nation and greatly inspire the team.Two great performances; Morgan Freeman really nailed the voice and the mannerisms of Nelson Mandela, of course, he doesn't really look much like him, but I guess you can't have everything. Matt Damon did a great job as François Pienaar, inspirational speeches and a lot of physical work also, but, again, he doesn't really look like the man he's portraying. I can forgive that as they both did a really good job.Over all I found this a very inspirational film with some great moments. It features two very good performances, but I did find it a little too long and the close-up action looked a little too staged. Having said that, I would watch it again sometime and I'm sure I would find more things to like about it. I do like the very measured style Clint Eastwood uses in the films he directs, nothing is too overstated and I have to admire him for that. Recommended.My Score: 7.5/10",8,0,1,25 April 2011
Super 8," Good... without being great...
","I know this one came out in a lot some territories quite a while ago, but (for some reason) it has only just appeared here on UK screens. As a consequence I have read many reviews praising it, with a few dissenters too. This intrigued me and, when it finally arrived, I decided to go and see it. They were showing it in the little screen upstairs at my local cinema and I had a little trepidation when some teenage girls came in and started complaining about the size of the screen. I shouldn't have worried; once the film started they settled down. Many likable characters came across the screen and I could see just what J.J. Abrams was aiming at More of my thoughts later after this brief summary.A group of kids are making a film; it being the time before video tape, they have to film it on a Super 8 cine camera. The group's leader, Charles, wants to make a zombie movie for an upcoming competition. He is helped by Joe Lamb, Cary, Martin, Preston, and latterly Alice Dainard. Joe has recently lost his mother in an accident and his dad, a deputy sheriff, is struggling to adapt. He has a thing for Alice, whose dad had worked with Joe's mother and blames himself for the accident. But I digress whilst filming one night by the railway tracks; they witness an accident that derails a military train. They capture on film something escaping from one of the carriages, but, of course, they don't know about that until they can get the film developed (3 days later). By that time the town has gone crazy; disappearances of equipment and people even all the dogs have left! The military come in to clear up the train wreck and end up evacuating the town. Can these young filmmakers get to the bottom of what's going on? Well, just in case there is someone out there that hasn't seen it, I'd better not say. Them spoiler police will be hanging me up to dry.A very well made film with likable characters, some neat CGI and some very clever effects. I cannot fault the performances, the young cast all did a great job, in particular; Joel Courtney as Joe Lamb, Elle Fanning as Alice Dainard and Riley Griffiths as Charles. All three stood out (for me) and I'm sure they'll all go far. Also worthy of a mention were; Kyle Chandler as Jackson Lamb (Joe's dad), Ryan Lee as Cary, Gabriel Basso as Martin and Zach Mills as Preston.As I've already said, I can see what J.J. Abrams was aiming at, and that is the Spielberg films of the late 70's to the early 80's. Films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and even the Spielberg-produced, The Goonies (1985). Unfortunately this doesn't have the warmth or the magic of those films, but it is still a worthy effort. There seems to be quite a long time where not much happens and this disrupts the pacing towards the middle. But even so, by the end I really quite enjoyed it. Some great music, both the original soundtrack by Michael Giacchino and the songs of the period that were chosen. As far as the cinematography goes, I've read a lot of comment about 'flaring'; this didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I like that they show the film the kids were making while the end credits are rolling It's pretty neat.

Reservoir Dogs," I didn't rate it first time around How does it fair 20 years on?...
","Lauded by many, despised by a few, it's been a long time since I saw 'Reservoir Dogs' and I have to come clean I didn't really rate it first time around. So I thought it was time I gave it another shot since it aired on TV (again) recently. How did it fair this time around? Well I'll tell you after this brief summary.A jewellery heist has gone wrong and the perpetrators make their way back to a pre-arranged rendezvous, a warehouse. The cops knew about the robbery and they have a traitor in their midst. To keep themselves anonymous, Joe, the organiser of the heist had given them all names of colours. Mr Brown and Mr Blue were both killed during the heist and Mr Orange is injured. He and Mr White are the first to arrive, soon followed by Mr Pink. Later Mr Blonde turns up with a surprise in the trunk of his car a cop. They start beating up on the cop trying to find out if he knows who betrayed them, but he knows nothing. Nice Guy Eddie, Joe's son, turns up next and tells them to move the cars; leaving the psychotic Mr Blonde with the injured Mr Orange and the cop. At this point I'll leave it or the Spoiler Police (Tarantino Division) will have me making films with scenes stolen from just about every film I've ever seen (again).I must admit I do like the rough style with which this film is made, there seems to be a lot of ad-libbing from the actors and, for the most part, it works pretty well. There are flashbacks telling us how some of the major players got involved in the job and these (to me) are more interesting than some of the stuff going on in the warehouse. As far as performances go, well Harvey Keitel as Mr. White - Larry Dimmick, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange - Freddy Newandyke, Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde - Vic Vega and Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink all did an excellent job. Honourable mentions also go to; Chris Penn as Nice Guy Eddie Cabot and Lawrence Tierney as Joe Cabot.As with many of Tarantino's works there is an awful lot of dialogue (just see my 'Favourite Quotes' section below for a taster). This, I find can be both confusing and distracting if not properly choreographed with what the audience is watching. Two talking heads in a room can get pretty uninteresting after a while and this is what you get in some scenes. There is no incidental music, the only music we here is from the radio that always plays hits from the '70's. For me second time around?... Well I can see some good things in there, but not enough for me to rave about it. I will deem it 'Recommended' but only for these good points (about three quarters of the way through the back-story of Mr. Orange definitely NOT the torture scene).My score: 7.8/10.IMDb Score: 8.4/10 (based on 277,019 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 96/100 (based on 48 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

How to Train Your Dragon," Entertaining... even if the accents are confusing...
","I had heard a lot about this film before seeing it; after all, it was a huge hit when it hit the screens last year. Now showing on TV, I thought it was about time I saw just what all the fuss was about. You'll be pleased to know I wasn't too disappointed, I really enjoyed this tale of Vikings, Dragons and friendship. There were just a couple of niggles, but I'll get to them later.When young Hiccup, son of the town of Berk's leader, Stoick the Vast, decides he wants to fight dragons, he disobeys his father and goes into battle with an invention of his. He brings down a rare dragon, a Night Fury, but finds himself unable to kill it when he finds it the following day. He releases it, but it is injured and needs Hiccup's help to be able to fly again. He calls the dragon Toothless and it's not long before they become friends. Through Toothless, Hiccup learns more about the dragons that have been plaguing his town and that it is not through their own choice. When Stoick discovers the dragon you can tell there's going to be conflict, but will it end well for the boy and his dragon? Well, you've probably guessed I'm not going to tell you here.This film has two things in its favour, a decent plot and some top class animation. It's all beautifully drawn in a similar style to Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009), which I also enjoyed very much. Well voiced by the talents of; Jay Baruchel as Hiccup, Gerard Butler as Stoick, Craig Ferguson as Gobber the Belch, America Ferrera as Astrid, Jonah Hill as Snotlout and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Fishlegs to name but a few.I said at the beginning I had a couple of niggles, well, we'll start with accents. I was always brought up to believe Vikings came from Scandinavia (that's Sweden, Finland, Norway or Denmark). These appear to all come from Scotland for some reason. Also, despite the fact that all their parents speak with Scottish accents, all the kids speak with American accents (very confusing). Furthermore, on a technical note, although I saw it in 2D, the picture seemed very dark, even the outside scenes looked a bit muted. Probably an after-effect of it having been 3D'd for those that like parting with the extra cash. It may have got a higher score were it not for the niggles I've mentioned here.Over all though, it's the story that's important, and this film really delivers on that count. The animation is beautifully done, when it's not too dark to see and the characters are well thought out, despite their unusual choices of accents. I really enjoyed it! Highly recommended.My Score: 8.4/10",8,0,0,29 May 2011
Limitless," Some nice touches in this Sci-Fi/Thriller...
","When I read about the concept behind this film I must say I was quite intrigued; a pill that could allow access to the parts of the brain we don't use? Who could resist? Well it didn't play at my local cinema and so after quite a long wait it finally appeared in the TV listings this week. It had received a bit of a mixed response from the critics but I thought I'd take the plunge anyway. I'll give you my thoughts after this brief summary.Eddie Morra is a struggling writer; he has a contract to write a book but is struggling to find inspiration and motivation. By chance he meets his ex-wife's brother, Vernon, a former drug dealer; he gives him a pill that changes his life. It's called NZT and it enables him to think faster than ever; he finishes his book in double quick time. When the effects wear off he decides he has to get more. He goes to see Vernon who he finds dead. Searching his apartment he discovers his stash and steals it. Now he can take it every day he soon realises that writing isn't for him; stocks and shares are the future. Having had some meteoric success in the stock market, he is now in the spotlight of the big boys. Enter Carl Van Loon, a very successful businessman who takes Eddie under his wing. As a side note, Eddie at this point also gets his girlfriend, Lindy, back. About to broker a major deal; Eddie discovers a disturbing side-effect of the drug I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police (Illegal Drugs Division) will have me banged up for possession.A very well made film with some neat CGI and camera work which is used to try and illustrate the effect of the drug on Eddie. I also liked the narration; it gave an insight into his thought processes as events unfolded around him. Decent performances all round; Bradley Cooper did a good job as Eddie Morra, Robert De Niro was great (as ever), although never really stretched as Carl Van Loon and Abbie Cornish was decent, if underused, as Lindy. Andrew Howard did a good job as the Russian moneylender Gennady and there was a nice little part for Anna Friel as Eddie's ex-wife Melissa.Quite a slick production with some nice touches; not all of them worked, but it's still a perfectly watchable Sci-Fi/Thriller. As I've already said, I did enjoy some of the camera trickery used to illustrate the effect of the drug, in particular the tunnel-like pan straight into the screen, which worked particularly well. There were a few aspects of the plot that didn't quite work for me, but over all it's still pretty enjoyable Recommended.My score: 7.4/10.IMDb Score: 7.3/10 (based on 103,342 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 69/100 (based on 180 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 73/100 (based on 84,511 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",7,0,0,15 January 2012
Eyes Wide Shut," An apt ending point for Kubrick...
","This was Stanley Kubrick's last film and I thought it an apt one for my 400th review. It's maybe not his greatest work, but you can still see the hand of the master in this one. His attention to detail is second to none and you'll struggle to find anything out of place in any shot. As for the plot, well, it's all very psychological and quite complicated, but worth sticking with. If you're bothered by nudity, which few people are these days, but even so, this one may not be to everyone's taste. I'll attempt to give you a brief summary and then some of my thought afterwards.Bill Harford and his wife, Alice, live together with their daughter, Helena, in an apartment in New York. They are quite well off, Bill is a doctor and they enjoy many of the good things in life. And yet they are not happy. After an argument about sexuality, Bill sets out (to put it in basic terms) get laid. Events conspire against him and he fails, but a conversation with a friend, a musician, Nick Nightingale, leads him to a very strange party. Everyone is wearing cloaks and masks and it seems almost everyone is having sex. One of the women there tries to warn him that he may be in danger and he makes to leave, but too late, he is called before their leader to explain himself. Here I will leave my brief summary Thought I'd leave you on a bit of a cliff-hanger this time.At two hours and forty minutes, this is one of the longest movies I've seen. It has a very slow and deliberate pace that, at times, can be a little annoying, but stick with it. To be honest, I had to take a little fifteen minute break in the middle or I wouldn't have made it to the end. The pay-off in the end may not be to everyone's liking and some my even see it as a let-down, but I thought it was OK.As far as performances go, well, Tom Cruise proved that he can do more than stupid action/spy movies as Dr. William 'Bill' Harford. And Nicole Kidman put in a great performance as his wife, Alice. Sydney Pollack was good as Victor Ziegler and Todd Field was also decent as Nick Nightingale.This film has gained a bit of notoriety for the sex scenes in it and, yes, there are sex scenes but there's nothing that breaks any decency laws. I found the film hard going in places but stuck with it. The music is really great too; just listen to the music playing in the background in places and you'll hear some melodies you might just recognise. It's probably the least favourite of the Kubrick films I've seen to date, but it's still worth a viewing (if you can clear a long enough time-slot) Recommended.My Score: 7.3/10",Null,0,0,17 July 2011
The Da Vinci Code," Not as good as the book (IMO), but still worth a look...
","Whilst visiting some friends this film came up in conversation for some reason, I can't exactly remember just why now, but needless to say, a viewing was hastily arranged. Having previously read the book I had a pretty good idea about the storyline and so settled down to enjoy Ron Howard's interpretation. I will give you my thoughts after this very brief summary.A murder has been committed at the Louvre museum in Paris; an eminent professor has been killed, but he has left clues to the identity of his murderer. Robert Langdon, an expert in symbology is called in by the police but do they have an ulterior motive? The victim's granddaughter, cryptologist Sophie Neveu warns Langdon that he is in danger. They manage to fool the police into thinking they've escaped and take to opportunity to look for clues. What they find leads them to a revelation that, if made public, would blow religion wide apart! To this end, they are also pursued by an agent of the church, Silas, a cold blooded killer I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police will have me clapped in irons (again).This is a very well made film that looks great on the screen; you can tell there was a good chunk of money thrown at the project. The music, by Hans Zimmer,was also great and fitted the visuals perfectly. As far as performances go, well I thought the best performance came from Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, for me he stood out. Honourable mentions must go to; Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, Jean Reno as Captain Bezu Fache, Paul Bettany as Silas and Alfred Molina as Bishop Manuel Aringarosa.In scanning through other reviews, the phrase, 'not as good as the book' seems to come up quite a lot, and I must say I agree, the book is better. Having said that, I did find that, although it is very long, the time passed pretty quickly due to the fast-paced storytelling. The problem with this is that it's quite easy to miss a vital piece of the puzzle and that can be annoying. For me, it was a decent effort to put on the screen quite a complicated tale. Unfortunately if falls down because there are just a couple too many coincidences that work out. A blind alley here and there might have helped (IMO). At the end of the day, if you haven't read the book it's still an entertaining watch and one that may well spark a little debate. (It certainly did with me and my friends!) Recommended (just).My Score: 6.5/10.IMDb Score: 6.4/10 (based on 147,704 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 25/100 (based on 220 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

Thor," Lots of Humour... Lots of Drama... & a guy with a BIG hammer!
","I had heard one or two good things about this one before seeing it and so I was looking forward to a nice afternoon's entertainment on a wet Saturday in Yorkshire. It was good, but didn't quite live up to my initial expectations. Instead, I got something with a lot more humour than expected and a lot more drama too, but I guess when you're dealing with the Gods, drama is obligatory.We begin with Thor arriving on Earth and immediately being run over by a vehicle owned by storm chaser, Jane Foster. We then get some explanation of how he ended up there this is quite long and involved, but necessary. In Asgard Thor was war-like and hot headed and, prompted by his brother, Loki, he had defied his father, Odin, and his actions almost caused a war. So Odin took Thor's powers and banished him to Earth. He also sent his hammer with the proviso that it could only be held by someone worthy. Back with Thor, Jane is interested in the 'storm' that brought him to Earth and offers to help him find his hammer if he will tell her about it. Unfortunately, by the time they get to where it's landed, agents from S.H.I.E.L.D. are already there. Back in Asgard Odin falls into a deep sleep and Loki takes over as king, he has his reasons, but I'm not going to tell you what they are here. Believing Thor to be a greater threat to him, he sends the Guardian, a great warrior entity, to destroy him and all those who would oppose it. Can Thor find the humility his father desires to see in him and regain his powers? Will he get the girl at least? All these questions and more are answered in the film I'm not telling you here.As I said at the beginning, there is an awful lot of humour in this film, a lot more than I expected. Of course, Stan Lee gets his little cameo it wouldn't be the same without him. Unfortunately, I found the plot very complicated and there was an awful lot of dialogue explaining everything which tended to get in the way of the story. Having said that, the visuals are quite stunning, the scenes in Asgard and the other worlds are quite breathtaking.Performance wise, everybody did a pretty good job, newcomer Chris Hemsworth was pretty good as Thor, his voice matched the character really well and he had the physical presence too. Natalie Portman, although not at all stretched, did a decent job as Jane Foster. Tom Hiddleston was well cast as Loki, as was Anthony Hopkins as Odin. Honourable mentions go to Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig and Kat Dennings as Darcy Lewis.Over all, although I found it a little long and the plot was a little wordy and hard to follow in places, I pretty much enjoyed this film. One teenager was heard to announce to the audience as he was leaving the cinema that he thought it was 'shit', but I'm not going to listen to this budding 'critic'. There were enough good things about this film to make me want to watch it again sometime maybe not for a while, but it certainly wasn't 'shit' Recommended.My Score: 7.4/10",7,0,0,7 May 2011
Castle in the Sky," One of my favourite Studio Ghibli films!...
","Another in my mini-series of Studio Ghibli films and one I have loved for many years, since I first saw it in fact. I think it is because there is an element of science fiction in this one that doesn't seem to feature a lot in many of the other films I've seen from this studio. If I have one criticism, it's that it's a little too long, but then again it's always interesting and the story does move along at a reasonable pace, so it's not all bad. I'll give you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.A girl, Sheeta, has been taken from her home and is being transported by the army and some mysterious men in dark glasses. When their airship is attacked by pirates she retrieves a mysterious stone from one of the men and jumps from the craft. As she approaches land a light comes from the stone and her fall is slowed. She is seen by a boy, Pazu, who catches her and takes her home with him. Pazu's father had snapped a photo of a mysterious castle in the sky, Laputa, and the following day Sheeta tells him her story and how she has a link to this place. The pirates have tracked her, they are looking for her in the village and a chase ensues. Eventually she is captured, not by the pirates, but by the army! A giant robot, help from the pirates, all kinds of flying machines later and Pazu has her free, but can they find Laputa before the army can, and will it be what they expect when they get there? Well, I guess I can't tell you that here or the Spoiler Police will be sending me aloft in an airship (& no parachute) again.I watched this film in the original Japanese (with subtitles) although I believe there is a dubbed version available for those that fear the written word on the screen. It's beautifully animated and stands up well 25 years later. The performances are all good and so honourable mentions must go to the voice talents of; Mayumi Tanaka as Pazu and Keiko Yokozawa as Sheeta. They both gave their characters a lot of life and urgency that was well reflected in the visuals.I love the plot of this film; it starts quite big and just gets bigger! You think you have an idea where it's going, but then it takes a turn and what they come up with is even better than anything I could have thought of! I must admit I would maybe have changed a couple of things, but over all it's quite an excellent piece of work. It's all excellently done, if a little long, and I think the filmmakers stuck to what they do best; telling a good story. You may be able to guess by now, but this one comes pretty highly RECOMMENDED from me.My score: 8.6/10.IMDb Score: 8.1/10 (based on 30,528 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 94/100 (based on 17 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

Zombieland," Classic Zom-Com with a great soundtrack!
","I sadly missed this one at the cinema last year, not showing at the local and transport issues getting to the nearest Cineplex. So it was with much anticipation I put the DVD into the player. The good news is I like it; I like it a lot! Here's a brief summary then I'll tell you why.As is normal in most zombie films, some mystery virus has turned most of the Worlds population into flesh eating zombies. A young college student, known as Columbus, is making his way back home following a bunch of rules he's made for himself since the world became Zombieland. He meets Tallahassee, a rough tough loner who has a thing for Twinkies. The duo decides to travel together, but is soon met by sisters Wichita and Little Rock, who con them out of their vehicle and weapons. The guys find another vehicle and catch the girls up. To cut a long story short they end up travelling together to Hollywood, and then the fun really starts. I will say no more, I don't want to give too much away.This is a really well made comedy zombie flick. Plenty of blood splatter and very inventive ways found to dispatch the zombie hoards. Great performances from all of the main cast, Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus, Woody Harrelson was particularly good as Tallahassee, Emma Stone as Wichita and Abigail Breslin as Little Rock. There is another major star that has a cameo, but I won't give it away here, just in case you haven't seen it yet.As I said at the beginning, I really like this film; it has a great soundtrack too, if you open with Metallica you're always going to get a vote from me! There are plenty of laughs and also some touching moments too. Over all, recommended, but maybe not for the more squeamish out there.My score: 7.9/10",8,0,0,6 June 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," Deserves its 'Classic' label...
","I have heard many times that this is a classic Christmas film over the years but it has always evaded me, until now. I decided it was time I saw what all the fuss was about and took the plunge when it came up on the TV schedules recently. To be honest, it's better than what I was expecting, although still a little too saccharine in places for my taste. But I digress, here's a very brief summary before I give you more of my thoughts (summary haters please save that drowning angel while I write the next paragraph).George Bailey grew up in the small town of Bedford Falls. He has always wanted to leave and travel the world and find his fortune but the fates have always prevented his leaving. His father runs a local Building and Loan company with George's uncle Billy and when his father dies it is George that is chosen to carry on the business. His brother, Harry, who was supposed to take over when he left college, gets a better offer. Even when he gets married himself, to Mary, and they are about to leave on honeymoon, he is drawn back to the town. When a local businessman, Mr Potter, refuses him a loan after some money is lost, this is the last straw for George and he decides to take his own life, thinking he is worth more dead than alive. At this point an Angel (second class) called Clarence intervenes and shows George what life would be like if he had never existed, and I'm here to tell you it ain't pretty. Better not say any more, don't want to give the ending away.This is a very well made film, with excellent direction from Frank Capra and a tremendous performance from James Stewart as George Bailey. He really steals the show here and, not surprisingly, was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. Honourable mentions must also go to; Donna Reed as Mary Hatch, Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter, Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy and Henry Travers as Clarence.As I said at the beginning, I found this film a little too saccharine in places, but it's still a great film and deserves its 'Classic' label. It is a very long film which mostly deals with events in George's life that lead up to his attempted suicide and it is all very well done. If you haven't seen it before I can highly recommend this film. I am not a religious man myself, but still enjoyed it.My score: 8.7/10",9,1,4,28 December 2010
The Departed," Best since Goodfellas...
","I have lost count of the number of times this film has been recommended to me. Consequently I bought the DVD some time ago but never got round to watching it until now. It is a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film titled Infernal Affairs which was a big hit over there. It deals with crime and police corruption in Boston, and I must admit to those that recommended it to me, it's pretty damn good! More of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters take big Joey for a ride while I write the next paragraph But don't let me catch you readin' it!!!).State Detective, Billy Costigan, is from the South side of town; he has no family to speak of and so is targeted by Cpt. Queenan and Staff Sgt. Dignam who run undercover operations. They persuade him to get in with crime boss, Frank Costello, who they suspect is selling technology to the Chinese, amongst many other crimes. Little do they know that Costello has an inside man on the police task force, Colin Sullivan. Now Sullivan is not able to get the name of the undercover operative in Costello's gang, but tips him off whenever the cops are getting near. After a while the cops become suspicious that Costello has an inside man amongst their ranks and start up an investigation to find out who the rat is. Cpt. Ellerby appoints Sullivan to lead the investigation. Add to this the fact that Costigan is slowly losing his mind the longer it goes on and has to see a police psychiatrist, Madolyn, who just happens to be Sullivan's girlfriend. With both sides slowly closing in on the insiders a tense and shocking climax is in the offing.I must say I really enjoyed this film up to a point. That point is the ending, I would have done it differently, but then who am I to argue with a man like Scorsese? A great script by William Monahan really brought out some great performances. First up I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was outstanding as Billy Costigan, Matt Damon totally made me forget the Bourne films as Colin Sullivan and, of course, Jack Nicholson was great, as ever, as Frank Costello. Also on the role of honour are; Mark Wahlberg as Staff Sgt. Dignam and Martin Sheen as Cpt. Queenan. Honourable mentions go to; Ray Winstone as Mr. French (Costello's top henchman), Vera Farmiga as Madolyn, Anthony Anderson as Brown (a cop) and Alec Baldwin as Cpt. Ellerby.A really engrossing film with just enough twists and turns to keep the audience enthralled without confusing too much. A great script and some really great performances only add to the enjoyment factor. I've already said I have a slight problem with the ending, but it is still a tremendous film and one I don't hesitate to very highly recommend.My score: 9.3/10",9,0,0,21 November 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Great visuals but little depth
","I have to admit I saw this at the cinema when it came out. It was the first film I had seen on the big screen for a long time and I'll admit to having been slightly (very much) blown away by it at the time. Now, just over a year later I have given it a second viewing and, having seen a lot more films in between, I have somewhat changed my opinion. Man can do that right? Change their minds? Just thought I'd check.Optimus Prime and the Autobots, with some new members, are seeking out Decepticon agents around the Earth. They are helped by an international military force called NEST. Sam Witwicky has found a shard of the 'AllSpark', a device which was destroyed in the first Transformers movie, which he accidentally touches. He is preparing to go to college, leaving his girlfriend Mikaela Barnes and Bumblebee, his Autobot guardian, behind. Having arrived at college, he finds himself blacking out and seeing mysterious symbols. A worried Mikaela flies out to join him and Bumblebee also makes his way there to protect his ward. The Decepticons know what these symbols mean and they want Sam I think that's enough about the plot.First of all, the CGI work on this film is excellent, some really cool effects and some excellent stunt work combine to make it visually quite stunning. Unfortunately I found I didn't warm to any of the characters, they had no depth and so it ended up being quite a hollow experience. So with no stand-out performances, honourable mentions go to Shia LaBeouf as Sam and Megan Fox as Mikaela; Josh Duhamel returned as Captain Lennox and John Turturro also returned as Agent Simmons / Jetfire. Kevin Dunn and Julie White also return as Sam's parents Ron and Judy Witwicky. The Transformers were voiced by Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime), Hugo Weaving (Megatron) and Tony Todd (The Fallen).Over all a visually exciting and even, at times, an entertaining film that unfortunately has little depth. The running time is far too long, which also doesn't help. I guess if you're a fourteen year old boy then you'll enjoy this, but ultimately you'll only remember the funny bit on the pyramid and some of the robot fight scenes. So, not really recommended if you're a serious movie lover, but if you're young at heart and want to switch your brain off for a while, go for it!My score: 5.4/10",5,0,7,22 August 2010
Crazy Heart," A great performance from Jeff Bridges...
","I wasn't too sure about this one at first. I'm not a great fan of country music for a start, but I do know a good tune when I hear one and those guys at the Academy can't always be wrong, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm really glad I did! It's a really great film with some cracking songs and some truly great performances. But more of my praise later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please help unload the gear while I write the next paragraph - thanks).Bad Blake is a country singer whose best days are behind him. He plays small bars, bowling alleys; anywhere he can get a gig really. Like many on hard times he has turned to alcohol to ease the pain, but it is clearly doing him no good. While playing in Santa Fe he meets journalist, Jean Craddock, who he begins a relationship with. She has a young son, Buddy, who takes to Bad and it seems things a looking up for the Country star. His agent calls him and tells him he has a gig in Phoenix, opening for his former protégé, and a very successful star, Tommy Sweet. At first he's hesitant, but finally agrees to do the show. He talks to Tommy and Tommy offers to help him out by paying for any new songs Bad has written. The trouble is Bad hasn't written any new material in quite a long time. On his way back to see Jean, Bad has an accident and is laid up for several weeks. During this time he begins to write again, but his alcoholism is about to rear its ugly head. Is Jean his salvation? Well, I guess that would be giving the game away, so I won't tell you here.First of all the music, as I said at the beginning, I'm not a fan of Country music, but I do know a good tune when I hear one, and there are several on show here. The original songs by both Stephen Bruton and T-Bone Burnett are spot on. So good in fact that I bought the soundtrack album. One thing I did note was that there is no incidental music which I found made the film a little sparse. Lots of dialogue can get a bit tedious without anything to break it up. Having said that, I guess it makes the viewer appreciate the performances of the actors more.I am not surprised that Jeff Bridges won the Oscar for Best Actor for his part as Bad Blake; he is truly excellent in this. I must also give praise to Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jean Craddock; I thought she was really good as well. I will also give honourable mentions to; Colin Farrell as Tommy Sweet and Robert Duvall as Bad's friend Wayne (he was also one of the Producers by the way). Both Jeff Bridges and Colin Farrell performed the songs themselves which, I think was, first of all, brave, and secondly, excellently done! Both could have a second career some day.Over all, a really well made film with some great cinematography, the use of the landscape of New Mexico really stood out. Of course, the performances all round were excellent and only added to my enjoyment. It did fall a little flat in the third quarter where the story concentrates on the relationship between Bad and Jean, but I guess that's because there are no songs in that part. Having said that, this is still a film I would still recommend to anyone! If you haven't seen it, please do, it's well worth a look.My score: 8.4/10",8,2,3,15 January 2011
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Indie Teen Comedy with a Great Soundtrack
","I remember back about a year ago I stumbled upon a film called Juno, one of the stars of which was Michael Cera. Now, one of the many things I really liked that film was the understated performance of said Mr Cera. And so we come to 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist', a really bad title IMHO. It's not a bad film, there's a lot to admire, it just fell slightly short of the mark for me. But more of that later, let me tell you a little of the rather complicated plotNick is depressed, he's been dating Tris for a while and she's dumped him. He spends his time making mix CDs for her and generally feeling sorry for himself. Oh, and he's a huge fan of a band called 'Where's Fluffy'. Anyway, he is in a band himself, and the other band members, Thom and Dev, who are gay by the way, decide to take him out into New York, where they have a gig. Meanwhile, Norah and her best friend, Caroline, are also planning a night out in the Big Apple. They know Tris from school and Norah has been listening to, and liking, Nick's CDs that Tris has thrown away. Nick's band is playing in a club when Tris walks in with her new boyfriend. Of course Nick is distracted by this. Caroline has got drunk and Norah is left alone. When Tris comes up to her and asks her who she's with, she says she's with her boyfriend and proceeds to go and kiss Nick, who she's never met before. (Complicated enough so far?) Deciding to help Norah take Caroline home, Nick helps them to his car but before they can leave, the rest of the band decide Nick and Norah should get together and offer to take Caroline home so the couple can go and find where 'Fluffy' is playing that night (it's a secret). From here there are adventures, love, hate, kidnapping and a whole bunch of stuff you're better off finding out by watching it yourselves (he said, wanting to keep the spoiler count to a minimum).I found it quite an engaging film for the most part, with a really good soundtrack and some good performances. The budget was obviously not the biggest, but I thought they production team did a great job despite this. So, good performances from Michael Cera as Nick, Kat Dennings as Norah, Aaron Yoo as Thom, Rafi Gavron as Dev, Ari Graynor as Caroline and Alexis Dziena as Tris.It's a nice gentle teen comedy with some really great moments in it, but, for me, it kind of lost its way towards the end. When I felt the story should be building to a big finish, it all kind of fell flat. Nothing to do with the performances, I think the writers must have just run out of ideas. For all that, it's a pretty nice watch and I kind of recommend the first three quarters but you'll watch all of it, I know you will.My score: 6.2/10",6,0,0,27 March 2010
A Hard Day's Night," 60's fun with them Beatles...
","I'll admit straight off that I am a fan of The Beatles, I love their music, particularly the later stuff, but some of the earlier stuff is pretty good too. This film was made when they were at the height of their fame in 1964. Beatlemania was sweeping the world and it seemed they could do no wrong. Personally, I was way too young to be aware of all this, but I think there's been enough written about it and there's enough footage kicking around from then to get the idea.The film focuses on the band and a period of 36 hours leading up to a live TV appearance. They are joined by Paul's grandfather, a 'mixer' as Paul calls him. Basically, he likes to wind everyone up so they end up having arguments. Of course he causes much mayhem, particularly for the band's manager, Norm, for the purposes of the film, and his assistant Shake. Throw into the mix a highly neurotic TV director and a collection of Beatles' hits from the time and you've got the makings of a film.Now, the acting is not of the highest quality from the band members, although Ringo does show a little promise. Of the other performers, Wilfrid Brambell did a great job as the evil old grandfather (very clean though). Norman Rossington was very harassed as Norm and John Junkin did a good job as the clueless Shake. For me, the best performance came from Victor Spinetti as the highly strung TV director, he was great. Of course, John was played by John Lennon, Paul by Paul McCartney, George by George Harrison and Ringo by Ringo Starr.As a film, I didn't find this very good, it's quite a mess with much chaos around everything the band do. I don't know, maybe it really was like that for them back then. The plot is pretty weak, but it does the job of showcasing the band and, more importantly, their songs, which were, for me, the highlight of the piece. I guess if you're a fan of The Beatles then you'll enjoy this immensely, and so, for you lot, recommended. If you're not a fan then I'd probably give it a miss, it's not a great piece of filmmaking.My Score: 6.4/10",6,1,3,29 April 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Excellent, if slightly 'Theactrical'...
","Based on a novel by Ken Kesey, and later a play by Dale Wasserman, this film won 5 Oscars including; Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress. So it looks like it's a 'must see', which, to a large extent, it is. I did find, though, that as a translation of a novel/stage play to the big screen it did suffer from being just a little too, well, theatrical (for want of a better word). I don't want to detract from some truly excellent performances, but, as a whole, I did come away very slightly disappointed. As usual, my thoughts after this brief summary.R.P. McMurphy has been transferred from a local prison to a mental hospital for observation. The authorities believe he is trying to feign mental illness to get out of his work detail and, to this end, they want a professional opinion. He is put into a ward under the watchful care of Nurse Ratched, a quite formidable, but caring, woman. The other 'inmates' have a variety of problems and demonstrate these in a variety of ways. McMurphy immediately tries to put his brand of democracy on his comrades in his first group discussion, but Nurse Ratched is having none of it. Thus begins a battle of wills that, at times is frustrating, uplifting, funny and even tragic. Life continues like this, and McMurphy even makes a big enough impact to be kept there and not be returned to prison. But when he discovers that he is not just there until the end of his sentence, but until they decide he's sane enough to leave, things take a turn. Now determined to leave for good, McMurphy hatches a plan to escape with at least one of his new friends. I'll leave it here so the Spoiler Police don't try to put me back in that institution.As I've already hinted, tremendous performances from both the leading man, Jack Nicholson as R.P. McMurphy and the leading lady, Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched. Both were superb; Nicholson with his free-flowing, improvised style and Fletcher with her more measured approach. Also worthy of note were; Danny DeVito, who I hardly recognised, as Martini, Sydney Lassick as Charley Cheswick, Christopher Lloyd as Taber, Vincent Schiavelli as Fredrickson, Brad Dourif as Billy Bibbit, Mews Small as Candy and, not forgetting, Will Sampson as Chief Bromden.I did find this film a little bit like watching a play at times, it did branch out occasionally, but the vast majority of the action takes place on the ward, which I did find slightly claustrophobic. It was very well made, with quite a few scenes, particularly those featuring Jack Nicholson, being improvised to some extent. I really enjoyed these scenes, as they were allowed to evolve I would really love to see some outtakes! Over all though, an interesting film that deserves all the accolades it's got over the years For me, a little bit too much like a play, but then I can only be honest about how I feel about it. Even so, highly recommended.My Score: 9.1/10.IMDb Score: 8.9/10 (based on 260,412 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 96/100 (based on 51 reviews counted when this review was written).",Null,1,3,20 August 2011
Shooter," A decent action-thriller...
","This film is based on a novel by Stephen Hunter caller 'Point of Impact'. It charts the betrayal of a marine sniper and his efforts to clear his name. Originally set around the time of the Vietnam War, the film brings events up to date and into the 21st Century. There's plenty of action and explosions, and even a damsel in distress, so it covers most of the bases. I'll give you my thoughts after a brief summary.Marine sniper, Bob Lee Swagger is on a mission in Africa when is spotter, and best friend, Donnie Fenn is killed. Left to die by his superiors, he eventually gets out and immediately resigns his commission. Three years later he's living alone in the mountains with his dog when a Colonel Isaac Johnson comes to him with a proposal. There has been a threat on the President and they believe only a highly trained sniper could carry it out. They want Swagger to scout out possible locations and report back to them. They play on his patriotism and eventually he agrees. On the day the threat is due to become real; they insist he attends in order to advise them. Little does Swagger know, he is about to be set up. Injured, he escapes and, with the help of a couple of friends, he plots his revenge.A very well made film with some nice action scenes, stunt work and CGI. A decent plot with plenty of twists and turns, not all of them too predictable, thankfully. Performance wise, I thought Mark Wahlberg did a decent job as Bob Lee Swagger, as did Michael Peña as FBI agent Nick Memphis. Of the bad guys, the pick of the bunch were, Danny Glover as Colonel Isaac Johnson and Ned Beatty as Senator Charles F. Meachum. Oh, and I should also mention the damsel in distress, Kate Mara as Sarah Fenn.As revenge thrillers go, this is pretty run-of-the-mill stuff. There are no stand-out performances, outstanding dialogue or even radical plot-twists. One thing that did strike me was the total lack of humour, not even one wise-crack from a bad guy quite disappointing. But having said all that, it does do what it says on the tin and I did find it quite entertaining. It's never going to win any prizes, but still Recommended.My Score: 6.7/10",7,1,1,3 July 2011
The Lion King," Waited 18 years to see it... Worth the wait?...
","Although it was good, and great for younger viewers, I guess I was expecting something a little more epic. Not that I was particularly disappointed, I suppose all those rave reviews I read maybe upped my expectations a tad. At the end of the day it does what it says on the tin and you really cannot ask for more. It does stand out as one of the better Disney animated films its era, that's a given, but I must say I have seen later films that are equally as good, or even better. Even so, it will still delight, amuse and entertain and I cannot knock it for that Recommended.My score: 8.2/10.IMDb Score: 8.3/10 (based on 220,746 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 89/100 (based on 92 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 89/100 (based on 1,177,009 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,1,2,8 February 2012
Inception," At last! An intelligent Blockbuster!!!
","If you can suspend you belief in reality for 148 minutes then this is the film for you, if you can't then it may only confuse you. Fortunately I am of the former persuasion and was very intrigued to see Christopher Nolan's latest effort, particularly given the reception it has initially received. And so, having avoided seeing anything much beyond the trailer I took my seat in the theatre and waited with much anticipation for it to start.I will keep my summary very brief and try not to give away any spoilers, this is best seen without knowing too much about it. Cobb is a thief, using technology he can go into your dreams and steal your secrets. He can't do it alone though, he needs a team around him for backup, to design the dreamscape, to chemically induce the dream and someone to wake them all up when the mission is completed. He finds that committing industrial espionage is a good way to make a living while he figures out a way to get back home to see his estrange kids. He cannot go and see them because he is implicated in the untimely death of their mother, Mal, who still haunts his dreams. When a powerful industrialist, Saito, comes to him with a proposal he is interested, particularly when the fee is to be his longed for reunion with his children. There's just one snag, the job will entail inception, planting an idea in someone's mind via their dreams, a very risky process. I'll leave it there or I may say too much, but that's a very general outline.This is without doubt one of the best films I've seen ever. Always engaging, entertaining, sad, dramatic, action-packed, enthralling, intriguing and above all, intelligent. It kept me gripped from start to finish, which is a long time to be gripped, believe me! Although it's pure fiction, I found it easy to identify with the characters which is testament to both the writing and the performances of the entire cast. So, hats off to, Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur, Ellen Page as Ariadne, Tom Hardy as Eames, Ken Watanabe as Saito, Dileep Rao as Yusef, Marion Cotillard as Mal and Cillian Murphy as Robert Fischer, Jr. Also honourable mentions go to Tom Berenger as Browning, Pete Postlethwaite as Maurice Fischer and Michael Caine as Miles.The effects were amazing, not an awful lot of CGI used, but some excellent wire work, physical effects and some use of miniatures was really effective. The scene (it's in the trailer) where gravity is lost in the building is quite breathtaking. A word of warning though, be sure you won't need a toilet break, if you do, you could find yourself lost in this most excellent and labyrinthine plot. I cannot praise everyone who worked on this one enough, in particular Christopher Nolan, a brilliant film and very very highly RECOMMENDED!!.My score: 9.7/10",10,3,8,17 July 2010
Defiance," An awe-inspiring tale of survival...
","This film has been lurking in my DVD collection for quite a while now, and so I thought it was a bit overdue a viewing. Finding myself at a loose end on a Sunday afternoon afforded the ideal opportunity. At two hours eleven minutes it's a pretty long film, which probably explains why it has remained unwatched for so long. But enough of this, you want to hear about the film. The setting is Belarus in the early 1940's. The German army has invaded and is beginning it's persecution of the Jews in the region oh, and by the way, it's based on a true story.After their parents are killed, three brothers, Tuvia, Zus and Asael Bielski, seek refuge in the forests near their home. They are soon joined by other survivors and it's soon apparent that, as the oldest, Tuvia must take charge. The brothers are not the most law-abiding citizens and find their skills at smuggling are soon to be very useful. After finding out who was responsible for his parents' murder, Tuvia exacts revenge on a local policeman and his family. As more and more survivors join the group tension mounts between Tuvia and Zus as they differ on how they should proceed. This culminates in a fight and Zus leaving to join the local brigade of the Red Army. Eventually the camp is discovered by the police and they are forced to move and, as winter approaches, life becomes very tough for the survivors. They now number in the hundreds and Asael meets a girl and marries her. They survive the winter only to discover that the Germans intend to sweep through the forest and take, or kill anyone they find. Zus is ordered by the Russian commander to retreat, leaving the Jews at the mercy of the approaching Nazis. And on that knife-edge, I'll leave my short synopsis.This is a pretty well made film with some nice action sequences interspersing the drama. Decent performances all round particularly from Daniel Craig as Tuvia, Liev Schreiber as Zus and Jamie Bell as Asael. All three stood out and put in really good performances. I should also give honourable mentions to Alexa Davalos as Lilka Ticktin, Allan Corduner as Shimon Haretz, Mark Feuerstein as Isaac Malbin and Tomas Arana as Ben Zion Gulkowitz.As I mentioned at the beginning, it's a pretty long film, and, despite this, I felt the filmmakers were still trying to fit too much in. It is a fascinating and awe inspiring story that deserves to be told, but I just felt it could have been done better. So, over all, it's a pretty good film that doesn't quite reach the standard set by the likes of Schindler's List, but still a worthy effort. Recommended if you can spare the 2 hours, 11 minutes.My score: 7.3/10",7,1,3,10 October 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Very enjoyable!...
","I originally saw this one at the cinema in early 2010; it was a small room, packed out and not much of an enjoyable viewing experience. It has now made it to the small screen and I am able to watch it in comfort so much better! Now, I don't know if it was the better viewing conditions, or the fact I have a better sound system than my local cinema, but I enjoyed this one a tad more second time around. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please walk Gladstone, the dog, while I write the next paragraph).Holmes and Watson occupy rooms at 221b Baker Street, however, their idyll is soon to be disturbed because Watson has got engaged and plans to move out to be with his new bride. It's Victorian London and they currently have more pressing matters, the game's afoot! We begin with Holmes and Watson closing in on Lord Blackwood, who is in the throws of performing a satanic ritual in the catacombs below London. They successfully apprehend him and he is arrested by Inspector Lestrade. Sentenced to death, Lord Blackwood calls for Holmes and warns him that there will be four more murders. Having been hanged and pronounced dead, by Watson, his body is interred. The following day his tomb has been opened from the inside and he has been seen wandering about the graveyard. It seems Holmes and Watson have another mystery to solve. At this point, Irene Adler, a former adversary of Holmes appears on the scene and commissions him to find a man involved in the Blackwood case. This will lead them to a conspiracy that threatens the bedrock of British society. She is in the employ of a very mysterious stranger, a professor of some kind. I think that's enough to whet you appetite I don't want to give the game away.A very well made film with plenty of action and some really great comedic moments. I loved the interplay between Holmes and Watson; they were almost like an old married couple at times, which was really amusing. Great performances from all of the leading cast, Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes, Jude Law as Dr. John Watson, Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, Mark Strong as Lord Blackwood, Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lastrade and Robert Maillet as Derdger, Holmes's fighting nemesis.I found this a most enjoyable film to watch second time around. The score, by Hans Zimmer was spot on and fitted the action on screen perfectly. Although the dialogue does get a little bogged down at times, there was still plenty to keep the viewer's attention. The fight scenes, and one scene in particular featuring an explosion in slow motion were all excellent hats off to the stunt and technical guys for those! Over all, very entertaining and well worth a viewing!... Recommended.My score: 7.8/10",8,1,2,9 January 2011
WALL·E," Even better second time around!...
","As I may have mentioned before, I'm quite a big fan of animated films. I have some friends who will only watch anime, but I have a much broader palate. I wasn't going to watch this today when it came up on TV as I had seen it before, but I got enchanted by it all over again and ended up sitting all the way through it (again).All life has left the Earth, it sounds pretty bleak, but it's not really, they've gone on a big space ship while an army of robots cleans up the place. And now, some 800 years later, there's only one robot left, Wall-e. He spends his days collecting and compacting the garbage and making enormous towers out of it. He's not alone though, and insect, probably a cockroach, is his companion. Wall-e lives in the back of an old truck, where, apart from a bunch of spare parts, he also has a collection of interesting things he's found over the years. Amongst these is a video of an old musical that he plays every night, and a plant that he found.One day he's going about his business when a spacecraft arrives and drops off another robot, EVE. After a bit of a sticky start, they begin to talk and Wall-e shows EVE around. She has spent most of her time going around scanning everything she sees, looking for something. Later, with a big storm brewing, Wall-e takes EVE to his 'house'; he shows her some of the things he's collected. When she sees the plant she immediately puts it inside her chest and shuts down. Wall-e is dumbfounded and tries to revive her, but fails. All he can do is wait with her until the spacecraft returns, which eventually it does. As it takes off, Wall-e stows away and he is taken to another, much larger ship, the Axiom where the humans are. This is where things start to get interesting, so I'll leave it here.This is a very well made film with some great comic touches, particularly in the opening scenes. The first third of the film was really engaging and very enjoyable, however, as soon as Wall-e and EVE make it to the Axiom it becomes slightly more predictable, which is a shame. There isn't a great deal of dialogue, but it was all done well, honourable mentions go to the voice talents of, Ben Burtt as Wall-e & M-O, Elissa Knight as EVE and Jeff Garlin as Captain McCrea.This is the second time I've seen this film and I can say I enjoyed it much more second time around. The filmmakers are great at giving characters to the robots, even though they cannot really talk properly. I found the opening scenes particularly good, although I didn't much care for the song from the musical that they kept playing. I guess Wall-e is so appealing because he looks a little like the iconic alien, E.T. As I said, the latter scenes when they make it to the Axiom do get a little predictable, but I still found it very enjoyable Recommended.My score: 8.7/10",9,0,1,30 May 2011
The Blind Side," Better than expected...
","This film was nominated for the best picture Oscar in 2010, it didn't win, but Sandra Bullock did pick up the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role. Given all this recognition I decided I'd better see what all the fuss was about. I have to say that, as a Brit, I and don't really follow any American sports which it made it a little hard to follow in places, but I expected that. I've seen the Super Bowl on TV and have seen films such as 'Any Given Sunday' which have given me a bit of an insight into the game and the attention it gets over there. Having said that, the film isn't all about American Football, it's more about relationships and how helping out a fellow human being can bring something good. Oh, and it's based on a true story. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please block that guy trying to sneak around the sideline while I write the next paragraph).Michael 'Big Mike' Oher has had it rough all his life, his mother is a crack addict, his father has disappeared, but he has one thing in his favour, he's big really big. More by luck than design, he gets enrolled into a predominantly white Christian school. His teachers don't really hold out much hope for him since he seems disinterested in classes, but one teacher, Mrs. Boswell, discovers he is maybe not as dumb as they first thought. He is befriended by young S.J. Tuohy, the son of Leigh Ann and Sean Tuohy. Recognising that Michael has nobody to look after him, Leigh Ann decides to take him in. Eventually his grades improve and he is allowed to play sports. He is, not surprisingly chosen for the Football team. After a stuttering start, and a bit of coaching from Leigh Ann and S.J., he finally gets the hang of the game and from here, as they say, the rest is history. I'll leave my summary here so as not to infringe those NFL Spoiler Police.This is a very heart-warming film that will appeal to the North American audience more than most of the rest of the world. I found it to be very well made with a few good performances. As far as that goes, I thought Sandra Bullock was good as Leigh Ann Tuohy, but Oscar worthy? I'll let you decide. Tim McGraw did a fair job as Sean Tuohy and I thought Quinton Aaron played the understated Michael Oher very well. Jae Head reminded me a little of a young Macaulay Culkin as S.J. Tuohy and Lily Collins was OK as Collins Tuohy (the daughter). Honourable mentions go to Ray McKinnon as Coach Burt Cotton, Kim Dickens as Mrs. Boswell and there was a nice cameo from Kathy Bates as Miss Sue.So we have a very rich family taking in a young black boy who happens to be an athlete. The cynical among us would instantly put this back on the shelf and leave it there, but I found it surprisingly better than I first thought it would be. Mainly due to the understated performance of Quinton Aaron, his performance really made the story work (for me). Contrast that with the outgoing and boisterous S.J. and it's a combination that really works. The scenes where this pair is on screen really stand out. Over all, I found it a little too long and a little too schmaltzy for my taste, but worth one viewing Recommended, for the one viewing only then you can move on.My Score: 6.4/10",6,2,2,9 April 2011
Rango," Animated fun with the voice talents of Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher and Ned Beatty
","This is a film I've wanted to see for some time, although I didn't know all that much about it. Recommendations did the trick, but it never made it to my local cinema and so I waited for a TV airing. As you can probably guess, it aired this week and I'm pleased to say the recommendations were correct! Although not quite up there with the best of the Pixar films, it's still very entertaining and beautifully animated. I will give you my thoughts after this brief summary.When a pet chameleon is involved in an accident that leaves him on a desert road, he looks for help. It first comes in the form of an old armadillo called Roadkill; he sets the chameleon off in the direction of the nearest town, Dirt. On the way he is picked up by Beans who is going to town for supplies for her ranch. Once there the chameleon enters the saloon where he makes himself out to be a bit of a hero a hero called Rango! The townsfolk immediately make him the sheriff; but there's a problem. The town is running out of water, there's very little left in the bank and the mayor is behaving strangely. When the remaining water is stolen from the bank it's up to Rango, and a posse, to go and bring it back. Also, can they solve the mystery of the disappearing water supply? Well, I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be confiscating my glass of nice cool refreshing water by my side here (thirsty?).As I've already said, it's beautifully animated and well worth seeing just for that alone! As for performances, well everyone was very good, particularly Johnny Depp as Rango/Lars, he surprised me with this performance; very reminiscent, at times, of his character, Raoul Duke, in 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. Isla Fisher as Beans and Abigail Breslin as Pricilla both put in great performances, as did Ned Beatty as the Mayor. Honourable mentions must also go to; Alfred Molina as Roadkill, Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake, Stephen Root as Doc/Merrimack/Mr. Snuggles, Harry Dean Stanton as Balthazar, Timothy Olyphant as Spirit of the West and Ray Winstone as Bad Bill.I must say I did like the offbeat style of this film, very reminiscent of an old Western but with a modern twist. Lots of slapstick comedy moments and some great sight gags add to the fun. A nice score by Hans Zimmer is interspersed by a nice collection of songs, principally performed by 'Los Lobos'. Over all, I found this film very entertaining with some great animation; one I will definitely re-watch sometime Recommended.My score: 7.9/10.IMDb Score: 7.4/10 (based on 57,195 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 88/100 (based on 205 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 69/100 (based on 94,672 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",8,2,3,8 January 2012
Centurion," A very gory action adventure...
","This is another take on the legend of the Ninth Legion of Rome. They disappeared in mysterious circumstances when fighting the Picts (Scots) during the time of the Roman occupation of Britain. It's quite an exciting tale with a lot of blood, guts and gore along the way. Although it's far from perfect, I quite liked it for its fast pace and some excellent fight scenes.The Ninth Legion, lead by General Titus Flavius Virilus are sent north to wipe out the troublesome Picts lead by the fearsome Gorlacon. Amongst their number is Centurion Quintus Dias, who has been posted to the region and knows the type of enemies they will face. They also have a Pict tracker in the shape of the mute Etain, she possesses great skill when it comes to finding the enemy. The Legion is ambushed and almost all are slaughtered, but a handful remain alive and try at first to rescue their captured General and then try to get back south to safety. With the Picts hot on their trail and the elements and terrain against then, can they survive long enough to make it home.This film obviously didn't have a huge budget, but considering the limited resourced they had, I think it wasn't a bad effort. A decent cast was lead by Michael Fassbender as Centurion Quintus Dias, with Dominic West as General Titus Flavius Virilus, David Morrissey as Bothos, Ulrich Thomsen as Gorlacon, Olga Kurylenko as Etain, Liam Cunningham as Brick and Imogen Poots (great name!) as Arianne. All did a good job in, what must have been very trying circumstances.The plot is quite fast and exciting with some great fight sequences and a few edge-of-your-seat moments. All this was very good and I was enjoying the chase with a nice little dose of betrayal and intrigue thrown in. Unfortunately about two thirds of the way through all the momentum is lost when the surviving few stop to lick their wounds at the house of an outcast. Although an attempt is made to regain some of the lost inertia, it fails to reach the same level. While I thought this section could have bee shorter to help the pacing, I still thought it was a pretty good film. It has a 15 certificate here in the UK which surprised me a little given the level of violence depicted. But over all, a decent enough film (with a few reservations) Recommended (just).My Score: 7.1/10",7,1,3,1 May 2011
Scream," Enjoyed it a lot more than expected...
","I have been recently reading a lot of reviews of the latest film in this series, Scream 4. Now, for one reason or another I have never seen any of the 'Scream' films before well not all the way through anyway. Time to change that I thought and so here we are with the first one, Scream. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would, it doesn't take itself all that seriously and there's an awful lot more humour than I expected.We open with a mysterious voice calling up a girl called Casey, who is home alone about to watch a scary movie. She tries to blow him off but he is persistent and eventually begins to creep her out. Things don't end too well for Casey, or her boyfriend, Steve, after a masked assailant has finished with them. We then switch to another girl, Sidney, her mother had been murdered almost a year ago and her father is about to leave on a business trip. All the talk the next day at school is about the murder and on returning home Sidney receives a call from a man with a mysterious voice. She isn't so easily scared, but still she is attacked by the same masked assailant. Having fought him off, her boyfriend, Billy turns up just before Deputy Dewey. Having found a cell phone on him, Dewey arrests Billy and Sidney goes to stay the night with Dewey's sister, Tatum. As time goes by the bodies begin to mount up and this attracts the media, particularly ambitious reporter, Gale Weathers. It's only a matter of time before Sidney is to be the next on the list, and anyway, there's a score to settle and an awful lot of suspects.This made a refreshing change for me, a horror film that doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time has all the scares and shocks of a more serious one. I liked it! Decent performances all round; Neve Campbell did a good job as Sidney, as did Skeet Ulrich as Billy. Also of note were Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquette as Deputy Dewey and Matthew Lillard as Stuart. Also nice cameos from Drew Barrymore as Casey, Wes Craven very briefly appeared as Fred the Janitor and Henry Winkler as Principal Arthur Himbry.There is a great soundtrack too, including an interesting acoustic rendition of 'Don't Fear the Reaper' when Sidney and Billy are first seen on screen together (very nicely done). I suspect, unfortunately, that the other films in the series may not live up to this rather good beginning, but we shall see If you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth a viewing, even if you're not really a fan of teen horrors (like me) Final verdict: Recommended.My Score: 7.5/10",8,9,10,28 May 2011
Halloween," The original and still the best
","I got a little behind on my Halloween film watching and so I had to put this one back a bit. Not to worry, it's still a great horror film even if you don't watch it on its' title night. It has been a long time since I last saw it and I had forgotten just how good it was. Yes, it's dated, but that doesn't detract from the way Carpenter draws the audience in to the horrors to come. I'll give you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.We first witness the 6 year old Michael Myers murder his older sister on Halloween night 1963. Flashing forwards 15 years, October 30th, we see him escape the mental institution he has been kept in since then. We are also introduced to Dr. Sam Loomis, who firmly believes Myers to be pure evil. The next day, back in Michael Myers' home town we meet Laurie Strode and her friends Annie Brackett and Lynda van der Klok who are planning their Halloween night. Two of them are babysitting, but there are plans, for two of them at least, to get together with their boyfriends later. Laurie has the feeling someone is watching them though and she's right. Dr. Loomis has also arrived in town, he has a feeling also that an old resident may be returning home. I'll leave it there so as not to upset the Spoiler Police (Horror Movie Division).A really well made film with some iconic scenes and a film that is genuinely scary. One of the things that strikes you about it is the music, also written by John Carpenter. It's atmospheric and it has a refrain that everyone knows and associates with this film. All the performances were excellent; Jamie Lee Curtis in her first starring role did a great job as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasence was great (as ever) as Dr. Sam Loomis. Also worthy of note were; Nancy Kyes as Annie Brackett, P.J. Soles as Lynda van der Klok and Charles Cyphers as Sheriff Leigh Brackett.Of course all the usual horror movie clichés are here, including my pet favourite; walking into a dark room and NOT turning the lights on. Despite this I still very much enjoyed the way Carpenter slowly builds up the tension. The horror is in what he doesn't show on the screen and that is what makes this a properly scary movie. The best pictures, I find, are those you make up in your own imagination and Carpenter allows us room to do that. As I've already said, it's quite dated, but that doesn't detract from it, it's still a great horror film and one I have no problem in deeming Recommended.My score: 7.9/10 IMDb Score: 7.9/10 (based on 76,702 votes at the time of going to press).",8,1,4,6 November 2011
Paths of Glory," Classic Kubrick!
","I am a bit of a fan of Stanley Kubrick and have decided to try and watch as many of his films as I can. This one was showing one afternoon and so it was duly recorded for a viewing at a later date. That later date came around today. Set during World War I, this film tells the story of a French Colonel who ends up with the unenviable task of defending three of his soldiers who are charged with cowardice.Colonel Dax, a lawyer in civilian life, cares very much about his troops and tries to do his best for them. When ordered by General Mireau to attack a well defended position called the 'Ant Hill', he follows orders, but the enemy proves too strong and his troops have to fall back. One platoon is trapped in the trenches and the General orders his own artillery to open fire on them. This order is not obeyed despite the General's threats to the officer commanding the artillery battery. After this debacle, and wishing to make an example, the General, along with his colleague, General Broulard, agrees to Court Martial three men for cowardice. Colonel Dax decides to act as their defence, but is not hopeful of a good outcome. The penalty for this crime is death by firing squad. The three men are selected by their unit commanders. At this point I'll leave my brief summary, I won't tell you the outcome because I don't want to give away too much.An excellent example of the filmmaker's art, I couldn't find fault with this film. It may look dated by today's standards, but given the era it was made and the budget available, it's a fine job. Also guilty of doing a great job was Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax, he really stands out as a quality actor in this one. Also worthy of note were Ralph Meeker as Cpl. Philippe Paris, Adolphe Menjou as Gen. George Broulard and George Macready as Gen. Paul Mireau.Everything about this film is well done, that is with one exception. The sound in the court martial scene is terrible, it's a big room and I found the echo of the voices quite an annoyance. That aside though, I thought the anti-war message got through loud and clear and you are left with no doubt who the enemy really is. I really enjoyed watching this film and I can recommend it very highly.My Score: 9.1/10",9,1,3,9 July 2011
Despicable Me," Highly enjoyable animated fun!...
","I seem to remember this getting a fairly patchy response from the critics when it came out probably all that 3D nonsense. Fortunately I managed to avoid all that by waiting for it to appear on TV in the correct number of dimensions for the screen. As for the film, well I really enjoyed it! Likable characters, a nice plot and some great comic moments who could ask for more!? I'll give you further thoughts after this brief summary.Gru is a villain, he's been a villain for a long time, but now his evil deeds are being superseded by much younger up-and-coming villains. He's not happy, even his mother finds him a bit of a disappointment, but he has a plan. It's a very cunning and dastardly plan, but he'll need to steal a shrink ray gun and borrow some money from the bank first. He steals the ray, but it's stolen from him by a young upstart villain called Vector. Gru tries to retrieve it but cannot gain entry to his compound. Seeing three orphan girls get in by selling cookies, Gru forms another plan. He goes to Miss Hattie's Orphanage and adopts the three girls; Margo, Edith and Agnes. His plan: to get them into the compound so he can plant something there that will allow him to gain access to the ray gun. His many minions and Dr. Nefario help him with this clever scheme and it is a success but the girls have other ideas about Gru and, it seems, they just might be turning him away from his ultimate goal To steal the ****! Oops, hope I didn't say too much there Sorry Spoiler Police I, I'll come quietly.As I've already said, I enjoyed this film very much, it must me my kind of humour or something, but there were far more 'laugh out loud' moments (for me) than usual. The animation was very well done, I'd go so far as to say it was almost up to Pixar standard. I loved Steve Carell as the voice of Gru, his Russian accent was hilarious. Also worthy of note were the voice talents of; Jason Segel as Vector, Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario, Julie Andrews as Gru's Mom, Will Arnett as Mr, Perkins, Kristen Wiig as Miss Hattie, Miranda Cosgrove as Margo, Dana Gaier as Edith and Elsie Fisher as Agnes.One of the things I like to write about when reviewing a film is how it makes me feel. Well, this film did pull at the heartstrings a little, but much more than that it made me laugh. It's definitely one I will re-visit at some point because I'm sure there are many subtle little jokes I missed first time around. Whether you're young or slightly older (like me), I'm sure you'll get some laughs out of this one It's not perfect, but I very much enjoyed it nonetheless Recommended.My Score: 8.4/10.IMDb Score: 7.5/10 (based on 68,835 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 81/100 (based on 187 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",8,1,1,18 October 2011
Raging Bull," Boxing, violence & it's in black & white... Not bad!
","I have to admit first of all that I'm not a great fan of boxing, but I know who Jake La Motta was and I'm aware of what he achieved. This biopic tells of his rise to fame, but it also tells of his life out of the ring, about his brother, his wife and how he eventually fell from grace, only to get up again. But more of that later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please take fifteen rounds with Sugar Ray while I write the next paragraph).As we begin, Jake La Motta is already a well known boxer, he is married to his first wife with whom he constantly argues. He is managed by his brother Joey who does his best to get him fights in the hope he'll get a shot at the title. It seems a long time coming but Jake has other things on his mind at the moment. He as seen a girl, Vickie, who has taken his eye. She is blonde and very popular with everyone, including the rich Salvy, another local guy from the Bronx. But Jake is determined and eventually makes her his. They eventually marry, but Jake is always wary of other men, including his brother, around his wife. This streak of jealousy will eventually cost him dearly. Inside the ring, he has no such problems, beating all comers, and beating them so well that nobody wants to fight him. Eventually his chance comes, but there's a catch... And there, I'll have to leave it as the spoiler police would lock me up if I said any more.Shot almost entirely in black and white, this film has the look and feel of one made back in the 1940's to 1950's. This works very well to give the atmosphere of the period in which it is set. A nice, mostly unobtrusive, score also works very well to set the tone of the movie. I thought Robert De Niro was tremendous as Jake La Motta, he gave his all for this part, even putting on a lot of weight for the latter scenes where La Motta becomes a stand-up comedian. Joe Pesci was also excellent as his brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty was good too as the sultry Vickie.This film is seen by many as a modern classic, and I can see why, it is very good I can't deny Scosese's skill. I think the main problem I found with it was that I didn't find it particularly entertaining. It's very melodramatic in places, but it didn't grip me in the way I expected or maybe I'm being too harsh. De Niro is truly excellent too, but a great performance doesn't always make for a great film I'm afraid. If you haven't seen it before then I can definitely recommend it to you for at least one viewing, if just for De Niro. I'll maybe watch it again in a few years and rave about it, but for now, it's very very good but not great.My score: 8.4/10",8,1,1,20 March 2011
The Woman in Black," Atmospheric and creepy... Definitely not one for the youngsters...
","This film has quite a slow deliberate pace that adds to the atmosphere and suspense of the storyline. It also heightens the effect of the shocks that hit you every now and then. The plot is quite grown up and I have heard it said that when they set the certificate here in the UK at 12A, it should mean 12 and no younger and I entirely agree. There were a few younger than 12 in the audience with me today and I can almost guarantee most of them will be having nightmares tonight. On a personal level, I enjoyed it very much. It has be criticised for there not being enough scares in it, but for me there was just enough (given its certification). Over all, if you're over 12 and like being scared Recommended.My score: 7.3/10.IMDb Score: 7.0/10 (based on 15,376 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 65/100 (based on 161 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 63/100 (based on 36,665 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,1,4,3 March 2012
Mary and Max," Well worth a look!
","I knew very little about this film before seeing it; I knew it was animated and that it was an Australian film. Someone had mentioned it online, stating it was pretty good and so I added it to 'The List' and waited for it to appear. It finally did and I duly recorded it expecting some strange Aussie humour. To be honest, I wasn't quite sure what I was going to see when I hit the play button. Imagine my surprise when I found a wonderful, funny and deeply touching story, beautifully animated with such great characters. I would even go so far as to say I loved it! (And I don't say that often!). Rather than give a summary, I'll give you a very brief outline of what the film is about.Mary is a lonely eight year old girl who lives in the suburbs of Melbourne (Australia). One day she randomly picks a name from an American phone book she finds in the local post office. She writes to one Max Horovitz, a forty four year old man who lives in New York (USA that's just for balance). The unlikely pair strike up a friendship and write to each other on and off over the next twenty years. I really don't want to say too much more, but the film covers issues like loneliness, mental health, love and hate, it's all quite grown up, so not really one for the kids. I think I stopped just before the Spoiler Police wrapped me up and sent me to their pen pal in Alaska.The two main characters are fully rounded and you get a great sense of what they are feeling due to an excellent script and also to the voice talents of the actors playing their parts. So I must give praise to the voice talents of both Toni Collette as Mary Daisy Dinkle and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Max Jerry Horovitz. Also, the narrator, voiced by Barry Humphries had a great part to play, so a big chunk of praise going his way too.Made in the 'claymation' style favoured by the Ardman studio here in the UK (responsible for the likes of 'Wallace and Gromit' amongst others), I thought it was really well done. Lots of little visual gags in amongst the rather serious story that unfolds. It's witty, intelligent, charming, but there are also some serious messages in there. I found it quite touching at the end, but I can't really talk about the ending here. Over all HIGHLY Recommended.My score: 9.2/10.IMDb Score: 8.2/10 (based on 31,658 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 94/100 (based on 54 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

X-Men: First Class," Excellent
","It isn't often I get to see a film on the first day of release, but due to a timely week off work I was able to make it to the first screening at my local cinema. There was no need to rush, the other eight people there were well spread out and I had an entire row (or six) to myself! I guess I should talk about the film that's why you're reading this after all. Really enjoyable with quite a complicated plot but I found that despite a running time of over two hours it really flew by! Testament to the writers, actors, director and everyone else involved, it's a big thumbs up from me.We are told the story of how Charles Xavier founded his school for mutants in 1963. How he and his best friend, Erik Lehnsherr, later to be known as Magneto, had differing visions for the future for mutants. The stories of Hank McCoy (Beast) and Raven (Mystique), amongst others, are also told, particularly how Raven grew up with Charles but ultimately couldn't see his vision. The narrative is set against the Cuban Missile Crisis, which, for the purposes of this story, is manipulated by one Sebastian Shaw, who has his own reasons for wanting to start a nuclear war. Shaw also has a very strong significance to Erik but I'm not going to tell you about that here (no spoilers here).Great performances all round, particularly from; James McAvoy as Charles Xavier, Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw, Rose Byrne as CIA agent Moira MacTaggert, Jennifer Lawrence as Raven / Mystique and Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy / Beast.As we have come to expect from these films, the special effects are of the highest quality. Fortunately this does not distract from the excellent plot that gives so much more depth to the main characters. There is a fair amount of humour as well, look out for a very brief appearance from Wolverine (very funny). Over all, an exceedingly well made film that I hope becomes a big hit. It's intelligent without ever talking down to the audience and I really enjoyed it. I would be happy to see it again and it's already pencilled in to be added to by DVD collection Recommended.My Score 8.5/10",9,6,10,1 June 2011
Blade Runner," Scotts Finest Hour... (or two)...
","Director: Ridley Scott. Running time: 117 mins (approx). Certification (UK): 15.Genre: Sci-Fi/Drama/Thriller. UK Release date: 9th September 1982. NOTE: This DVD version hails from 1991.Watched on DVD Thursday 17th November 2011.PLEASE NOTE: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.I have spoken to many fans of Science Fiction over the years and the vast majority of them always have something good to say about this film. Now I know there are those among you, mostly deranged people, who might hold a different view, but I am on the side of those who rate this film. I'll even go so far as to say its right up there with the very best sci-fi films (if you ignore the original theatrical cut, which was truly awful). More of my praise after this brief summary.There is an opening scrolling text on this version of the film that explains the set-up better than I ever could, here it is:'Early in the 21st Century, THE TYRELL CORPORATION advanced Robot evolution into the NEXUS phase - a being virtually identical to a human - known as a Replicant. The NEXUS 6 Replicants were superior in strength and agility, and at least equal in intelligence, to the genetic engineers who created them. Replicants were used Off-World as slave labour, in the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny by a NEXUS 6 combat team in an Off-World colony, Replicants were declared illegal on earth - under penalty of death. Special police squads - BLADE RUNNER UNITS - had orders to shoot to kill, upon detection, any trespassing Replicant. This was not called execution. It was called retirement.'Now you've read that I shall continue Four Replicants have jumped ship, killed the crew and the passengers and made it to Earth. They are; Roy Batty, Pris, Leon Kowalski and Zhora. A retired Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, is brought in to hunt down and 'retire' these Replicants. He is first sent to the Tyrell Corporation where he meets Rachael, a Nexus 6 Replicant. At the time she is unaware of the fact, but Dr. Eldon Tyrell assures Deckard that she's 'special'. Leon had murdered another Blade Runner, Holden, and Deckard goes to Leon's apartment where he finds a clue. Little does he know, the replicants are also trying to find someone Someone high up. I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be calling me in for a Voight-Kampff test (again).Visually stunning with a beautiful and atmospheric score by Vangelis, this film has a lot going for it (IMO). Great performances all round; Harrison Ford plays the world-weary Deckard to a tee, Rutger Hauer is excellent as the brutal but fragile Roy Batty and Sean Young plays Rachael with just the right amount of fear. Also worthy of note are; Edward James Olmos as Gaff, M. Emmet Walsh as Bryant, Daryl Hannah as Pris, William Sanderson as J.F. Sebastian, Brion James as Leon, Joe Turkel as Dr. Eldon Tyrell and Joanna Cassidy as Zhora.I have seen this film many times before but this is the first time I realised just how introspective it is. All the action is focused on Deckard and the Replicants without the audience really seeing much outside this group. Yes there are hints; the advertising for the off-world colonies, but apart from that it's very insular. Moving on, I thought the effects were truly stunning, given that there was no CGI back then and the design, the look and the feel of the whole thing is superb. A world is created that the audience could easily imagine Los Angeles 2019 to be like OK, maybe not the flying cop cars, but you know what I mean. Yes, it does tend to drag on a bit towards the end, but I can forgive that for a truly excellent film that, for its day, has never been equalled VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My Score: 9.5/10.IMDb Score: 8.3/10 (based on 223,454 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 92/100 (based on 101 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",10,3,7,17 November 2011
Toy Story 3," Another great film for Pixar!... & even better second time around!
","NOTE: What follows is my original review of the film when I first saw it in July last year (2010). It recently premiered on TV and I felt I should see it again. Fortunately my opinion has not changed, hence the repeat outing for this review. It was good to watch it in the privacy of my own home because I got something in my eye towards the end and there was a handy box of tissues nearby Hope you enjoy the review.-o0o-The toys are back for their third outing. And as the 3D debate rages on I took the high ground and stuck to the supposedly outmoded two dimensions for this one. After all that's exactly the number of dimensions the screen has. But enough of this I hear you say, tell me more about the film.Andy is growing up fast and is on his way to college soon. He has not played with the toys in quite a while and, quite frankly, they're worried. With talk of the attic, and even worse, the trash, even Woody is getting apprehensive. Andy's mum tells him to sort out his room, things for the attic, things to go to college with him and things to go out for the trash. His sister Molly also gets a box to put toys in to donate to the Sunnyside day-care centre (yes I know I used the English spelling, I'm English, what can I say?). By some mix-up all of Andy's toys end up in the donation box, I won't say how because I don't want to spoil it. All seems very pleasant when they arrive. They are greeted by a bear called Lotso who is very nice to them, but all is not what it seems at Sunnyside. I think that's enough of the plot to whet your appetite. You wouldn't forgive me if I gave too much away would you.As we have come to expect from Pixar, this is an exceptionally well made film with a great plot, endearing characters, lots of adventure, comedy and one or two tear-jerking moments along the way. Great work, as ever, from the voice talents of, Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Joan Cusack as Jessie, Ned Beatty as Lotso, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Michael Keaton as Ken, Wallace Shawn as Rex, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head, John Morris as Andy and Jodi Benson as Barbie.There are some great moments, like when Ken met Barbie for the first time, Mr. Potato Head as a tortilla and Buzz Lightyear in Spanish mode has to be seen to be believed! I really enjoyed this film, I really engaged with the characters I know so well for the previous two films and found myself quite choked at the end. All three films have been tremendous and I really hope they don't make a fourth, finish on a high guys! Over all, highly recommended.My score: 8.7/10",9,1,2,24 July 2010
Trainspotting," Brilliant, dark & Recommended!
","This is Danny Boyle's second feature film and I must admit that by the time I'd seen this one I was convinced he was Scottish. Fortunately I know better now. This one's all about drug addiction and the consequences of it. Sounds a drag, but believe me, it's one of the most entertaining films you'll ever see! But more on my thoughts later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please go cold turkey in the back room while I write the next paragraph).Set, for the main part, in Scotland, this film tells the story of Renton and his friends, Spud, Sick Boy, Tommy and Begbie. It tells of their flirtations with heroin and all that brings. How they rip each other off, ruin each other's relationships, get high, get low, get sick, get off the drug, get back on it againÂ… it's all here. Eventually Renton decides to get off it entirely and moves to London, but that is far from the end of it. I'm going to leave it deliberately brief and vague because this is a dish best served without too much prior knowledge my friend.First of all, it's a great script by John Hodge based on the novel by Irvine Welsh; add to that the directorial skill of Danny Boyle and you have a bit of a masterpiece on your hands. There are times where things do get a bit surreal, but I think it all adds to the brilliant execution of this tale. Really great performances all round, particularly from; Ewan McGregor as Renton, Ewen Bremner as Spud, Jonny Lee Miller as Sick Boy, Kevin McKidd as Tommy and Robert Carlyle as the psycho, Begbie.There are scenes in this film that are quite hard to watch but I believe it is all included to show just how real the effects of drug addiction are. There is also a lot of humour in this film which, kind of, plays against the grain in a couple of places, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment too much. Over all, with an iconic soundtrack, some great performances, a tremendous script and some brilliant filmmaking, this one is very, very highly recommended.My score: 9.2/10",9,1,1,9 January 2011
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Great Family Fun!
","I have watched and enjoyed all of the 'Ice Age' movies, they are good family fun. The third instalment is no exception. Very enjoyable from start to finish with plenty of 'laugh out loud' moments.Scrat, the sabre toothed squirrel, has a rival for the acorn he craves so much, a female called Scratte. As they battle for possession of the sacred acorn, to much comic effect I might add, Manny and Ellie are expecting their first child. Diego feels he's losing his edge and decides he wants to leave the herd and Sid is jealous of Ellie and Manny and adopts three seemingly abandoned eggs. Manny tells Sid to take them back but he doesn't and finds three hungry baby dinosaurs the following morning. Sid tries to entertain the youngsters by taking them to the playground Manny built, but the babies only end up scaring all the other children away. The real mother then turns up and, having caused some havoc, takes the babies away, along with Sid. Manny, Ellie, Crash and Eddie all follow and Diego ends up chasing after Sid as well. They find themselves in a mysterious underground world populated by dinosaurs and one crazy weasel called Buck. This is where the fun really starts and this is where I'll leave my little summary. You don't want me to give the entire plot away do you? As I said at the beginning, this is a most enjoyable film with plenty of 'laugh out loud' moments. I counted six (from me) which makes this a really good comedy in my book. Either that or it pressed all of my laughter buttons! Nice performances from the voice talents of, Ray Romano as Manny, Queen Latifah as Ellie, John Leguizamo as Sid, Denis Leary as Diego, Seann William Scott as Crash, Josh Peck as Eddie and Simon Pegg as Buck.Over all, it's a great family adventure with plenty of laughs along the way. As an adult I found the plot a bit simple, but the 'laugh out loud' moments made up for that. So, young or old this one's definitely recommended! My score: 7.3/10",7,1,2,10 May 2010
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Thought provoking & entertaining stuff from Woody Allen
","As both a writer and a director, Woody Allen has made some funny, some thought provoking but always entertaining films. For me, this one falls into the thought provoking category. As with a lot of his films, this is an exploration of how relationships work. But let me tell you something of the plot first.Friends Vicky and Cristina are to spend the summer in Barcelona. The more stable, and engaged, Vicky has arranged that they stay with her aunt Judy and husband Mark. Cristina, who has always been more daring, is just getting over writing and directing a twelve minute film she hated. They go out to see the sights and, after a few days they meet Juan Antonio, an artist, who offers to take them to a small town for the weekend where they can see the sights. He makes it clear his intentions are to get one, or both of them into bed. Cristina, being the more adventurous is keen to go and persuades Vicky to accompany her. After a day of sightseeing Cristina decides she wants to share Juan Antonio's bed. Unfortunately she becomes ill right at the critical moment and ends up bedridden for the rest of the weekend. This leaves Vicky and Juan Antonio alone together. One thing leads to another and they end up in each others arms. When they return to Barcelona Juan Antonio calls Cristina up and they go out together. After a few weeks, Cristina moves in with Juan Antonio. And then Juan Antonio's estranged wife, Maria Elena turns up. Throw in Vicky's husband to be turning up and proposing they marry in Spain and you've got a pretty well mixed up Woody Allen plot. There is more, but, as ever I won't give the ending away.This is a very well made film with dialogue that is unmistakably written by Woody Allen. I do question some of the morality, but then again, Juan Antonio did make his intentions clear from the beginning. Very good performances from all of the major players, Rebecca Hall as Vicky, Scarlett Johansson as Cristina, Javier Bardem as Juan Antonio and Penélope Cruz as Maria Elena.Although it's not the kind of film I'd usually go out of my way to watch I did enjoy a lot of the dialogue and the way the film explores the neuroses of relationships. It's pretty entertaining, especially whenever Maria Elena appears on the screen! Over all, recommended, but turn your moral compass off first.My Score: 6.9/10",7,1,3,17 May 2010
The Deer Hunter," Compelling drama with De Niro, Walken, Savage & Streep...
","I have tried to watch this film a few in the past, but always failed to understand it. This time I cleared FOUR HOURS, taking into account all the little things that distract the viewer at home, and this time I actually got to the end and had some kind of a grip on what it was all about. Here are a couple of sentences about the film before I give you my thoughts.This is a film of five acts; I've called them Home, Hunting, Nam, Home Again and Nam Again. Others may divide it up differently, but that's how I see it. The story revolves around three guys; Michael, Steven and Nick, from a Pennsylvania steel town who go off to the Vietnam war full of hope and bravado. It deals with what happens to them there and the effects it has on both them and their loved ones back home. I won't go into specifics, but the effects of their experiences resonate deeply into the community they came from. I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will force me to play roulette with some Vietnamese gentlemen.First of all, great music throughout, not least the main theme performed by classical guitarist, John Williams. Also the film was beautifully shot by Director of Photography, Vilmos Zsigmond. Great performances all round, particularly from; Robert De Niro as Michael, Christopher Walken as Nick and John Savage as Steven. These three really carried off quite a performance! They were ably backed up by; John Cazale as Stan, Meryl Streep as Linda, George Dzundza as John and Chuck Aspegren as Axel.Putting aside the great performances, the cinematography and the music for a moment, I have to take a second to comment on the length of the piece. It is far too long; the first two acts take up nearly half the running time and do nothing to further the story that couldn't be done in thirty to forty minutes. The sequence in Vietnam could have been expanded, for instance, there is nothing that tells us just how they ended up in the situation they did (no spoilers I'm afraid). The later acts could have been dramatically shortened also. So I reckon about an hour could have been cut from this film and it would have been just as good, if not better. I am going to give it quite a decent score despite these misgivings because it is still a very powerful drama that I actually found quite compelling at times Recommended (with reservations).My Score: 7.5/10.IMDb Score: 8.2/10 (based on 104,871 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 91/100 (based on 45 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",8,0,1,18 September 2011
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Love the animation...
","Over the years many tales by Roald Dahl have been adapted for the screen, both for TV and for the big screen. This is the latest big-screen adaptation of one of his works. For me, while it was quite an engaging tale I felt it wasn't made for an audience outside the United States. This is not a criticism, it just seemed to me that it had all become a little too 'Americanised' (if that's a word). The stop-motion animation, the sets and everything technical about it was very well done but I felt the characters had lost the mystique they had when I read this as a youngster. I will always now hear George Clooney as Mr. Fox and to me that's all wrong (I explain why later). Here's a very brief summary of the plot, and then some more of my thoughts.Mr. Fox loves to steal chickens, ducks, anything he can eat or drink really. Unfortunately this is a dangerous business and his wife persuades him to find a safer occupation when she falls pregnant. So he takes up writing for a local newspaper. Several years later he decides it's time they moved and so they go to live in the trunk of a tree. This affords him a great view of three local farms, owned by Franklin Bean, Walter Boggis and Nathan Bunce. Unable to resist the temptation he enlists the help of Kylie Sven Opossum and raids all three farms. The farmers aren't going to take this lying down and Mr. Fox and his family, and in fact the whole community, find themselves trapped. Can Mr. Fox find a cunning way to save the day? As usual, my contract with the Spoiler Police prevents me telling you here.I love the animation of this film, I always think stop-motion gives a very unique look and it works really well here. Although I have a slight dislike for the accents, to me Mr. Fox should be a very devious upper class English accent, but hey, you can't always get what you want as the Rolling Stones once said. Anyhow, a decent effort from the voice talents of; George Clooney as Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox, Bill Murray as Badger, Michael Gambon as Franklin Bean and even Jarvis Cocker who gave us a song as Petey.So, in conclusion, visually, it's a treat, I love the look and feel of the film. Plot wise, well it's based on a Roald Dhal story so you can't go too far wrong there. I liked the choice of music in the film, a couple of Beach Boys numbers were very welcome. I think if it wasn't for the voices I would have enjoyed it more, but it's worth seeing for the animation.My Score: 6.9/10",7,0,2,5 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A fitting end to the franchise...
","Wishing to avoid the crowds I decided to wait a week before going to see this and, although it was showing in the smaller of my local cinema's two screening rooms, it was still quite busy. I was surprised to find a good friend of mine there with his son and so I joined them on the front row (not a spot I'd usually choose, but I was surprised by the effect). Having already read the book after seeing 'HP7: Part 1' last year I knew we were in for a bit of a treat. Here's a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts.Harry, Hermione and Ron are still on the trail of Lord Voldemort's three remaining Horcruxes. To this end they convince Griphook to take them to Greengots to retrieve one from the vault of Bellatrix Lestrange. They manage to obtain it, but are discovered and have to escape by releasing the creature guarding the vaults. Voldermort knows they have the Horcrux but they press on. Harry has a feeling the next one is back at Hogwarts and so, risking everything, they return to the school. Severus Snape has been made headmaster and he rules the school with tight discipline. Neville Longbottom and many of the other pupils have started an underground resistance group and it is these who welcome the trio back to the school. Having removed Snape, they now have to find the remaining Horcruxes and the means to destroy them. It is a race against time because Voldemort's forces are gathering outside and they mean to kill Harry Potter. I think that's about all I can say without them Death Eater Spoiler Police coming after me.The story follows on (not surprisingly) directly from Part 1; there is no 'the story so far' bit at the beginning so if you haven't seen Part 1 then it may all be a bit confusing. As far as performances go, they all did a great job; Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. Special praise goes to Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort and Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape, I though both were excellent in their difficult roles. Also worthy of a mention were; Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Michael Gambon as Professor Albus Dumbledore, Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood and finally, Warwick Davis as Griphook / Professor Filius Flitwick.There are some significant differences from the book, most of which are there to make the story flow better on screen. The only bit I was disappointed about was towards the end where Harry has a particularly stirring speech in the book; this was sadly missing from the film. On a technical level, I cannot fault it, the CGI and effects are all excellent, although much of the time it is very dark (I wouldn't have liked to see it in 3D). Over all an excellent, and fitting, end to the franchise and one I'm happy to very highly recommend to you.My score: 9.2/10 IMDb Score: 8.4/10 (68,140 votes when this review was written).

Easy A," A lot better than expected!... I'll even go so far as to say I liked it!... a bit...
","As some of you may know, I'm not big on comedies. It may be because I have a peculiar sense of humour, but, for the most part, what Hollywood thinks is funny is usually antipodean to my opinion (bet you're looking up what 'antipodean' means now). I'll still keep trying them out form time to time though you never know, there just might be someone out there in 'La La land' on the same wavelength as me! And so we come to 'Easy A'; a teen comedy (not encouraging so far), all about a girl of (alleged) easy virtue (still not encouraging, but hey, I've come this far). Well, despite many misgivings, I must say it wasn't half as bad as I thought it might be (& that's high praise from me! for a comedy). Now, since I've been accused of giving too much away in my plot summaries, I will just give you the very briefest outline of what it's about (you'll probably get more from the trailer than I usually give away but, (sigh), if I'm getting complaints I guess I'd better pare it down a tad or 12).Olive Penderghast is at high school and she lies to her friend, Rhiannon, about sleeping with a boy (for reasons I won't go into). As they do, rumours spread like wildfire, and before she knows it, Olive finds herself with an unwanted reputation. The question is what is she going to do about it?... So there you go, the new and improved 'outline' Hope you liked it and I didn't spoil the entire movie for you If I did then you have my profound apologies.I said earlier that I didn't find this film too bad, well, I might even go so far as to say I actually enjoyed parts of it quite a bit! I thought Patricia Clarkson as Rosemary (Olive's mother) and Stanley Tucci as Dill (her dad) provided a great comic foil for her character. Her favourite teacher, Mr Griffith, played by Thomas Haden Church, and his wife, played by Lisa Kudrow, also added another dimension to the piece. Of course, it was Emma Stone, as Olive, that held the whole thing together, and I thought she put in an excellent performance. Honourable mentions go to; Malcolm McDowell as Principal Gibbons, Penn Badgley as Woodchuck Todd, Amanda Bynes as Marianne, Dan Byrd as Brandon and Aly Michalka as Rhiannon.A witty script with some great dialogue made a welcome change from many recent (so called) comedy efforts I've seen spewed out of 'tinsel town' in recent years. It also has a pretty good soundtrack with some tunes even I recognised! There is a minor problem with it though The way Olive chooses to deal with her problem is dragged on a bit too long and after a while it gets a bit monotonous. Fortunately it picks up though and it got saved from a lower score by a rather cool ending (sorry no clues). Over all, although not perfect, I found this a witty, pretty well written and entertaining comedy Recommended.My Score: 7.1/10.IMDb Score: 7.1/10 (based on 61,651 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 86/100 (based on 174 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",7,0,1,22 October 2011
Fast Five," A return to form for the 'Fast & Furious' franchise
","Very well shot with some truly spectacular driving stunts and special effects; the driving in this film is really excellent; hats off to all those involved in the stunt work! As for performances, well everybody did a decent job; Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto and Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, reprising roles from previous instalments were just as good as they were in the first film. Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto did a decent job, as did Dwayne Johnson as the no-nonsense cop, Luke Hobbs. Also worthy of note were; Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce, Ludicrous as Tej Parker, Matt Schulze as Vince and Joaquim de Almeida as Hernen Reyes.You'd have thought a film about big men driving fast cars wouldn't be all that appealing, but this one does have a bit of something about it. No, it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it is entertaining in its own way and I can't knock it for that. The stunt work is excellent and the plot isn't all that bad as either. It does, however, require some knowledge of at least some of the previous films involving the main characters though. It works quite well as a caper/heist movie with a bit of an edge to it, although I did find a little too much time was spent with the 'good guys'. The city of Rio features very prominently and, for me, was also a bit of a star of the show. Over all, although it's not a great film, it's an entertaining film and one I have no problem in deeming Recommended.My Score: 7.2/10 IMDb Score: 7.3/10 (based on 105,098 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 78/100 (based on 180 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 83/100 (based on 104,318 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,1,3,17 March 2012
Gangs of New York," Not perfect, but still recommended...
","This film has been lurking in my DVD collection for some time now. The trouble is, it's hard to find the nigh on three hours required to watch this epic. Fortunately, having been ordered to take my holidays, or lose them, a day off provided the necessary time-slot. It's a movie with tremendous scope that shows a side of New York history I wasn't aware of. Although not perfect, it still has a lot going for it. But more of that later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please assume the crash position for the next paragraph).We begin in 1846 at the Five Points, a district of New York notorious for its poverty and for its gangs. A clash between two gangs, the 'Native Americans', predominantly white, who were born there and the 'Dead Rabbits', predominantly Irish immigrants, leaves the leader of the 'Dead Rabbits', 'Priest' Vallon, dead. His killer, leader of the other gang, Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting shows mercy on his young son and sends him away. Sixteen years later the son, Amsterdam Vallon, returns to the Five Points seeking revenge, but prepared to bide his time. He decides to get close to Cutting and manages to do so with some great cunning. He meets Jenny Everdeane and falls for her, but she is indebted to Cutting and so Amsterdam, at first, spurns her, but we all know that isn't going to last. This is all told against the backdrop of the American Civil War and President Lincoln's plans to bring in a draft on the citizens of New York. There is a lot of feeling about this and the citizens are getting restless. Also, a politician, William 'Boss' Tweed is always trying to buy the votes of the residents of the Five Points by siding with Cutting on certain matters, a situation that doesn't go down to well with certain factions. Now, having infiltrated Cutting's inner circle, it's time for Amsterdam to strike and it's here I'll leave my short summary what? You didn't really expect me to give the ending away did you?... Shame.This is a beautifully made film; everything from the cinematography to the set design to the costumes is all really well done. Some great performances too, especially from Daniel Day-Lewis, as Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting, it is a pleasure to watch every scene he is in. Also praiseworthy are; Leonardo DiCaprio as Amsterdam Vallon and Cameron Diaz as Jenny Everdeane. Honourable mentions also go to; Jim Broadbent as William 'Boss' Tweed, John C. Reilly as Happy Jack Mulraney and Henry Thomas as Johnny Sirocco.I was afraid at first that this was going to be just another of those damned 'America loves everything Irish' kind of movies, which I totally despise! Fortunately Scorsese knows better than that and what we get is a more balanced view of things (for a change). The film is a little too long for my liking and I found it quite easy to draw parallels with the likes of 'Goodfellas' and 'Once Upon A Time in America', but I can forgive that. It is enthralling throughout and a great visual spectacle, if just for the height of the top hats and Daniel Day-Lewis's moustache and trousers! They are tremendous! Over all, if you can make the time Highly recommended.My score: 7.6/10",8,1,1,18 November 2010
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," I'm on the side of the critics with this one (I'm afraid)...
","The opening sequence of the film is very well done (IMO); it sets up the story very well and leaves enough mystery to keep the audience guessing. Unfortunately the film cannot sustain this level for long and pretty soon we're back to the usual 'big robots hitting each other in the streets of America' scenario that (personally) I've seen enough of.On the plus side, there were some nice comic moments mainly provided by John Turturro and Alan Tudyk. I will also give a nod to the guys that did the CGI, it's all top-notch stuff and some of it is quite spectacular. On the downside I found many of the human characters irritating, in particular Sam Witwicky. He comes over as a bit of a petulant kid when he doesn't get the job he wants. Carly; well I guess she was just there to show off her curves, but as we all know, Michael Bay likes curves. I guess the whole franchise doesn't quite work for me because the filmmakers are so insistent on putting human traits on alien beings. Every robot, whether it be Autobot or Decepticon has to have a character and most of the time and in a lot of cases, it just makes them look stupid. Over all, not one I'll be watching again but I guess there will be a lot of fifteen year old boys out there that'll love it!...

The Social Network," A great film!...
","I remember when this came out there was an awful lot of debate, praise and general talking about it. Unfortunately it never made it to my local cinema (surprisingly), but it finally made it to a pay TV channel this week. I was quite keen to see it given the amount of attention it got, and also because it was written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher, both of which I admire greatly. Here's a little about the plot before I give you my thoughts.After a disagreement with a girl, Erica Albright, computer genius Mark Zuckerberg goes online and writes a program called 'Facemash'. It was available only to students at Harvard University, where he was studying. It caused quite a stir when the University servers crashed. He had the help of his friend, Eduardo Saverin, who would eventually be credited as a co-founder of Facebook. Moving on from this, Mark is approached by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and their associate Divya Narendra, to write a web site for them that had elements common with what Facebook would become. Instead of working on their site, Mark works on his own idea, with backing from Eduardo. Eventually 'The Facebook' goes live at Harvard University and is an instant hit. They expand to other Universities in the United States and eventually across the world. Mark is contacted by Sean Parker, the inventor of Napster, and he eventually moves out to California to use his expertise. All this time, Eduardo is being squeezed out of the business. It all comes to a head when Mark is sued by Eduardo, the Winklevoss twins and Divya Narendra. It is this action that forms the central part of the movie and it is from here the various parts of the story are told in flashback. I've probably said too much, but the film is about so much more so I'll stop before the Spoiler Police (Universities branch) escort me off campus.As you'd expect from Aaron Sorkin, an excellent script with some really great dialogue! The film is beautifully made, expertly paced and I found it very easy to get into. Great performances all round, particularly from Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, a real departure for him and he pulled it off brilliantly. I must also give praise to Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, for me, he put in the best performance, maybe because his character was more likable, but still a great performance. Honourable mentions go to; Armie Hammer as Cameron Winklevoss / Tyler Winklevoss and Max Minghella as Divya Narendra.I really enjoyed this film, the subject matter is one that's close to many people's hearts and so I guess it was bound to be a hit. I did find the picture very dark though; so much so that curtains had to be drawn (it was a daytime viewing). I think it's one of those films that will eventually become a classic, but it is one you have to watch It's very easy to get lost in the twists and turns of a piece of dialogue written by Aaron Sorkin. (I mean that in a nice way). Over all, beautifully made, a great script, an enthralling story and some great performances Recommended.My Score: 8.5/10.IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 149,604 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 96/100 (based on 272 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",9,1,2,11 September 2011
Beetlejuice," A little dated today, but sound stuff from Tim Burton...
","I know this is a pretty old film, but believe it or not, I had never seen it before. It's one of those that somehow managed to escape me. I've seen bits and pieces of it when it's been on TV, but this is the first time I've sat down and watched it all the way through. I'll admit to being a bit of a fan of Tim Burton's work over the years and so I was keen to have a look at this one.Adam and Barbara Maitland Live in a beautiful country house that they have decorated themselves. When they die in an accident they return to the house as ghosts. To their horror, the house is bought by a couple from New York, Charles and Delia Deetz, who move in with Charles' daughter Lydia. Delia considers herself an artist and, with the help of her friend Otho, proceeds to re-model the house. The Maitland's are now really distressed, what with coming to terms with being dead as well, it's all proving a bit much. Lydia can see the ghosts and, after talking for a while, the Maitland's take a liking to her. Help is at hand in the guise of the crazy spirit known as Beetlejuice. But the Maitland's, at first try to scare the Deetz family away themselves. This all goes wrong when they are enthralled by their efforts and want more! Can Beetlejuice save the day? Guess you'll have to watch it to find out.Although it looks quite dated by today's standards, this is unmistakably a Tim Burton film. A lot of stop-motion animation is used for the special effects which reminded me of the much later Corpse Bride from 2005. Decent performances from all of the main cast, Alec Baldwin as Adam Maitland, Geena Davis as Barbara Maitland, Catherine O'Hara as Delia Deetz, Jeffrey Jones as Charles Deetz, Winona Ryder as Lydia Deetz and Glenn Shadix as Otho. And, of course, a special mention for Michael Keaton who was great as the mad-cap Beetlejuice.A pretty entertaining film with some nice touches. It looks a little dated now but it still works. It has the unmistakable mark of Tim Burton and will always be synonymous with Michael Keaton's portrayal of the over-the-top Beetlejuice. Over all, good stuff, if a little dated: Recommended.My score: 6.4/10",6,1,4,31 May 2010
The Soloist," Sorry... disappointing...
","I heard quite a few things about this film before seeing it, not all of it was good. Now I've watched it I can see why. It's based on a true story from a book written by journalist Steve Lopez who is portrayed in the film by Robert Downey Jr. He has a column on the L.A. Times where he writes about characters he meets on the streets.Out cycling one day, journalist Steve Lopez comes off his bicycle and ends up in hospital. Whilst recovering from his injuries he hears a violin being played. He eventually finds a down-and-out man playing a two-string violin. They get talking and the man, Nathaniel Ayers, tells him he went to Julliard, which is at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. Lopez checks up on Nathaniel's story and discovers that he started there, but never graduated, his speciality was the cello. It is clear to Steve that Nathaniel is a schizophrenic, but he refuses to accept any help. After writing his first article, a reader sends Steve an old cello that she can no longer play due to rheumatism. Steve takes it to Nathaniel but tells him he cannot keep it on the street, instead he can play it at the LAMP homeless shelter. Allowing Nathaniel to play it one time in the street, Steve is really moved and realises just how good a musician he is and how much he loves to play. The film then goes on to tell us more about the backgrounds of both Nathaniel and Steve and how a friendship grows between them. How Nathaniel developed his love for music and how his schizophrenia affected his career. We also learn about the past relationship Steve had with his boss, Mary Weston. But I'll end my short synopsis here, don't want to give too much away.As you can probably tell from my short synopsis not a lot really happens in this film, and that's the problem with it. I found it very hard to gain any empathy for any of the characters and so, to me, it all felt a bit flat. The performances from both Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Ayers and Robert Downey Jr. as Steve Lopez were fine, but the material just didn't work. I should also give honourable mentions to; Catherine Keener as Mary Weston, Tom Hollander as Graham Claydon, Lisa Gay Hamilton as Jennifer Ayers and Nelsan Ellis as David Carter.Over all this was quite a disappointment, I thought it would have been better than it was. The cinematography was fine, the performances were fine but it was all let down by a rather poorly put together script (IMO). So I'm afraid this was not a film for me and I can't really recommend it to you.My score: 5.3/10",5,1,1,4 September 2010
The Fighter," A great film with some great performances Highly Recommended!
","Since several friends of mine have recommended this movie, and since one of them even lent me the DVD, I thought I'd better give it a look. Well, it makes a nice change to say they were correct on this occasion, it's a tremendous film! I really enjoyed it and have no problem in recommending it (yes, I liked it that much I'll recommend it in the first paragraph). I'll tell you why after this brief summary.Micky Ward is a boxer, not a very successful one when we meet him, but a boxer nonetheless. His half-brother, Dicky Eklund, on the other hand, once had a fight for the world title against Sugar Ray Leonard. As we begin, Dicky is supposed to be training Micky, but he's late he's always late. A film crew are making a documentary about Dicky, a documentary about the effects of crack addiction. Yes, Dicky has a habit and yet none of his family is prepared to do anything about it. His mother, Alice, who runs the family with an iron fist, refuses to recognise it, as does her husband, George Ward and his many sisters (too many to mention). Micky meets a girl, Charlene Fleming and they start to see each other, she is strong-willed, just like his mother, and you can see conflict coming. When Dicky gets locked up Charlene persuades Micky to go with a different manager and trainer. It pays off and Micky gets on the road to success but how will his family react? I'll leave it there because I don't want the Spoiler Police breaking my fingers.The plot of this film is a great family drama, and what makes it better is that it's based on a true story. The critics were all over Christian Bale's performance and he did indeed walk away with the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund. Also worthy of note was Melissa Leo who also won the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role for her take on the domineering mother, Alice Ward. Personally, I was surprised that Mark Wahlberg didn't even get a nomination for his role of Micky Ward and I have to also give a mention to Amy Adams as Charlene Fleming, who I thought was also great.I find that sometimes films based on true stories tend to over-dramatise events and in doing so lose the essence of the story. I don't think that is true in this case, they are very much 'larger than life' characters and that's just how they are portrayed. I did find it ironic though that 'Irish' Micky Ward had to fight an Irishman for one of his big fights. I noticed the filmmakers made him a not very nice Irishman though. But enough of that, I found the film very uplifting and quite inspiring. As I said at the beginning, I have no problem in recommending this one If you haven't seen it, please do, it's well worth the time.My Score: 9.2/10 IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 77,231 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 91/100 (based on 225 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",Null,0,0,2 October 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," Who's the good guy here?
","The ending of this was slightly spoilt by overhearing the closing moments during one of many conversations about films in my local pub. Fortunately, the discussion didn't involve exactly how this conclusion was reached and so the film wasn't a total loss. An interesting film which raises several questions about justice, but one that also has its flaws. I'll give you my thoughts after this brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please prosecute that murderer, and do it right this time, while I write the next paragraph).After seeing his wife and daughter murdered in front of him, Clyde Shelton is justifiably aggrieved at the justice system. One of the assailants, Clarence Darby, agrees to give evidence against his accomplice for a reduced sentence. Darby is the one responsible for the murders and Shelton believes he's the one that should pay the heaviest price. When, subsequently, Darby is found brutally murdered, Shelton is arrested. The prosecutor, Nick Rice, stands by the original action against Darby, believing it was the only way he could have obtained a conviction. Shelton sees it differently and has his own brand of justice in mind, not just against the perpetrators of the crime against his family, but against the whole justice system. I'll leave my summary here so as not to vex Shelton or indeed the Spoiler Police.Decent performances all round, although I feel nobody was really stretched. Gerard Butler was brooding as Clyde Shelton; Jamie Foxx was stylish and sometimes angry as Nick Rice. Nice to see Colm Meaney as Detective Dunnigan and Bruce McGill as the DA, Jonas Cantrell. An honourable mention also goes to Leslie Bibb as Sarah Lowell.This film gave me a bit of a dilemma; I couldn't decide quite who the good guy was. On one hand there's Shelton whose life has been turned upside down and who you can easily sympathise with at the beginning of the film. The trouble is, when his retribution starts to go a little too far, you're left with Rice to root for. The trouble with Rice is that it was his ambition to get one more easy conviction that caused all of what followed. I'm still on the fence with this one I'm afraid.Technically, the film is well made with some great shots of Philadelphia and some nice action sequences. I liked the sound mix on the DVD, it's nice when they bother to utilise all of the 5.1 Dolby speakers. Although the film isn't great, it just has enough to keep the audience occupied (if only trying to figure out who the good guy is). I might watch it again, but it would have to be in a while, when I need reminding that Gerard Butler doesn't just do really poor comedies Not really recommended, but if you feel compelled, go for it.My Score: 5.4/10",5,1,2,22 April 2011
Up in the Air," Excellent stuff... Clooney is very good indeed!...
","I remember this film being critically acclaimed earlier this year, even winning some important nominations and picking up one or two awards. I hadn't realised that the director, Jason Reitman, also directed Juno, a favourite of mine from 2007. With all these coincidences, I had to give it a viewing when it came up on TV. I wasn't disappointed, it's pretty good but more of that later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please wait in the VIP Executive Lounge while I write the next paragraph).Ryan Bingham has a job that means he is on the road a lot, well, when I say 'on the road' I mean up in the air, of course. He spends most of the year travelling from place to place terminating people's employment. Not the nicest job, I know, but one that he is very competent at. On the side, he also gives motivational lectures. During one of his trips he meets Alex Goran, an attractive woman who also has a job that entails a lot of air travel. Having compared notes, they get together and find there is some attraction there. Later, Ryan is called into the office and is told that the company he works for is looking at taking everyone off the road and replacing them with an impersonal internet-linked screen. He argues against it and ends up taking the inventor of the system, Natalie Keener, on the road so she can experience exactly how it works. The pair don't exactly hit it off at first, but soon develop a respect for each other. Ryan and Alex meet at various places across America and eventually Ryan asks her to accompany him to his sister's wedding. Will she go, and, more importantly, will this bring them closer? Well, I'm not going to tell you here I'm afraid, can't give too much away.This is a really well made gentle comedy that I found both endearing and quite engrossing to watch. All three of the main characters were very good, but I must pick out George Clooney, as Ryan Bingham, for particular praise. I thought he fitted the role perfectly! Vera Farmiga as Alex Goran and Anna Kendrick as Natalie Keener were also both excellent.I really enjoyed this film, it made a nice change to see a modern film with characters that are so easy to relate to. I love the style that Jason Reitman uses; I find it quite relaxing with some great visuals and a tremendous script. Over all, it's one I will watch again and so, definitely recommended.My score: 8.4/10",8,0,2,28 December 2010
