Black Swan," Simply Awesome
","I am not someone who is very fond of writing reviews but if I don't write something about this movie, it would be nothing less than sacrilege. A master piece like Black Swan deserves all the praise in the world. I have enjoyed watching other movies also from director Darren Aronofsky but Black Swan is a notch higher than the rest. He has clearly outperformed himself. Credit is also due to him for his cast selection. Natalie Portman was the perfect choice for this role which she carried off flawlessly. The metamorphosis of her character has been described beautifully. It seems like she were a picture, the director a painter and with every brush stroke the picture radiates darker and darker hues. The whole experience of watching this movie is so intense that it lingers on in your mind much beyond those 2 hours.",9,3,5,5 March 2011
