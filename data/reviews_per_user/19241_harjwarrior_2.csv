The Expendables 2," Im back
",LOL here we go again sly Stallone the legend has just done it again in this solid action movie man this guys a grandad and still looks like hes 16 LOL i have always been a big fan of Sly Stallone from rocky to rambo what classics. This movie has just an amazing dream cast of actors its still so amazing to watch these mega super stars on screen together fighting the baddies. Its very similar to the first expendables its got a nice theme to it with solid action sequences with a good story as well. I especially like the acting of Sly the legend Arnie the king and stratham the kick ass tough guy and don't forget LOL tight pants wearing jean claude van damme i love this guys fight scenes from day one he in my eyes is an amazing martial artist he just makes me wanna put on my boxing gloves and fight even though hes a baddies in this film any ways classic movie i wish to god they made this film 15 20 years ago in there peak but hey at least our dream has come true now yes Thank you and please put Tony Jaa in the next expendables hes the next Bruce Lee yeah,Null,0,0,27 October 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Solid special effects
","OK so spider man 1 was such an amazing solid movie with good script and effects. Spider man 2 was so solid in effects and story line. I love the bit when the bully in the canteen try to fight him, peter parker the geek in glasses beats him up that was so kool and touching it makes you feel like fighting back in any situation. Spider man 3 what can i say he fights a black baddie spider man which also has some really decent fight scenes so far so good. Then amazing spider man i gotta say i liked the spider man 2 peter parker he actually looked good in that role, but peter parker in spider man 3 was still very effective with some really nice touches to the movie and i like the fight scenes against the bad guy lizard monster the effects were really good so over all just watch this amazing movie just like you watch the other spider man movies because you will enjoy this if you love super heroes dreams can come true LOL thanks",10,3,7,27 October 2013
