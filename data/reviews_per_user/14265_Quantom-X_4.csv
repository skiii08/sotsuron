Hereditary," Not my thing, but great for what it is.
","Honestly, this type of movie just isn't my cup of tea. I don't mind a suspense thriller here and there, and I do like a few horror films. When it's packed on constantly as hard as this film does it just bogs me down. I'm also really not too comfortable with all the satanic stuff that films like this have, but that's just me.That being said, this film actually did a really good job at what it was doing. I found myself following along and staying with it regardless. It was well written and the acting was good for the most part. Some of the scenes with the child actors weren't so great, but mostly it was good. I don't really have much bad to say about other than the story itself and the ending are really not stuff I like. But it was done so good that I have to give it a higher rating at least.",7,1,2,5 October 2018
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Really underrated.
","I feel this movie gets a lot more hate than it deserves. Sure it may not be as good as the second one, and let's face it it's hard to top T2. But that doesn't make this a bad film. I actually like how John Connor is portrayed in this. Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",8,69,76,3 October 2018
The Disaster Artist," New appreciation
","After seeing a preview for this film, I didn't realise what it was. But then an interview on YouTube caught my eye where James Franco and Tommy Wiseau were on a couch with Dave Franco and talking to a host. That's when I realised this movie was about the making of The Room. I decided to rent it and give it a watch and it was good!
Funny, and a deep look at the interaction of friends and one crazy guy.I've actually never seen The Room, but after watching this I do want to now. I have a new appreciation for moves so-bad-their-good. I felt James did an excellent job recreating Tommy's persona and mannerisms. I really enjoyed this film and must buy it some time.",9,1,2,5 October 2018
Incredibles 2," Worth the wait
","It's been a long wait. 14 years since the first film and at long last we get the continuation of the story. This movie picks up right where the first one left off. Supers are back in the light and the public opinion is mixed as always with the law not taking too kindly to the Incredibles' efforts.
Honestly with how the movie goes, I can see that their really wasn't much else they could do with the story or where to take it and it still feel like Incredibles and carry the same spirit as the first film. It could easily have just become just another super hero movie with the family stopping some big threat or some other. They went deeper with this story and kept the similar tone of the first, and it works wonderfully. It may be more of nostalgia talking, but the first film still seems to hold up better. Then again I've only seen the sequel once in theaters so far. I was not disappointed and think the movie was wonderful.
Just hopefully we won't have to wait another 14 years for part 3... if we ever get a part 3.Also. Whats up with the girl Evelyn looking almost identical to Roxanne in Megamind?",9,12,20,3 October 2018
