The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Dreamlike sepia tones
","I saw this film about 14 years ago. I saw it again recently and it still has a power about it. It contains some extremely beautiful imagery. My favourite scene is the brief moment when Weronika throws her ball at the ceiling and all the dust falls down on her face as she stays still for a moment. Simple and stunning. It is not my favourite Kieslowski, I would reserve that place for Blue and then No End and the Dekalog series but it has a lovely quality to it. I have never liked the ending really but enjoy the way it comes about. The general concept it strong and it is this that gives the film a slightly haunted quality which it pulls off. Jacob is amazing to watch and the story seems woven as a dream. It is a forerunner for his masterpiece to follow and even a moderately good Kieslowski film trounces most others.",6,6,9,7 June 2008
Juno," Brilliantly funny
","I cannot believe the amount of people that dislike this film. I don't think it was totally original, very few films are, but I do think the dialogue was superb. It sparkled. Some of the lines were brilliantly funny. The two leads were perfectly cast and the chemistry was very strong. I loved the use of the music, always nice to hear something original. I read a comment here that said they obviously could not get clearance for proper music. You must have seen a different film to the one I saw. There were some very touching scenes and I felt that the characters were well rounded. It's the sort of film that you could easily pass by but for me worked on every level. Touching, without being sentimental, very funny, well acted and not over long. Great comedy.",8,1,3,13 July 2008
It's a Wonderful Life," Wish I had a million dollars. Hot dawg!
","At the heart of this marvellous Capra film is a man, who from when we first see him in Gower's store, longs to see far off places. As we all know, he never does leave Bedford Falls and it is this sadness that is at the core of the film and the main character George Bailey, a man with unfulfilled dreams. It is also what makes this film stand the test of time. The characters are believable and compared to current Hollywood heroes win hands down. They are all so well defined and fleshed out as in a Dickens novel that one enjoys spending time with them. So much has been borrowed from this film and so much written about it. Essentially it is James Stewart's central performance that is outstanding and to watch his realistic gradual breakdown is very distressing. I always find it difficult watching the scene when he goes home after realising he cannot find the money and Mary(his wife) turns to see him clutching his daughter with such a desperate look on his face. Her reaction to him is extremely moving. A man driven to the brink worth more alive than dead, this is a much darker film than people often expect. But he does get a second chance and maybe this is why we like it so much, because in real life this is rarely possible. George Bailey played by James Stewart is someone who has a great face. I like George Bailey.",Null,5,10,14 February 2003
The Thin Red Line," Stunning film
","This is a haunting picture with images that appear to me now and then, a reminder of the beauty of the film amidst the dark backdrop of war. It presents the idea that we are inextricably drawn to war as a race on this planet. The beauty of nature that surrounds us must ultimately become destroyed through our action, our own greed. It's a bleak picture with glimpses of what could have been for one of the characters. His vision that there is another world, a better world is mocked by Penn's character throughout. This idea is raised I think about three times between the two characters and in the final scene you almost think Penn is starting to believe his friend who seems at peace with himself. Sure enough however it is Penn who visits his friend's grave, and is left to mourn alone. Is it better to be the victor or the vanquished? Neither is the answer here. We kill a part of ourselves with the hate and anger that we allow to drive us to war. So not a happy film. The final shot seems to offer hope of nature's resolve, of it's ability to rise above mankind and after we are all long gone it will still be here in its infinite glory. The music by Hans Zimmer is superb and the piece 'Journey to the Line' is a sound I find so stirring it moves me to the very core. This was worth the wait.",9,0,1,15 March 2009
The Birds," Sound effects genius behind the film
","I have read quite a few comments mentioning the lack of music in the film so I feel I should make this point. The unsung hero of the film is a German composer called Oskar Sala who worked to compose the electronic score for the film.(see The Dark Side of Genius by Donald Spoto) Hitchcock did not want any music but if you actually listen to the birds themselves their sound is electronic. Sala is now an elderly man of about 90 but is still working occasionally. I was greatly honoured when he composed the score to my short film 'The Box' this year. He is a musical pioneer who developed an instrument called the trautonium. He has worked mostly out of the limelight and the mainstream most of his life but is an inspiration to a lot of musicians. I think the film is extremely powerful because of the lack of music but the birdsound is equally disturbing. It is a simple story that could be handled very loosely in the wrong hands. With some great set pieces and a sense of foreboding, in the hands of Hitchcock it is unforgettable.",6,1,1,24 June 2001
