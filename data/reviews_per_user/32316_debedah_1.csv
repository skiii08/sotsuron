The Ring," Scary... Kind-of
","The Ring is a fairly frightening bit of Hollywood celluloid.  It definately scored quite a bit of style points.  It was interesting to watch.. to see. The acting was good.  The mother did a great job, but I have to admit that her son in the film was teetering dangerously close to the 6th Sense school of child manipulation.  The story could have been much more scary if it didn't have you trying to follow the plotline.  It left me with many questions...  then watching the added features clouded things more... for those who have seen it... do you think that Mr. Morgan put the girl in the loft because he really resented her?  Just before he runs some current through his bathtub with him in it, he says 'she (his wife) wasn't supposed to be able to get pregnant'.  But in the movie, it comes out from the Dr. that they just came back with the girl, and no one knows where she came from.  I'm thinking that he resented her because 'he' wasn't responsible for her creation, and it was 'him' that wasn't supposed to provide the juice to bear children.  Leading me to believe that the wife cheated... thus explaining how much Mr. Morgan hated and resented the child.  This is the main stumbling block for me.  Otherwise I enjoyed being scared.  Some of the scenes were exceptionally well done.  It left me with a lot of questions...  I reccommend the film to anyone who likes a little scare.  Plus, the film has a nice visual style, which adds to its value.  Thanks for listening.",Null,0,0,1 April 2003
