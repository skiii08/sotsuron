Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Truly Superb
","After viewing this motion picture, I felt complete. It had taken almost six months to watch this movie as a whole, but it was worth the wait. Kill Bill, as a singular film is one of the best of all time, probably Tarantino's best work. Vol.2 as a film worked well, rich in classic Tarantino dialogue, Bill's Superman soliloquy being the perfect example, less of the rapturous violence that filled number one, but made up for by the inclusion of the coolest character in the Kill Bill saga, Pai Mei. His scenes of 'cruel tutelage' shot in a 70's kung Fu movie style really demonstrate Gordon Liu's martial art mastery (yes, the same Gordon Liu that played Johnny Mo in vol.1) All is explained in this concluding chapter, with twists and turns as is to be expected from the great director and a cameo from the man called Sam. The ending of this film had to be good and it is, it is. If you haven't already, watch Vol. 1 on video or DVD, then go to the cinema and watch no. 2, then spend three days trying to remove the smile from your face. A definite five-star masterpiece, ten out of ten, 100% magic movie making.  - Bisto",10,0,1,7 May 2004
