Ali," **/*****
","A somewhat nice movie about a man fighting for his believes. Definitely not a boxing movie. If a boxing movie is what you expect, you won't like 'Ali'. If instead you expect the story of Ali... well you probably won't like it that much either! It's too long and too weak. The only bright spots are the scenes that show those events TV has shown again and again, like interviews, press conferences, boxing matches etc., and quite frankly they're not enough to base an entire movie on. Especially not one this long!What prevented me from falling a sleep was all the great acting, that actually does take place. Especially Will Smith does a GREAT job as Ali. He truly is more than just 'The Fresh Prince of Bel Air'. The acting earns this movie one star! Second star: Because it's nice to see Ali portrayed as more than just a boxer.Overall it's a bearable movie, that shouldn't be watched with too high expectations, but should be watched, though!",3,0,0,15 February 2002
Vanilla Sky," ****/*****
","Good movie in which Cruise shows, that he is more than just a pretty face and a lot of action.Now, the simplest tell as to whether or not a movie is good, is 'does it keep your attention at all times?' - 'Vanilla Sky' does!<ul><li>SMALL SPOILER ALERT -</li></ul>It's about this pretty boy (Tom Cruise), who gets his face ruined in a car 'accident', upsetting him to the point, where it gets difficult for him to tell dreams from reality, eventually making him paranoid. So it seems!What makes this movie as good as it is, is that it it constantly keeps you wondering: 'Is this real or is he dreaming?' - Right up until the truth about it all is uncovered (won't tell you what it is).IMHO the best performance yet by Tom Cruise!",7,0,0,15 February 2002
