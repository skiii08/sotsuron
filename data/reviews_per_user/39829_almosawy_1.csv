The Avengers," My Expectation was more
","After seeing the trailer of the movie and the names and numbers of stars in the movie with a great status as no. 1 top movies and sales of 207 m $ for just the first week with ranking 8.8 i took my family to the theater to watch it , the story is nice but the way it was produced make almost as reading a book with a lot of chatting between main characters . Many other movies like The Dark Night or Iron man 1st movie where great cause of the sum of action but in this movie i think the producer should think a again to use all those stars wisely . The Action part is not shown as any one well expect from a move full of stars of great power and ability.",1,36,93,10 May 2012
