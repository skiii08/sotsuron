The Blair Witch Project," Holds up well
","Compelling and eerie found footage movie about a trio of amateur filmmakers who disappear after hiking into the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch. A modern classic that helped usher in that particular subgenre of horror we have today. Most found footage movies are absolutely terrible and can't hold a candle to this one. It's probably the only movie of its type that ever seemed remotely authentic to me, even though I knew it was all fiction. At the time, people debated whether or not this was actually real. That seems silly, of course, but I knew several people back then who believed what they saw on the screen really happened. A lot of the credit for that should go to the actors, particularly Heather Donahue, for doing such a great job of making it seem believable. I just saw it for the first time in probably a decade or more and, while it doesn't hold the same impact as it did initially, it's still a remarkably well-done low-budget psychological horror movie.Yes the movie was heavily hyped but it was deserved, in my opinion. This was a huge box office success built largely on word of mouth which is a testament to its quality. Sadly, because of its popularity, a lot of people bashed the film (and still do, judging by some of these reviews). If by some chance you have never seen this movie, please ignore the haters and give it a fair shot. I know that, after so many found footage horror movies since it was released, it won't seem as fresh. But I think if you drown out the background noise of the whiners and allow yourself to become immersed in the story, you'll find this movie is one of the best of its kind and worthy of praise.",7,2,3,25 August 2015
The Avengers," 'There's only one God, ma'am, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.'
","Earth's mightiest heroes gather together to fight Loki and an invading alien horde in the payoff to one of the most ambitious cinematic concepts ever, that of a shared universe between multiple films with different characters and stories. My initial reaction when I first saw Avengers three years ago was that I liked it a lot but thought it didn't quite live up to the hype. I saw it again a month later and had an even less favorable opinion, focusing more on the flaws that time around and strictly comparing it to what I considered the truly classic comic book movies. Now that I've seen it with fresh eyes after a few years and several more Marvel films (including the sequel to this one), I can say that all of the hype did influence my first opinion of it. It's hard to dispute now that it is a terrific movie that was probably the best Marvel had put out at that point.Joss Whedon does a fantastic job directing and handling the grand scope of it all. His script is smart, funny, and impressively services all the different characters well. He even improves upon some of them from their previous characterizations, particularly Black Widow. Here we get a vast improvement over her depiction in Iron Man 2. Whedon really gives Scarlett Johansson a chance to shine and prove her character deserves to stand alongside the 'big leaguers' in the group. Mark Ruffalo replaces Ed Norton as Bruce Banner and, at the time, I wasn't crazy about this. I liked Norton in his Hulk movie but I think it turned out to be a good change. Ruffalo brings something different to the role. I'm not sure how Norton could have fit in with this cast or especially how his interactions with Johansson would have been different. Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, and Robert Downey, Jr. are all perfect. Jeremy Renner is arguably the weakest link in the cast but that's largely because he isn't given as much to work with as the others. The special effects are great, except for a couple of iffy spots in the climactic battle against the Chitauri. Also, Captain America's costume was clearly still a work in progress. The blank back where a star should be just makes it seem like incomplete. That's a minor quibble, though.It's not flawless but it's damned entertaining. The action scenes, particularly the fights, are exciting and spectacular. I can't imagine any fan of the comics or the movies being disappointed by them. There's something electric about seeing the characters from the prior movies come together and interact. The little kid in me who was once satisfied to see a shoddy version of Thor appear on TV with Lou Ferrigno's Hulk would never have thought he'd see something like this on the big screen in his lifetime. Seeing these characters hanging out and fighting with and alongside each other is a dream come true for any longtime Marvel fan. Whatever else happens with this shared universe, whether Marvel ever tops this film or not, I'll always cherish the movie just for that.",8,3,18,1 October 2015
Scarface," Brought To You By the Letter F
","Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al Pacino) works his way up through the underworld of Miami with his friend Manny (Steven Bauer) to build a drug empire. Hyper-violent remake of the 1932 Howard Hawks classic is not for the faint of heart but is lots of fun for those who don't take it too seriously. More style than substance but this is Brian De Palma, after all. The Oliver Stone script is full of memorable lines, not to mention an epic number of F bombs. Al Pacino's performance is amusingly over the top. Michelle Pfeiffer is very sexy. It's not a subtle movie and it certainly won't make you ponder the great mysteries of life. But it's very entertaining and, for a remake, surprisingly fresh.",7,1,3,5 August 2014
The Equalizer," 'When you pray for rain you've got to deal with the mud, too.'
","Growing up I was a big fan of the old Edward Woodward TV series. Honestly, this is nothing like that. I'm not even sure why they gave it the same title. The only similarity, aside from the name Robert McCall, is that both stories are about former secret agents (although Denzel's previous occupation is never made clear) who use their abilities to help people in trouble. In the TV series, he placed ads in the paper and people came to him for help. Here he just helps his friends. I was mildly disappointed because I would like to see Denzel play a character a little outside his wheelhouse. What you see here is pure Denzel like we've seen in many movies by now. Still, despite the fact that it's very different from the series I loved, I had no real problems with the movie. It's very entertaining, as you might expect from Denzel Washington. He's one of the most consistent actors out there that puts out good movies for the masses, not just for the film snob crowd. It's slow-going for an action film (note the runtime) but it's never boring. There's no 'reinventing the genre' here but everything is done in such a way that should please the majority of action movie fans. For those wondering, Chloë Moretz plays a small but important part to the story. She isn't in the whole movie, just the first half-hour or so and the final scene.",7,3,5,16 January 2015
50 First Dates," Charming
","Adam Sandler plays a ladies man who falls for adorable Drew Barrymore, only to discover she suffers from a short term memory disorder that causes her to forget everything that happens today. So the next day she relives today over again. Sweet, endearing, funny romantic comedy. Sandler and Barrymore are both great and continue to display the wonderful chemistry they had in The Wedding Singer. Guys, it's not all sappy romantic stuff. Although I personally don't mind that. There's plenty of comedy here, too, with a fine supporting cast that helps bring the laughs. Rob Schneider sucks but everybody else is fun. Love Joe Nakashima's small part. It's a great movie that should put a smile on the face of anyone but the grouchiest among us.",7,2,2,11 May 2014
Iron Man 3," 'I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way.'
","Enjoyable third Iron Man film, far better than the second. It has a lot of detractors, and I can see some of their points, but ultimately I was never bored and had a good time watching it. One of the major complaints is about how they handled the character of the Mandarin, one of Iron Man's biggest villains from the comics. If I had read about it beforehand, I probably would have agreed. But watching it play out, I actually liked it and thought it was quite clever. My only real quibble is that the other villain of the movie (Guy Pearce) is underwhelming. The returning cast members Downey, Cheadle, Paltrow, Favreau are all great. This is probably the best movie in the series for Paltrow, in particular. It doesn't hurt that she's very hot in this. The best scenes involve Downey and a young boy (Ty Simpkins). Fanboys might balk at some parts of this one but I think most people will find it entertaining.",7,1,3,6 August 2014
If I Stay," If you watch
","I went into this blind. I knew nothing about the book it was based upon. It didn't take long before I realized this might not be my thing. It's obviously aimed at a younger audience. Judging by this I will assume the book is also one of those Young Adult type things. That isn't necessarily bad; I've enjoyed several of those movies over the years. This one, though, missed the mark. The narration and music obsession totally got on my nerves. We get it: you like music. 786 references is overkill. It doesn't even feel sincere. Chloe Moretz does a less than impressive job. She's one of the younger actors today whose career I can see either lasting a long time or fizzling out within a few years. We'll see. Her parents here are terrible. The dad is played by the guy from Blair Witch Project. I didn't even know he was still around. Stacy Keach gives the most memorable performance in the movie as the grandfather. The guy she falls madly in love with is a poorly written cliché of a Cameron Crowe character. He has no chemistry with Chloe and their love story is inane. Really, the whole script is just pretentious drivel that tugs on the heart strings with no subtlety at all. It's also overlong and often dull. It makes A Walk to Remember look like a classic.",4,8,17,15 November 2014
Lifeboat," 'Dying together's even more personal than living together.'
","Passengers are set adrift at sea in a lifeboat with one of the Nazis who torpedoed their ship. Sterling John Steinbeck story brought to life by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. The outstanding cast makes it work. It's arguably the best film made by Tallulah Bankhead, John Hodiak, Mary Anderson, and Heather Angel. Walter Slezak, Hume Cronyn, Henry Hull, and William Bendix are also great. Special mention to boxer- turned-actor Canada Lee, largely forgotten today but here gives one of the finest performances from a black actor in the 1940s. I was very surprised to read that many at the time of the film's release, including John Steinbeck himself, thought Lee's character was too stereotypical. I thought the character was portrayed with a dignity and intelligence that was uncommon for the period. A fine character study and an exceptional movie of its type. The type I refer to being films that stick a bunch of different personalities in a claustrophobic environment and watch them crack. It's a low-key film for Hitchcock but an excellent one.",8,0,0,18 August 2014
John Wick," Most Excellent
","Wow what a great surprise this was. I was told by a friend this was good but it's been awhile since I liked a Keanu movie so I was hesitant to try it. Retired hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) loses his wife to cancer. After her funeral he receives a puppy she left him. A few days later some thugs, led by the son of a Russian gangster John used to work for, break into John's house. They beat him up, take the keys to his beloved car, and kill the puppy. They did this not knowing who he was; they just wanted the car. Now John Wick is out for revenge and the Russian gangster is trying to save his son's life by sending killers after John.Keanu's great here. Glad to see him doing something watchable again. Willem Dafoe, Alfie Allen, Ian McShane, and Lance Reddick lead a good supporting cast. Michael Nyqvist was made to play villains. Even Adrianne Palicki was good. Oh and hey the beat-up guy from the Allstate commercials is in this. The stuff with the hotel for assassins and the way they all know each other was pretty funny. About the only problem I had with it was the unrealistic scene where the bad guy finally gets the upper hand on the 'hero' and doesn't kill him. This sort of thing is common in movies but it's always unbelievable and reminds me of the old James Bond villains. This is easily the best action movie this year. Possibly the best straight action movie since the first Taken. English-speaking action movies, that is. It doesn't reinvent the genre or anything but it's entertaining.",7,99,178,22 November 2014
Gravity," Clear skies with a chance of satellite debris
","Gripping space thriller about two astronauts, Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) on her first space shuttle mission and Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) on his last, who have to fight to survive after an accident sets them adrift in space. Visually stunning film that is obviously best seen in 3D. Trust me, I'm not big on 3D and see it for the price gouging gimmick it usually is. However, this is one film where the viewing experience is actually enhanced by it.The story is simple. So simple that it's the type of movie that really depends on its leads more than usual to keep it interesting. But they do deliver. Sandra Bullock is excellent, though admittedly the role does play to her strengths. Clooney plays Clooney, likable and stoic. We're told this is his character's last space flight before retiring. If you've seen any cop movie ever, you know there's not a bigger bullseye to have painted on your back than being on the verge of retirement.It's a good movie. A little over-hyped but these days every moderately good film is over-hyped, unfortunately. Try not to let that prevent you from trying it. You'd be missing out on a solid movie if you did.",7,2,5,29 December 2013
Mulan," 'Let's go kick some Hunny buns! Yee-ha!'
","Enjoyable Disney movie about a young woman named Mulan in ancient China who poses as a man and joins the army so her elderly father will not have to. She proves her worth as a soldier against the invading Huns. Excellent voicework all around with Ming-Na Wen giving a delightful performance as Mulan. Eddie Murphy's comic relief dragon is funny (and obviously a precursor for his work as Donkey in the Shrek series). The songs are nice, though few stay with you for very long after the credits roll. Good score from Jerry Goldsmith. The animation is solid and occasionally impressive. The cultural diversity helps greatly as the story is predictable to a fault. It's got humor and action to spare with a little bit of romance and at least one tearjerker moment. It's not the best movie that Disney put out in the '90s but it's a good one.",6,2,3,8 September 2015
Citizen Kane," One Word to Describe a Man's Life
","When I was fourteen I saw two movies that cemented my love for classic films. One was John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath and the other was Citizen Kane, touted as the 'greatest movie of all time.' You can imagine how skeptical I was going into watching Kane with literally the highest praise you can give a movie hanging on it. However, I was not disappointed. In fact, I was blown away. I was glued to the screen the whole time, fascinated by the actors, the story, the gorgeous Gregg Toland cinematography. Like countless young film fans before me I suddenly had to see more. More movies by Orson Welles, more movies from before I was born, more movies with decades of praise under their belts. Unlike a lot of modern film fans, I don't bristle when Kane is referred to as the greatest movie of all time. I understand why it's called that and take no offense on behalf of films that are more personal favorites of mine to watch. It's difficult to compare movies when tastes are so subjective. Citizen Kane is called the greatest primarily due to its technical accomplishments and how influential it has been, on filmmakers as well as fans. I can certainly attest to the latter from my own experience as it was highly influential in turning me onto movies as more than something you pass the time with. It is a masterpiece of cinema and one of the greatest films of all time, if not THE greatest.",10,2,4,21 June 2014
The Maze Runner," Good of its type
","Good 'Young Adult' sci-fi mystery. Better than most YA movies adapted from books. A few expected clichés but, for the most part, it's a smart movie that doesn't lower itself to pander to an audience expecting more of the same they get from similar films. Perhaps most shockingly for a YA movie, there's no central romance. I am unaware of the books and the relationship between the main guy here and the girl introduced later in the film could very well lead to that in a sequel. But here romance is left out of things, which I found refreshing simply because of how tired and predictable that had become with these sorts of films. It's an entertaining movie with good performances and nice direction. I wish it could have been reworked into a complete story rather than stretched out into a series but I understand how the business works with these things. Still, that feeling of being cheated out of an ending so I'm forced to come back for part 2 is enough of a negative to drop my score some.",7,1,2,10 February 2015
Iron Man 2," Misses the Mark
","Iron Man ranks as one of the best movies made about a Marvel superhero to date. It was going to be a difficult task following that up, no matter what, but a great sequel could have been made had they just taken the time to develop it. But no, money talks, so they rushed this sequel into production and what results is probably the worst of the Marvel shared universe films. That isn't to say it's not worth watching. It still has some good points and Robert Downey, Jr. is most of them. But it has more bad ones. It suffers from the same thing so many superhero movie sequels do. It feels like it needs to cram as many characters and subplots as possible into it. While not as bad as, say, Spider-Man 3 or the Schumacher Batman movies, it's still overkill. They should have kept things simple. Building towards future movies is fine but your first goal should always be to create a good movie that stands on its own.Downey is good, although other reviewers pointing out that sometimes he looks bored is a fair assessment. Mickey Rourke hams it up like you might expect him to. The biggest contribution this movie makes is the addition of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow. Unfortunately, those who like her in the later Avengers or Winter Soldier will likely be disappointed at her performance here. The part isn't well-written and Johansson doesn't rise above the material given her. The rest of the cast is unimpressive. Particularly Don Cheadle, who replaces Terrence Howard as James Rhodes here. Not saying he does a bad job, just nothing that is noteworthy.Iron Man 2 is not a very good movie. It is watchable if you are a fan of the series or comic book movies in general. But it's a bit of a chore to get through for everybody else. Something I can't say for the other Marvel films to date.",5,2,4,23 June 2014
Rocky V," 'It's like everyday you learn something new and everyday I forget something new.'
","Fifth Rocky movie has the Oscar-winning director of the first film, John G. Avildsen, returning to the series. There's nothing Oscar-worthy about this one, though. It's the worst Rocky movie hands down. There are things in it worth seeing for fans of the series but, ultimately, it's not very good. While he doesn't direct this time, Sylvester Stallone does once again write the screenplay. He attempts to return Rocky to his roots, no doubt hoping it would recapture the magic of the first Rocky film. He accomplishes this by having Rocky suffer brain damage from the Ivan Drago fight in Rocky IV (not unrealistic given the superhuman way Drago was portrayed in that film). Due to his injury he talks like a moron and can no longer fight professionally. To make matters worse, he loses his fortune and is now broke. So Rocky, Adrian, and Paulie return to the crummy Philadelphia neighborhood where they started out in the first film. Like I said, the hope was obviously to put the pieces back in place where they were at the start and hope for more magic. There is no magic here, unfortunately.The story has Rocky coaching an up-and-coming fighter named Tommy Gunn, played by real-life boxer (and supposed grandnephew of John Wayne) Tommy Morrison. Rocky mentors Tommy but neglects his own son (played by Stallone's son Sage). As Rocky realizes the mistakes he's made, Tommy is turned against his mentor by flamboyant boxing promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant). Inevitably this leads to a climactic fight between Rocky and Tommy. This time the fight takes place on the streets of Philadelphia, not in a boxing ring.The biggest problem (but not the only one) with this movie is the acting. Tommy Morrison is an absolutely terrible actor. Just awful. He has a constipated look on his face in every scene and his line delivery is cringeworthy. Richard Gant hams it up as the Don King-inspired Duke character. He's just completely over-the-top and grates on the nerves very quickly. He does seem to be having more fun than anyone else in this, though. Sage Stallone does a decent job. Probably wasn't easy making his film debut opposite his superstar dad in a successful franchise. So points to him for doing as well as he did. His character is much older than he was in Rocky IV, by the way. Talia Shire and Burt Young phone their parts in. Sly seems to be parodying himself at times but still provides the movie with its heart. Burgess Meredith returns to the series for a flashback cameo and outclasses everybody else by a mile. His brief appearance is the best part of the movie.Bill Conti returns to provide music after missing Rocky IV. His score is good but the soundtrack of hip-hop songs, including the wretched 'Go For It,' is weak. The final fight is exciting despite it not fitting in with the 'if Rocky fights again he'll die' diagnosis given at the beginning of the film. I suppose the series had been increasingly depressing with the last two films killing off beloved characters, but the action and upbeat tone of the second halves of both of those films made it easier to take. This one is drab and ugly and, in the end, Rocky wins nothing more than meaningless bragging rights among the slack-jawed hoods cheering him on in a back alley brawl.",5,3,3,7 July 2015
The Babadook," Good But Overrated
","Why are so many of the reviews here giving this a 9 or 10 taking the time to insult everyone who feels otherwise? I get it with movies based on superheroes or popular book series -- they have rabid fans who lash out. But why this? It's just a horror movie. And, honestly, an overrated one. I'm not saying its bad. It's actually a good watch. But the praise is pretty over the top. It's a well-crafted movie of its type but not an instant classic or any of that hyperbole. One thing I was very happy about was that it actually did follow through with the advertised premise. As I was watching it, about midway through I became concerned this was not going to be a movie about a supernatural creature but rather a message movie about mental illness and child abuse. Thankfully the movie dispels that in the last twenty or so minutes.It's a pretty good (but not great) movie with a couple of nice scares and shocks. However, I didn't find it to be as groundbreaking or unique as many other reviewers. Sometimes I think horror fans are dying of thirst so every little drop of water is oversold as being on par with 'fill in the blank with a classic horror film.' It's not all that. It's just not. And the mom and kid got on my nerves big time before the first hour was up. This is a movie with a lot of scenes of people being assholes. A lot of yelling, etc. If you're like me that stuff drains you after awhile. I had a headache by the end. Speaking of the end, I'm unsure how I feel about it. Kudos for not tying it all up too neatly but I didn't quite get what the hell Babadook was and, more importantly, why is it eating worms? I kinda like the weirdness of that. Hope they don't ruin it by doing a sequel. Who are we kidding, of course they will.",6,11,31,1 December 2014
Oldboy," 'You can't find the right answer if you ask the wrong questions.'
","A man (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years without knowing why or who is behind it. He is then mysteriously released and given clothes, money, and a cell phone. He sets out to try and find answers so he can get revenge on who imprisoned him. Along the way he becomes involved with a pretty young chef (Kang Hye-jung).It's a good film but perhaps not as great as it's made out to be. The plot is riddled with contrivances and holes. So try to turn your brain off or else you won't enjoy it as much. Also, and I can't stress this enough, the plot twist to this film is big so please stop reading about it until you have seen it. It's like knowing nothing about The Sixth Sense and trying to read info on it. The odds are 100 to 1 the film's twist will be spoiled for you. Without that plot twist, the rating on this one goes down some. So go into it blind if you can.",7,1,5,5 February 2014
Spider-Man 2," 'I believe there's a hero in all of us.'
","Being Spider-Man is wrecking poor Peter Parker's life. He's had to give up his chance at love with Mary Jane, he can't hold a job because he's always late, his grades are suffering at college, his Aunt May is struggling with the loss of beloved Uncle Ben, and his best friend Harry blames Spider-Man for the death of his father. All of this leads to Peter deciding to give up being a superhero. But a new threat rises in the form of mad physicist Otto Octavius, dubbed Dr. Octopus by the press, that may force Peter out of retirement.Sam Raimi's direction is much improved from the first film. This one he seems completely at home with the big budget blockbuster and creates many memorable scenes and images, as he often does in his lower budget work. Comic fans should appreciate the homages to the works of Lee, Ditko, and Romita, The CGI improves from the first film. There's still a little bit of the rubbery animated look of the CGI humans but not as distracting as before. The action is also more impressive. The fight scenes between Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus are well-done. The scene where Spidey saves an elevated train is arguably the movie's highlight. Danny Elfman's music is good but, as with the first film, not in the same league as his iconic Batman work.The cast knocks it out of the park. Tobey Maguire perfectly captures the essence of Peter Parker, even more so than the first movie. His inherent nerdiness, awkwardness, and struggle to do what's right even at the cost of his own happiness. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco build upon their performances from the last movie. Dunst rises above the damsel-in-distress role she's saddled with quite nicely and by the end finally feels like the iconic Mary Jane ('Go get 'em, Tiger.'). Rosemary Harris gets far more to do as Aunt May this time around and she's amazing. She steals every scene she's in. The supporting cast (J.K. Simmons and the rest) are all great. Alfred Molina brings Dr. Octopus to life and treats the character seriously, which is miles above the hammy performance given by Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin in the first film.When this came out, it was the best superhero movie since Superman '78. I walked out of the theater beaming from ear to ear and feeling like a kid again. It was one of the rare summer blockbusters I went to see more than once. It still holds up and is a high water-mark for Marvel movies, in my opinion. It's followed by a terrible third film and then a reboot series that, while good, misses a lot of what makes this film work so well. This is the definitive Spider-Man movie. Lots of humor, heart, romance, and action all told in a bright, colorful fashion. Everything a Spider-Man film should be.",9,13,17,29 May 2014
Point Break," Point Broken
","Let's put aside the asinine logic that went into the decision to remake Point Break to begin with. Let's just focus for a moment on whether or not they produced a good movie, regardless of whether it was an original idea or not. When we do that I think most of us can agree they failed miserably. This is a boring, unengaging movie in every way. The two leads are lacking in any charisma or appeal. They are both just so dull and lifeless I cannot begin to understand how they were cast in an action movie, let alone a remake of a superior action movie with two leads that played well off each other. But these two being so boring fits the tone of the film, one of the more unexciting excuses for an action movie I've ever seen. The original Point Break was a fun movie. This thing is dire and seems to believe it has a message, which makes it even worse. It's really just a lackluster movie all around. I guess the one positive it has over the original is that Teresa Palmer is nice to look at and the original movie just had Lori Petty.",2,14,16,23 May 2016
Batman Returns," 'I was their number one son and they treated me like number two.'
","My brother and I walked out of the theater in 1992 feeling like our souls had just been crushed. We had both loved Batman so we eagerly anticipated its sequel and we came away disappointed by what seemed like a bloated mess of a sequel with too many villains, too much humor, and no clear focus. We also both hated the Max Shreck character played by Christopher Walken and felt he was just in the way of things. Time has altered my opinions on this film a great deal but I include my initial teenage reaction for comparison. I still feel it's a flawed movie and one that often feels more like a director's cut than your average edited-down theatrical release. As a whole, I'm not sure the narrative of the movie is at all times clear and a lot of that does have to do with juggling several plot lines and main characters. I'm still not entirely convinced Christopher Walken is necessary to the movie at all, though like most people I do enjoy his performance. Which is kind of my opinion on Batman Returns in a nutshell: there's a lot to enjoy but on the whole it's a movie that could stand a good trimming.Michael Keaton is a very good Batman. Perhaps the best ever. But once again, the focus is on the villains. Danny DeVito's Penguin is gruesome and miles apart from his comic book counterpart. I never really had a problem with this as I always thought the Penguin was a lame villain anyway. At least DeVito's is scary. There's also a good deal of dark humor to be had with him and some camp value, such as his assault on Gotham with penguins mounted with missiles. That part's admittedly more adorable than exciting, though. Michelle Pfeiffer's sexy Catwoman has become an iconic movie character in her own right; the standard by which all other Catwomen are judged. So far they've come up short. She has many of the movie's best lines. Christopher Walken is amusing in that Walken way as an original character for the film, Max Shreck.Even more so than the first film, Tim Burton creates a film full of amazing visuals and eye-popping special effects. At times decidedly campy, it never crosses the line that Joel Schumacher's repulsively gaudy films did. The only real problem with the movie, like I said before, is that it feels overstuffed with ideas and characters. While I believe Max Shreck could have been eliminated and the movie would not have been hurt at all, I think you could have kept him and still helped the movie out by editing some scenes down and quickening the pace a bit. Still, it's a fantastic sequel with great style and atmosphere. Memorable character and set designs, special effects, and good performances all around. It's too flawed to be considered Burton's masterpiece (at least in my opinion) but it's also too impressive to be ignored.",7,2,7,24 April 2014
Creed," 'Time takes everybody out.'
","Spin-off of the Rocky franchise (or seventh film in the series, since Sylvester Stallone reprises his role in this one) has Apollo Creed's son Adonis 'Donnie' Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) turning to Rocky Balboa for training. Basically what we have here is the same old Rocky formula, updated for today with a few cosmetic changes. The biggest thing working against this is the familiarity, but I admit that might only factor in with those who are fans of the previous films. Had Stallone not revisited Rocky a decade ago, this would be much more impactful for me. As it is, there is this feeling that they're going back to the well again in an attempt to revive the franchise with young blood. Nothing wrong with that but it does make the movie less effective and hard to see as anything other than another sequel.Michael B. Jordan continues to be unimpressive to me, particularly with emotional scenes. He isn't bad just not worthy of the constant praise I see for this young man, heralding him as one of the next big stars. Sylvester Stallone easily steals the film in his signature role. It's no surprise that most of the acting props for the film seem to be going his way. Nothing in this really stretches his abilities but he does what he does well. Tessa Thompson is the film's other standout as Jordan's love interest. She's lovely and gives a subtle, relatable performance. Jordan could learn a thing or two from his co-star while he's busy glowering all the time.The climactic fight is not terribly exciting (a cardinal sin for a boxing film) and the villain is forgettable. I appreciate they gave him his own story to make us care more going into the fight but the guy playing him is neither charismatic nor particularly interesting. As with the last two Rocky films, they went with a real boxer as the antagonist and, while this may make them better suited for the fight scenes, it doesn't do much for the film overall as they bring nothing to the table a good stuntman can't bring. Get an actor for the villain next time, please. Preferably one who looks like he's seen the inside of a gym as this guy looked pathetic.If you're a Rocky fan, you'll likely enjoy it as it carries the formula well and does credit to the previous films. It's nothing really new past the surface changes but that isn't always a deal-breaker. If you're someone who has never seen a Rocky movie (particularly the first or last), then you'll probably find this a far more impressive achievement than it really is. It's a good crowd-pleaser of a movie but nothing more substantial than that.",6,3,6,16 January 2016
The Great Dictator," 'Wouldn't it be wonderful if they let us live and be happy again?'
","Thought-provoking satire, brilliant at times, with memorable performances from a great cast. Drags a little in the middle but not enough to kill the pace. This was Charlie Chaplin's first full talkie. He plays dual roles and does a good job in both. Paulette Goddard has one of her most likable parts here ('Gee...ain't I cute?'). I'm not the biggest fan of hers but she is admittedly endearing in this picture and will likely win over most viewers like she did me. Excellent support from Jack Oakie, Henry Daniell, Reginald Gardiner, and many more. It's a funny movie but not a knee-slapper. The most powerful parts of the film, the parts that I think have made it such a classic, are the more serious parts. The famous speech scene near the end is something everyone should see. One of those moments where a movie can be something profound. That this movie was made when it was is all the more impressive. It's a time capsule in some ways but with a message that still resonates today.",9,1,2,22 September 2014
Constantine," Keanu & Rachel's Excellent Adventure
","First things first, this bears little to no resemblance to the comics but let's put that aside and judge it on its own merits. All things considered, it's not a bad movie of its type. It's entertaining enough, despite feeling like a mash-up of familiar exorcist and superhero action movie tropes. Some of the CGI isn't up to snuff and there aren't really any memorable scenes. Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz are fine, though this is more up his alley than hers. She's better than this type of movie. Shia LaBeouf is amusing in a part that's not really needed. Tilda Swinton steals every scene she's in. Djimon Hounsou is also good. Fans of the Hellblazer comics are most likely to be disappointed, and that's understandable, but the movie really is not bad for what it is.",6,1,2,20 May 2014
About Time," Enjoyable despite flaws
","Pleasant romantic comedy about a young man (Domhnall Gleeson) who is told by his father (Bill Nighy) on his 21st birthday that all the men in his family possess the ability to travel back in time. He proceeds to use this new gift repeatedly to help him fix mistakes in his life and to help him with his relationship with a pretty girl (Rachel McAdams). As a romantic comedy with some tearjerker moments, it's very enjoyable and nice. As science fiction, it will give you headaches with all the plot holes. So the more unforgiving sci-fi fans out there might want to skip this one. I didn't mind it much at first but it got more complicated as it went along. The plot itself is reminiscent of Groundhog Day and maybe a little bit of Somewhere in Time. Gleeson and McAdams both do very well and have great chemistry. McAdams is especially likable. Gleeson has an appealing 'young Hugh Grant' quality about him. Bill Nighy steals the show from everybody, as is often the case. It's a good movie if you don't think too hard about it. But I must stress if you are someone who is a stickler for flaws in plots or someone who nitpicks time travel stories, you will really hate this. Everybody who doesn't fit that description should definitely check it out.",6,15,29,25 January 2014
Don Jon," Not a bad movie but not for me
","For starters, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's fine as you might expect but I was most surprised by Scarlett Johansson. She's not an actress I've ever been overly-impressed with but here she shows some range and is pretty good. I also enjoyed Tony Danza and Glenne Headly as his parents. The film starts out like a sort of romantic comedy but turns into something less pleasant and more artsy. Once Julianne Moore enters the picture, things go downhill. I quickly realized what was about to happen with the story and, not being a big fan of Moore's, my interest level dropped significantly. I liked the chemistry and banter between Levitt and Johansson early on. I didn't like the Levitt/Moore chemistry. She looks like his grandmother so that was off-putting to me. Yes, I realize that's shallow and will upset some people but that's how I feel. I didn't find their scenes romantic or sexy at all. The funny bits are sparse and what it's trying to say is not as profound as it seems to believe. I appreciate Joseph Gordon-Levitt's talent. He's a very likable actor and he directs this very well. He could have a big future ahead of him as a director. My criticisms of the movie are solely from an entertainment perspective, which is subjective obviously. I'm not a pompous indie film fan. Maybe if I was I would love it more. It's just not my cup of tea.",5,2,4,1 February 2014
X-Men," 'We are the future, Charles, not them.'
","There have been so many comic book movies since the year 2000, and quite a few of them X-Men movies, that it may be a good idea to think back to when this movie came out and remember this got the ball rolling. Yes, there had been Batman and Superman before that, but they were DC properties that seemed to exist within a little bubble all their own. There was also Blade but that was a supernatural action movie. A lot of people didn't even know it was based on a comic book character. This movie was the first successful superhero movie based on Marvel comics characters. It took the source material seriously and treated it with respect. It did away with the notion that superheroes were solely kids stuff and what followed was a wave of comic movies based on Marvel properties that is still going strong today.The casting is mostly spot-on. Hugh Jackman became a star overnight due to his performance as Wolverine. It's hard to imagine he'll ever have another role to top this one or that they'll ever be able to recast with an actor better-suited for the part. And no, nerds, don't say he's not the perfect Wolverine just because he's not physically identical to the comics version. Open a window, people. The casting of Patrick Stewart as Professor X was a no-brainer and he's also perfectly suited for the part. Ian McKellen's excellent as Magneto. It's arguable he's older than he should be but he's so good in the role it really doesn't matter. Rebecca Romijn (Mystique), Halle Berry (Storm), Anna Paquin (Rogue), and Famke Janssen (Jean Grey) are all great, as well. I especially enjoyed the chemistry between Jackman and Paquin. Their scenes are some of the film's best moments. Not all of it is a home run. James Marsden's wooden performance as Cyclops is something of a negative. He has no chemistry with Famke Janssen, which ultimately weakens that portion of the film. Tyler Mane's monosyllabic Sabretooth and Ray Park's ridiculous Toad are both lame. These two are frequently mentioned by the movie's detractors and I find it hard to defend them. They are also the worst of the 'Hollywoodizations' of the characters' appearances, something they all suffer from. Despite the movie's many strengths, it still exists within the narrow mindset that you can't do movies with people in colorful costumes without it appearing silly. So, hey, black leather y'all because that's not something you literally see all the time in movies.For some reason, this first movie gets a lot of flack today in certain circles. Is it perfect? No, but neither are some of these more recent superhero movies that have been hailed as masterpieces. The direction is strong, the script is smart, the acting is wonderful. There are some flaws and I've addressed a few but, on the whole, it's a fantastic film that entertains me every time I watch it. There have been some good (and bad) X-Men movies since this one but this stands as the one I rewatch most often.",8,3,4,31 May 2014
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Turd
","What a stinker. A huge disappointment following the fantastic Spider-Man 2. This sequel had a checkered production with a lot of studio interference so I'll cut Sam Raimi some slack. However, I'm not sure his original idea for the movie would have been much better. There's way too much camp and comedy in this. Also, as is so sadly common with superhero movie sequels, they felt the need to tack on more new characters and villains. Like more villains really helped the '90s Batman franchise. Just stupid backwards corporate focus group logic.Anyway, there isn't a positively memorable scene, line, or performance in this film. The only parts people remember are terrible, such as wall-eyed Topher Grace's embarrassing Venom. Thomas Haden Church is actually decent as Sandman, although the way he is shoehorned into the events of the first movie is insulting and offensive to me as a Spider-Man fan. Kirsten Dunst, who I've defended many times from her critics, is awful here. For some reason now, Mary Jane's not just an actress but a singer. Whatever. James Franco looks like he's ready for the movie to be over the whole time. Tobey Maguire is having a field day with the campy scenes he gets and I couldn't hate him more for it. I'm really disgusted with this movie. The direction is half-hearted, the script a mess, and the effects spotty. Sandman effects are okay but the Venom stuff is dreadful. Watch this only if you want to complete the series but be prepared for the worst.",4,2,4,6 July 2014
The Hateful Eight," A let-down but still worth a look
","The good - it's Quentin so the dialogue is interesting, the characters are colorful, and the direction is stylish. If you're a fan of his work, you'll probably find something to like here even if, like me, you don't love the movie as a whole. The bad - it's overlong, surprisingly stagy, dripping with anger and ugliness with far too many of the usual Tarantino excesses. The coarse language, cheap attempts at gore, and constant racial epithets are nothing new but it just felt like he was trying too hard and I'm not really sure what he was trying to prove. Just a suggestion but perhaps it's time for Quentin to evolve as a filmmaker and learn to make his points with some eloquence instead of throwing feces at people to get attention. Probably the biggest sin is the length of the film. There's no reason for this to be nearly three hours (and certainly no reason for it to be over three, as with the roadshow version). The first hour needs severe cuts as nothing much happens and whole scenes feel like they're repeating what happened five minutes earlier. The cast does a fine job playing unlikable characters. Yeah, they're all over-the-top, but given the slow pacing and the fact that the movie feels like a foul-mouthed variation on the old 'drawing room mysteries,' some loud performances are kind of necessary. Look, I know most of my review has been complaining but it's not that I hated the movie. I just think it could and should have been better. As it is, it's worth watching but not one of Tarantino's best.",6,8,35,4 January 2016
The Polar Express," Sometimes the most real things in the world are the things we can't see
","A magical train carries a doubting boy and other children to the North Pole on Christmas Eve. When Polar Express was first released, I wanted nothing to do with it. The computer animation left me cold and I thought the eyes of the people were particularly soulless. However a few years ago a friend guilted me into watching it. I've watched it every year since. As for the animation, most of it is excellent. I love the train stuff. But the people are still a little mannequin-like. But, after repeated viewings I hardly notice anymore. The voice actors are all good. Hanks plays multiple roles and does quite well. The hobo was my favorite. It's a charming, magical, heartwarming Christmas movie. It makes me happy to know new ones are still being made as it sometimes seems like quality Christmas films are a thing of the past.",7,1,5,25 December 2013
The Best Years of Our Lives," One of the Best Films Ever Made
","Beautiful, brilliant film about three WWII veterans and their families struggling to adjust to changes in their lives after the war. Frederic March and Dana Andrews give exceptional performances; possibly their best. Real-life veteran Harold Russell, who lost his hands in the war, steals the show in probably the best acting I've ever seen from a novice. He's really amazing. The supporting cast includes wonderful actresses Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, Gladys George, and Cathy O'Donnell. There isn't a bad performance in the film. It's director William Wyler's best. It won seven Oscars plus received two honorary ones. This is definitely a must-see film. One of the all-time greats.",10,3,3,7 February 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," 'I'm 95. I'm not dead.'
","Very good sequel that seems to be slightly overrated. That's kind of the norm with comic book movies these days, for a variety of reasons. It's not a big deal, really. Time is the true test of a movie's rating. The observation about the movie that it is less a superhero movie than a spy action/thriller is accurate, I think. Of all of the Marvel movies so far, this certainly seems to be the one least concerned with superheroics. A primary reason for this is probably due to the movie being inspired by the Cap comics of the last decade, which are much darker than they used to be and more spy stories than superhero ones. I'm not a fan but there's no point in getting into that here. For the purposes of this film, it works well and towards the end when Evans finally dons the proper Cap superhero costume (or at least the closest we'll get to it in these movies), it's a powerful moment.Chris Evans, not surprisingly, is terrific. If he hadn't before, he has certainly proved himself as an actor in the role of Captain America. He's brought more to the part than I think anyone ever expected from him. I was a little concerned about the large cast going into this. I was afraid there were so many characters, all with significant roles, that Cap would wind up being sidelined in large parts of his own movie. Thankfully, that is not the case. The other characters add to his story instead of taking away from it. Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance from any of the films Black Widow has appeared in so far. She and Evans have a great chemistry together, which is good since they are paired up for most of the film. Anthony Mackie is lots of fun as Sam Wilson/The Falcon. Hopefully in future movies he will get a more colorful costume. Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Redford are both good. I doubt that shocks anyone. Sebastian Stan spends a lot of the movie with his face covered and simply there to be a villain who can fulfill the movie's action quota. But as the movie progresses and the audience learns more about his character, he gets to act more and does an admirable job. It is kind of funny Winter Soldier is the B plot in this considering the movie's title.The script is much tighter than the first Cap film. The special effects and action are very good but, as in the first film, there are no scenes that stay with you. If there is a singular 'flaw' with the Marvel movies, it's that most of them simply try to be an entertaining movie with no aspirations to be anything more artistically. To use a baseball analogy, they seem to be content to get singles and doubles. They aren't trying to swing for the fences. I'm all for great popcorn movies, of course. I just think you can be that and also have memorable moments and scenes that stick with people for years. Thinking back on this movie that I just watched a week ago, there are no iconic moments that come to mind. Still, it's a very good movie that I would recommend everyone check out. I would caution you not to make this your first stop in the Marvel cinematic universe though or you're likely to be lost about a lot of the characters and plot.",8,1,3,25 April 2014
Over the Top," Meet Sly Halfway
","So you think you've seen every movie about an arm wrestling truck driver absentee father road trip-bonding with his son who's just graduated from military school? Well, think again. This is one of Sylvester Stallone's most underrated movies. It gets a lot of flack because the premise sounds so ridiculous but it's actually a good little drama with some nice action of the arm wrasslin' variety. One of Cannon's more polished films. You'll learn everything you need to know about the power of wearing one's cap backwards and the eternal question of who exactly will the world meet halfway. Also some great rockin' tunes from the '80s! What's not to like about this movie?",7,4,5,12 June 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," Little Pieces of One Big Soul
","The Grapes of Wrath is one of the two films I can thank for my love of classic movies. When I was a kid I had enjoyed a few older films. Mostly stuff like The Wizard of Oz and It's a Wonderful Life that I had been weaned on from an early age. But, like most kids, I was far more into the movies of my time. I viewed most older movies, especially black & white ones, with a degree of contempt. However, that changed when I was fourteen. That summer I checked out two older movies on VHS from my local library. I had heard a lot about one of these movies being called 'the greatest movie of all time' and the other I knew was based on a book that fourteen year-old me just wasn't about to voluntarily read (although I did read it years later). So I took them both home and watched them back to back, glued to the screen the whole time. The two films were Citizen Kane and The Grapes of Wrath and I was in love with classic movies from that point on. Interestingly enough, both films had legendary cinematographer Gregg Toland working on them.The Grapes of Wrath is a beautiful, haunting masterpiece from director John Ford, who deservedly won an Oscar. Nunnally Johnson's script brings John Steinbeck's novel to life but gives it a more optimistic finish. The cast is extraordinary, with Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell giving exemplary performances. It's a classic film in every sense of the word. To say I recommend it wouldn't be strong enough. This is just one of those films you HAVE to see.",10,1,2,31 December 2013
Rocky II," 'I've never seen so many Italians in my whole life!'
","Following up a classic is hard to do. Rocky was a perfect film that, if we're to be honest, didn't need a sequel. But the nature of the business is what it is so sequels to box office successes are inevitable. This is the first sequel in the Rocky series, all of which are less inspired than the original but still entertaining in their way. The story in this one has Rocky marrying Adrian and trying to step away from boxing. Meanwhile Apollo Creed has trouble dealing with how the first fight went down. So he challenges Rocky to a rematch, leading Rocky to once again train with Mickey for the big fight.The cast from the first film returns and all are excellent. Stallone not only acts and writes again but this time steps into the director's seat. There are some great moments in this one, and it is certainly a very good movie, but it stands in the shadow of the first film more so than the later movies in the series. In part because it's the first sequel but also because it's the only one that looks and feels similar to the first Rocky. But that's also part of what's so good about it. It's an enjoyable, albeit unnecessary, continuation of the story from that film.",7,1,1,6 July 2015
Ant-Man," Fun but nothing special
","I'll admit I wasn't looking forward to this one. I was barely looking forward to it when Edgar Wright was attached, but after his very public break from the project I had zero expectations this would be anything but a trainwreck. I'm happy to say that it wasn't as bad as I feared. It actually isn't bad at all. A little 'meh' perhaps but not bad. I enjoyed it for what it is, even if it's probably one of the last Marvel movies I'll be in any hurry to rewatch anytime soon. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are fine but do little to impress. Corey Stoll is a generic villain, forgettable in every way. Michael Peña and T.I. do a good job in their comedy relief roles. Anthony Mackie is fun as Falcon in his brief appearance. The best part of the movie, somewhat surprisingly, is Michael Douglas. I had doubts he would approach the part seriously, as a lot of actors from his generation look at comic book movies as an excuse to be campy. But he doesn't approach it that way and shines throughout the movie, easily overshadowing everyone else. I thought the scene where he was de-aged with special effects was nicely done. The effects were pretty good overall. The major negatives for the movie are that it never feels like it amounts to much and there are no memorable set pieces. There are so many ways to approach the character of Ant-Man, humorously and dramatically, that would have been more effective but also more risky. They chose to play it safe and I suppose I can't fault them for that. As it is, it's an enjoyable lightweight action comedy.",6,3,15,1 December 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," The Sentinel of Liberty
","Captain America is Marvel's Superman. A hero respected by all. All who matter, at least. It was a daunting task to bring him to the big screen but they did an amazing job. The acting is terrific. Chris Evans IS Cap and was spot-on casting, though I initially had my doubts when he was first announced. He brought the character to life in ways that few actors today could have. He's immensely likable and gives Cap that presence that he has to have for us to believe people would respect and follow him, especially since the movie has to unfortunately rush his earning that respect. Hayley Atwell is an excellent Peggy Carter, beautiful and strong. Hugo Weaving is a little one-note as the Red Skull but that's a problem with the script more than his performance. Tommy Lee Jones is fine in an unnecessary role as a cynical Army colonel.The special effects are fabulous. The look of the Skull and the way they convincingly placed Evans' face on the skinny body were both praiseworthy effects. I also enjoyed the old school sci-fi machinery and technology. They did a great job getting down the look of the period, if not always the lingo. The action was good, though there were no real stand-out sequences. The tone of the film was perfect. It's nice to have superhero films not steeped in navel-gazing and pathos. The Marvel films in general are excellent in this area compared to the DC films or the Marvel ones made by other studios. Superhero films don't all have to follow a mold but it's good to have bright, positive characters like Captain America represented in films the way they should be. However, it's not all perfect. I did have a few problems. First, the costume. I guess they did their best and this is likely to be the most faithful representation we'll ever get but I still wish it had been more classic Cap than modern Cap. Comics fans will know what I mean. Second, the fight with Red Skull was extremely brief. All that buildup for something that lasted a minute. Third, I'm not a big fan of movies that don't feel like they have a beginning, middle, and end. I give some latitude on intended trilogies like Lord of the Rings but movies like this should be able to stand on their own while also setting up for sequels. I just felt this one ended just as things were getting really good. I knew the story would continue on in other movies but I don't see why Cap, like Thor and Iron Man, couldn't have a complete movie of his own that also served its purpose on the larger shared universe story with the other films. The last half-hour felt rushed and the cliffhanger ending, while poignant, stuck a bit in my craw.Those criticisms aside, it's a marvelous film (no pun intended). It accomplished what it needed to. It brought a hard-to-translate character to the big screen in an impressive way. It paid proper respect to Steve Rogers, the man, and Captain America, the symbol. It treated the character seriously with no snide sideways remarks or 21st century cynicism about patriotism. Most importantly, it's just a fun movie with the right mix of humor, action, and heart.",7,1,3,24 April 2014
American Hustle," Don't Do the Hustle
","This kind of movie does nothing for me. It's not about story or characters. It's not even a showcase of any kind of craftsmanship or style. It's just a self-indulgent vanity project for various actors to play dress-up in retro '70s clothes and try to out-ham each other. The film is an awkward mix of drama and comedy with pretensions of being something akin to Goodfellas. You can tell as you watch that there is a lot of improv going on. Everyone acts in this overdone manner that gets old fast. Of the cast, Jennifer Lawrence comes out best. Amy Adams looks great and probably offers the closest to Lawrence in terms of an enjoyable performance. But the material (or lack of it) lets her down. It lets them all down, really. Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner are both fine, though much better than this film and the stupid hairstyles they are forced to wear to get laughs. Bradley Cooper is the worst, as he often is. He's such a try-hard and I am baffled by the continued push this mediocre actor is getting. Any movie where he is praised I automatically want to avoid it, as experience has taught me he is a very limited dramatic actor and only marginally better with comedy. David O. Russell is obviously the flavor-of-the-month right now so I'm not surprised at the amount of hype this film has received and how completely overrated it is. See it if you have a couple of hours to kill but don't expect much.",5,6,10,15 February 2014
The Godfather: Part II," 'If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.'
","Phenomenal sequel to The Godfather is split between two stories. One follows the events of the first movie as Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) deals with strife inside and outside the family as he works to expand the business. The other tells the story of a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) and his rise to power.The greatest sequel of all time? Yeah I can't see many doubts about that. It's often said to be even better than the first movie. I don't see the point in splitting hairs over it. I'll just say that I love both films a lot, though I rewatch the first one more often than this one. For the optimum experience you should watch both movies back-to-back like they're one long film. As with the first movie, this is pretty much flawless. I can't think of a thing about it I would change.",10,5,8,15 July 2014
Rush," When was the bar lowered?
","Not bad but terribly overrated drama. Seems like these days every movie that is halfway good is over-hyped and hailed as a masterpiece. I don't know when it happened but at some point in the last decade or so the bar was lowered. Now every moderately good film is lumped in with the greatest of all time. I'm no racing fan but I have enjoyed racing films before. Rush is overlong and doesn't build to anything really. The ending, or more to the point the last half hour, felt like a story searching for a powerful finish that it never found. I know this is based on real people and events, but I fail to see how that matters in the context of judging how they told the story. A dramatic film is not a documentary and artistic license is acceptable and, in many cases, desperately needed. What it comes down to is that this is a middle-of-the-road drama. Nothing exceptional and certainly nothing new. The performances are adequate, but nothing to rave about. The story, real or not, is fractured and lacking in any sense of a point in the end. I felt like I learned nothing of significance about the two men that the film focuses on. This is particularly true for James Hunt, portrayed by Chris Hemsworth. Other than being a walking cliché, what else was there to the man? The film has no answers. It has few more for Daniel Bruhl's Niki Lauda. Perhaps if they had chosen to focus on just one of the men rather than both, they could have told a more interesting story. As it is, it's a superficial drama about two men with unimpressive racing footage sprinkled throughout.",5,12,25,11 February 2014
Man of Steel," I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
","From the opening scenes on Krypton where we see Jor-El being an action movie hero fighting, shooting guns, and riding flying dragons, it's clear this will be like no other Superman movie before...for better or worse. This is a tough review for me to write. I waited a long time to do it. There are two parts of me at war here. The movie fan didn't think it was that bad. The Superman fan hated it beyond belief.The cast is good. Henry Cavill and Amy Adams were much better than I expected. They had nice chemistry, which I liked. Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, etc. are all fine. The flashbacks are the better parts of the movie. That was kind of what I was hoping the movie would be. The present-day stuff varied in quality but got progressively dumber as the movie went along. The special effects are mostly good, although the fight scenes between Superman and the other Kryptonians seem like choppy insertions of video game animation. The codex plot device is a stupid addition to the story and one can only assume it was thrown in with the hope of seeing it pay off in a future sequel, which may not ever happen. The script gives lip service to hope, etc. but it's all mired in gloom and bleakness. Drab, depressing, with very little happiness. The last hour becomes mindless destruction. Don't even get me started on 'that moment.' It enrages me just thinking about it.As a sci-fi action summer blockbuster, I can't deny it's well-made and entertaining on that level. As a Superman movie, it's heartbreaking. Gone are the days of 'you will believe a man can fly.' No more inspiration. Now it's Superman in the 21st century: brutal, cynical, dark, self-absorbed. He's not even allowed to wear the traditional costume anymore, presumably because of infantile 'underwear on the outside' jokes from braindead teenage boys (in age or just in mindset, no difference) raised on dark anti-heroes who have no sense who Superman is and what he stands for. Or rather, stood for. Anyway, off my soapbox. It's not a bad movie, judged solely on its own merits. But characters this iconic don't exist in a vacuum so it's very hard for me to look at it without comparison. See it and decide for yourself.",6,2,7,25 July 2014
The Caine Mutiny," Much ado about strawberries
","Exceptional military drama about a mutiny on board the USS Caine during WWII. The captain of the Caine is Lt. Cmdr. Philip Francis Queeg (Humphrey Bogart), a man who shows signs of mental instability and reacts badly under stress. Lt. Steve Maryk (Van Johnson) is convinced by cowardly Lt. Tom Keefer (Fred MacMurray) that Queeg is insane and removes him from command during a typhoon. Afterwards, Maryk is court-martialed, along with Ensign Willie Keith (Robert Francis), who helped him.Bogie and MacMurray give excellent performances; two of the best of their long careers. Bogart was deservedly nominated for an Oscar. Jose Ferrer, as the defense attorney for Maryk and Keith, makes a valiant effort at stealing the picture from Bogart. Van Johnson does quite well considering he's more known for his musical comedy roles. Tom Tully shines as Queeg's predecessor. Supporting cast includes the likes of Lee Marvin, Claude Akins, and Jerry Paris. Robert Francis is OK but perhaps comes up short alongside the powerhouse vets in the cast. His romantic subplot is the weakest part of the film. Francis' career was brief as he died in a plane crash the following year. This is his best-known work. There are a lot of memorable moments from this fine film but probably the best is Queeg's insane search for who stole some strawberries! Top cast, director, and script. A classic everybody should see.",8,1,2,3 February 2014
Footloose," I'll Sing to You of Silver Swans
",How can anyone not like this? It's an 80s classic with lots of memorable lines and scenes and one of the best movie soundtracks of all time. Yes it's cheesy and even stupid at times but the cheese just adds flavor and the stupidity adds...well...yeah whatever man. Anyway this is a fun teen flick back when people pushing thirty played teenagers in movies. The way it should be damn it! Any movie that has a montage a half hour in recapping the first half hour is cinematic gold. If you haven't seen this yet please hit yourself and then watch it right away.,8,1,1,4 April 2020
The Thing," 'Maybe we at war with Norway?'
","American researchers at an Antarctic outpost find themselves faced with a shape-shifting alien that can assume the form of any person or animal it absorbs. The rarest of the rare: a remake of a great film that is just as good, if not better, than the original. I don't know if I would say it's better but it's a damn fine film. I love both movies equally. It doesn't just copy the original. As a matter of fact, other than the bare bones of the plot, it's completely different. It adheres more closely to the short story that both Thing films were based on, which was more of a 'body snatchers' paranoia type of story.The Thing boasts one of the strongest casts of any movie made in the last forty years. There's not a weak link in the bunch. Kurt Russell's MacReady is one of his best roles. Wilford Brimley, Richard Dysart, Keith David, Richard Masur, and on down the line are great actors. Everybody gives their all. John Carpenter's direction is excellent. It's been said by many that it's his best work. It's really hard to argue with that. Surprisingly, he doesn't do the score for this one. Instead the great Ennio Morricone scores it but does so in a manner very similar to what Carpenter himself might have done. Rob Bottin's special effects are terrifically fun in the way only old school effects could be. I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's a classic. If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, what are you waiting for?",10,8,11,5 June 2014
Pitch Black," Vin Diesel's Best Movie
","Spaceship is forced to crash on an alien planet with three suns. Among the survivors is a criminal named Riddick (Vin Diesel) who, through a surgical alteration to his eyes, has night vision. Soon it's discovered that the planet is inhabited by nocturnal bloodthirsty creatures. Good thing the planet has three suns and it's always day right? Well, as luck would have it, these people have crashed on the planet at the same time an eclipse is about to begin so all hell is about to break loose. They must rely on Riddick to lead them to safety in the dark. The question is can they depend on a convicted murderer for help? Wonderful character-driven sci-fi action horror movie with a terrific cast. Vin Diesel's best role by miles. The Fast & Furious movies are good for what they are but he doesn't have to do much in them but act tough. Not that this is Othello but at least the character of Riddick has some depth. The rest of the cast is solid with standout turns from Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser. The special effects are good and the action is exciting. A fun thrill ride of a movie. Followed by some lesser sequels.",7,2,4,23 March 2014
The Hills Have Eyes," Repugnant
","Vile degenerative schlock that passes for horror these days. The great debate between horror fans I suppose will always be is horror supposed to be scary or is it supposed to be shocking and stomach-churning. I favor the former but this is the latter. First, the original movie did not need to be remade. But I realize that argument is a lost cause in this creatively bereft age for films, particularly horror films. Remakes are and have been a constant for the last decade. They almost always are terrible of course and a pale shade of the original film. But it doesn't matter. Money talks and people keep watching these things so they keep being made.The favorable reviews for this remake seem to mostly drool over the gross, bloody, rapey shock value of it like that is what a good horror film should be about. Clearly there are those who feel that way and as I've stated, I am not one of them. So if you like that sort of thing check it out and become a little bit worse inside. Otherwise avoid it like the plague. This movie offers nothing but degradation.",1,8,15,29 October 2013
North by Northwest," 'I'd invite you to my bedroom if I had a bedroom.'
","Allow me to add my voice to the overwhelming praise for this classic Alfred Hitchcock thriller; one of the legendary director's best. Cary Grant stars (in the last of four collaborations with Hitchcock) as an advertising executive mistaken for a spy and chased cross-country by foreign agents, as well as the police. What follows is one classic scene after another, including the famous scene where Grant is chased by a crop duster. James Mason and Martin Landau make excellent villains. Eva Marie Saint is the sexy double agent who shares some sizzling scenes with Cary. The two had palpable chemistry. Healthy doses of comedy help make this such an enjoyable watch. A great cast, a rousing score by Bernard Herrmann, and flawless pacing by Hitch are among the many elements that make this one of the most fun and exciting movies ever made.",10,2,4,14 July 2015
Duck Soup," 'You've gotta take up the tax before you can take up the carpet.'
","The last of the Marx Bros. movies to feature Zeppo and the last made at Paramount is also my favorite. The brothers would go on to make some more good movies but, in my view, their Paramount films are when they were at their best. The nonstop zaniness and unpredictability of them was unlike anything else in film comedy at the time. This is a hilarious satire with Groucho in arguably his most famous role, Rufus T. Firefly, the newly-appointed leader of the small country of Freedonia who leads his country into war with neighboring Sylvania. The brothers are all terrific with some of their most memorable gags in this one. Margaret Dumont is back after missing two consecutive movies. Her scenes with Groucho are some of the film's highlights. Louis Calhern makes for a fine villain and Raquel Torres is one of the sexiest women from any of the Marx films. Edgar Kennedy is a hoot as a vendor that has trouble with Chico and Harpo. It's directed by Leo McCarey, who went on to win Oscars and direct some classic films with Cary Grant and Bing Crosby. Duck Soup also has probably the highest quality production values of any of the Marx films at Paramount. The sets and costumes are very nice. It's easy to see why this is considered the Marx Brothers' masterpiece. Aside from being funny from start to finish with hilarious songs and many great gags, it has been highly influential over the years on everything from Bugs Bunny to Woody Allen. One of the greatest comedies ever made and certainly one I recommend everyone see at least once.",10,7,9,20 August 2015
Divergent," Not Bad of Its Type
","Another 'Young Adult' sci-fi action romance flick. As with all the others, let me state upfront I haven't read the books on which this is based, nor do I intend to. I don't have any knowledge of spoilers from the books. I'll just assume the movie follows them for the most part but changes some things here or there. That's usually the case. At any rate, without having read the books, I can say this movie is not as original as it seems to believe it is. It borrows liberally from several sources. Among them is Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World.' But most of it is just following the predictable YA formula. Young woman, pretty but not intimidatingly so, is the 'chosen one' to change the world or some such. Along the way she falls in love with a guy who's just too dreamy for words. It's funny how in these things the girl is always supposed to be something of a plain Jane but the guy has to be a heartthrob. I'm sure someone has written about the hypocrisy of that since men are always criticized for being shallow and thinking about looks first with regards to women...but I digress.The cast does well, with Shailene Woodley (one of Hollywood's much-hyped rising stars of late) doing a fine job. Theo James only has to look handsome so it's to his credit he can actually act. Kate Winslet plays the obligatory corrupt government leader villain. I assume she was paid well. Ashley Judd and eyebrowless Tony Goldwyn play Woodley's parents. Thankless roles for both, really. The performance I enjoyed the most was Zoë Kravitz as Woodley's friend. Sadly, she largely disappears in the second half of the movie. Anyway, there no impressive action sequences or special effects to speak of. It's not that what's there is bad, just that nothing stood out to me. After the movie was over, I didn't say 'Wow remember that scene' or anything like that. Still, I don't regret watching it and I will likely watch the inevitable sequels. As far as these types of movies go, it was decent.",6,1,1,13 January 2015
Ender's Game," Boring
","To start with, I never read the book. So I don't have that baggage of complaints and nitpicks that movies based on books seem to generate from fans. So my review is strictly based on what I thought of the movie. In short, it was competently put together but boring as hell. I'm so sick of stories about people waiting for a leader or a chosen one to guide them. It's been done to death, Hollywood! Yeah I realize it's based on a book from 1985 but, again, this is a review of a movie that came out in 2013 not the book. In 2013 we had seen literally dozens of movies and television shows with very similar plot lines as this in just the last decade.To make matters worse, I hated the cast. Especially Asa Butterfield. I just can't with this kid. If I have to guess whether you are acting badly or if the part is written that way, then you're screwed. As an actor, nine times out of ten you're taking the blame for that one. Usually rightfully so. He wasn't the only one I didn't care for. Harrison Ford goes without saying. Just retire, Harrison, if this is the best you can do at staying relevant. I disliked the entire supporting cast of no-name actors. They were all bland and colorless. The special effects also failed to impress me. They weren't bad, just nothing that will stay with me over time. Forgettable, like this movie. I can't recommend you see this unless you are really young and haven't seen much yet. Because I've seen this type of story done before and better. Many times, actually.",4,3,5,1 March 2014
Rocky IV," 'To beat me he's gonna have to kill me...'
","Probably my favorite Rocky movie behind the original and easily the one I've re-watched the most. It's just sheer '80s goodness that perhaps can only best be appreciated by a child of that decade. The story this time has the Russians introducing a new fighter, drug-enhanced giant Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), to challenge Rocky. But instead of Rocky, they get Apollo. After Drago kills Apollo in what was supposed to be an exhibition match, Rocky travels to Russia to avenge his friend in a match televised across the world on Christmas.Such a fun movie with great characters, memorable lines, and wonderful scenes. Sylvester Stallone stars, as well as writing and directing. Carl Weathers, Talia Shire, and Burt Young all return. All are great. Career-defining role for Dolph Lundgren. Brigitte Nielsen is good as his wife (she would marry Stallone the same year this was released). Vince DiCola steps in to do the score this time and does an excellent job, along with a fantastic soundtrack featuring James Brown, John Cafferty, and Robert Tepper, among others. The fight scenes are among the best of the series. Also some of the best montages you'll ever see. A fantastic fist-pumper of a movie with action, drama, humor, tragedy, and thought-provoking ideas about world peace. Okay, that last part was a stretch but I'm not someone who rolls their eyes at '80s Cold War movies -- I love 'em! Really a terrific piece of entertainment. Nowhere near the artistry of the first film but much more enjoyable than any others in the series.",7,2,4,6 July 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Enjoyable enough but missing something special
","Fifth movie in the Mission Impossible franchise has Ethan Hunt & IMF friends trying to stop a mysterious group known as the Syndicate, despite the IMF being shut down by the government and Ethan being wanted by the CIA. Enjoyable actioner but there's not much new here. Tom Cruise continues to prove he's one of the more consistent stars out there as he always seems to put out solid popcorn movies and occasionally something more than that. The supporting cast is good, with Simon Pegg stealing every scene he's in and Rebecca Ferguson as the attractive assassin who saves Tom throughout the movie. Is she good or is she bad? Will you care? Ving Rhames gets little to do. Sean Harris plays the forgettable villain. Alec Baldwin is the red herring who, along with Jeremy Renner, seems almost unnecessary in making this work. The action is solid and the humor (mostly from Pegg) is appreciated. I have to say that this is not my favorite Mission Impossible movie or even top three. There's something nondescript about it all, similar to the last film. At least the first three each had something about them that was memorable. Now it seems the series is satisfied just putting out a solid action thriller with more focus on stunts than characters, plot, or even style. Watchable for fans but really nothing special.",6,8,12,11 October 2015
Spider-Man," 'You're taller than you look.'
","Nerdy teenager Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bit by a radioactive spider and develops new powers and abilities. After the murder of his uncle, Peter decides to use his powers to help people and fight crime. Meanwhile, billionaire Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) undergoes an experiment that gives him superhuman abilities of his own. It also drives him crazy and sets him on a collision course with Spider-Man.Maguire, James Franco, and J.K. Simmons are all great. Kirsten Dunst wasn't my ideal Mary Jane but she actually does very good. She's likable and pretty, which is about all the part is asking for here. The Green Goblin is probably the movie's biggest failing. They didn't really get his character right and Willem Dafoe's performance is too campy. Changing him into an armored goon didn't help matters.The bright, mostly upbeat tone is exactly what a Spider-Man movie needs. However, it does highlight some of the fakeness of the CGI. The special effects are generally good although at times when Spider-Man is complete CGI he has that rubber-limbed thing going on. The organic web shooters bothered me more before I saw the movie than it did while watching. Although I could've done without the gross microscopic closeups of his fingertips to show us how 'spidery' he is. Danny Elfman's score is forgettable and not in the same league as his work with Batman.Not quite the defining movie for Spider-Man as '78 Superman or '89 Batman were for those characters, but good nonetheless. The part of the movie where Peter decides to become a superhero and start fighting crime seems a little rushed and not as momentous as it should have been. It's a good start, though, and the sequel would be all that and more.",6,6,12,13 May 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," Good Reboot Despite Some Issues
","Reboot of the Spider-Man series without Sam Raimi is surprisingly good, even with its flaws. It's a little more emo than I would prefer my Spider-Man. It also suffers from a sense of familiarity, being an origin story released ten years after the first movie already did that. Of course, they change a lot between that version and this but the gist is the same. I will say that no 'With great power comes great responsibility' is a huge fail. On the plus side, it has a great cast. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have a believable, likable chemistry. Garfield's Peter is a bit more of a jerk than I am used to seeing or reading, but I will chalk that up to them trying to make him more 'real.' Realism is the enemy of fantasy but unfortunately, many filmmakers who tackle comic book movies don't get this. The direction is nice, especially considering Mark Webb is new to this kind of movie-making. The effects are so-so but the movie takes place mostly at night, which is a convenient way for them to utilize spotty CGI. Unfortunately, that also lends to the overall dark tone the film has. I don't view Spider-Man as a dark character so the navel-gazing gets old after awhile. Still, if you're a fan of comic book movies and Spider-Man in particular, I doubt you'll regret watching this.",7,0,1,30 June 2014
The Lego Movie," 'Don't forget Taco Tuesday's coming next week.'
","I'm an old fart as far as this Lego thing is concerned. I remember them from when I was a kid, of course, but that was before they started doing all the stuff with them that they do now. In my day you could just build buildings with them. Not really special buildings either, just ordinary stuff. We also used to tie onions on our belts because that was the style at the time, but I'll leave that story for Grampa Simpson to tell. Anyway, the voicework is great. I especially liked Morgan Freeman as Vitruvius. The story is surprisingly pretty good. I was expecting something kind of dumb but it's actually a fun movie and smarter than I thought it would be. It's something both kids and adults can enjoy. Oh, and I thought the double decker couch was a good idea. Sue me.",7,2,4,8 June 2014
The Exorcist," Horror Classic
","William Friedkin delivers a highly effective horror film that's still powerful after all this time. I just watched it for the first time in about ten years. While not as scary as it was the first time, I was able to appreciate the filmmaking behind it even more. Years of exorcism movies have followed and all borrow from this film. It's undoubtedly one of the most influential horror films of the last fifty years. Possibly second only to Night of the Living Dead. Regrettably, all of the imitators will dilute the original somewhat for a lot of viewers. Especially younger viewers.The cast is great. Several were nominated for Academy Awards. Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, and Lee J. Cobb are all solid. Max Von Sydow gives a distinguished and understated performance. Linda Blair, in her career-defining role, is excellent. Unfortunately, she is seldom given much credit these days. This is due to the fact that her voice was dubbed during the possessed sequences. I don't feel this is particularly fair since her performance outside of the possession scenes is quite good and during those scenes she is still acting, despite the later dubbing of her lines.Anyway, there's not much I can add that hasn't already been covered in great detail by other reviewers. It's a seminal horror film and I can't imagine anyone who is a fan of horror not seeing it. Taking it a step further, it's just a great film overall that I think transcends its genre.",9,2,4,30 December 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Just because the X-Men series stumbled and lost its path doesn't mean it can't be saved
","Great marriage of the first two X-Men films with First Class. Its primary function is as a sequel to First Class but it also works as a clean-up of the mess made with Last Stand. That the series has rebounded from that film and now 'fixed' itself is surely a cinematic miracle. Hugh Jackman continues to be the backbone of this franchise. I really can't predict what will happen when he's too old to continue in the part and they have to recast. I'm not looking forward to it, for sure. Let's hope that is many years off. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen step back into their old roles seamlessly. Both are perfect as always. It was nice to see Halle Berry and the others return. The First Class crew (McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, Hoult) are all excellent actors and do well just as they did in that film.The new characters are good, especially Evan Peters' Quicksilver, but it would have been nice if some of the old gang had been given more to do. I like that Storm and Iceman got some action and I understand why the others who appear at the end were only there briefly but poor Rogue was left to a two-second cameo. That's just sad when you consider how important she was to the start of this series. It would have been cool, considering the future angle, if they could have shown her for once being more like the Rogue from the comics. I think most fans would have gladly sacrificed a mort like Warpath to get that. I also shouldn't complain that Rebecca Romijn had no cameo considering she had one in First Class, but still it would have been a nice bonus. But these are minor quibbles with an otherwise very entertaining movie.The special effects, action, and music were all well-done. The script was very smart and although I'm sure I could find some holes if I tried, the effort to keep a sense of continuity in this series despite its missteps is certainly appreciated. I was skeptical before the film for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that they were loosely adapting one of my favorite comic book stories and I didn't want to see it besmirched. What they wound up doing resembles the comic story only in name and using time travel as a plot device. Everything else is different. But I'm okay with that. I value the comic story for what it was and this for what it is. Bryan Singer's triumphant return puts him at 3-0 in X-Men movies. Hopefully he makes more of them as it's clearly material he connects with and is good at.",7,1,5,31 May 2014
Independence Day," 'Let's nuke the bastards.'
","1950s style UFO invasion movie updated as a '90s blockbuster. It's undeniably fun and exciting. The cast is excellent, in particular Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaid, and Judd Hirsch, who all bring much-appreciated humor. The special effects are great and the action scenes are well-done. It's a quintessential 'big dumb summer blockbuster' type of movie. This, of course, means it is panned by elitists and film snobs. This isn't a smart movie, nor does it try to be. But it also isn't so dumb that it insults the audience. The purpose of this movie is pure popcorn entertainment and there's nothing wrong with that. Just relax and enjoy yourself for a couple of hours and change. You might even learn something you can use in the event of a future alien invasion.",7,2,4,1 August 2014
Non-Stop," When a Stranger Texts
","Entertaining but requires a strong suspension of disbelief. Liam Neeson is great but isn't he always? They do a pretty good job with the red herrings, even if I guessed it a little earlier than I was probably supposed to. Well, I figured this person had something to do with it, whether they were THE bad guy or just an accomplice. But they did keep me guessing at least about whether they were in it alone or not. The motive behind all of it seemed a little forced, as well. I got the feeling the writers wanted to get far more political with it than they were allowed to. I'm willing to bet there was an earlier draft that was much whinier and soapboxier. What's in the finished product is nothing to get worked up over, though. It's a decent time-killer. For those wondering, the poster shot of Neeson leaping through the air firing his gun on the plane actually does occur in the movie. It's the timing of when it occurs that is the most priceless part. Oh, and since when are flattops back in style? Nate Parker looked like Theo Huxtable in this.",6,0,1,7 June 2014
The Princess Bride," 'This is true love - you think this happens every day?'
","One of my favorite movies. Probably in my top five all-time favorites. Funny, quotable, with many memorable characters and one perfect scene after another. Just absolutely charming. Solid direction from Rob Reiner. Perhaps not as flashy as some would prefer but straightforward and not distracting like it probably would be if made today. William Goldman wrote the screenplay, as well as the original book. I've read the book and I recommend you go check it out after seeing the film. There are a lot of little funny bits that didn't make it to the screen. The cast is excellent, from perhaps the prettiest couple in movie history (Cary Elwes and Robin Wright) to one of the funniest supporting casts ever (including Chris Sarandon, Mandy Patinkin, Billy Crystal, Wallace Shawn, Christopher Guest, Peter Falk, Peter Cook, Carol Kane, and a wonderful turn from pro wrestling legend Andre the Giant). It's a classic for young and old alike and I can't say enough good things about it. Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles... it's got everything.",10,4,6,21 June 2016
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Watchable but disappointing
","Hiccup tries to stop a war with a bad guy named Drago who wants to control all dragons. Hiccup also finds out his mom isn't dead, she's just terrible. The first half is light and enjoyable. Second half descends into darkness with the senseless killing of Stoick. What, because Hiccup's deadbeat mom is back it's okay to kill off his dad? How depressing! For me, the movie never recovers from this huge downer. The animation is pretty and even better than the first movie. The returning characters are all likable, although Hiccup grates on my nerves at times. But I felt that way about him in the first one, as well. I didn't care for the mom at all. Less said about that the better. Also the whole preachy peace message is undermined by all the violence and the fact that peace is only achieved at the end by having superior firepower. Mixed messages much? If you liked How to Train Your Dragon you'll probably like this. But be ready for it to have some flaws that might bother some more than others.",5,13,28,23 November 2014
It Follows," Great movie
","A young woman has sex with a guy she barely knows and finds that she is now followed by a supernatural entity that takes on many forms but is invisible to anyone who hasn't been 'cursed.' I was really happy to see this and have some proof that creative horror isn't completely dead. Mostly dead maybe but not completely. If I had to see one more found footage movie or another subpar remake of a classic, I would scream. This is a very cool and very creepy little horror movie that feels retro in some ways while still being fresh and clever. Good cast, script, and direction. Love the music score by Rich Vreeland (I refuse to call him by that stupid pseudonym). I just can't imagine the movie being anywhere near as effective without his score. I like that this doesn't give the viewer all the answers and leaves us with some mystery. I know there will probably be a crappy sequel someday that will explain it all away and ruin the whole thing but I really hope, for once, they can leave well enough alone.I do have a few quibbles, mostly about the second half. The main gripe being the decision to make the 'it' of the title something that can be physically touched and hurt. This seems like a misstep that most likely came about because director/writer David Robert Mitchell couldn't think of another way to end the story. To me, it worked better when 'it' was an incorporeal phantom rather than an invisible shapeshifting creature. It didn't ruin the movie for me but it did contribute to a somewhat underwhelming climax considering how good the buildup was. Despite that, this is a fine atmospheric horror movie; one of the best the genre has seen in years. Definitely recommended for people who want more than 'guts & gore' from their horror.",7,6,14,27 July 2015
Frozen," I like warm hugs too
","Story of two princesses. The eldest, Elsa, becomes queen but she has snow powers for some reason...I guess she was born that way. So she's kind of sad about that. The younger is Anna and she's the goofy but lovably cute girl movies have told us time and again are the best kind. The two sisters argue and Elsa uses her powers in front of everybody. This freaks them out so Elsa runs away. The bulk of the plot is about Anna trying to find her sister and bring her home.Frozen is a good movie but not a great one. It's very loosely adapted from Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Snow Queen.' The theme of sisterly love is nice but the movie didn't really spend a lot of time building that up. It seems like it's there at the beginning and at the end but the middle is made up of focus on other characters. Most of the movie plays out like a rehash of tried & true Disney tropes mixed with clichés from romantic comedies. There's nothing inherently wrong with that and it does work for the most part. The snowman character is the most entertaining but he seems entirely tacked on to the plot. The music is OK if a little too Broadway for my tastes. The animation is very nice. The voicework pretty good. It's not a bad movie and I'm sure kids and young women will like it even more than I did.",6,17,30,20 January 2014
X-Men: The Last Stand," 'Since when did we become a disease?'
","Following up the first two excellent X-Men films from Bryan Singer is this mess from the awful Brett Ratner. The plot's about a battle between the X-Men and evil mutants led by Magneto because humans have discovered a way to turn mutants back into regular people...or something like that. There are subplots out the wazoo but these are mostly distractions that do nothing to help the main story; they just add to the confusion. It's a movie built around the premise of a super-powered battle. Everything else is just padding. The action scenes are pedestrian and the special effects are all over the place quality-wise. Ratner's direction is workmanlike, as anyone who's seen his other movies will expect. The reason why I don't rank this one lower is because of the cast. The returning favorites like Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen are so good in their roles I would watch them regardless of how bad the rest of it is. The new characters are hit and miss with the standouts being Kelsey Grammar as Beast and Ben Foster as Angel. The worst are the new villains ('I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!). Also, bigger roles for some characters introduced in the second movie is nice. Brett Ratner shoves as many characters into this as he can, no doubt in an effort to appease the fanboy audience. It's too bad they don't have better material to work with. It's not a good movie, although it is watchable for fans. Weakest of the series by far.",5,1,2,12 October 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Surprisingly Blah Remake
","The 1947 Walter Mitty film, starring Danny Kaye with an excellent supporting cast, was a Technicolor gem about a man who escaped from his life through fanciful daydreams. This 2013 remake borrows the bare bones of the plot but takes away most of the humor and all of the color, leaving a rather drab, serious midlife crisis movie. The pace is surprisingly slow and the tone mostly somber. There are funny parts here and there. The Benjamin Button parody is the best of all of the fantasy sequences, which isn't saying a lot. A criticism of the original movie was that its daydream sequences went on too long and there were too many of them. That's definitely not the case here. The daydreams are too brief and not interesting enough, with the exception of one or two. Also, there's a curious lack of soundtrack throughout. Perhaps it was just the slow pace that made it stand out more but there were lengthy stretches with no music that just added to the overall blah tone of the film. The movie looks like a rainy day. It's way too serious to be a good comedy and not deep enough to be a good drama.",5,1,2,4 May 2014
22 Jump Street," 'Lambos are lame.'
","I had very low expectations for the 21 Jump Street movie but found it to be surprisingly good. So I looked forward to this sequel and, for the most part, I wasn't disappointed. It starts off strong but does lose some steam around the hour mark. It really should have been ninety minutes instead of nearly two hours but no one likes to trim the fat in movies these days. Speaking of fat, ever since 'losing' all that weight, Jonah Hill appears to be aging faster. He looks forty-five here but they wisely write that into the script. Particularly in the form of insults toward Hill from Jillian Bell. She's the funniest part of the movie, by the way. Anyway, it's a pretty good comedy. Hill and Channing Tatum both do fine. Ice Cube gets more to work with this time. Lots of in-jokes and self-deprecating humor to go around. If you liked the first movie, you should enjoy this one.",6,1,3,31 October 2014
The Longest Day," 'I tell you, there are some pretty peculiar blokes on this beach.'
","The epic war movie to end all epic war movies, The Longest Day is producer Darryl F. Zanuck's salute to those involved in the Invasion of Normandy. It's a riveting film that recreates the events leading up to D-Day for the Americans, the British, the French, and the Germans. It's told in great detail with more historical accuracy than is usual for a movie based on real people and events (then or now). It helps that it was filmed on location in many of the real places and used military consultants, both Allied and Axis, who had actually been involved in D-Day. The cast features many big names such as John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, and so many others it'd take the whole review just to list them. I can honestly say that, despite the huge cast, every actor involved does solid work. No one was phoning it in or hamming it up in this one. The special effects and beautiful black & white cinematography both deservedly won Oscars. It's a remarkable film that holds up very well after all these years and stands as the premier war movie of its kind. One of the last great WWII movies made by people who lived through it, the greatest generation.",9,2,4,20 September 2015
X-Men: Apocalypse," Huge disappointment
","I had a lot of praise for the last X-Men film, which restored my hopes for the franchise. But this is a huge letdown in pretty much every way. This one takes place in the 1980s, following Days of Future Past (1970s) and First Class (1960s). Unfortunately no effort is made to show any aging for the characters who should be in their 40s or 50s at this point. They all look the same. Mystique we can overlook because of her power to change appearance but Professor X, Magneto, Beast, Moira MacTaggert, and (worst of all) Havok all look the same as they did in the film that took place in the '60s. To some viewers (and undoubtedly Singer and company) this might seem like no big deal, but to me it's annoying and points to a general lack of concern about the continuity of the films. Whenever I feel like filmmakers can't be bothered to care, I lose interest in the product.The continuity issues don't end there but they are just one of the many problems with this. You have an ill-defined and goofy-looking villain in Apocalypse, a towering and imposing figure in the comics that is played here by wimpy 5'9' Oscar Isaac in a poorly realized getup. He looks silly, to be honest. Far too silly to be taken seriously as a villain. The script does little to explain who he is and what motivates him. It's yet another example of an increasingly irritating trend in comic book movies these days, where the filmmakers act like every person watching is an avid fanboy/girl that has read every comic, seen every interview, and keeps up with all the news surrounding the production of a movie. It's lazy and I'm pretty sick of it.Most of the cast is fine but there are no standouts. Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, and Nicholas Hoult seem bored by it all. James McAvoy at least appears to be trying but even he is going through the motions at this point. Evan Peters repeats his performance as Quicksilver from the last film but the new has worn off some and it's less fun than it was the first go-round. Of the newbies, Kodi Smit-McPhee as Nighcrawler probably fares best. Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan, as Jean Grey and Cyclops, are inoffensive but dull. Ben Hardy is a forgettable Angel. Olivia Munn is wooden as Psylocke and dressed like some cosplayer. Alexandra Shipp shows potential as Storm but she's ultimately wasted in this.It's not a good movie but it's not something unwatchable, either. Bryan Singer's first misstep in the series. It's just frustrating to someone who enjoys the X-Men movies overall and wants the best for the franchise. The continuity errors, weak script, unimpressive new cast members, and pedestrian direction all do this one in. The climax is the movie's only action scene worth mentioning and even it's pretty blah. The sad thing is the highlight of this is Hugh Jackman's cameo, which is just a few minutes out of a two and a half hour movie. I don't know where the series will go from here with all the talk about most of the big names in the cast not returning in the future. The newbies introduced in this do little to instill confidence. Hopefully they take some time and get a great script next time. If not, this series is in a lot of trouble.",5,3,8,4 July 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Would Have Been So Much Better Without Jamie Foxx
","Good but not great sequel that manages to improve upon some things but, like the first movie, still has quite a few bugs. First, the good. Peter is far more likable in this movie. He's fun, he cracks more jokes, and seems more in line with the way Spider-Man should be portrayed. The cast is mostly solid. Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, and Sally Field all return from the first movie and shine. Dane DeHaan is very good as Harry Osborn, although the movie would have been better served with just him as the villain and giving him more screen time to build up his relationship with Peter. The action is much improved over the first movie, with some very impressive sequences that stand out. I can't recall a notable action scene from the first movie. I also loved the ending to this one. It was perfect.Now, the bad. Let's start with friggin' Electro, played by Jamie Foxx. Ugh what kind of crap is this? I wonder if this is yet another case of the studio forcing them to add another villain to the movie, afraid audiences would be bored otherwise. Foxx's performance is embarrassingly bad. He seems like he would be more at home in a Joel Schumacher Batman movie. They also give him goofy music in the first part of the film like Otis from Superman (78). Terrible. I hated the look of the character, as well. All too often Hollywood's crappy designers think they can improve upon costumes and appearances of characters from comic books that have lasted for decades. Well, they're wrong 99% of the time and here Electro is yet another example of that. Not to mention Rhino, but I'll let that slide. The video game climax was a bit much, with the CGI Spider-Man looking so cartoony I thought the movie had turned into an animated film for awhile. Lastly, something I didn't like from this or the first movie is the stupid plot involving Peter's parents. I don't think it was necessary and ultimately added very little to either movie.I still recommend the movie because parts of it are excellent and overall the movie works, despite the problems with Foxx and some of the other issues. It strikes a nice balance between light and dark, even better than the first movie did. I just wish they wouldn't keep thinking that superhero sequels had to have multiple villains, especially cheesy ones.",6,2,9,30 June 2014
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Watchable But Disappointing
","Another disappointing Fantastic Four movie. The returning cast is fine, I guess, considering how the characters are written. Johnny's a bit more of a jerk, Ben's a bit dumber, and Reed has a stupid dance scene that should have resulted in someone being fired. But most of that is the script and direction, not the actors. For her part, Jessica Alba portrays Sue as less of a ditz this time around. Although the ridiculous blue contacts are distracting and unnecessary. Julian McMahon is back as someone they're calling Dr. Doom. They conveniently find a reason to allow him to act without a mask or makeup. Andre Braugher has a thankless role as a clichéd Army general with an ax to grind with Reed.The special effects are spotty. Sometimes they are passable, sometimes dreadful, but never are they great. The Silver Surfer is a CGI character interacting with flesh & blood actors in a real-world environment and the tech just wasn't there in 2007 to pull that off convincingly. At all times, you are very aware that he is fake. It's like having a cartoon mixed in with real people, a la Roger Rabbit. This is not the fault of Doug Jones or Laurence Fishburne. The biggest disappointment is in the presentation of Galactus. They obviously didn't have the budget to do Galactus properly so instead we get some vague cloud entity thing. It's the kind of thing comic book fans learned to expect from television shows like Smallville with limited resources, not a major film release.This movie is a real disservice to the original Lee & Kirby Galactus story, perhaps the best of all Fantastic Four stories. It highlights a fundamental problem with Tim Story's Fantastic Four movies. For what he gets right about the characters (the family dynamic, some of the characterizations, a lighter tone), he gets more wrong. There is never a sense of the fantastic about these films. They don't explore anything, nor do they introduce new characters, worlds, and ideas in any kind of impressive way. They're just people with super powers doing stuff. With very little effort, you could change the names and powers of the characters and not alter the story in any significant way. On the positive side, the movie does have a lot of humor and the main cast are likable actors all. I just wish they had been given a decent script and a serious attempt at making a quality FF movie instead of this. It's watchable but nothing better than that.",5,1,3,30 May 2014
Grudge Match," Grumpy Old Men
","I'm honestly being kind with a score of 5. It's not a movie I can ever see myself watching again, that's for sure. The premise, which no doubt resulted in much back-patting for someone, is that two older actors who starred in classic boxing movies play two old boxers with a score to settle. It's one of those movies where the last moment anybody cared about putting any creative effort into this was when they came up with the concept. After that it was just a matter of phoning it in and collecting a paycheck.The chemistry between Robert DeNiro and Sylvester Stallone is decent and results in a few amusing lines back and forth before the novelty of that wears off. Their appeal is what carries the film. If you're not a fan of either actor, you may as well skip this. The romantic chemistry between Stallone and Kim Basinger is nonexistent. Kevin Hart is funny for a second or two until you realize he's only bringing that same old tired shtick of his to the table - every other sentence is 'white this' or 'black that.' Yawn. The little kid playing DeNiro's grandson is annoyingly precocious so prepare yourself for that. On the plus side, Alan Arkin easily steals every scene he's in and Jon Bernthal is ideal casting as DeNiro's son.The movie meanders a great deal and is pretty predictable throughout. Some emotional scenes in this don't register well because you will find yourself disliking so many of the characters. There are also some glaring plot holes such as how Sly's character was medically cleared to fight when he's blind in one eye. The movie even jokes early on about the old guys passing medical exams, but when an actual medical issue figures into the plot nothing is ever said about how he ever passed the physical exam in the first place! Also, how terrible was the use of CGI in this? The early scenes showing footage of the two men fighting in their prime was so fake it was disturbing. Then, with the Dancing with the Stars joke at the end, DeNiro's face was clearly CGI'd onto someone else's body. Just creepy. Anyway, it's not a good movie but it is watchable if you are a fan of the stars. It's never as much fun as you hope it will be but it has moments here and there.",5,3,4,23 August 2015
Event Horizon," 'F*** this ship!'
","A spaceship called Event Horizon returns after disappearing years before. A rescue ship investigates and finds evil. Evil, I tell you! A good sci-fi horror flick that has improved with age. I like it more now than I did when it was first released. It's a movie that borrows so liberally from everything from The Black Hole and Alien to Hellraiser that it leaves itself open to charges of theft. It also uses a formula that has been done to death -- the motley crew of a ship (space or sea -- doesn't matter) encountering some dangerous creature or force. That formula was never better than in Alien, although its roots go at least as far back as the 1950s sci-fi boom. So with the film's creative bankruptcy, why do I still rate it as high as I do? Basically because it does its job very well. It's an entertaining movie with few artistic pretenses. The cast is good for this kind of movie where there's usually at least one person hamming it up so badly they bring the whole movie down with them. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill are the standouts but the entire cast is solid. The special effects and sets are not too shabby. It's one of director Paul W.S. Anderson's better movies, not that that's saying a lot. I don't really have any superlatives to throw at Event Horizon, as it's not the best of anything really. Just an enjoyable genre movie that has some forgivable flaws.",7,1,1,17 October 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Pelvic sorcery saves the galaxy
","Like a lot of other people, I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. To say it exceeded my expectations would be an understatement. It's a clever and fresh gem in the stable of Marvel films. One of the best they've put out so far. The script is full of funny lines but it's also got lots of good character stuff with earned emotional moments. The action and effects are nice. The cast is great, including those just doing voices. Chris Pratt does a wonderful job blending the comic relief with the superhero. The soundtrack of old pop songs is terrific and integrated into the plot perfectly. The homages to Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and more are fun. Which is the simplest and best word to describe this movie: fun. You'll have a blast watching it.",8,22,33,15 November 2014
Evil Dead," Hip Attractive Model Types Scared of Familiar Tropes Is What Passes For Horror These Days
","Shallow overblown remake of a low budget classic fails by its very nature as yet another 21st century 'all style no substance' remake. My biggest gripe with the movie (and others like it) is that it takes an inventive, creative, unique film with atmosphere and tension and turns it into yet another glossy uninspired 'pretty' movie that we get way too much of already. The movie tag line reads: the most terrifying film you will ever experience. What a joke. It's impossible to be frightened by these music video horror movies that remove you so far from reality with their overproduced visuals that you never feel a sense of dread or uneasiness. How is it scary watching a bunch of young models act poorly and mimic stuff we've seen in dozens of movies over the decades? In a comparison with the original film it fails completely. Judging it on its own (mostly borrowed) merits, it's as entertaining as your average generic slasher horror flick -- no scares but a sort of 'zone out and enjoy it' entertainment value. It borrows liberally from better films and offers nothing new of its own. The stuff it changes from the original Evil Dead movies is stuff that's ripped off from other sources, like The Exorcist. Look, it is what it is. A lot of dumb kids and those easily pleased will wet themselves with enjoyment over it. But that doesn't make it great. It's all very familiar and stale but...it's better than the Texas Chainsaw remake. I guess there's that!",5,1,2,28 November 2013
Jurassic World," 'Maybe progress should lose for once.'
","The fourth Jurassic Park film (and, given its success, not the last) is being hailed as the best since the original, with eyebrow-raising claims from some corners that it is as good as or even better than the original. Well that claim is patently absurd since this movie offers nothing unique of its own, but rather plays with the groundwork laid by the previous movies (particularly the first). Jurassic Park was an instant classic that had a little bit of everything. This one is just a very good movie and, yes, it's probably the best of the sequels so far. I did like the third one better than many did, however. The cast here is decent, with Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard both likable leads. The two little kids are kind of forgettable, though, and the character played by Vincent D'Onofrio is straight out of the Big Book of Clichéd Villains. The script is good with plenty of humor and nods to the first film. Michael Giacchino's rousing score is nice but tries a little too hard at times to match John Williams (an impossible task). What everyone watches a movie like this for is the dinosaur action and this has that in spades. We get regular dinos and souped-up genetically engineered hybrid dinos, as well as the fan favorite velociraptors figuring into things in a clever way. The special effects are great and the monster fight climax is kick-ass. If you go into it with just the expectation of being entertained, you'll have fun watching it. If you go in expecting to be 'wowed' like you were with the first Jurassic Park, then you'll probably be a little underwhelmed by it. It's a good movie but it doesn't offer much that it can call its own.",7,9,21,12 October 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," 'Cap, I have to blow up the city!'
","The Avengers bicker with each other while trying to battle Ultron, an artificial intelligence in a robot shell created by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner. Given the astronomical success of the first film, it was almost a certainty this sequel would pale by comparison. I did enjoy this one but I must admit it doesn't hold a candle to The Avengers, Winter Soldier, or any of the first solo movies that I liked so much. The main thing the first Avengers had going for it was the spectacle of these characters teaming up on screen for the first time. It was a delight for longtime fans and for those following the movies to see such a wonderful payoff. This doesn't have that going for it. It's the same set of characters, with a few new additions I actually liked more than some of the previous characters. James Spader provides the voice for Ultron and does a magnificent job of being both menacing and funny. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and lovely Elizabeth Olsen are very good as Pietro and Wanda Maximoff (aka Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch), although their costumes are unimaginative. Paul Bettany, who has been providing the voice for Tony Stark's A.I. companion Jarvis in the previous movies, is upgraded to his own character here -- The Vision, who steals the movie as soon as he shows up.As with the first Avengers, the character stuff is what makes this work. There's especially good material for Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner. With this cast and how well they mesh together, there's a ceiling on how bad this could possibly be and this, thankfully, doesn't approach bad at any time. Whedon's script, while still having some good lines and scenes, was a little unbalanced and doesn't have quite the punch he is capable of. The action set pieces aren't the most impressive I've ever seen (even within the Marvel films) but they are mostly entertaining and the final battle against Ultron and his robot army has some moments of greatness. One thing did bug me due to how frequently it happened -- how were the people who don't have superhuman strength punching and kicking metal that's stronger than steel without being hurt? A bit of nerdy hole-poking, perhaps, but it didn't make sense.My experience watching this several months ago (and now rewatching it for the first time since) is very different from my experience with The Avengers. With the prior film, I was influenced by the massive hype and expectations to the point that it hurt my enjoyment of the movie the first go-round. I have since come to appreciate it much more and really just love it for the sheer fun that it is. This movie I found myself liking a lot upon first viewing but my second viewing found my opinion dropping quite a bit as I noticed a lot more of what was wrong with it. Look, it's an enjoyable movie but not as clever or fun as it should have been. Not the stinker some are making it out to be but definitely a bit of a disappointment.",6,4,11,1 October 2015
Big Fish," 'There are some fish that cannot be caught.'
","A lovely, touching film that has only gotten better over time. Big Fish has many detractors, even among people who are normally big fans of Tim Burton. I wonder if these people expect that every film he does should look the same? Because by the time Big Fish came out, he was frankly in a rut. I think it's his most unique film and certainly one of his best. The performances by the cast are all excellent, particularly the supporting players. As the present-day Edward and Sandra, Albert Finney and Jessica Lange are every bit as good as you would expect from these vets. As the younger Ed and Sandra, Ewan McGregor and Alison Lohman both hold their own, though Lohman gets little to do. McGregor's Southern accent is a little over the top but this is a story about a man who was over the top so it doesn't really hurt anything. The rest of the cast is great. The look of the film is superb. I do wish he could have made it without much CGI (the 'big fish,' for example, looked extremely fake). But I realize that I'm fighting an uphill battle asking that of mainstream directors these days. Anyway, great film. Heartfelt and magical. A tribute to storytellers. It's also the film debut of Miley Cyrus but we'll forgive it for that.",8,0,0,17 June 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick's Masterpiece
","What can I really say about one of the greatest films of all time that hasn't been said already? The first time I saw it as a teenager I was left amazed at what I had seen but at the same time confused as to what it all meant. This was the first movie I saw that didn't spell everything out for me. It took time for me to learn to enjoy that. It's a beautiful film. I've heard it described as visual poetry and I think that is as accurate a way of putting it as anything else. The visuals are stunning. The special effects, sets, costumes are all first-rate. I recently watched it with my girlfriend who had never seen it and has tastes that are strictly mainstream. She was in awe of the look of the film, particularly given its age. Not enough good things can be said about Kubrick's use of classical music in this, as well. It's a masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it's received. Obviously a film that every serious film fan has to see. It might not be to everybody's tastes but it's an experience unlike any other and, in my opinion, worth repeated viewings. For those of you interested, there's obviously the Arthur C. Clarke books that are worth reading but I'm also going to recommend you check out the Jack Kirby 2001 comics. They're trippy and lots of fun!",10,2,4,21 June 2014
Up," Outstanding
","What a wonderful heartwarming story. My favorite Pixar movie. The opening ten minutes or so is as perfect as any other movie I can think of. This is that rare film that appeals to people of all ages. It's beautifully animated with some excellent voicework and a smart script. It hits every emotional note just right. I never felt it went too far or stooped too low to get a reaction, as so many films like this tend to do. It's one of the more honest tearjerkers I've ever seen, animated or not. Easily one of my favorite movies from the last ten years. A modern classic that holds up well against the Disney greats from decades past. That's no small compliment from me, as I love those films.",9,1,2,21 May 2014
The Fly," 'Drink deep or taste not the plasma spring! See what I'm saying?'
","Scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is working on creating a machine that can teleport objects from one place to another. He shares his work with reporter Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) and the two quickly enter into a relationship, both romantic and professional. Veronica intends to write about Seth's invention once it's complete. One night Seth tests the teleporter out on himself, with seemingly fine results at first. But, as things start happening to his body, Seth discovers a fly was also in the teleporter when he tested it out which has resulted in him slowly turning into a human/fly hybrid.I'm not the biggest David Cronenberg fan but I do enjoy many of his films, none more so than this excellent remake of the 1950s classic The Fly. It's not as charming or colorful as the original due to the different eras in which they were made. It's certainly a whole lot grosser (understatement of the century). But it's also smart, creative, and fun in its way. It's one of the best sci-fi or horror movies of the '80s. Jeff Goldblum gives a wonderfully energetic performance. I've read some other reviewers refer to this movie as depressing. I suppose from a story perspective you might argue that but I can't see how anyone could be depressed with Goldblum's liveliness. Even as he begins morphing into 'Brundlefly,' he's still full of energy and a commanding presence that keeps you glued to the screen. Too many times actors inhibited by makeup or prosthetics seem to give up, letting the effects do all the work while they just read lines. But not Goldblum here. Gotta respect that. Other than Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park, this is my favorite role of Goldblum's. Geena Davis does an admirable job with a less inspired part. She is attractive and has a great chemistry with Goldblum (the two married the following year). The romance in the film is a little rushed but that's fairly common with movies where the romance is only a secondary plot point. Geena does manage to pull off the 'Be afraid. Be very afraid.' line with a straight face, which is more than many could do.Chris Walas' makeup effects deservedly won an Oscar. As I said before, the movie is gross in places. More gross than perhaps it needs to be. But the effects are exceptional throughout. Whatever gross thing Cronenberg wanted, the effects team knocked it out of the park. Howard Shore's wonderful score also deserves some praise. And, of course, Cronenberg's superb direction. It's an intense and intelligent take on the old 'mad scientist' films that used to define a large part of horror and science fiction. In the later part of the twentieth century, you didn't see a lot of those movies. Certainly not as many thirty or forty years before. This is one of the best remakes of a classic film I've ever seen.",7,2,3,28 June 2015
Rocky," 'I ain't no bum, Mick. I ain't no bum.'
","A first-rate film that's about as close to perfect as any movie about boxing (or any other sport) that I've ever seen. The plot is very simple -- small-time boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is given a chance to fight the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). It sounds no different than a ton of old movies about the sport. But this film proves that it's not always how fresh or unique the story is but how well it's crafted. Rocky is a masterpiece of filmmaking with dynamite acting from Sylvester Stallone, Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Carl Weathers. Many classic scenes, lines, characters. Bill Conti's score is one of the all-time greats. It was nominated for nine Oscars, winning three including Best Picture. It was director John G. Avildsen's best film and many would argue it is Stallone's best as well. Certainly his best screenplay. The fight choreography is terrific. Followed by a string of enjoyable sequels but they were just solid entertainment. This one is very entertaining but it is also something much more than that. It's one of those movies that becomes part of culture in a big way where everybody recognizes something from the film even if they've never seen it.",10,3,3,6 July 2015
Rocky III," 'I pity the fool.'
","The Rocky series stumbles a bit in this third movie. Sylvester Stallone once again writes and directs the film, in addition to starring. The plot has Rocky becoming rich, famous, and beloved as he defends the championship successfully in one bout after another. Then a hungry up-and-comer named Clubber Lang (Mr. T) publicly challenges Rocky, who accepts despite the reservations of his trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith).A good popcorn movie but the first of the series to feel like that's all it's striving to be. Mr. T is fun but hard to take seriously. Hulk Hogan has a comedy appearance as 'Thunder Lips,' a wrestler Rocky has to fight in a charity event. This whole part is silly and kind of out of place with the rest of the movie. Nice to see most of the regulars back, including a smooth way of fitting Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed back into the story. Bill Conti's score is good but what most people remember from this one is Survivor's hit song 'Eye of the Tiger.' Not a bad movie in any way but a step down from part two.",6,3,4,6 July 2015
Thor," Whosoever holds this hammer...
","Growing up, I was a huge Thor fan. It was my favorite comic book. I never came across anybody else who liked it that much though. Over the years as more comic movies started being made, I held out hope maybe one day Thor would be brought to the big screen in a respectable movie. Finally that happened with Kenneth Branagh's Thor. This is an excellent movie with drama, romance, humor, and action. It's quite simply one of the best Marvel has put out so far and a personal favorite of mine. For comic fans, yes they change a few things but they keep the heart of the story and characters intact. As one lifelong Thor fan, I have no complaints. He's a character many said for years would be impossible to sell a movie about. But those people have been proved wrong. There's not much else I can add except to echo the sentiments of many other reviewers that the cast is great, the special effects are solid, and the story is smart and fun.",8,1,2,13 February 2014
The Godfather: Part III," For the Love of Money
","Let's be honest: this movie wasn't needed. It doesn't detract from the first two movies but it wasn't something Coppola should have made. It's not a terrible movie but obviously in the shadow of the first two, it looks like a complete turd. It doesn't have any of the iconic scenes those movies did. There's really only one remotely memorable line and that's Pacino's 'Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in' line. The acting is mostly fine but nothing to write home about. The worst is Sofia Coppola, in a textbook case of nepotism in casting. She's terrible and doesn't 'look' like she belongs. It's like taking somebody off the street and sticking them in a Hollywood production. Even if they are attractive, they just don't fit somehow. It's a watchable enough movie but not a great one by any stretch. Like I said, it didn't need to be made. Why was it? Well The O'Jays had a song called 'For the Love of Money' that pretty well covers that.",5,1,3,16 August 2014
It's a Wonderful Life," My Favorite Movie
","It's Christmas Eve in the town of Bedford Falls and George Bailey, a man who has spent his entire life sacrificing for others, is thinking of taking his life. Knowing George is in trouble, though perhaps not the extent, his family and friends pray that God help him. And that's exactly what He does -- in the form of an angel named Clarence. Throughout the bulk of the film, Clarence is brought up to date on George's life (as are the viewers). From childhood to adulthood, he sees that George has been a heroic noble soul, giving until it hurts and then giving some more. In order to save George, Clarence must show him what an impact he has had on the world and those he loves. James Stewart's performance is flawless. One of the core strengths of the film is how it covers so much emotional ground. From happy to sad to angry to loving, Stewart masters it all. He's an actor who appeared in virtually every kind of film and that helps here as he has to handle drama, romance, comedy, fantasy...even a little action thrown in for good measure. His performance in this film is my earliest recollection as a child of being in awe of an actor.Lionel Barrymore gives a career-defining performance here. For generations to come, he would be remembered as the villainous Mr. Potter. He had a storied career, full of so many different parts and very few of them were bad guys. One of his best roles was the gruff but lovable and wise Dr. Gillespie in the Dr. Kildare series for MGM. So it's kind of ironic that Barrymore is best known for portraying a thoroughly rotten man. But that's the talent of the man. He breathed life into Potter and made him so hissable.Such a great cast. The wonderful Henry Travers has his career-defining role, as well. Who doesn't love Clarence Odbody, AS2 (Angel Second Class)? The heavenly Donna Reed. She positively glows in this film. As a kid watching I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. I think it again every time I watch this movie. Ward Bond and Frank Faylen as the ORIGINAL Bert & Ernie. Gloria Graham as the sultry Violet Bick. Samuel S. HInds and Beulah Bondi as the Bailey parents. The amazing Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy. Who can forget H.B. Warner's moving performance as Mr. Gower? William Edmunds as Martini and Sheldon Leonard as Nick the bartender. Todd Karns as Harry Bailey. And all those wonderful child actors playing the Bailey kids as well as those in the flashbacks. Just a perfect cast.Frank Capra, one of my absolute favorite filmmakers, does such a brilliant job at directing here. Amazing pace. The film never slows down but never feels rushed. He worked from a script that had many authors. Normally, this would be a terrible sign for a film and would almost certainly mean it was a disjointed mess. But that couldn't be further from the truth in this case. The script is tight, flawless even. Wonderful lines, memorable scenes. So many memorable scenes. It's hard to even pinpoint which to talk about because the entire movie is one classic scene after another. But I'll try. There are brilliant scenes like 'George Lassos the Moon,' the bank run, the childhood confrontation with a grieving Mr. Gower, or the wonderful ending. But here are two of my favorites. The phone call scene where George and Mary share a phone. Such a sensual, romantic scene as they give into their feelings. The prayer in the bar is such a moving scene. Stewart's performance is so powerful here it's criminal he didn't win an Oscar for this role. So many more unforgettable scenes I could mention.I think of it as the greatest film ever made. I know there are some who will knock that. I realize there are all kinds of technical and cultural reasons that this film or that is the greatest. Citizen Kane, for example. While I love Kane or the Godfather films or countless other contenders, most of them are purely dramatic works that don't have for me what this film has: compelling rewatchability. It's my favorite film. It's as simple as that. I have seen it countless times. It's a beautiful story with Dickensian touches. A charming, funny, dramatic, sentimental, romantic, uplifting movie that makes me happy.",10,4,9,25 December 2013
The Witch," One of the more interesting horror films in recent years
","Slow-burn horror movie about a Puritan family in 17th century New England trying to survive their harsh life in the wilderness while battling their own demons as well as dealing with the threat of a creepy witch in the nearby woods. It's certainly a great-looking movie with an authentic period feel. The performances are all excellent. Two of the biggest complaints I've read are that (a) it's boring and (b) the witch is real and not just a metaphor or something like some would prefer. To the first complaint I would say that those people should stick with their found footage garbage. To the second complaint, which is coming primarily from certain types of critics, I say I'm glad the witch is real. I understand the power of suggestion and I value psychological horror as much as the next person, but it seems like the majority of movies made about witches, particularly about them during this period, have been unsubtle studies of persecution and superstition. That's all well and good, and interesting in its own way, but this is scary because the threat is real and you know it's real the whole film. Yes the family is at each other's throats and the bulk of the tension and drama comes from that, but the witch and who she serves are also a big part of the film and provide some of the most terrifying scenes. It's not a perfect movie by any means but I give it props for trying to do something different than the glut of banal exorcism, slasher, found footage, torture porn, and poltergeist movies that fill the horror field nowadays.",7,4,10,21 June 2016
War of the Worlds," 'I'm dead set on living.'
","This is a surprisingly decent remake of the 1953 classic. I suppose it would be more accurate to say that it's another adaptation of H.G. Wells' novel rather than a remake of the older film. Although both movies change a lot of things from the novel, this one actually is the more faithful of the two, for those of you who are passionate about movies adapted from books being as close to the source material as possible. I'm not really one of those. I will only nitpick the changes a movie makes when they are moronic and vastly inferior to the book.The cast is mixed. Tom Cruise manages to be believable playing a blue collar guy, contrary to what some reviewers have said. Dakota Fanning is hard to dislike but her 'precocious child who talks like an adult' bit is a little on the annoying side. But nowhere near as annoying as Justin Chatwin as Cruise's angry son. We get it, kid. Your dad isn't the greatest. Well, you're a little old to be acting like such a brat so why not grow and shut up already? The special effects are terrific. Steven Spielberg does a good job building the suspense and tension throughout. It is a dark movie, so those going into it expecting a special effects blockbuster with humor, romance, and all that thrown in might be disappointed. But it's still a Spielberg movie so it's not exactly nihilistic. All in all, it's a good film. Not a great one and not as much fun as the George Pal film but still worth your time.",6,0,1,13 June 2014
Hercules," 'So did they give you a name along with all those rippling pectorals?'
","Lackluster Disney movie that tells the story of Hercules. The whole thing lacks creativity, calculatedly following the Disney formula to the letter. We have stupid comic relief sidekicks, cheesy songs, a clichéd story, and lots of dumb in-jokes and references. It's moderately well-made for what it is but 'what it is' is the problem. I thought the voice work was fine and the animation not bad (but nothing terribly impressive). The songs are really lame, including the insufferably corny 'Go the Distance.' Of the films that came out during Disney's Renaissance period, this is one of the worst. Not a terrible watch when viewed in a bubble but, if you've seen even a few Disney animated films before, this will seem very tired and unoriginal. The worst part of it all is that, despite all the action and comedy, it's incredibly dull.",5,5,14,14 January 2016
30 Days of Night," 'You ain't gonna eat me!'
","Sheriff Josh Hartnett tries to defend his isolated Alaskan town against a gang of vampires that strike during the annual period where the town experiences 30 days of night. A very cool idea for a horror movie, based on a comic book, that never quite reaches its potential. It's entertaining enough but not scary. Director David Slade cares more about action sequences of vampire attacks and people fighting them off than build a terrifying atmosphere. The movie has two basic speeds: too slow or too fast. It never manages to find a perfect balance.Josh Hartnett does a fine job despite seeming too young for the role of a sheriff that a whole town respects and looks to for leadership. Melissa George, Manu Bennett, and Mark Boone Junior are among the other 'good guys' that stand out. The vamps are led by Danny Huston, who is neither charismatic or frightening enough to make an impact. Ben Foster gives a wonderfully hammy turn as a Renfieldesque character who gets most of the movie's best lines. The direction is uninspired and I can't help but wonder how much better this could have been with a director at the helm with more style. Sam Raimi was one of the producers of this and I can only imagine how much more visually interesting the movie would've been had he directed it. It's an enjoyable movie but, like I said, I think it had potential to be something more. As it is, it's a nice popcorn horror flick with a decent cast and an interesting backdrop that goes on a little too long.",6,2,3,24 August 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Terrific
","Tom Cruise may not get much respect these days but, for my money, he's one of the most consistent actors that delivers entertaining movies. I can't recall the last Cruise movie I disliked. This one's a fun, smart sci-fi action movie. Parts of it remind me of other movies like Groundhog Day and Starship Troopers but it never strays into rip-off territory. Cruise is in top form. You either like him or you don't. Nothing about his performance here is likely to change your mind about him. Emily Blunt is beautiful, which seems to be a point of contention for some who feel she's too attractive for the role. One wonders if these same people have ever said 'that guy's too good-looking to be a believable action hero.' Doubtful. Regardless, she's great in the movie and has good chemistry with Cruise. Bill Paxton has a supporting part but he's always fun. He pretty much steals every scene he has. The action and special effects are good, although the designs for the aliens are a little on the unimaginative side. It isn't a big dumb Michael Bay movie, which I appreciated. The ending of the film won't please everybody but I liked it. It's a summer blockbuster that doesn't assume its audience is full of morons. It's one of the best movies I've seen this year.",7,1,3,11 October 2014
Bram Stoker's Dracula," 'The blood is the life... and it shall be mine.'
","Francis Ford Coppola's sumptuous retelling of a story that, frankly, has been told to death. It's one of the more fresh and inventive versions of the Dracula story that has ever been filmed. That isn't to say it's without flaws (the limited acting abilities of Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder, for example) but it has a lot going for it that few cinematic Draculas do. The script reworks and expands upon Stoker's tale in some brilliant ways, adding depth to the Dracula character that is largely missing from the novel. Gary Oldman's performance is wonderfully theatrical without going too far into camp territory. It's one of Coppola's best post-70s films. Possibly the best, in my opinion. Of course it doesn't match up to his classics from that decade but it is far more memorable than most of his efforts since. The visuals in this movie are simply stunning. The colors, the sets, the costumes, the effects, the editing are all remarkable. Wojciech Kilar's evocative score is deserving of more praise. This isn't the scariest Dracula movie ever made but it is one of the more interesting. It may wallow in its excesses at times and it is probably a tad longer than necessary, but it's a gorgeous film with so much going on in every scene that I never felt bored or uninvolved. Lugosi and Lee will always be paramount in my book but this Dracula has earned a special place in my heart over the years. It's a movie I revisit from time to time and I am always finding more things about it to enjoy.",7,1,2,29 August 2015
Jaws," Spielberg's Best
","What's there to say that hasn't been said in praise of this great film? Spielberg's classic about a great white shark terrorizing the small community of Amity Island. It's an effective powerhouse thriller with terrific direction and an iconic score by John Williams. It's based off of Peter Benchley's terrible novel. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw give the performances of their careers. Let's not forget the underrated Murray Hamilton as the Mayor. He brings sympathy to a part that most would have played as a straight-up mustache-twirling heavy. Despite all the variations and ripoffs through the years, Jaws hasn't been matched. That's because it's not just a movie about a killer shark. It's a movie about people. All of the imitators seem to forget that and just try to make a movie about a shark or bear or fill-in-the-blank-animal killing as many people as possible in gruesome ways. Today's CGI-addicted filmmakers could learn a thing or ten about storytelling from Jaws. It's definitely a classic and, in my opinion, easily Steven Spielberg's best film.",10,3,7,7 February 2014
Kong: Skull Island," 'That was an unconventional encounter.'
","Juvenile, clichÃ©-ridden CGI spectacle. Not a sincere moment in the whole thing. Just action and CGI cartoonery for the sake of it. Set in the 1970s but little effort is made to make it seem authentic to that era. Everything is too clean, too pretty, too modern. Textbook Hollywood polish. Seems like the only reason it's even set back then is to shoehorn in some anti-military angle that is out of tone with the rest of the story. None of the performances resonate. There's the occasional chuckle at some of the characters' lines but that's it. Once John C. Reilly shows up, it practically becomes a full-blown comedy.Lots of things don't make sense, like a giant squid in what appears to be a few feet of water. The special effects are so-so but nothing that reinvents the wheel. In some places they are outright bad. The designs for the skullcrawler creatures is very unimpressive. The movie advocates the Hollow Earth theory, which amused me to no end mainly because I know how that triggers some people. Another annoying thing is this gag that never works but is used more than once: a person suddenly discovers a part of their natural surroundings is actually a monster. 'Oh don't sit on that log' and such. It's a pathetic attempt at some kind of jump scare and they use it a few times. Ugh. All that being said, it's entertaining for what it is: dumb action movie with giant creatures. Go into it with that expectation and you'll probably be fine with it. Expect anything remotely intelligent and you'll have a bad two hours.",5,2,3,16 August 2017
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," 'Prepare to be amazed beyond all expectations.'
","My favorite Disney film. Obviously its historical importance can't be stressed enough but let's not overlook how wonderfully entertaining it is. If you like sweet, colorful fairy tale stories, it doesn't get much better than this. There are lots of memorable scenes and songs. The characters are lively and fun, even the evil Queen. It should also be pointed out that, for all of the adorable animals and dwarfs, there are some genuinely spooky parts, too. Snow White fleeing through the shadowy forest is possibly my favorite scene of the whole movie. The Queen's ultimate fate is also quite dark. It's really a terrific film. A timeless classic that is essential viewing for everybody. I grew up a half-century after this came out and its age didn't show to me at all. I hope kids today that have been weaned on computer-animated films can still enjoy older cartoons like this.",10,6,7,3 June 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," Highly Overrated But Still Good
","A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so much more than it is. Greatest movie ever made? Get real. It's not even the greatest prison movie ever made. Hell, it's not even the best movie released in 1994! It's predictable and borrows heavily from decades of prison movie clichés. It's also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest admirers would have you believe. Still, it's an entertaining movie. Nice direction from Frank Darabont. Morgan Freeman is the highlight with a solid supporting cast. Tim Robbins, however, is borderline ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly 'stares-off-into-the-distance' moments. He's so far beneath Freeman as an actor it's sad. With a normal movie like this, I would focus more on the positives. I did give it a 7, after all. Unfortunately, it is easily the most overrated movie of all time (on IMDb, for sure) and as such the balance of positive to negative is out of whack.",7,39,96,28 May 2014
The Cannonball Run," 'You know what I like best about trees?'
","'All-star' comedy about assorted characters competing in a cross-country race. The main stars are Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise. But the cast is full of Burt's friends, as well as the likes of Roger Moore, Jackie Chan, Peter Fonda, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr. Of those, only Roger Moore is fun. The best part of the film is Adrienne 'Boom Boom' Barbeau's cleavage. I also love the Valerie Perrine cameo. Farrah Fawcett is Burt's love interest and her nipples are erect throughout the whole movie. She wears no bra, of course, which she was known for back then. Every time they have a tender scene, Farrah's headlights are on bright and you can't help but giggle or drool or a combination of the two. Her tree fascination is pretty cute stuff, though.It's painfully unfunny at times, especially when DeLuise is doing his thing. His thing, by the way, is being the unfunniest person on the planet. I know Burt thought he was hilarious. I also know Burt had a drug problem back then that no doubt colored his judgment. It does get better as it goes along but never rises above passable. Also worth mentioning is that several of the participants in this race drink (a lot) and drive. Doubtful that would happen today in a frivolous movie like this. I guess this is one case of times changing for the better.",7,3,5,26 February 2014
Halloween," A Horror Classic
","The best of an often unsavory genre, Halloween stands as the godfather of all slasher flicks. Imitated dozens of times over the last 35 years, it still hasn't been surpassed in terms of sheer creativity or originality. It set up tropes that have become constants in the horror genre, particularly in slasher films or their related ilk. It's also one of the very few slashers that can be called scary with a straight face.It made John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis' careers. As a Carpenter fan who enjoys most of his films, I find it hard to argue against the idea that this is his best. Curtis has never escaped being Laurie Strode, despite a career spanning decades with many other hit roles. It's just such a seminal film whose importance can't be overstated I think. Not to mention it's highly enjoyable from start to finish. The classic score, the amazing direction, the great cast -- it's all just perfect. Oh and speaking of great cast -- how can I forget Donald Pleasence, who steals every scene he's in. Through his performance he makes Dr. Loomis into a modern day Van Helsing for the slasher generation(s).If you've been living under a rock and haven't seen this film, please do immediately.",9,1,4,2 November 2013
Carrie," 'Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'
","Brian De Palma's adaptation of Stephen King's first novel is one of the director's best films, if not THE best. The story, which everyone reading this probably already knows, is about a teenage girl named Carrie White who is tormented at school by bullies and at home by her religious nut mother. Carrie has telekinetic powers which are unleashed after a horrible prom night prank. Both Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie deservedly received Oscar nominations. Neither won but that was the year of Network so that's not surprising. They both give memorable performances that are highlights of their respective careers. Nancy Allen and John Travolta are both excellent villains. Pino Donaggio's score deserves praise. Enough good things can't be said about De Palma's stylish direction. De Palma digs into his bag of tricks -- long tracking shots, split-screen, slow motion, etc. Most of the techniques that are associated with the director from his more popular films. I'm not a big fan of the man but as a director he entertains me, more often than not. Definitely a great film. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out. But please watch it before you watch any of the remakes, sequels, or variations that have been made over the years. There's nothing worse than when a great film is diminished to a newer audience because they saw the pale imitators that came after before they saw the original.",8,3,4,8 February 2014
The Wolverine," What Might Have Been
","This is basically a tale of two movies. I know Hugh Jackman wanted this movie to be an adaptation of the classic Chris Claremont/Frank Miller comic book mini-series. You can see bits of that story here. But then you have this other stuff, far removed from that story, that seems to be studio-imposed and ultimately hurts what could have been one of the best comic book movies to date. The good stuff, the stuff worth watching this for, are the slower, quieter parts of the story. The Wolverine and Mariko parts, basically. But all of the special effects-heavy parts and the loud, flashy action sequences suck and take away from the impact the movie would have otherwise had. There's probably no better example than the different climactic battle scenes. Wolverine vs Shingen is a much more powerful, emotional scene than the shallow, garish stuff with Viper and a guy in robot armor.I don't really blame James Mangold. No doubt it was Fox's interference that caused the problems and also caused Darren Aronofsky to bail before filming. You can see a better movie underneath this one. But Fox didn't have the guts to make that movie. Probably felt it wasn't commercial enough. Needed more robots and CGI fights on top of a speeding train. Still, it's good enough to watch and enjoy most of it. It's certainly miles better than the last Wolverine movie. But I can't help but feel sad thinking about what might have been. They very well could have given Wolverine his own 'Batman Begins' but instead we get just another watchable popcorn movie with hints at something more substantial.",6,41,55,26 June 2014
Iron Man," 'Give me a scotch. I'm starving.'
","Outstanding movie and possibly the best Marvel's done to date, at least as far as their shared universe films go. Let's cut right to the chase: Robert Downey, Jr. makes this movie work. I'm not going to say he's the perfect Tony Stark because Downey's Stark is really very different from how he has always been in the comics. But it works far better this way and is a huge point in favor of deviating from the source material, which is the eternal struggle between Hollywood and anything it adapts. This is one case where the changes they made worked out great. The rest of the cast is terrific, all following Downey's lead very well. His enthusiastic performance is a joy to watch. I'm sure it must have been a ball for Paltrow, Bridges, and the rest to act with him as they all seem to be having a great time in their scenes together. Jon Favreau does a praiseworthy job of directing, especially when he hadn't really done this type of movie before. The action and special effects are great. The script is smart and funny, though a lot of the humor comes from the ad-libbing of Downey and co-stars, so I'm not sure how much credit I can give the script for that. It's really a wonderful piece of entertainment without being mindless or crude. One of the best superhero films ever made.",8,3,4,30 May 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Red Dawn
","Murderiffic sequel to Man of Steel and the second in Zack Snyder's murderverse series about angst-driven superheroes, light on the hero part. Batman's the main killer this time around, probably because Snyder got his hand slapped so much for turning Superman into a killer in the first movie. Don't worry, Superkiller fans, Snyder manages to sneak in some Superman slaughter in one of the movie's irritating dream sequences. Yeah, that's right. In the first hour, anytime it appears something interesting is happening, it turns out to be a dream. Great storytelling. The first half of this movie is dull beyond belief and doubles down on the bleak, dour, and depressing tone of Man of Steel. We can add 'angry' to the mix this time, as a lot of characters are just so angry they're frothing at the mouth. Chief among these whiners is Batman, who is mad as hell and not going to take it anymore and never stops reminding us of this fact in every single scene. The script is disjointed and dumb, giving the appearance of dealing with weighty ideas while never coming close to actually doing it. For example, the main theme running throughout the first hour and change of the movie is just dropped once the fighting starts and the movie never returns to it. I hate that. If you're going to act like you're more grown-up than the average superhero movie, then follow through with it. Don't just cop out and leave it dangling while you devote the final hour to your hyperviolent action scenes and CGI monster.The second half of the film is the mindless action and destruction that we got so much of in Man of Steel. Hack Snyder has quickly become the superhero film's own Michael Bay. The best parts of the movie, to me, were the Clark Kent parts. No, not Superman. The Clark parts, with Lois and Perry and his parents (yes, parents plural as Pa Kent shows up in a hallucination or something). These are the only times the movie has any real heart or human connection. The rest of the time it's someone whining, killing, or whining about killing. Unfortunately, the Clark parts are very brief and make up a fraction of the movie in total. For their parts, Henry Cavill and Amy Adams again do well and come out of the movie smelling better than most of their co-stars. Although I really don't get what the point was of that business where Adams' Lois throws a spear into a pool of water only to have to retrieve it two minutes later. Honestly, though, there's quite a bit about this mess that needs explaining and that's pretty low on the list.Much of the focus in this one is spent on propping up Batman and introducing him as part of the murderverse. On that note, I've seen a lot of praise directed towards Ben Affleck for his performance and I must admit I don't get that at all. He's not bad but he's not particularly good either. The script doesn't give him a chance to show what he can do besides growl and destroy things every chance he gets. He never rises above the material so I can't get behind any praise parties thrown in his honor. Jesse Eisenberg is the film's villain and he is just the worst. Absolutely terrible! I refuse to call his character Lex Luthor since he is only that in name, certainly not in any characteristic that I recognize of Lex's. Basically Eisenberg is trying to do Heath Ledger's Joker here and failing miserably. He's annoying in every single scene and by the end you find yourself wondering why he is spared of the murderousness that the DC heroes have shown themselves to possess in these two movies. If you're going to kill bad guys, why leave the worst one alive?Wonder Woman is also here. That's basically all I can say about that. She doesn't speak much and it's taken for granted the audience is full of fanboys who know all about why she's there so no explanations are given. She's peppered throughout the movie as a Catwoman stand-in (sexy thief that flirts with Batman), to then show up in all her costumed glory (darkened colors, of course) to help in the big fight against the CGI Doomsday at the end. She's got a sword, because that's a thing now and it will undoubtedly help her with murdering in her own film, since she doesn't get to murder anyone here. We also get teases of Aquaman, Flash, and Cyborg. No explanations, just teases. Again, if you aren't a fan following all the information for these movies that comes out, you will be lost about half of this stuff. Which is just terrible storytelling but I am to the point of giving up on trying to understand the rationale behind those making the decisions on DC's films. There's a lot of reasons that Marvel is succeeding while DC flounders and, if you don't get those reasons by now, you probably never will. All I can say is that if you really loved Man of Steel's tone and thought that was the perfect direction to take a series of superhero movies, then you'll probably love this one. I did not love Man of Steel, although I tried so very hard to find positives about it since I have been a lifelong Superman fan. But my patience and good will has been exhausted and, from now on, I will be meeting every DC film with a very critical eye. This film is overlong, pretentious, unnecessarily grim, and just plain not fun to watch. There's not a single moment from this that put a smile on my face. Not one. How can you make a movie teaming up the two most recognizable superheroes ever and have it be so damn depressing?",4,8,16,14 May 2016
Tombstone," 'Skin that smokewagon and see what happens.'
","There have been many movies made about Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and the O.K. Corral. Chief among those are probably John Ford's 'My Darling Clementine' and John Sturges' 'Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.' Both of those are classic westerns that I love a lot. But this one is my favorite because it's just such an interesting and fun movie. Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott, and Bill Paxton as the Earps are all great. Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Stephen Lang, and the other Cowboys make for exciting, colorful villains. But the star of the show that steals every scene he's in is Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. This is easily the best role of his career, in my opinion. The rest of the cast is fantastic. Really it's an amazing movie with good characters and lots of memorable lines and scenes. While there are historical inaccuracies (aren't there always), it's more accurate than the other more well-regarded films about Earp and Holliday, such as the two I mentioned before. If you like westerns you should like this but I think it also has appeal outside of that fanbase, due to the fun script and the action movie tone of it all.",8,0,0,29 June 2014
Space Jam," Stupid But Entertaining
","Michael Jordan and assorted Looney Tunes cartoon characters play against aliens in a game of basketball. Adapted from an unpublished Shakespeare play, I believe. Surprisingly, Jordan's acting is pretty good. It's all the more impressive considering he's acting opposite nothing but green screen most of the time. Bill Murray is great in his small part but that's no surprise. As for the Looney Tunes characters: as with most modern versions of them, they are pretty lame. They lack the edge and humor of the classics. Not to mention the voices are weak. The addition of a new politically correct character, Lola Bunny, is insulting on several levels. Cynicism and nitpicks aside, it's an innocuous and enjoyable little bit of fluff. A couple of nice songs, too.",5,2,4,17 May 2014
X2: X-Men United," 'You picked the wrong house, bub.'
","Fantastic sequel that is regarded by many as superior to the original. I don't particularly agree but rather than wade into that argument I'll just say that I love both movies. Where this movie is obviously stronger than the first is in its action scenes. It has some especially strong sequences, such as the opening Nightcrawler scene at the White House or the assault on the X-mansion. These scenes and others like them are much more cinematic and well-staged than the action scenes from the first movie.Most of the first movie's stars shine here as well. Jackman and McKellen lead the pack again. Janssen, Romijn, Berry, and even Marsden improve upon their roles from the first film. Also returning from the first film with a significantly larger part is Shawn Ashmore's Iceman. He's really good. New to the cast are Alan Cumming's wonderful turn as Nightcrawler, Aaron Stanford's enjoyable Pyro, Kelly Hu's sexy and deadly Lady Deathstrike, and Brian Cox lending some weight as the villainous human Stryker. There are also a slew of fan-pleasing cameo appearances from comic book characters such as Kitty Pryde, Siryn, and Colossus.Where the movie does suffer some is that, in adding the new characters and giving them a lot of focus, it takes away from some characters from the first movie that I liked a great deal. Patrick Stewart's Professor X is sidelined for a large part of this one. Anna Paquin's Rogue is stuck in a romantic subplot that gives her little to do for most of the film. Worse, her plot never goes anywhere. It's in the same place at the end of the movie as it was at the beginning. Sadly, things would get even worse for her character moving forward in the series. A crying shame considering how important she was to the first movie.Bryan Singer's direction is even more polished than the first movie. The script, while a little more involved than your average comic book film (at that time especially), is intelligent and full of memorable lines and scenes. The special effects are very good. The music is better than the first movie as well, although still lacking a definitive score like Batman or Superman had. Judged on its own merits or by comparison, it's a great movie. It's a shame that Singer didn't return for the third film. We all know how that turned out without him. At least when he did return with Days of Future Past, he brought back the old magic.",8,1,2,31 May 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Mixed thoughts from someone who loved the first film
","A few complaints before I address what worked for me. While I enjoyed it, I felt it didn't have quite the 'wow' factor the first film had. The mood throughout is somber, both in look and feel, with the occasional bit of humor (mostly from Kat Dennings). The story is more complex and I'm not of the camp that feels that is always a good thing. Once again, the cast is great although it seems the supporting characters like Sif and The Warriors Three are largely wasted. Odin is especially pompous and unbearable this time around. When you have Thor having to counsel his father on peace not war, it feels at times like this isn't even the same Odin from the first film. Obviously the sci-fi gobbledygook elements will please many. I'm referring to the Aether nonsense and everything surrounding it. It's one of those 'shut your brain off to enjoy it' moments for me. Also, Loki's trick of using illusions or impersonating people was used way too much. It made the last time he uses it in the film less effective. The villain Malekith is uncharismatic and, frankly, dull. Finally, the look of the film wasn't my favorite. This is just a stylistic preference but I felt it was too 'Lord of the Rings'. Everything was muted colors and kind of depressing. The first film was much brighter and felt like more of a superhero movie. Stick with what has worked for you, Marvel. Let DC make their dour superhero films. Keep it bright.OK, now you read all that and you probably wonder how I can say I still enjoyed the film. Well, I loved the performances from Hemsworth and Hiddleston. I also liked Kat Dennings and appreciated how she lightened things up. Natalie Portman had way more to do than the first film and was enjoyable and pretty as usual. While I said I didn't care for the overall dark look of the film, I did admire the special effects. They were very well done, save for the opening scene which was a little too fake with obvious CGI soldiers. Ultimately, I enjoyed it enough but it wasn't one of my favorite Marvel films. Thor is my favorite Marvel superhero and I loved the first movie. I realize a lot of fans are rabid about these films and have a 'you either love it or hate it' mentality but I'm in the middle. I liked it but I didn't love it.",6,0,0,13 February 2014
Lucy," Goofy Fun
","A lot of people seem to have a big problem with this film using the myth that humans only use 10% of their brain. Really it's only true of people in Hollywood. Because this is just an entertainment piece, it doesn't bother me much. If it was something more pretentious, like an Aronofsky film, I would have a bigger problem with it. The movie is certainly watchable from beginning to end. I'd even say it's fun most of the way. But it never makes the most of its premise and even seems to give up trying relatively quickly. You have a character who can do pretty much anything but the things they have her do are mundane and the only threat to her they can come up with are angry drug dealers with guns. The ending is the default transcendental trip that every movie about humans evolving since 2001: A Space Odyssey has used a variation of. The most amusing part is where Lucy (Scarlett) meets Lucy (ape woman). But 'space baby' it is not. The use of the animal footage is the kind of stuff film school students do. Maybe it does have its pretentious moments. Scarlett Johansson's entertaining. The guy from Oldboy is fun but the character was really an unimpressive threat. Morgan Freeman's got new choppers. Good for him. Overall, it's an enjoyable but goofy film that shouldn't be taken too seriously.",6,3,9,21 December 2014
Cinderella," 'Poor Cinderelly!'
","Classic Disney adaptation of the Cinderella story. It's a charming, lovely fairy tale with romance and quite a bit of humor (perhaps too much for some tastes). It's not very fashionable today but it's one of those films that has stood the test of time and will continue to do so, long after one generation of whiners and malcontents has been replaced by another. The voice work is wonderful and the music enchanting. The memorable songs include 'A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,' 'Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,' and 'So This Is Love.' The animation is the strongest selling point. It's Golden Age Disney, so you know the characters and backgrounds are well-drawn with rich, gorgeous colors that really pop. The only negatives are the story's familiarity and a little too much comic relief provided by Cinderella's animal friends. It's a beautiful story, told in that inimitable classic Disney style. Recommended for everyone who isn't a cynic at heart.",8,3,3,12 January 2016
A Nightmare on Elm Street," 'I don't see why you can't just give me a pill to keep me from dreaming.'
","Wes Craven's classic about a killer named Freddy Krueger who attacks teenagers in their dreams because of something their parents did years before. One of the best and most creative horror films of all time. It's often lumped in with movies in the slasher subgenre, and it does use many of those tropes, but it's much more interesting and imaginative than 99% of the slashers out there. Freddy Krueger, wonderfully played by Robert Englund, became a pop culture phenomenon like nothing that had been seen with horror movies since maybe the Universal movie monsters of old. The guy was on lunchboxes, for crying out loud.The cast is pretty good, with Englund a standout for obvious reasons. Heather Langenkamp is one of horror's best 'final girls.' She has a relatability and normal quality about her that is rare for Hollywood. Compare her to any of today's young horror movie actresses, who are almost always glamorous bimbos who are aspiring pop music stars or at least look like they are. Admittedly she's not the strongest actress but she does well with the role of Nancy. John Saxon is good as Nancy's father. Johnny Depp makes his film debut as Nancy's boyfriend and does a fine job. The only stinker in the cast really is Jsu Garcia (billed here as Nick Corri). Every scene with him is a little cringeworthy as he seems to be trying to be the James Dean of horror. The movie's full of memorable scenes and striking images, such as Freddy's face coming through the wall above Nancy's bed or his glove reaching up between her legs in the bathtub. Wes Craven's direction is excellent in what is arguably the highlight of his long career. The script is smart and inventive. Charles Bernstein's iconic score deserves more praise than it gets. It's an atmospheric and influential horror film that gets better with each viewing. The sequels, TV show, and remake that followed only served to highlight how great this first Nightmare on Elm Street film is. If you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself a favor and watch it. For the love of all that's sacred, please watch it before you even think about watching the 2010 remake.",9,1,2,17 October 2015
Godzilla," 'I bet he's here to restore balance. He can defeat them.'
","I have mixed feelings on this movie. I liked it but felt it could have been so much better. The first hour drags on but I guess that's because it's taboo to do a movie under two hours these days if you want to be taken seriously as a filmmaker. The biggest gripe I have is one I'm sure is shared by many other viewers. Namely that Godzilla doesn't become a big part of the movie until late and so we basically have over an hour of a two-hour Godzilla movie devoted to humans and a new monster (with a terribly boring design). Once he does show up, the action and special effects are good but never so impressive as to make you forget the long wait. Of the humans, Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe are both good, as you might expect. Cranston is not the star, as the trailers would lead you to believe. The star is Aaron Taylor-Johnson and he does a fine job though nothing particularly noteworthy. Elizabeth Olsen, whom I adore, is largely wasted in a supported part where her only purpose is to survive the movie to be reunited with her husband. So is it worth seeing? Yes but temper your expectations. It's not as good as the original Godzilla (either version) or as much fun as the sequels. In many ways it has more in common with director Gareth Edwards' previous film, Monsters, than it does with Godzilla. If you liked Monsters (and I did) you'll probably like this. Maybe not as much, though.",6,3,5,18 September 2014
Deadpool," 'And that's why Regina rhymes with fun.'
","I had zero expectations for this because growing up I never cared for the comic book character Deadpool and the previous version of that character in the dreadful X-Men Origins: Wolverine, also played by Ryan Reynolds, was nothing to get excited about. But this was actually a very entertaining movie with lots of action and humor. I think it's one of the rare comic book movies that has just as much, if not more, appeal to the mainstream than to the fanboy set. Ryan Reynolds is funny and charming and I immediately wanted to forgive him for his past cinematic sins. The movie plays to his strengths as the likable frat boy (Van Wilder) much better than his last attempt at launching a superhero franchise (Green Lantern). The rest of the cast is decent, although this is Reynolds' show all the way. He controls every scene and thankfully has a good chemistry with all of his co-stars. The action scenes are very nicely done, as well, although the movie's climax is a little flat. The only real negative is that the CGI Colossus is pretty terrible-looking. Thankfully his role in the movie and how he plays off Reynolds and others provides lots of laughs. Still, he looks like a big cartoon and that is a little distracting. Anyway, this is a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously and gives the audience some great popcorn entertainment. Definitely worth a look even if you don't typically like these kind of movies.",7,4,12,15 May 2016
Cloud Atlas," One of the Most Pretentious Movies I've Ever Seen
","The Wachowski...um...siblings attempt to make the epic movie to end all epic movies. That's part of the problem. They're trying too hard to make this something epic and it winds up feeling like a pretentious bore of a film.The film is divided into many different stories that each tie back together in ways that are supposed to be profound but fail to feel that way. The South Pacific 1846 and San Francisco 1973 parts are wholly uninteresting, uninvolving endeavors. Cures for insomnia for sure. UK 2012 has a few amusing moments courtesy of Jim Broadbent, easily the best actor in the film. So far ahead of the others it's shameful. Tom Hanks, as in the South Pacific sequence, is hidden away behind a putty nose makeup job. The makeup in this film is terrible and distracting. Don't even get me started on the white/yellow/whatever face.Neo Seoul 2144 is mindnumbingly dull and serves to be the movie's preachiest part. The 1936 part is also message-heavy. Despite this, it's the film's second best story. Big Island 2321 is probably the film's most interesting story, although it takes awhile to figure out what the heck everyone is saying. It's like watching a foreign language movie without subtitles sometimes. This is also the area of the movie where Hanks overacts the least. The acting in this film is uneven at best, with the best acting coming from the Brits and the worst coming from the Americans, particularly Hanks.Ultimately it's a preachy 'message movie,' with all of its messages being delivered with the subtlety of a jackhammer. You can see them all coming a mile away. For a nearly three hour film, this is a death sentence. If you can't surprise your audience, you really shouldn't take up that much of their time. This is a chore of a movie to sit through, anchored by a simplistic worldview and a desire to be something much deeper and significant than it really is.",4,2,8,7 December 2013
Fantastic Four," Disappointing
","What a missed opportunity. When it was first released, I thought 'Meh, it's okay I guess.' I gave it a six. But over the years I had zero desire to rewatch this movie or its sequel. For the purposes of this review I finally did rewatch it and was surprised at how bored I was by it. I always knew it wasn't a smart movie, but I had remembered it being more fun than it is. As time goes by, its flaws stand out more.The cast is mixed. Ioan Gruffudd and Chris Evans are probably the most suited to their parts. Evans is especially good. Jessica Alba looks pretty but her Sue Storm seems like an airhead at times. Michael Chiklis is a little old for the part of Ben Grimm. Ideally Ben and Reed should be the same age yet Chiklis is ten years older and looks it. I would say Julian McMahon was miscast but I can't since I don't know what character he's playing. It sure as hell isn't Dr. Doom.The movie seems to end just as it's getting started. There are no defining moments or memorable scenes. Most of what made the comic book work is absent; notably the actual 'fantastic' part. The score is forgettable. The script is weak. Tim Story's direction is workmanlike. There are some fun moments, mostly from Chris Evans. I appreciated the lighter tone to the film. A Fantastic Four movie shouldn't be dark. Still, the negatives outweigh the positives. I suppose it's worth watching if you are a fan of comic book movies or of the Fantastic Four in particular. But keep your expectations low.",5,1,5,7 May 2014
Jackie Brown," One of my favorite Tarantino movies
","Jackie Brown is considered by many (myself included) to be one of Quentin Tarantino's best films and also one of his most under-appreciated. There's love for it but it isn't met with the same reverence as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, or the same enthusiasm as his genre homages that followed. But it should be more widely praised as it's an exceptional movie. The direction is wonderful, the soundtrack is fun, and the script is full of memorable dialogue, as you would expect from Tarantino. The cast is terrific, led by '70s legend Pam Grier in her 'comeback' role and Robert Forster in an understated performance that deservedly earned him an Oscar nomination. Every scene with Grier and Forster, separately or together, is a treat. As fun as Sam Jackson is, these two are what hold the film together and make it so enjoyable to watch over and over. For his part, Jackson does what you expect him to do. He's foul-mouthed and funny but still very menacing when he needs to be. Robert DeNiro and Bridget Fonda both offer amusing support. Chris Tucker has a brief but funny appearance. The movie has a lot of humor. That's one of the main things that makes it so enjoyable to watch over and over. It's a great film that probably holds more appeal to non-Tarantino fans than most of his movies do.",8,9,11,29 October 2015
Saboteur," 'You look like a saboteur. You have a saboteur's disposition.'
","When sabotage strikes a wartime aircraft factory, employee Barry Kane (Bob Cummings) falls under suspicion. Kane knows a man named Fry (Norman Lloyd) is the real saboteur but police say Fry doesn't exist. So Kane takes it on the run to search for the mystery man and clear his name. Along the way he is joined, reluctantly at first, by a pretty young woman named Pat Martin (Priscilla Lane). The two wind up tangling with a group of fascists who plot to commit more sabotage on American targets.One of my favorite 'lesser' Hitchcock films. I say lesser because it's never been one of his more celebrated works. Yeah, it's not Hitch's most unique or complex film. It's also similar in some ways to an earlier classic, The 39 Steps. I get that. But it is a very entertaining and exciting wartime espionage picture with a quick pace and some great set pieces. The bridge jump, the movie theater, and the Statue of Liberty climax are all highlights. Love the scenes with the circus caravan and the blind man. Pretty hokey but I liked it. It's also a beautiful film to look at with some of the best black & white photography of any Hitchcock movie. Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane are both likable heroes. Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd make for appropriately slimy villains. Not one of Hitch's best but very good and underrated.",7,1,2,10 December 2014
Her," Loses Steam Halfway Through
","I haven't had the best of luck with most of the critically-acclaimed movies of 2013. Some I thought were good but overrated and others I absolutely hated. So far, I have yet to see one that blew me away. Sadly, 'Her' is no exception. I did like the film and admire its artistry to an extent. But ultimately it didn't move me the way it apparently has many other people. So I was left with a deflated feeling of 'ok, that was that.' It's not a film I will watch again anytime soon, if ever. I liked the acting. I had no problems with anyone's work. I also liked the future tech. It was very well done and some of the more plausible glimpses of near-future technology I've seen in a movie.I enjoyed the first hour of the story a lot. As it went past that I began to feel fatigued by the entire concept and I could see how it was going to end. Basically you have a movie that is two hours and about 95% of that is a conversation between Joaquin Phoenix and a disembodied voice (Scarlett Johansson). That, to me, is a limited concept that you can only toy around with for so long before it starts to wear on one's patience. I knew where it was going. I knew Samantha would move on/break up with Theodore. I knew the other OSes would do the same with their users. I knew that he and Amy would end up together in some manner. This was all telegraphed midway through the movie yet it goes on for another hour. I enjoyed the film but I felt like it really could have been better. Cut the length by maybe 30 minutes and speed up the events of the second half and it would have been greatly improved.",6,1,4,23 February 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," 'If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die historic on the fury road!'
","Continuing from the original Mad Max film series (although I'm not sure where this fits in continuity-wise), this movie finds Max (Tom Hardy) taken prisoner by the War Boys, a cult-like army for warlord Immortan Joe. When one of Joe's rig drivers, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), tries to help Joe's young 'wives' escape, the warlord gathers all his forces to pursue her. Max, being used as a walking blood bag for one of the War Boys, finds himself along for the ride.Being a fan of the original Mad Max movies, I was more than a little hesitant about a new one with a new actor in the role. I was also hesitant with regards to George Miller's capabilities nowadays. He has done mostly family fare since the '80s and, let's be honest, most of the great directors from the '70s and '80s have since lost whatever magic they once possessed. To add to this the critics were all praising this movie and the hype was through the roof and I'm always skeptical of movies heavily pushed by The Machine. Despite my reservations, I can honestly say I enjoyed the movie a lot. Its action scenes are exciting and refreshing. I do wish that Miller could've pulled it off without so much CGI. There are many moments where the action scenes are diluted by the poor blending of CGI cartoonery in with the real. But I'm sure I sound like an old fuddy duddy, as I often do when it comes to CGI in action movies these days.I liked this but didn't enjoy it as much as the original series, all of which I've rewatched within the past year. My primary reason for this is that this doesn't feel especially unique in any way. It feels like the previous movies visually and even homages certain things directly from those movies, but it never feels like it adds anything of its own that's particularly creative. Each one of the previous movies built on the other and added new characters, lines, and moments that were distinct and memorable. I also don't feel like Tom Hardy brings anything impressive to the table. Part of that is the script's fault as Max is almost a supporting character instead of the star in the first half. Charlize Theron gets the best role in the movie and easily outshines Hardy, who mostly just grunts his lines and tries to give his best Blue Steel for close-ups. So I do have some problems with this. But, at the end of the day, it entertained the hell out of me and that's what matters most. Kudos to George Miller for proving he's still got it. Now if only John Carpenter could figure out where he left his mojo and give us one more great movie, I would be ecstatic.",6,1,11,27 July 2015
Pocahontas," 'I'd rather die tomorrow than live a hundred years without knowing you.'
","Disney take on the story of Pocahontas and John Smith. I just saw this for the first time since its initial release. My feelings back then were somewhat lukewarm but, to put that in context, my tastes were more narrow then and I was not really into Disney or anything that felt even slightly like a 'chick flick.' Now I'm happy to say I recognize what an enjoyable film this is. The animation is wonderful with so much beautiful imagery that it took me by surprise because I didn't remember that from my first viewing. The scene where John Smith first sees Pocahontas will take your breath away. The movie makes excellent use of lush colors. Some scenes are saturated with purples and blues -- it's really stunning. Pocahontas herself is gorgeously drawn. She's easily one of the most striking Disney Princesses ever. The score is evocative and lovely with one great song ('Colors of the Wind') and some other forgettable ones. The voice work is wonderful, especially Irene Bedard in the lead. There are nice touches of humor throughout with a talking tree and playful animals that seem to have stepped right out of Bambi's forest. The emotional stuff is where the movie really knocks it out of the park, whether it be the romance between Pocahontas and Smith or little brilliant scenes such as when Powhatan feels his wife's spirit in the wind.The cause for much criticism and complaints about the film come, of course, from the history police. The movie is historically inaccurate, which should come as no surprise to anyone over the age of four. I'm never one to get all that worked up about historical accuracy in movies (let alone cartoons) anyway. You want to be entertained, watch this movie. You want to learn more about history, open a book. One charming reviewer here said the movie was guilty of whitewashing genocide. What a shocker that Disney didn't want to make an animated version of Soldier Blue! Look, it's a cartoon loosely based on people who lived and died 400 years ago. Unclench your fists, take a breath, and stop relying on Hollywood to educate your children and getting ticked off when they don't do it the way you want them to. It's a good animated film and I think everyone who isn't looking to get angry about as many things as they can before they die should see it.",7,2,4,21 September 2015
Draft Day," Entertaining, even if you don't like football movies
","Surprisingly good football movie about Cleveland Browns general manager Kevin Costner on the day of the NFL draft. I say surprisingly because I wasn't expecting much. These sports dramas, particularly the football ones, often bore me. This one started off kind of like that and I was worried at first. But it picked up and I was soon wrapped up in the story. That's in large part due to the fine cast, especially Kevin Costner. You might ask why I watched this if I typically don't like sports dramas. Well the short answer is because Tom Welling from Smallville is in it. My friend was going to watch it for him so I thought 'might as well.' Turns out his role is pretty small. Anyway, it's a good movie. If you're not into football and you think that might keep you from enjoying this, don't worry. You don't really have to be a football fan to follow along with the plot. It's more about the behind-the-scenes business of football than the game itself.",6,13,17,21 September 2014
The Wizard of Oz," Flawless
","The most difficult thing about reviewing The Wizard of Oz is finding something to say about it that doesn't begin with 'the best.' It's hard to argue that this isn't a strong contender for the greatest movie of all time. Navel-gazing dramas about the human condition are fine, and I know most critics' lists would give preference to those sorts of films, but this movie has a little bit of everything and is easily among the most perfect films ever made. It doesn't matter if you're a kid or a grown-up. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic that has appeal for every open-hearted person out there. It's full of iconic lines, songs, characters, and moments. It's had a cultural impact few films do. So many things from the film have made their way into our everyday lives and language. If I had to single out one thing about it I love more than the memorable characters played by an ideal cast, exuberant Arlen & Harburg songs, delightful story, and beautiful sets, costumes, and matte painting backdrops, it would be the vibrant and rich Technicolor. It's such a gorgeous looking movie. Funny, sentimental, sincere -- it's a masterpiece that I've been in love with since I was a little kid. I've never grown tired of it and I hope I never do.",10,7,10,29 November 2014
The Martian," Smart, exciting crowd-pleaser
","Exceptional sci-fi drama from Ridley Scott about an astronaut (Matt Damon) stranded on Mars and the efforts made to rescue him. As others have pointed out, there's more than a little bit here that reminds you of movies like Apollo 13 and Cast Away (particularly the former). I fail to see how that's a knock on it but it's being presented as such by some. We all come to movies with our own expectations and baggage. I'm not a Scott fanboy expecting him to wow me (his last two films were not great). I just wanted to be entertained and this did the trick. It's a movie aimed at the masses that is smarter than your average movie aimed at the masses. Maybe it's not for all nerds (a quick glance at some of the reviews shows a lot of inane nit-picking from people who seem to have no concept of dramatic license), but I didn't find the movie dumbed-down at all. I also want to say how much I appreciated that this managed to stay remarkably light and positive while still maintaining the tension, proving once again that you don't have to be depressing to be good drama. If you haven't seen The Martian yet, you should. It's a great film with a first-rate cast, good direction, and stellar effects. If you're just looking for a quality movie to entertain you for a while, this should be something you'll enjoy.",8,94,159,4 January 2016
The Godfather," 'Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.'
","The Godfather, for the few of you who don't already know, is about the Corleone mafia family struggling to survive a war with a rival family. That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.",10,6,9,15 July 2014
