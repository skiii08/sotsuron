Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A true disappointment.
","Could this movie have been more horrible?  Has George Lucas forgotten what it takes to make a good MOVIE?  Forget all the effects, that's mere window dressing.  Develop some characters, get rid of Jar-Jar, and focus on some grown-up dialog.  The acting is so horrible in this movie, from little Darth, all the way up to Ewan McGregor, who is a fine actor.  That should tell you something about the directing.  It's so disappointing that so much time and effort was spent on the digital graphics at the expense of everything else.  If this was any other movie, people would not be so afraid to criticize it.  Believe me, I wanted this movie to be good as much if not more than anyone else.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  Lucas is so concerned about non-violence and making this movie for the kids, that he totally alienated the generation that made this series the classic that it's become. The war between the Gungans and the droid army was an absolute sham. Without giving away too much, the climax was a one of the more unoriginal, unimaginative endings I've ever seen.  I could go on forever with the disappointments of this film, it's really that horrible.",Null,0,1,20 August 1999
