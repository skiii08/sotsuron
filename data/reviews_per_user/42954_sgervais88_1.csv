The Ring," Just this one part...
","Okay, there is this one part in the movie where Rachel is in the kitchen talking on the phone with Ruth, her sister, and she starts choking on that...long, hairy thing. OMG I was gagging along with her, it was so disgusting.And the face of her niece and of Noah...after Samara had killed them...OMFG don't get me started on how awesome those were. I was like, go back! go back! rewind it! but my friends were too much of a wuss to let me see it again.Basically, this movie is scary on it's own without all the blood and gore that is in other scary movies. That's what makes it totally original.I would totally recommend (sp) this film as one for people who want to watch a scary movie without all that nasty blood everywhere.Loved It!",8,1,2,11 June 2005
