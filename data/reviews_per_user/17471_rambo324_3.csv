The Avengers," A- mazing...
","Every once in a while there comes a movies that blows out your mind and make you ask for more....the Avengers is one of them. Have already seen it twice ( It was released in India a week prior to US) and will have no qualms seeing it again on the big screen...This movie is a treat for all Marvel -Followers as it is a continuation of the series of events that take place towards the rolling credits of Captain America-The first Avenger, Thor and even The Incredible Hulk to some extent.Every character has his own personality /psyche...and how they end up as a formidable force is what the Avengers is..It has some hilarious moments which would make you laugh your heart out.....So guys.....go grab that bucket of popcorn and enjoy the 2.5 hours of joy ride...called the Avengers!!!",10,2,6,1 May 2012
Joker," A Masterpiece That Deserves Multiple Viewing
","I was fortunate enough to watch this movie on 2 October on an IMAX. And boy.... the movie surely lived up to its hype and humongous expectations. If Heath Ledger was menacing and mesmerizing as Joker in The Dark Knight, Joaquin Pheonix is that unstoppable force that gives us the Joker that we all truly deserved. You will feel his pain , his sorrows , his dreams , his anger... you will become .. the Joker. The movie got a standing ovation at the end. In fact, I got so much into the character, that I could correctly guess what the Joker's reaction would be , in couple of crucial scenes. This is what Tod Phillips and Joaquin Pheonix have achieved. Finally, this movie does not glorify violence and anarchy, it just shows what happens when you push certain people beyond certain boundaries.",10,2,2,3 October 2019
Creed II," Packs a solid punch !!!
","Creed 2 is better than Creed 1, and does a great job in setting up stage for Adonis Creed for Creed 3. This was Stallone's last movie as Rocky Balbao and is a fitting tribute to the character . Dolph Lundgren and Florian Montanue are perfect as Ivan Drago and Victor Drago .",10,4,6,14 December 2018
