Walk the Line," They couldn't have done it better
","WALK THE LINE (2005)directed by: James Mangoldstarring: Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Robert Patrickplot: The story of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), his rise to fame, and the love of his life, June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).my thoughts: I was just getting into Johnny Cash (I'm only 17) when I heard this film was coming out. I usually can't get into movies about a famous person's life, I don't know why. But this one pulled me in from the beginning.Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely amazing as Cash. He goes through so much emotion in this film and does really well in the music scenes, especially with Witherspoon.Reese Witherspoon was very cute as June Carter, also adequately showing her underrated talent. Her and Phoenix totally made be buy the love story, and not just because it really happened. Ginnifer Goodwin and Robert Patrick also lend their presence as Cash's wife and father.This film also includes other famous music stars of Cash's time such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley.Definitely check this out if you are a fan of Johnny Cash or June Carter, or just great movies.",8,4,7,6 March 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Nicely done remake
","THE HILLS HAVE EYES (2006)directed by: Alexandre Ajastarring: Aaron Stanford, Vinessa Shaw, Emilie de Ravin, and Dan Byrdplot: A suburban American family have their car and trailer break down in the middle of a nuclear bomb test village in the desert, which is occupied by mutated, murderous, possibly cannibal rapists, and you know the drill.my thoughts: I was just as excited to see the remake at the Palace Theatre as I was to see the original. I knew that it's directed by Alexandre Aja and produced by Wes Craven, where can you go wrong with that?After the opening murder, this film didn't impress me too much. It did have a very good atmosphere, as in the original. But I didn't like how almost everything was exactly the way it was in the original since I was watching them back-to-back.But then, once the violence began, I realized this is a fun, gory remake. The deaths are almost the same but shown with more blood and guts, we have Doug (this time played by Aaron Stanford) taking the lead while in the original he wasn't too developed.The suspense was also great here. You never know how many things can happen to an infant. And half this movie has Doug trying to keep his baby from biting the dust.Emilie de Ravin and Dan Byrd take the characters of Brenda and Bobby to a different level, having Ravin show more of a naughty side and Byrd show more of a bad ass side.The only thing that really bothered me from that point on was the ending, it just didn't do it for me. At least it left it open for a sequel, which could be pretty good.",8,7,16,6 March 2006
Psycho," Creepy classic slasher film
","PSYCHO (1960)directed by: Alfred Hitchcockstarring: Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, and John Gavinplot: Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) runs away from home after stealing $40,000 from her employer so she can marry her boyfriend Sam (John Gavin). One rainy night, she takes refuge in the Bates Motel, run by the kind, young Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who also takes care of his ill mother. This sets off a series of horrific events when Marion, Sam, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and a detective (Martin Balsam) try to discover the secrets of the Bates family.my thoughts: There is really nothing new to say about PSYCHO that hasn't been said already. It's just the perfect thriller. It has a great script, beautiful directing, well developed characters, and much more.The characters are greatly casted. Anthony Perkins definitely portrayed one of the horror genre's best characters in Norman Bates - a kind, handsome young man who has a lot of dark secrets to hide. Janet Leigh is a very classy actress and it works in the role of a woman who has done some pretty bad things but she is still sympathetic enough to care about. Vera Miles, Martin Balsam, and Simon Oakland also do great while John Gavin is a bit wooden. Not as bad as people say but still wooden.The setting is also great. A simple, deserted motel with a large, dark, and creepy mansion just over the hill from it. The Bates Motel is a lot like the character of Norman himself. Seems simple and looks nice, but has terrible secrets behind it. The motel and mansion are just like characters in the film.The music is very suspenseful. I don't think any horror score can match this other than CARRIE. The sound effects that come with the knife make the death scenes much more effective, as the same sound did 16 years later when Carrie used her powers.Alfred Hitchcock is a great director. The shower scene, the staircase scene, and the finale in the cellar alone are reasons to see this film. I envy anyone who hasn't seen it.Definitely check it out, it belongs in any movie fan's collection.",10,1,3,9 March 2006
Carrie," My favorite horror film of all time
","CARRIE (1976) directed by: Brian De Palma starring: Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Amy Irving, and John Travolta plot: Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a haunted teenage girl. At school she is constantly tormented by her peers and at home she is abused by her fanatically religious mother (Piper Laurie). One day in the girls showers, Carrie has her first period. Having no knowledge of this important event, she freaks out, thinking she is dying, and the girls have no sympathy, they just laugh, chant and throw tampons. While pretty Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels guilty and has her boyfriend (William Katt) take Carrie to the prom, mean-spirited Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen) conspires with her boyfriend Billy (John Travolta) to make Carrie the target of a horrible prank on prom night. What everyone doesn't know is that Carrie was born with the ability to move objects with her mind, and she is pushed too far on her one special night.my thoughts: I love this horror film, and it is my favorite. The story, the directing, the cast, and the score all meld together to make the perfect horror film.The acting is perfect. Sissy Spacek made me really feel sorry for Carrie. She showed us that Carrie was smart, creative and sweet deep down inside and she was actually very pretty. Piper Laurie scared me as Margaret White, very crazy and over-the-top in a scary way. Her dialog at the end was perfect and she was a very interesting character. Amy Irving is great as the popular girl who actually shows some sympathy for Carrie, and even gives up her prom ticket and date for the girl. Irving plays the character very sympathetic yet very naive. William Katt was also very sympathetic as the brave Tommy Ross, the most popular guy in school taking the least popular girl in school to the prom. The guy also has great hair lol. Betty Buckley did good as the gym teacher who understands both Carrie and the mean girls. Nancy Allen, John Travolta and P.J. Soles were great mean kids. Nancy Allen was pretty and whiny, John Travolta was goofy, and P.J. Soles was annoying in a hot way.Brian De Palma is one of my favorite directors and his work was especially great here. I loved every shot he put in this movie, the only complaint is that his work in the opening locker room scene make him seem very peeping tom-ish, a theme he puts in a lot of his films. His camera-work mostly shined in the prom scene.Pino Donnagio provides one of the greatest horror scores ever. It changes mood with the film. It can be scary, suspenseful, beautiful or sad.So if you want a great dramatic horror film with perfect acting, directing, writing and music, then definitely check out CARRIE.",10,1,1,3 February 2006
Final Destination," An original and scary film
","FINAL DESTINATION (2000)starring: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, and Kristen Clokeplot: Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) is one of many students boarding Flight 180 to Paris for their senior trip. He can not seem to shake his fear of flying, and for good reason. Alex has a premonition of the plane exploding and ends up getting himself, five other students, and a teacher kicked off. To their horror, the plane explodes on take off. But Alex does not feel as if it is all over. Soon after, the survivors begin dying in freak accidents in the order they were meant to die on the plane.my thoughts: During a time when every horror film involved a masked killer targeting 25 year old teenagers while a virgin tries to discover his/her identity, FINAL DESTINATION was desperately needed by us horror fans.This is a scary and original teen slasher. It has a great scary premise that really makes you think, great performances from all, a creepy music score, some pretty gory death scenes, and a cameo from Tony 'Candyman' Todd. Devon Sawa is perfect as the teenager with a gift for seeing into the future. He goes through every emotion perfectly and portrays a very layered character. Ali Larter is also pretty good as the lonely girl who feels what Alex sees. She was interesting in a way where you didn't really get to know what was up with her until towards the end, and her relationship with Alex is interesting.Kerr Smith played a jerk off jock perfectly and made me really hate his character. Kristen Cloke is pretty good as the teacher-turned paranoid mess. Sean William Scott is great comic relief. And Tony Todd, Amanda Detmer, and Chad E. Donnella do good with their small roles.However, I highly disliked Daniel Roebuck and Roger Guenveur Smith as the detectives that get in the way. They were annoying, pointless characters that just get in the way of an otherwise great horror movie.This film also spawned two fun sequels and I do not see why it didn't skyrocket Devon Sawa's career.",8,0,2,9 August 2006
The Wizard of Oz," My favorite movie as a child, and it still holds up today!
","THE WIZARD OF OZ (1939)directed by: Victor Flemingstarring: Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Billie Burke, and Margaret Hamilton.plot: Dororthy Gale (Judy Garland) is a country girl living a boring life, hoping for something exciting to happen to her. One fateful day, she runs away from home and a twister sweeps her away to a magical land called Oz. There, she accidentally kills a witch and the witch's sister, the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) is after her for revenge. Glinda (Billie Burke), a good witch, gives Dorothy a pale of ruby slippers which can help her in an unknown way. When she finally becomes homesick, she goes on a quest to find the Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan), the one man who she believes can help her return home, while she makes some friends along the way.thoughts: Spending my first six years in Chittenango, New York (the birth place of L. Frank Baum, the author of the novel), I grew to love the movie THE WIZARD OF OZ, since it was advertised all over the town, and there is still yellow painting on the sidewalks (although it is sadly fading away). Now that I am 17, I viewed this film again, and I still love it.It has a great cast that really knows how to act, dance and sing. It has a great director behind the camera. It has great music. It has a great story. And I love the idea of mixing black and white (the Kansas scenes) and color (the Oz scenes).Even though this film is almost 70 years old, it still has no flaws (to me, anyway) and every parent should introduce this film to their children.",10,1,2,4 January 2006
