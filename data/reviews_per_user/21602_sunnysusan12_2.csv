50 First Dates," Enjoyable & fun but not Academy Award winning material. Good for a rainy Sunday afternoon.
","To twist the immortal words of Marlon Brando, 'This coulda been a contenda...'I enjoyed this film a lot for what it was. It's fun & works, mostly because of the chemistry between Sandler & Barrymore. It's too bad Sandler's propensity for juvenile potty humor kept it from being an Oscar-winning classic.Wonderful things about this movie? 1. The music totally, totally rocks. I sooo need this soundtrack. 2. The Hawaiian scenery & marine wildlife are gorgeous. 3. The vast majority of the principal actors are spot on with their performances, helping draw the audience into the story & setting. Drew Barrymore  amazing, wonderful, heartwarming performance. Sean Astin  hilarious. Rob Schneider  surprisingly believable. 4. The storyline/movie premise gets an A++. Not only was it original, but it dealt with Traumatic Brain Injury in a respectful way without magic Hollywood fixes.Things that will keep me from buying this movie? 1. Vomiting animals as humor 2. Unnecessary crude language/humor 3. Rob Schneider's channeling of Cheech & Chong. The part could have been so much more had he not turned it into a stereotype. 5. The fact that Adam Sandler  while believable as an intelligent man who really cared for Drew's character  was completely unbelievable as a veterinarian. I mean, c'mon...Sandler going through medical school??? There's just no way on God's green earth that would happen & he would retain the juvenile sense of humor he exhibits throughout the film. Not to say that Sandler's interpretation of the role isn't amusing/heartwarming, etc. but I'm sorry, I just don't buy him as a vet. Part of the zoo cleaning crew? Now that, I would have bought.All in all I'd say that this was sort of like watching a bunch of friends who enjoyed one another do their own silly spin-off of a movie they liked. I can only hope that a less adolescent re-make is made someday because, in the right hands, this script could be a masterpiece.",5,2,4,13 February 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Funny chick flick
","This was a very enjoyable watch. Meryl Streep has long been one of my favorite actresses and she did not disappoint in this role. Indeed, I can only imagine what a fun time she must have had revving herself up to be the biggest b*tch imaginable every day for work.While Anne Hathaway is fast becoming a favorite with me, it was strange to see her living with her boyfriend - the film didn't sell their being a couple or spend much time on their relationship from the get-go and I didn't really buy into it much. I don't know that the movie needed to explore that relationship more but frankly, for the amount of time spent on developing that side of things, they could have been shown as two people dating in separate cities.Of course, part of the movie takes place in Paris, so that was lovely, lovely. As far as anything else goes, do yourself a favor and watch the gag reel. I always find it interesting to see the deleted scenes and listen to the director's commentary on them but the commentary on the full film was a bit blah and I didn't bother going through it all.",8,0,1,13 February 2007
