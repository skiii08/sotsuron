The King's Speech," Incredible
","I can't really think of enough or superlative enough adjectives to describe 'The King's Speech.' Colin Firth plays Prince Albert, second in line to the throne of England. He has a terrible stammer and finds public speaking painful. His wife, the Duchess of York (Helena Bonham Carter) endeavors to help him. She finally finds a speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) who has been highly recommended. It's a difficult process for Albert; Logue wants to get at the psychological cause of the stammer, and the wooden Albert is interested only in the mechanics of speaking correctly. The relationship is volatile and on again/off again. Then King George V (Michael Gambon) dies, Albert's brother, Edward (Guy Pearce), abdicates, and Albert becomes King George VI.The wonderful screenplay by David Seidler has taken some dramatic license. The events in the film were moved up to the time just before Edward abdicates, making the important speech of King George VI at the beginning of World War II. In reality, these events happened in 1927, when Prince Albert made a speech in Australia. Logue, as the film indicates, worked with the King throughout the '30 and '40s. The change doesn't matter at all. The film is poignant, with some great touches of humor and fantastic performances, and the dramatic license makes Albert's plight all the more desperate.Colin Firth is magnificent as Albert/King George VI. A quiet man who adores his family, one can see the pain in his eyes and feel his anguish when he has to speak to anyone outside of his family. When Logue finally gets Albert to talk about the underlying reasons for his stammer, it's heartbreaking. Geoffrey Rush is sensational as Lionel Logue - witty, strict, and determined, he endeavors to treat Albert like any other student and break down his defenses. Helena Bonham Carter is lovely as the Duchess of York, portraying a lovely, gentle, caring woman who will do anything to help her husband and who suffers along with him. As George V, Michael Gambon is tough and scary, a hard man who challenges his second son because of the fears he holds about his first-born, the shallow Edward, being on the throne. There really aren't any off performances.The audience was with this film all the way and felt every moment. It's a fascinating time in the history of the royal family. If things had gone as planned - had Edward married someone acceptable and produced an heir, Albert and his family could have remained out of the limelight. King George V wanted desperately for Albert to be King and for 'Lilibet,' Queen Elizabeth II, to succeed him. That wouldn't have happened, since Edward outlived Albert by 20 years; in that scenario of Edward, heirless and King, Elizabeth would have become Queen 20 years later than she did.King George V was right - Edward was too weak and distracted to perform his duties as King of England. The right man - and the right line of the family - wound up with the job. RUN to the theater and see this magnificent film, beautifully directed by Tom Hooper.",10,4,8,8 January 2011
Saturday Night Fever," Resonates with a certain generation
","1977's 'Saturday Night Fever' is a movie that strongly resonates with a particular generation - mine. Five minutes of the movie brings it all back -- the disco era, the incredible Bee Gees music, and the charm, charisma and dance moves that was young John Travolta. If you were around then, you'll remember the cultural explosion this film caused. It simply defined the era, the way 'Flashdance,' an inferior film, did in a smaller way with the off one shoulder sweatshirt and music.For me watching this movie has the added plus of being a film about Brooklyn made in Brooklyn and New York City, where I lived. In fact, a young woman in my dance class is kissed by Travolta as he walks into the club. I can still remember how excited she was talking about it in class.It's the era of platform shoes, polyester shirts, and big blow-dried hair, and in the midst of it is a young Brooklyn man (Travolta) who has a gifted natural ability for dance is surrounded by friends heading nowhere and Italian-American parents who are afraid that he's just like his crowd. He finally realizes, thanks to his relationship with his pretty, uptown girl dance partner Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney), partly because of a tragedy, and partly because of his talent that he needs to stretch himself and move beyond his friends and neighborhood. As Stephanie says to him, 'You live with your parents, you hang with your buddies and on Saturday nights you burn it all off at 2001 Odyssey. You're a cliché. You're nowhere, going' no place.' As Tony Manero, John Travolta is a sexy number with his swiveling hips and white suit, and he has a neighborhood girl (Donna Pescow) in love with him, as well as one of his friends, Bobby (Barry Miller) who's gay and doesn't know it, but always shows off for Tony and cries when Tony doesn't call him.I love what Roger Ebert says about the effect of this film, which was his review partner Gene Siskel's favorite: 'We all have a powerful memory of the person we were at that moment when we formed a vision for our lives. Tony Manero stands poised precisely at that moment. He makes mistakes, he fumbles, he says the wrong things, but when he does what he loves he feels a special grace.' Directed with both realism and romance by John Badham, 'Saturday Night Fever,' especially for those of us who were young during the disco era, holds a very special place.",9,5,7,6 October 2012
Moneyball," changing the game
","I'm not a baseball fan, but 'Moneyball' from 2011 held my interest all the way through. In part, this was because of the acting, and in part, because the story is so intriguing.Brad Pitt is General Manager of the Oakland A's, and he's fighting some bad odds. He can't compete for the best players because the A's are financially constrained. He loses three stars to free agency after losing to the Yankees in the 2001 playoffs.Unable to squeeze more money out of the owner, Beane is then approached by Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), an economics graduate from Yale. Hill believes people have been thinking about the game all wrong. It's not about stars, it's about statistics. Beane goes along with this and puts together a team that looks like a real loser, full of has-beens and players no one is interested in. But they get on base and score runs.Beane's manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) thinks the whole idea is awful and refuses to use the players as intended. So they keep losing.Excellent look at how thinking about things differently can give great benefits. This statistical approach has changed the game as other teams have picked up this method. It's not about the stars, the people who look good whom everybody wants. And no one knows that better than Beane, a baseball prodigy who gave up college and was picked up by a team as its new star and then choked, never living up to his potential.An outstanding film, with Pitt giving a wonderful, understated performance. Pitt is an actor who, like many from Hollywood's golden Age, suffers from too-good looks and too much publicity about his private life. He's a solid actor who works internally and gives natural performances. Billy Beane is a perfect role for him, a man who, despite internal fears and doubts, stands up for what he believes in.Highly recommended.",8,1,2,1 January 2015
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Good fun if you suspend all semblance of reality
","Nicholas Cage, Jon Voight, Diane Kruger, Ed Harris, Harvey Keitel and Helen Mirren star in 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets,' a 2007 film that is a follow-up to the first 'National Treasure' movie.In this one, the team looks for the lost City of Gold as they search for clues on two continents that date back to the time of Lincoln's assassination. Also, Ben (Cage) wants to clear the name of his ancestor, who is brought to light as being part of Lincoln's assassination.Of course, it's all ridiculous, but extremely watchable and entertaining with a wonderful cast of fine actors and some good humor. Diane Kruger looks so much like Jessica Lange to me, it's uncanny. Love Helen Mirren always.This thing is just pure entertainment. If you take it on a realistic level, as if you're watching something like Schindler's List, you'll hate it. Don't bother with plot holes. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.",8,0,0,25 April 2010
Million Dollar Arm," great inspirational story
","Jon Hamm stars in 'Million Dollar Arm' from 2014, also with Lake Bell, Alan Arkin, Suraj Sharma, Madhur Mittal, Aasif Mandvi, Bill Paxton, and Darshan Jariwala. This is based on a true story.A down and nearly out agent, J. B. Bernstein, comes up with the idea of having a reality-show type competition finding Indian cricket players and turning them into pro baseball players in the U.S. He convinces one of his investors to go along with it.At first, it's hopeless, but eventually they find two young men with great arms, though they don't play cricket, Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel. They travel to the U.S. to train and then compete.It turns out to be more than just a competition, particularly for Bernstein, who realizes slowly that he's not doing his job right. He's treating the competition as a business and leaving the emotions of these boys dangling.Well made if predictable film and a wonderful feel-good story of these young men, far from their country, homesick, trying to adapt to Los Angeles, baseball, American food, and big homes; and it's also the story of a smart but desperate man who loses sight of what's important.Maybe I'm prejudiced, but I happen to think that Jon Hamm is an excellent actor. Granted, in the beginning, the character is closer to Don Draper in his shallowness; character differences are subtle. He's a little less formal and a little more energetic than Don. But like his Don Draper, his performance is multilayered. He's a very internalized actor, but when his character becomes angry, watch out.Alan Arkin is hilarious, and Lake Bell is just right as the medical student next door.The Indian actors do a tremendous job as young men taken out of their village and thrown into a strange world. They are totally convincing.I actually didn't recognize Bill Pullman as the team coach working with the competitors. He is quite good.Highly recommended.",8,0,0,15 April 2015
Angels & Demons," haven't read the book
","'Angels & Demons' precedes 'The Da Vinci Code' in literature, but in film it's reversed. I admit I haven't read either book, and I liked 'The Da Vinci Code' better. It was a more fascinating premise.'Angeles & Demons' is a magnificently produced, elaborate film starring Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Stellan Skarsgård.The emphasis here is on action and a fairly fast pace, with Hanks and Zurer racing all over Vatican City while angelic music plays. The plot concerns Robert Langdom (Hanks) being summoned by Rome after the Pope's death, and as the conclave of cardinals gather to elect a new one. It appears that the Illuminati, a secret brotherhood, wronged by the church, is now seeking revenge. The group has kidnapped four cardinals, - in fact, those thought to have the best chance of becoming Pope, intending to kill one an hour. They have also stolen an antimatter bomb from a science lab. Langdon is needed to interpret some ancient symbols and find the Illumination Path. In order to get the information he needs, Langdon has to arrange everything through the carmelango, Patrick McKenna (McGregor) who acts in absence of a pope. Along the way, Langdon realizes that there is probably an inside man at the Vatican helping the Illuminati.Hanks is in the film for his name value. He's very good, but to my mind, this isn't a particularly challenging role. It needs someone authoritative and mature who comes off as intelligent. Hanks fills all of those qualifications, as would David Strathairn or any number of other actors. Ayelet Zurer doesn't have much to do as the scientist trying to recover the antimatter bomb. Both Ewan McGregor and Armin Mueller-Stahl make great impressions in their roles. It's an excellent cast all around.Though filmed only partly on location, the whole thing comes off as a magnificent travelogue, and the soundtrack is haunting and beautiful.Definitely worth seeing though not nearly as provocative as 'The Da Vinci Code,' and if you can see it on a big flat TV screen, you'll like it even more. Today, we're used to seeing smaller, independent films, or films with big special effects. This movie has special effects, all right, but the huge budget also allows for the top drawer all the way, including gorgeous locations, an enormous cast, beautiful color, a top director, exotic lighting, stunning photography, and great music. The opportunities of seeing all of that in one film are becoming rarer and rarer.",7,0,0,29 November 2009
The Legend of Bagger Vance," beautiful, captivating film
","I haven't read any other reviews of this, but I'm surprised to see such a low rating.'The Legend of Bagger Vance' from 2000 is a Robert Redford movie about one of his favorite topics - sports. This time it's golf.The story begins with an elderly man (Jack Lemmon) having a heart attack while playing golf. Lying on the ground, he talks about his love of golf and tells a story set in the post-World War I era.In Savannah, there was a promising young golfer, Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) who went to fight in WW I and saw his entire battalion killed, except for him. He disappears, and does not return to Savannah for 15 years, and now spends his time drinking and playing cards. His old girlfriend Adele (Charlize Theron), never heard from him and has moved on with her life.Adele's father has died, and left her a fabulous resort area but no one can afford to visit these days of the Depression. But Adele knows there are still people with money out there. She decides to sell everything she owns and have a golf tournament between Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen (Joel Gretsch and Bruce McGill) with the prize being $10,000.Her board agrees but they want someone from Savannah to participate. A young boy, Hardy Greaves, who idolizes Rannulph, wants him to play and is in fact present when Adele tries to seduce Rannulph into playing. Eventually he gives in. But he finds he can't swing anymore.One night while practicing his swing in the dark, a vagrant named Bagger Vance (Will Smith) approaches him and offers to be his caddie for $5. What he shows Rannulph goes beyond his golf swing - it shows him to get through any challenge in life.This is a Field of Dreams type of film, and it's wonderful. It's about letting go of pain and learning who you are and what you can achieve, no matter the knocks you take in life. It's not only beautifully photographed but well directed and well acted.Will Smith is fantastic as the easygoing Bagger, his eyes and smile carrying the secret to life as he guides Rannulph. Charlize Theron has an outrageous southern accent, but she's very likable and beautiful. Matt Damon as Rannulph is a man burdened by the past, frustrated by the present, but with a winning smile who finally realizes he has to go for it.I have two problems with this film: One is, don't tell me Bobby Jones was that good-looking; and secondly, The Public Enemy, shown on a theater marquee, was released in 1931. Bobby Jones' last game, which he tells Rannulph this game will be, was in 1930.I thought the end was beautiful, particularly because this was Jack Lemmon's last film.I guess I don't understand a lot of the criticism about the movie being embarrassing. Perhaps I'm not as politically correct as I should be. I still thought it was a great movie.",9,1,2,17 October 2016
Love and Death," God is an underachiever
","Only Woody Allen could deem God an underachiever - at best - but he does in his 1975 'War and Peace' takeoff, 'Love and Death,' also starring Diane Keaton. Allen's relationship with God, faith and morality has been explored in both his comedies and his dramas, and this story of two peasants in Tsarist Russia who set out to kill Napoleon is no exception. The film begins with a narration by Boris (Allen) as he awaits execution (it was supposed to be a 5 a.m. but a good lawyer got him an hour's reprieve), and he explains how he wound up in prison.There are some hilarious moments in this movie, filmed in Hungary, but the comedy comes off as uneven and even at an hour and a half, it seems long. In an interview, Allen said that he imitated Bob Hope spewing one-liners. One of the most interesting parts of the film is to hear him do exactly that and how different the Hope-type patter sounds when channeled by Allen. (Don Adams' 'Get Smart' voice was an imitation of William Powell; Paul Lynde was imitating Alice Ghostley, yet this probably never occurs to anyone.) Boris' discussions about murder and morality with his wife, the promiscuous Sonja, are very funny. He and Keaton make a great team.Allen comes down on the side of no God or if there is one, as stated previously, he's an underachiever. In fact, there is even a lying angel. Drama or comedy, Allen's films are usually thought-provoking, even hidden behind his non-Hope deadpan line readings and nebbishy face. His work is always worth seeing, and the cleverness and art of 'Love and Death' will not be lost on the viewer.",7,2,2,27 October 2008
Frost_Nixon," excellent performances, excellent screenplay
","Peter Morgan adapted his wonderful stage play Frost/Nixon for film with tremendous success. Directed by Ron Howard and starring Michael Sheen as David Frost and Frank Langella as Nixon, it tells the behind-the-scenes story of the famous series of interviews.For all many of us who lived through the Nixon presidency and Watergate, this is not the stuff of nostalgia or happy reminiscence. And when the Nixon tapes were published and his bigotry against just about everyone was revealed in explicit 'expletive deleted' language, it was time to get disgusted all over again.Here, portrayed by Frank Langella, we see Nixon as a lonely, vulnerable, angry, and bitter human being, a man who's made a bed he must sleep in for the next twenty years. We also see a manipulative and highly intelligent individual who, despite a great deal of success, had no self-worth. It's the feeling of being an outsider, of never being good enough, that led him to some atrocious decisions.It's Langella's performance and Michael Sheen's wonderful performance as David Frost -- playboy, comedian, talk show host, and party-giver turned investigative journalist -- that anchor 'Frost/Nixon.' They are given great support by Kevin Bacon as Nixon's protective assistant, Jack Brennan, Sam Rockwell as James Reston, determined that Nixon pay for Watergate, as well as Oliver Platt, Matthew Mcfadyen, and Toby Jones.I found the determination of Frost as he attempted to raise financing for the interviews and get networks interested -- with no luck -- very admirable and inspiring. And his gut instinct paid off for him big time.I transcribed an interview with Nixon that took place in his home in the 1980s, as well as a speech he made during one of the Presidential election periods. He was a brilliant speaker, and as an interviewee, when the interview was over, he engaged the reporter in a very friendly personal conversation. In the end, both those listening experiences made me sad, as did this film. For everything he achieved, Richard Nixon had undeveloped gifts and potential. He robbed the world of a lot more than the ability to trust government. But in the end, as the film shows, he robbed himself the most.",8,3,3,15 July 2011
Walk the Line," Portrait of an artist's journey and his great love
","'Walk the Line' is the story of Johnny Cash, and it's based on two autobiographies of the great singer. Its stars are Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, Robert Patrick, Ginnifer Goodwin and Dallas Roberts. The story begins with Cash (Phoenix) contemplating an electric saw at Folsom Prison as he flashes back to what brought him there. The flashback brings the viewer full circle: through Johnny's young life with his family, who are cotton pickers; the horrific death of his brother; the resentment of his father who yells 'The wrong son died.' Cash, absent from the scene when his brother died, carried feelings of guilt around for years afterward. The film continues with Cash's military life, his first guitar, the beginning of his song writing, an early marriage, children, the odd jobs he did while waiting to make it as a singer; his audition with Sam Phillips who tells him, 'I can't sell gospel' and Cash's singing of his own music; a back-breaking tour schedule and the meeting of his long-time idol, the vivacious, talented June Carter, already well known with her family on the circuit; alcohol, drugs, infidelity, his great love for June who is his rock, and finally, redemption.Thanks to superb performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who do their own singing and play their own instruments, 'Walk the Line' soars, keeping the viewer absorbed in the life of this incredibly talented man throughout. Sam Phillips' unique ability to spot a superstar is unparalleled - Cash was his first discovery after Elvis. Early photographs of Cash at Sun Records show a thin man with a shy smile and 5 o'clock shadow at the beginning of his success. That beautiful baritone voice that sounded like it had endured life's tortures, the constant wearing of black, his songs that spoke to America, made him an icon. Predictably, success was hard to handle - there were women, there was exhaustion on the tour - so there were uppers and alcohol. And there was June, the bright light at the end of his black tunnel.This is first and foremost a great love story. It could have been a run of the mill biopic. Instead, it's beautifully directed by James Mangold, who gives great attention to detail and atmosphere and keeps the story going. Reese Witherspoon deservedly won an Oscar for her portrayal of June Carter. Tiny, energetic, and strong, she's like a magnet for the viewer. All eyes are on June with her sunny smile. Reese's accent is perfect since she's from New Orleans - it becomes part of her character instead of being a distraction. Though petite, she looms taller than Cash.Joaquin Phoenix is a fantastic Cash. What else can be said - it's nice to have a great June, but there's no movie without a great Johnny. He's very convincing throughout Cash's pain and struggles. One thing that is impressive is Phoenix's use of his energy. He would somewhat underplay and when it came time for Cash to lose his temper - WOW - it really hits the viewer and is a great demonstration of Cash's volatility. The actor actually pulled the sink out of the wall in an unscripted moment in one of the scenes.X-Files star Robert Patrick has a nice role here as Cash's father, and he's excellent as a violent man who shuts down after the death of his child and carries resentment with him wherever he goes. The little scene at the end of the film is a wonderful moment.I had only two complaints about this film. One, it ran just a little too long. The second thing is something I could be wrong about and probably am. One of Elvis' band gives Cash uppers while both he and Presley are on tour in the mid-'50s. It is my understanding from Peter Guarlnick's fantastic book, 'Last Train to Memphis' that Elvis didn't start on uppers until he was in the army having to do night duty. It was then that he also noticed it helped his weight.Minor complaints about a brilliant film. Highly, highly recommended.",9,1,1,4 March 2007
The Monuments Men," great story not particularly well done
","Someone who read this book described it as riveting. This is not a term I would use for 2014's Monuments Men, despite a wonderful cast that included George Clooney, Matt Damon, John Goodman, Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville, and finally, George's father, Nick Clooney.The story concerns the real-life Monuments Men, who are assigned the job of saving as much art from the Nazis as possible. The Nazis, as has been highly publicized, stole art belonging to Jews, and pilfered valuable art, sculptures, and church icons from churches and museums.The suspense and excitement come in bits and pieces. There are some stunning scenes as the soldiers go into mines and discover huge numbers of treasures. There are also some moving scenes, particularly concerning the character of Donald (Bonneville).We really don't find out too much about the soldiers, but the script has a lot of humor and repartee in it, making it like the Oceans Eleven films Clooney stars in with Damon and others. A little of it is fine and even necessary, but there isn't enough pathos to offset it.The best scene for me took place in the home of the dentist's son.In reality, 350 soldiers made up the Monuments Men. It's only seven here.This is one of those films about a fascinating, important, and interesting subject that makes one want to learn more about it. Unfortunately, despite some good scenes, Monuments Men isn't good enough to convey the layers of this amazing story.",7,0,2,27 February 2015
Mission: Impossible III," Non-stop action
","It's interesting to consider why films based on TV series usually don't work, and why a few have. Most of the time, the film versions don't have a lot of respect for the TV series. If you don't remember the TV series, the movie is a bore; if you do remember the TV series, the movie makes you angry.The 'Mission: Impossible' franchise works as well as it does because, while it uses new names, it gets its ideas for the original show. The music is the same; the way the head of the IMF team gets his info is the same; he works with a team; everything is synchronized, with each team member playing an important part. It's fast, escapist, and the plots are totally outrageous.In MI III, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) comes out of retirement to go after one of his trainees (Keri Russell) who has been on the trail of an arms dealer, Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffmann). Though he and his team (Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and Maggie Q) manage to save her, she dies. After the funeral, Ethan receives mail from her with a microdot and finds out that one of the IMF bosses, Brassel (Laurence Fishburne) is actually a mole. Ethan and his team decide to go after Davian themselves, get what he's selling, and find out to whom he's selling it.This is an extremely exciting film that goes at breakneck speed. The movie actually starts at a crucial moment in the film, and then takes the audience back to how that point was reached. There are several twists on hand as well.All of the acting is good. I've never been a particular fan of Tom Cruise, but like a lot of stars, he has a physicality that makes him effective. He does very well in this type of genre. Keri Russell has a small but very good role, and she does well. The excellent Jonathan Rhys Meyers doesn't haven't nearly enough to do - in the last two years, he's come quite a distance. Ving Rhames is great as is Philip Seymour Hoffmann, but isn't he always.Very thrilling.",8,0,2,8 December 2008
The Finest Hours," Exciting and suspenseful
","'The Finest Hours' from 2016 is a true story of an incident in 1952.In February of 1952, an intense, powerful storm hit New England. On that day, an oil tankers splits in half. Hearing the distress signal, the commander, Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) sends Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) and his handpicked crew on a rescue mission, which almost certainly means death. Bernie is not popular - he was unable to rescue men at another time, though his friends assure him there was nothing he could have done. The engineer, Sybert (Casey AFfleck) takes over, determined to run the stern to ground so that it will not sink. He has to convince the men not to try to leave in the lifeboats, which will not hold up in the storm. He holds fast and fights them.As the storm rages, Bernie and his men forge ahead to find survivors.Very exciting movie with stupendous effects and excellent performances by Chris Pine and Casey Affleck. But what was the stupid love story doing in there? Holliday Grainger is Miriam Webber, whom Bernie meets on a blind date. After several months, she pushes him to marry her, and they decide on an April wedding. Well, she does.When Bernie is out on his rescue mission, Miriam shows up at headquarters demanding he be ordered back immediately. Not only does she act inappropriately but she is as annoying as hell. She comes through in the end, but this entire story did not belong in the movie. Their love story was not built up enough to see anything between them except her iron will. She makes Bernie look like a wuss.The '50s were meticulously presented with the historical references correct. I always watch out for that - references and songs etc. were right on.'The Finest Hours' is a Disney film, and at the end of the film, it catches the viewer up with the real people. Very interesting. Well worth watching, and well directed by Craig Gillespie except for the way the love story was handled.",8,0,1,20 November 2016
Source Code," fascinating film employing quantum physics theory
","Jake Gyllenhaal is the 'Source Code' in this 2011 film, also starring Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, and Jeffrey Wright. Gyllenhaal plays a soldier named Colter Stevens, a pilot who actually died in Afghanistan. However, he is now on a train in someone else's body, part of a project that can put someone in another person's conscious mind but only for the last eight minutes of his life, which the brain retains. He has been put in the mind of one of the passengers. The train is going to blow up, and the terrorist is going to blow up another venue in Chicago later in the day and kill even more people. His assignment is to find out who the bomber is so that the government can stop the second bombing.Stevens is sent back as the train passenger over and over, unable to get information on the bomber's identity. He falls for his traveling companion (Monaghan) and becomes determined to stop the first bombing so that she and the other passengers will not be killed. He is told, however, that he has not gone back in time and cannot change what has already happened.Fascinating film that takes the theories behind quantum physics and pushes them into the realm of science fiction - though scientists are actually studying some of the ideas put forth in the movie.As Stevens, Jake Gyllenhaal does a terrific job as a confused man who is having trouble with the different realities he is thrust into; Vera Farmiga is very good as the person running the experiment, who bonds with Stevens, seeing him as a human being instead of an experiment. Michelle Monaghan resembles a young version of the actress Terry Farrell (and I remember when she was young) and is very good as the passenger's traveling companion.The end is thought-provoking and asks just what science will be able to accomplish as the years go on. Do we live in parallel universes? Is the past, present, and future all happening at once? Can we change the past and therefore change the future? Who knows, but it's interesting to think about.",Null,0,2,21 August 2011
Skyfall," mindless fun
","I'm not an expert on the Bond canon, but I love Daniel Craig, especially after seeing him on stage in A Steady Rain, and I admire much of Sam Mendes' work.I found Skyfall to be fun and exciting. It cost a fortune and looked it.Nothing original about the plot - a stolen list of agents - this is the latest plot for many spy films. Also I agree with one of the reviews here that I read - the list just seems to get forgotten about.What I can't believe is that people pick these films apart as if they're supposed to be realistic. There is nothing realistic about them, so why ask why Naomi only had one bullet etc. In these types of films, you have to just go with them.Judi Dench as M, who is in danger here, is marvelous, and Javier Bardem is an absolute scary, crazy scream as Bond's nemesis. Daniel Craig is wonderfully handsome and in excellent shape. He's a brilliant actor and totally wasted in these films, but I suppose the money is fantastic.Ralph Fiennes lets his receding hairline show and drops his leading man status here, and he gives a steely performance.There are enough explosions, car chases, fights, shootings, and train wrecks to last a lifetime. But it's nonstop action and nonstop entertainment. Don't analyze this type of film too much. Just go along for the ride and hope someone doesn't blow up the car.",8,2,21,12 November 2012
Catch Me If You Can," Great story + two marvelous actors + a brilliant director -= recipe for entertainment
","Leonardo DiCaprio is the nemesis of an FBI agent, and vice versa, in 'Catch Me If You Can,' a 2002 film starring Tom Hanks and directed by Steven Spielberg. Based on a true story, DiCaprio is the young Frank Abagnale, a great impostor who teaches school, becomes a pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer as he floats bad checks all over the country and seems to be impossible to capture.The film is beautifully paced by Spielberg and absolutely fascinating as you wait and see what Abagnale is going to do next. When his father gets in trouble with the IRS, the family lifestyle changes, and Frank has to go to a public high school. He insists on wearing his private school jacket on his first day. He promptly takes over a French class as the substitute teacher and dismisses the real one, saying there must be a mistake. When he's discovered, his parents are called in. 'Frank has been teaching French for the past week,' the principal tells them. 'Today he scheduled a field trip to a French bread-making factory. You see my problem.' His father (Christopher Walken) admires his son's chicanery but refuses to take advantage of it, even as his financial state worsens.Tom Hanks is Hanratty, the FBI agent who chases Abagnale all over the world. He is fabulous as a lonely, hard-working, insightful man who gets a call in his office from Frank every Christmas. 'I know why you called me,' he says to Frank. 'You don't have anyone else to call.' The two develop a strange bond. The baby-faced DiCaprio does a magnificent job as Frank. He's totally magnetic, charming, and also sad, exhibiting Frank's pain over his parents' divorce and his father's downfall. His goal is to get 'everything back again' but then it becomes a game he can't quit. As his father, Walken is excellent as a proud man faced with the loss of his property, income, and family.A well-cast, expertly directed film all the more intriguing since it's based on a true story. The opening scene is Frank Abagnale's appearance on 'To Tell the Truth.' We don't get to see if he fooled the audience, but he probably did - telling the truth is something Frank, while on the run, never did particularly well.",9,0,2,19 July 2007
Marie Antoinette," Beautiful bore
","Kirsten Dunst is 'Marie Antoinette' in this anachronistic 2006 film directed by Sofia Coppola. The other stars include Jason Schwartzman, Rip Torn, Judy Davis, Marianne Faithful and Molly Shannon.I can only guess that the reason for making this film was to show a teenage Queen of France cavorting with her girlfriends and shopping until she dropped while remaining oblivious to the plight and unhappiness of the French people. In actuality, that's probably pretty close to the truth about this historical figure. Norma Shearer was very good as Marie Antoinette, but she wasn't a kid. I think this version had the right idea. The only thing Coppola omitted was Marie's story, so the movie is instead about the above-mentioned teen partying, shopping, being unfaithful, wandering the grounds, while giving us a look at royal tradition, gorgeous costumes and dazzling scenery. Little else.Marie Antoinette's life was full of drama - her liaisons with Axel von Fersen, the Affair of the Necklace, her husband's medical problem which prevented the couple from having children for so long, the revolution, the family being taken to prison, and the guillotine. Some of this is touched on or mentioned in passing; most of it is left out. There are five exciting minutes or so toward the end of the film.In a way, it's a shame, because this film could have given us great insight into Marie Antoinette by having a very young woman play the Queen as these events swirled around her. But in order to do that, characters would have to have been developed, and there didn't seem to be any interest in that. If you love color, beautiful costumes and scenery, this is the film for you. Don't bother if you're looking for any kind of content; like the vacuous queen, there's no there there.",6,3,4,6 November 2007
United 93," Shattering and worth seeing
","'United 93' tells the story of the one flight on 9/11 that did not hit its designated target because of the heroism of the passengers. Writer/director Paul Greengrass tells the story documentary-style, with many of the actual airline and military personnel taking part in the filming.There were many New York actors whom I recognized, but most people won't be cognizant at all that they're watching actors.Several things emerge as especially striking. The first is how completely blindsided we were and because the situation was so horrible, how long it took to realize what was going on. The second was the realization among the passengers, quietly growing, that this was it. The third is the no-nonsense activism of the passengers, who just weren't going to sit still and take it. What brave people they were.The most incredible part of 'United 93' is the special feature where each actor meets the family of the person they're playing. To see how the families have coped over the years and what the film meant to them made for extremely emotional viewing.I noticed a few of the comments said that it was understandable if someone couldn't watch this movie, and of course, it is. I had to ask myself why I was willing to watch it. I guess because I believed that all the victims of 9/11 weren't victims at all, but very special people. You won't doubt that after you watch the film or the special feature.",10,5,9,24 August 2009
Deja Vu," A wormhole movie
","An ATF officer (Denzel Washington) goes four days into the past to stop an explosion in which many people were killed, as well as stop the murder of a beautiful young woman (Paula Patton). Tony Scott directed, and the film also stars Val Kilmer, Jim Caviezel, and Bruce Greenwood.For such a simple plot, it sure is a complicated movie, but totally absorbing. Someone on this site called it a 'wormhole movie' - I never knew there was such a genre, and I come into this as a newbie. I had to do some reading after the film to figure out some of the plot points. I don't know if it was me or the film, so I split the difference and gave it an 8. I think the audiences more used to this type of film can figure it out much more easily. I don't want to say too much and give it away for those who haven't seen it. Just pay attention.Scott and Washington make a great team. There's lots of suspense, excitement, mystery, and special effects.Some time ago, I sat in a room of people watching 'The Constant Gardner' and had to explain the plot as the film went along. I can't imagine watching this film with that crowd! Fascinating, entertaining, and well worth it.",8,0,1,18 September 2009
Minority Report," Excellent futuristic film
","Tom Cruise is the star of 'Minority Report,' a 2002 film from Steven Spielberg. Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, Steve Harris, Lois Smith, Neal McDonough and Jessica Capshaw also star. Cruise is John Anderton, a futuristic cop at a time when murders can be prevented by being predicted ahead of time by three precogs. When the precogs see him kill someone he doesn't know, he attempts to find out who has set him up and why and keep the murder from happening.'Minority Report' has a clever script beautifully handled by Spielberg. (The title refers to a report generated when all three precogs don't have the same vision of events.) Some of the effects are awesome, and one can easily see them becoming realities in the future. Newspaper headlines change before your eyes, disks are in the form of holograms, the images that the precogs see are projected, and the police see the whole event by moving their hands around the screen. People travel using jet packs. Everyone is identified by retinal scans. In one scene, Anderton, on the run from his own unit, has his eyes removed and new ones inserted so he can go around without being recognized. He is also given something that can place under his chin and dramatically alter his face for a very short time. There are some very exciting and tense scenes, as well as some poignant ones - Anderton goes home at night and puts a hologram into the computer that brings back his dead son. His vulnerability in that area will bring him more grief.The cinematography is very unusual, giving the film its own special look. There are tributes throughout to film noir and Kubrick.This is a thrilling film with excellent performances, with Samantha Morton a standout as Agatha, the most sensitive precog, who is kidnapped by Anderton to help him uncover the truth. She is amazing. I am not always impressed by Tom Cruise. As an actor, he is somewhat external; however, it works very well in this type of slick film. Von Sydow is always good. And it was wonderful to see handsome Neal McDonough of Boomtown. Lois Smith has one big scene, and she comes off as both eccentric and mysterious.The future may be closer than we think. Don't miss this provocative, suspenseful and disturbing film from one of the great cinematic masters.",8,1,3,26 June 2007
Lifeboat," small Hitchcock film that packs a wallop
","A drama teacher once told me a personality functioning is much more interesting than an actor. We don't have personalities functioning so much anymore - the Bette Davises, the Katharine Hepburns -- but 'Lifeboat' demonstrates the truth of that statement with one of the great personalities, Tallulah Bankhead.On film in the early '30s, Bankhead wasn't as effective as she is here, mainly because she played ordinary roles that anyone could have played. Here, the stunning actress plays a journalist, Constance Porter, as filtered through Tallulah -- in a mink, sitting on the boat with a typewriter, a camera, and wearing a Cartier bracelet, as she addressed everyone as 'darling.'Hitchcock's 'Lifeboat' was a World War II film about a group of people stranded in a lifeboat after the Germans sink their ship. The stars, besides Bankhead, are John Hodiak, Hume Cronyn, William Bendix, Mary Anderson, Henry Hull, Canada Lee, and Walter Slezak as the Nazi who hitches a ride and nearly outsmarts them all - quite a statement during the war.It's a story of disparate people working together trying to survive through horrific weather conditions at times, injuries, hunger, and thirst, and then being virtually taken over by a Superman who sings in German and can row the boat, probably toward a German supply ship instead of Bermuda. 'So we're all going to fold up and die,' Constance says to the passengers when they have lost hope. 'We not only let the Nazi do our rowing for us, but our thinking!'The acting is wonderful, from Hume Cronyn as a Cockney, Slezak as the cruel German, macho John Hodiak coming on to Constance, and beautiful Mary Anderson as a troubled young woman. Especially poignant was William Bendix's performance as Gus, a regular guy in love with a good-time girl named Rosie.A very exciting film, done in the days before special effects -- it's a tribute to Hitchcock's ingenuity.",10,1,2,11 April 2016
Training Day," A corrupt man in a corrupt world
","Ethan Hawke has a 'Training Day' - from hell - and learns that his trainer (Denzel Washington) is way out there in this 2001 film directed by Antoine Fuqua. Featured in the film are Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, Eva Mendes, and Snoop Dogg.Hawke is a young family man, Jake, who is teamed up with a decorated narcotics detective, Alonzo, to see if Jake has what it takes to work the street and go undercover. Alonzo is a very unsettling guy - joking one minute, mean the next - and Jake doesn't know quite how to take him. He just knows the job means a lot to him.Gradually it dawns on him that a) Alonzo is more corrupt than any of the perpetrators he says he's after; and b) he's setting Jake up so that he's part of some dirty work and therefore won't be able to talk.Really top-notch, edgy performance from Denzel Washington, who is always full of surprises, here playing an unpredictable character. This was his Oscar winning role, and it was deserved, though there's no question that he deserved it in the past too. The film is full of action, violence, and really raw characters - one certainly gets a sense of the mean streets from watching this film. Ethan Hawke acts just as a man who doesn't know what's going on would - unsure, embarrassed, nervous, scared, but very determined and quick-thinking, as he realizes what he's gotten himself into.Shocking, violent, bloody, and fast - that about sums it up. Some excellent performances along the way, too, from everyone involved.",7,1,2,30 July 2009
In Bruges," A new place for purgatory
","Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason are 'In Bruges,' a 2008 film directed by Martin McDonagh.Farrell and Gleason are Ray and Ken, two hit men sent to Bruges, Belgium to await instructions on their next hit from their boss Yuri (Ralph Fiennes). Ken (Gleason) loves the fairytale prettiness and medieval sites of the town, but Farrell, a volatile and troubled young man, is bored out of his mind. He perks up a little when he meets a pretty drug dealer and makes a date with her. It gets to be kind of messy, though, when he takes offense at the restaurant and beats up a fellow patron, and then at her place, her boyfriend.Ken is at the hotel to receive the call on the next hit, and it's on Ray. The boss was trying to show him a nice time in a pretty place before he dies. The reason? On his first hit, which was in a church on a priest, one of Farrell's bullets hit a child. Not only can't Farrell recover from it, but Fiennes wants him gone.Though this is a dark film, it has a great deal of humor, mostly provided by Farrell's excellent performance as the reckless Ray. The director, McDonagh, has skillfully enmeshed both the comedy and the drama together and woven the idea of heaven, hell, and purgatory into the story. For Ken, Bruges is his idea of heaven, peaceful and beautiful. For Ray, since they're stuck there for two weeks, it's purgatory.'In Bruges' is a beautiful film about guilt, camaraderie, and the possibility of redemption. It's depressing but not completely. And the scenery, despite what Ray thinks, is beautiful.",8,0,4,8 May 2012
Gravity," the art of the moment
","'Gravity' is a gorgeous film that must be seen in a theater, unless you happen to have the world's largest screen at home and 3D capability.I have to say up front that I didn't see it in 3D because I have no depth perception and wouldn't be able to see it anyway. But it must have been mind-boggling because without the 3D, it was pretty stunning.Not much here in the way of story -- Sandra Bullock plays a woman literally lost in space and trying to find her way back to earth, via a shuttle that's rather far off.The neat thing for me about this film is that the director took his time with the moments rather than rushing through and trying to have an action sequence every two seconds. We watch Bullock, alone, as she goes through various thought processes and attempts to figure out what to do. One rarely sees that type of thing anymore.Bullock is excellent, and it's a great role for her - adventurous, athletic, and emotional with a few light moments. George Clooney's role is small, but he's likable.For me, though, the star of this film was the beauty and the silence - something that we're not used to today. The silence of space, the idea of complete aloneness...a really beautiful movie.",8,3,9,17 October 2013
To Be or Not to Be," A Lubitsch comedy masterpiece
","Just the thought of Jack Benny walking onto a stage as Hamlet is enough to send anyone into spasms of laughter. That he does - and a lot more -in 'To Be or Not to Be,' a 1942 film about the Lunt and Fontanne (Benny and Carole Lombard) of Poland, Josef and Maria Tura, as they go up against the Nazis. Circumstances make it necessary for the acting troupe to pose as Nazi guards and officers and for Maria to pretend to romance one of Hitler's main men in order to head off a Nazi spy (Stanley Ridges).This film is absolutely hilarious, with several running bits, including Maria telling a young soldier (Robert Stack) that he can visit her dressing room when Josef starts his big speech. When Josef says, 'To be or not to be,' the soldier stands up and leaves the theater, making Josef believe the man is simply walking out on his performance. This goes on throughout the film. Robert Stack is so young he's virtually unrecognizable.The supporting cast is excellent, doubling beautifully as actors - one of whom longs to play Shylock (Felix Bressart) but carries a sword instead and one who wants a chance to play Hitler (Tom Dugan) - and as Nazis. Sig Ruman plays the buffoonish Col. Ehrhardt.However funny 'To Be or Not to Be' is, and it's wonderfully funny, Lubitsch manages to make his point that war is scary and tragic when the audience is shown the Warsaw stores closed and the streets nothing but rubble. There was nothing remotely amusing about the Nazi occupation of Poland, but 1942 audiences, while being reminded of this, were allowed to laugh and forget their troubles for a little while. The laughter doesn't last long, especially since Carole Lombard died in a plane crash so shortly after the film's release. That marred the legacy of 'To Be or Not to Be,' but today, we should see it for the classic that it is.",10,0,1,30 April 2008
The Big Lebowski," for baby boomers - The Dude abides
","I'm not sure The Big Lebowski is for everyone, but for my money it's one of the funniest comedies ever, a very impressive production from the Coen Brothers.Over the years, the Coens have knocked my socks off. They have their heavy-duty films like No Country for Old Men, Barton Fink, and their satires like the Hudsucker Proxy - it seems as if they can do anything.This is a very, very funny and offbeat film with crazy characters, acid flashbacks, and bizarre situations -- a true baby boomer movie about The Dude (Jeff Bridges) whose name is Jeff Lebowski, who is mistaken for another Lebowski whose wife owes money all over town. Goons try to get the money from him; he winds up working for the other Lebowski when his porn star wife is kidnapped. Along for the ride are two of his bowling buddies, Walter, a Vietnam vet who, though not Jewish, observes the shabbat, and Steve (Steve Buscemi). Julianne Moore plays Maude, the daughter of the Big Lebowski. My favorite part of the movie -- I have many, but my favorite part is one of the last scenes which I won't give away. The acting is fantastic, with Jeff Bridges totally inhabiting the Dude and John Goodman in one of his best performances.A flop when it opened, over the years, The Big Lebowski has deservedly become a classic as it found its audience. It's now rated in the top 250 on IMDb, which is only right.",10,1,6,9 July 2000
Unbreakable," intriguing
","Needless to say, after Sixth Sense, I watched this film with high expectations.  Though it's no Sixth Sense, M. Night is one of the most interesting storytellers around. He manages to hold the audience's interest even with a rather slow pace which somehow didn't feel boring. This is a film about skewed perspective - we see constant images of things upside down.  It's about opposites - comic book heroes and villains, ying and yang. And, as seems to be M. Night's trademark, it's about surprises.  I'll take one of his movies over any overhyped junk any day.",8,0,1,14 September 2001
Star Trek," Let the games begin
","Okay, I'm not a Trekkie, so I can't go into depth about the Romulans, the Klingons, yada yada. I will leave that for the die-hard fans who either loved or hated this film.'Star Trek,' from 2009, shows us the young Kirk and Spock, along with Bones, Chekov, Ahura, etc. It starts out with James Kirk Sr. meeting his death in space but managing to get his pregnant wife off the ship; then it shows us the wild child James Jr., and then later as a student, coming up against Spock before they even board ship.I have to say, I really enjoyed this story, as the fleet fights a Romulan time traveler, who is creating black holes to destroy the Federation planets, one by one. I think Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, and the rest of the cast do an excellent job as the younger versions of the characters from the '60s TV series, with Quinto especially as a standout. And it was a kick to see Leonard Nimoy as the old Spock as well.I feel there was an attempt to remain faithful to the '67 series, with Bruce Greenwood as Christopher Pike, and Mrs. Roddenberry, Majel Barrett, doing a voice-over.J.J. Abrams is smart in this and the next film to focus on the relationship between Kirk and Spock. He continually brings both films back to it; in this film, it's an unsteady pairing that evolves over time.The special effects are spectacular - you wouldn't expect anything less from a big Hollywood film.Star Trek is a very successful franchise, much more successful, I feel, than Star Wars once the first big three films were done.",8,1,2,5 July 2013
Fight Club," Quite an accomplishment
","Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are in the 'Fight Club,' a 1999 film directed by David Fincher and written by Jim Uhls. The movie also stars Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Zach Grenier.Edward Norton is Jack, the Narrator of the film (though there is some controversy over his name). Tired of his job, his life, and his boss, he finds great satisfaction by attending group sessions for alcoholics, drug addicts,compulsive gamblers, compulsive eaters, cancer victims, etc. He soon encounters another group groupie, the bizarre Marla Singer (Carter), and realizes that when she's in a group with him, he has no release of his feelings. So the two make a deal and split up the meetings and the nights they attend.When Jack returns from a trip, his apartment is in flames. With nowhere to go, he calls a man he met on the plane, Tyler Durden, and goes to live with him in an old, decrepit, filthy house. The two soon become involved in forming an underground Fight Club, where Jack finds the release he seeks, learns who he is as a man, and develops assertiveness and courage.Okay, like 'Mulholland Drive,' that's the story on the surface, but the film isn't really about what was described above. It's a complicated, dark, violent story about tearing down superficial values, ripping into rampant consumerism, and really feeling and living instead of existing.'Fight Club' starts off as quite funny, actually, with Jack and Marla arguing over who's going to the prostate cancer meeting, and becomes progressively darker, stranger, and faster as it races to a surprising ending. Unfortunately for me, it took me too long to see the film, so the ending wasn't such a surprise. I would have loved to experience the full impact of it.The performances from Norton, Pitt, and Carter are fabulous. All three are shown to their absolute best advantage. Norton for some reason is always a little underrated. He does a beautiful job. Carter years ago made a seamless transition from ingénue to leading lady, and this, like Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd, is more of a character role.'Fight Club' is horrific to watch in parts because of the violence, but it's worth getting through it to see a truly masterful film.",10,2,7,2 September 2010
Darkest Hour," a dark time in history
","Passionate, rousing film about the dark days of May 1940, when Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) became prime minister and resisted the idea of peace negotiations with Germany.I suppose hindsight is 20/20 but honestly - Hitler takes Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium , and was on his way to France, who had no defense planned (how many Frenchmen does it take to defend Paris from attack - answer, no one knows, it's never happened), and there were people in Parliament that thought Hitler would negotiate a peace treaty.After taking over from Neville Chamberlain, Churchill finds himself alone in wanting England to defend itself. His speeches rally the people, and in the end, England fights.Now, it's never good to get your history from the movies. Films take dramatic license, combine characters, events, and telescope time to make a compelling story. There are a few things here that are fictional, the biggest one being Churchill going into the subway. That should have been cut.Also, history tells us that although in the film, Churchill agrees to at least listen to a proposed peace agreement - in reality, he never considered it and never agreed to it. Chamberlain is depicted saying he is dying of cancer; Chamberlain never told anyone he had cancer because he was never told that himself.The portrait of Churchill certainly matches what has been read and said about him. As everyone knows, Gary Oldman was magnificent. The rest of the cast did well, but it was Oldman's show.The most impressive thing to me about this film was the director (Joe Wright's) ability to capture the tension, the pressure, and the fright of what Britain was facing - alone - since the U.S. wouldn't do anything. For FDR it was all about Russia, and in the end, we see that Russia was handed eastern Europe. The forces against Churchill are depicted as overwhelming - one historian suggests that there probably weren't the loud shouting matches as depicted, but certainly a great deal of discussion.",8,1,2,6 October 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Completely unexpected
","When I decided to watch this film, I was clueless about it. The ads suggested that it was a comedy. It is, but not in the way one would think. I also didn't realize that it was directed by Quentin Tarantino. So basically, the whole thing was a surprise for me.In many ways, 'Inglourious Basterds' is a good surprise. It's an intriguing, interesting, highly fictional story, with tension throughout, especially in the beginning scene where Colonel Landa (Christoph Waltz) questions a French farmer (Denis Menochet) about hiding a Jewish family.The Basterds, led by Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) are out to scalp Germans, and their mission collides with that of a Jewish woman (Melanie Laurent) who has fake papers and runs a film theater in Paris. She has a mission, too, and on the night a film is shown that is to be attended by Hitler and SS officers, the plans take effect.Brad Pitt is very funny as Aldo, and Christoph Waltz gives a great performance as Landa. Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, playing a German actress who is collaborating with the Americans, are both wonderful in their roles.'Inglourious Basterds' is filled with horrible violence done as only Tarantino can - you're laughing one minute and repulsed the next - it also has an excellent cast. Tarantino reminds us of the flammability of nitrate and of life, which in this film is pretty cheap.I don't want to give anything away. As with all films, take it for what it is, fictional with plot holes, and you will be entertained.",8,0,3,9 April 2010
Two for the Money," Pacino and McConaughey - an odd pair
","Al Pacino stars with Matthew McConaughey and Rene Russo in 'Two for the Money,' a 2005 film directed by D.J. Caruso.Pacino plays Walter Abrams, a man with a serious heart condition, a wife, and a child. As his wife says, 'he's held together by meetings. If it has an 'anonymous' after its name, he goes to it.' A former compulsive gambler, he now runs a sports betting business. He becomes interested in a former football player, retired due to a knee injury, named Brandon Lang (McConaughey). Lang gives out accurate predictions and point spreads on a 900 line, and Abrams invites Lang to work for him.Lang moves to New York, where Abrams changes his name to John Anthony, dresses him professionally, and ultimately puts him on television. Anthony is very successful - the business gets a percentage of every win, and Anthony does very well by his clients.Unfortunately, as Abrams himself says, Anthony is not a psychic - which Anthony seems to forget, becoming too interested in golf games with his clients instead of research, and the inevitable happens. 'John Anthony' then must come to terms with the complex man he's working for and how and if he's going to get back in the game.This is a good-looking film with Pacino sucking out all the air in the room, overpowering both McConaughey and Russo with his take no prisoners acting. McConaughey is one hot number, and there was a time, when he first started acting, that he wanted to be another Paul Newman. Then he was pulled into chick flicks. The result is a successful career but not necessarily a successful acting career. Therefore he's not really a good match for Pacino.Jeremy Piven plays another analyst who works for Abrams, and he does an effective job, as does Armand Assante, a bettor who doesn't like to lose - he's really excellent in a short role.But Pacino rules - you can sense this man's volatility and you have no idea what he's going to pull next. This is definitely a film for Pacino fans. It's not terribly original, but there are some good scenes and some witty dialogue.",6,2,2,12 March 2013
42," truly excellent
","The story of Jackie Robinson stands as an inspiration to anyone who knows about him. In reading about this man, it was said that he wasn't the best African American player and there was another player, much better, who should have been the first to break the color barrier in baseball. But Robinson's story is about so much more than baseball. I don't know anything about the person mentioned, and I'm sure he was an excellent player. But someone has to go first, and in this case, it was a young man who was able to withstand everything that was thrown at him - literally.There were some surprises for me in the movie, one of which was Harrison Ford. Ford is what I call an old-fashioned movie star. Unlike someone like Johnny Depp or Meryl Streep who change their looks and voices and immerse themselves in a character, Ford is more like Gable or one of the Golden Era stars: He's a solid leading man, he does drama and comedy, and projects a strong image. This was all blown out of the water. As Branch Rickey, the man who introduced Robinson to baseball, he moves into another league as an actor as he inhabits Rickey in stance and voice and attitude.The other surprises were more shocks - it's hard to grasp that a soldier who refused to move to the back of the bus would have been court-martialed. It's truly disgusting. And how he could play ball with players who were trying to injure him, people screaming at him from the stands, I have no idea.Chadwick Boseman was fantastic as Jackie - you could see Jackie's thought process on his face as he struggled with his emotions. He portrays a gentle demeanor, though Robinson had a spine of steel and wasn't afraid to speak up. Boseman had good chemistry with the lovely Nicole Beharie, who played Jackie's wife. Chris Meloni captured the spirit of Leo Durocher perfectly; Andre Holland, Lucas Black, Alan Tudyk, T.R. Knight were all terrific.Robinson died from diabetes and heart complications at 53, shortly after the death of his oldest son, who died in a car accident at 25 and had a long struggle with drugs after serving in Vietnam.In my opinion, Robinson was the right man for the job at hand. He is one of our great heroes. He might have not been able to withstand the pressure and dropped out, but he kept fighting and winning.",8,1,2,8 June 2014
Argo," excellent film directed by Ben Affleck
","For all of us to remember the Iran hostage crisis, the Shah's surgery, Nightline, Carter, and the disturbing nightly news views of the hostages, 'Argo' is a revisit of these events and a lesser known true story.The embassy staff are taken hostages, but six of them escape and go to the home of the Canadian ambassador (Victor Garber). The U.S. government tries to figure out a way of getting them out of Iran, and a CIA specialist, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is brought in to consult.After exploring their limited options, Mendez finally suggests the cover story of making a science fiction film, having the escapees be Canadian filmmakers looking for foreign locations. One important element: It has to be a real script, with a real producer and director, publicity, an office, everything. When the option is brought up to the escapees, they're not enthusiastic.The Hollywood sector, played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin, supply the humor, and they're hilarious. On the Iranian side, we have suspense and tension as Mendez and the escapees posing as a Hollywood crew carry out the plan. The question is, can they get on a plane and out of the country? Affleck keeps the tension going and the ending is sheer edge-of-your-seat.I don't understand how this film can be nominated for a Best Film Oscar and the director ignored. Is it the best film of the year? I don't know, I haven't seen them all. I would guess that artistically speaking, it's not as good as Lincoln. But for a story that keeps you hooked, Argo is hard to beat with its easy blend of humor, drama, warmth, and suspense.",8,4,7,20 February 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," savvy?
","2003's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl boasts a large British cast, consisting of Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightly, Jack Davenport, Orlando Bloom, and Jonathan Price. Impressive. Their acting is good. But you could have put a bunch of unknowns in this film along with Johnny Depp and the film would still have been a hit.Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, who goes along with blacksmith Will Turner (Bloom) as he tries to find Elizabeth Swann, his love (Knightley). She is the daughter of the governor and has been kidnapped by the awful Captain Barbossa (Rush). Barbossa and his crew live under an old curse. They're not dead but they're not alive either. The curse can't be broken without returning all of the gold with each pirate's blood back into the chest.Because of the medallion Elizabeth wears, Barbossa believes she is the one he wants. If he gets her medallion and puts her blood on it, the curse will be broken. He's in for a shock.There are some great special effects, suspense, and humor in this overly long film, as well as some wonderful acting, but Johnny Depp steals the film. His hilarious Jack Sparrow, based on Keith Richard, is fantastic. He makes this a film a cut above the usual adventure film by giving such a quirky performance. As he would say, savvy?",8,0,2,20 August 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," I like my my men like I like my eggs - Benedict
","Up front, I have to admit a few things. The last Star Trek film I saw was with the original TV cast. I have never seen The Next Generation. I went to see this film because I love Benedict Cumberbatch. I wasn't disappointed.I think J.J. Abrams was trying to have something for everyone in 'Star Trek Into Darkness' - reminders of the TV show (which of course I have seen) and remnants of the very popular movie Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (which I also saw).I'm not speaking as a die-hard Trekkie. I was glad I saw this in the theater, as the effects were awesome. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and the rest of the Star Trek crew were excellent in their roles, and Benedict Cumberbatch was an exquisite villain.Everyone is complaining about Alice Eve's underwear shot. I say give equal time - Benedict had a shower scene that was cut. Also, if her father was played by Peter Weller and he's supposed to be American, why didn't she have an American accent? I can't nitpick like others can. If you're disappointed, I'm sorry, and if I were more familiar with the Star Trek canon, maybe I would be as well. But for pure entertainment, it was excellent.",8,2,7,24 May 2013
The Other Boleyn Girl," excellent drama
","Put it this way, if you saw Anne of the Thousand Days, you probably felt sorry for Anne Boleyn. After seeing this film, while you might feel sorry for her - not so much.The Other Boleyn Girl is a 2008 film starring Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johannson, Eric Bana, Kristen Scott-Thomas, Mark Rylance, David Morrissey, and Benedict Cumberbatch who at this writing is #2 on the IMDb Starmeter, so I'd say his fortunes have changed.The story fills in what we don't actually know about the Boleyns and tells some of their story, though the writers had to leave a great deal out. Nevertheless, this is a great drama, beautifully costumed and filmed, with wonderful acting and, let's face it, two of the most stunning women in films today.Natalie Portman plays Anne Boleyn, who is more or less pimped out by her father (Mark Rylance) hoping that she can give Henry VIII a son and, in so doing, increase the family's fortunes. It doesn't work out; instead, the King takes a fancy to the newly married Mary, Anne's sister, and both the young women are given a position at court. Henry, then married to Catherine of Aragon, then takes Mary as a lover. Mary later gives birth to a son.Anne secretly marries someone who is betrothed to another, and as a punishment is sent to the court in France. When she returns, she captivates King Henry by refusing to become his mistress while he is still married, driving him to distraction. He eventually gets the law changed so he can divorce Catherine and marry Anne. By now he is long finished with Mary, barely acknowledging his son.One of the created scenes in the film occurs when Anne miscarries her child, a boy. She is desperate that Henry not find out and appeals to her brother to sleep with her. He can't do it. In truth, one of the crimes Anne was charged with was incest, but these allegations were made up. Her brother George was executed because of it, however. In the film, someone sees them together and reports it.I actually think the writers did an okay job with this story - in historical films one always has to combine events and characters or leave them out.Natalie Portman is excellent as Anne, rather bratty, seductive, and emotional. Johannson has a less showy role but she's marvelous as well. Eric Bana is an attractive Henry. The real Henry was a redhead, but the depiction of Henry as slender and attractive is certainly correct for the period in which the story takes place.The film makes a great deal out of the relationship between Anne and Mary -- Anne is furious when Mary nabs the King, then Mary is furious when Anne makes her big move. In fact, the two sisters weren't particularly close. And though in the film Anne is the older sister, historians today believe that Mary was the older one.Mary actually had two children, but there isn't a lot of evidence to support that her second child was actually King Henry's. What isn't mentioned in the film itself is that after Mary's husband (Cumberbatch) died, she married a soldier secretly, a man way beneath her station, and was banished from court, never to return. Her family also disowned her. Up until then, she was at court; when she was widowed, Anne arranged for her to have a pension and had Mary's second child, a boy, educated.After Mary's and Anne's parents died, Mary inherited some property and she and her husband lived quietly and happily for the rest of their lives.Very good film, well worth seeing.",8,0,0,12 December 2012
Coffee and Cigarettes," Jim Jarmusch directs a series of vignettes
","I run hot and cold with Jim Jarmusch. His 'Stranger than Paradise' is a fantastic movie - he has a quirky sense of humor that I love, and also much of 'Mystery Train' is wonderful. I liked some of 'Coffee and Cigarettes' and some I just didn't.This is a series of vignettes revolving around - well, coffee and cigarettes. My favorite was 'Twins' which, besides being a funny segment, has a hilarious performance by Steve Buscemi. 'Those Things'll Kill Ya' is also amusing, though it goes on a little long. 'Strange to Meet You' stars Robert Begnini and was the first of these vignettes, filmed in 1986, and it's fun - strange, but fun.'Cousins' stars the chameleon Cate Blanchett as a well-known personality who visits with her not famous and jealous cousin, also played by Cate Blanchett. This was an interesting personality study of both women, the famous one very sweet and shy, and the not famous one more out there and vocal. It's a real tour de force.Jarmusch really goes back to his student film roots here, with the black and white, simple, low class sets, and his subtle humor. For me some of the vignettes just seemed to have no point, but I think that was the point. Life discussed or happening over coffee and cigarettes can sometimes be crazy, absurd, fun -- or just ordinary.There were several posters here who claim not to know Jarmusch's work. I highly recommend both Stranger than Paradise and Mystery Train.",6,0,1,15 April 2012
Knives Out," fun Agatha Christie-type whodunit
","Daniel Craig does his best imitation of Foghorn Leghorn as a detective in 'Knives Out,' from 2020. Craig plays Benoit Blanc, brought it by an anonymous client to investigate the death of author-millionaire Harlan Thrombey. It's been called a suicide, but slitting one's throat is an odd way of ending your life.Blanc finds himself dealing with the dysfunctional family; Harlan's daughter (Curtis), her husband (Johnson), Greatnana Wanetta (K Callan), and assorted other Thrombeys, plus Harlan's assistant (de Armas).When Harlan's will is read, all hell breaks loose.There's not too much more to say - you'll have to see this delightful Agatha Christie-like confection through to the twists and final end. Very enjoyable.",8,1,5,27 January 2020
The Secret in Their Eyes," A man faces two situations that need closure
","Someone on this board stated that he is normally a harsh critic of Argentinian films. I give him credit because I wouldn't know an Argentinian movie if the movie reel hit me in the face. I wish I were that discerning.'The Secret in Their Eyes' is indeed an Argentinian movie, and an intriguing and dramatic one.In 1999, a retired federal justice, Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin) decides to write a novel. Over the years, he has never forgotten the horrific rape and murder of Liliana Coloto, and the complete devastation of her husband Ricardo Morales. He does a rough draft and brings it to an ex-coworker, Irene Menendez Hastings (Soledad Villamil) for her opinion. She, along with Benjamin and his assistant Pablo Sandoval were all affected by the case.Back then, some 25 years earlier, Benjamin sees a photograph of Liliana with some schoolmates, and zeroes in on one man, Isidoro Gomez (Javier Godino) whom he sees looking at Liliana in the picture. 'Something in his eyes,' he says -- and it's something he recognizes, having been in love with Irene all these years. Gomez was ultimately caught, released, and vanished. The case was closed.Benjamin revisits the case now, reminiscing with Irene, who has continued with the Justice Department. The end of the case has always bothered him, but he can't put his finger on WHY. Though he can fictionalize his novel, he won't be happy until he really closes this case.Dark, mysterious, violent, with a shocking ending, 'The Secret in Their Eyes' is a marvelous, absorbing film, filled with atmosphere as Benjamin attempts to resolve his life and Liliana's tragic murder. Beautifully directed by Juan Jose Campanella, this in many ways is a difficult story -- difficult because it's not filled with special effects and excitement, but flashbacks and characters. Ricardo Darin as Benjamin Esposito is terrific - warm, likable, and emotional as a man seeking the truth of the case and the truth of himself. All of the acting is strong.Passion matters in this film; you can change many things about a man, Pablo Sandoval says, but you cannot change his passion. Passion, no matter how many years pass, is the key.",9,2,3,25 August 2014
The Irishman," brilliant film with a gimmick not ready for prime time
","I won't go through the plot. I will say it was a joy to see Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino. Joe Pesci, Bobby Cannavale and others in 'The Irishman.' There are many reasons to praise Scorsese's work but I think for a film to last nearly 3-1/2 hours and move so quickly is amazing and a tribute to his artistry.The acting is superb. The three stars manage to create characters that are completely fleshed out. In many ways it's a sad story, with DeNiro's character, Sheeran's, last scenes heartbreaking.In actuality, according to a Hoffa expert of 40 years. the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa didn't quite go down as portrayed. Like 'JFK' the source is one person, and there are conflicting stories. Nevertheless it's compelling.Now I'll go into why I gave this film a 9. I'm sorry and I don't care what anyone else thinks, CGI isn't there yet. Both DeNiro and Pacino looked as if they had scoliosis and no necks, wearing clothes too big for them. I found it very distracting. In one of the first scenes, DeNiro is a young man driving a truck. I didn't recognize him. Too gimmicky. The aging - and I think they made these guys look older than they are - was much better than the deaging.If it didn't take away from anyone's experiences, I'm glad. You can do so much with actual makeup and lighting -- it was at least worth a try.",9,2,6,29 November 2019
Black Book," WW II film
","Paul Verhoeven co-wrote and directed this tremendous undertaking, Black Book (Zwartboek), a Dutch film from 2006. This is a big, sprawling film about World War II and the travails of a Jewish woman, Rachel Stein.The film starts on a kibbutz in Israel, where Rachel (Carice van Houten) is living and teaching, when she runs into a tourist (Halina Reijn) who knew her during the war. Rachel thinks back to those days, when she was hiding with a Christian family until their house was bombed. She then meets someone from the Resistance who helps her get a boat into free territory. Tragedy strikes.Rachel begins to work with the Resistance who have her dye her hair and give her fake I.D. as Ellis deVries. While on a train, she meets a German officer, Muntze (Sebastian Koch). He seems interested in her, so the Resistance asks her to go undercover.A very suspenseful and scary film that makes the point that not only can't you trust everyone, but that not everyone was out to help the greater good - sometimes only themselves. And within the Nazi regime, there were real baddies and some not so bad. An interesting take.The film is carried by Carice van Houten, an absolutely beautiful woman who is one heck of an actress. I frankly preferred her with her natural dark hair; with her blond hair, she bore a resemblance to Annie Potts, which I found disconcerting. Nevertheless, she was pretty fantastic in a real workhorse role.The rest of the cast was very effective. Extremely absorbing film that, despite its length, will keep you watching.",8,0,1,12 September 2013
Pirate Radio," Lots of fun if all over the place
","'The Boat that Rocked' or 'Pirate Radio' is a 2009 film about a time in the U.K. where rock music was not allowed to be played on the BBC. This gave rise to a widely listened to pirate radio station that broadcast from a ship inhabited by some dedicated deejays and technicians.The film stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Sturridge, Rhys Ifans, January Jones, Emma Thompson, Chris O'Dowd, Nick Frost, and Ralph Brown, and is directed with a fairly loose hand by Richard Curtis.The result is a fun movie with a terrific '60s soundtrack. The characters are wild: There's Quentin (Nighy), the ship's captain, an American called The Count (Hoffman), Gavin, the star DJ (Ifans), Felicity, the lesbian cook (Katherine Parkinson), Simon (O'Dowd), the dawn treading DJ, Bob, whom no one meets until he's been on the ship for 7 months, Dr. Dave (Frost), and Carl (Sturridge), Quentin's godson, who has been sent to live there after being expelled from school. They party hard and broadcast harder, and young Carl has his first experience with women and also makes it through a visit by his mother (Thompson). Meanwhile, on dry land, the policymakers (led by Branagh) are determined to make a law to close down pirate radio.There are several subplots in the film, one including Mad Men's January Jones as a bride, and Carl's search for his father. The film is a little all over the place and disorganized, but that may have been intentional to portray the atmosphere of the ship and characters.Baby boomers like myself should love it, as well as younger audiences. Because of the music and the audience on land listening to it, 'Pirate Radio' has the unmistakable ambiance of youth.",8,2,4,20 March 2010
The Great Dictator," Amazing film, amazing Chaplin
","Charlie Chaplin is 'The Great Dictator' in this 1940 comedy-drama also starring Paulette Goddard, Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell and Billy Gilbert. Chaplin has the dual role of a Hitler-like dictator, Adenoid Hynkel ('Hail, Hynkel') (all the countries are fictional, and the party logo is one X on top of another) and also a war veteran, a sweet barber who looks like Hynkel. There are some truly hilarious parts of this film as well as some truly dramatic ones. The barber trying to keep from falling out of a plane is just one; the nonsense German Hynkel speaks; the barber shaving one customer in time with the music, playing to Chaplin's silent film strengths; Hynkel's dancing with his world globe, which is really a huge balloon.The serious parts take place in the Jewish ghetto where the Jews are persecuted by Hynkel's men - Jew is written on the store fronts, and the soldiers are violent. In such stark contrast to the comedy, these scenes make a strong impression. The ghetto never knows what to expect - when Hynkel is trying to get a loan from a man named Epstein to attack and take over Osterlich, he has his soldiers lay off the Jews so as not to upset Epstein. Eventually the barber winds up in a concentration camp but escapes and is mistaken for Hynkel.Under Chaplin's direction, none of the film seems to be played for comedy. Hynkel himself is a buffoon, but he means it. The most amazing part of the film for me was the very end, when the Barber gives a speech as Hynkel. It's absolutely brilliant and very timely. The beautiful, radiant Goddard, looking at the sky, hope in her eyes, is not something I'll ever forget.Highly recommended. Made in 1940, the U.S. had not entered the war and Europe's problems were just beginning. Alas, the barber's speech wasn't reality.",8,3,5,12 February 2008
Dead Poets Society," Robin Williams tells students to 'seize the day'
","Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Norman Lloyd, and Alexandra Powers star in 'Dead Poets Society,' a 1989 film directed by Peter Weir and written by Tom Schulman.William plays an English teacher, John Keating, who comes back to his alma mater, an exclusive boys school, to teach. His teaching technique is very different from anyone else's. His focus is on encouraging students to find themselves by reading and writing poetry, to be individuals, and to know their own hearts, to see the world in a unique way, and to take risks - 'carpe diem.' One of the students finds Keating's old yearbook and learns he was part of something called The Dead Poets Society.When he's asked about it, Keating says that he and some of his fellow students met in a cave and read poetry. Neil (Leonard) and his friends Todd (Hawke), Knox (Josh Charles), Gale (Charlie Dalton) and others form the club again, find the cave, and sneak out at night. They read, laugh, and joke.The boys are inspired by Keating and, in their own lives, try to break out. Each has his own story but the main focus is Neil, whose dictatorial father is insisting that he become a doctor when in his heart, he wants to be an actor.Unfortunately, the school doesn't exactly want students to think for themselves and neither do their parents. Problems arise due to Keating's unorthodox teaching methods and opening these kids' minds.What a beautiful movie and what great imagery of birds flying free, the boys standing on their school desks and seeing the room from a different perspective, that idea of being 'up high' used when Neil late at night looks out the window of his home.The film is predictable, but that doesn't make it any less powerful. It's set in 1959, and yes, kids did what their parents told them to do, and if your parents didn't like your choice of career, you were discouraged from going into it. I know someone who wanted to have a career in the army; his parents flew to Germany to see him. The young man returned, became an attorney, and was never a good one, nor a very happy person. Someone else I know actually got a part on Broadway and her parents made her return to her home town. Yes, that kind of thing happened. If you're creative like Neil, you can't really suppress it - the soul cries out for something else.Robert Sean Leonard, Wilson on 'House' is very young here. He gives a marvelous performance. I've seen him on Broadway twice - he's a very serious and committed actor. Everyone is good in this well-cast film. Robin Williams absolutely shines as a warm, funny man who loves to teach and who believes teaching goes way beyond just the subject. He's just fantastic.For me, anyway, there weren't a lot of surprises in this film, but I loved it. It was both uplifting and depressing - the school wants the students to meet the status quo, and Keating wanted them to fly. Today, it's still not easy being different.",8,2,2,8 January 2013
Home Alone," Fun Christmas film
","A little boy ends up 'Home Alone' when his family leaves for Paris without him in this 1990 film starring Macauley Culkin, Catherine O'Hara, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The family is running late and nearly misses a flight to Paris; a neighbor boy gets into their van, so when the oldest girl does a head count, all are accounted for. Except that little Kevin (Culkin), who was sent to bed early and wishes his family would disappear, isn't there. It's not until they're on the plane that his mother (O'Hara) realizes that Kevin is missing. While she attempts to get back to him, Kevin needs to fend for himself and also protect himself from two robbers (Pesci and Stern) who are systematically robbing the neighbors and have Kevin's house targeted.Very funny, often laugh out loud film with Culkin pulling all kinds of pranks to keep the criminals out, from making it look like he's not alone by queuing up video tapes of crime films and setting booby traps should they break in. He also takes the time to talk to a mysterious neighbor (Roberts Blossom) who is estranged from his son. Mom, meanwhile, ends up in a movers truck with John Candy.Culkin is adorable without being cloying, and the movie has a wonderful warmth about it as well. Not the type of thing I'd normally enjoy, but I sure enjoyed this one.",8,0,0,27 December 2009
About Time," one of the loveliest films I have ever seen
","'About Time' from 2013 is a beautiful story, beautifully told.A young man, Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) learns from his father that he can travel in time; it's a gift shared by all the men in the family and kept secret from anyone else. All he has to do is find a dark place, clench his fists, and decide what he wants to relive.He can't alter history, but he can redo certain incidents so he does better. The one thing he wants is a girlfriend. Moving from Cornwall to London to work as an attorney, he meets the pretty, sweet Mary (Rachel McAdams) and, after a do-over, develops a relationship with her, and they begin to build a life together.Though his gift comes in handy, saving his playwright friend from an opening night horror, his wedding from awful best man speeches, and helping his sister (this took a couple of time hops), Tim finds that his gift can't keep him from life's inevitable sorrows. I'm tempted to say this was a lovely movie where nothing happens, except that life happens, in all its happiness, and poignancy and bittersweet moments. It's the kind of movie that can make a man cry, the emotions are so real.I've never been a huge fan of Bill Nighy's, who plays Tim's father - I have seen in dozens of films. He is wonderful here, as a funny, loving father. Lindsay Duncan, a fantastic actress -- I saw her on Broadway in 'Private Lives,' is great as Tim's mother.Rachel McAdams always reminds of Jennifer Garner, which is a compliment to Garner since she's a bit older. McAdams has a sweet, gentle presence, and she's delightful in this film.Then we get to the lead, Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, a somewhat gawky young man who projects warmth and humor that really carries this film.The rest of the cast is top-notch: Lydia Wilson, Richard Cordery, Joshua McGuire, and Tom Hollander.A magical film about life's journey, whether you can time travel or not.",10,4,6,24 January 2016
The Hustler," Powerhouse performances about a man who learns the true meanings of winning and losing
","Paul Newman stars as 'The Hustler,' a fantastic film that costars George C. Scott, Piper Laurie, and Jackie Gleason. It's the story of a young man, Eddie (Newman) who makes his living as a pool shark. Then he meets three people who will change his life: Minnesota Fats (Gleason), Bert Gordon (Scott), and Sarah (Laurie). Both Gordon and Sarah see the man that Eddie can be - but they're seeing different things. Which man he will become remains to be seen at the beginning of the film.This is a gritty, black and white movie that takes place in pool halls, cheap hotels, and rooming houses for the most part. The people populating it are drunks, hustlers, parasites, and desperate people. Eddie is a young guy obsessed with winning, money, and taking down Minnesota Fats. Gordon is a gambler who bets on men, staking them with his money and taking their souls in return. Laurie is a lonely, lame alcoholic who falls for Eddie but finds him distant and preoccupied. They all play their parts as he learns what the game of life is all about for real.There's no question that even if he had not made some of the films he did, Paul Newman would have become a tremendous star. He's a magnificent actor, magnetic, and handsome to boot. But he probably owes a couple of his films to the death of James Dean - 'Somebody Up There Likes Me' was definitely one, and more than likely this would have been another. Both men, of course, had the talent and unique sets of qualities to enable them to make a role their own, and Newman plays this complex role beautifully. In some scenes, his character will not permit any emotion to show, but toward the end of the film, faced with a tragedy, his whole body gives way as if someone has just hit him in the stomach with a boulder. The great thing about Newman is, despite his tremendous fame, you always forget it's Newman and become involved with the part he's playing. 25 years later, this role would win him the Oscar he should have received the first time around. Well, better late than never.George C. Scott is great as Gordon. In the case of Gordon, he has a put-on persona - but when the real Gordon comes through, it's scary. Your heart goes out to Laurie's character through her touching and very strong performance as a pathetic woman whose life is isolated and stuck in a bottle.Each actor in the film has a difficult role to play, as there are no one-dimensional characters, and each actor cast has amazing ability. Probably few actors or performers ever had the ability of Jackie Gleason. As Minnesota Fats, he projects a rock-solid persona that takes over the screen - and he does it with precious little to say. The expression on his face, the way he sits, tell you everything you need to know.Stunningly directed by Robert Rossen, 'The Hustler' is a no-miss but only if you want to see great acting and a compelling story.",8,3,4,25 March 2006
Spotlight," heavy story well-handled
","Having lived in Boston, and having been raised Catholic, there were many elements of 'Spotlight' that were impressive. The story concerns the Boston Globe's 2001 investigation into sexual abuse of minors committed by priests, and how the Catholic church covered up the crimes by moving the priests from parish to parish.The reporters are members of the Spotlight team, which work on important, investigative stories. They are are Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). Their boss is Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton), and his boss is the new guy in town, editor Martin 'Marty' Baron (Leiv Schreiber). Above all of them is Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery).For many years prior to the sexual abuse scandal, Spotlight had investigated and reported on many other ground-breaking stories.When an attorney, Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) claims that the Archbishop of Boston knew that Father John Geoghan, a priest in the diocese was sexually abusing children, the bishop did nothing.Baron wants the Spotlight reporters to find out whether it's true, whether if it's an isolated incident, or if it is a common practice. When 9/11 hits, they have to put the story on hold, but pick it up again.Fascinating story, and we see the investigation grow from the beginning, from trying to interview victims, then priests, getting sealed documents from court, and the shock of learning how widespread the problem is. The film also focuses on the pressure and lack of cooperation from outside sources, the reverence with which people hold the Church, and the tremendous influence and hold that it has on the city. When one boy was abused, the Cardinal visited his home to calm the waters, and 'my mother served freakin' cookies.' For someone in my mother's generation, it is a devastating story.Seeing the Boston locations was amazing -- including exactly where I once worked in Government Center. The acting, including the accents, was excellent, but nothing overwhelmed the story. The emphasis seemed to be on ensemble performance and keeping the story up front.'Spotlight' tells a sobering, sad tale. As one of the sources says, 'The church is an institution of men, and even well-meaning men fail.' One questions how well-meaning men were who decided to keep this quiet. And the point is made in the film that spirituality and faith are separate from formalized religion.",8,0,0,23 March 2016
Insomnia," Al Pacino battles Robin Williams and no sleep
","Sumptuous scenery and a fresh, enthusiastic Hillary Swank are in sharp contrast to weary Al Pacino in 'Insomnia,' about a legendary LA homicide investigator who goes to Alaska to assist in finding a killer. In the land of the midnight sun, Pacino finds there's no rest from his demons.This is a slow-moving film at times, though the performances are very good. Pacino makes one tired just to look at him. As the film goes on, and he's had no sleep due to the constant light, his voice becomes raspy, his eyes are nearly shut, and he looks stupefied. He plays a complicated man, hounded by a departmental investigation and now a blackmailing killer. Like many of his other characterizations, Pacino gives us many layers of an imperfect man. Hillary Swank is very good, though wasted in a role that doesn't give her much to do except be young. Robin Williams, as a mystery author, turns in an excellent performance. Former General Hospital actor Jonathan Jackson has a small part as the victim's boyfriend. Jackson is very much a chameleon, playing a bad boy as if he was born to it.This was probably a disappointment in a movie theater at $10 a shot; it's perhaps more interesting as a rental or on television.",7,0,1,25 August 2005
L.A. Confidential," The cast of a lifetime in a 1997 noir set in LA of the '50s
","One of the greatest films ever made, L.A. Confidential benefits from a great script (Brian Helgeland), great performances (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, David Straithairn), and great direction (Curtis Hanson). It's not easy to do a film noir in modern times that is set it in the past. All too often, the performances are too stylized or nonorganic, the direction is stilted -- the whole thing comes off as an attempt, and not a very good one. In this case, though, the result is brilliant.Basically, L.A. Confidential is the story of three very different kinds of police officers who become involved in the same case, the Night Owl Murders. There's Russell Crowe as Bud White, the loose cannon, a strong but vulnerable cop; Guy Pearce as Exley, the political, honest, by the book cop who incurs everyone's wrath; and Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes, the celebrity detective who is a consultant on a Dragnet-type TV show, Badge of Honor. He works hand in hand with a writer for Hush magazine (Danny DeVito). But they're not the only ones embroiled in the Night Owl diner slaughter. There's Dudley Smith (James Cromwell), the Chief of Police, Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin), the bisexual D.A., the wealthy, powerful Pierce Patchett (David Straithairn); and Lynn, the Veronica Lake-lookalike call girl (Kim Basinger). And Rollo Tomassi, of course - an important name in the investigation.It's hard to single out any one performance. The film is perfectly cast. The three officers - Spacey, Crowe, and Pearce - are as brilliant as the characters they play are different. And everyone else in the cast is fantastic as well.Historically, there are some things that are not correct as far as Hollywood - The Bad and the Beautiful and Roman Holiday did not run at the same time; and the duo of Johnny Stompanato and Lana Turner came later. However, two elements of the film are based on reality or at least rumors - there was supposedly a call girl ring where the women looked like famous film stars; and 'Hush' magazine, the cover anyway, looks like 'Whisper' magazine from that era.L.A. Confidential is a story of twists, turns, and camaraderie that take place on the mean streets of '50s L.A., a story that winds up changing the lives of everyone involved. Filled with atmosphere and suspense, it's a not to be missed, violent, vivid portrait of a time when things at LAPD were (and still might be today) off the record, on the q.t. -- and very hush-hush.",10,2,3,29 May 2010
Concussion," Head-butting
","Will Smith, Alec Baldwin, and Arthur Brooks star in 'Concussion' from 2015. Smith plays Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian working in Pittsburgh as a coroner, who was the first to publish on the effect of multiple head injuries in football players, with players developing dementia, committing suicide, and using drugs. His boss is Dr. Cyril Wecht (Brooks).Of course I read the comments from the obvious deniers but also supportive ones from some football players. First of all, it makes sense that multiple head injuries would lead to some kind of problem. Hello. Natasha Richardson was wearing a helmet, fell while skiing, and became brain dead. That was just one hit in the head.The NFL didn't see it that way, satisfied I guess with throwing dogs down elevator shafts and coming to the conclusion that football wasn't dangerous. Omalu financed the testing on the brain of football player Mike Webster, who wound up homeless and demented, and saw the syndrome, which he named CTE - chronic traumatic encephalopathy So Dr. Omalu was in a peck of trouble, particularly in a football town like Pittsburgh. He published his findings in 2002; the NFL never even acknowledged there was a connection between CTE and football until 2009. When they couldn't convince Omalu to retract his findings, Roger Goodell set up a commission but Omalu was not allowed in the room; instead, his findings were presented by a former NFL doctor (Baldwin) who is helping him. It was all a big set-up so they could act like they cared. They didn't. They do now but just barely.I found this an excellent film with a wonderful performance by Will Smith. It was based on the eponymous book, which arose out of an article in GQ about what Omalu ran into with the NFL. The film takes certain dramatic licensing so some of the incidents or their timing is not accurate, but the general story is.The film demonstrates, as if we didn't know, that the NFL considers itself God and uses its influence in all sorts of ways, some I'm sure good, and others not so good. Many years ago I was involved in a discussion with a group that wanted to present an award at a Superbowl, maybe a 30-second thing. Basically they were told the NFL didn't have to do anything for them and why would they. After all, isn't the almighty dollar the only thing anyone in the U.S. cares about? Watching the last scene in this film, I was left disgusted. I hope many parents have gotten the message. Then again, I suppose with the millions of dollars you can make, losing your mind is a small price to pay.",8,1,2,25 October 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Jack's back
","I admit up front, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' isn't my kind of thing. Had it not been of the presence of Johnny Depp, I would never have seen it.Having said that, it's a rousing adventure with lots of action, special effects, and Depp. After Elizabeth, Will, and Captain Barbossa rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from the the land of the dead, they must face Davy Jones and Lord Cutler Beckett. Beckett, now with control of Jones' heart, forms an alliance with Jones so that he can take over the seas and destroy the Pirates. Jack, Will, Elizabeth, Tia Dalma, and crew summon the Pirate Lords from around the world. They want to release the goddess Calypso, Davy Jones's lover, from the trap they put her in; to do that, they have to combine the 9 sovereigns that will set her free so that she can help them fight. Depp and the rest of the cast are terrific - Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jonathan Pryce, etc. Keith Richards, Depp's inspiration for his characterization of Jack Sparrow, makes a brief appearance as Jack's father - he apparently was so drunk he needed to be propped up.Though this is a fabulous-looking movie, I doubt without the Depp characterization of Jack Sparrow that there would have been subsequent Pirates films. He is outrageous and fabulous with brilliant comic timing.",6,0,0,4 October 2009
Match Point," A furtive tear
","As much as I have always appreciated Woody Allen comedies, I admit to liking more the dramas where he asks the tough questions. The brilliant 'Match Point,' like 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' is one of those, and it's his best.Loosely based on 'A Place in the Sun,' Allen's tough question is, 'Would you rather be good or lucky?' 'Is there such a thing as luck?' Many believe that people 'make their own luck.' But Allen's premise is that, when it's all over, luck plays a huge part in all of our lives. He uses the analogy of a tennis ball - when you serve a ball and it lands on the net, it can topple over to the other side, and you win, or fall on the same side, and you lose.What a perfect analogy to tell the story of Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a former professional tennis player. He becomes the tennis teacher at a British club and meets Tom Hewett, a young man from a filthy rich family. Chris is embraced by Hewett's family and begins dating Tom's sister Chloe. Then he sees Tom's fiancé, Nola, played by Scarlett Johannson, and becomes obsessed with her.This is an amazing film - absolutely nothing happens for a while, and yet everything happens. The story is punctuated with old, scratchy Caruso records and operatic selections from 'Macbeth,' 'Otello,' and others. We watch the characters living their lives, including their work, romantic entanglements, and marital problems. We watch them evolve, grow happy or unhappy, contented or restless, all leading up to the point where something does happen. When it does, it's ferocious. The ending will knock your socks off. It goes nowhere you think it's going. The film manages to keep you constantly off-balance and misinterpreting what you think you're seeing.The last time I saw Jonathan Rhys Meyers, he was giving a marvelous portrayal of Elvis Presley, despite the fact that his height and frame are somewhat slighter than the King's. A beautiful young man, he has an interior dialogue going throughout the film. We don't hear it; we see it on his face. Scarlet Johannson is gorgeous and sexy as Nola, a cool blond in the Lana Turner tradition who is the object of his desire. Of all the characters in the film, her character goes through the most change, and she's very effective.There are no easy answers to the questions Allen asks in 'Crimes and Misdemeanors,' 'Stardust Memories,' 'Bullets over Broadway,' and 'Match Point.' Allen leaves open what will happen emotionally as a result of the events of this film. But the verse of 'Una Furtiva Lagrima,' (A secret tear) played several times during the film despite a bad skip in the recording means 'For just one moment the beating Of her hot pulse could be felt! With her sighing confounding Momentarily my sighs! Oh God, I shall expire; I can't ask for more.' Significantly, it is heard at the beginning of the film and at the end.Just remember - the record skips.",10,3,5,19 February 2006
Midnight in Paris," Woody in Paris
","Wow, Woody Allen took on New York City for years, and everyone was shocked when he set his film Match Point in London. Now here is in Paris, the City of Lights, and it looks just as gorgeous as one who has never been there imagines it. And he gives us a story to match.Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams play Gil, a successful Hollywood screenwriter, and his fiancée Inez, an engaged couple who go to Paris with her parents (Mimi Kennedy and Kurt Fuller) before their wedding. Tired of the Hollywood scene Gil is hard at work on his first novel, which is about a man who works in a nostalgia shop. Gil falls in love with Paris and wants to settle there, but Inez has her heart set on Malibu. The time with Inez and her parents soon becomes tedious, in part due to an old professor of Inez's, Paul and his wife, Carol (Michael Sheen and Nina Arianda), whom Gil finds insufferable. Slowly he realizes that Inez and her parents' values are different from his, so he finds himself leaving them to their own activities and going off by himself.One night, he walks home from a restaurant and gets lost. As he's sitting on some steps, an old-fashioned car pulls up and invites him in. He realizes that he's in the company of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, who take him to a party where Cole Porter is playing the piano, and then to a bar, where he meets Ernest Hemingway. Somehow, he is back in Paris of the '20s, though he returns to 2010.The next night, Gil rushes Inez to the spot, but she gets bored and leaves before the clock strikes midnight, at which point, another old car pulls up. Over the various nights, Gil meets Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Alice B. Toklas (who agrees to read his manuscript), Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, Luis Bunuel, Salvador Dali (Adrian Brody), Cole Porter, T. S. Eliot, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse-LaTrec, Degas, sees Josephine Baker perform, and goes to Maxim's. The one who makes the biggest impression is Picasso's lover, Ariadne (Marion Cotillard) with whom he falls in love.Though on the surface a light time-travel film, 'Midnight in Paris' tackles some interesting subjects, not the least of which is discovering who you are and what you want and that it doesn't jive with your companion's. More fascinating, though, is the nostalgia aspect, that other eras always seem more exciting, simpler, and better, and that in the end, the wish to return to another time is just an escape from the angst of the present. To his surprise, he finds that Adriana longs for the Belle-Epoque era, feeling that the '20s are the way that Paul would describe the 2000 millennium thus far. He learns an important lesson.What a wonderful film, with each person looking like the character he or she plays -- Bates is a fabulous Gertrude Stein, Brody is a delightful Dali, and Corey Stoll a convincing Hemingway. Tom Hiddleston looks like photos of Fitzgerald. As the somewhat shallow Inez, Rachel McAdams is perfect - a sexy shop till you drop woman who wants the fairy tale. Wilson seems to copy Woody Allen's line readings at times, and he's just right as a confused young man looking for something but unsure that that is. He only knows something is missing.Allen is very prolific, and sometimes he hits, and sometimes he misses -- but as far as I'm concerned, he doesn't miss very often. His writing and direction of 'Midnight in Paris' are solid, and he has another winner. Even at his age, he continues literally to broaden his horizons -- next he's going to Rome and Copenhagen. Some gifts, it seems, just keep on giving.",9,0,0,19 April 2012
A Bridge Too Far," a good film about a real mess
","A huge international cast stars in 'A Bridge Too Far,' a world war II film based on the Cornelius Ryan novel. It's based on a true incident and has true characters, some of whom gave rise to controversy when the film was released.The stars include Sean Connery, Robert Redford, Anthony Hopkins, Gene Hackman, Ryan O'Neal, Liv Ullmann, Laurence Olivier, Dirk Bogarde, Michael Caine, Edward Fox, Elliot Gould, Jeremy Kemp, and James Caan.The title refers to a remark by Lt. General 'Boy' Browning (Dirk Bogarde) who supposedly said something like, 'I always said we were going a bridge too far.' The film tells the story of operation Market Garden, an attempt by the allies to end the war by securing three bridges in Holland that allowed access over the Rhine into Germany.Unfortunately it was a complete disaster.There were too many contingencies not planned for by the Allies, plus the German presence was much stronger than expected. And the Germans got stronger since they were getting the Allies' supplies - when the parameters changed, no one told the planes, and all the signaling in the world didn't help because the pilots were trained not to pay any attention to ground signals. So the divisions were running out of food and ammunition. Some of them couldn't actually get to the bridges -- all kinds of problems.The scapegoat for all of this in the film is Lt. General Browning for several reasons. One - the characters of Patton, Montgomery and Eisenhower were not featured in the film; the funds for the movie came from the U.S. and Browning, being British, seemed a good bet; and lastly, Browning was dead and couldn't complain.Alas, Browning was well known. He not only served in WW II but worked for Queen Elizabeth, and on top of that, he was married to Daphne du Maurier. She and Browning's children were offended by his portrayal in the film as a cold-hearted general who ignored good Dutch surveillance. His portrayal was the subject of editorials in the British papers and letters to the editor from Richard Attenborough, the director.Dirk Bogarde didn't take kindly to the portrayal he was directed to give by the script and director either and felt completely betrayed by Attenborough, his director and next door neighbor, causing a rift between them that was never completely fixed.In truth, indeed, Browning reported to Montgomery who wanted a big success in Holland and he did ignore good information about panzer divisions in Holland; in fact, the soldier who complained that the surveillance was being ignored was put on sick leave.This all sounds like it was an enormous part of the film, but it wasn't. At the time, though, I think a prejudice against Bogarde being gay also played into the complaints.The film is filled with huge battles and has some very exciting and poignant sequences. Though there are so many divisions and commanders, it's directed well so that it's not hard to follow.A slice of World War II that reminds us again of the terrible loss of civilian and military life and mass destruction. Not a bad idea for memorial day.",7,4,6,31 May 2011
Youth," Youth - it's about aging.
","Youth is a beautifully and thoughtfully made film by Paul Sorrentino - about aging. Caine and Keitel are two old men, best friends, staying in a fancy Swiss hotel for the summer.Fred Ballinger (Caine) is a famous conductor/composer, now retired, and Keitel is a film director, Mick Boyle, who is working on his film while at the hotel, putting the script together with the actors who will appear in it. Ballinger's daughter (Weisz) is her father's assistant, and she is staying with him.An emissary for Queen Elizabeth visits Ballinger to ask him to conduct his own composition, Simple Songs, for Prince Philip's birthday. He refuses. That portion is based on a situation with Ricardo Muti, who could not agree with the Queen on repertoire and ultimately refused to conduct a concert.Michael Caine gives a great performance as a man who feels his life is over. He comes off as being much more fragile than we usually see him, even at his age. He has some very funny dialogue. Harvey Keitel is wonderful as a man going forward, feeding off the energy of the young actors with whom he is working. Rachel Weisz as Lena is heartfelt as a woman who has both anger and love for her father. I saw her on stage -
she's so stunning it's ridiculous.The scenery and the music are flawless.I can't say much more about this film - you either get it or you don't. It's about aging, how you choose to deal with it, love, looking back, looking forward, memories, and one other big thing - youth.",8,1,2,9 July 2019
Milk," Human, not just gay, rights
","Sean Penn is 'Milk' - Harvey Milk, that is - in this 2008 film directed by Gus van Sant and also starring James Franco, Josh Brolin, Victor Garber, and Alison Pill. The film takes through Milk's life from the time he hit 40 and 'hadn't done anything' until his assassination in 1978 at the hands of his angry ex-colleague, Dan White (Brolin) in 1978. Mayor George Moscone was also killed by White the same day. The trial became famous for the 'Twinkie defense' when White's attorneys claimed he was chemically imbalanced because of eating a lot of junk food. He only served five years in prison, but two years after being released, he killed himself.Harvey Milk's story is a remarkable and inspiring one, and van Sant gives it full breadth here - Milk's commitment and passion to the cause of gay/human rights, his determination despite losing three elections, his quick mind, and his boundless energy. Despite a wave of hate against gays moving across the country, he helped to convince California voters to defeat Proposition 6, which would have allowed the firing of gay teachers and school workers.The story remains timely in its reminder of the progress of gay rights and also its challenges, which are the same as they were then, the opposition of fundamentalist Christians.I was around during this period in history. I well remember Anita Bryant and Dade County, but I admit to not having much idea of what was going on in the rest of the country. It was an eye-opener for someone who went to music school, pursued a theater career in New York and had many gay friends, some of whom were 'in the closet.' Milk invited everyone out of the closet so that people would realize that gays made up their neighbors, their teachers, their doctors, their friends, etc. He felt it was important to be who you are and to set an example so that young people wouldn't hate themselves for being different and would be unafraid of their true identity.The performances are brilliant all the way down the line. I have said for some time that while I love Johnny Depp, I consider Sean Penn the greatest actor in films. He doesn't portray Milk, he inhabits the man. He's likable, sympathetic, courageous, funny, warm, smart, and energetic as Milk himself must have been to inspire so many people. It's a tour de force. James Franco, in another chameleon performance, is a standout as Harvey's boyfriend Scott.Truly a great film, a great script, an interesting slice of history, a searing performance by Penn. A must see.",9,0,3,12 June 2009
The Prestige," Obsession is a young man's game
","Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson star in 'The Prestige' a 2006 film directed by Christopher Nolan.Jackman and Bale play Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, magicians in turn of the century London. The story is told in flashback until close to the end of the film. Angier and Borden start out as friends and colleagues, working as a magician's assistant. Tragedy strikes, and they become mortal enemies. Each becomes famous as a magician, and when Borden performs the ultimate illusion, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to find out how he did it and becomes determined to top it.This is an excellent film that will have you with your jaw on the ground at the end. In my own case I had to go back and re-watch the ending. This isn't a movie you can watch and zone out - the plot requires active following, as Nolan switches points of view between Angier and Borden, and skips from the past to the present. However, he does it with a master's skill. The other interesting thing about the film is the bad guy/good guy concept, which he turns upside down and inside out.'The Prestige' captures the atmosphere of 19th century London perfectly. All of the actors - and the casting is superb - are in top form, with Caine giving an steady performance as the old magician who tries to keep Angier grounded and David Bowie as the mysterious Nikola Tesla. Jackman and Bale are well-matched as adversaries - both volatile and ambitious, driven men.Like a magician, Nolan distracts the viewer with one thing and then pulls a rabbit out of the hat. Sheer brilliance.You'll want to see this movie again. Highly recommended.",9,3,6,14 March 2010
Once," Sweet
","'Once' is the story of two people brought together by music. The question is, due to circumstances, can they ever be together? This is almost an 'Umbrellas of Cherbourg' type film as it is told mainly in song by well-known Irish musician Glen Hansard and Marketa Iglova, a real-life couple. Due to the unaffectedness, attractiveness and chemistry of the two stars, the story emerges in a very sweet and natural way.For the generation to whom this film is geared, it's absolutely wonderful. It's pure and sincere and very poignant. I admit that for me, it's not my type of music, though I did like the Oscar- winning song and appreciated that the movie was made on a shoestring and done so successfully. I really applaud the filmmaker.This is a movie that means a lot to people and has found a niche all its own. It's great when a small film can do that. Sadly, the Hollywood studios never seem to take notice.",7,3,4,29 April 2008
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," I could follow it anyway
","I will say upfront I'm a mystery-suspense-spy fanatic. If a film has any of those elements, I've seen it.'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' is a story that has been around a long time, but one that has escaped me. When I tried to read the book, I couldn't understand what the heck they were talking about and had to stop. I may have tried to watch the Alec Guiness version, but I'm vague on it. I have a feeling I just couldn't follow it.So I approached this film version with some trepidation. I was pleasantly surprised. It's actually a very straightforward story, if underplayed, about Smiley (Gary Oldman) and his search for a mole inside the 'circus,' the top echelon of the British Intelligence Service.And what a cast - Colin Firth, Cirian Hinds, John Hurt, Benedict Cumberbatch (who seems to be everywhere except where I want him to be, in front of a camera filming another season of Sherlock Holmes), and Tom Hardy.The film is set in the 1970s, and locations include Budapest, Paris, and Istanbul.Though I believe this film could have used better editing - it slips in and out of the past and present very awkwardly, which makes it confusing - I liked it. It's very British in that it moves slowly but it still manages to be absorbing.'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' isn't your typical spy movie. It's not James Bond, it's not Jason Bourne. You won't be breathless from the excitement or special effects. But if you want a good story and good acting, you'll enjoy it.",7,1,4,26 March 2012
"I, Tonya"," A re-telling of events of 1994 with a slightly different perspective
","I had mixed feelings while watching this excellent film and the great performances by Margot Robbie and Allison Janney.I followed every second of this scandal when it broke 25 years ago. I felt as many did that if Tonya couldn't find an ice show that would let her skate to Goodfellas, she might as well quit. She definitely knew what was going on, as she admitted in a recent interview.This film attempts to put her in a sympathetic light, and it does succeed - after all, she was abused by her mother physically and psychologically, her father left the family, she left school at 15 to devote herself to skating.Much is made of the fact that she wasn't the typical pretty skater with beautiful skating costumes. Well, that's a little twisted, as one who followed it from the beginning and followed figure skating for years.It may have been that behind the scenes, the ice skating profession didn't approve of her. But Tonya was pretty, despite what she says, and she wasn't the first skater who didn't come from money - far from it, nor was she the first skater whose mother sewed her costumes. Skating is very expensive, and families sacrifice a great deal to get their kids training, shoes, costumes, ice time, and everything that goes with it.The film tries to make it seem as if Tonya was the only one with these hardships. Nancy Kerrigan comes from a middle-class family, with a legally blind mother, and if you want to talk tabloid fodder, her brother was accused of killing her father.My major problem with Tonya has always been that she was a powerful skater, an excellent athlete, and she would have been on the Olympic team without anyone's knee being shattered. The subsequent notoriety and problems with her husband ruined her Olympic performance, which was sluggish - she was obviously out of shape. So what was accomplished?As the movie shows us, it's now years later. Tonya was young, she made some mistakes, time to move on. After some false starts, it seems like she has. Everyone deserves a second chance. She recently made a good splash on Dancing with the Stars (which I believe pays something like $200,000 - so not bad) and she still practices her skating. She's married and has a child.You can't leave the film without hoping that things continue to work out for her. The film gives us an interesting perspective on her early life, her bad marriage, the knee-bashing incident, and the stupid people who carried it out (some real dark comedy there).Highly recommended, and I hope Tonya's new momentum keeps going. Time to take some responsibility instead of being a victim and move on.",7,1,1,13 September 2018
Molly's Game," You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
","'Molly's Game' from 2017 is the true story of Molly Bloom, an Olympic-qualifying skiier who, after a couple of bad accidents, moves to Los Angeles and starts running underground poker games.We see Molly (Jessica Chastain) as she works for an awful boss, Dean Keith (Jeremy Strong) for whom she runs underground game and gets tipped by the players. Eventually she starts her own game. An altercation with one of the players (Michael Cera, possibly Toby Maguire in the real story) ruins her game. She leaves Los Angeles and starts over in New York. It's from there that things go downhill.Once the Feds target her, Molly turns to an attorney (Idris Elba) who doesn't want her case. He winds up admiring Molly's discretion, which costs her a great deal.This is really a terrific film, carried by the wonderful Jessica Chastain. She's a strong actress who can show vulnerability, and she's impossibly beautiful. The real Molly came from a very accomplished family - her father a psychiatrist, her brother an Olympic and World Cup skiier - and Molly was on track to become a lawyer. Instead, she chooses money, cache, and glamour. As a result, she ends up living an empty and ultimately empty life.Bloom wanted Chastain to play her, and it was an excellent choice. Chastain was able to play Bloom as the smart, beautiful, attention-getting woman she was, and still is.Supposedly Leonardo di Caprio was also part of Molly's games. He's the character who has on earphones while playing. Sorkin used real poker players in the film.This is a story of survival. Molly Bloom learned the hard way, you can look like you have it all and have nothing.",8,2,2,15 May 2020
Crash," Excellent look at racism, assumptions, and prejudice
","Paul Haggis has done an amazing job writing and directing 'Crash,' which gives the viewer a glimpse into the lives of several people and shows the effect of racism, making assumptions about people based on stereotyping, and how prejudice has invaded all of our lives. Haggis' film style reminded me a little of Robert Altman's films and a little of 'Magnolia.' Granted, the subject is racism, so the stories all involve it, giving one the impression that every single person in America is prejudiced 24/7. And maybe we are! Maybe it's so deep-seated sometimes that we're prejudiced without even realizing it and make decisions based on these prejudices every day. Haggis asks us to examine ourselves while we're examining this microcosm of people.There is some wonderful acting in 'Crash' - that of Sandra Bullock, Thandie Newton, who is particularly powerful, Matt Dillon in a performance that should take his career in a new direction, Terrence Howard, Don Cheadle, Ludicrous, Brendan Fraser et al. - all first rate.The gun show salesman who calls a store owner 'Osama,'; the store owner who accuses a locksmith of trying to cheat him; a DA's wife who is convinced this same locksmith will copy her keys and come back later to rob her; the policeman with problems at home who acts horribly toward a black man and his wife and then becomes a hero; making fun of the way someone talks; being disrespectful of your Hispanic housekeeper who is probably your only friend - rage, rage, and more rage. When Haggis shows us the full human being in many of these cases, stripped of their race, profession, color, accent, wealth or poverty - all they are is people - angry, vulnerable, afraid, and hard-working.'Crash' is a provocative film with many riveting sections - both scenes involving Newton and Dillon are astounding - and the encounter at the locksmith's home has one of the most frightening moments you'll ever experience. In the end, you're left with the realization that we're all the same, and by making assumptions about one another, we put up walls, we spoil what could be a decent situation. 'You think you know who you are?' Matt Dillon asks Ryan Phillippe. More importantly, do we recognize the other person for who they are?",9,1,9,21 February 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Attend the tale
","'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,' directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, is based on the Stephen Sondheim musical from the 1970s. I remember sitting stage right, down front, in the theater when I saw this musical with Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou and being completely, utterly blown away. As a stage show, it was jaw-dropping, with some of Sondheim's most beautiful music: 'Johanna' is perhaps my favorite of all Sondheim's songs, but the score also includes the beautiful 'Not While I'm Around' and 'Pretty Women.' Seeing the film is a different experience from seeing the musical. Burton does a marvelous with it, blending the macabre grand guignol with the cartoonish and also with reality, overall giving the movie a really murky atmosphere. 'By the Sea' was, for me, pure Burton. Depp, Carter, Rickman, Ed Sanders, Jamie Bower, etc., are all excellent, Sacha Baron Cohen does a great turn as Pirelli. Sweeney can be a great singer, as he usually is on stage, but he really doesn't have to be, and Depp and Carter match well. The singers need to be Joanna, Anthony, the judge, and Toby if at all possible. They all sing very well in the film, and the orchestrations are fantastic, 'Johanna' and 'Pretty Women' being the highlights.The 'gore' looked fake so it wouldn't be too off-putting; it off-put me anyway. More than that, the entire story is sickening - somehow the distance between the audience and the stage makes it more palatable. Plus, the original show has a much lighter touch and, in the character of Mrs. Lovett, a good deal of humor. Burton plays the story much darker. I literally gagged a few times. I would have been better off just listening to the soundtrack.In the end - not my thing, but this extravagant musical may surely be yours.",7,2,3,30 January 2009
Blades of Glory," Very funny, very silly
","I skip most current comedies because the humor is geared to the lowest common denominator, and I prefer the screwball comedies of the '30s and the more sophisticated comedies. So normally I wouldn't have seen 'Blades of Glory' except that I am a figure skating fan. It's the story of two top American figure skaters, Chazz and Jimmy (played by Will Ferrell and John Heder), two bitter enemies, who, after a fight on the winners podium are stripped of their medals and banned from skating. Jimmy ends up working in a sports shoe store and Chazz wears a costume in a children's' skating shoe. Jimmy's stalker finds a notation in the rule book that indicates that he only can't re-enter the mens single competition. It says nothing about pairs. Unable to find a female partner, Jimmy's old coach hooks him up with the macho, drunken Chazz Michael Michaels, who was skating's bad boy.This is a very funny film with good acting, good characterizations, amazing skating, and a lot of slapstick. Particularly if you're a figure skating fan and have followed it over the years, you will appreciate the enthusiasm and seriousness of the commentators, in particular, Scott Hamilton. I have no idea how he kept a straight face, but it made the film even funnier. The routines, the costumes - the whole parody of the skating world is perfect. I especially liked the Van Waldenbergs' irreverent routine based on the JFK-Marilyn Monroe romance, which begins with Kennedy saying 'Ich bin ein Berliner' and has Marilyn, in her famous white dress with the halter top, popping pills and posing as she did over the street grate in 'The Seven Year Itch.' HILARIOUS.The references to skating stars like Michelle Kwan, who supposedly wanted to marry the Will Ferrell character, Oksana Baiul (who is colder than dry ice? OKSANA) and Kristy Yamaguchi was especially appreciated, as was seeing Brian Boitano, Dorothy Hamill, Peggy Fleming and Nancy Kerrigan in the film.It was one laugh out loud moment after another. Even if this type of movie with its sporadic vulgarity and sex jokes isn't for you, if you've been a fan of figure skating in the past 10 years and remember the Nancy-Tanya debacle, you will enjoy 'Blades of Glory.'",8,2,3,25 November 2007
Horrible Bosses," some excellent acting, some funny sequences
","I'll watch Jason Bateman in anything, so I watched 'Horrible Bosses' from 2011. Besides Bateman, the cast includes Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, Jennifer Aniston, Jason Sudeikis, and Donald Sutherland.Three best friends hate their jobs. At a brokerage firm, Nick (Bateman) works his fingers to the bone for his boss (Spacey) who dangles a big promotion over his head if he can stop coming in two minutes late. Then Nick doesn't get it. Jason Sudeikis is Kurt, who loved his job until his boss (Sutherland) dies suddenly, leaving his cokehead son Bobby (Pellit) in charge. Bobby tells Kurt the place is just one big ATM for him and he plans on milking it dry.Then he orders Kurt to fire a fat woman and a man in a wheelchair. Salt of the earth. And Charlie (Dale Arbus) is a dental assistant constantly being sexually harassed by his sexy boss Julia, played by a very hot brunette Jennifer Aniston. Charlie's engaged, and Julia holds the threat of telling his fiancé that Charlie is sleeping with her (which he isn't) if he doesn't come across.They decide the only thing they can do is kill their bosses. The three hire a hit man (Jamie Foxx), so they think, but after he takes $5000 he tells them he can only be a consultant because he can't go back to prison. He suggests that they do one another's murders so suspicion won't fall on them.It's easier than it sounds, and things go from bad to worse when a home invasion leads to coke being inhaled as it flies through the air, an allergy attack, a suspicious husband, a shooting they witness, and other things that get in their way.There are some hilarious scenes and some great dialogue in this film, and the acting is outstanding. Both Aniston and Farrell are not recognizable and in different roles than they usually play. They are both terrific. Bateman has his usual great delivery, and Spacey is excellent as one mean, horrible boss.There was also some vulgarity to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and that's why I don't like today's comedies. However, I did like this one for many reasons. The characters are well- developed and become involved in bizarre circumstances - usually of their own making. And don't miss the outtakes at the end.",6,1,2,14 September 2016
Black Mass," long, slow paced Boston mob movie
","From 2015, Black Mass is the story of Boston mobster Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp), the boss of the Boston Irish Mob called the Winter Hill Gang. His brother was President of the Massachusetts Senate, William Bulger, here played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Under investigator John Connelly (Joel Edgerton), Whitey served as an informant, with Connelly giving information to the FBI. Whitey's crimes were ignored as he fed them info on other gangs, using the FBI to destroy other gangs while his stayed in power. Once his activities - drugs, murder, racketeering, money laundering, Irish gun running, and extortion were exposed, everyone was humiliated. Bulger took off for sixteen years, finally arrested at the age of 81 in California, and is now in prison.The performances are all terrific. I lived in Boston and I personally saw nothing wrong with Benedict Cumberbatch's accent, or anyone else's -- when people don't want to like you, they don't, and that's it. Edgerton and the rest of the cast were very effective.Depp is terrifying, keeping his voice low but ready to snap at any second. A marvelous performance. I'm not sure why Cumberbatch did this film - he doesn't have a very large role. He reminded me a little of Dennis Quaid here, though I'm not sure why.Truth be told, I watched this because I love Depp and Cumberbatch, but this to me was not a great movie. Lots of violence and the f-bomb every other word is fine, but putting up with all that blood just wasn't worth it. In the hands of a less experienced cast, I think this would have a real dud.I think the pace could have been much better, and at 2 hours and 3 minutes, maybe 10 or 15 minutes -- a couple of strangulations perhaps - could have been cut. We got the point - cross him and he'll kill you.",6,2,2,20 February 2016
The Town," good work from Ben Affleck on all counts
","'The Town' is a 2010 film written by, directed by, and starring Ben Affleck. Needless to say, it's set in and around Boston.Affleck plays Doug McRay, a robber whose specialty is robbing payroll and bank trucks, though he and his buddies have done a couple of banks. On one of the robberies, an assistant manager (Rebecca Hall) is taken hostage by one of the gang (Jeremy Renner). When he sees her driver's license, he realizes that she only lives four blocks away from one of the gang and starts getting worried she'll recognize him, although they both wore masks.Doug manages to run into her at the laundromat; she doesn't recognize him, and the two start a relationship. Meanwhile, the FBI, led by Jon Hamm of 'Mad Men' is closing in, and Doug wants out. However, he finds that getting out isn't as easy at it seems.Affleck and his cowriters haven't penned the world's most original script, though it has some interesting features. It was fun to see the Boston and surrounding locations, and the car chases were terrific. You have to accept a certain amount of dramatic license as there are a couple of holes. The acting is good, from Affleck, Hall, Renner, Chris Cooper, who plays Affleck's imprisoned father, Hamm, and Pete Postlethwaite. Hall has gone on to become a major leading woman in Britain.Affleck has proved his directing mettle with 'Argo' and 'Gone Baby Gone' certainly and he just needs to continue his good work in this area. I'm sure everyone thought his career was over after 'Gigli' -- I think Affleck has even more surprises in store.",7,0,0,17 August 2013
Closer," Farther
","I couldn't wait to see this movie. Now, I realize I should have waited to see this movie until it could be rented.This is a very cold film about some very unpleasant people who don't seem to be able to make up their minds about much. I liked the way it was done, I loved the acting, and I loved the use of 'Cosi Fan Tutte' throughout the film. Yet it left me feeling empty. I never saw the play, but I imagine it was quite powerful. As a film, it had a deadly detachment.Certainly when one looks at a film like Virginia Woolf, also based on a play, also directed by Mike Nichols, also about some unpleasant people, one wonders why Woolf came off so well and this one didn't (for me, anyway). I think it's because Virginia Woolf is an incredible love story - at the end, when George explains that they're childless, and Martha says 'We couldn't' [have a baby], one realizes what's underneath all of the unpleasantness. In 'Closer,' there's just no payoff. Four people change partners, hurt one another, are seemingly incapable of doing anything else, but no one tells us why. Only the Natalie Portman character shows some humanity. But some isn't enough.Mike Nichols is a fabulous director, but the direction wasn't the problem here. It's the characterizations. I can't agree with some of the other posters that the film was fascinating. I didn't find it so. The theater was packed because of good reviews. I suppose the critics are hungry for something intelligent, and obviously the ticket-buying audience is, and who can blame them? But don't tell me this is the best you can come up with. When everybody walks out of the theater complaining, as they did after the showing I attended, there's a problem.",5,3,5,4 December 2004
Battleship Potemkin," in a word, magnificent
","There's very little I can say about Sergei Eisenstein's masterpiece 'Battleship Potemkin' that hasn't been said and said better by my fellow reviewers on this site.At 85 years old, this story of a ship's mutiny that leads to a Russian massacre still holds up - and you can't say that about a lot of 85-year-olds. In fact, if one were to have The Odessa Steps segment in a film today, it would be met with with the same jaw-dropping amazement as it must have been in 1925.Besides his brilliant montages, Eisenstein gives us some awesome visual moments - the parades of people walking down to the ship, the fuel of the ship curling out against the ocean sky; the sails on the water, and the dramatic way the film ends as the ship moves toward us - all breathtaking.But I am in complete amazement over The Odessa Steps segment, the entire thing, of which the massacre on the steps is a part. The baby carriage part was homaged in 'The Untouchables' - the whole thing is mind-boggling.A must see.",10,4,6,5 July 2010
Capote," His greatest success - and his greatest failure
","Philip Seymour Hoffman is 'Capote' in this meticulously made 2005 film, with a script by Dan Futterman and directed by Bennett Miller. To say that Mr. Hoffman, who, by the way, is from my home town, IS Capote gives his performance an apt description. This is no portrayal. You believe you are watching the funny, quirky and sad Capote throughout.The film focuses on Capote's interest in the Clutter murders, immortalized in his book, 'In Cold Blood.' Capote goes with his good friend, Harper Lee, who is not yet famous, to Holcomb, Kansas, in order to do an article for the New Yorker. He decides instead to write a book. The book becomes his greatest triumph and probably is responsible for ruining the man forever.The story of the relationship between Truman and one of the killers, Perry Smith, is brilliantly shown in all its complications. Each uses the other - Perry sees Truman as his get out of jail free card, and Truman sees Perry as his insight into the murders. Smith plays on Truman's feelings for all he's worth, showing himself to be a sensitive artist who, in his own words, thought Mr. Clutter was a nice, gentle man up until the time he slit his throat. On his end, Truman lies his face off to Perry - no, he doesn't have a title for his book, he hasn't written much, Perry's sister misses him, etc. But along the way, Capote begins to feels a kinship for this young man, who shares a similar unhappy childhood with him. He attempts to detach himself from the situation as the killers get stays of execution, but finally, it's too much. He can't finish the book because they're not dead, and the constant notes from Perry are driving him crazy. Perry asks for help in getting another lawyer; Truman writes him a letter and says that he's tried but he can't. We know he didn't try. Capote has what can best be described as a nervous breakdown when, in between drinking bouts, he takes to his bed and stops talking. Once he returns to Kansas, he will witness events that will haunt him for the rest of his life.Hoffman is perfection as the tortured Capote, and the rest of the cast - Caroline Keener, Clifton Collins, Mark Pellegrino, Chris Cooper and Bruce Greenwood is uniformly excellent, with Collins as the soulful-eyed Perry a standout. Keener's straightforward acting as Harper Lee is a nice juxtaposition to the outrageous Truman. The film is made with incredible attention to detail to set the atmosphere of '50s Kansas, right down to the clothing and color pallet chosen for the film.'In Cold Blood' was a career-making book - and the last book Capote ever finished. In the DVD commentary, someone said that Capote probably helped Perry to come to terms with what he'd done. After seeing documentaries involving these murders, it seems clear that Perry never accepted what he'd done and always saw himself as a victim, complaining that he could have been a great artist. But although they each had bad childhoods, Capote ended up as a world-famous author while Perry wound up a cold-blooded murderer.'There are more tears shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones,' Capote writes in his unfinished novel, 'Answered Prayers.' In reality, this is a quote from St. Theresa of Avila, and it fits in Capote's case. For the rest of his life, Capote would have to live with the great fame he sought being the result of murder and the fact that, for his mental torture to stop and for his book to complete, he wanted and needed the killers to be dead.",10,2,3,21 September 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," Fun in Vegas
","The usual suspects get together for 'Ocean's Thirteen,' the usual suspects being George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, and Andy Garcia. This time the villain of the piece is Al Pacino, as hotel mogul Willy Bank, who cheats the now-ill Reuben out of his share of the business. Danny wants to get Reuben what's his. Ellen Barkin plays Pacino's assistant. She's a 'cougar.' As usual, the gang's plan to bring down Bank is preposterous, filled with technological gimmicks, rigging all of the betting machines and the dice, etc., as they deal with worker problems at one of the manufacturers in Mexico. It's fun to see it come together. However, it's also a little confusing and nowhere near as entertaining as Ocean's Eleven. The best part of the film for me was the gang's efforts at destroying the stay of someone there to review the hotel (David Paymer) - hilarious.What makes these films watchable is the terrific casts, even if they are just having a good time. And the movie star presence is mighty formidable.Certainly entertaining and worth renting.",7,0,1,29 January 2010
Doctor Strange," Benedict
","I was so lucky to have seen Benedict Cumberbatch twice in one week, once as Hamlet (which I also saw in London) and then yesterday as Dr. Strange. One word for the man: Magnificent.This time he's Dr. Stephen Strange, a brilliant neurosurgeon (with an excellent American accent) who loses the use of his hands in a dreadful car accident. He is advised to go to a place in India to be healed, since modern medicine can do nothing. There he meets the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) who introduces him to the magical arts and tells him that he can heal himself. Strange learns that the temple is a secret group out to save the world from the dark forces, led by Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen). He has stolen a page from an ancient, secret book and taken off with three zealots. There is fear he will take over the world with the help of Dormammu.The highlight of this film, besides Cumberbatch, is the incredible special effects that are eye-popping. The film goes by very quickly. The cast is top notch, with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, and Rachel Adams along with those mentioned above. One word of caution - in order to see the whole film, you need to stay through the entire credits to the end, as there is a scene during the credits, and then at the end of the credits, there is another scene. This one is critical and sets up the next installment.British actors come over here to make money, and I can't criticize Cumberbatch for taking on this franchise. Is it the way I would have gone with his career? No. I would have preferred him to go the Eddie Redmayne or Sir Anthony Hopkins route, and I frankly don't understand some of his film choices. I suppose they were all part of a build-up, but why appear in Black Mass in a supporting role and Zoolander 2?His television work has been exemplary and more along classical lines; he has formed a production company, so let's hope the material matches the abilities of this man's talent.Anyway, see Dr. Strange. It's fun, amazing to look at, and has excellent acting. It's more than I can say about the endless previews we sat through.",8,2,6,18 November 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Anger begets more anger
","Frances McDormand is a grieving mother who puts up 'Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri' in this 2017 black comedy directed by Martin McDonagh.Mildred Hayes (McDormand) is disgusted that the police haven't found her daughter's rapist and killer, so she takes out billboards asking why the chief of police, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) hasn't done anything about the case.The billboards set off anger, violence, and revenge motifs in this small town. Things become worse when a pent-up police officer, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) becomes enraged and starts acting out.Lots of swearing, lots of violence, and lots of laughs to be had in this film. It was strange to watch as I had just seen another film, Past Life, that focused on the subject of anger and pain, and how it can eat a person up and destroy them. This film is yet another good illustration of that, as Mildred stops at nothing to make a point.The one-liners are amazing, and Mildred's speech to the priest who comes by to ask her to remove the billboards is hilarious. The movie is filled with strong performances and equally well-developed characters. We see all of their sides - violent, kind, vengeful, angry, sad; we finally realize they're just people driven in some cases to extremes.Harrelson's performance is touching -- we're prepared to dislike him but his sincerity and humanity come through. As Dixon, Rockwell seems like a monster, but once he acts out, he's able to focus his energy a little better.And then there's McDormand, a powerhouse. She's not good ol' Marge in Fargo. She's a tough woman with a broken heart who takes out her anger any way she can. It's a beautiful, multilayered performance. Highly recommended, asking the questions of where revenge and hatred can take us, and deciding when and if it stops.",8,156,240,7 December 2017
The Devil Wears Prada," The inspiration for Ugly Betty
","I don't know when the wonderful TV series 'Ugly Betty' was conceived, but the parallels with 'The Devil Wears Prada' are numerous. Anne Hathaway is Andy, a sweet young aspiring journalist with no fashion sense who is, to everyone's shock, hired by the boss from right out of hell, Miranda (Meryl Streep), editor in chief of Runway Magazine. Confessing that every other assistant has been horrible, Miranda, while telling off Andy says, 'So I said to myself, take a chance, hire the smart fat girl.' Andy learns fashion from one of Miranda's fashion henchmen, Nigel (Stanley Tucci), and slowly but surely gets more and more sucked into Miranda's demands and life at Runway. Her friends notice a change, and her boyfriend believes they no longer have anything in common. 'Wait until your life blows up in your face,' Nigel advises her, 'then it will be time for a promotion.' The bitchy world of fashion is fun to watch. No one eats and everyone is shallow. Size 6 is the new size 14, so says Nigel. The politics are behind closed doors, vicious, and make for a rousing scene in the film - and a look at just how evil and disloyal people can be. It's never anything personal; it's just the way it is.And that is what's not fun. Too many people have told me that Mildred 'is my boss.' It's hard to believe but it must be true. And the politics? Having once been a victim of behind closed door politics myself, I can attest that they, too, are equally true. While it gives one a few chuckles in a film, the reality is that corporate life today is ugly.I enjoyed 'The Devil Wears Prada' very much, particularly the marvelous performances of Streep, Tucci, Hathaway, and Emily Blunt as a frazzled ex-assistant, Hathaway, and the sexiness of Simon Baker. However, I basically felt like it was a movie for really young people. I'm not the target audience. And that's another thing: the message about women, targeted to really young women, has been Hollywood's message about women since there was a Hollywood. If you want to be miserable, be a powerful person in your chosen field. There, you will find yourself alone, i.e., manless. It gets a little tired after a while.If the message is tired, the production values, the performances, and the clothes are anything but. There's some great humor to be had as well. I saw this on DVD and had a miserable time adjusting the volume. The music was too loud and the voices too loud - proof that I'm not the target audience.",7,0,1,13 January 2007
Gone Baby Gone," Excellent, and a great directorial debut for Ben Affleck
","Ben Affleck has taken a lot of criticism in recent years; kudos to him for staying in the fight. Here he makes his directorial debut in 'Gone Baby Gone,' and takes a hand in the screenplay with Aaron Stockard. The story's pedigree is excellent, as it's based on a book by the author of 'Mystic River,' Dennis Lehane.Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan are private investigators in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who are hired by the family of a kidnapped four-year-old girl. Though the police are on the case, it's felt that these two have some good connections and can get people to talk. It turns out to be a much more complicated situation than they realized, and comes down to, finally, a moral dilemma for the detectives.Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are the law here and give excellent performances, as does the low-key Affleck, who plays his role very realistically. Monaghan is very good with him, and their conflict is an interesting one that you'll be giving quite a bit of thought about after you see this film.Having watched a lot of Nancy Grace, I don't have any doubt what I would do, but everyone will come away with a different opinion, I think. Truly a stunning film, murky, and capturing the working class atmosphere of Dorchester and the society we live in, where there are no easy answers anymore, if there ever were.",8,0,0,3 January 2010
Bridget Jones's Diary," a pure delight
","Wonderful film with a fantastic performance by the super-talented Renee Zwelleger, ably supported by Colin Firth and Hugh Grant, both marvelous, as was the entire cast.Strangely, I saw this film and 'Someone Like You' around the same time -the basic plots are the same, though the subplots are quite different.  And, of course, both use the song 'Someone Like You' at the end!  But Bridget Jones is a real film and Someone Like You a TV movie reject someone got Ashley Judd to star in.  Amazing how the same basic plot can be so differently handled.There were many laugh out loud moments, to the extent that a man behind me said, 'I'd like to hear the movie,' after Hugh Grant gave a line reading that rocked the audience.  I had one criticism and that was that the film could have been a little shorter.  Bravo, Renee and the entire cast on a great time at the movies.",8,0,0,13 May 2001
Captain America: The First Avenger," fun
","I will say up front I know nothing about Captain America, nothing about Marvel Comics, and I'm not a connoisseur of special effects.That all being said, Captain America was highly entertaining.Chris Evans is the scrawny Steve Rogers, who, after trying without fail to get into World War II, is chosen by a scientist, Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) for an experiment called Project Rebirth. Steve is transformed into the superhuman to create the all-powerful man, who becomes Captain America. Dr. Erskine is assassinated by a HYDRA agent - HYDRA being the Nazi secret research.Initially Rogers is misused, sent out to sell war bonds. However, he abandons this when his good friend Bucky and his unit are caught behind enemy lines. Then he finally gets into the war as he has always wanted.Great cast, including Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Toby Jones, Neal McDonough, and Samuel L. Jackson.I really liked the effects, although I gather some people thought they weren't that good. What I liked the most was the old-fashioned ambiance, which was very well done.Enjoyable.",7,0,2,1 March 2014
American Hustle," do the Hustle
","Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jeremy Renner do the 'American Hustle' in this 2013 film, directed by David O. Russell, who co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Singer.It is 1978. Con artist and imprisoned Irving Rosenthal (Bale) and his partner Sydney (Adams) have to work with an FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Cooper) to bring down white collar criminals in order to be free of all charges. Eventually. Richie and Irving are led to the rebuilding of Atlantic City into an east-coast Las Vegas, a project that will be rich with payoffs to politicians and investment scams. Irving, Sydney (known as Ethel in her British accent) and Richie get to work, meeting with the mayor of the city, Carmine Polito (Renner) who sincerely wants to put people back to work and bring in revenue for the city and state. Unfortunately, he seems to believe the end justifies the means and is willing to break the law to achieve his dream of a gambling mecca.The situation goes from edgy to downright scary when the mob (led by Robert de Niro) comes to town to talk with the fake sheik (actually from Mexico) about making a $10 million investment.This is an absolutely hilarious film with wonderful performances and bizarre situations. Part of the beginning is Christian Bale working on his hair, teasing, pasting on pieces, and then spraying. We're actually brought into the middle of a situation, and the film works back. We see Sydney's and Irving's stories, we see them meet and fall in love, and developing their various cons, fake loan sharking (charging $5000 to loan $50,000 but the mark never sees the $50,000) and a fake art scam.We learn that Irving is married to Rosalyn (Lawrence) and he has adopted Rosalyn's son from her first marriage. For this reason, he is reluctant to leave her. The problem is, out in public, she has a tendency to drink too much and say too much.Part of the charm of this film is the '70s atmosphere -- gold-dipped wall patterns, carpeting, heavy furniture, black and white photos of babies, the discos, Nehru jackets, bouffants, streaked hair, girdles, stereos, and the music: Bee Gees, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Billy Joel, Steely Dan, America, and Irving and Sydney's favorite throwback, Duke Ellington. I'll admit that I don't really remember the style dress Amy Adams wore throughout the film, cut down to her navel with part of each boob showing.The film has lively, wild performances by Christian Bale, with a gut sticking out and horrid hair -- when a leading man, especially a handsome one, does that, it gets a lot of attention. But Bale follows through with a great performance. Adams is sexy and funny. Lawrence is hilarious. Some might say that she and Elizabeth Rohm, who plays the mayor's wife, are caricatures, but frankly, they were like a lot of women I've known. Jeremy Renner as the mayor is wonderful - sincere, naive, and a little low class. And Bradley Cooper as a man living with his mother and engaged to a girl from the neighborhood is fantastic as a no-boundaries FBI agent.Just marvelous, particularly for my generation. I had a blast.",10,3,9,18 January 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," action, action, action
","With 'The Bourne Ultimatum,' director Paul Greengrass again gives us non-stop, breathless action as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) races toward a destination with his true identity. There's a crackerjack cast along to either aide him with his quest or keep him from it - Joan Allen, David Straithairn, Albert Finney, Julia Stiles, and Scott Glenn.This time around, Bourne is believed to be a CIA mole who has given a story about Blackbriar, an assassins program, to a newspaper reporter. Seeing his name in the story, Bourne contacts the reporter, and the CIA is all over him. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) knows that he's not the mole -- that Bourne tries to avoid the government. Bourne wants to know the name of the mole, too, because that person can tell him his true identity and why he is a killer. So who gets there first, the ruthless CIA agent (Straithairn) and his cronies, or Bourne? Excellent acting with another great performance by Matt Damon, a wild car chase, shootings, stalkings, great suspense, and plenty of it, will keep you on the edge of your seat, as was true in the previous two films.Based on the Robert Ludlum books, the film versions of the trilogy are among the best and most exciting films around. I saw the first film in a Miami theater, a WOW experience, and I remember my heart being in my throat during the entire second film. I guess I think they're all wonderful.",10,1,2,7 July 2010
Fargo," You have no call to get snippy with me.
","I just love McDormand's face when she says that line - she takes a beat, her facial expression doesn't change, and then it comes out of her mouth like she's ordering a hamburger. Brilliant.This is one of my all time favorite movies. I saw it the first day it opened in New York City, and I loved it. I've seen it again since. What strikes me during repeated viewings is the spareness of it. Fargo moves very quickly and there isn't anything peripheral in it, no fillers. It's just a great movie and a great story with great characterizations. Wow, when I put it that way, it sounds like anyone could do it. Would that were true.There's no point in going through the story. I'll just write that Frances McDormand is sensational, as is everyone in the film - she and William H. Macy are standouts. You can really feel his desperation.There are so many great scenes - when Marge thinks she's going to barf, the scene with Macy referenced above, her little lecture to the criminals, the stamp discussion. And who can forget her old friend from high school? That scene is priceless! I also love the endless expanse of snow when the search for the money begins.This film was a real high point for me. It is a true masterpiece done by two of our most imaginative filmmakers and starring one of our finest actresses. What can I say, except I'm heading out to the wood chipper.",10,1,2,2 October 2005
The Aviator," a mad genius
","You really can't miss when doing a biography of Howard Hughes, certainly one of the most brilliant, glamorous, eccentric, and fascinating men who ever lived. And for me, Leonardo DiCaprio and Scorcese don't miss. DiCaprio's portrayal of Hughes is a revelation. (I'll digress here to say, for those who have accused him of being short, I've seen him in person - he's not short.) He does a fantastic job as Hughes. You can almost hear his inner dialogue. As for Scorcese, the movie is truly spectacular in its breadth.I was disappointed in a couple of elements. One was, with the care Cate Blanchett gave to her portrayal of Hepburn, one would have hoped that a little attention had been paid to the casting of the other women in Hughes' life: Faith Domergue, Ava Gardner, Jean Harlow. Of the three, I liked Kate Beckinsale's Ava the best - but for me, Ava Gardner's beauty is unparalleled. Beckinsale really didn't approach it. And Stefani was wrong, wrong, wrong. How hard can it be to find a young actress (and Harlow was 19, not 35, when she appeared in Hell's Angel's), and slap a platinum wig and a white clinging gown on her? Harlow's look was very distinctive, and when it's off, it's distracting.The other thing I was disappointed in - and I suppose this couldn't be helped in a way - was the telescoping of the years and some unnecessary inaccuracies. I don't pretend to be an expert on Hughes. I've seen one documentary on him which was fantastic, and now I want to read about him. But Katharine Hepburn talks about the press showing up at her brother's funeral - I don't know why that would have been, since she wasn't famous yet. I realize her family was prominent, but she made it sound as if it had to do with her fame. She also labels herself as Box Office Poison way too soon, and the movie skips the entire Philadelphia Story, including Hughes giving her the money to buy the rights. No mention of most of the controversy over 'The Outlaw' which took several years to see a release.But these are minor, nitpicky points. This is a big, gorgeous film, with exciting, lush scenes and some fantastic performances.",9,0,1,19 February 2005
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," great improv by Williams
","'Good Morning Vietnam' is the story of Adrian Cronauer - well, that's how it started out - until Robin Williams got his hands on it. The real Cronauer actually didn't employ humor in his broadcasts. But I'm sure he was very happy to have a star such as Robin Williams interested in his story.In the '60s, Cronauer is assigned to the US Armed Services Radio station in Vietnam and finds it pretty dull with a lot of boring music playing. He immediately shakes things up with his broadcasts, which begin GOOD MORNING Vietnam. He makes a lot of jokes, plays a lot of rock music, and infuriates some of the powers that be with his total irreverence. He also develops a crush on a young woman (Chintara Sukapatana) and follows her one day to an English class. He ends up teaching some of the more colloquial phrases to the class, which is delighted, and he becomes friendly with the young woman's brother (Tung Thanh Tran). He starts hanging out at a local bar and even gets used to the food.Despite his immense popularity, the waves he is making threaten to get him drummed out, as he is unhappy about censored news and one day mentions a tragedy that occurred on the radio. Slowly, Cronauer sees more of the war, meets soldiers going into combat, and learns the hard way that he can't trust everyone, and he gets a big-time reality check.Filmed in Thailand, Good Morning, Vietnam is a really excellent film that combines comedy with drama, improvisation with a solid script and manages to show the horror of war and its effect on the citizens and soldiers.Williams, who improvises all of the radio shows, is marvelous as Cronauer, here a man who uses humor in his life until he is faced with some harsh truths -- and even then, in one of his darkest moments, he finds his sense of humor again. Forrest Whitaker, as a soldier working at the radio, gives a wonderful performance. As Lt. Steven Hauk, Bruno Kirby is brilliant as a delusional man who thinks his groan-worthy sense of humor and Mantovani music is just the ticket for a radio show.Well worth seeing by baby boomers for the nostalgia value (though not all good) and by anyone to appreciate the skills of Robin Williams as an actor and comic.",8,1,1,15 April 2012
The Italian Job," Enjoyable heist movie
","Criminals are betrayed by one of their own and become set on revenge in 'The Italian Job,) a 2003 film starring Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Donald Sutherland, Charlize Theron, and directed by F. Gary Gray. Gray never lets the pace up, keeping the viewer hooked all the way.The beginning of the film is really the best, when the thieves pull off an astounding heist of gold bullion in Venice. The scenery alone is worth the whole film. Then the action shifts to Los Angeles some time later. The thrills never really let up. It's reminiscent of 'Ocean's Eleven' where, if you stop and think about what the criminals are doing, you realize it's completely impossible, but you go along with it because it's so clever.What made the film especially interesting for me is that the story and execution really depended on the actors not at all. Someone commented that Charlize Theron was doing an Angelina Jolie role - all of the actors, while okay, were doing roles that could easily have been played by someone else. This includes Donald Sutherland's short but sympathetic role. Some films are dependent on special effects; this film is dependent on moving breathlessly from one thrilling car chase or dangerous situation to another. This was particularly true at the end, when every time it looked as if the situation was resolved, there was another roadblock to overcome.I did not see the original film but will seek it out. This 'Italian Job' is clever, with some humor thrown in, and very exciting. A highly recommended rental.",8,0,4,20 August 2007

He hides the money he makes in the floorboards of the apartment he shares with his foster father (C.J. Jones), who is deaf and in a wheelchair. The two sign to one another. That's good, because Baby doesn't talk much. He spends all tie listening to music via his earbuds - he has tinnitus from a childhood accident that killed his parents.Baby meets a waitress, Debora (Lily James) and falls for her - she doesn't know what he does. And the latest robbery involves some violent and very nasty characters (John Bernthal, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Elza Gonzalez). And that puts Baby, Joseph, and Debora in danger.Really excellent film with unbelievable car chases. Elgort has great moves as he dances around listening to his tunes. He underplays, but his feelings read in his face. The rest of the acting is excellent; Spacey and his gang are mean as dirt. Highly recommended.",9,0,1,6 October 2018
The Caine Mutiny," Wonderful performances
","Humphrey Bogart, Van Johnson, Fred MacMurray, Robert Francis, and Jose Ferrer are all involved in one way or another with 'The Caine Mutiny,' a 1954 film directed by Edward Dmytryk and based on the Herman Wouk novel.Bogart is Captain Queeg, who follows the no-nonsense Comdr. DeVriess (Tom Tully) as captain of The Caine, a worn out minesweeper. It becomes apparent almost immediately that he's not all there, particularly by Lt. Keefer (MacMurray), who's writing a novel in his spare time. I suppose today we would call Queeg burnt out from years of service on difficult missions. He's okay one minute, and the next he's got the ship running away from battle or conducting an exhaustive search for a strawberry pilferer. During a raging typhoon, he loses control of the ship and himself - in fact, his hand has to be pried off of an instrument, and he gives orders that would, if followed, sink the ship. The second in command, Lt. Maryk (Johnson) takes over the ship over Rule 184 of the Naval code, and everyone follows his orders. A court martial, with Lt. Greenwald (Ferrer) defending Maryk against his better judgment.It's hard to know what to say about the conclusion of this film and Greenwald's drunken speech, but it's an excellent movie with marvelous performances by all involved. Bogart is stupendous as the whacked out Queeg, and his increasing discomfort during testimony is masterful. The always likable Van Johnson does a great dramatic turn here, as does Fred MacMurray. I used to think of Fred MacMurray as the world's most bland actor - having seen a lot of his work now, he definitely could go well beyond 'My Three Sons.' His manipulative Keefer is central to the film. Robert Francis, who died at the age of 25 in a plane crash the following year, plays a newcomer to the Navy, Ensign Keith. Boyishly handsome and all-American looking, Francis was a perfect military type, and if his acting wasn't stupendous, he fit well into this type of film and held his own against the vets. He has an extraneous subplot involving a singer (May Wynn) whom he's in love with. Lee Marvin has a small role, but his knowledge of the Navy made him important, and he served as an unofficial adviser on the film.This is a complicated psychological drama that bears a good deal of thought. We who are not in the military or from military families undoubtedly cannot fathom the seriousness of an actual mutiny. The question is asked indirectly if it could have been avoided and blames everyone involved. Whether or not it could have been avoided, who knows. The fact is, Queeg couldn't handle his assignment. Since he wasn't going to say anything to the higher-ups, I suppose it would have been best if the others had gone to the Admiral as they planned and succeeded in getting him removed. Would they have succeeded? I wonder how likely that scenario is - possibly not very likely. So we're left with a bunch of people going down with their ship rather than cross the captain.In the end, The Caine Mutiny is the story of courage - Queeg had courage but suffered from battle fatigue; Maryk had the courage to make a controversial decision, but let himself be talked out of approaching the Admiral by Keefer; and Keefer was a yellow-bellowed sap sucker. It falls to Keith, the newcomer, to learn important lessons from each man. He starts by standing up to his mother - seeing his growth is probably the reason for the subplot.",8,2,4,31 January 2009
Footloose," Fun teen movie
","Kevin Bacon is 'Footloose' in this 1984 film which also stars John Lithgow, Dianne Wiest, Lori Singer, and Chris Penn. Bacon is Ren, the new kid in a town that doesn't allow dancing, and he sets out to change that.That's actually about all there is to the plot, except that Ren gets involved with pretty Ariel, the daughter of the preacher (John Lithgow). Ariel likes to play chicken with things like trains and cars. In fact, all these kids have hormones, impulses, and energy that are in desperate need of an outlet.'Footloose' has one of the best soundtracks ever, and some wonderful dancing. Despite its serious moments, it has a relentlessly upbeat and exuberant feel to it. Herb Ross directed; originally, it was supposed to be Michael Cimino. It certainly would have been a different film with him directing. Take 'Footloose' for what it is, don't ask for 'Citizen Kane,' and you'll love it.",8,1,3,20 January 2010
The Color of Money," Eddie Felson's back
","'Twenty five years ago, my career ended before it had even really started,' Eddie Felson tells Vince, a young pool shark. No longer the cocky man he was in 'The Hustler,' Eddie (Paul Newman) in 1986 is retired from pool and a successful investor. When he spots hot-shot Vince (Tom Cruise), he decides to invest in him and take him on the road, with the goal of Vince winning a big pool tournament in Atlantic City. Along the way, Eddie confronts what he was and is no more and looks at the dreams he let die. When Vince is too foolish and strong-willed to take his advice, Eddie makes an important decision.Though not as strong a film as 'The Hustler,' 'The Color of Money' is still an excellent film with a great cast led by Newman, at the peak of his 'older man' good looks and the brilliant acting he's always had. And, as usual, he tells you everything you need to know about a character. It's clear that he was content with his life and his attractive girlfriend (Helen Shaver) until he saw Vince. Then the old restlessness and competitiveness came creeping back into his blood.Seeing Tom Cruise in 1986 is startling since today, the lower half of his face has changed drastically due to plastic surgery. Here he conveys the raw, youthful energy that helped make him a star. Like many successful movie actors, he has a wonderful physical agility. His pompadoured Vince is a short-tempered, jealous, talented ingrate who can't help showing off. Cruise is very effective, as is Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio as his sultry, beautiful girlfriend in another role she made memorable in the '80s.Beautifully directed by Scorcese, 'The Color of Money' shows that it's never too late to follow your dreams and, with the right actors and the right script, you can do a good sequel even 25 years after the original.",8,22,27,8 October 2007
The Village," odd movie from Shyamalan but has his touch nonetheless
","I had no idea what to expect from M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Village,' since I had heard nothing but awful things about it. It wasn't awful; there was a lot good in it, as Shyamalan, unlike some, is a thoughtful filmmaker. I don't think he's the man with the problem. I think it's his audience. They go, as they did in Signs, expecting to see a scary alien movie and are disappointed. With Shymamalan, it's never what's on the surface; it's always what lies beneath. And no matter the plot, what lies beneath an M. Night Shyamalan film is spirituality and some of life's fundamental questions.The question here is: Can we really isolate ourselves from evil? A little village, bordered by a forest that contains some sort of evil creatures, is threatened when the creatures, for the first time, seem to be encroaching on the citizens' territory. When a near tragedy strikes, one of them (Bryce Dallas Howard) must go through those woods into the town - something never done.There are some scary scenes, to be sure, but Shyamalan for me is never about the scary scenes so I'm not going to object that 'The Village' wasn't terrifying enough. What I will say is that it does not have the pacing of his other films. It is drawn out with some slow patches in which nothing happens. Atmosphere is one thing, and it has plenty of that - but when that's all there is, a little judicious editing is called for.Bryce Dallas Howard, as the blind Ivy, seems to have inherited the family acting talent - she is a real find and does a marvelous job with a large and difficult role. Joaquin Phoenix as well is very good. And then there are the actors with whom I was young - Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt - class casting for sure, and the two pros give beautiful performances. Hurt is really making a niche for himself as a character actor. Weaver is still beautiful enough to play leads if she can get cast in one. Broadway star Cherry Jones seems to be a favorite of Shyamalan's, and she is again on hand in a small role. To cast even a bit part with a double Tony award winner shows good taste.Adrien Brody has had an odd career since his Oscar win. I advise him and Halle Berry, while we're at it, to get new agents. He plays what can best be described here as the village idiot. At first, I thought the character had Tourette's syndrome - well, there was something wrong anyway, and while I suppose he was good, I agree with one of the posters. He was annoying - a manic in a sea of soft-talking, well-mannered people.Be advised - M. Night Shyamalan doesn't make horror films. Strange sometimes, surprising, spiritual, romantic. But the aliens et al are just bogeymen asking us to confront what needs to be confronted.",7,3,4,7 April 2006
21," Loosely based on the true story
","'21' is the story of the famous MIT Blackjack Team that plays fast and loose with the real story. Nevertheless, it's still a compelling and interesting movie. It's really a morality tale about a brilliant young man, Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is talked by a professor (Kevin Spacey) into joining a blackjack group that counts cards, uses hand signals, codes, and disguises, and goes to Vegas every weekend. Ben has been accepted into Harvard pre-med but has no way of getting the $300,000 tuition. In this story, there are no such things as financial packages and student loans. Ben reluctantly joins the group but only until he can make his Harvard money. Of course, that's not what happens. Once in and living the high life, he can't stop. He finally becomes so arrogant that he makes what turns out to be a very costly mistake.The shots of Boston, where I went to school, and Vegas are great, and the acting is excellent. Sturgess is joined by the beautiful Kate Bosworth, Aaron Yoo, Liza Lapira, and Jacob Pitts. Laurence Fishburne has a small role, but he's scary as all get-out as a security man. Two real-life members of the Blackjack Team played card dealers.In the actual story, there were several of these groups out of MIT that played for years. In telescoping the story, there are a few holes. For instance, Campbell never wears a disguise until the end, which in real life, never happened. The only one who consistently wears a disguise is Bosworth; these teams were much more careful than that. Also, they seem to go to Vegas every week instead of switching off with Atlantic City, for instance, or laying low for a time.There are a few interesting twists in '21,' and it moves quickly. Recommended - a very good movie.",7,0,0,17 December 2008
Trouble with the Curve," lovely film
","Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams as father and daughter attempt to connect in 'Trouble with the Curve' from 2012.For those who criticized the baseball part of the film, asking if the production had a consultant, etc., I will say that the baseball was what Hitchcock called 'The McGuffin' - an excuse for the real story.Eastwood plays Gus, an Atlanta Braves scout who has been in the business for perhaps too long - he has macular degeneration and glaucoma - maybe - but he won't see a specialist. His daughter, Mickey, is a lawyer heading for partner in a high-powered Atlanta firm. It's scouting time again, and Gus' boss and friend Pete (John Goodman) is afraid he isn't up to it. There is a newcomer to the team administration who uses computers to choose players, and his eye is on a kid named Gentry. Nervous, Pete calls Mickey and asks her to go with her father to North Carolina and help him. Mickey is in the middle of the case that will make her partner, but she goes out of a sense of duty. Also, she wants her father to talk to her and explain why he abandoned her for much of her childhood. As a result, she pushes everyone away, including a scout they meet in North Carolina (Justin Timberlake) who is interested in her.This is a beautifully acted if predictable story about healing wounds and communicating, something that is difficult for an old- fashioned father to do. Clint Eastwood is an irascible character similar to his role in Gran Torino - he brings a lot of humor to the part as well as some powerful dramatic moments.Amy Adams looks for all the world like she's 28 - she was 38 when she made this, playing a 33-year-old. She brings a poignancy to her performance as a workaholic and vulnerable young woman.Very enjoyable, and I shed a few tears besides. Highly recommended.",8,1,1,23 June 2016
Bridge of Spies," interesting historical drama and a great performance
","'Bridge of Spies' from 2015 is about the Francis Gary Powers incident in the 1960s. As usual, with the exception of the Lincoln assassination, I remember it. This time, though, only vaguely.The U.S. arrested a Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and chose James Donovan (Tom Hanks) who had some experience in military cases, to defend him. Abel is found guilty but Donovan is able to convince the Judge to commute his sentence to life in case the U.S. needs him later - for instance, if we should want to exchange him for one of our own.That situation happens when Francis Gary Powers, taking aerial photographs for the CIA, is shot down and taken prisoner. Donovan is then sent to negotiate the exchange.For many people, this will be a slow, talky drama, with one big action scene, Powers being shot down, and one scene of tension (if you don't know the outcome).It is, however, a very good drama with Hanks giving a strong and sometimes humorous performance as Donovan, thrust into the world of international spies and negotiations. He takes it upon himself to also work for the freedom of an American student, Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) who was arrested for being at the wrong place at the wrong time. That student is the only person involved in the case who is alive today, at 83, and praised the film but thought they 'took a lot of liberties with it.' Well, that's Hollywood.The main reason, other than historical interest, to watch this film is the performance of Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel. A winner of three Tony awards, two Olivier awards, and a BAFTA, Rylance is a highly regarded stage actor, known as the best of his generation. He's made very few films but he's about to make more and take the film industry by storm.As Abel, Rylance creates a human being, portraying him as a quiet, unassuming older man sent to do a job. He bonds with Donovan, but he tells him that he's not afraid to die. He spends his time in prison drawing. It is a remarkable performance which has earned him an Oscar nomination.Strangely, many people involved in this incident didn't live too long after -- Abel, who returned to the Soviet Union and to his family, lectured for 10 years and died in 1971; Donovan died in 1970; and Powers died in a helicopter crash while working for a TV station in 1977.I hope the film will encourage some people to read up on this case - of course, I always hope that. Maybe some time somebody will do it rather than posting the question someone did about Gandhi -- was this a fictional character.",8,8,12,13 February 2016
Little Miss Sunshine," Chasing the American dream in a van with a bad clutch
","Abigail Breslin hopes to be 'Little Miss Sunshine' in this 2006 film also starring Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, Toni Collette, Steve Carell, and Paul Dano, directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris.The story concerns the efforts of the Hoover family to get the younger child, Olive (Breslin) to Redondo Beach to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. They can't afford to fly, nor can they leave Uncle Frank (Carell), the gay, suicidal brother of Sheryl Hoover (Collette) alone; they certainly can't leave him with Dwayne, Olive's brother, who hasn't talked in 9 months; Sheryl can't drive a stick shift; profane, porn-loving, heroin-snorting Grandpa (Arkin) has to go because he's coached Olive in her routine. So the whole family piles into the van to drive the 700 miles with dad (Kinnear), who pushes and preaches a program called 9 Steps to Winning, at the wheel.With an absolutely absurd, hilarious, and wonderful original script by Michael Arndt, this small film (costing $8 million) proved to be a mega-hit, and deservedly so, as the Hoovers realize that through all the dysfunction and disappointment, there's love, loyalty, and a sense of togetherness. The performances are fantastic. Toni Collette, as the mother who tries to keep it all together, again proves she should be up there with Meryl Streep. Greg Kinnear, as a frustrated, broke loser trying to sell his 9 steps to a publisher, gives a poignant performance, conveying the impression of being down - but never defeated. Arkin is hilarious. As the two odd men out, Paul Dano and Steve Carell are great, both realizing that despite abject misery and heartbreak, they're not as alone as they thought.As Olive, a normal-looking little girl with a paunchy stomach who wants to be a beauty queen amidst a sea of what looks like miniature hookers, Abigail Breslin gives an honest, sweet, and natural performance. Grandpa told her she's beautiful, and she is.A don't miss film that proves that sometimes, even without the material trappings of success, you have lots more than you think.",10,2,3,13 December 2009
Hugo," Breathtaking
","Reading some of the comments here, it appears the advertising for this was somewhat misleading, so people left the theater disappointed. I don't remember any advertising so I had no idea what to expect.'Hugo' from 2011 is a Martin Scorsese film based on the Brian Selznick book, The Invention of Hugo Cabret. Set in 1931, 12-year-old Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives in Paris with his father (Jude Law), a widowed clockmaker who also works at a museum. He finds a broken automaton, a mechanical man designed to write with a pen, at the museum, and Hugo and he try to repair it, his father writing down various steps in his notebook. When his father is killed in a fire, Hugo goes to live with an alcoholic uncle (Ray Winstone) who maintains the clocks at the railway station of Gare Montparnase. His uncle disappears one day, but Hugo stays on living in the clockworks and maintaining the clocks and steals items to repair the automaton. He also tries to avoid the Station Inspector Gustave (Sacha Baron Cohen) who will send him to an orphanage if he finds out his uncle is gone. When Hugo is caught stealing from the toy store, the owner, Georges (Ben Kingsley) confiscates Hugo's notebook. Hugo enlists the help of Georges' goddaughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) to retrieve it. It turns out that her godfather is the famous Georges Melies, a magician and film director who was responsible for many technical developments in the early days of film, including special effects and time-lapse photography. And the automaton was his invention. When his films went out of style after World War I, he dropped out of sight and sold toys.People went into this film expecting Hugo to have a great adventure, when in fact this is the story of George Melies and the very early days of film. I can't describe how beautiful and astonishing this film is, a true awe-inspiring feast for the eyes in 3D. Scenes from early silent films shown in the movie are Méliès's actual works, such as Le voyage dans la lune (1902), and they are stunning. We also see Harold Lloyd hanging from the clock in Safety Last, and Hugo having to do this later. The film also depicts the Montparnasse derailment of 1895. The acting is excellent, and though Butterfield's casting was criticized as being just because he was a beautiful child, I disagree. I think he was wonderful, as was Moretz. Ben Kingsley as the stern toy owner Georges who reveals himself as the heartbroken and brilliant Georges, is fantastic, and Helen McCrory is a standout as Georges' beautiful wife.A true masterpiece, told in storybook fashion, not to be missed.",9,2,4,30 June 2017
American Beauty," staggering
","An amazing and sad statement about American values, about having the courage to change your life totally when you feel you have nothing to lose, about finding out what's important just as it's too late.  A wow of a movie with so many dimensions, amplified by sensational performances. How can something be so depressing yet uplifting, be about parents who have screwed their lives up so horribly and yet give you hope that the young people have a chance to evolve?  I guess that's true genius.",10,1,2,1 June 2000
Salt," Total girl power, with Jolie at the helm
","Apparently 2010's 'Salt' was intended for Tom Cruise, but was rewritten for a woman when he backed out. The story is about a CIA agent, Evelyn Salt, who spends time in a prison in North Korea and only is released because of the nonstop efforts of her boyfriend (August Diehl), whom she marries.Ready to leave the office to celebrate their anniversary, Salt is asked to help interrogate a spy (Daniel Olbrychski) who has information and wants to defect. The spy, Orlov, claims that the Russian president will be assassinated at the vice-president's funeral by one of the many agents who were infiltrated into the American system by Russia: Evelyn Salt.Salt claims this is absurd, but seeing the looks on the faces of her boss (Liev Schreiber) and Secret Agent Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Salt realizes that they are going to keep her at the agency and question her. Desperate to reach her husband for fear he's been liquidated, Salt breaks out and escapes. What follows is a breathless chase that has Salt scaling buildings from the outside, jumping onto trucks, blowing up offices, and killing.Directed by Phillip Noyce and written by Kurt Wimmer, this is an incredible action film on the same level as one of the 'Bourne' movies, done at a lightning fast pace. Jolie, who did most of her own stunts, is remarkable as a tough, clever, resourceful, and athletic agent.The film moves so quickly that one is tempted to overlook some of the plot holes. If I like a movie, as I did here, I let them slide, as I will now, but I need to point them out because they're pretty glaring. The first one is, how is it possible that the CIA, for corn's sake, has no idea that Orlov, the spy who wants to defect, has a knife hidden in his shoe? The second one is far worse -- when Peabody tells Salt that no one will believe her story of what happened in the activation room, one wonders how this is possible. There are cameras in the hallways, the elevators, in the deepest recesses, yet in a room where an activating device for a nuclear attack is located, and where the President of the United States has to be to put in the code -- no cameras? No way to see what went on? Please! I'm sure there are others, and I realize the entire story is preposterous, but for me, this was a little too much dramatic license. I did love it, and I can't wait for the sequel. I hope there is one.",9,5,8,15 January 2011
We're the Millers," a low-level drug dealer is dispatched to Mexico
","Like some others on this board, I, too, had low expectations for this comedy. The main reason being, I don't like most comedies made today. They cater to the lowest common denominator and contain stupid sex and bathroom jokes.However, despite some stupid jokes along the way,'We're the Millers' is a funny comedy with a great premise and good performances.A low-level drug dealer, David (Jason Sudeikis) is robbed of money he was delivering to his boss, an old college friend. His friend, rather than killing him, says they can wipe the slate clean if he will pick up a very small stash of drugs in Mexico for him under his 'Mexican' name, 'Pablo Chacon.' David agrees, though reluctantly.He decides the best thing to do is travel as a tourist with a family to avoid interest from the police. He drafts a stripper who can't stand him (Jennifer Aniston) with the promise of money; a homeless girl, Casey (Emma Roberts), and a nerd (Will Poulter). Along the way they have to think fast, sometimes move faster, protect one another, and, without realizing it, they become a family.Lots of very funny stuff here, which comes out of the situations. And, despite the crazy characters, the movie has warmth. I wasn't that familiar with Jason Sudeikis' work as I don't watch Saturday Night Live, but he did a great job. I thought Aniston had the more interesting role. She plays a hard-edged stripper who finds herself at home in the role of mother. Road trip movies have an added advantage of introducing new characters all the time. And boy, did they meet a few.Very enjoyable.",7,1,2,30 October 2015
Disturbia," updated version of Rear Window for the young crowd
","Strictly speaking, this isn't a remake of Hitchcock's fabulous Rear Window; rather, it takes the same basic idea and runs with it. In Disturbia, a young man, Kale, (Shia LaBeouf) under house arrest for punching out his Spanish teacher, is bored out of his mind and starts spying on his neighbors. He becomes convinced that one of them (David Morse) is a murderer.Where Hitchcock depended on building suspense, Disturbia uses action for both humor and thriller elements. Kale figures out just how far he can go before his ankle device goes from green to red, meaning the police show up, and this becomes important to the story. His friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) does Kale's leg work (i.e., breaking and entering and rifling through the neighbor's car). Kale also makes use of a webcam.The love interest here is the pretty Sarah Roemer, another neighbor Kale spied on.Disturbia has some very exciting scenes and some fun ones, and because it's based on a solid story, it holds interest. The young characters are familiar and likable to anyone who deals with teens, and the acting is very natural. As the suspected neighbor, David Morse, who used to play good guys, makes a very effective sinister neighbor.I really liked this film and I highly recommend it. It wasn't made for my age bracket but nonetheless, I found it very entertaining and well done. Don't make the mistake of comparing it with Hitchcock. There was only one Hitchcock, and this is very different.",8,0,1,5 November 2011
Edward Scissorhands," Beautiful film
","Johnny Depp is 'Edward Scissorhands' in this 1990 Tim Burton film, directed and co-written by him with enchanting music by Danny Elfman. The film also stars Winona Ryder, Anthony Michael Hall, Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker, and Alan Arkin. Into a bright, pastel suburban world, a kind Avon lady, Peg (Wiest) takes a strange young man (Depp) out of a bleak mansion where he seems to be alone and brings him into her home. Dressed in black, with black unkempt hair, white skin (kind of Michael Jackson-esquire), Edward has scissors for hands. He is the creation of an elderly inventor who died before Edwad could be completed. Though quiet, Edward exhibits great artistry with his scissors, making ornate art forms from bushes. Soon, however, he falls in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Ryder) and becomes a threat to Jim, her abusive boyfriend. Jim manages to turn the entire neighborhood against Edward.The theme here is a common one for Burton, that people who don't fit in are people with souls who have something to give. He tells the story in such a poignant way - Edward rarely speaks except with his scissors, and the scissors create things of beauty. The end of the film is heartwrenching in one respect but in another says that beauty lasts forever, frozen in time, and that a spirit can go on and be felt even when the person himself is rejected. Certainly one of the great films. A real triumph.",9,0,0,16 November 2007
Silver Linings Playbook," My cherie amour
","Bradley Cooper has a 'Silver Linings Playbook' in this 2012 film directed by David O. Russell and also starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro.Delores Solatano brings her bipolar son Pat Jr. home from a mental health institution, although it's not recommended by the doctors. She also didn't tell her husband, Pat Solatano Sr., who is now a bookie.Pat Jr.'s history is checkered due to his illness. A former teacher, he came home one day and found his wife Nikki in the shower with another teacher while 'My Cherie Amour' played on the stereo. He beat the man to a pulp. His wife has a restraining order against him. Pat Jr. is now in mandatory therapy but refuses to take his medication because it makes him foggy. He thinks exercise and good health are the way to go. The first time he goes to the psychiatrist's office, 'My Cherie Amour' is playing in the reception room, and Pat trashes it.One night he looks for his wedding video and can't find it. He wakes his mother up, which wakes his father up -- and ultimately the entire neighborhood and the police.Delusional, Pat believes that if he gets in good physical shape, which he is doing, adopts a positive attitude and always looks for the 'silver linings,' his wife will come back to him.One night at a friend's house for dinner, he meets a widow and recovering sex addict, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). After a rocky beginning, Pat asks Tiffany if she will deliver a letter to Nikki. She will, on the condition that he is her dance partner in an upcoming contest. He reluctantly agrees.This is a wonderful, entertaining movie with heartfelt performances by all involved. The film shows the difficulty in dealing with bipolar illness not just for the person who has it, but the whole family, and how in some ways it has ripped them apart. So there is healing needed for the entire family.I remember when Bradley Cooper was on Alias. He was a cute young leading man with a pleasant personality who had obviously been picked up by a top agency, as he started showing up in movies. It turns out that he has a tremendous talent. His performance here is very honest as a man always on the edge who fights for control and is determined to meet his goals. 'You have to have a strategy,' his therapist (Anupam Kehr) keeps telling him. Kehr is excellent as Pat's low-key therapist.Jennifer Lawrence does a great job as Tiffany -- some people don't like her acting style, which is very overt, but I do. She is very intense, I'll grant you, but she plays a woman with lots of challenges. Robert De Niro is superb as Pat Sr., with an OCD personality who has trouble communicating with his problem son.Chris Tucker is Pat's friend from the institution who keeps discharging himself and getting picked up by the police and taken back. He's hilarious. Finally, Jacki Weaver as Pat's mother is delightful - a loving woman trying to reconcile father and son and keep the peace.While some people found the ending formulaic, I loved it. I'm a sucker, so sue me.A warm film, well directed.",8,1,4,4 February 2014
Van Helsing," you can't kill it, it's already dead
","I'm an enormous fan of Hugh Jackman's so I watched this movie. I'm a bit distressed that, besides X-Men, Hugh can't get a blockbuster film deserving of his talent and charisma - which I witnessed first-hand watching him on stage in 'Boy From Oz.' I have to say up front I'm not a particular fan of the horror film genre and Hugh was my only reason to watch this. Having said that, I think this movie didn't know whether to be funny or serious so it didn't make it as either. It probably would have worked better had it been camped up a lot more.The movie looks gorgeous and it certainly had some interesting things in it, but I was bored by it. Hugh kissed the leading lady once. Should have been a lot more of that - maybe I would have been more interested.",6,2,3,2 January 2005
Dreamgirls," One night only
","'Dreamgirls,' written for the screen and directed by Richard Condon, is based on the Broadway hit about a Supremes-like group breaking into the 1960s mainstream. It stars Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy, Danny Glover, Jamie Foxx, Anika Noni Rose, Sharon Leal, and Hinton Battle.I have to admit that I really loved the slickness and glitz of this film, as well as the fabulous music. The book is light, but it does go into the history of black artists trying to break through the 'chitlin circuit' and play Vegas; it also hit on payola.The performances are all excellent, with Eddie Murphy in a showy, Oscar-nominated role of a James Brown-type performer; a stunning debut by Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson as the rejected Effie; she brings down the house with 'And I Am Telling You'; and the beautiful Beyonce Knowles as the lead singer who is managed by Curtis (Jamie Foxx). Foxx gives an interesting performance, playing a brilliant visionary and businessman who on the surface seems like Mr. Nice Guy but who in reality is ruthless. Danny Glover is an old-time manager who doesn't see the future as a changing one for blacks.What I liked the most about 'Dreamgirls' is that Condon lets the musical numbers play out; they're not cut up like an MTV video, although he does provide visual excitement.Highly recommended.",10,0,0,25 March 2010
Being John Malkovich," strange and fascinating
","I had no idea what this film was about when I rented it.  After seeing it, I'm still not sure.  It is definitely the strangest film I have ever seen, possibly the most original as well.  The first hour or so was absolutely hilarious.  Then the film, for me, became darker and stranger.  The performances were all marvelous and interesting.  The concept is thought-provoking - not an easy film to stop thinking about.",7,1,2,1 June 2000
Face_Off," Great action flick with an unusual twist
","I saw Face/Off in the theater and I enjoyed it very much. I say it's a great action flick with an unusual twist because there's some actual acting going on and a storyline. It's got a real sci-fi premise to it, switching faces, which feeds into the fantasy life of those of us who want to call 1-800-FACEOFF and get a Charlize Theron face.Nicholas Cage as a terrorist and John Travolta as a secret agent are both excellent, but when they switch identities - WOW. Travolta really turns it on and does a great job in Cage's persona. Cage is always good, and it's interesting to watch him do the more subdued Travolta persona. And when they're on screen together, it's great.There's plenty of action and violence to keep the viewer entertained. To those who aren't particular fans of the genre, you will still enjoy this old 'Mission: Impossible' premise where they put on those latex masks.",8,18,33,2 October 2005
The Men Who Stare at Goats," bizarre
","A really great cast stars in 'The Men Who Stare at Goats,' a 2009 film directed by Grant Heslov. George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Ewan McGregor, Kevin Spacey -- an exceptional group, with a screenplay by Peter Straughan.An unlucky in love, depressed reporter (Ewan McGregor) goes to join the war in Iraq and meets a special forces agent, Lyn Cassady (Clooney). Cassady tells him a wild story about a psychic division of the military that is trained to do remote viewing and whose mission is to end the violence of war.This is a great premise for a film, but it isn't done particularly well. There seems to have been no decision as to whether it was a comedy or drama. With a focus either way, the elements could have been mixed well, because there are some hilarious moments as well as some very dramatic moments. The problem is, you don't know how to react, so the experience is discomfiting.I don't like animal abuse shown or talked about, even though the peace and love character played by Jeff Bridges as well as Lyn don't like that aspect of their work. I realize there was no real abuse, but what was talked about was pretty gross.The performances are very good, with Clooney saying the most outrageous things with complete commitment and intensity, Bridges doing a character similar to what he played in Big Lebowski, McGregor dazed and confused, and Spacey as an ambitious guy who hopes to use the group toward his own ends. But they're all better than this material.Could have been much better and much stronger.",6,1,3,5 November 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," I know I'm supposed to hate this kind of a movie
","...and often, I do.But I have to say I've enjoyed the Mission: Impossible films - first, the music and whole setup of the secretary disavowing etc. brings me back to my days watching the series.Secondly, these films are nonstop action with no let up.Third, you can pack your troubles away and just be entertained.What I hate is the fact that this is all Hollywood can do now - these CGI blockbusters with explosions, car chases, bungee jumps and the like - while it's left to independent filmmakers to give us stories with real people, real relationships, and real drama.After a review of the IMF missions, the IMF is disbanded and absorbed into the CIA. Ethan Hunt goes rogue to stop a shadow syndicate from its path of destruction, and gets help from his old team: Willam Brandt, Benji Dunn, and Luther Stickell (Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames).He has to second-guess everything his nemesis, Solomon Lane, (Sean Harris) will do, asking himself, did he mean me to find this, am I supposed to react this way...in order to beat Lane at his own game. In the mix is a double agent (Rebecca Ferguson) who, while trying to help Hunt, is answering to the syndicate.This is a perfect type of film for Tom Cruise. I've never thought much of his acting and have always preferred him in an action setting or playing someone like a hit man that requires him to be cold and calculating. The IMF team was great, with Simon Pegg in the showiest role, and Sean Harris as Lane was one of the most frightening characters with the deadest eyes I've ever seen.Best for me was seeing the Vienna Staatsoper again during a performance of 'Turandot' - the scenes there were particularly exciting, the music was beautiful, and it was great to see the opera house again. This film is very well made, suspenseful, and exciting. Highly recommended.",8,0,1,17 October 2016
Collateral," film noir directed by Michael Mann
","'Collateral' is a very exciting noir starring Tom Cruise with either his new chin or his new nose, and Jamie Foxx. Foxx plays an ambitious, likable cab driver, Max, who picks up a hit-man named Vincent (Cruise) as a fare. He and his taxi are taken hostage as the hit-man drives from place to place killing Federal witnesses for a drug lord named Felix (Javier Bardem).The film is loaded with action and suspense. Cruise is perfect in the role of the hit-man. I have never really 'bought' his acting. It always seems very external to me. It works well for this role because the killer is a cold man who's just doing a job.Jamie Foxx isn't the world's greatest actor, but he holds his own as a cabdriver who refers to 'the sociopath in my backseat' at one point.I went along with everything in the film until the very end. I don't understand why Max and Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) didn't just stop the elevator between floors and sound the elevator alarm. Of course, if they had, we wouldn't have been treated to some very suspenseful moments, but I admit it bothered me.Otherwise an excellent film.",8,2,3,6 June 2011
Dark City," Where the sun don't shine
","'Dark City' is a brilliant, imaginative sci-fi film starring Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connelly, Kiefer Sutherland and William Hurt, who live in a nightmarish world, a city that is always dark.Alien beings, who resemble the Superbowl '1984' Apple commercial, have taken over the city and robbed its residents of their memories. They've then mixed the memories up and injected people with memories that aren't theirs, all by way of experiment in an attempt to discover the human soul, hoping somehow the important emotions will attach to these past experiences and people. One man (Sewall) fights off scientist Sutherland as he's about to give the injection, and now everyone is after him. The beings are able to pass a hand over the residents' faces when they want everyone to sleep, and during the sleep time, they rebuild the city to their own requirements.With shades of Fritz Lang's Metropolis, 'Dark City' is a visually stunning film, from the sight of Jennifer Connelly in a brightly colored gown singing in a club, to skyscrapers creeping up to the sky, to the million stars populating the universe, to the huge clock showing midnight. You are drawn into this world and compelled to stay in it as Sewall tries to make some sense of who and what he is.Awesome, thoroughly captivating, thrilling - and for some reason underrated. Don't miss it.",9,1,3,13 June 2006
The Amazing Spider-Man," lots of hate for this
","I admit I'm not familiar with the story of Spider-Man or the Spider-Man genre. Part of Spider-Man 3 filmed here, and it is amazing how many hundreds and hundreds of people are involved in filming a scene, and we did see how car crashes were accomplished.That aside, I wasn't aware that there were two Spider-Man franchises, Spider-Man and the Amazing Spider-Man. It seems that The Amazing Spider-Man is loathed by people on this board.Andrew Garfield stars here as Peter Parker. He's a quiet kid, not a nerd, just a shy kid with a crush on Gwen (Emma Stone), but one who goes about his business. His aunt and uncle are played by Sally Field and Martin Sheen, both excellent. Peter's father (Campbell Scott) and mother leave the boy with the relatives while they disappear. We don't really know what happened to them, despite a newspaper story that says they were killed in a plane crash.Peter is remarkably intelligent and, after finding his father's old research notes, meets his father's ex-partner, Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). While nosing around Dr. Connors' lab, Peter becomes Spider-Man when he's bitten by a spider and turns his powers to vigilantism. While experimenting on himself, Dr. Connors goes a bit overboard and turns into a supermutant Lizard. He starts terrorizing New York. It's only a matter of time before Spider-Man and Connors meet.I guess one franchise, comic books, and a Broadway show aren't enough for Spideyd -- there has to be a second franchise as well. The effects are fantastic, as one would expect, and the cast is good. Besides those mentioned above, Dennis Leary is on hand as the police chief and Gwen's father.For what it was, it was entertaining. I'd be interested to see some of the Spider-Man franchise to compare the two.",7,1,4,16 April 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," AIDS in the '80s
","If you watched your friends die of AIDS in the '80s, you will have an emotional connection to Dallas Buyers Club, which is the true story of the rebellious Ron Woodroof.Matthew McConaughey plays Woodroof, an electrician, homophobe, womanizer, and rodeo rider, who is diagnosed with AIDS in 1986 and given a month to live. At the time, the only drug available was AZT, which did not help Ron. He then starts seeking other treatment and ultimately forms The Dallas Buyers Club, smuggling non-FDA approved drugs from everywhere he could and distributing them to other AIDS sufferers all over the world. Woodroof himself lived until 1992.Part of Woodroof's realization that we're all human and helping AIDS patients came from his strong friendship with Rayon (Jared Leto), a transgender also diagnosed with AIDS. He is also befriended by a compassionate doctor (Jennifer Garner) who doesn't believe that AZT is the answer for AIDS and is interested in other drug protocols.I actually have never believed, and don't believe now, that pharmaceutical companies are interested in a cure for AIDS -- maybe an AIDS vaccine -- but there is too much money in stopping the progression. Also, let's face it, AIDS has become big business, with the growth of organizations to serve the HIV/AIDS communities as well as foundations dedicated to research.Consequently, nothing about this film and the behavior of the FDA surprised me, and I have to agree with what was said by a judge in the film - terminally ill people should be able to try anything they want if they believe it might help them.My big problem with the movie is that I believe Woodroff was bisexual, and I don't understand why he isn't in the film. It seems to me to be a cowardly move.The performances are exceptional -- but then, both McConaughey and Leto have been given exceptional roles that are also sympathetic. Sometimes it's hard to separate all of that from performance. When A Time to Kill was released, I transcribed an interview with Matthew McConaughey. Back then, he had a dog named Miss Hud and asked his agent if he could meet Paul Newman. Suddenly he started making fluff and taking his shirt off. But the talent exhibited in this movie was always there, as was the commitment -- along the way he got lost in the money, I guess. This had to be a role close to his heart -- he is from Texas and has probably met men like Woodroof. He does a beautiful job.As Rayon, Jared Leto is magnificent, totally believable, giving a poignant, warm performance. He's long been a versatile human being, and this is a wonderful achievement.If you didn't live through this period, this film will perhaps not have the effect on you that it will have on others. The death sentence, the distancing of friends, the refusal of some hospital workers to touch you (as happened to a friend of mine) -- men too young to die, at a time when nothing could be done for them. If people became angry with the FDA, it was for good reason, though they did rush things along. Part of it was the political pressure exerted by gays and good for them.Today, thanks to people like Ron Woodroof, it's possible to live with this disease. For the thousands and thousands who died, they just contracted the disease a little too early.Despite some flaws, this is a thought-provoking film about a miserable time.",8,1,1,28 February 2014
Now You See Me," Las Vegas Turnabout
","'Now You See Me' (2013) is a tremendously fun film starring Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine.Four magicians (Eisenberg, Harrelson, Fisher, and Franco) are invited to an address. Inside, they encounter a few tricks. A year later, these four have become The Four Horsemen and are doing a show in Las Vegas. They end the first performance that we see with a bank robbery that doesn't look like an illusion.The FBI gets right on it and sends in an agent, Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) and Interpol sends one as well, Melanie Laurent (Alma Dray). Rhodes is arrogant and thinks figuring out how these four did it is going to be easy, but it isn't, even with the help of a big-time illusionist exposer (Freeman). Of course, that robbery isn't going to be their last as the agents become more and more frustrated.Be ready for the twists and turns, distractions, and sleight of hand. Nothing is as it seems.Highly entertaining film, with good performances from the young cast, working alongside two major pros, Caine and Freeman. I know the film is preposterous but so are a lot of plots. When a film is well done, I say just relax and go along with it. I'm always amazed at how people review a film like this as if it's Citizen Kane. My advice: If you want reality, don't watch movies.",8,1,2,9 June 2014
Gandhi," A great man gets the great bio he deserves
","Ben Kingsley is 'Gandhi' in Richard Attenborough's masterpiece of 1982, a sweeping, meticulously constructed story of one of the greatest men of the last - or any - century. The film begins with Gandhi, a young attorney called to work in South Africa, ordered to move to third class despite his ticket, because he is Indian. He refuses and is thrown off the train. Thus began Gandhi's life of sacrifice and service to his cause - to get India its independence from England, but to do so without violence. He points out, rightly, that there are many more Indians than British in India. With a little organization, independence will be theirs.Unfortunately for Gandhi, human nature being what it is, India no sooner wins its independence than its citizens turn around and start killing one another. How devastating that must of been for a man who devoted his life to the cause of freedom. He responds nonviolently, ov course, by fasting until the conflagration stops. He was such a treasure to the people that fear of his death could make them stop fighting.Richard Attenborough filmed in India and assembled a splendid cast that includes: John Gielgud, Trevor Howard, Candace Bergen, Edward Fox, John Mills, Martin Sheen, Athol Fugard, Nigel Hawthorne, even then newcomer Daniel Day-Lewis in a small role.Writer John Briley fashioned a magnificent script and probably worked through tons of material in order to do it.Now we come to Ben Kingsley. When Kingsley filmed this role, he was interviewed by Jack Kroll of Newsweek, and I transcribed the entire interview. It was fascinating to hear this man speak so intelligently and analytically about Gandhi, about religion, and about the process of acting. But of course, Kingsley doesn't 'act' Gandhi. He is Gandhi. I am unclear about the newsreel footage, whether it was a 'Zelig' type composite or not - I suspect the footage is real and of the actual Gandhi. Frankly, it's hard to tell. It's not so much Kingsley's physical appearance - a thin man shaves his head, darkens his skin, and puts on Gandhi garb - you've got Gandhi. It's in the way Kingsley walks, his mannerisms, the way he sits, smiles, and speaks, that gives us a full characterization.The eight Oscars won by this film were richly deserved. Someone on the message board asked if this is a true story, reminding me of 'Thirteen Days,' when one of the reviewers on this site thought that Kenny O'Donnell, JFK's top aide, was fictional. The level of education in this country is extremely sad. Mahatma Gandhi is the pioneer of resistance to tyranny through mass civil disobedience, copied by leaders all over the world. If you're not learning about him in school -there's a problem.Great, great film that enlightens and inspires.",10,2,3,2 November 2009
Ocean's Eleven," Just great
","George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Shaobo Qin, Miguel Perez, and Livingston Dell make up 'Ocean's Eleven,' a 2001 film directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film also stars Andy Garcia and Julia Roberts. This is a remake of the rat pack 'Ocean's Eleven,' which I've never seen so I can't make comparisons. I suspect that this version has more emphasis on plot and the older one has more emphasis on the pack.The mastermind of a plot to rob Las Vegas' Bellaggio Hotel vault of $160 million is Danny Ocean, a very recent ex-con who had lots of time on his hands in prison to plan it. With the help of his buddy, Rusty Ryan (Pitt) he recruits 9 people who specialize in a particular expertise to carry out the elaborate heist. Problems come in when Ocean, obsessed with his ex-wife (Roberts), approaches her, to the annoyance of her present boyfriend, the owner of the hotel, Terry Benedict (Garcia). He 'makes' Danny by sending out a bulletin with Danny's photo to the hotel staff, which puts him out of his own plot at the insistence of Rusty. But Danny isn't one to exit easily, in either marriage or robberies.This is a fast-paced, tension-filled, exciting movie that's highly entertaining. The plot is completely improbable so you have to take it for what it is - fantastic fun. And you never know whether something is going wrong or if it's part of the plan. The chemistry between the actors, particularly Clooney and Pitt, is great, and there is some wonderful acting. Clooney is solid as Ocean, a passionate man of quiet determination; Damon is terrific as an insecure participant; Don Cheadle, sporting a Cockney accent, is hilarious as an explosives expert; Elliot Gould is outrageous as their financial backer; Carl Reiner is excellent as an older con man who can do accents. Just as they all contribute their different talents to the heist, they do so in this movie. This includes the acting in the smaller roles played by Bernie Mac et al - everyone is perfect. Andy Garcia is fabulous as Benedict - both elegant and scary, he whispers instead of shouts and stays in control for the most part. Megastar Roberts is wasted - she doesn't have much to do.Any actress could have done the role, but I guess the producers wanted an all-star cast.Highly recommended for blockbuster entertainment value and star power. Just don't look for it to be realistic.",8,43,48,28 January 2007
Jackie," what is the problem?
","I'm surprised to see so many bad reviews of this film on IMDb. I would be interested to know how many of them came from people who are too young to remember the Kennedy assassination or much about Mrs. Kennedy.Okay, several people were angry that John-John in the movie didn't salute the casket.One review referred to the story as 'horrible and morbid.' Guess what - it is.One review said Jackie was a 'housewife.' I won't dignify that with a response.Natalie Portman was criticized for doing a 'cringe-worthy' imitation. Her voice and accent were found hilarious.And it was called 'boring' over and over again.I understand that to each his own, and I respect that. I'm just surprised. I first of all did not find this film at all boring. I found it emotional, compelling, and interesting - and despite what someone said here, I did find out things I never knew.I thought Natalie Portman did a brilliant job and, while the role didn't offer as much as Viola Davis' did in Fences, I would not have been upset to see her win another Oscar. There was nothing wrong with her accent, that's how Mrs. Kennedy talked. If you don't believe me, go to youtube and listen to the tapes.The film focused on Jackie after the assassination, but it was shown, as were earlier times, such as her televised tour of the White House. I thought the film mixed with the actual footage was excellent. The clothes were perfection. Like others, I did not care for the music and what I really did not care for was the music at the end.The rest of the cast did an admirable job - John Hurt, Greta Gerwig, and Billy Crudup. I was disappointed in Peter Sarsgaard, but I think he was trying to convey Bobby's shock and grief. He's a good actor normally but not very successful here.I found this a poignant film and a stunning portrait of Jackie Kennedy and what she suffered as a result of the assassination.",9,66,79,10 March 2017
The Usual Suspects," The greatest trick the devil ever pulled...
","1995's beautifully structured 'The Usual Suspects' is really a very simple story. One of only two survivors of a ship explosion (Kevin Spacey) tells a story to the police detective (Chazz Palminteri) in charge of the case about how five career criminals - the 'usual suspects' - met in a lineup and wound up working for the man whose very name strikes terror into the hearts of men - Keyser Soze.As a result, two names were on everybody's lips for some months to come: Kevin Spacey and Keyser Soze.With a crackerjack script by Christopher Quarrie, great direction by Bryan Singer and terrific performances, The Usual Suspects couldn't miss. And it doesn't. Thirteen years later, I remember it as vividly as the day I saw it. I just saw it again, and it's as good as ever.Its other stars are the handsome Gabriel Byrne as Keaton, a bad cop who at one point faked his death to avoid criminal charges; and Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Toro, still a distance from stardom, Kevin Pollak, and Giancarlo Esposito as Kobayashi, Keyser Soze's persuasive assistant.As a scared, not very bright gimpy man, Kevin Spacey is a knockout and well-deserving of his Oscar, his Golden Globe, his SAG Award, his New York Film Critics Award and all his other honors. The writer, Christopher McQuarrie, justly won the Oscar and several other awards. The film and director Singer probably deserved more awards than they received, but it doesn't matter. The Usual Suspects is a modern classic.The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn't exist...and then he's gone.",10,5,7,14 July 2008
The Duchess," Exquisite Keira, exquisitely filmed
","'The Duchess' from 2008 is the sumptuously-told story of Georgiana Spencer, Duchess of Devonshire, a direct descendant of Princess Diana.Georgiana (Knightley) becomes the wife of the Duke (Ralph Fiennes) in 1774. It's an arranged marriage, and the Duke is adamant about the fact that he wants a male heir. Beautiful and vivacious, Georgiana is beloved by society though unhappy in her marriage. The sex makes her uncomfortable, mainly because her husband isn't big on communication. Her mother (Charlotte Rampling) assures her that once the heir is born, the sex will be less.Georgiana, however, keeps giving birth to girls, and the Duke and Duchess even take in Charlotte, the Duke's illegitimate daughter, after her mother dies. Georgiana loves her as if she is her own daughter. When Lady Bess (Hayley Atwell) enters the scene, Georgiana is thrilled to have a friend and confidante, until her husband sleeps with Bess and the three are forced to live together. Georgiana then falls madly in love with Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper) and learns that what's good for the goose isn't so good for the gander, especially when the goose has all the power.Beautiful looking film, with good acting from a top cast, but it moves slowly. One never tires, however, of looking at Knightley in a series of gowns and wigs, ravishing in every scene. The film shows the sad state of women in those times - arranged marriages, blamed if they can't have a boy, forced to tolerate their husbands' affairs, and without power.Georgiana was a woman who was outspoken politically and drew a lot of attention. It is easy to see why she would find her marriage so constraining. While it may have been, she makes the best of it and makes peace with her circumstances. She emerges in the film, thanks to Knightley, as a strong, adaptable, and forgiving woman.It's a lovely story, but it could have moved along a bit faster. If you like costume dramas, you will adore this.",6,2,2,6 June 2017
Yesterday," what if no one remembered the Beatles?
","This is a cute and harmless film, courtesy of Danny Boyle.The story concerns an aspiring musician, Jack Malik (Hamish Patel) who is discouraged about his lack of career and decides to quit. As he's on his way home, there's a worldwide blackout for something like 12 seconds. Danny plows into a bus and winds up in the hospital.He soon realizes that the blackout wiped out a few parts of our culture - cigarettes, Coca Cola, and the Beatles. Jack seems to be the only person in the world who remembers the Fab Four. He starts singing Beatles songs as his own creations and becomes an international star.The story is about what we all have in common and what happens if it's taken away - we lose that little piece that keeps us linked. It's also about a nightmare suffered by famous actors, musicians, artists, and writers - what happens when people realize I'm a fake? Many famous people, when their work is appreciated, feel like frauds.In Jack's case, of course, he is one. As he gets ready for his first album, all the people and success start to get to him. And it's causing him to lose his girlfriend (Lily James).I think another point here is that if the Beatles hadn't existed, we would have had to invent them. Their contribution to our world and our music is incredible. This is a fun film; don't look for Citizen Kane.",7,1,2,29 July 2019
Flashdance," One look at that collarless t-shirt, and you're back in the '80s
","'Flashdance' is an iconic 1980s film, memorable for its terrific music, the collarless t-shirt and sweatshirt, and some fabulous dancing. It also launched the career of beautiful Jennifer Beals.The interesting thing about 'Flashdance' is that there's really not much to it at all. It's a bare-bones story about a Pennsylvania welder (Beals) by day, men's club dancer at night - the dances are sexy and creative performances without nudity, money being thrown at you, etc. The boss of her day job (Michael Nouri) sees her dance and falls for her. She wants to audition for the Philadelphia Dance Repertory Company but she has no real training, she's just naturally gifted. She's encouraged by an elderly friend (Lilla Skala).The reality is it plays like a bunch of music videos. The photography relies heavily on the use of shadows and silhouettes during the dancing, which is quite effective.The acting is so-so; Michael Nouri is fine, but he doesn't have much to do. Cynthia Rhoades, a fabulous dancer who retired after marriage, is pretty and credible as a friend. Beals, who put her career on hold to finish college, is sweet; her acting improved over time. None of the characters are particularly well developed - it's all dialogue in between the music.Nevertheless, 'Flashdance' is an exuberant film that appeals to the youth in all of us, that 'take your passion and make it happen' mentality, with all that music making you want to get up and dance. There were three different dance/acrobatic doubles used for Beals. I can remember it was a semi-scandal when the woman who did most of the dancing was revealed; the studio kept it quiet and didn't credit the dancers.A light, fun film that gave the '80s some great music and fun fashion.",6,1,3,14 June 2009

Gone with the Wind," A real tribute to the old Hollywood that is, like the old south, gone with the wind
","'Gone With the Wind' is such a tremendous achievement in cinema, that, after 66 years, it still deserves to be honored and cherished.David O. Selznick had a very clear vision of what he wanted for this film. He was laughed at, he had to close down filming at one point - but he never gave up on it. His mania regarding the film is portrayed in a play, 'Moonlight and Magnolias,' a comedy in which Selznick locks Victor Fleming and Ben Hecht in his office until they can come up with a shooting script. It's slapsticky, it's fluff, it takes historical liberties, but the underpinnings of the play are real.This is one movie where it is worthwhile to see all the documentary footage available and then watch it again to appreciate the artistry that went into the backdrops, painting in the ceilings, the epic scenes, all done by master craftsmen without the aid of computers.There's no point in commenting on the story or the performances. 'Gone With the Wind' is a reminder of what an artistic vision, loving care to detail, a great story, and a great cast can achieve that's lasting.",10,1,4,17 September 2005
No Country for Old Men," The Coen Brothers strike again
","Joel and Ethan Coen know how to tell a story -- sometimes its meaning is obscure, sometimes it's in your face, but it's always fascinating.In the obscure category is 'No Country for Old Men,' from 2007, starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, and Barry Corbin.What I'm going to write next will mystify many. In a funny way, this film reminded me of Psycho. Here's why - in Psycho, we're led to believe that it's a story about a woman who steals money from her employer. Then she stops at the Bates Motel, and the story changes.Same deal here. This starts off as a story of a man who steals money he finds at a drug deal gone wrong, and we believe we're watching him trying to escape the man chasing him. Turns out the movie isn't really about that.In Texas in 1980, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the scene of a drug deal gone terribly wrong - the ground is peppered with dead bodies. Also laying around unattended is 2 million dollars, which Moss takes.As a result, a man named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is after him. Chigurh kills just about anybody who crosses his path. Moss is on the run, and Chigurh is close behind every step of the way.The sheriff, Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), has become discouraged by the evil in the world and his helplessness in the face of it. Nevertheless, he tries to beat Chigurh to Moss, all the while realizing the job has just about burned him out. It is, in fact, no country for old men.The film is symbolic of evil in human form (Chigurh) coming up against a decent man (Moss) and how it brings about his ruin. Moss' ego and arrogance make him think he can overcome Chigurh's pure evil. His innate goodness compels him to return with water for the one dying drug dealer at the scene, putting Chigurh on his trail when he finds his truck. Temptation, as in the Garden of Eden, can lead to ruin.All the men involved in the story -- Chigurh, Moss, Bell, and an old man whom Bell visits, Ellis - are all fatalists. Moral weakness allows the gods to wreak havoc. Llewellyn brings his fate on himself, and the fate can't be stopped. And so much that happens seems to happen by chance, as the result of a coin toss -- for someone like Bell, looking for meaning, there is no meaning to be found.The Coen Brothers take the western genre and turn it on its boots - we don't witness some of the deaths, and we don't witness the classic good versus evil fight. With Sheriff Bell's retirement, it seems that we are to conclude that evil wins. But the Coen Brothers leave us with hope, as long as we don't depend on mankind for it. Like Bell's dream about his father going ahead and starting a fire for him, the hope is outside of ourselves and our world. As we've seen in court cases, there is no getting of justice in this world. At the end of his dream, Bell says, 'I woke up,' as we all must.A remarkable film by remarkable filmmakers, demanding multiple viewings.",10,5,8,16 December 2013
Mamma Mia!," Upbeat, enjoyable, and fun
","With just a bare bones plot, 2008's Mamma Mia manages to light up the screen, thanks to a great cast, great energy, great music, and great scenery. The Abba musical has been running on Broadway and touring for years.Meryl Streep plays Donna Sheridan, the owner of a hotel on a Greek Island. She's preparing for her 20-year-old daughter Sophie's (Amanda Seyfried) wedding. Unbeknownst to her, her daughter has invited the three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgård), one of whom could be her father, to her wedding, hoping to figure out which one it is and have him walk her down the aisle. When Donna sees them, it rocks her world.The stellar cast also includes Christine Baranski and Julie Walters as Donna's best friends, who sang with her back in the day.My only problems with this film were - first, it's been a hit show for so long that the ages of the women no longer work unless you state upfront that it takes place in 1998 or thereabouts, as the women are supposed to be 50 year-old ex-hippies, placing them and their bell-bottoms in the '60s and early '70s, not the late '70s and '80s.My second problem, which I'm sure many people have commented on, is the godawful singing of Pierce Brosnan. Surely they could have done some mixing in the sound studio instead of inflicting that on a paying audience.Other than that, wonderful entertainment.",7,0,2,12 February 2009
Batman Begins," Dark, brooding, expensive, and excellent
","First off, I'll say that I saw Michael Keaton and George Clooney as Batman, and I remember the TV show. In reading some of the reviews posted here, I realize that I missed a lot of Batman over the years. Apparently this franchise went way wrong (uh, did it start with the Clooney version?), and people were nervous about seeing this one.All I know about the Batman cartoon is that his parents were killed leaving the movies after having seen 'The Mark of Zorro.' Not a Warner Brothers movie, so you can forget that.This film purports to tell the story of how Bruce Wayne became Batman. I'm not sure how much it sticks to the cartoon Batman, but it's terrific just the same. Bruce (Christian Bale) struggles with his anger and bitterness over the death of his parents. He becomes involved with the League of Shadows, a group with a very extreme mission, where he learns a lot of survival techniques. Wayne finally settles on trying to do some good for the broken down, crime-ridden, mob-infested Gotham -especially when he learns that the League of Shadows plans to annihilate it.No expense was spared either for the cast or the effects, and there are some amazing ones. The casting is inspired: the handsome Bale is a perfect Bruce/Batman, who manages to hold his emotions inside; Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler - fabulous casting, and one really sees the bond beween Alfred and Bruce; the brilliant Tom Wilkinson as the evil Carmine Falcone; Liam Neeson as an instructor in the League of Shadows; Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, who works for Wayne's company, which is in danger of being stolen from Bruce. The only off-note for me was the casting of Katie Holmes as an assistant district attorney. She came off like a high school student. Age-wise, as a childhood friend of Wayne's, she's in the right age range, but Holmes seems much younger than her years.This is a dark, brooding film that combines the effects with human drama. Really a great film.",10,1,1,1 May 2010
Liar Liar," For Jim Carrey fans
","Jim Carrey is a super-talented comedian with a handsome, elastic face that by rights should be sagging around his knees, given the way he uses it, and he has more energy than any 20 people put together.I'm a big admirer of him as a talent and as a human being.That being said, the 1997 'Liar, Liar' is Jim Carrey all the way. He plays a busy, divorced lawyer who has the best of intentions regarding his five-year-old son Max but often winds up disappointing him. He also often takes the easy way out of situations by lying, usually the little white ones. On his son's birthday, he fails to appear at the party because he's having sex with an attorney (Amanda Donohue) who can help him become partner; he lies, obviously, about why he's not there. His son wishes that his father could just not lie for one day. He gets his wish.The premise is very funny, because I think most of us are not aware of the little platitudes we use so that we don't insult someone, hurt their feelings, or ruin our careers by stating what we really think of someone in power. In the situation of the Carrey character, he has to go into court to defend an adulterous wife (Jennifer Tilly) with a prenup that cuts her out if she ever cheated and claim she never committed adultery. Given his son's wish, he's finding the circumstances impossible.The story is nothing new, but Carrey's take on it is unique to him as he throws himself on the floor, writhes, sputters, makes noises with his throat, screws up his face - all as he's trying not to lie.The thing about Carrey is, you have to be in the mood for his specialized, way over the top humor. If you aren't, you need to skip this movie.A lot of fun for Carrey fans.",6,0,1,31 March 2009
To Rome With Love," some good moments
","I've said it before and I'll say it again - you can't churn out movies the way Woody Allen does and not have a few clinkers along the way. To Rome with Love is not a masterpiece, but it has some good scenes.Set in beautiful, breathtaking Rome, the film tells four stories: A retired opera director (Allen) visiting his daughter and her new fiancée discovers the boy's father can sing like Caruso; a prostitute (Penelope Cruz) is mistaken for a man's wife by his family; the man's wife is quite naive, ends up on a film studio and is taken to the apartment of one of her favorite actors; a man (Alec Baldwin) returns to the place of his youth and serves as the conscience/adviser to a young man (Jesse Eisenberg) about to fall for his girlfriend's friend (Ellen Page). And a director (Roberto Benigni) becomes an overnight celebrity and is hounded everywhere he goes.Some of these worked better than others. I'm partial to the opera singer story - Allen and Judy Davis play Jerry and Phyllis, the parents of Hayley (Allison Pitt), and her future father-in-law, Giancarlo, is portrayed by opera star Fabio Armiliato. Giancarlo's voice is magnificent, but only when he's in a shower, so Allen comes out of retirement (which he is dying to do) and stages a Pagliacci with Canio in a portable, decorated shower.My second favorite is the newlyweds, featuring Alessandro Tiberi as Antonio, Penelope Cruz as Anna, and Alessandra Mastronadi as Milly. This is the most 'Italian' part of the film and perhaps the most successful. Milly leaves the hotel, becomes terribly lost, and loses her cell phone. While she's wandering around, Anna (Cruz) enters Antonio and Milly's hotel room, mistaking it for the room she was to go to, and starts trying to kiss Antonio on the bed, just as Antonio's relatives arrive. His uncle mistakes her for Milly, and she goes along with it.Milly, meanwhile, finds herself at a movie studio and meets her favorite actor, who wants to seduce her. Everyone winds up at the same restaurant together.I didn't find the acting all that great, particularly in the beginning; it seemed very artificial, though later, I didn't find that as much. I frankly found the Jesse Eisenberg-Ellen Page story a little annoying, as I did the Robert Begnini one. By the way, Penelope Cruz in a tight-fitting, short red dress was drop dead gorgeous.All in all, worth seeing. I think Allen always has something to offer and even at his age is trying new techniques and new cities.",6,2,2,28 May 2014
Non-Stop," not great
","Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore are going 'Non-Stop' in this 2014 film.Neeson plays an alcoholic air marshall who is texted that one person every 20 minutes is going to die unless the terrorist gets $150 million transferred to his account. He begins a frantic search for the texter, and then it is learned that the bank account to receive the money is in his name.In order to emphasize what a total mess Liam Neeson's character is, 9 years were knocked off of his age so that he would look pretty bad for 53 instead of okay for 62.Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o has nothing to do.For me, this wasn't an edge-of-my-seat adventure film, so the plot holes I would normally forgive, I can't. And this one was so full of plot holes, a Swiss cheese would look solid.It's one thing to leave certain questions about the plot up to the audience, but sadly, I don't think that's why the film is confusing and has open questions. I think it was just sloppily written.",6,0,1,11 July 2014
Man on the Moon," unsuccessful and questionable
","Man on the Moon leaves the viewers with two questions.  (1) What possessed anyone to make this movie?  (2) Why did anyone who knew Andy Kaufman care about him?  Andy Kaufman may have been brilliant and eccentric (and other than the Mighty Mouse and Latka, nothing was very funny so the brilliance is questionable), but there's no attempt to explain to an audience what made him tick - and showing what made him tick MIGHT have made an audience care for two seconds.  It's difficult to watch a film when you hate the main character. Carrey is a fantastic actor and certainly capable of going deeper into the character of a complicated man.  The film picked up toward the end but there's never an explanation of why people he totally abused, such as the Taxi cast, were shown seemingly to have loving feelings toward him.",6,1,2,4 June 2000
The Princess Bride," so much fun
","Not much to add to other reviews - a delightful, warm story with some hilarious sections. Rob Reiner had to leave the set while Billy Crystal did his scenes because he became nauseated from laughing so hard. Mandy Patinkin bruised a rib trying to keep from laughing during his scene with Crystal.Robin Wright was a perfect, sweet ingenue just as now she's an amazing President on 'House of Cards' and was everyone's image of the ideal First Lady.The entire cast was great. I loved Peter Falk reading the story to Fred Savage.",10,2,3,6 October 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Sophisticated, beautiful, funny, and bittersweet
","Wes Anderson's stunning Grand Budapest Hotel is a treat for the eyes and years. It's visually gorgeous, as well as being witty, dark, and magnificently acted by a huge cast which includes Ralph Fiennes, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, F. Murray Abraham, Bill Murray, Fisher Stevens, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, and Willem Dafoe.F. Murray Abraham plays the owner of the Grand Budapest, Zero Moustafa, who tells how it came to be his. In order to do that, he has to tell the story of the concierge, M. Gustave (Fiennes), who befriends Zero when he becomes a lobby boy. Gustave inherits a painting, Boy with Apple, from a wealthy older woman (Tilda Swinton) and, in the midst of a family fight for her fortune, takes off with it. Meantime, the world is entering the war.Anderson has created an amazing universe that is like watching an MGM film with a foreign story back in the '30s, such as Idiot's Delight. It goes back to the days of exquisite service, enormous wealth and privilege, and idyllic beauty.It's also hilariously funny, with Fiennes popping off the one liners and the young Zero (Tony Revolon) keeping a serious face throughout. Many of the scenes, including the ones in the prison, are priceless.There's a dark and poignant undertone to The Grand Budapest Hotel because for all its wild characters and antics, it portrays a way of life that is no more.Everyone is excellent, but Fiennes has the largest role and is fabulous -- elegant, funny, flirtatious, and demonstrating masterful timing. It's really a new side to him -- considering that I saw him do Hamlet on Broadway.Terrific, don't miss it.",9,3,6,17 May 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," your mission, should you decide to accept....
","Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol,' a 2011 film also starring Jeremy Renner, Paula Patton, Michael Nyqvist, Josh Holloway, and Lea Sydoux.The terrorist Kurt Hendricks (Nyqvist), who goes by the name of Cobalt, hires Sabine Moreau (Sydoux), a killer, to steal Russian launch codes in Budapest. He, meanwhile, is going to get rid of his records at the Kremlin.Hunt's assignment is to get Hendricks' identity at the Kremlin, but the Kremlin is bombed by Hendricks before Hunt and his team can complete their mission. The IMF is held responsible for the bombing and the IMF is shut down (Ghost protocol).Ethan's team then try to clear the IMF name and keep Hendricks from starting a nuclear war.Terrific, exciting adventure film with Cruise in top form and surrounded by an effective cast that includes the beautiful Patton. I admit I'm not a huge fan of Cruise's - I find him a handsome but external actor. He does his best work in this kind of film which relies on his presence and athleticism, as well as a certain detachment as the head of a team. Another film that showcased him well was 'Collateral,' where he played a cold-blooded hit man.Non-stop action will keep you absorbed. This is an excellent franchise that continues to deliver, and I love the fact that they use so many of the basic tools of the TV show - the recording, the language, the self-destruct, the logo, and elements of the music.Nail-biting, edge of your seat stuff.",8,1,2,10 May 2012
Revolutionary Road," Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans
","Leonard DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star in 'Revolutionary Road,' a 2008 film directed by Sam Mendes. The film also features Kathy Bates and John Givings.It's 1955. Frank and April Wheeler have been married seven years, live in the Connecticut suburb and have two children. Frank works for a company that his father worked for, and he hates his job. April is a stay-at-home mom who wanted to be an actress.While it might look good on the outside, this isn't the life either one envisioned. But April has an idea. They have enough money saved so that they can move to Paris, a city Frank loves. She can get a job as a secretary, which pays very well over there, and Frank can stay at home and decide what he really wants to do with his life. It sounds possible but maybe not practical, though Frank ultimately agrees to it.Frank can't seem to find the right moment to give his notice; and then April discovers that she is pregnant. What now? There are lots of layers in this emotionally resonant, magnificently acted film. It's very much a story of its time for several reasons. The first is that it's obvious that April suffers from very bad depression. Though post-war psychological problems were recognized, actual depression, especially in a woman, probably wasn't given much attention. It was the returning soldiers who had suffered trauma who had the psychiatric focus. If by some means she had been discovered to have clinical depression, the medicine was horrible.The second thing is that it was 1955. The ideas of picking up and moving to Europe with your family and the woman as breadwinner were outrageous back then. Now, not so much.The third reason is that April at least had an artist's mentality and an artist's way of looking at the world. In this world, we have the practical and the artist, as in the O'Neill play Beyond the Horizon, where one brother is a farmer and the other brother is a poet who dreams of going out to sea. The problem is, there's no way to kill those attributes, and if you try, you won't be happy. April shouldn't have been married, shouldn't have been living in the suburbs, and shouldn't have stayed home.Frank is more practical, though he'd like to be different, would like to do something he loves, if only he knew what that was. April thought he was cosmopolitan, adventurous, and that together, they'd be special. The idea that they're not special is something she can't tolerate.This is such a fascinating movie about life's disappointments, punctuated with some humor by Kathy Bates as Mrs. Givings, a loquacious woman, whose son (Michael Shannon) has been institutionalized. When he meets the Wheelers, he has an uncanny way of speaking exactly the truth no one wants to hear. Shannon does a fantastic job in these disturbing scenes.A shattering movie. I like to be entertained in films. I feel like we all have so much to reality to face, why not be able to turn away from it - but a beautifully realized film like this about dysfunction - somehow, I don't mind.",9,0,0,20 September 2014
Foxcatcher," unbelievably awful
","I have a book called 'Flesh and Fantasy' which explains how to win or be nominated for an Oscar. One way is a false nose.Steve Carrell (with a false nose) stars as John Dupont in 'Foxcatcher' from 2014, also starring Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo.'Foxcatcher' is the story of two brothers, 1984 Olympic Gold medalist in Wrestling, Mark Schultz (Tatum) and his brother Dave. Mark is invited by the fabulously wealthy John Dupont to train at Foxcatcher Farms and form a team, with the goal of winning the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. Schultz agrees and is excited for a chance to do something on his own, away from his well-known brother Dave (Ruffalo).Dupont feels that he does not have the respect of his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) and wants the wrestling team to help him gain not only her respect but to boost his ego. Mark becomes increasingly more dependent on his approval.However, all that glitters -- Mark finds himself involved in things that could wreck his training, both physical and psychological. Dupont then has Dave come in as a trainer. The end of the story is tragedy.Well, the whole thing was a tragedy. It was so dull, it was practically done as a documentary - and not a particularly interesting one, I might add. The pacing was sleep-inducing. I blame the director for absolutely everything that went wrong. Steve Carrell probably studied DuPont and gave an accurate portrayal. Given Dupont's psychological problems and lack of self-esteem, Carrell's flat affect, both in his lack of expression and flatlined voice, were correct.The only problem with that is, it's hard to recognize how deeply disturbed he was when everyone around him is acting the same way. Channing Tatum spent the whole film looking like a dumb jock and muttering. The homoerotic part of their relationship is shown, but since Tatum acted no differently than he did in the beginning, it's hard to say if it bothered him or not. He does, however, frost his hair.Mark Ruffalo does the best he can.Obviously from the reviews, people read into it a lot more than was there, and that's good. If everyone had the same opinion, it would be a pretty dull world - almost as dull as this movie.",2,1,4,27 November 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino retells Hollywood, film, and TV revives history like no one can.
","Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was an amazing trip for baby-boomers - taking us back to when television was loaded with westerns and western TV stars, cigarette commercials, big cars, white go-go boots, and names bandied around some of us haven't heard in years. And the shows: Hootnanny, Mannix, the FBI.And it's great to see some Hollywood celebrities -Mama Cass (Rachel Redleaf), Michelle Phillips (Rebecca Rittenhouse), Steve McQueen (Damien Lewis), James Stacy (Timothy Olyphant), Wayne Maunder (Luke Perry), Bruce Lee (Mike Moh), Connie Stevens (Dreama Walker).It was not so great given their fates, but there were some other familiar names too: Jay Sebring, (Emile Hirsch), Abigail Folger (Samantha Robinson), Voytek Frykowski (Costa Ronin), and Squeaky Fromme (Dakota Fanning).Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt star as series actor Rick Dalton and his stunt double, Cliff Booth. Booth isn't living the LA high life - far from it - and does part-time stunt work these days and basically acts as Rick's gofer.Rick lives, as it turns out, on Cielo Drive, right next Sharon Tate (Margo Robbie) and Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha).Tarantino has the Manson story down pat - Manson coming to look for Terry Melcher, Doris Day's son, because a proposed record deal never materialized. Sharon's pregnancy, weekend guests, the visit to El Coyote, even sitting at the right table (I've been there hundreds of times), and it did look like they actually filmed inside.It was also fun to see Musso & Frank's Grill.Rick Dalton, whose career is losing ground due to his alcoholism, makes an appearance on 'Lancer,' directed by Sam Waterston (Nicholas Hammond). Wanamaker, the original George in Virginia Woolf, did indeed do a lot of television directing.Rick's time on Lancer is juxtaposed with Sharon going to see herself in a film, The Wrecking Crew. We see her young, beautiful, and happy.I admit here that I felt the 'Lancer' section was way too long, but part of that could be because I wasn't feeling that well during that time. It did show Rick determined to do a good job. The entire scene represents a wonderful tour de force for DiCaprio.After a nostalgic and sometimes amusing wind-up, Tarantino goes into full Tarantino mode in the last forty minutes or so. Also stay through the credits; the movie doesn't end where you think it does.So Tarantino in a way heals this beloved era and a time in Hollywood where everything was beginning to be in flux - western stars making films in Italy and Spain, the detective show taking the place of westerns, and events in the air that would change Hollywood forever.Pitt and DiCaprio are dynamite together, DiCaprio, drunk, sad, but a man who can still act. Pitt is cool and takes life as it comes.Another standout for me was Damien Lewis as Steve McQueen. The man's amazing.However, the film is loaded with vignettes and memories in the corners of our minds as the song says, that if you're a boomer, you can't not love. It was the summer of love, it was a prelude to a much more somber time. For the non-boomers, there are DiCaprio and Pitt doing what they do best - being movie stars.",9,11,16,9 September 2019
Gone Girl," whoa - what reviews
","I watched this film today and when I came onto IMDb to write a review, I was assaulted by many reviews of one star. I changed the order to prolific authors and found that they really liked it. I'm a prolific author and so did I.A woman (Rosamund Pike) frames her husband (Ben Affleck) for her own murder, even though she's simply disappeared.The first part of the film is the investigation and finding out what really happened from the wife, Amy, herself; the rest of the film covers what happens as a result.Most people hated the ending, which felt ambiguous to some. I thought it was okay.The cast is excellent, with Ben Affleck doing a good job in the lead. Talk about turning your career around. Rosamund Pike is excellent as the treacherous Amy, and Carrie Coon, as Affleck's twin, does a wonderful job. On hand is also Tyler Perry as an attorney, Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's ex-beau Desi, Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit as the police investigating the case, and Sela Ward as Sharon Scheiber.This is another winner for David Fincher, who proves again that his casting is as skillful as his directing.I'm not familiar with the book. I found the story intriguing. As far as plot holes, more often than not, there are plot holes. For a movie like this, I usually just let everything go and get into it so I can enjoy the film. I watch movies for entertainment, not to rip them apart. When they are badly done, I happily trash them. But with a well-done film, I'm pretty forgiving.",8,12,20,30 January 2015
The Number 23," a change of pace for funnyman Carrey
","Jim Carrey has a serious role in 'The Number 23' from 2007. Carrey of course isn't the first comic to take a serious role but this one is way out there.Carrey plays an animal control worker - in other words, a dog-catcher, named Walter Sparrow. It's his birthday, and he goes after a dog that bites him and gets away, and makes him late to pick up his wife, Agatha (Virginia Madsen). While passing the time, she goes into a bookstore and finds a book she thinks he might like.The book is a mystery that has to do with the number 23. Walter becomes very involved with the story. It seems to mirror his own, and he starts to see the number 23 everywhere. He has wild, horrible dreams, and soon is completely obsessed, to the point where he has to track down the author. He believes it to be the man accused of murdering a young woman in the story, so he goes to prison to see him. The man denies that he is the author, and also that he killed the girl.Walter goes to the fleabag hotel where the novel takes place and asks for number 23, and finds himself living the novel. His wife and son can't seem to help him as he veers more and more out of control.I don't remember this film being released, and I didn't read any reviews of it today. I actually thought it was pretty good. Normally this isn't my type of thing as it's pretty much a horror film. But I found it engrossing with some fascinating things that happen along the way. I know what a strong dramatic actor Jim Carrey is from seeing him in 'Doin' Time on Maple Drive,' and he does a great job with the role of the confused, desperate, frightened Walter. Virginia Madsen is very good as his wife.I found this an interesting, offbeat film.",7,0,1,11 February 2013
The Lives of Others," One word: Magnificent
","Before the Berlin Wall came down, the government was very interested in 'The Lives of Others,' a brilliant 2006 German film directed and written by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.The story concerns a dramatist, Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), and his actress-girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). As artists, they are revered by the party. In private, however, their politics are somewhat different, but they're careful to keep them quiet. The Minister of Culture isn't convinced of Dreyman's loyalty - in part because of his own interest in Christa, so he assigns an agent, Weisler (Ulrich Muhe), to spy on them. This entails wiring their apartment for sound, listening in 24/7, and providing reports to the Minister. Weisler becomes drawn into the lives of these two people and their friends, and therein lies the fascinating story.Poignant, occasionally funny, scary, and thought-provoking, 'The Lives of Others' is a fantastic film about the human soul in the face of politics, bureaucracy, fear, and desensitization. The director captures the tension-filled, drab atmosphere of East Berlin. I found the ending especially emotionally powerful.The acting is wonderful. Muhe is great as a colorless puppet of the state, and Gedeck and Koch are excellent as the theatrical couple. The entire film is well cast and well acted.This film won 61 awards internationally and deserved every one. Its best foreign film Oscar came as a big surprise - until people saw the film. Don't miss it.",10,4,5,24 January 2010
The Bourne Legacy," Fantastic acting breathes life into characters
","I'm no expert on action films, so this review will not be as hypercritical or detailed as some others on this site.I loved the Bourne films. 'The Bourne Legacy' seeks to trade in on the Bourne name, without Matt Damon, and without Jason Bourne. This is the fourth installment of the Bourne franchise and evolves around a new main protagonist, Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner). The story continues on from the end of the third Bourne movie, and concerns itself with the result of Jason Bourne's exposure of the Blackbriar program.In this plot, due to the scandal started by Jason Bourne, the government program called Outcome is eliminating their agents and shutting down the program. 'Outcome' seems to be some sort of amalgamation of Treadstone and Blackbriar. However, their agents have had their chromosomes altered, giving them heightened powers of speed, brain, and brawn. This is done by giving them pills. They change the pills given the agents and, one by one, the agents die.Rachel Weisz plays Dr. Marta Shearing, a scientist who manages to escape annihilation when there's a shootout in the lab. Cross helps her escape, and the two of them go on the run as they're both marked for death. But Cross needs his medication, or as he tells her, they won't make it. But Marta doesn't have the pills -- in fact, she's a scientist on a need to know basis. The pills are manufactured and stored in Manila. So that's where they go.If it weren't for the wonderful characterizations developed by Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, this wouldn't be much of a movie. And actually, I found myself concentrating on them rather than the story. Their chemistry is wonderful. The villains were pretty blah -- Stacy Keach and Edward Norton -- both of them a little too straightforward.There was much discussion here on IMDb about the action sequences. I frankly loved the motorcycle chase - to me, it was breathtaking. As I say, I'm no expert.What I most remember about the first Bourne film, which I saw in the theater, was the element of surprise -- the type of thing that makes the audience jump a bit off their seats. There wasn't any of that here. The Bourne Legacy was directed by Tony Gilroy, who has been successful in other ventures and certainly knows the Bourne franchise, having written the past scripts and this one. He's less successful here and one suspects the Bourne franchise is out of steam.If Aaron Cross is going to continue, the stories have to be rethought. Hollywood does this kind of film very well - in this case, the script was a letdown.",7,2,3,21 January 2013
Dog Day Afternoon," The eyes have it
","Sidney Lumet directed the magnificent 'Dog Day Afternoon' in 1975, but the story could be done just as is today and still be fresh. Thus is one mark of a classic. Al Pacino is Sonny, who along with his friend Sal (John Cazale) and another man brazenly walk into a bank and attempt to rob it. Here it's somewhat of a black comedy, because the third man decides he can't go through with it and leaves - but before he does, Sonny gets the car keys from him. We later learn that Sonny, a husband and father, is robbing the bank to get money for his other spouse, Leon (Chris Sarandon), who wants a sex change operation. Sonny is nice to the hostages. He doesn't lock them in the vault because there won't be enough air, he lets them go to the bathroom, he tells them to call home, he gets food brought in - and when one of the women has an opportunity to leave, she doesn't, nor does the lone man.This is first of all one of the world's loudest films that must have used as many extras as 'Cleopatra' did. They line the Brooklyn street outside the bank yelling for Sonny, and later the crowds are joined by the gay community yelling 'Out of the closet and into the street!' The harried police, who are having trouble figuring out this guy, are led by Charles Durning, with James Broderick (Matthew's dad) there for the FBI. It's an incredibly circus atmosphere, with helicopters flying overhead, television cameras, reporters, and police.Through it all there's Sonny and Sal, with Sonny hoping that Sal doesn't start shooting as he tries to figure a way out of the mess he's gotten himself into. Al Pacino gives a tour de force performance as Sonny, a man with an hysterical mother, an hysterical wife, and a lover in Bellevue who wants to get away from him. It felt as if much of the dialogue was improvised; it sounds very natural. Pacino's eyes tell a story, particularly at the very end of the film. When he was young, his eyes dominated his face, and they were mesmerizing.Chris Sarandon gives a terrific performance as Leon. Everyone is good, well directed by Lumet with a hand that gives the entire film authenticity. Look for Carol Kane was one of the hostages and 'The Sopranos' Uncle Junior, Dominic Chianese, in a tiny role as Sonny's father.A must see, and a film that showcases Lumet's great talent and why Al Pacino is one of our greatest actors.",10,1,2,22 April 2011
Amadeus," Beloved of God
","To be born with the love of music and with great ambition and yet have a mediocre talent; to hate passionately one with clearly a heavenly gift - that is the story of Amadeus. Directed by Milos Forman and starring F. Murray Abraham, Tom Hulce, Roy Dotrice, Elizabeth Berridge, Jeffrey Jones and Christine Ebersole, this 1984 film is sumptuously produced and made in Prague, certainly one of the most glorious cities in the world.Amadeus is based on a play by Peter Shaeffer and gets its roots from a Rimsky-Korsakov opera. It is the highly fictionalized story of Wolfgang Mozart and another composer of the time, Salieri, who was jealous of Mozart's talent and vowed to bring him down. In reality, the two men were colleagues, and the story is really a what-if. However, as a friend of mine returning from a concert where Salieri's music was performed said, 'By the way, I can believe Salieri killed Mozart, if this was the best he could come up with.' It certainly would be amazing if other composers alive during that period were not aware of the child prodigy and his prolific compositions. It would be more amazing if they weren't just a little jealous.The story is told by the institutionalized Salieri (Abraham) to a priest, and we see Mozart (Tom Hulce) from his point of view: as an eccentric, lascivious, ill-behaved young man whose behavior belies his great talent. Salieri attempts to ruin Mozart, even using the influence Mozart's own late father had over him by disguising himself in a huge black cloak as Mozart Sr. wore and commissioning Mozart to write a Requiem.The performances are exquisite, and one can really feel Salieri's pain as exhibited brilliantly by F. Murray Abraham. One empathizes with his anger toward, jealousy of and contradictory admiration for Mozart. Mozart himself is depicted as an idiot on whom musical talent was randomly bestowed. Tom Hulce's laugh as Mozart is unforgettable, as is his chasing Constanze, who became his wife, under a piano. As the film goes on, much of this wild behavior grows less, and the audience is permitted to see Mozart the genius, with a million notes in his head, dictating from his sick bed, and soberly conducting his music.The real star of Amadeus is the music, lushly performed, the vocal music ranging from his simple Caro Mio Bene to Abduction from the Seraglio, The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute and the orchestral from symphonies, concertos, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik and, of course, his Requiem.Amadeus is a feast for the eyes and a thrill for the ears. It is a thought-provoking film about genius, mediocrity and immortality.",10,1,2,29 May 2008
Unknown," Good twist to an old plot
","A man (Liam Neeson) is in a horrible accident, and when he recovers, no one knows who he is, including his wife, in 'Unknown,' a 2011 film starring Liam Neeson, January Jones, Diane Kruger, Aiden Quinn, and Frank Langella.We've seen this plot, or a derivation thereof, many times: the man who disappears and everyone denies his existence to the person who accompanied him (So Long at the Fair, Dangerous Crossing), or the man who suddenly isn't who he says he is (The Net). The plot of 'Unknown' is the latter, and Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) attempts to investigate why someone (Aiden Quinn) is now Dr. Martin Harris and with his wife (January Jones). To do this, Harris must first find the taxi driver who saved his life (Kruger). Meanwhile, he desperately tries to reach a professor (Frank Langella) back at his college who can verify his identity.This type of film, when done well, as this one was, moves quickly and has lots of actions in order to cover up the plot holes. There usually are some, but if the film is good, one doesn't mind. I have to say I really enjoyed this film, filmed mostly in and around Berlin. Good performances, very exciting, a couple of dandy car chases, and a neat twist. Highly recommended.",8,36,53,7 July 2011
Gran Torino," A man comes to grips with his past
","It's hard to write about the emotional impact of 2008's 'Gran Torino,' directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. At times, it's so funny, you're crying with laughter, and at other times, so sad that you're crying for a different reason. Whatever it is, it's Clint Eastwood's best performance, and certainly one of his best movies.Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a recent widower and Korean war vet who doesn't have a relationship with either of his two sons. He's a complete bigot and a racist. He has guilt about the people he killed in Korea. The best that can be said about him, at the beginning of the movie anyway, is that he loves his dog. And that seems to be about all he loves - the dog and his magnificent 1972 Gran Torino. One night, he catches someone trying to steal it and, using his trusty big gun, runs the thief off of his property. It's the Hmong boy next door, Thao (Bee Vang), whose cousin is a Hmong gang member and trying to initiate the confused Thao. 'Hmong girls go to college,' his sister Ahney (Sue Lor) explains to Walt. 'Hmong boys go to jail.' Gradually, thanks to Ahney's easy way with him, and the fact that he thinks she's 'all right,' Walt is lured next door for a family gathering. It's awkward at times, but he loves the food. He detests the gang - he keeps them from assaulting Ahney and stops an attack on Thao, earning him the undying gratitude of Hmong neighborhood. When Thao is sent to work for Walt as an act of contrition for trying to steal his car, Walt takes an interest in the boy's future - and he won't have a future if the gang influence isn't stopped.What we learn about Walt - and what Walt learns and teaches - is what 'Gran Torino' is all about. The car, like Walt, is out of place and part of a bygone era in an old neighborhood largely inhabited now by the Hmong people. Yet he and the car belong there.The best moments are between Thao and Walt, especially when Walt teaches Thao to 'man up' - definitely the funniest scenes in the film. A priest (Christopher Carley) promised Walt's late wife that he would get Walt to go to confession. Carley with his baby face and quiet manner, is very well cast, and the scenes between the two men are very good.All the performances are excellent, but Eastwood here has created one of the all-time great characters. It's fascinating to see what he has accomplished since he first came to public attention as a robust, handsome western hunk in 'Rawhide.' He has emerged as a great artist - most of his films are infused with complex characters and profound emotions. Not every performer has the opportunity or ability to grow in his work, but Eastwood was given that opportunity and made the most of it. At 78, he's better than ever.",10,4,11,20 June 2009
K-19: The Widowmaker," good film based on a true story
","'K-19: The Widowmaker' is a true story about the USSR's first nuclear ballistic submarine. On its first voyage, the nuclear reactor malfunctions, and the crew risks their lives attempting to fix it by exposing themselves to dangerous levels of radiation. If the situation can't be repaired, they risk not only a nuclear disaster of epic proportions but a world war.Harrison Ford is the strict Captain Alexei Vostrikov, who puts his crew through endless drills so that they can build camaraderie and a sense of achievement. Unfortunately, the sub is not equipped for any kind of nuclear problem -- they have chemical suits instead of radiation suits (not available until later), and as the second in command (Liam Neeson) says, they might as well be wearing raincoats.This is the most devastating part of the film. The men can only enter the site of the problem for ten minutes at a time, and it's enough to nearly burn them alive. The sub becomes more and more dangerously radioactive, to the point where they will need to abandon ship. The nearby Americans offer to help, but Vostrikov's patriotism and fear that the Americans may learn Soviet secrets causes him to refuse.There are some really excellent moments in this film as well as some fine performances from Ford, Neeson, and the rest of the cast, and it is well directed by Kathryn Bigelow.I see a lot of the reviews deal with accents, so I'll put in my two cents. Yes, it's true, Ford just lost his mid-film and picked it up again later. The rule for actors is that if people are speaking their native language, which naturally these Russians were, no accent is necessary. A good example of this is the film 'The Mortal Storm.' Otherwise, of course, Chekov would be done with accents, French farces would be done with accents, etc., and they aren't. And yes, it's okay to talk about kopecks with an American accent as we understand that they are speaking Russian. You need an accent if you are playing a foreigner speaking English, so accents were not needed here. It didn't bother me, but it was an unnecessary layer.All in all, a good, solid movie, not as good as 'Das Boot' or a couple of other submarine films, but still worth seeing.",7,1,2,6 December 2011
Moulin Rouge!," I don't know what I was expecting
","...but it sure as hell wasn't this! I loved Luhrman's ''Strictly Ballroom' but after seeing 'Moulin Rouge,' the word talent doesn't begin to sum up what this man can do. Absolutely fresh, exciting, colorful, fast, brilliant, fiery, sweet, gorgeous, funny, original - I'm still stunned from the visual impact and the use of the anachronistic music in this film.A total knockout in every way. I recently saw John Leguizamo interviewed. He said that he was scheduled to be in more numbers but - and I'm paraphrasing - Nicole Kidman kept knocking him over or vice versa - he was hilarious.Baz Luhrman pulled some opera elements into this, particularly Traviata - one of the scenes was right out of Traviata, in fact. I'd love to see him do a production of it. It would be phenomenal.The cast was wonderful, with Kidman and McGregor magnificently showcased - beautiful to look at, fine acting, good singing - they made a fantastic couple.I have one itty bitty criticism, but it's not enough to give such an original approach less than a 10. I would have loved some of the musical numbers to have been just a tiny bit slower. I realize today the style is more the fast cuts, but some of it was so beautiful, I would have loved to have lingered on some of the scenes a bit more.A sensational accomplishment. A must see.",10,0,3,24 August 2009
Ex Machina," that's some robot
","Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander star in the 2014 'Ex Machina,' directed and written by Alex Garland.Caleb (Gleeson) is a 26-year-old programmer at an Internet search engine company of Google proportions. He wins a competition which enables him to spend a week at the private retreat of the CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac).The retreat is in a gorgeous setting, but Nathan is a strange one, drinking heavily and keeping Caleb off-balance. Caleb learns that he has been chosen to be part of an experiment with artificial intelligence. The AI is a gorgeous robot, and Caleb is directed to interact with her and give his assessment. As he learns more about her and about Nathan, the situation becomes more and more strange and uncertain.Beautifully photographed and well-made film with some excellent acting. There is nothing new about man versus machine, but 'Ex Machina' deals with human emotions, deception, manipulation, and sexual attraction.Gleeson comes off as the perfect patsy, and the character of Nathan is hateful, a tribute to Isaac's performance. The beautiful Vikander is great as Ava, the robot, hitting the right balance between automaton and human. The finale is fascinating and also tells us something about artificial intelligence, if it ever comes to be. See for yourself.",7,1,3,21 June 2017
The Illusionist," wonderful film
","'The Illusionist' is a wonderful film, partially based on some real-life events and characters. It's easily confused with 'The Prestige' because both concern magicians at the turn of the century, and both films were released in the same year. I admit to liking 'The Prestige' a little more - it was directed with sleight of hand as well as being about it; I did figure out 'The Illusionist,' whereas 'The Prestige' kept me guessing.But both films are really quite different. Edward Norton plays Eisenheim, a magician who never stopped loving his childhood friend, Sophie, a duchess and, of course, of another class. He meets her again; she is in love with him, though she is now engaged to Crown Prince Leopold, who is to succeed his father to the Austrian throne. Leopold is a controlling and powerful man. He sees right away that Eisenheim is dangerous, not to mention scary with his phenomenal illusions. He has a chief inspector (Paul Giamatti) watching him and reporting back to him at all times. When Eisenheim and Sophie are spotted together, Leopold becomes more determined than ever to get rid of Eisenheim.This is a rich, atmospheric film with wonderful performances, particularly from Edward Norton. Paul Giamatti is such a marvelous actor, I wish his role had been a richer one. Jessica Biel makes a beautiful Sophie. I had a couple of problems: one is the use of accents. In their own country, the people would be speaking German, not English with a German accent, so why not use no accents? We certainly know we're in another country in another time - the film was shot in the Czech republic, and it's gorgeous to look at.'The Illusionist' asks us to look at what is illusion and what is reality - or are they both the same thing?",8,0,0,22 June 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," not much to say
","I don't have too much to say about this film, except that it was one of the most beautiful, touching, poignant, and bittersweet films I have ever seen.Benjamin Button lives his life in reverse. Despite this, it's a great life, full of adventure and love and learning. He finds out that no matter what, it's the people who make life so special.The film is beautifully photographed and true to the periods it represents.Brad Pitt is fantastic, and those CGI and makeup techniques for him and the rest of the cast are marvelous. It's a tribute to the film that it's very organic to the cast so we are not aware of makeup and CGI. Cate Blanchett is incredible; she is a dying, old woman in the beginning and gives a tremendous performance.We're born helpless and without life memories, and some of us die that way. In a way, I guess, it doesn't matter if you're born old or die old - it's like Benjamin tells Cate Blanchett in the film, you'd still end up where you are now. The life experience, the people you meet, the wisdom you acquire, all happens -- and it happened to Benjamin at a time when he could really value it. But as he points out: 'For what it's worth: it's never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There's no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it.'",10,0,1,28 September 2013
Pawn Sacrifice," brilliant but disturbed
","Well, the reviewer before me absolutely trashed this film for its dramatic license, so now I don't know what to say.This is the highly fictionalized story of Bobby Fischer, a chess fanatic and genius who rose to the very top of his field. He was part of a Russia vs. U.S. superiority struggle when he played Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber), the world champion back then, in the '70s. It's unlikely he understood that; he didn't have a broad or worldly focus. The chess was all he cared about, that and money.Biopics sometimes take a lot of liberties. Characters are made up, time is shortened, incidents are moved around, elements are put in for dramatic emphasis. That's why you can't take a biographical film as factual. It's better if you become interested in the person and read about him, as I did about Fischer, though I remember him.Toby Maguire does a fantastic job as Fischer. Yes, Fischer was tall and Maguire is short. Frankly I wasn't made aware of Maguire's height while watching the film.I believe the filmmakers were trying to give us a psychological story -- a complete genius with an IQ of 181 but one who also had mental problems. Lots of so-called geniuses are strange, I suppose, but Fischer was a real study in opposites.He often made unreasonable, last-minute demands, made anti-Semite remarks, and accused the Russians of colluding against him. In the second game of his world championship against Spassky, he didn't show up. Nevertheless, his achievements in chess were remarkable, and many consider him the greatest chess player who ever lived.His later life was a mess; he became reclusive; his passport was revoked and finally, Iceland took him in. By then he was off the wall completely.Edward Zwick directed this film with a lot of zip and made it an intense and absorbing experience, as did the actors. Look at this as the psychological story of a phenomenal talent whose emotional/mental problems interfered with his life and career. Don't take it as the detailed life of Bobby Fischer, his relationship with his mother, and who taught him what. The most interesting thing about him was his incredible talent.",9,17,23,15 February 2016
Hidden Figures," Black women in the space program film that gilds the lily
","We baby boomers remember the intensity of the space program very well, and it's brought home in 'Hidden Figures,' a 2016 film starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spancer, Janelle Monae, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, and Jim Parsons.The acting in this inspiring story is excellent, natural, and low key. Based on a non-fiction book by Margot Lee Shetterly, the film is about three black women who entered the space program as mathematicians. At NASA they had a dual fight - not only were they black, but they were women in a man's world. The film shows the segregation and prejudice they encountered. It also shows a world just before computers came in, with space trajectories figured out in pencil. Totally amazing. The story culminates with - what else - John Glenn's historic orbiting of the earth.Fortunately for these brilliant, ambitious, and determined women, the prejudice shown in the film was actually overdone to make the story of their accomplishments stronger. Their accomplishments were pretty darned impressive anyway.In the film, Katherine (Henson) has to walk 40 minutes to the 'colored' bathroom until her supervisor, Harrison (Costner) finds out about it. In truth, though this is something Mary (Monae) did encounter, Katherine didn't know about a segregated bathroom and used the regular one for years. Katharine, in fact, when interviewed, said that while prejudice existed underneath, in truth, everybody was concentrated on their work.Costner's character is a mixture of different people, as is often done in films. He didn't really allow Katherine into an important meeting - she started pushing to attend them, and did, beginning in 1958. When Mary goes to court so she can attend a white school at night, this didn't happen, though the school was segregated. She requested and received an exemption. You can see that would have looked pretty unexciting on film.I don't think embellishing incidents and creating new ones that don't hurt the true story is a bad thing - the screenwriters wanted to make a point and more importantly, since it is film, do something visually. I think they could have done it without every character so totally against these women. I'm white, and having worked in many offices, I can promise you there's a Jim Parsons character in every one no matter a woman's color. Back then men resented women in positions of authority. Probably many of them still do. The purpose of true stories told in film, I feel, is to get you interested in the topic and read about it. Anyone looking for complete accuracy is going to be sadly disappointed, as I think some of the reviewers on this board were. But in the end, we still had three amazing women working in the space program - and John Glenn did in fact ask Katherine to verify the IBM calculations before his launch. Pretty darned impressive.",7,3,6,11 June 2017
Lincoln," great film, interesting reviews
","Before I write my review, I'd like to note some of reviews I read on this board.Some (not all obviously) people reviewing this film were bored by it, and some thought Daniel Day-Lewis was okay. Just okay.We've really gotten to the point where if one has to listen to what is considered too much dialogue (probably a page's worth in a total script would be too much), the film is slow and boring. If we don't see things blown up and crashed every ten seconds, there's just no action.What a dull, dull tale, the story of a great President as he pushes for the passing of the 13th amendment to abolish slavery and end the Civil War. A big yawn. Not enough bloody Civil War scenes, I guess, and then we're deprived of a big ending too.'Lincoln' is a reverent look at a historical figure, not just as a historical figure, but as a man with children and with a volatile wife, a man who played politics just as they're played today in order to get his way.As far as Daniel Day-Lewis, let me say that not for one second did I think I was watching a performance. I was, in fact, watching Abraham Lincoln, just like when Helen Mirren played Queen Elizabeth, I was watching Queen Elizabeth. It is a rare, rare actor that can work that magic. As brilliant as Meryl Streep was in some sections of 'The Iron Lady,' there were other times when it was an impersonation, not the woman.I found this a brilliant and important film, meticulous in its detail and research, right down to the ticking of Lincoln's watch. A man who cares enough to have the actual watch that belonged to Lincoln heard ticking is a caring and committed director.Sally Field fought for this role, and she is brilliant. As Thaddeus Stevens, Tommy Lee Jones is wonderful, and the whole cast is great: James Spader, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Walton Goggins, etc. - all brilliant and well cast.I have one criticism, brought out by another reviewer - after 2-1/2 hours, why was the assassination not depicted? This to me is one flaw, though I'm sure if I actually spoke to Spielberg, he could convince me of his reasoning.As some side trivia, Tad Lincoln died at around age 18; Robert Lincoln lived until 1925, dying at the age of 82. He had two children; the Lincoln line died out in 1985.A monumental film that deserves to be seen and studied.",9,5,9,15 July 2013
Rules of Engagement," Typical but well acted
","'Rules of Engagement' from 2000 is a fairly derivative film. Directed by William Friedkin, it's the story of two men, Colonel Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), a 30-year Marine veteran and decorated officer; and Colonel Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), now an attorney, a man with whom he fought and whose life he saved in Vietnam and has retired.Childers is sent on a rescue mission in Yemen that goes awry when the protesting crowd outside the embassy starts shooting at the Marines. Childers, who already has men down, orders his soldiers to fire into the crowd. He is able to evacuate the embassy but finds himself in trouble due to the fact that no one believes the protesters had weapons. He is put on trial and asks Hodges to defend him. Hodges doesn't feel he's a good enough attorney, but he agrees to take the case.There is a tape of what happened, but the head of security (Bruce Greenwood) who doesn't want the United States to take the rap for killing civilians and would rather have it fall on a soldier, burns it. And Childers gets no support from the Ambassador (Ben Kingsley) or his wife (Anne Archer), and the attorney on the other side (Guy Pearce) is out for blood.We've seen this film in various guises before, and the good versus evil is typical Hollywood. The acting is good but I have difficulty understanding the casting of Ben Kingsley, a great Oscar-winning actor, who is completely wasted in what is not even really a supporting role. Anne Archer plays his wife. The two have a small son and have been married for ten years. May I suggest that though it's entirely feasible that Archer at 43 had a child, the casting seems a little off. Often, when directors want a certain actor, the agency representing them agrees on the condition that the director take other people on his roster. I suspect this is what happened here; the casting is not quite right for these distinguished actors.Tommy Lee Jones in particular is good as Hodges, though he has the showier role. Samuel Jackson is always very good and gives a strong performance as well, but there's something very stereotypical about both parts. Bruce Greenwood at least is interesting casting - he seems pretty mild-mannered as the Head of Security, but there's a treachery underneath.All in all, this is an okay film, one where you know how it's going to end and basically what's going to happen while it's going on. We see two stars who have done their roles before in other circumstances. So in the end, while it has its moments, it's somewhat routine. One of those if you've seen one, you've seen them all type films.",6,4,7,11 February 2013
Million Dollar Baby," a knockout punch
","I grew up watching Clint Eastwood as Rowdy Yates on 'Rawhide.' Who could have imagined, looking at his unlined face and watching his easygoing manner, that he would ever have developed into the filmmaker that he has? Though we should have known Clint was something special - in those days, it was nearly impossible to move from a hit TV show into films, as the typecasting was even worse than it is today. But Clint did it.Unfortunately for me, I knew the plot and ending of this film before walking into the theater. Because of the staggered release of MDB, it was almost impossible not to. I would have liked to assess the impact not knowing the twists and turns of the plot.That being said, I found this a beautifully-realized story about dreams, courage, and the true meaning of family.The three principals did a tremendous job. Hillary Swank is so much more than an actress. She is able to break a role down down to its simplest elements and becomes the character. There is never anything overdone in her work. She is one of the finest actresses we have. Morgan Freeman is one of the finest actors we have. And Clint Eastwood? Well, he's just one of the finest directors we have. Congratulations, Rowdy.",9,6,10,5 February 2005
Garden State," Coming home
","Zach Braff stars in 'Garden State,' a film he also wrote and directed -those are some accomplishments.Braff plays a heavily medicated young man, Andrew Largeman, who comes back to his home town upon the death of his mother. He's on complete disconnect from his father (Ian Holm) who also is his psychiatrist. While in a doctor's office for headaches, he meets the beautiful Sam (Natalie Portman) who claims she's at the doctor's because she's a robot who needs to get charged. It's this kind of off-the-cuff humor that makes 'Garden State' a truly unique, touching and wonderful film. Large and Sam are as opposite as can be - she talks incessantly; he's quiet; she cries at card tricks; he claims he never cries, including at his mother's funeral. Yet they connect, and she opens up a world of feeling to him that he's never known. As he tells his father, he's been numb for years. So he takes a vacation from all those medications to find out who he is.I can't relate to this movie the way that some people on the board can - this isn't my generation - but because of the acting and the story, I can appreciate what they're going through. And it doesn't matter what generation you are - being young is tough going.The acting is uniformly excellent, with Portman being a standout as a vivacious, friendly young woman who embraces life. There are some familiar faces -Portman, Jean Smart, Ian Holm, Ron Liebman and Peter Sarsgaard as well as some young and attractive new ones. Very well done by Braff; I look forward to seeing more of his work.",8,1,2,9 August 2007
Donnie Brasco," Gangster film directed by Mike Newell
","In 1997, two of the screen's greatest actors, Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, got together and made the true story of undercover FBI agent Joe Pistone, whose alias was 'Donnie Brasco,' which is the film's title. It's not a movie you hear a lot about, as it probably got lost among the plethora of post-Godfather mob films. However, it's well above average for the cast and characterizations.Pistone risks everything to get in with the mob, attaching himself to Lefty (Al Pacino). Lefty isn't a big boss - he's a middleman, the one who takes all the risks and continually is passed over for promotion. He takes Donnie under his wing, teaches him the lingo, how to dress, etc. All the while, Donnie is meeting his FBI boss for coffee and passing him information. As Donnie gets in deeper and deeper, his harried wife (Anne Heche), who rarely sees him, becomes disgusted. He is constantly disappointing his children. Soon he begins to identify with the mob, even speaking like them, more than he identifies with the FBI. And he realizes that once he comes out of the mob, Lefty, who brought him in and with whom he has a bond, will be murdered.Pacino and Depp are extraordinary together and give fantastic performances. Pacino isn't the powerful don as Michael Corleone was; he's a worker bee who takes orders. One feels sorry for where his life has gone. Depp's Joe is badly treated by the FBI - his frustration, anger, and confusion over his own feelings are apparent. They both elevate this film.Anne Heche does a terrific job as Joe's unhappy wife, who adores him nevertheless, and Michael Madsen is great as a big boss with more temper than brains.Mike Newell directs 'Donnie Brasco' well, showing us the mean, depressing streets of New York, and the violence and stress of mob life, where your best friend can be the one who takes you out. It's not a glamorized picture of either the Mafia or the FBI. In fact, the two organizations have a lot in common. They're both lousy to their employees.",8,0,2,28 October 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Rough stuff
","Noomi Rapace is Lisbeth Salander, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,' a 2009 Swedish film also starring Michael Nyqvist. The film is based on the first book of the Millennium trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson.Nyqvist plays journalist Mikael Blomkvist, a reporter who broke a story about a well-known businessman, was sued for libel, and lost. He knows he was set up, and he has to wait six months for his sentencing. The executives on his newspaper suggest that he lay low for awhile. A paid assignment comes from a member of the powerful Vanger family, Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube). Henrik is old and frail, and before he dies, he wants to see if Blomkvist can solve the disappearance of his niece forty years earlier. Blomkvist lives in the guest house of the Vanger mansion and gets to work.Soon he realizes that he's not alone -- someone -- Lisbeth Salander -- is hacking into his computer and looking into the case as well - not because she has interest in it, but because she's investigating Blomqvist for the security company for which she works, Merrin Security Inc.Lisbeth is a goth, on probation for a crime we don't learn much about initially. She has been given a new probation officer (called a guardian) who asks for sexual favors in order to grant her money from her account. Despite what she's going through, it doesn't take long for the reporter and the brilliant computer hacker to join forces. They can probably crack the case, but it doesn't seem likely that Blomqvist can ever crack Lisbeth's hard shell. She's a mysterious, pencil-thin, seemingly hard and unemotional woman who won't answer questions about herself.This is an incredible film that despite its gorgeous cinematography, is very dark, filled with mystery, tension, sexual perversion, murder, monsters, and violence, not to mention a few twists to the story.Totally absorbing. I have not seen the American version yet, which I understand is also excellent. The performances in this version are marvelous. Somehow Rapace manages to show that Lisa has some vulnerability, and one really roots for her and doesn't blame her for some of her more aggressive actions.'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' for me was a very raw, intense experience, so I'm not sure I'll see the American version. But I am looking forward to seeing the two subsequent Swedish films from the trilogy. Really excellent, and not recommended for those with a squeamish stomach.",9,1,2,3 May 2012
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Clash of the Titans
","Edward R. Murrow goes up against Senator Joseph McCarthy in 'Good Night, and Good Luck,' a 2005 using Murrow's famous sign-off on the news program 'See It Now' as its title. The stars are David Strathairn, George Clooney, Jeff Daniels, Patricia Clarkson, Ray Wise, Frank Langella, and Robert Downey, Jr. The story is set during the time of the HUAC investigations, when Murrow was one of the few newsmen willing to go up against the powerful senator who saw a Communist under every bed, Joseph McCarthy. It's an especially timely story post-9/11 as it concerns the violation of civil rights and use of fear tactics in order to exploit the insecurity rampant in the country at that time. Director/writer George Clooney couldn't have chosen a better subject.Like the film 'Thirteen Days' about the Cuban missile crisis, the brilliance of the film is in its use of actual transcripts, here from 'See it Now.' In the case of 'Good Night, and Good Luck,' we also see real footage from the investigations and hear Joseph McCarthy himself as he goes after witnesses and Murrow. It makes for fascinating viewing.Though there were some minor errors, the attention to detail to evoke the '50s atmosphere is fantastic, the black and white only adding to it. The acting is superb, if you can call what David Strahairn did acting. I felt throughout the entire film that I was watching Edward R. Murrow, not someone portraying him. Strathairn is a flawless actor who becomes the character he's playing and makes every mannerism, vocal rhythm, and cigarette puff totally organic. His Murrow is tough, with internalized anger and a dry sense of humor. 'I'm busy bringing down your network tonight,' he tells Paley as he refuses an invitation.Frank Langella's William Paley is marvelous, a man who tries to walk the fence but ends up falling over to one side. I probably already knew somewhere in the recesses of my mind about Don Hollenbeck, the character well portrayed by Ray Wise; that story arc was telegraphed from the beginning. It might have been criticized for being a cliché, except of course it really happened. Hollenbeck's story was perhaps not fleshed out enough.All in all, a brilliant achievement and a sad one. Without people like Murrow, journalism has changed, and not for the better? And the world? Though the names of the threats and their exploiters have changed, the fault, dear Brutus, still doesn't lie within our stars, but in ourselves.",8,0,1,6 April 2007
Mulholland Drive," A bizarre journey through the subconscious
","It's not often that a film that leaves one confused and frustrated can be described as great, but I have to hand it to David Lynch. 'Mulholland Drive' is a great film and requires several viewings to mine all that is there. And there is plenty there. This isn't a pretentious director throwing something completely nonsensical on a screen that high-brow critics scream is great art when it is, in fact, junk.Supposedly, 'Mulholland Dr.' was intended as a series, but it didn't work out. That's a shame, because it could have been pretty amazing. It was perhaps ahead of its time. Today, with cable networks doing so much original programming, it would have found a place.I can't say too much about it, because everyone will have their own ideas and theories of the film. In the beginning, it concerns a botched hit due to a freak accident on Mulholland Drive. The victim escapes and hides out in an apartment, but she has amnesia. The woman staying in the apartment, Betty, becomes interested in her problem.Except it's not about that at all. It's a dark, intriguing trip into the world of the subconscious, filled with crazy images, bizarre characters, and some strange dialogue.Not an easy film to dissect, so watch it for yourself, and then go back and watch it again. Take note of the sign 'Sunset Boulevard' - and prepare to be mesmerized.",8,1,3,13 August 2010
The Imitation Game," beautiful performance by Benedict Cumberbatch
","Benedict Cumberbatch is codebreaker Alan Turing in 'The Imitation Game,' a 2014 film based on the true story of Alan Turing, a mathematical genius and the father of the modern computer.The first review on this site complained that the movie is historically inaccurate. Most biopics and films about famous events are historically inaccurate. Films say, 'Based on a true story,' not 'an absolute factual true story.' Events are moved or telescoped, characters are combined, etc. because it's a movie, not a book that lists facts. The idea is to become interested in the subject and go home and read about it.Detractors of this film, some of whom haven't seen it, state over and over that the Poles broke the Enigma code. This has nothing to do with the movie. The Poles broke the code, but NO ONE HAD EVER BROKEN THE German NAVAL CODE. Turing built his machine -- which looked like the one in the film, by the way, to break that code. You'll notice that everything discussed had to do with vessels, convoys, ships, etc. 'The Imitation Game' is not about a machine. Also World War II, being one of our larger wars, was certainly not won by one man, but by the work of many, including the early work of the Poles, who are honored at Bletchley Park just as Alan Turing is honored.This is the story of literally a tortured genius, isolated, very much in his own head, antisocial, but a man who believed in his own abilities. He goes to work trying to break the German code; the codes are reset daily, which means if you can't break the code in a day, all your work is for nothing, and the next day, you start over. The idea was to get the code broken in a matter of minutes instead of hours using the machine.Turing is not easily accepted by his coworkers (Matthew Goode, Allen Leech, Matthew Beard) but gets along well with Joan (Keira Knightley), who urges him to be a little friendlier because 'you're going to need 'all the help you can get.' They have to fight to continue their work, since it's not happening fast enough for the government.It's been said Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role of a brilliant eccentric well, but this character is the complete opposite of Sherlock, though their minds might work similarly. It's a passionate, intense performance. He is perfect as the socially inept Turing, a true nerd, a bullied schoolboy who had but one friend growing up. His portrayal is heartbreaking.Let's hope we've improved as a people and, because of sexual proclivities are less likely to crucify someone who has made a tremendous contribution to the world. Genius takes many forms, and as Turing's friend Christopher says, 'Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.'",10,6,13,26 December 2014
Jerry Maguire," A sports agent finds the high road steep
","Tom Cruise, before his chin implant, is 'Jerry Maguire' in this 1996 film also starring Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jay Mohr and Bonnie Hunt. Beautifully directed by Cameron Crowe, the film tells the story of a hotshot sports agent who writes a piece about the ethics of being a sports agent, encouraging a smaller client list and more personal service. He then passes it out to the rest of the agents in the firm, SMI. It goes without saying that he's fired, but before he goes, he asks if there is anyone who wants to go with him as he sets out on his own. A single mother, Dorothy (Zellweger), inspired by his missive though partially blinded by the stars in her eyes, says yes. Jerry ends up minus his fiancée (Kelly Preston) and stuck with one client (Gooding) that no one is particularly interested in, a football player whose mantra is 'Show me the money!' But no one is. As he struggles to make a lucrative deal for his client, Jerry has to also deal with his personal life - Dorothy and her love for him, which he can't really return, her mistrusting sister (Hunt) and Dorothy's son (Jonathan Lipnicki) whom he adores.This is a fast-moving film with wonderful performances and lots of warmth, humor and honesty. Jerry learns quickly that when it comes to money, he's friendless, that there's very little loyalty and lots of liars. Tom Cruise is excellent as a young man trying to find his way through a labyrinth of a client with a bad attitude, no money, a hasty marriage and staying with the principles in his manifesto. Zellweger, in her career-making performance, is sweet and touching as Dorothy. Gooding has the most flamboyant part and makes the most of it as an athlete who has to learn that in order to have someone show him the money, he has to show a little heart first.A great movie, highly regarded for a reason, with a soundtrack to match. Highly recommended.",8,7,11,28 March 2008
The Adjustment Bureau," The plan, the plan
","Matt Damon falls in love and interferes with 'The Plan' in this 2011 film also starring Emily Blunt, Terrence Stamp, and John Slattery.Damon plays David Norris, a congressman running for Senate who at the last minute loses due to a college prank that is highly publicized. He goes to the mens room to rehearse his concession speech, and there he meets a beautiful young woman, Elise (Emily Blunt) hiding from security. They talk, and she encourages him to be who he is and to be honest. There's an instant attraction, and they kiss. David walks out and gives a brilliant speech, so good, in fact, that there is interest in him for the next Senate race. In the meantime, he takes a job at his campaign manager's firm. On his way to work, whom should he see on the bus but the woman from the mens room, and this time, he gets her number.When he walks into work, however, there are a group of men there running what looks like a scanner over his boss. David runs but the men catch him. It is then that he learns that these men are his case workers. Everyone has them, to make sure that they adhere to the plan. The plan has been devised by The Chairman (Terrence Stamp). The case workers tweak little things in order to guide David - not his personality, not his emotions, but with the purpose of keeping him on track so that he can achieve his purpose. The head case worker, Richardson (John Slattery) tells David that according to the plan, David was never supposed to run into Elise again, and they move to make sure he doesn't connect with her a third time. But David can't forget her.This is an interesting premise, building on the idea that everything, even spilling your coffee, happens for a reason; that, in fact, we are all guided by angels, which some people call the caseworkers, to make sure that we achieve the life and goals set by The Chairman.The science fiction premise is mixed with romance here, with both Blunt and Damon giving warm, charming performances. I was left feeling, though, that as sweet as the film was, it could have been better. Nevertheless, it's nice to see an original idea on the screen, and I applaud it.Intriguing. See it.",7,1,2,27 June 2012
Rudy," Brick walls aren't to keep you out
","Sean Astin is 'Rudy' in this 1993 true story of Rudy Ruettiger, a short, average kid who wanted to dress for the Notre Dame football team. Rudy's story is one that is used to demonstrate the power of single-mindedness and determination in the face of all odds. His story provides a great lesson - the brick walls aren't there to keep you out, they're only there to keep out the people who don't want something badly enough.Rudy grows up obsessed with Notre Dame football, but he lacks the physical prowess for the game and the grades for Notre Dame. He also comes from a family, headed by Ned Beatty, whose attitude is, know your place and stay there, and whose goals are to join the union, work a union job, and have a home and family. Rudy's girlfriend wants to get married, and the only person who understands his dream is his best friend. When tragedy strikes, Rudy realizes that he has to pursue his dream or he'll never be happy.This is a very inspirational film, all the more inspirational because it's true. Sean Astin gives a very natural performance as Rudy - he doesn't 'act' in the sense of giving an emotional, big performance, but rather behaves like a young man from a lower middle class family in Joliet, Illinois, probably much as the real Rudy acted.Life can be pretty frustrating and when trying to break through a glass ceiling or a brick wall like Rudy did, it's tempting to want to give up. People today want things to happen fast, too. Rudy's compelling story says that passion and perseverance can bring you a long way. Here was a kid with no money, no family support, dyslexia, average grades, who was too wimpy for football. Watch what happens to him.",7,6,7,14 March 2009
Prisoners," one scary movie
","Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Maria Bello star in 'Prisoners' from 2013, directed by Denis Villeneuve.When two little girls go missing on Thanksgiving Day, one of the fathers, Keller Dover (Jackman) reels completely out of control searching for her. He kidnaps one of the suspects (Paul Dano) and tortures him for information, and, a recovering alcoholic, starts drinking again. The policeman on the case, Loki (Gyllenhaal) starts trailing him while searching for the children and looking at suspects.What a dark, gritty movie, photographed in muted colors that make the film look old. The landscape is stark. People aren't particularly well-dressed. The cars are old.This is a movie about prisoners of all types - emotional, physical, addictive. In Prisoners, everyone is just that, in his or her own way. Truly a suspenseful movie with a fantastic performance by Hugh Jackman -- perhaps his best -- as the crazed father. A brooding Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the police officer who is desperate to find the girls.Prisoners is not always easy to watch, but you won't be able to turn away.",10,1,2,18 February 2014
The Insider," excellent drama
","How far would you go to tell the truth? How far would you go to protect a source? In 99.99% of the cases, the answer is: not very far, not when your job, your family, and your life is on the line.'The Insider', a 1999 film directed by Michael Mann, dramatizes the true story of two men who stopped at nothing to get out their story - Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) and Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) though they are thwarted every time they turn around.Michael Mann assembled a stellar cast - besides Crowe and Pacino, there is Christopher Plummer playing Mike Wallace, Diane Venora as Wigand's wife, Lindsay Crouse as Bergman's wife, Colm Feore as a Mississippi attorney, Gina Gershon as the CBS attorney, Michael Gambon as Thomas Sandefur, the head of Brown & Williamson Tobacco, Philip Baker Hall as Don Hewitt, and some Broadway people, including Roger Bart and Lynne Thigpen.Jeffrey Wigand was a whistle-blower on his former employer, Brown & Williamson, claiming that the company was aware that nicotine was addictive and was using a carcinogen called coumarin in their cigarettes, though the 'seven dwarfs' as Wigand called them, the big seven tobacco companies, all had lied in hearings about nicotine being addictive.That's only part of the story. Wigand loses everything in his attempt to tell the truth - he is fired from his job, he has to sell his house, his family is terrorized until his wife and children finally leave him, a smear campaign is started against him, he is slapped with restraining orders, threatened with arrest, his computer is confiscated. And then the worst cut of all - 60 Minutes decides not to air the interview after pressure from the CBS Corporation. Tobacco, it seems, with its billions of dollars, can do whatever it takes to silence someone.Lowell Bergman, realizing that his source has been left out to dry, goes to bat for him in order to get the interview aired, and turns the tables on CBS, risking his own career and relationships with people with whom he has worked for years. He finds out along the way what these people were made of -- not much. In the end, Wallace cares only about his career and legacy, and Don Hewitt bows to CBS. Bergman wins by playing the ultimate hardball and humiliating 60 Minutes.This is a long film but a very gripping story. It takes its time to build instead of rushing the drama without fleshing out the characters. By the end of the film, we know who all of these people are.I remember seeing this in the theater. It was very powerful in 1999, and it's even more powerful today. Why? Because I think there are way fewer Wigands and Bergmans in the world than there were 11 years ago, and it was a dwindling population then - people whose integrity is more important than money. In 'The Insider,' at least we get to meet two.",10,7,9,4 November 2010
Quiz Show," Excellent '50s tale of reality TV that wasn't
","I was growing up during the Charles Van Doren scandal, and I remember his face on the front page of the paper and my mother crying. When I asked her what happened, she said, 'He told a lie.' He told a whole bunch of them, in fact, and was part of the quiz show scandal of the '50s, which Quiz Show so beautifully dramatizes. Robert Redford does a fantastic job of recreating the atmosphere in perfect detail, as well as the fascinating story of the '50s version of reality TV, the quiz shows, going awry.Paul Scofield is absolutely mind-boggling as Van Doren Sr., and Ralph Fiennes is wonderful, handsome, and charismatic as Charles Van Doren. The rest of the cast is marvelous - John Turturro, David Paymer, Hank Azaria, and Rob Morrow.Van Doren was a dream contestant - good-looking, educated, with a beautiful speaking voice - and captivated the country with his intelligence. Unfortunately, it wasn't reality at all, just fantasy. But, as Van Doren says while verbally sparring with his dad, 'It was mine own.' It sure was, and he went into oblivion because of it.",8,76,82,26 July 2005
The Greatest Game Ever Played," great film, even if you have no interest in golf
","Disney tells a wonderful underdog saga with 'The Greatest Game Ever Played,' the true story of Francis Ouimet, the father of amateur golf, directed by Bill Paxton, starring Shia LaBeouf, Stephen Dillane, Marnie McPhail, Elias Koteas, Josh Flitter, and Stephen Marcus.The Massachusetts-born Ouimet was the child of a Canadian father and Irish mother, who grew up across the street from a country club, where he started caddying at the age of 11. Golf at that time was prominent in Britain, and the British were the world's best golfers. It was a sport of the rich. Francis Ouimet, like the great British golfer, Harry Vardon, came from poor circumstances. In one of the first scenes, Vardon is summoned to an exclusive club. He believes, as a golf champion, that he is being invited to become a member; instead, the club wants him to work for them.Against his father's wishes, Ouimet begins to compete as an amateur golfer, ultimately qualifying for the U.S. Open in 1913. The championship resulted in a three-way playoff between Vardon, Ted Roy, and Ouimet. Ouimet's upset win popularized amateur golf in the United States.Ouimet's caddie was a ten-year-old boy, Eddie Lowery, whose brother couldn't caddie because he was caught by a truant officer.Bill Paxton has done a great job directing this rousing film, giving the viewer the feeling that his is there on the course, watching the various shots as they travel across the green.The performances are excellent, with LaLaBeouf doing an amazing job as Ouimet, who puts up with prejudice and hardship to live his dream. As Eddie, Josh Flitter is fantastic as Eddie, a little adult with sage advice. Standouts in the rest of the cast are Stephen Dillane as Harry Vardon, and the actors who play Ouimet's parents, Elias Koteas in a very emotional, heartfelt performance as Francis' tough, protective father, and Marnie McPhail, a pretty woman who exudes warmth as Francis' loving and encouraging mother.Highly recommended - this is an inspiring film for the whole family, beautifully produced and acted.",10,0,2,9 September 2013
Annie Hall," One of the best-remembered films of the '70s
","In 1977, everyone was talking about 'Annie Hall,' Woody Allen's film about a romance gone wrong. There was the 'Annie Hall' look, 'la-di-da,' and TV shows ripped off the lobster scene. Thirty-four years later, 'Annie Hall' still holds up as a great Allen film.Allen breaks the fourth wall and talks directly to the audience. The film is shamelessly biographical - the main character is a neurotic comedian, Alvy Singer, who is well-known. Diane Keaton, for whom the screenplay was written, plays Annie (Keaton's real last name is Hall and people call her Annie). The two meet and make an unlikely couple: she's from the midwest, and he's a native New Yorker and Jewish, growing up under the Coney Island roller-coaster. She's an aspiring singer; he's been in therapy for 15 years. Gradually their differences overwhelm their feelings for one another.The script is fabulous - witty, hilarious, charming, whimsical, and bittersweet. And the chemistry between Allen and Keaton is wonderful. Both are perfect. Tony Roberts plays a friend of Alvy's, Carol Kane plays Alvy's ex-wife, Allison, Paul Simon is Tony Lacey, and Christopher Walken is Annie's brother. His short role is responsible for one of the most hilarious scenes in the film.The film has a very modern perspective - relationships are next to impossible but we need them so we keep trying. As Woody says at the beginning of the film: 'Life is full of loneliness, and misery, and suffering, and unhappiness, and it's all over much too quickly.' We just have to keep slogging through.",Null,1,2,4 September 2011
"Girl, Interrupted"," Girl, institutionalized
","Winona Ryder is a 'Girl, Interrupted' in this 1999 film also starring Angelina Jolie, Whoopi Goldberg, Brittany Murphy, Jeffrey Tambor, Vanessa Redgrave and Clea Duvall. Ryder is Susanna, a high school graduate from a good family who attempts suicide and is then institutionalized. The script, in fact, is based on Susanna Kaysen's real-life account of her time in a mental institution in the '60s. In denial about her condition, she observes the 'crazies' around her, finally becoming friends with an 8-year resident, Lisa (Angelia Jolie) whose biting insights and bucking of authority keep the place lively and keep Susanna going. As Susanna recovers and comes face to face with a devastating tragedy, she realizes that Lisa's type of resistance is not the way to go and that she must involve herself in the therapeutic process so that she can go home.This is a very dramatic and emotional story that I admit right up front left me sobbing. Though dark and often sad, it is a very life-affirming movie. The acting is beyond superb. Jolie, in her Oscar-winning performance, has the tour de force role, and she's magnificent. Jolie is one of those people whose once bizarre personality traits and now humanitarian efforts and relationship with Brad Pitt occasionally obliterate the fact that she's a fabulous and versatile actress. Ryder is stunning as the confused and depressed Susanna. Unfortunately, one of her first lines in the film is, 'Did you ever steal something when you had the cash?' - if people did a riff on that when she was arrested for shoplifting, I missed it. She's another one whose personal peccadilloes have overshadowed some wonderful acting. These two women are surrounded by a marvelous cast of pros, including Redgrave as a patient psychiatrist, Goldberg as a tough but kind RN on the ward and Brittany Murphy as a deeply disturbed young woman. All of the women who play patients are excellent and will tear at your heart.'Girl, Interrupted' is a brilliant film and probably an underrated one. It's possible that people who hadn't seen it when Jolie won the Oscar were put off by her strange appearance at the Oscars as well as the interviews she gave about being in love with her brother, rough sex, and her use of sharp instruments. Then Ryder had her day. I truly hope none of that kept people from renting this movie, because it - and they - are beautiful.",9,1,1,29 January 2008
Blood Diamond," That bling on your finger is bloody
","Edward Zwick does another brilliant piece of directing in 'Blood Diamond,' a 2006 film starring Leonardo di Caprio, Jennifer Connelly, and Djimon Hounsou.Set during the Sierra Leone Civil War in 1999, the film shows a country torn apart by the struggle between government soldiers and rebel forces.[1] The film portrays many of the atrocities of that war, including the rebels' amputation of people's hands to stop them from voting in upcoming elections.The diamond industry, as the ivory industry before it, is proving disastrous to civilians as the film opens in 1999. When the RUF (Revolutionary United Front) invade Shenge, a small Sierra Leonian village, a man, Solomon (Hounsou) is taken as the rest of his family escapes and made to work in the diamond fields. Diamonds are smuggled into Liberia and exported from there, its profits used by the rebels to fund the war. Solomon's son, meanwhile, is conscripted into the rebel forces and brainwashed, becoming a child killer.While working in the fields, Solomon finds a large pink diamond and manages to hide it just as there is an attack. He is seen hiding it by the captain, Poison (David Harewood). Harewood is badly injured, but along with Solomon and the others, he is arrested. While in prison, he screams that Solomon has a large diamond. Once out of prison, Solomon is approached by a mercenary (di Caprio) who wants that diamond in order to sell it to a middleman, who in turn will sell it to one of the legitimate cartels. Solomon wants his family. Then they meet a beautiful journalist (Jennifer Connelly) who wants to expose the big diamond cartel as dealing in blood diamonds.A violent, powerful, beautifully photographed and fascinating story with an extraordinary performance by Leonardo di Caprio, 'Blood Diamond' leaves little doubt about the greed that has destroyed the lives of so many millions of people. Zwick tells the story graphically. Hounsou, Connelly, Harewood, and the rest of the cast are excellent as people in one way or another caught up in the quest for diamonds, many times in order to just hide them away in order to keep the prices high.At the end of the film, one of the chirons cautions people to demand that the diamonds they buy are conflict-free. Yet, after seeing 'Blood Diamond,' I wonder if one can ever be sure of getting the truth.",8,2,2,5 September 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Memory can change...the heart prevails
","It's hard not to fall in love with a film that begins with a voice-over saying (paraphrasing): 'Valentine's Day was created by card companies to make everybody feel like crap.' Right afterward, I watched Jim Carrey force himself through a half-closed train door, and I said, this is for me.Carrey, in a complete turnabout, plays Joel, a lonely man who falls in love with a lively, quirky nut named Clementine. The romance progresses, fights ensue, and one day, Joel walks into the bookstore where Clementine works, and she's making out with someone else and doesn't seem to even recognize him. Then their friends receive a note saying that Clementine has erased Joel from her memory, and they shouldn't mention him again. Joel heads to the clinic himself to find out what's going on. There he finds programmers who can draw a map of your memories about an individual on the brain and get rid of them. Joel decides to have the procedure. Part of the way through it, he tries desperately to stop it, to find some way to remember Clementine, bringing her into places and memories where she never was. The programmers (Elijah Wood, Thomas Ryan) don't notice anything odd about the procedure because they're busy drinking, dancing in their underwear and doing drugs with Mary (Kirsten Dunst) a secretary at the clinic. When they finally notice a problem, the head man (Howard Wilkinson) is called in. Slowly Clementine disappears from Joel's brain as he desperately tries to hold onto her.A spectacular story with a few twists along the way, and spectacular acting, particularly from Carrey, Winslet and Dunst, make this a real winner. Carrey is a sympathetic, warm character, Winslet is adorable and charming, and Dunst is a complete natural, be she stoned in her underwear, trying to talk sense under the influence, or crying. They are wonderful as is the rest of the cast.'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is about the death of memory but not of emotion and the cry of the heart that goes on - sometimes without knowing why. A beautiful, beautiful film.",10,1,5,15 August 2007
Taken," Go Liam!
","Liam Neeson's daughter is 'Taken' in this 2008 action thriller also starring Famke Janssen, Maggie Grace, and Katie Cassidy.

His ex-wife Lenore (Janssen) has remarried, to a very wealthy man, and she seems to be limiting Bryan's access to his daughter. However, on her 17th birthday, he drops into her party and gives her a gift. He's thrilled when she calls later and says she wants to have lunch with him. However, Lenore comes along; in order for Kim to travel to Paris, she needs his permission and signature. Bryan doesn't agree right away. He's seen the seamier part of life and doesn't want her traveling alone in Paris. He finally agrees to let her go when he learns she'll be staying at the apartment of her traveling companion Amanda's cousins.Of course, the cousins actually aren't there, and rather than haunt the museums, Kim and Amanda are following a rock group's tour. Kim is supposed to call him every night but that slips her mind. When she finally calls, it's just as Amanda is being kidnapped. Bryan remains calm, tells her to get under the bed, and when she is taken, and she will be, to scream out as much of a description as possible.What follows is a rip-roaring, fast moving, kick ass Liam Neeson tracking down the culprits, who are engaged in the trafficking of young women. Bryan takes no prisoners, and he uses every CIA trick at his disposal, including hotwiring cars, torture, gunplay, fighting skills - you name it.This is a terrific movie, and there's just enough of a setup so that we care deeply what happens. So often action films give us a shell of a story and then get right into the action - and while the action can be terrific, this is the type of film you can get into for the characters as well as the action.Liam Neeson - action hero. A new genre for him in 2008; it's a genre hopefully he will explore more.",8,0,2,29 May 2013
Up," The only other time I cried watching an animation film was Bambi
","Pixar's 'Up' is a colorful animation adventure film about the journey of a 78-year-old man to make a long-cherished dream come true. Carl Fredricksen ties balloons to his home and takes off for South America so that he can land his house on some obscure falls. However, he soon learns that an 8-year-old wilderness scout who was trying to assist the elderly so he could get a badge was on the premises when the house took off.This is one of the sweetest films imaginable, reminiscent in the beginning of 'It's a Wonderful Life' - a young boy has dreams of travel, marries his childhood friend; the couple takes on the refurbishment of an old house and finds that life gets in the way of their travel ambitions. Later on, the film becomes a real adventure story, with talking dogs, exotic birds, and a crazed explorer. Fredericksen looks like Spencer Tracy and has the voice of Ed Asner; the explorer, a childhood hero of Fredericksen's, looks like Kirk Douglas and has the voice of Christopher Plummer. All of the voices are delightful.I don't generally care for animated films, but I was swept away by warmth and heart of this one, not to mention its magnificent detail and beauty. It has a lot to say about love, the generations helping one another, and following your dreams. A real winner.",10,0,2,19 January 2010
The Hurricane," Inspirational
","We are always told that our justice system is the best in the world. Given the fact that this film is based on a true story and also given some recent verdicts, I think the reason for the statement is sobering -- if this system is the best, imagine how horrible other systems must be.This film tells the story of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, a prize fighter convicted of murders in a bar that he didn't commit, railroaded by a bigoted cop. Though many people took an interest in Carter's case over the years, it took a group of young Canadians (Deborah Kara Unger, Liev Schreiber, and John Hannah) to come to his aide and not give up. This is thanks to their ward's friendship with Hurricane (Lesra Martin), who is inspired by Hurricane's book. Carter's courageous story is certainly one that should be seen. Rod Steiger plays the Supreme Court judge, and he's wonderful; soap star Debbie Morgan plays Carter's wife, and she gives an excellent performance. The entire cast is very believable.A very spiritual film with an amazing performance by Denzel Washington. This is one of a number of incarceration films to hit the screen in recent years and, with a powerful actor like Denzel in the lead, one of the best.",Null,2,9,22 July 2000
Woman in Gold," The real woman in gold
","Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds star in 'Woman in Gold' from 2015, a true story about the quest of Maria Altmann to recover art stolen from her family by the Nazis in Vienna, the seat of anti-Semitism in Europe.I just want to point out, to answer some of the reviews, that this is not a documentary, it's a movie. Movies combine events, change them around, omit them. No one wants to watch a tedious film that recognizes that it took a huge amount of time to get to the Supreme Court. If you want the actual, factual story of Maria Altmann's journey, you will need to read about it or see one of several documentaries. Films are meant to pique our interest.Altmann speaks with a young attorney, Randy Shoenberg, about recovering The Woman in Gold, a painting by Klimt that is considered a symbol of Vienna. Klimt in fact painted a series of stunning portraits of Altmann's aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer, who died of meningitis at the age of 44. In her will, she asked her husband Ferdinand, who had seen the writing on the wall in Vienna and fled to Prague, to donate the paintings to the Austrian State Gallery.Although he has just started a new job, Shoenberg travels to Vienna to see the will. Along the way there are flashbacks of Vienna in the '30s, where the Bloch-Bauer family lived in opulence. When the Nazis came to their home, they stripped the place of everything valuable - and there was a lot -- and put the family under house arrest.Maria and her husband, an opera singer, manage to escape in a harrowing scene. In flashbacks, Maria is played by the remarkable Tatiana Maslany, the star of 'Orphan Black,' who looks incredibly like a brunette Mirren.This is a touching, beautifully told story of one man's sacrifice and determination and a woman facing up to her past in order to seek justice. Helen Mirren is one of my favorite actresses - here, she is a vibrant, energetic octogenarian who finds the struggle for the painting uncomfortable - several times, meeting a roadblock, she is ready to wash her hands of it, but Schoenberg won't let her. It represents her family to her, and some uncomfortable memories. You can see all of that in Mirren's multilayered performance.Reynolds is excellent as a young man who believes in taking a chance - - he started and failed in his own law practice - and in this case, going for the gold, despite the fact that he has a wife (Katie Holmes), a baby, and one on the way, and an intolerant boss. It doesn't faze him and when Maria wants to quit, he is furious. I disagree that there was no connection between them. In fact, there is a deep one. The quest for the painting comes to represent to him what it means to MariaI highly recommend this film. There are tons of movies about the horrors perpetrated on Jews by the Nazis. The recovery of stolen art is one part of that horror. 'You see a painting,' she tells a group. 'I see my aunt.'",8,9,10,22 November 2015
Groundhog Day," funny and thought-provoking
","In films, we often see people who for one reason or another have to live their lives over, or some segment of it. In Groundhog Day, Bill Murray, who plays weatherman Phil, has to live over Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. He doesn't want to go in the first place -- it's his fourth boring trip -- but he does. Because of an impending blizzard, they get stuck there. But Phil gets really stuck. He finds he can't leave the day, the town, or the people.Every day at the same time, his alarm radio turns on and plays 'I Got You Babe' by Sonny and Cher. And it's Groundhog Day. At first Phil is furious and takes it out on his broadcast about the ceremony, angering his associates (Andie McDowell and Chris Elliot) who didn't like him much to begin with. As the day continues to repeat itself, Phil finds different ways to deal with it. He picks up a woman, proposes to her so he can have sex with her, knowing that the next day the whole experience will be wiped out for her. He sees an old friend, an insurance man, puts up with him for so long, and then punches him.Finally Phil figures out how to cope with the day, which he's resigned to re-live for the rest of his life.Very funny film with Bill Murray in top form as Phil. Murray underplays the role, which somehow makes his lines funnier, dripping as they often are with sarcasm. He's very funny, and funniest when he's pretending to be sincere.The best thing about Groundhog Day is that, like City Slickers, underneath the humor, it's quite serious. It's about how we choose to deal with the situation that we're in, what we would do if we could do a part of our life over, discovering who we are, and letting go of preconceived notions.The film reminded me of something a teacher once said. If you were in an airport and there was an announcement that you would never be able to leave, every need would be met, but you would stay in the airport forever, what would happen? The teacher pointed out that initially everybody would be trying to figure a way out. It's only when you realize that there is no way out that there would be an opportunity for something wonderful to develop in that place, among those people.Groundhog Day is a wonderful film, beautifully directed by Harold Ramis, who co-wrote the screenplay with Danny Rubin, that delivers a great message using humor. You'll probably never want to hear 'I Got You Babe' again, though.",8,1,4,21 January 2014
National Treasure," High entertaining
","Nicholas Cage, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Jon Voight and Justin Bartha star in 'National Treasure,' a 2004 adventure film directed by Jon Turteltaub.This is one of those movies where you just have to totally give yourself over to the preposterous story and have a good time. Cage is a member of the notorious Gates family, who have claimed for years that there is a vast treasure somewhere hidden by our forefathers. Cage gets a wealthy man (Bean) to underwrite his quest, which leads to an important clue. That clue eventually leads them to an invisible map... behind the Declaration of Independence. By then, Cage and Bean are mortal enemies, and the race is on.'National Treasure' is tremendously fun and even has some historical information embedded in it that viewers should find interesting. Its success led to National Treasure 2. Cage is always worth seeing, as is Bean. This is a film meant to be enjoyed - not dissected.",7,0,1,22 November 2008
Limitless," be prepared to hate the ending - but I won't spoil it
","Bradley Cooper is 'Limitless' in this 2011 film, also starring Robert DeNiro and Abbie Comish.Cooper plays a loser would-be writer, Eddie Morra, who has a book contract but can't seem to write. In the beginning of the film, we see his girlfriend (Comish) leaving him, after which he runs into his drug-dealing ex-brother-in-law on the street. His brother-in-law claims to be working for a pharmaceutical company now and has gone legit, and has a new drug he gives Eddie to try out. Eddie does, and finds that he is able to completely clean his mess of an apartment, write his book, and mine information in his mind he didn't know he had. After one pill, he wants a stash of them.Morra soon learns there is a downside to this mysterious drug, called NZT, including being stalked by his loan shark, who steals one of the pills from Eddie and wants more.Really fascinating film with good performances by the leads. The ending, though, was a major letdown in a way, almost as if it was rushed. I think, however, that much is left up to the audience.Some people who reviewed this movie on IMDb didn't care for the message, but I think the message really comes from how one interprets the ending.I can't really say much more without spoilers -- it's a film ripe for discussion, it's fun, it's entertaining, Cooper is great eye candy, and it brings up some interesting questions. We don't use our whole brain, but what if we could? Will we ever be able to become transhuman? Should we? It's an old thought, demonstrated in this newish movie. I don't think NZT is the answer.",8,1,3,27 June 2013
Shine," Powerful film
","'Shine' purports to tell the story of David Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush, who plays the adult Helfgott), a promising pianist who overcame mental illness, with the help of his wife, and returned to performing.The 1996 film is actually a fictionalized version of Helfgott's life - but even had it not been based on a true story, it remains a powerful, intriguing film.David is the child of German émigrés who now live in Australia. His father Peter (Armin Mueller-Stahl) is a self-taught pianist who teaches David his same love of piano and classical music. There is love there, but as portrayed in the movie, Peter is a rigid man who gives his son mixed signals. He drives his son to succeed as a pianist, teaching him that winning is everything, and yet, when David has opportunities that would take him away from the family, Peter won't permit it. The reason for this is that Peter and his wife lost relatives in the Holocaust. Peter is also given to physical abuse toward David when he loses his temper.David finally gets away from him and attends the Royal Conservatory in London, where, with the help of his teacher (John Gielgud), he wins an important competition but then suffers a severe nervous breakdown. The rest of the movie deals with the road back, which leads him home to Australia and to his wife, Gillian. Gillian is actually his second wife, though the first marriage isn't mentioned in the film.The dominant performances belong to Rush and Mueller-Stahl. Rush does a brilliant job of showing us the likable but stuttering David who speaks rapidly and repetitively, expressing himself through music. Mueller-Stahl as the tortured Peter is fabulous, a man who is both monstrous and pitiable. In a small role, John Gielgud of course makes a fine impression as an elderly teacher, a wonderful pianist himself, who believes in David's talent.The best scene is David playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3 - Helfgott's own recording of the piece is used - and the aftermath. What I missed in this film is music - there was a lot of talk about David's promise, but until the Rachmaninoff not much playing.Helfgott's work today has been deeply criticized for being - well, lousy. A review in The New York Times of one of his concerts is horrible. The reviewer, however, mentions that Helfgott occasionally showed vestiges of excellent technique. I think it's safe to assume that his playing nowadays is more erratic than it was in his earlier years. There are several examples of Helfgott's playing in the movie: 'La Campanella,' 'Hungarian Rhapsody No 2 In C Sharp Minor,' 'Flight of the Bumble Bee,' Rachmaninoff's 'Prelude In C Sharp Minor, Opus 3, No. 2,' the previously mentioned Rachmaninoff 3, and Liszt's 'Sospiro,' and it is all quite stunning. Rush does the fingerings himself. One of the comments also claims that Helfgott's wife has Helfgott perform on no medication so that he'll seem crazy - it's common for performers on medication for mental problems to have to cycle off of it before performing. I don't think the commenter has any idea what Helfgot is like on his medication - certainly in the film, he acts strangely.'Shine' is highly recommended for its fantastic performances, beautiful music, and its inspiring story.",8,18,19,3 April 2009
Inside Man," Excellent and absorbing
","'Inside Man' is a wonderful Spike Lee film starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Willem Dafoe, Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer. It's about a bank robbery planned by Owen that turns out to be something very clever and very different. Washington plays a police detective under investigation for missing money who, knowing he's innocent, wants to prove himself and get to detective first grade. He and his partner investigate this bank robbery, which has 50 hostages, all who have been given outfits and masks so that they're dressed like the robbers. Therefore, it's impossible to tell who the robbers are. It's also increasingly difficult, as Washington attempts to negotiate with them, to tell what it is they're after. When Foster, a high-level negotiator hired by the bank owner (Plummer) enters the scene, Washington knows something much bigger than money is involved.Really excellent movie with twists and turns combined with humor and some really scary scenes. My only complaint is that Clive Owen is a bad choice to play someone who spends most of the movie in a mask. It's too frustrating to have someone that good-looking covered up.",8,2,3,23 November 2008
Jack Reacher," disappointing
","'Jack Reacher' isn't my type of movie, so hence the middling score I gave it. This isn't to say that Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast didn't do a good job. I just think I had a misconception of the film before going in.Cruise is the mysterious, effective Jack Reacher, a man who makes promises that he can and does keep, an amazing combat fighter and one just all around tough guy. And Tom Cruise looks the part. For all the hoopla about how great he looks turning fifty, this was no glamor part for him. He's not photographed particularly lovingly, which is right for the role.Five people are shot by a sniper, and the police accuse an Army sniper with a similar history. The man is shot and in a coma, but he's able to write a name on a piece of paper: Jack Reacher. Reacher is a former Army criminal investigator.Reacher shows up but he wants to put this guy away, as he once promised he would as the Army didn't prosecute him for similar killings. If this man, Barr, summoned him, he did so because he knew Reacher would find out the truth and do the right thing. In other words, this guy has been framed.Reacher and the man's attorney (Rosalind Pike) work together looking at the victims and then trying to figure out who framed Barr and the real goal of the shootings. He realizes that these shootings were not Barr's m.o., and he soon finds himself the target of some very mean men.This is a good story, but my kind of action story are the Mission: Impossibles, the Bourne films - I will be honest and say this one was too violent, too mean, and, dare I say it -- too realistic -- for me. I like my action couched with a certain amount of suspension of belief. You do need that here for some of the shootouts, though.If this is your kind of action film, you will love it. It certainly has the acting, the production values, the hard, cold atmosphere, the car chases, the violence, and the blood. It's done very well. Being squeamish, I won't be watching it again.",6,1,4,13 July 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Tom Hanks and the Holy Grail
","Right off, I admit to not having read the book 'The Da Vinci Code' but I was familiar with the story before seeing the film. Due to the lackluster reviews this movie received, I decided to rent it rather than rush out and see it. I find sometimes that films not well received in the theater do better as rentals. I'm not sure why. It may be the shelling out of so much money to see a film nowadays. Nevertheless, I suspect I had a better experience than some people.I won't bother to repeat the story, but I am one person who did not find this film dull, lackluster, or felt like nothing was happening. I found it suspenseful and interesting, with good performances, Ian McKellan being a standout. The scenery was stunning, as was the musical score - the whole look and sound was that of a very big money production, which of course it was. I liked both Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou - Hanks never imposes himself on the material, so he didn't try to make more of the Robert Langdon character than is there - which isn't much. Just about anyone could have played the part. Hanks was the icing on an expensive cake. Audrey Tatou was very good in her role. But these parts take a back seat to the intricate and controversial story.'The Da Vinci Code' is provocative, exciting, and well done. My only complaint is that it had several of what I call false endings - i.e., you think the film is over and it isn't. I loved the true ending - once it got there.",8,2,6,26 May 2007
Titanic," Breathtaking recreation of the tragic voyage
","Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are young lovers on the doomed 'Titanic' in this 1997 film directed, written, and edited by James Cameron. The film also stars Billy Zane, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates, Francis Fisher, and Victor Garber.Rather than go into the story, I'll just say that this film is a true masterpiece, meticulously researched, designed, costumed, and acted, and gives one the feeling of the desperation, fear, sorrow, and finality that the people on the ship must have felt. The entire time I watched it, I kept thinking of the people on the planes and in the World Trade Center on 9/11.There have been several films about the Titanic but none so lovingly recreated and so powerful emotionally. Kate Winslet is exquisite as Rose, the upper class young woman engaged to a brute (Zane), who falls in love with third class passenger Jack Dawson (DiCaprio). DiCaprio is terrific - exuberant, passionate, and adventurous.If you don't know a lot about the Titanic, this movie will pique your interest. When you read more about it, you'll be impressed by Cameron's commitment to bring this piece of history to life.",10,4,5,5 September 2010
Mystic River," Three men suffer the effects of the childhood trauma of one of them
","Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon are three men who have known each other since childhood in 'Mystic River,' a 2003 film directed by Clint Eastwood and also starring Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney. When Jimmy, Sean, and Dave were boys, they were approached by a plainclothes policeman and admonished for writing in a cement sidewalk - the cop demands that they get into the car. One boy, Dave, does, and the two others watch the car go down the street. Dave is held in a cave-like room and repeatedly molested until he manages to escape. From then on, he goes through the motions of life, deeply disturbed, not dead and not alive. Jimmy's guilt and self-hatred drives him to live on crime's edge; and Sean, trying to make the world right, joins the police department, though his personal life is in ruins. When Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter is brutally murdered, the three men are re-united, as Sean is now a detective. The results are tragic.This is one of the most brilliantly acted, directed, and staggering films ever made; were it not for an unnecessarily-prolonged ending, I would have given it a 10. There is no doubt that, while he lacks the versatility and movie star aura of Johnny Depp, Sean Penn has emerged as one of our greatest American actors, giving an unforgettable performance of a tough guy crazed by grief. At times, as Jimmy controls his anger, we can literally feel him seething inside. A remarkable performance. And he's not alone. Tim Robbins delivers a characterization that is beyond shattering, fully capturing a man damaged in childhood. The brilliant script by Brian Helgeland doesn't have to tell we baby boomers and we Catholics what can easily be surmised - Dave came home to his family, they probably never spoke about what he endured, and he never got the help he needed. Kevin Bacon has the least showy role but he is no less wonderful as his character, Sean, tries to cope with a horrible case and his wife who has left him and now calls him but keeps silent on the phone. Like the childhood incident, her silence is a constant reminder of a life he lost. Marcia Gay Harden, as Dave's wife, is phenomenal as a confused, terrified woman who is totally unable to understand the man she married as he unravels. Laura Linney is Jimmy's wife whose character develops as the film goes along. She starts out as sweet and supportive; later, we see that she is a perfect match for Jimmy. There is no performance here that isn't Oscar-worthy. I should add - the hardest accents to do and sound believable are the New York and Boston accents. You can easily believe that every single actor in this production is Boston born and bred.Clint Eastwood has proved himself a first-class director and also a man who is attracted to tough material. The Boston atmosphere and depiction of these lower middle-class characters, from one who lived there and knows these people, is perfection, and the images he leaves us with are haunting. The problem - which is the same problem Eastwood had in 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' - is that he can't seem to end it. The film continues past several scenes that would have made stunning endings.'Mystic River' is a must-see. Warning: it won't leave you, not for a long, long time.",9,1,3,14 November 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," A man receives a rare gift
","Frank Capra's sometimes dark post-war film, 'It's a Wonderful Life' was released in 1946. It was intended to be released in 1947, but when a Technicolor print of 'Sinbad' couldn't be delivered on time, this film was put into release. For that reason, 'It's a Wonderful Life' - possibly the most wonderful film ever made - was overshadowed by 'The Best Years of Our Lives.' But you can't keep a great film down, and as the years have passed, 'It's a Wonderful Life' has found its place as an iconic film that means Christmas. It's survived the public domain (due to a clerical error, when the copyright was not renewed in 1974), where it was cut to ribbons and shown so often on television (and why not, networks could show it for nothing) that people were sick of it. Now that it has to be licensed again in order to be shown, the film is shown in its totality and not as often.This remarkable story of a man who sacrifices his dreams for the betterment of his community and the business his father built resonates today more than ever, when it often seems like no one cares about anything except what's in it for them. James Stewart is perfect as a caring man who swallows disappointment after disappointment and finally is ready to give up, until he is given the gift of seeing what would have happened had he never been born. No man, he learns, is poor who has friends.I can't think of a better message or anything more inspirational than can be found in this film. George Bailey is all of us, and his story is a reminder that we're all important and, no matter how tough it gets, we need to keep going. One of my favorite movies.",10,2,5,25 December 2009
Enemy at the Gates," Unrelenting
","Well, if there was ever a movie to make you sink to your knees and thank the good Lord that you weren't in Russia during WW II, this is it.  An absolutely brilliant film, unrelenting in its graphic depiction of the horrors and filth of war.  Uniformly excellent acting from all of the principals and supporting cast adds to our identification with some characters and revulsion for others.  This isn't my kind of movie, nor is it for the squeamish, but it's a fantastic film.",8,1,5,8 February 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Fun with John and Jane
","Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith,' a 2005 film also starring Vince Vaughn and Adam Brodie. The story concerns an unhappily married couple, each not knowing that the other is a special government agent. When they both go after the same target, they realize the truth. Each is then assigned to kill the other; when they find out that they are both supposed to be eliminated, they decide two are better than one.The film combines elements of 'War of the Roses,' 'F/X,' and 'True Lies.' It's interesting to see the comments so divided here. That possibly has to do with two elements: the more positive comments are from people who saw 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' as a rental or on television and the more negative are from people who saw it in the theater and paid $10; and/or: the more positive comments are from people who just like to be entertained, and the more negative are from people who like films to make sense. This is one of those films where you can't have it both ways.'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' is a fun rental with two beautiful stars who have great chemistry. The beginning is a little slow, but it picks up and then the pace is very fast. But in order to enjoy it, you have to let go of things like wanting the film to make sense. It can't - first of all, the premise is ridiculous. Secondly, in order to keep the stars alive throughout the film, the writer had to make the way the plot unfolds even more ridiculous. If you can make up your mind to just be entertained, this can be a delightful experience. There are some funny bits and some impressive action sequences. One of the funniest is when Jolie takes off in her car and Pitt tries to go after her. I found both the actors very enjoyable with great presence, and they really both light up and fire up the screen.You can always find plot holes and in this case, you'll fall into the first one and never get out. But it's a comedy. Comedies are sometimes absurd but still funny, and special effects films are sometimes absurd but still exciting. Just take 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' on its own silly merits and enjoy yourself.",8,1,3,30 December 2006
The Departed," Outstanding
","'The Departed' is a 2006 Martin Scorcese film, based on a film out of Hong Kong, 'Infernal Affairs.' I haven't seen the latter, and from reading, I can see that some people liked that film more, some less. I only know that I loved this movie; the script, the performances, and the directing style were all excellent.'The Departed' is about two men who are leading parallel lives. One, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a graduate of the police academy, and, connected from the old neighborhood, is sent undercover to infiltrate the organization of Costello (Jack Nicholson). Another graduate, Colin (Matt Damon), working with the special investigations unit, is a mob informant. Their lives connect via the police psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga), who becomes involved with DiCaprio, though she's living with Damon. Nicholson is desperate to know who his mole is and puts pressure on Damon; Special Investigations knows they have an informant and want to catch him. The situation becomes more and more tense.The cast is superb - besides di Caprio, Damon, and Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin play the top men in the special investigations unit.Scorcese does a masterful job with this film, cutting back and forth between the two men - in the hands of a less expert director, this might be confusing, but in his hands, it's not. He also builds the suspense and tension very well.Di Caprio is sensational as a hot-tempered, stressed out cop who more and more is in danger of being found out; Damon is excellent as the charming, collected Colin who, as he continues to move up in his department, comes closer to finding out the identity of Costello's mole.Martin Scorcese is no stranger to violence, and there's plenty of it to be had in 'The Departed.' It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's very strong. While I might argue with a few plot flaws, they didn't detract from me being totally absorbed in this film.",9,1,6,15 July 2009
Glory Road," entertaining
","Josh Lucas stars in 'Glory Road,' a 2006 Disney film, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.The film purports to tell the true story of Don Haskins, the basketball coach led the Texas Western Miners to a National Championship victory in 1966.From what I know, there is a lot of dramatic license taken here, though it remains an inspiring story, and the basketball game played at the championships was very exciting. Also, at the end of the film, there are interviews with the real-life players and with Haskins himself as the credits are rolling. Haskins recruited players with no regard to color, forming a team with 7 blacks and 5 white players. He wasn't the first person to have black players on a team. I think what made him stand out were the numbers and the fact that at the championship, the starters were black and everyone on the Kentucky team was white.The film shows Haskins as an extremely tough coach, and his insistence that there be no 'showboating' However, during a losing game (and I have no idea if this is true) one of the black players told Haskins that they should be allowed to play 'their game' which included some showboating, I guess. Haskins said okay and the team went on to win.In the championship game, they went up against Kentucky, coached by Ed Rupp (Jon Voight) who is portrayed as a racist. However, he went on to draft black players and is considered one of the greatest coaches in college basketball. Josh Lucas plays Haskins, and he does a great job as a tough, determined coach. He was the reason I rented this film as I liked him on his ill-fated TV show, The Firm. He really carries this movie. Jon Voight, Emily Deschanel (Haskins' wife) have small roles as the focus is on the team players. The actors on the team all did a wonderful job. The film shows the hatred and prejudice against them but also the eventual acceptance. In the film, there are problems within the team when the new players first arrived, though I understand that wasn't really the case.Like all of these underdog films, it's inspiring with exciting, moving, and dramatic moments. Recommended.",8,3,3,3 July 2015
Rosemary's Baby," Brilliant Polanski film
","No matter how one feels about Roman Polanski's personal life, one has to admit he has moments - sometimes days and months - of sheer genius. 1968's 'Rosemary's Baby' is one example. A psychological horror film, Polanski depends on the power of suggestion and elements of mystery to build the story, which is very faithful to Ira Levin's novel.It's very hard to write a review from the perspective of someone who has just seen Rosemary's Baby for the first time and has never read the book. I've seen it countless times, so I can't remember now what I thought originally. But a first-time viewer, I guess, wouldn't actually know whether Rosemary was paranoid and hysterical or, in fact, if there are really strange goings-on. This makes the story all the more potent.In the book, Rosemary isn't the frail-looking woman that Mia Farrow is, but Farrow is perfect as the fragile, passive Rosemary. Cassavetes as her actor-husband does all the actor-y things of imitating different people, etc., and is great. Of course, Ruth Gordon is a standout as nosy Minnie Castevet, every mannerism, from looking at a soup can label to dropping by with chocolate mousse, is fantastic, and she deservedly won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for her performance. Polanski called on a cast of experienced stars for the supporting roles: besides Gordon, there is Maurice Evans, Sidney Blackmer, Ralph Bellamy, Patsy Kelly, and Elisha Cook, Jr. Tony Curtis is the voice of the unfortunate actor whom Guy replaces on Broadway.Polanski sets up a compelling tale of religious conflict, ambition, terror, and isolation with the backdrop of New York City and the exterior of the famous Dakota (where John Lennon was killed) as the infamous building where Rosemary, Guy, and the Castevets live.For those who are interested, Ira Levin wrote a sequel to this, 'Rosemary's Boy,' I believe, that takes place in 1999. But for my money, nothing could ever beat 'Rosemary's Baby.'",10,1,3,19 January 2010
Jersey Boys," LOVED the music and the back story
","'Jersey Boys,' from 2014, is based on the smash hit Broadway show and directed by Clint Eastwood. He might seem an odd choice, but he's a man who loves music and is an excellent director. The only time I haven't liked one of his films was 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' - pretty awful.'Jersey Boys' tells the story of the Four Seasons, from their felonious beginnings to their attempts to break through into the music scene, their name changes, the success, and the burdens that came with it. This doesn't feel like a musical, which is one of the things I liked. The music was fabulous, and rather than have a character break into song, we see them performing. I love movies like this or an old- timer's concert because one forgets how many hits they had. I remember seeing Tom Jones in person and how each song was so familiar. The movie is a treasure trove of great music.John Lloyd Young repeats his Broadway star-making role as Frankie Valli. He is the only performer in history to win every single award given in the theater: Tony, Drama Desk, Outer Critics Circle and Theatre World Awards.He clearly understands Valli's talent, ambition, angst, and heartbreak. One of his scenes, over the song 'My Eyes Adored You' will leave you in tears. What a talent.But everyone here is top notch: Christopher Walken as Gyp DeCarlo is wonderful as a mobster who adores Frankie's voice; Erich Bergen as Bob Gaudio, Mike Doyle as Bob Crewe, Vincent Piazza as Tommy Devito, Michael Lomenda as Nick Massi - all fantastic. The end is sensational. I enjoyed every minute of 'Jersey Boys.'",8,0,0,22 November 2015
The Holiday," Big question: did I miss some gigantic special effects?
","I don't understand how a film of this nature could cost $85 million. Certainly no one expected to make money with it costing so much. At a normal budget of, say, 20 or 30 million, it would have made quite a bit.Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet play two depressed, lovelorn women who switch homes for the Christmas holiday, Diaz leaving her Los Angeles mansion for a small fairy-tale like English house and Winslet trading the English chill for a big LA lifestyle. Diaz and her live-in boyfriend have just split, and Winslet is escaping from her great love, her boss, who just announced his engagement. Both are in for surprises.'The Holiday' has a lot of warmth, likable characters, and it's a lovely Christmas movie. That's about it. There's no real pacing. Winslet is by far the more interesting actress, and she's teamed up with Jack Black, as a potential love interest and Eli Wallach, as her Oscar-winning screen writing neighbor, for the L.A. adventure - and the L.A. segments are better than the British.Diaz meets Winslet's brother, played by handsome Jude Law, and it turns out he has a secret that we don't learn until later in the film. At one point she reminds him that she's leaving in nine days. I don't know. If Jude Law were after me, I doubt I'd be going anywhere in nine days.For me this film was mildly entertaining. I'm not the demographic it's geared to, though. And I still can't understand how it cost $85 million.",6,1,5,22 March 2009

In the movie this is all traced back to the fact that his biological mother gave him up for adoption.Many people have a love/hate relationship with him, especially some of the other people at Apple: Steve Wozniak, John Scully, and Joanna Hoffman. Jobs wasn't interested in people adapting his inventions, so what he invented was something that couldn't be used with anything else. He wasn't interested in what people wanted, he was interested in his vision.He denies that his daughter Lisa is his and allows her and her mother to live on welfare and Lisa to sleep in a parka because her mother can't afford heat. Eventually some of this is resolved. The film shows us the day he launched three products: 1984, the Macintosh computer, 1988 for the NeXT computer, after he was ousted from Apple, and in 1998 for the iMAC computer.Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) sees Jobs as the broad picture man, while he is the nuts and bolts. The two are often at odds, and Wozniak doesn't feel that Steve respects him. Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) is his head of marketing. She's not afraid to tell him off. Lastly, John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) who is interested basically in what the Board and shareholders want. The main problem that I had with this film is that they never shut up I love a lot of dialogue in films, I'm from the old school, but the script just wasn't witty enough in my mind to support all the tech talk, the arguing, the yelling that went on.The other problem I had was that Jobs is so unlikable one can't connect with him. You don't get to be Steve Jobs by being Mr. Nice Guy but on the other hand, do you have to be so awful to people? I can appreciate his brilliance, his vision, both of which we've seen play out over the years in incredible products, but he was pretty rotten.Michael Fassbender is terrific as Jobs - self-absorbed, vain, arrogant, smart, and stubborn. It took me a while to realize I was looking at Kate Winslet as Joanna - she was terrific, creating a very in-depth character who had a complicated relationship with Jobs but is able to strike a chord with him regarding his family. Seth Rogen is perfect as Wozniak, a real geek, sweet, and exploding when needed. Jeff Daniels, a favorite of the writer, Aaron Sorkin's, is a shark sometimes and then other times a real friend.I like both the work of Aaron Sorkin and Danny Boyle, the director, a lot of the time and then other times, I don't. I feel as if Sorkin sometimes does too much with scenes of people speaking over one another to the point of confusion, and Boyle - well, he can be totally off the wall. I'd put this one in the middle for both of them.Great ensemble acting, a powerful story that could have been much more powerful with maybe a slightly different or opened up focus. But with such an unpleasant person, it probably wasn't worth it.",7,1,2,22 February 2016
War of the Worlds," dull
","I'm very surprised that Steven Spielberg put his name on this thing. Also, why does he use Tom Cruise so much? I won't go through the story. Aliens invade earth, using machines they have hidden below ground for I don't know how long. Everybody goes on the run, and the focus is on one particular family, headed up by Tom Cruise, a divorced man taking care of his young, constantly screaming, hysterical daughter (Dakota Fanning) and his older son who apparently pays no attention to anything his father tells him.The beginning of this adaptation of the H.G. Wells story was quite good, if you overlooked certain things. I mean, an entity that can evaporate people must be also able to evaporate their clothes. I'm in no way a special effects expert, so I was pretty impressed with the effects in the beginning.My problem with this movie is that within thirty minutes, I lost interest.If you move fast and keep an audience entertained with a strong script, good acting, good direction, and good pace, no one will care about the fact that some cars work and others don't, that a videocamera works when everything else doesn't, that a few miles out of town, no one knows about this catastrophe and there is no alien activity - etc. But when you give an audience time to think, they consciously or subconsciously start picking up inconsistencies which gives them a perfect excuse to criticize it.And what a cop out - to have Morgan Freeman's voice explain the ending.My real problem is that a great artist like Steven Spielberg should know better. This movie could have grossed more than however many millions it did by having a little more attention paid to it, rather than saying, okay, we've got Cruise, we've got Spielberg, let's throw this thing on the screen, sit back, and let the idiots pay for it.",5,1,3,1 December 2014
Love Actually," Enjoyable holiday film
","Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney and Colin Firth all experience 'Love Actually,' a shortened form of a phrase, 'love actually is all around,' as stated by Hugh Grant in the opening narration. This 2003 film, well directed by Richard Curtis, isn't a typical romantic comedy. It concerns all kinds of love...and while love actually is all around, sometimes things don't work out as we hoped.As you might guess from the formidable list of stars, the film is somewhat episodic. Liam Neeson plays a man who has just lost his wife and now has to deal with his withdrawn son; Laura Linney is an assistant in love with her boss, but personal problems get in the way; Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are a long married couple, and now he finds himself being seduced by an office tramp; Hugh Grant is the new prime minister who falls for someone on his staff...etc. There are some adorable stories: Neeson and his son plotting to get a goddess to notice the boy at school...hilarious stories: Bill Nighy as a washed up singer who promotes one of his old songs that has been changed with Christmas lyrics; a young man who can't get a date is sure if he goes to America, his accent will bring in women by the droves; and some sadness - something for everyone. What hooks all the stories together is the theme of love.There is a good deal of fantasy in the film - it's meant to be fun, light and sweet, and it succeeds. I didn't read the other reviews, but from some of the posters, I gather there were viewers who wanted something deeper. For me it's always best to take a film as intended and not wish for more. Surely Curtis had no expectation of heavy-duty story and character development when he utilized so many stories. The great soundtrack adds to the festivities. It's an ultimate feel-good movie, and it's the favorite film of many, including the person who sent it to me as a gift.",8,0,2,16 November 2007
12 Years a Slave," powerful story of man's inhumanity to man
","It's hard to express the emotional impact of this film, starring the Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Lupita Nyong'o, Alfre Woodward, Benedict Cumberbatch, Brad Pitt, and Paul Giamatti.Eliofor plays Solomon Northrup, in the true story of a free black man living in the north who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. It's a brutal story. You see these people treated like merchandise, separated from their children, and the cruelty of the land managers.Northrup at first is pretty lucky -- he is sold to one of the more humane landowners, Ford (Cumberbatch), who takes advantage of the fact that Northrop is an excellent musician and reads the Bible to them on Sundays. As Cumberbatch points out, though, Ford isn't a nice guy -- he like the rest of them use slaves as their economy is dependent upon it. What's even worse about Ford is that he has no control over his horrid manager.In order to keep Northrop from being killed by said manager, Ford sells him to another owner, Edwin Epps (Fassbender), a complete nightmare who is taking sexual advantage of one of his slaves, Patsy (Lupita Nyong'o) and enjoys being mean. His wife is jealous of Patsy and also makes her life a living hell.All of the performances are excellent, and this movie was filmed in Louisiana and is gorgeous to look at, belying the sadness and horror.Great movie.",10,6,11,22 February 2014
There Will Be Blood," big movie with great performance by Daniel Day-Lewis
","'There Will Be Blood' is a 2007 film directed by P.T. Anderson and starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano.It's the story of an oil tycoon, starting out in the early days of the century and going through to about 1929.Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview, and in the beginning, we see him searching for oil with a team of men. I have to inject something here: what I loved about the beginning was the lack of dialogue. Whenever we see westerns or pioneer films or whatever, characters speak as we do today. However, I believe that miners, trappers, traders, gunslingers et al. didn't do much talking, in fact, they were probably just one or two steps up from neanderthals, without much education, and living somewhat isolated lives. The beginning of this film captured this beautifully as the men worked side by side, saying very little.Plainview becomes wealthy - he seems charming as he travels around with his son H.W. (Dillon Freasier) but he's out to get land as cheaply as he can, and he makes promises he doesn't keep. He ultimately comes up against the Sunday family, whose land he buys, but one of the sons is a preacher, Eli (Dano), and the two come into conflict immediately.There's not much plot here; it's the story of a morally bankrupt man who becomes more and more morally bankrupt and richer as time goes on, more of a drunk, and more isolated. He abandons H.W. after he goes deaf as the result of an accident, but he's shamed into retrieving him by Eli making him confess his sins in church before he's baptized - the price Plainview has to pay in order to get the Bandy land, the last holdout.The film is propelled by the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, the young gay lad of My Beautiful Laundrette, the star of My Left Foot, Lincoln, the hunk in Last of the Mohicans - the man's range is unbelievable. He gives a terrifying performance. Like his performance did in Gangs of New York, Day-Lewis scared the hell out of me as this volatile man who would just as soon kill you as talk to you. It's searing, it's gut-wrenching and ultimately devastating.Without an actor of his caliber, I can't see this film being successful - it's too long, for one thing, and there's just not that much story. Paul Dano is very good. I've read that some felt he wasn't dynamic or charismatic enough as the preacher, but I think the point was to be very different from Plainview in personality.All in all, worth it for Daniel Day-Lewis, as are most films in which he appears.",8,1,2,7 July 2013
To Kill a Mockingbird," an amazing film
","It's hard to express what an emotional experience seeing this movie was for me. How something done so simply can be so profound is beyond my limited abilities, but that's what 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is, a simple, beautiful film with profound messages. It takes one back in time, to 1932 - and you don't for a minute doubt that you're there, in a small southern town. It shows us, through the eyes of imaginative and energetic children, what life was like. It also shows us a great man, Atticus Finch, and demonstrates through action the values with which this widower has raised his children: by the respect he shows his black housekeeper, in his taking of a controversial case involving the alleged rape of a white woman by a black man, and in the way he tells them what his father said, that it's wrong to kill a mockingbird, because they are only on earth to give joy and harm nothing and no one.The acting, of course, from top to bottom, is superb. The children - Mary Badham, Philip Alford, and John Megna, are perfect. Brock Peters gives a marvelous, sympathetic performance as the defendant. Gregory Peck delivers the performance of his lifetime in the role of anyone's lifetime.I'm glad to see that TCM has this film in its educational package for schools, because it should be seen by everyone.There are tough lessons in this world, Atticus points out. One of the toughest is one of the messages in this film, that it's not the Boo Radleys of the world we need to fear. Evil is, as Edmund Burke said, when good men do nothing. Atticus Finch wasn't one of them.",10,1,4,4 January 2006
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Madness
","Alec Guiness and his men are ordered to build 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' in this magnificent 1957 film starring Alec Guinness, William Holden, Sessue Hayakawa, and Jack Hawkins, and directed by David Lean. Lean manages to give us an epic that manages to focus on fascinating and multilayered characters.The story is based on a book about a real-life incident; however, in order to make the points made in the film, the story has many fictional elements, including the depiction of Colonel Saito (Hayakawa), who was actually a very humane Japanese officer, and he and the real-life Colonel Nicholson (Guinness), actually named Toosey shared a great respect. In the movie, Saito demands that the British officers in a prisoner of war camp participate in the building a bridge across the river Kwai in Burma during World War II. Colonel Nicholson refuses, and despite harsh imprisonment, will not give in. When his demands are met, he becomes determined to show the superiority of the British army and engineering in the building of the bridge. The bridge becomes an end in itself, although it will actually help the Japanese.William Holden plays an escaped prisoner who is asked to return to the Burmese jungle to help destroy the bridge and the train that is supposed to go over it.Alec Guinness gives his greatest performance as Nicholson - and that's saying something, since he did so many great ones. He has the stoicism, the determination, and the pride necessary for the role, contrasted with the frailty of his imprisonment. One really believes he has endured harsh imprisonment, given the way he looks, talks, and walks. Holden is fabulous as the soldier who, once he gets away, just wants to go home and is forced to go back to the jungle. In one scene, he yells at Major Warden (Jack Hawkins): 'You and Colonel Nicholson, you're two of a kind, crazy with courage. For what? How to die like a gentleman... how to die by the rules - when the only important thing is how to live like a human being.' Sessue Hayakawa does a brilliant job as a man as determined as Nicholson and furious that he cannot bend him to his will.The end of the film is extremely suspenseful and builds tension throughout. This is a great film, and an antiwar one - Colonel Nicholson tells Saito that as he ages, he thinks about what his life has meant. Sometimes our goals become confused, and one forgets the real focus. The final line, uttered by Lt. Joyce (Geoffrey Horne) says it all.",10,1,4,2 March 2009
A Hard Day's Night," Influential, like the Beatles themselves
","I was part of the Beatles generation, a freshman in high school when they came to America. You couldn't help but get mixed up with them whether you liked them or not. They were everywhere. Everything about them was special to teenage girls: their accents, the British colloquialisms, their clothes - it was indeed a British invasion.The Beatles would go on to have many peaks of popularity because they and their music evolved. A Hard Day's Night was done at their first 'peak' (but let's face it, they didn't have much non-peak time). Frankly, it's a work of genius, as far as I'm concerned. The Beatles here are the '60s version of the Marx Brothers and completely natural, funny, crazy, strange, and uniquely talented. The movie is a day in the life of the Fab Four, with lots and lots of their music intertwined. The writer, Alun Owen, followed the Beatles on their French tour and put the script together based on his observations. He tagged John as a smart aleck, Paul as cute but practical, George as quiet, and Ringo as kind of slow. He also worked to get their speech and daily routines into the script. When they went to film it, the Beatles did a lot of improvisation, some of which was incorporated after the film.It's a black and white movie, using jump shots, which were quite new, and it really set the stage for other musical movies to come.Seeing A Hard Day's Night today, it was an innocent time in general and for the Beatles, who were still pretty provincial. They were exuberant in their fame; that would change later. Unlike some other groups, where people played in a band and went their separate ways, the Beatles were always together, it seemed, at least in the beginning.One piece of trivia: On the night they appeared on Ed Sullivan, John Lennon appeared in the dressing room of Mitzi McCall and Charlie Brill, who also performed though they couldn't hear a word the other was saying because of the screaming fans. The Coke machine was in the Brill-McCall dressing room. John came in, got a Coke, and sat down and talked to Charlie Brill. As he talked, he drew something on a napkin and signed it. Then he left. 'What a pompous jerk,' Brill said -- and tossed the napkin in the wastebasket.Charlie Brill now knows that was a big mistake. They were no flash in the pan. They were the Beatles and they just got better and better. This movie captures them and London at a moment in time with the screaming fans, the music, and the excitement about the Beatles that I'll always remember.",9,0,0,4 June 2014
Whiplash," who knew
","Many of us have watched J.K. Simmons sail through film and television for years. And to think, all this time he had this kind of ability. It reminds me of Melvyn Douglas, second banana in dozens and dozens of films, playing similar roles, and then suddenly becoming one of the greatest actors of our time with Hud and I Never Sang for My Father.Miles Teller and Simmons star in 'Whiplash,' from 2014 and, no surprise to anyone, Simmons took home the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. He plays Fletcher, a sociopathic, manipulative instructor in a music conservatory who abuses his students psychologically. Teller plays a young man. Andrew, who wants to be a great percussionist, better than any of them, including Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker. He tolerates the abuse and becomes arrogant with success, only to be humiliated by Fletcher. It is a deep psychological battle of wills.If you haven't seen the film, you will not believe the lengths that Andrew goes to in order to be on stage as first drummer.There's a nice turn here by Paul Reiser as Andrew's father.Having been a musician myself and having been psychologically abused by several teachers, I can tell you that this kind of torture is terribly destructive. The only survivors are people who are driven and willing to give everything they have to their music at the expense of everything and everybody else. Is Andrew one of them? You'll have to decide for yourself.Great soundtrack, powerful acting from Teller and Simmons -- this low- grossing film proved to be a real winner.",10,2,4,3 December 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," disappointing
","I asked IMDb to show male versus female reviewers, and though I can't say I studied it with a magnifying glass, it seemed to me that men in general liked this film and women hated it.I'm a woman, and I hated it.Here's why. It's too long. I don't think packing a film full of nudity, sex, and foul language make a film important. Let me say right up front, I don't have a problem with any of it in a film, but to me, this film wasn't much else. And if I can be blunt, Martin Scorsese's presence doesn't make a film important either. He has done some films that are magnificent and some that leave me cold. This leaves me cold.Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the finest actors of his generation, and I love him in everything, including in this as Jordan Belfort, a high living stock broker and con artist. He gives a fabulous performance. All the performances are good, and the cast is top notch. It includes Matthew McConaughey, Jonah Hill, Rob Reiner, Kyle Chandler, and Joanna Lumley, to name a few.I loved a few things in this movie, though it did not hold my interest for three hours. The scenes trying to get the money into Switzerland were priceless, the infomercial was fabulous, the scene in the boat during the bad weather, fantastic. Scorsese builds a lot of humor into this and views the chicanery of these jerks through a lens where they look like buffoons.This is based on a true story, so Jordan Belfort keeps on making money. He got a million for the film rights and paid back $21,000 to his investors who are owed $200 million. He isn't paying anyone back. But I guess he has the Midas touch, and he can count Scorsese as his latest con.",4,10,28,29 March 2014
Die Hard with a Vengeance," frightening for all the wrong reasons
","Unfortunately I just saw this film.  I don't want to put in a spoiler so I'll just say - recent events make watching this movie terrifying and spooky, mostly because of the film's use of location.  One scene in particular today takes on new meaning.  It's interesting how the minute you put something on film, you date it so that even a few years later, it has ramifications beyond its original intent.  Watch this if you dare and you'll see what I mean.  As an entry into the 'Die Hard' series, it's very good - Bruce Willis is always attractive and can keep a film going, and Jeremy Irons is an excellent villain.  But the real villain here is history.",7,1,2,9 February 2003
"Hail, Caesar!"," Oh, the humanity!
","The Coen Brothers have given us some wonderful black comedies and dramas -- among them, some of my favorites: No Country for Old Men, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, the Hudsucker Proxy,etc. I was so excited to see them tackling old Hollywood again as they did in Barton Fink.What a letdown.The story is a day in the life of Eddie Mannix. Eddie Mannix was a real person, Louis B. Mayer's 'fixer'. He has been played in the past by Bob Hoskins and Barney Martin. His wife, Toni, was the girlfriend of George 'Superman' Reeves until he broke it off. Unfortunately, a day in the life of Eddie Mannix is episodic, with problems solved off-screen. Some of it is amusing. With the exception of a 30-second scene with Frances McDormand, none of it is laugh out loud funny. It's a shame because there were some fine performances from Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Alden Ehrenreich, and Tilda Swinton.The old Hollywood is beautifully replicated. We have a Spartacus- type, w film going on, starring Baird Whitlock (George Clooney, who looks dreadful) who is kidnapped by Communists and held for ransom. Johansson is an Esther Williams type, and we see women doing a water ballet while the character rises from the water in what looks like a big champagne glass. Instead of a huge smile and extending her arms a la Esther, she looks very tentative. There's a Gene Kelly-Sinatra type film about sailors that has a cute musical number by Channing Tatum, whom I guess is supposed to be a gay Communist; and finally, a period piece that a western star (Alden Ehrenreich) is thrust into, walking bowlegged and talking with a twang. Fiennes is the director, Laurence Laurentz, who attempts to coach him. Tilda Swinton plays columnist sisters, fighting for exclusives.So fixer Eddie has to get Baird Whitlock back, fix Johansson's problem, calm Fiennes - it's a major drag. It would have been better to concentrate on the film Hail, Caesar and take out the stupid Communist plot.This film had so much potential, but it goes NOWHERE. And by the way, it contains an old wives' tale - someone says that Mannix saved a major star involved in a hit and run by hushing it up, and the person he hit did six months in prison for him. That's supposed to be Clark Gable, and the story is dead wrong. If you want the real story, go to snopes.com - it's a fascinating dissection going back to the original article, which states that Clark Gable rammed his car into a tree on Howard Strickling's law.How the story evolved is actually more fun than this movie.",6,2,4,1 August 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," stupid
","I want to just say, I watched this film at the suggestion of someone I thought had better taste than he does. I can't tell you how shocked I was when I realized that this is what he considers a comedy. Unsophisticated, low comedy, and dumb, with a really good cast - Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Steve Carrell, Paul Rudd, Vince Vaughan, Fred Willard -- but they were all let down by a really rotten script.There were a couple of funny things - my favorite was everyone singing Afternoon Delight in harmony. If only the rest of the film had been like that.So you might ask, so what do you consider funny? Well, 'What about Bob?', both 'La Cage aux Folles' and 'Birdcage' for different reasons, lots of comedies in the '80s like 'Money Pit,' 'Night Shift,' Billy Wilder, Howard Hawks, Preston Sturges. I even liked 'Starsky and Hutch.' Low comedy like 'Anchorman' just isn't my thing.",1,10,18,14 September 2013
American Gangster," excellent film by Ridley Scott
","'American Gangster' from 2007 purports to be the story of drug lord Frank Lucas. My understanding is that it's about 1 percent accurate. However, the film, though long, is an excellent study of pervasive corruption.The cast includes Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Ruby Dee, and Ted Levine (from Monk).Washington plays Frank Lucas, a criminal who is determined to make it big in the drug trade. He flies to Thailand and arranges to have 100% heroin shipped to him, cutting out the middleman, and also putting the Mafia out of business. He calls the heroin 'Blue Magic.'He brings his family up from the south and has them working for him in various fronts - auto shop, dry cleaner, etc., but what they're doing is selling heroin.There is some discrepancy about how the heroin was shipped. In the film, it is as Lucas himself said, false bottoms in the coffins of dead soldiers. But someone else said it was in furniture. Lucas has so many cops on the take -- he's involved three-quarters of the narcotics squad, the main cop being Detective Trupo (Brolin), a real greedy guts.In the beginning of the film, we see the rise of Lucas and on the other side, how a special force was assembled to stop the sale of a drug called Blue Magic, which is Lucas' drug. The lead officer is Richie Roberts, who, with his partner, found $1 million in a drug bust. When Roberts wants to turn the money over to the evidence room, his partner tells him that if he does that, no one will work with him - they'll think he can't be trusted and will report them. Unreal. But Richie turns in the money and is given the management of the new force and told to choose only people he can trust. Roberts ultimately passed the bar exam and became an attorney.The real Roberts criticized Washington's portrayal of Lucas, saying he came off as 'almost noble.' Not to me he didn't. Roberts says that he was vicious, violent, illiterate. It's true that Washington did not play Lucas as illiterate. But in depicting his violence and viciousness, not acting overtly violent works better on film. Washington throughout seems reserved, somewhat soft-spoken, so that when he loses his temper, it's terrifying.Though long, 'American Gangster' doesn't really feel long and is an absorbing film with interesting character studies. Dirty, corrupt cops are all over TV and movies. I have a feeling they may be all over our police departments too.",8,1,2,14 March 2016
Stranger Than Fiction," fun, poignant, and quirky
","Will Ferrell is an IRS auditor living a life that is 'Stranger than Fiction' -- in fact, it is fiction -- in this 2006 film also starring Emma Thompson,Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah.Ferrell is Harold Crick, a smart auditor who lives his life on a strict schedule and leads a sterile life. One day he starts hearing a voice narrating what he's doing. He appears to be the only one hearing it. It upsets and annoys him, so he sees a psychiatrist (Linda Hunt) who sends him to a literary professor (Hoffman). The professor says the first thing to decide is if he's in a comedy or a tragedy. Crick is sent to audit a bakery owner, Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal), and the two end up falling for one another.Elsewhere, a well-known author (Thompson) is sent an assistant (Latifah) by her publisher because she needs help finishing her book. Her character, Harold Crick, needs to be killed off, and she can't figure out how to do it.Meanwhile, the narrator in Harold's head reveals that he's going to die, and Crick recognizes the narrator's voice on a TV interview. Learning the name of the author, he sets out to find her to ask her to change her book.Wonderful story of a man learning to live just at the point he's going to be killed off, and it's filled with humor, sweet moments, and poignancy. Author's characters coming to life is not a new plot, but the way 'Stranger than Fiction' is handled is very fresh.A terrific cast doesn't hurt -- Will Ferrell isn't always fabulous, but he pulls off Harold Crick very well. Maggie Gyllenhaal as the defiant baker who doesn't mind paying taxes but won't pay any taxes toward defense, is wonderful - hostile and later caring and sweet. Thompson is one of the finest actresses around. As a woman in the midst of artistic crisis, tortured by trying to bring her book to a close, she gives a strong performance. Her best scene is in the hospital -- she's there because she needs to be in touch with death for her book -- and she asks a nurse where the people who are going to die are. 'These people are injured,' she complains with a straight face, 'and they'll be okay after you help them. Where do you keep the people who are going to die?' Hoffman and Latifah in supporting roles are excellent, both bringing humor to the situation.Definitely worth seeing with a fine script by Zach Helm and good direction by Mark Forster.",8,1,2,12 January 2013
The Green Mile," overwhelming
","This knockout of a movie is the best of the Stephen King 'morality' films such as the wonderful 'Shawshank Redemption' and the TV versions of 'The Stand' and 'Storm of the Century'.  'Green Mile' manages to inspire and devastate at the same time.  The casting is interesting, utilizing such actors as Bonnie Hunt and Dabbs Greer brilliantly and everyone performs with warmth and deep feeling.  Hanks, of course, is the glue.  Michael Clarke Duncan is powerful in his simplicity.  This is a film that will never leave me.",10,0,3,19 June 2000
The Reader," Evil often has a human face
","Directed by Stephen Daldry and written by David Hare, 'The Reader' is a thought-provoking and surprising drama that takes the viewer in several different directions. Though some reviewers on this site are critical of Daldry and the film, in lesser hands, 'The Reader' would be a total, erratic mess.The story is told in flashback as the adult Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) remembers his youth. As a 15-year-old boy, the young Michael (David Kross) has his first forays into sex with an older woman, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) in 1958 Berlin. She helps him when he winds up on her doorstep, ill with scarlet fever; he returns to thank her when he's well. The two enter into a sexual relationship. As part of their time together, Hanna has Michael read to her. One day, Hanna simply disappears. The next time Michael sees her is in 1966, when he is a law student in Heidelberg and his class travels to watch a trial. It is then he realizes not one secret that Hanna carried with her, but two.'The Reader' is, above all, a very human story of real, conflicted human beings, and the brilliant performances reflect this. David Kross is exceptional as the young Michael, in the throes of first, blinding passion, who, in the face of the truth about the woman he loved, endeavors to understand her nonetheless. Kate Winslet is magnificent, and that's the only word for her. Hardened by life and her unsentimental and uncompromising view of the world, she is cut off from people due to a secret she considers shameful. With Michael she allows herself some softness, and gives in to not only passion but emotion, sobbing when Michael reads a sad story to her. Winslet shows us all of this, her need to connect with someone, and her strict view of life. Ralph Fiennes turns in another excellent performance; Michael's world and his own isolation were shaped by Hanna. As an adult, he still grapples with a decision he made and his own guilt; he still tries to understand not only her but how he could love her, and in the midst of all of these complex emotions, he believes he owes her something. He ends up giving her the greatest gift he could - her dignity.As with 'Dead Man Walking,' there is more to a person than his or her actions, reprehensible though they may be. We are not, after all, what we do but who we are. While some crimes are unforgivable, there is, shockingly, at times a connection with the perpetrator that allows us to see the person and extend a consideration that person never gave another. Thus murderers have loving parents and family, and someone who showed inhumanity to others has a little humanity shown them.A very remarkable story.",9,0,0,27 May 2009

","I agree with some of the reviews, that 'Dark Shadows' director Tim Burton didn't know if he was doing a camp comedy, a horror film, a romance, or a drama.He would have been best to go with the camp comedy in this 2012 film, since that comes off the best. Loved Barnabas experiencing McDonald's and television and thinking the Carpenters worked with wood. I loved the 1972 settings and references. And I loved the soundtrack.There are lots of special effects here, some are fun, some just aren't. I saw this as a rental and I think it probably comes off much better as a rental.Johnny Depp is sheer perfection, so serious, so intense, you can't help but laugh at some of his line deliveries.The rest of the performances are fine, but Depp is fabulous.Depp obviously loves working with Burton and vice versa, but let's face it, not all of their work together is inspired. This film is based on a flimsy script that could have been so much better, if only Burton had decided on which way he wanted to go. The comedy stuff was great.",6,1,1,16 July 2013
Hitch," A date movie that's lots of fun
","Will Smith is 'Hitch,' a love doctor of sorts who counsels men on how to get the woman of their dreams. He's very successful but stays out of relationships himself. Then he meets the beautiful Sara (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist, and starts to fall in love himself.This is a very well done movie. Smith is utterly charming and likable as a sincere man who creates opportunities for men who otherwise might not meet anyone, let alone a dream girl. One such man is Albert, madly in love with a Paris Hilton type, Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), who has all of her investments at the accounting firm where he works. After a lot of coaching from Hitch, Albert gets his chance with Allegra. One of the funniest scenes in the film is Hitch showing Albert how to dance - except Albert seems himself as an expert. Another great scene is Hitch teaching Albert the ins and outs of the kiss at the door.Not only did I think Hitch had some great advice, I think it is a fine film with some very good performances, particularly by Smith and a toned-down Kevin James. They are very well directed here. Eva Mendes does a terrific job as a reporter who becomes Hitch's love interest, who herself is trying to track down this love doctor after what she perceives as wrong advice hurt her good friend. A very funny script. Highly recommended.",8,1,2,12 May 2007
Ray," The warts and all bio of a music great
","A masterful performance by Jamie Foxx is just one of the highlights of 'Ray,' a 2004 film also starring Kerry Washington, Regina King, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Sharon Warren, Patrick Bachau, and many others, all giving excellent support to the film.The film has several main focuses: the first is Charles' childhood - the drowning of his brother George which haunted him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him, and the strength taught him by his mother - don't bend, don't break, don't ever be a cripple. She eventually sends him to a special school where Charles' gift of music is discovered. The next focus is Charles' artistic evolution as a Nat King Cole-like singer, to his arrangements of gospel music, his foray into country music, and the unique sound that became Ray Charles. The third focus is Charles' personal life - his marriage to Bea, his many affairs, his heroin addiction and eventual rehabilitation.Because Charles lived a packed 74 years, there's a lot skipped. Though Charles was orphaned while in his teens, the death of his beloved mother, his rock, isn't in the film. While he is shown on the chitlin circuit and refusing to play in segregated clubs, his near-starvation as a musician isn't covered. At one point, he found a jar of jelly and attempted to eat it, but the jar broke. He was that down and out. Bea is shown with him when the State of Georgia, which banned him, adopts 'Georgia on My Mind' as their theme song in 1979 and welcomes Charles back to his native state, yet he and Bea were divorced in 1977 which isn't mentioned. She probably was there, however. Also, she wasn't his only wife - he was married once before he met her; that marriage isn't covered. In the movie, we're told of one illegitimate child - there were 12. It would have been impossible to get all of that and more into a film.What isn't skipped is his glorious music, which seems to go on constantly throughout the film, continually reinforcing his genius and artistry.Charles' story is compelling and holds the audience's interest throughout. Those who scoff at it as a made-for-TV movie don't give it the credit it deserves. Taylor Hackford's direction gives 'Ray' a good pace, and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the various decades beautifully.As Ray, Jamie Foxx inhabits the character and makes one forget he's a comedian playing a part. Foxx wore prosthetics, did his own piano playing, and spent a great deal of time with Charles preparing for the role. He nails him, but it's not an impersonation - he's a flesh and blood man with hallucinations of standing in water and finding his brother's body; a man full of denial about his addiction, hating the word junkie and believing he's not hooked; and he's in denial about his home life, thinking that his wife doesn't know about his various affairs and illegitimate children (in the movie, child); and a man taken terrible advantage of early in his career because of his blindness who refuses to be walked on later on. He demands to be paid in $1 bills so they can be counted; when he discovers he's a gravy train for a club owner and her partner and was nearly cheated out of a record deal, he makes his own deal and leaves his job.One doesn't so much marvel at Foxx's performance as accept him as Ray from the first time he appears on camera.This is an excellent biography, which, like 'Walk the Line' is punctuated with the fantastic music of the artist. Whether or not you're a Ray Charles fan, 'Ray' is something to experience.",9,0,2,1 April 2007
Inception," What is reality...what is a dream
","'Inception' is a 2010 film that stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy, and Tom Berenger.Since so many people have seen and are seeing this film and have reviewed it, I won't rehash the story.I found it an extremely well acted, fascinating, suspenseful film, and I loved the concept of going into the subconscious dream state, and the idea of dream vs. reality and which is which.The best thing about this film for me is that, as a classic film aficionado and not being an expert at things like wormhole movies, parallel realities, etc., I actually could follow this one without having to go to the IMDb board or look online to find out what the heck it was about. After Mulholland Drive, I spent hours on the Internet, and then I had to watch it again. A great film but man was I lost.I'm sure this sounds funny to many young IMBb members, who see this kind of film all the time, but this Casablanca fan gets confused easily. For that, I thank writer/director Christopher Nolan, whose scripts for 'The Prestige,' 'Memento,' and 'Batman Begins,' I absolutely loved. He's really a favorite.Another favorite of mine is the ever-boyish Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a wonderful actor and gives a great performance in his role, ably supported by the always excellent Marion Cotillard, Cillian Murphy (a new favorite), and the rest of the cast.Someone somewhere who hated this movie said that anyone who thought Nolan was trying to say something serious is crazy. I don't know if he was or not, but I think the whole subject of the subconscious and the dream state and creating a reality are intriguing topics. Many do question is our whole reality on earth is a dream. Not sure 'Inception' really answers that, but it's an absorbing film.",10,2,15,16 January 2011
Murder on the Orient Express," gorgeous-looking with stupid additions and one UNACCEPTABLE omission
","Kenneth Branagh and and all-star cast ride the Orient Express in 'Murder on the Orient Express,' a remake of the magnificent 1974 film. The stars, besides Branagh, are Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Judy Dench, Penelope Cruz, Daisy Ridley, and Leslie Odom, Jr.For those who don't know the story, it concerns the murder on the Orient Express, which is stalled out due to an avalanche. Poirot is asked to investigate and finds many clues and many anomalies.The care taken with the cinematography, the costumes, the performances, the interior settings of the train, all went out the window when the screenwriter failed to deliver. First off, we have Hercules Poirot, who looks ridiculous, solving an unrelated case, then talking to a picture of his beloved Katherine. Who the hell is she? Why was this added?Also, if you know the story, it's possibly more interesting than if you don't. One thing I will say, unlike others, is that the film didn't seem boring to me or my sisters. I imagine you'll find that complaint from younger people, but I could be wrong.I could have put up with anything, but when a script introduces a clue and Poirot doesn't pick up on - uh, we have a problem. The problem is sloppy writing. On the night that Ratchit was killed, a disturbance is heard, and the porter knocks on the door to see if he's all right. He answers in French. Here he says, 'It's nothing.' In the original film, he says, 'cauchemar' (nightmare). Why tell us that and then have one of the characters say that Ratchit didn't speak a word of French, if Poirot wasn't going to realize a) he didn't answer; and b) someone else was in his room. But that clue is never brought up. No, these writers can't be bothered with a petty detail like that.Branagh is a youngish, attractive Poirot with an absurd mustache - although he is good, it's not enough, and he's not Poirot. It's always a pleasure to see people like Jacobi, Colman, Pfeiffer. It's a good cast, but the original cast was on a consistently higher level with Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Vanessa Redgrave, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery - I could go on but you get the point. With its extraneous story details and lack of wit, I'm giving this a 6. Hollywood, come up with something original.",6,2,5,1 December 2017
Defiance," impressive
","I will take my cue from one of the reviews on this board by a man who clearly knows his history and say that 'Defiance' was inspired by a true story. Apparently it's not totally accurate. Very few historical films are, because the writers have to take so much dramatic license.The film stars Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber as the two oldest Bielski brothers, who are Polish Jews (although I think in the film they're Russians). Zus (Schreiber) and his little brother (Asael) watch in hiding as the Nazis go through West Belarus. They run to their parents' home, only to find them dead and the youngest brother Aaron (George MacKay) hiding. They all go into the Lipiczanska Forest and reconnect with the oldest, Tuvia (Daniel Craig). They know the forest very well.Gradually their numbers grow as they find other Jews hiding. They have to steal food from farms, and when they kill Nazis who attack them, they steal their guns. They also blew up trains, with the aim of saving Jews. Twelve thousand of them survive, living in the forest for over two years.Apparently during war crimes hearings, the Russians tried to blame the Bielski group for involvement in a massacre of Polish civilians conducted in Nalibok. However, investigation into the event turned up no evidence at all that the Bielskis were involved.The group had to move from time to time but finally were able to set up a more robust and stable community.Forgetting the inaccuracies and just looking at it as a story, it's a powerful one with tremendous acting by Craig, Schreiber, and the other actors. Directed by Edward Zwick, it moves at a good pace and is beautifully photographed. Though one can't really get the feeling of what it must have been like to leave your home and live in the woods, you were able to see that it was a tremendous hardship.Very good film, a story of strength, hope, and survival.",7,0,1,30 November 2013
Lord of War," just remember - he never sold to Osama Bin Laden
","Nicholas Cage stars with Jared Leto, Ethan Hawke, Ian Holm, and Bridget Moynahan in 'The Lord of War,' a 2005 film directed and written by Andrew Niccol.Cage plays Yuri Orlov, who comes from the Ukraine with his family and settles in Brooklyn. He goes on to become the biggest arms dealer in the world, with the law (Ethan Hawke) on his trail, constantly trying to get something on him. Yuri has everything - money, the woman of his dreams (Moynahan), a son, and a thriving business. But as he says himself, 'There are two types of tragedies in life. One is not getting what you want, the other is getting it.' The main character is based on a real-life arms dealer, Viktor Bout, who was finally arrested in 2008 during a sting operation and convicted in Manhattan in 2011 of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens.Despite its chilling subject matter, 'Lord of War' manages to be funny at times, with brilliant dialogue -- and no easy answers. Narrated by the main character, we see the violence, the terror, the politics, and the corruption all around war and arms deals. Yuri tells us, 'I never sold to Osama Bin Laden. Not on moral grounds, it's just that his checks kept bouncing back then.' How it's possible to make any part of this film funny, I don't know, but Niccol gives us some great lines to remember. The humor is mostly in the beginning; later on, the film becomes deadly serious, almost like Yuri himself. It starts with selling a gun in his room for extra money; later, he's sitting with heads of countries.As the cynical Yuri, Nicholas Cage is fabulous and makes you like him despite his profession and the fact that he starts down a slippery slope and keeps sliding. Jared Leto does a fantastic job as his coked-up brother and partner Vitaly, who, when faced with the reality of what they're doing, has feelings about it not entertained by Yuri. Yuri remains detached; it takes the drug addict to see arming so-called 'freedom fighters' for what it is.A very different kind of movie, beautifully acted and produced, that gives one a lot of food -- and ammunition -- for thought.",8,2,2,11 April 2013
The Good Shepherd," A man's career overtakes his life
","Matt Damon stars in 'The Good Shepherd,' a 2006 film directed by Robert de Niro. It also stars Angelina Jolie, Michael Gambon, Tammy Blanchard, Alec Baldwin, Joe Pesci, and Billy Crudup. Damon is Edward Wilson, who is the head of CIA covert operations during the Bay of Pigs. It looks as though Castro was tipped off, and it's up to Wilson to find the leak. While doing so, Wilson flashes back over his life, which includes his father's suicide, a college professor (Gambon) who figures into his life later, the exclusive Skull & Bones club he belonged to at Yale, his own recruitment into the OSS, a quick marriage that cost him his true love (Blanchard), his long-distance marriage, and the lack of relationship with his son. Finally, in the present, he's faced with an agonizing decision.The performances are all good, and the film's flipping from the past to the present and back again is interesting and well done. It's a dark movie, with the introverted performance of Damon hanging over it. He's really terrific; he underplays, and you feel the solitary nature of the man and the feelings seething inside him. Only occasionally do they emerge, and his performance makes those bigger scenes all the more powerful.De Niro has assembled a wonderful cast, all of whom have outstanding moments. Jolie as Edward's alcoholic wife is effective; Blanchard is heartbreaking as Edward's true love; Gambon is his usual excellent self as a professor with a few secrets. But at the core is Damon himself. As a young man, he could have gone the Matthew McConnaughey route with chic flicks. Instead, he became an actor of quality in some substantial films.This isn't the most exciting film you'll ever see, but it is absorbing.",7,2,3,29 April 2010
The Terminal," Nice Spielberg-Hanks collaboration
","Tom Hanks is Viktor Navorski, a man without a country who lives in 'The Terminal,' a 2004 film directed by Steven Spielberg. While Viktor is en route to the U.S. to fulfill a wish of his late father's, there is a coup in the Eastern European country he calls home. When he lands at JFK airport, he finds he cannot enter the U.S. because his country is no longer recognized by the U.S., and all flights home have been canceled. While waiting in this limbo, Viktor takes up residence in the Terminal, to the chagrin of one of the administrators (Stanley Tucci) for whom Viktor is becoming somewhat of an embarrassment.This is a delightful film, if a bit too long, about the true meaning of home, about resourcefulness, and how a dream can propel a person to keep going no matter the odds. There are some funny scenes such as one of the custodial people, Gupta, watching people slide across his wet floors, Viktor taking apart seats at Gate 67 to make a bed, walking across the terminal in his bathrobe, and gathering luggage wagons so he can turn them in for quarters (he lost the food vouchers he was given). A brilliant contractor in his own country, Viktor even finds work in the terminal when his talent is recognized by the boss of one of the crews doing repairs on the building.Viktor makes many friends at the Terminal and even falls in love with a flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is attached to a married man and can't seem to break it off. That and the peanut can that Viktor carries around with him make up the poignant parts of the story.The performances are wonderful. Hanks is a true Everyman as Viktor and really gives one the feel for what it's like to be alone in a strange place and not know much of the language. In one sad moment, he watches the TV monitors and cries as he realizes his country is in trouble. Viktor is a smart man as well as being a grounded and basic one. As with all his other roles, Hanks sails through the part, making it look both believable and easy. Zeta-Jones is a stunning and vivacious Amelia who sees Viktor's true worth even as she is pulled in another direction by a dead end relationship. Stanley Tucci, an airport administrator to whom Viktor has become an embarrassment, does an excellent job portraying a rules-only mindset and the disconnect between his job and the people he's supposed to serve. In one of the most powerful scenes, he refuses to let a man into the country with medicine for his dying father because the correct forms weren't filled out in the man's country of origin. All of the supporting characters who learn the meaning of true friendship from Viktor - Cruz, Gupta, et al. are fantastic.'The Terminal' is a real feel-good movie, beautifully directed and acted, touching and engrossing. Highly recommended for the smile it will leave on your face.",9,1,4,12 July 2007
Music and Lyrics," Very enjoyable
","Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are the 'Music and Lyrics' in this 2007 film, also starring Brad Garrett, Kirsten Johnson, and Haley Bennett. Hugh Grant plays Alex Fletcher, a former teen idol who was part of a group called Pop in the '80s. His partner went off on his own and became a big star, but Alex is stuck doing concerts at Great Adventure and Knox Berry Farm. When he gets the chance to write a song for a hot property, a Britney type named Cora, his agent (Garrett) frantically sends him a lyricist, who doesn't work out. But Sophie Fisher (Barrymore) who is replacing his plant waterer, turns out to be a natural lyricist. He finally convinces her to work with him, though it isn't easy.There's no real substance to this movie, nor was any substance intended. It's a light, fun, highly entertaining movie with charming stars. The flashbacks to the Pop music videos and Grant doing his famous 'Pop' move are great. Grant has a great turn with a line, and Barrymore is very sweet.A good time. Don't look for War and Peace, and you'll enjoy it.",8,0,0,13 July 2009
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," I believe I can fly
","From 2015, Birdman is a satire on show business directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, who was also a co-writer of the script.The story concerns Riggan Thomson, a movie star best known for the role of the superhero Birdman and its sequels.Now in a midlife crisis, Riggan has left Hollywood and is preparing to perform on the Broadway stage. The play he is starring in and directing is one that he is also coproducing with his friend Jake (Zach Galifianakis). It is Riggan's adaptation of a Raymond Carver story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. Riggan and Jake have put all their money into the show. As the previews begin, there are problems. Riggan hates the actor in the supporting role. One of the women in the show brings in her boyfriend, a well-known actor, Mike Shiner. He is difficult to work with and also improvisational. At this first preview, he trashes the entire stage when he realizes the gin he is supposed to be drinking is water.Riggan has hired his daughter Sam as his assistant; he wants to be there for her since she has just gotten out of rehab.Finally the New York Times critic, Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) tells Riggan she's going to destroy his play and him and close it down opening night. Riggan is tortured by Birdman's voice, feeding his insecurities. Birdman looks like one long take, and it is accompanied by a beautiful score.Michael Keaton is tremendous as Riggan. Someone said it was his last chance for an Oscar. When he's 100, that may be true. He did a fabulous job. Unfortunately one way to win an Oscar is to have some sort of implant in your mouth (see the book Flesh & Fantasy) so he lost to someone who had an implant in his mouth.Ed Norton, for me anyway, almost outshone him, but Keaton's role was more layered and his performance matched it. Norton actually was doing a parody of himself and his bad reputation. He was perfect.As Riggan's daughter, Emma Stone hands in another wonderful performance and the difficulty in their father-daughter relationship was well played.Naomi Watts often ends up in these frantic roles at which she excels. Here as a young actress who's not sure what she wants but thought she did, she does a beautiful job, as does Andrea Risborough as Laura, an actress who tells Riggan that she's pregnant (by him). All of the acting is top notch.I have a few things to point out. Whenever someone is in a profession and sees a film concerning that profession, that person is going to have plenty to say. I am no longer a New York actress but here goes.The St. James theater is extremely prestigious; however, in its 80- year history, it's been used maybe twice for plays. The only one I can think of is Becket. And the reason for using that huge theater? It starred Laurence Olivier and Anthony Quinn and could sell out 1500 seats.No actor would be caught dead in the dressing room inhabited by Keaton, which looked like a utility room. Actors usually paint, decorate, and furnish their rooms, even if the show winds up running one week. Whether Riggan would do it or not, the St. James doesn't have anything that looks like that serving as a dressing room. Could you see Olivier sitting in that thing? This film was supposedly using the St. James, but a very seedy part of the building.This movie is a real knock at show biz. Actors trying to stay relevant, everyone and his brother being in a superhero movie (which used to be B movies), actors' insecurities.Riggan's greatest fame occurs when he tries to kill himself and before that, being locked out of the theater in his underwear. This does him a lot of good on Twitter and makes him relevant.He realizes finally that nowadays, success is success wherever you go. It's not based on achievement, it's based on people talking about you, on the 'buzz.' I remember Jessica Lange saying she went into theater because she hated the politics of films. When she got to the theater, she realized it was exactly the same. And if someone could star a Real Housewife or a Kardashian in a play, they would. They may still.The final scene is Riggan's grasp on reality and understanding that he doesn't have to try to achieve anything. His daughter smiles because he's finally figured it out.Not everyone liked or could even tolerate this movie; I suspect theater people might be more sympathetic to it. What we talk about when we talk about love -- it's for each of us to figure out for ourselves.",7,0,2,21 February 2016
The Big Short," Interesting, fun, and depressing
","'The Big Short' from 2015 is another look at the big crash of 2006- 2007 which wrecked the housing market, the bank, brokerage firms, and lots and lots of people.There were, in this true story, a few investors who realized that the mortgage-backed securities business was a big fraud with nothing underneath it, and they bet against it. But they didn't understand how deep the corruption of the banks went and just how bad the crash was going to be for everyone.The film stars Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Melissa Leo, Marisa Tomei, and Brad Pitt with some interesting guests, including Chef Bourdain and Selena Gomez, brought in to explain aspects of the mortgage-backed securities. I've seen so many different films and documentaries about the crash, but this makes the story really understandable.The director, Adam McKay, has an excellent handle on what could have been a confusing, muddled film. He not only gives us some excellent characters but a clear understanding of the situation, rendering it comical. Like Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room documentary, the things the SEC, brokers, etc., are willing to overlook or simply not check because of greed is outrageous. One thing that bugged me - the character Christian Bale plays, Dr. Michael Burry, one of the people that realized the fraud, has a 'glass eye.' Why must people continue to use that term? Does anyone realize how heavy a glass eye is? Artificial eyes have been made of a light acrylic for decades, yet this term is constantly used.I am not sure how they did it, but the same thing was done in 'Valkyrie' -- somehow at certain angles, the artificiality is indicated with a slightly droopy upper lid or a lack of energy - remarkable. Also, the way it would occasionally bother Bale was subtle but accurate.Standouts in the film, besides Bale, are Pitt as an ex-broker who helps a new firm, Steve Carell as an outspoken broker, and Melissa Leo in a small but effective role as someone working for the SEC, and Hamish Linklater as Porter Collins, one of the men interviewing brokers and clients, trying to get some answers.This is such a disturbing story, all the more horrible because of its ramifications and the fact that absolutely nothing was done about it. The banks were bailed out and paid big bonuses with the money. No one went to prison, any reform was stopped -- because the corporations are the ones who call the shots. The big question asked here by several brokers of the banks is, how are you screwing us? Good question. And they're still doing it.",8,1,1,26 March 2016
Wonder Woman," Girl power all the way
","Wonder Woman is pure summer escapist entertainment. These blockbusters were designed to get people into the theaters and to appeal to 15-year-old boys in Taiwan - normally not my thing, but they definitely have their place.Here Diana is Gal Gadot who has it all and boy does she kick some you-know-what. The actress apparently did her own stunts, including while she was five months pregnant. So she's a superwoman in real life and in reel life, also having served with the Israeli Army.The cast includes Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, and Danny Huston. How fabulous to see the 'House of Cards' leading lady, Wright, as an Amazon warrior.In this version, Diana fights in World War I, not II, which director Patty Jenkins found more interesting.Filmed partially in Italy, the settings are glorious. Superheroes, all-powerful men and women who fight evil in the world, started to become popular during World War II, I wonder why, feeding into the fantasy of someone swooping down and solving our problems. If only! But there's nothing wrong with being entertained, looking at a couple of beautiful people in Pine and Gadot, and hearing that only love can save the world. It's a good reminder and bears repeating.",10,17,34,6 July 2017
The Queen," A Queen of Drama plays the Queen of England
","Helen Mirren is 'The Queen,' a 2006 film that dramatizes what went on in the Royal House of Windsor after the death of Princess Diana, when Queen Elizabeth is deeply criticized for refusing to speak publicly about the event. Prime Minister Tony Blair urges her to change her mind. Elizabeth must grapple with her own views in a changing world that has somehow left her behind.The acting in this film is so excellent that I forgot I was watching actors and actually believed I was watching the real situation. This left me wondering how close to the truth it was. The emotions conveyed were probably correct even if actual incidents were not. 'The Queen' is a brilliant psychological study of a woman who, when she was young, had fame thrust upon her, as she deals with the death of her ex-daughter-in-law, who achieved greatness. Michael Sheen was absolutely uncanny as Tony Blair, who walks a fine line dealing with Buckingham Palace and political forces; and James Cromwell as Phillip comes off as a bitter, angry Diana hater...probably not far from the truth.To understand Queen Elizabeth and her actions, the family's history is important. Her branch of the family was not intended for the throne; it was the unusual circumstance of Edward, Duke of Windsor, abdicating that made the Elizabeth's father, the shy George, King of England. In a world where responsibility came first and personal feelings second, it was a shocking situation. Some years later, Elizabeth, who worshipped her father, was seen off on a trip to Africa by King George. White-faced and ill, he watched her plane until it disappeared in the sky. Prince Philip was taken aside during the African trip and told that the King was dead; long live the Queen. A shattered Elizabeth had to emerge from the plane on her return to England as a young woman in complete control of her emotions - a young woman who should have been King Edward's niece, a royal personage who occasionally cut a ribbon - was herself the Queen.Her life became one of formality, respectability and responsibility while her sister Margaret dated divorced men, drank, and took trips to islands with male companions. It isn't any wonder that Diana was someone she could never understand - or understood better than she wanted. The most poignant scene in the film occurs when Elizabeth sees a noble stag that all the hunters are after and shoos it away. A metaphor certainly for Diana, a beautiful creature who had wandered into a world she could never comfortably live in nor understand.Helen Mirren has long been one of my favorite actresses; her performance is perfection. She portrays Elizabeth as strong, intelligent and reserved, but with a kind heart and sensitivity. It's one of those rare times when the actress becomes the role rather than plays it.The script is superb, and the use of news footage of Princess Diana is edited into the film beautifully. Although all of the acting is wonderful, Helen Mirren towers over this movie, giving a powerful, unforgettable performance of a remarkable woman.",9,3,5,11 November 2007
Blow," A cocaine dealer's true story
","Johnny Depp gives a fantastic performance as George Jung, a real-life drug dealer whose story is embodied in the 2001 film 'Blow.' Depp also narrates as the viewer is brought through how drugs brought George a life most people only dream of living while it took away the only things that matter.The story spans 30 years and focuses on George's relationship with his parents (Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths), his early marijuana supplier (Paul Reubens), and first crowd of friends and spans his various imprisonments, a shift from marijuana to cocaine, involvements with cartels in South America, his marriage and the birth of his daughter.Ted Demme, with the help of Depp's multilayered performance, weaves a very engrossing story here. I agree with one of the comments here - the last thing I would have expected was for a film like this to bring me to tears, but Depp's final scene does. A sad morality tale, excellently told. Highly recommended.",8,0,1,12 October 2008
Raging Bull," Scorcese robbed
","Well, I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in my entire life, but there it is.I realize that this film lost to 'Ordinary People,' a film I love. I am not an idiot - I know that Martin Scorcese is a great, very gifted artist who puts powerful images on the screen. I agree that he has been cheated out of the Academy Award many times, which makes one realize they don't count for much. For DeNiro, this stands as one of the greatest performances of all time. DeNiro is one of a handful of American actors who has earned his place at the top - he's there with Brando, Pacino, and Newman. 'Raging Bull' helped put him there. As far as the rest of the acting, Cathy Moriarity epitomizes the '40s blond and a Bronx woman, and Joe Pesci is perfect as LaMotta's brother.Scorcese presents here the turbulent life of Jake Lamotta with all its brutality, sparing us nothing in his fights, his anger against his wives, his brother, no one. His obsessive nature, his jealousy, his - well, hey, his rage - does not make him a likable character. LaMotta himself was disturbed by how he came off on screen, but then had the honesty to admit that he was a bastard.Scorcese creates the Bronx and the bloody horror of the fight ring in a way no one else ever has. The first shot of the lone boxer in the ring is stunning, as is the real LaMotta's own practicing of a speech in a dressing room. Everything about this film evinces the aura of a special era, especially the color home movies - a brilliant touch.The only problem I had with the film was that it was boring and unwatchable. I finally got so sick of all the screaming and yelling and watching this unlikeable, obnoxious character that I turned the set off. I thought if he tortured his wife one more time asking her if she slept with his brother, I was going to put my fist through the set.This is the age-old question - you know something is great art but it doesn't speak to you. You like something that's very well done but a little less artistic better - does this means you are one of the masses for whom mediocrity has become your idea of what's good? I don't know. I like to think I can appreciate a beautifully made film. But I think what I can appreciate more than that are complicated characters I understand on some level - or want to understand, real emotions, real heartache - probably more than magnificent film-making. When there is both, it's magic. For me, 'Raging Bull' was not one of those times. 'Godfather I,' 'Godfather II,' yes. I really hate writing these comments.",5,44,70,25 June 2006
Taken 2," everyone seemed to hate it
","For a movie people seem to hate, Taken 2 managed somehow to gross $376 million at the box office worldwide, with a $45 million budget, which is more money than Taken made. Often when a film is bad, the first audiences will say, 'don't waste your time,' but that didn't seem to happen.The original cast is back: Liam Neeson, Famke Janssen, Maggie Grace, and Leland Orser. We left Taken with Bryan (Neeson) and his ex-wife (Lenore) becoming friends again. Now Lenore and her husband have separated and he's canceled a huge family trip. Bryan invites her and Kim to come with him to Istanbul. Talk about a mistake.Murad (Rade Sherbedgia), the father of one of the kidnappers killed by Bryan, wants revenge and sets out to kidnap the entire family. His team of merry men manage to get Bryan and Lenore, but Maggie, warned by her father, escapes. Once he's kidnapped and he and Lenore are left alone, he manages to get some part of his phone and give her instructions. After what she went through in Taken, I don't know how she kept so together. I would have been a zombie.Anyway, there's an enormous car chase that I thought was pretty neat and suspenseful.I certainly agree this is no 'Taken,' and the script was slapped together when the first film made so much money. It's pretty flimsy. It's not terrible.",7,0,2,6 November 2013
The Woman in Black," the play is better
","Amazing to see Daniel Radcliffe mature into adulthood, and there's something about him that makes him very right for these period pieces. He stars with Ciaran Hinds, Roger Allam, and Janet McTeer in 'The Woman in Black,' a 2012 film based on the novel.Having just returned from London and seen the play, this was a very different experience and not as good. I think the main reason is that you must see this film with an audience. That is how it's meant to be seen.The story concerns a young attorney who is sent to the remote home of a recently deceased woman to go through her papers and experiences strange and frightening happenings and runs into resistance from the community for even being there.The atmosphere is very spooky and dark, and the director, James Watkins, keeps the tension going throughout.The play is the second-longest running nonmusical in London, after The Mousetrap. It's a two-person production and scary as all get-out, with the audience screaming bloody murder in several spots.The story is basically the same except for the ending and the set-up. In the play, Arthur Kipps, as an old man, has hired an actor to help him dramatize the story, one he feels must be told. The actor plays the younger Kipps, and the older Kipps plays all of the other parts.A good story with strong acting and lots of scares - and really one to see at least with a group of people if not a full audience.",7,0,0,16 September 2015
Vanilla Sky," Interesting but ultimately disappointing
","This film is worth seeing on several levels but ultimately it disappoints. The lead role was a perfect fit for Tom Cruise - normally, I find him external and not really believable; however, in this part, I liked his acting.  His scene before a panel of doctors is especially effective. I always love Cameron Diaz.  As for Penelope Cruz, I will only ask, what is the big deal.I thought I was going to be watching a compelling murder mystery.  Turns out that wasn't really the case. The way the true plot is introduced, very late into the film (like the end), I felt like it was the kitchen sink being thrown in.  That is one objection I have.  The other objection I have is, though the film only ran about two hours, it moved very slowly and seemed MUCH longer.  Whenever that's the case, you know there's a problem.  Fifteen minutes at the beginning could easily have been cut and we would have gotten the point of the main character's life and lifestyle, and the pivotal scene of the film would have been moved back considerably.Nevertheless, if you're up for seeing something that will spark discussion, intrigue you and has depth to it, this is a good one to see. It doesn't succeed but hey, Cameron Crowe tried.",5,4,7,28 January 2002
Fifty Shades of Grey," Yeah, I'm sorry, it is that bad
","'Fifty Shades of Grey' is based on a badly written book, so why someone thought they could make a decent film out of it is beyond me. Actually I don't think anyone believed they could make a good film, the producers just wanted the money that would come in from all people who for reasons known only to themselves read the book.I had a free ticket and I had to go in order to do a story on it. Bottom line, I'm not doing a story on it.Okay, here's the problem, and this is what breaks my heart. We no longer know what good or great is. I am no follower of Ayn Rand, but in The Fountainhead, she predicted the rise of mediocrity, mediocrity being considered great and the norm we shoot for. It only stands to reason that at this point, some things can't even rise to that sad level. This isn't mediocre, it's pathetic. I can't believe there are people complimenting the actors. But then I can, because they have come to accept mediocrity. Something I fight against with all my heart.There is one other problem. The book sucked; in order to like it, one had to use his or her imagination. The success of this book lay in the fantasy aspect. Sometimes imagination is more powerful than just about anything and can give you an erotic experience. This film doesn't fulfill the most inane imagination, let alone someone who really has a wild and creative one. The only fantasy it can give you is how fast you can get out of the theater.There were people around me laughing. The ones who weren't left, and from what I found out in the lobby, actually demanded and got their money back. When was the last time you saw people leaving a movie in the middle? I'm not sure I've ever seen it, and I'll guess I've been going to movies longer than a lot of you.I lament the loss of artistic soul, of creativity, of going for the best. I miss the days when Billy Wilder was a writer and a filmmaker. What are we left with but a horrible book written on a first grade level and the resulting bad movie.",1,728,943,12 February 2015
Any Given Sunday," Macho and totally American
","I rented this film because of the cast.  I have no interest in football. This is a totally macho movie about a tired coach who, while attempting to bring his pain killer-addicted, crippled team to victory, comes up against a young Turk and the equally young, nervous heiress owner.  I found myself drawn in by the marvelous performances of Pacino, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz, (a young woman determined not to become yesterday's gorgeous ingenue and succeeding), Ann-Margret, James Woods, Jim Brown and others. It's a story about the old and young accepting one another, about teamwork and about aging, all noble themes. It's also about becoming a paralyzed invalid for money and putting aside any integrity you might have in order to win. On that level, this is a quintessential American film that could only have been made, of course, by a Canadian!  All in all, very engrossing and exciting and definitely worth seeing, even if you couldn't care less about football.",7,0,0,15 October 2000
The Greatest Showman," Magnetic Hugh
","Hugh Jackman is one of the most charismatic performers in existence, and he proves it again as P.T. Barnum in 'The Greatest Showman.' The film also stars Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Zendaya, and Rebecca Ferguson.The film is a 98 percent fictionalized story of the rise of P.T. Barnum. Barnum was a fascinating and somewhat controversial character. He was part of the government of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and made many improvements there. The film touches on few of his accomplishments, concentrating on his circus.I've heard the music described as having 'High School Musical' type tunes. Were they awful? No. Pleasant and well-sung? Definitely. The film is a huge spectacle and intended to be seen on the big screen. The choreography is wonderful, too.My only gripe in this otherwise enjoyable film is that Jenny Lind sang pop songs. I realize that was done because it would have been too jarring with the other music in the film, but at the very least, she should have sung something in a soprano voice, even if it was Carry Me Back to Old Virginny. I've seen Hugh Jackman on stage three times - he's always sensational. Zac Efron sang and danced well and exhibits a new maturity.Anyone interested should read about the fascinating and varied accomplishments of P.T. Barnum. This is no biopic. But it is fun.",8,6,12,6 October 2018
Ben-Hur," What a spectacle!
","Possibly the most sweeping epic ever to hit the screen, the 1959 'Ben-Hur' came by its 11 Oscars and 12 nominations honestly. It's truly a magnificent film, beautifully acted and directed by William Wyler.While working on the film, Wyler informed Charlton Heston that his performance wasn't good enough. When Heston asked what he could do, Wyler said, 'I don't know, but you have to do better.' He did. A controversial figure in real life, Heston nonetheless handed in some excellent performances in his reel life. This is his best, and he's matched by Stephen Boyd, an Irish actor who died too young. Other actors in the film include Sam Jaffe, Jack Hawkins, Hugh Griffith, Martha Scott, and Cathy O'Donnell.I'm not going to re-tell the story, just say that the spectacle of Ben-Hur is overwhelming, particularly the chariot race and the battle at sea. I consider myself a spiritual person, so needless to say, I found the story extremely moving, particularly the last hour.Exquisitely scored by Miklos Rosza, magnificently photographed and acted, perfectly directed by Wyler, with the chariot sequences directed by Yakima Canutt, and a sweeping story, 'Ben-Hur' is not to be missed, especially around Easter, when its story of forgiveness and redemption is a perfect fit for the holiday.",10,0,4,12 April 2009
Casino Royale," Big and beautiful
","Everything about the latest James Bond flick, 'Casino Royale,' is big and first-rate. Humongous action sequences, glorious scenery, a tense plot, a to-die-for Bond, incredibly beautiful women, and villains beyond evil. Daniel Craig is Bond, and when you get a look at his body, watch out. Not to mention those turquoise eyes. He's a tough Bond with less of a sense of humor and less relaxed than some previous 007s, but he fits the 21st century very well.This 'Casino Royale' is far superior to the 1967 episodic film which had huge problems including actors who refused to be in the same room with one another during scenes, different writers writing dialogue for the same scene that didn't match, things like that. This version is an actual story, with Bond going after a financier of terrorists, Le Chiffre, in order to take all the money in a poker game. Things don't work out as planned; Bond is nearly killed right at the poker table, among other situations. And the terrorists want the money being gambled away - enough to kill and torture for it.'That's quite a body count you've been stacking up,' M (Judi Dench) tells Bond. Indeed, he's taking people out right and left and acting like a renegade.Bond, with his loose sexuality and attitude toward women isn't exactly a modern hero. Here, with the excellent performance of Daniel Craig, he comes closer than he has in a while to being a Bond for this century.",8,2,6,24 September 2007
La Vie En Rose," spectacular portrayal of spectacular artist
","From 2007, La Vie en Rose is the story of the great Edith Piaf, a little woman with a huge voice, a huge soul, and huge eyes, who transcended her beginnings and became an international star.Marion Cotillard is Piaf, and what a magnificent job she does - ethereally beautiful in sections, she creates an unforgettable portrait of a woman who loved and sang and lived with great passion but in the end was her own worst enemy due to drugs and alcohol. Like so many people, she became addicted to painkillers after an accident, and both her parents are depicted as alcoholics. I can only describe the end of the film as shattering and heartbreaking due to Cotillard's fantastic acting.That's the performance - now to the movie. A life like Piaf's isn't easy to get into a couple of hours, even a couple of hours plus like this one, so events in her life are skipped or go by very quickly. Director Olivier Dahan moves from the end of Piaf's life to the beginning and the middle throughout, and in my opinion, he does it expertly. What's not so expert is the hurried way some of the incidents are presented, for instance, the murder of Leplee (Gérard Depardieu) - you would have to know Piaf's life to follow what happened in those scenes.Also, the reappearance of certain characters after many years had passed - one look at the message board tells you that many viewers didn't know who they were. I'm a complete snob and I admit it, so why people thought the older blond woman who approaches Piaf and raves about her work was Marilyn Monroe is beyond me. Okay, it wasn't the best Marlene Dietrich I've ever seen, but she had her hair like Dietrich's, she was obviously a mature woman, everyone is so reverential -- if you think people were reverential toward Marilyn Monroe like that in those days, think again.All in all, I found the film excellent, despite incidents and relationships (Yves Montand, and the fact that her best friend Momone was actually a half-sister) being omitted. I need to also add that Pauline Burlet, who was the 10-year-old Edith, was absolutely beautiful in the role.Highly recommended for the story and for Piaf's incredible voice, heard in most of the songs. Cotillard performs 'Frou Frou' and Jil Aigrot does two numbers, the truncated 'Padam' and 'L'Accordéoniste.'",8,0,0,20 May 2013
Signs," not your typical sci-fi thriller
","If you went to this movie expecting a typical sci-fi thriller, you doubtless left disappointed.  If you went to this movie to see an M. Shamalayan Night film, you probably loved it, as I did.For me, the sci-fi aspects were a device to explore the lost faith of the Mel Gibson character, a man who had abandoned the ministry after a tragedy struck his family.  The film asks the questions, are we alone in the world (and he's not talking about aliens) and is there such a thing as a coincidence?  In one particularly striking scene, as he talks with his brother, Gibson's bitterness comes through.I happen to think there's a place for spirituality in film and I love Night's take on it.  I also like his old-fashioned type of film-making, the way he pays hommage to the greats and the way he surprises us.  Night believes we don't listen enough, and if we do, there are messages abounding for us.  I'd rather see this than a pretentious, dark, depressing film that pretends to say something.",8,24,47,12 November 2002
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," taking a chance on love
","Two young women spend the summer in Barcelona in 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona). At first, the women seem like caricatures: Vicky (Penelope Hall) is serious, somewhat conservative, and not much of a risk-taker; Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) is a free spirit, artistic, spontaneous, and up for adventure. However, one might look at them as two sides of the same woman.When an artist, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) invites them to Oviedo on a private plane, Cristina jumps at the chance, while a nervous Vicky goes along just to keep Cristina company. Cristina jumps into an affair with Juan Antonio; for Vicky, it's a one-nighter that destroys her concept of who she is and what she wants. While Cristina and Juan Antonio are together, Juan's ex-wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) shows up.Allen makes it clear that in his world (and in ours), many people opt for unhappiness rather than move out of an uncomfortable situation - which in its way, has become comfortable. At least it's the devil you know. While Cristina is seeking ways to express herself through art, and relishes all of her experiences as a means of finding herself, Vicky sees it all as a threat to what she believes she wants.The gorgeous Penelope Cruz is outstanding as the passionate, angry Maria Elena, and Javier Bardem portrays Juan Antonio as one who accepts a Bohemian lifestyle as a matter of course. Juan's and Maria's fights are delicious and very realistic. Scarlett Johansson is very right for the part of the young, natural beauty Cristina, for whom life is always a surprise as she tries to find her way.Beautifully photographed, this is a deceptive film. It's breezy, it's laid back, it's sexy -- like Cristina -- but again like Cristina, the film has many layers. Really good work by Allen - except for that disconcerting narration which added nothing to the film. Otherwise, it's solid.",7,1,2,19 July 2011
Identity," 10 Little Indians Meet at the Bates Motel
","I rented this on Netflix, and I didn't realize it was a 'Thriller' (horror movie!). I am NOT a horror film fan. I decided to give this film ten minutes and if it grossed me out, I was turning it off.I was not prepared for this stylish, well-written, well-acted film that was low on blood and high on suspense and mystery, beautifully directed by James Mangold. The stars are first rate - Ray Liotta, John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Rebecca de Mornay, Clea DuVall, John Hawkes, John C. McGinley, and Alfred Molina.The story concerns ten people stranded at a run-down Nevada hotel in the middle of what can only be described as a monsoon. They start dying one by one, and near each body is found a room key, starting with number 10. And I have to leave it there so I won't spoil it.I figured some of this plot out early on, thanks to years of watching mysteries and suspense films, but that didn't take away from the film's intensity or other various twists that occur. Even if you've been watching films as long as I have, you won't be prepared for some of what happens.Really excellent.",8,3,4,3 January 2012
Saving Mr. Banks," Bring tissues because Emma Thompson & Tom Hanks are just too good
","Tom Hanks is Walt Disney and Emma Thompson is P.L. Travers, the author of the 'Mary Poppins' series in 'Saving Mr. Banks,' a 2013 release.For twenty years, P.L. Travers has refused to sell the rights to her book Mary Poppins to Walt Disney. Finally, her agent tells her that she doesn't have any new sales or residuals coming in and she really ought to take Walt up on his offer. He has promised her final say on the film.Reluctantly, the uptight, very proper P.L. Travers goes to Hollywood and proceeds to make Walt Disney, composers Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak (Richard and Robert Sherman) and everyone else insane with her demands and criticisms. Despite his best efforts, Disney cannot get her to warm up to him, and after a period of time, she still hasn't signed over the rights.In a way, Disney understands because 'the mouse' (that would be Mickey) is very personal for him, and when he had the chance, he wouldn't sell the character. But in another way, he is mystified. Travers herself doesn't understand what drives her stubbornness, yet she keeps having flashbacks to her own childhood in Australia with her sweet albeit drunken father (Colin Farrell), her unhappy mother (Ruth Wilson), and the woman who came to make everything all right (Rachel Griffiths).The film should really be called 'Solving P.L. Travers' because it's the story of a woman coming to terms with her life and being able to let go of the past. Emma Thompson is absolutely wonderful as an unlikeable woman who becomes more likable as we gradually understand her, and Hanks is fantastic as Disney, a remarkable man with great vision, and also one who is used to winning people over...at the moment, his charm and forceful personality aren't working.Paul Giametti makes the most out of his role as chauffeur to Travers; Kathy Baker, an excellent actress, is delightful as Walt's secretary; and Rachel Griffiths, as a Mary Poppins prototype, has a tiny part. Melanie Paxson is delightful as another Disney employee, as is Bradley Whitford.A very moving film, with plenty going on underneath the light story of making Mary Poppins. Watch it until the final credits are finished - you won't be sorry.",9,3,6,20 December 2013
Live Free or Die Hard," hold on tight
","'Live Free and Die Hard' is the 2007 entry into the Die Hard series, starring Bruce Willis as John McClane and Justin Long.Here, it's basically a disgruntled employee wreaking total havoc on the U.S. and shutting down everything - power, communication, you name it. And the professional hackers the group hired to write the programs are murdered one by one so they can't talk. All except one (Justin Long), and he's been picked up by John McClane.That's the basic plot. This is a summer blockbuster movie meant to be experienced in a theater. It is nonstop. There are more explosions, car chases, crashes, leap from tall building, individuals attached to speeding cars on the outside, cars suspended in mid-air with someone hanging off the end, and characters who have been through being shot, karate chopped, jujitsued, thrown against walls, and strangled who still manage to live per second than perhaps any other film.I can only say if you like this kind of film, this is one in the genre to see.The script must have contained maybe two pages of dialogue total.If you like your films fast and action-packed, this is for you.",7,1,1,8 December 2012

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," looks like a lot of people really hated it
","Somehow, even with all the hatred, Star Wars: The Force Awakens managed to bring in 2 billion. Obviously the box office is no indication of whether or not a movie is good. The appeal was the reuniting of the original cast - Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Luke Hamill, along with Chewie and 3CPO, and to introduce some new characters to carry on in the next films.I have to admit, it looked like a big video game to me. What I enjoyed the most was Ford, particularly his repartee with Chewy. For me, it was great to see Fisher and Hamill again.These films that take place in space are yesterday's westerns and war movies. It used to be the science fiction films, the Buck Rogers, Superman, Dick Tracy etc., were B movies. Once the computer and CGI came in, they quickly became A films, perfect for the big screen. Someone once told me that most movies are made for 15-year-old boys in Thailand. It makes sense - I mean, what was there to grasp about this film that a 15-year-old non-English speaking person couldn't grasp? I haven't followed this franchise much since the first three films, though I did see the Anakin Skywalker-Natalie Portman movie. I think it's fairly obvious that this film brings us back to the original Star Wars. Harrison Ford was paid $10,000 for the first Star Wars. His salary is higher now and he has a percentage of the box office. He's old, he looks old, but you can't beat him. He's an old-fashioned movie star in an old-fashioned movie. I didn't feel that Carrie Fisher had enough to do though I enjoyed her.So why give this an 8? Why? It was fun, it was entertaining, I loved the original stars. The new people -- Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac are all attractive and are very good. Will I go and see the next Star Wars? Probably, because Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are in it and somehow, so is Harrison Ford. That to me is Star Wars.",8,4,33,14 May 2016
RED," Retired-Extreme-Dangerous - and fabulous!
","Talk about a great time - 2010's Red is a fun and exciting experience.The film stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Mary Louise Parker, Richard Dreyfuss, and Ernest Borgnine. Willis is an ex-black ops CIA agent, Frank, who enjoys talking on the phone with the young woman, Sarah (Mary Louise Parker) responsible for sending his pension checks. However, when he realizes that someone is trying to kill him, he also knows his phone has been bugged and she's in danger. So he kidnaps Sarah and takes her along while he reassembles members of his old team: Joe (Freeman) who is living in a nursing home, Marvin (Malkovich), who is living a bizarre, paranoid existence, and Victoria (Mirren), who seems to be some sort of socialite, and they try to find out why, after all this time of being retired, someone is after Frank, and who is it? Fast-paced, with great performances, Red is funny and fun, with nonstop action. Malkovich is a total scream in the wildest role, as is Mirren, an elegant British lady who is aces with a shotgun. Mary-Louise Parker is great as a woman who reads spy novels and now has a chance to live one, and her chemistry with Willis is wonderful.A total treat.

Flight," alcoholism close up
","Denzel Washington stars in Flight, a 2012 film directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film also stars Bruce Greenwood, John Goodman, Kelly Reilly, and Tamara Tunie.Washington plays Whip Whitaker, a veteran pilot who is a cocaine-snorting alcoholic. During a flight, the plane he's piloting malfunctions and starts careening toward earth. Somehow Whip is able to land it, with six lives being lost, when in the hands of another pilot (as they prove in flight simulation), all passengers and crew would have been lost.While Whip is in the hospital recovering, his blood is drawn, and the toxicology report shows that he has cocaine in his system and three times the legal alcohol limit -- if you're driving a car.The airline lawyer and others believe that the manufacturer of the plane is at fault, but Whip's blood test complicates matters. Whip meanwhile denies he's an alcoholic, though he tries to stop drinking several times and fails. He has a chance to save himself from any malfeasance in the accident -- but will he take it? A good film with an excellent performance by Washington as a man who can't face up to the fact that he is a drunk, that he lost his wife and child because he is a drunk, and that his job is now in danger because he is a drunk. He meets a young woman, Nicole (Kelly Reilly) in the hospital who is trying to get clean from heroin, and her attempts to get him help fail as well.This film isn't without problems, and in a way, it's a good thing the star is Washington because he saves it. First of all, the addition of the Nicole character is hackneyed, and one could see how it was going to play out right away.Another problem I have is -- and this may not be a problem, but I don't know much about pilots - the fact that he was sleeping up until the plane started its descent and the copilot woke him up. Could he have noticed a problem beforehand had he been awake? The fact that he was asleep is never mentioned.I have another problem but it's a spoiler, so I won't reference it here.The fact that Whip performed a miracle while intoxicated isn't unheard of, as there have been reports of surgeons performing perfect surgeries while in an alcoholic blackout, actors line-perfect on stage while in blackouts -- and Whip wasn't even in a blackout. The fact that Whip did perform a miracle makes the situation all the more tragic, that he had so much ability and was willing to throw it all away by flying while intoxicated.Definitely worth seeing for Denzel's performance and for the accurate depiction of the denial and power of addiction.",8,1,5,28 February 2013
Munich," The human side of warring factions
","First, on a light note, I saw 'Road to Perdition' right before I saw this film, and therefore made the conclusion that Daniel Craig is in every film made. At this point, I feel like I know his face better than one of my family members.'Munich' is a powerful story done by a powerhouse group, as it is directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Tony Kushner. It's the story of a young Israeli, Avner (Eric Bana), who is asked to head up a team with the mission to eliminate the men responsible for the massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympics. The situation is re-enacted but real television news clips are used throughout the beginning of the film. Though he has a wife and their first child is on the way, Avner accepts the assignment, which takes him all over the world tracking down and killing the miscreants. When his assignment comes to an end, he finds he is unable to shake his experiences.'Munich' demonstrates, in the form of Avner and his team, the disintegration of those qualities that make us human beings in the first place. These men believe in what they're doing but become disillusioned - can they all be trusted? Whom can they trust? What is the point of, as one of them puts it, 'all this blood' when the people they kill are replaced with worse people? In the beginning, Avner clearly has no affection for killing - he watches, horrified, as it goes on. The team is careful not to hurt civilians - for instance, they protect a little girl, the daughter of one of the Black September planners, from a bomb intended for her father. Later, Avner's orders are 'just do it,' and there are bodies of innocent victims everywhere. Avner pays a man named Louis huge money for information on the whereabouts of the Black September men - and then begins to doubt him - is he in turn telling the other side his whereabouts because he has become a target? I agree that Spielberg does not take sides in the film and shows how everyone suffers in any violent conflict, and that after a time, people hate for the sake of hating and kill for the sake of killing, often forgetting what started the whole cycle.Eric Bana gives a fantastic performance as Avner. He looks so different at the end of the film than at the beginning, as he becomes increasingly more paranoid. He is particularly frightening in the scene where he is making love to his wife and reliving what he's been through. One really feels the harrowing experiences he's had and what it has done to his spirit.A thought-provoking and sobering film.",9,6,10,22 May 2007
The Truman Show," Deceptive
","Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the star of 'The Truman Show' in this 1998 film directed by Peter Weir. Truman's life is a fake reality show, watched by millions of viewers, though he doesn't know that. He lives in the small seaside town of Seahaven, a peaceful place. Truman is married, has a best friend and works as an insurance agent. He has an unnatural fear of water after being in a boating accident in which his father died.One day he boards an elevator and it isn't an elevator; he sees his dead father in town; and a woman has a strange message for him that he doesn't understand. He tries to leave town with his wife, and it simply doesn't happen. The 'reality,' if there is one, is that Truman doesn't really exist; the town is fake, filled with actors (one of whom, the man who played his father, comes back to make trouble). That person on the bicycle, the passing car, etc., that's on a repeating loop. He has a public he has never met who follow each phase of life with interest. His producer, the man who created Truman, is a man named Christof, who took an illegitimate child and turned him into a media star. When Truman tries to get out, he realizes just how trapped he is.With today's reality shows abounding, 'The Truman Show' today is even more fascinating than it was in 1998. Here's a reality show that's not a reality - and it makes you wonder about what we're watching on reality shows today. It brings up all the metaphysical questions of who am I and who made me. The film also asks us to take a look at our attraction to the lives of celebrities, where people are merely an image, and where we separate the events of their lives from the actual human being for some good gossip; after all, we only know the persona, not the real person, and we only know what the media reports, not the whole story. In the end we have no idea of what Britney Spears or Madonna or Brangelina are like as people, what they think, what their day to day life is like. In the movie, we know Truman's - and his whole story is false.It's said that a great comedian can do drama, and Jim Carrey is proof of this, giving a brilliant, heartfelt performance as Truman. Ed Harris is fabulous as Christoff, the puppeteer who created Truman and needs him. Such a wonderful film, it demands a second viewing.",8,1,4,13 July 2008
Looper," unusual time travel movie
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars with Bruce Willis, Jeff Daniels, and Emily Blunt in 'Looper,' a 2012 film written and directed by Rian Johnson.Gordon-Levitt plays Joe in the year 2044. He is a 'looper.' In order to clean up the future, loopers are sent to the past where they kill known criminals. For this, they get paid in silver bars. At the end of their run, the looper kills his older self in the future, takes the silver and enjoys 30 years of retirement.All of this happens to Joe. He kills his older self and takes the gold bars (that's the final payoff) and has a good retirement. After some travel, he moves to China and meets a beautiful woman whom he adores, and they get married.After 30 years, he is picked up to be killed but escapes and goes back to the past, where Young Joe recognizes him. Old Joe and Young Joe talk - Old Joe has come back to the past to find a vicious criminal who, in the future, killed Old Joe's wife. He plans on finding this person and killing him before he can do damage in the future. That way his wife will still be with him.The great thing about 'Looper' is that although the story sounds convoluted, thanks to the direction and script, it's quite easy to follow. Though I'm not an expert on this type of film, I found it fresh and unusual, and also well worth seeing.Johnson, who has directed episodes of 'Breaking Bad' and some other films, is an effective director, and we'll definitely be seeing much more of him, both in his direction and his scripts. Interesting premise, well executed.",7,0,2,5 March 2013
Heat," Clash of the Titans
","Heat certainly sports an amazing cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Dennis Haylsbert, Amy Brenneman, Ted Levine, and Tom Sizemore. Top drawer all the way, and directed by Michael Mann, who knows something about action movies.Despite this, Heat managed, for this viewer, to be about forty minutes too long (the version I saw was nearly three hours) and slow.The story concerns two dedicated men: Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and Neil McCauley (De Niro). One is on the side of the law, and the other is a master criminal who has pulled off some amazing heists.Neil and his team target banks, vaults, and armored cars. When there's a problem on one of the jobs, the police finally has a clue and the robbers begin to feel the heat. Vincent has to begrudgingly admire McCauley for his cleverness. The two men are similar: both are dedicated to their work at the expense of their private lives. Vincent is married to Justine (Venora), who has a troubled daughter (Portman). The marriage is on the rocks; Neil doesn't want to share his work with Justine, and is away on the job all the time and noncommunicative at home.Neil has a philosophy, which is, 'Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out on in thirty seconds flat, if you spot the heat coming around the corner.' He disapproves of one of his associates, Shiherlis (Kilmer) because he is married with a child. His wife (Judd) is unhappy because Shiherlis is a compulsive gambler and doesn't act like an adult. But when Neil meets Eady (Brennemen), he falls in love. The men plan one last big score, though the heat is becoming more intense.I'm sure I will be criticized, but I didn't care for this film. At a length rivaling Gone with the Wind, the story could have been told in two hours. As it is, it's slow going. There are several gun fights, with bullets the size of rocks going through windshields, car bodies, and people on the streets of Los Angeles. After a while it became mind-numbing.In New York City and I assume most big cities, the police can draw their guns, identify yourselves as officers, and pursue the suspects; I guess in Los Angeles it doesn't matter how many pedestrians and cars are around.The acting is excellent -- it's hard to miss with a cast like this -- and it is exciting to see Pacino and DeNiro together. I just wish it had been in something else.There are many positive reviews on this site. I'm curious as to how many of the positive reviews came from men. This is a man's movie all the way, from the behavior of the various women to the automatic weapons and explosions.If the film had been shorter and tighter, I might have liked it better.",6,3,6,24 February 2014
Thirteen Days," In a word - WOW!
","In 1962, the world stood on the brink of World War III for 'Thirteen Days,' a 2000 film starring Kevin Costner, Bruce Greenwood, Steven Culp and Dylan Baker, with direction by Roger Donaldson. The story concerns the 'Cuban Missile Crisis,' when the U.S. discovered that the Soviets had placed missiles aimed at the U.S. in Cuba.As someone who remembers the situation well, watching this was a profound experience in more ways than one. A good deal of dialogue was taken from actual Presidential transcripts, which made watching it even more impressive. Looking at it from today's eyes, 'Thirteen Days' is a knockout.Donaldson focuses the film right where it should be - in the White House and in conference rooms, giving us only the subplot of Kenny O'Donnell's family life. For those posters who commented that O'Donnell was perhaps not a real person, yes, he was. It's impossible for me to believe that with a film that goes into so much detail and strove to be so factual, someone thought there was a made-up character. Try Google next time. Ken O'Donnell headed up Kennedy's presidential campaign and was appointed his Special Assistant when Kennedy won the White House. He was the most powerful of the President's advisers.Several things become clear about the goings-on at the White House in 1962: None of the military leaders thought the Kennedy administration belonged in the White House; if it had been up to the military leaders, the situation would have caused World War III; JFK turned himself into a pretzel in order to pursue a diplomatic solution to the potential conflict. Though discouraged almost at every turn, JFK still would not allow the shooting to begin, pushing instead for an embargo against Cuba.There is plenty of tension and excitement in this film. One of the best scenes is Commander Eckerd (Christopher Lawford) and his team low-flying over Cuba taking photos, and a U-2 pilot trying to avoid missiles chasing him. But most of the tension and excitement takes place in the meetings as the President and RFK struggle for answers and play for time. The mix is therefore ideal: drama, some aerial excitement, and a little humor as Adlai Stevenson gets the better of the Russians in an OAS meeting.There's also a look at the reaction of the country - also very accurate. Yes, people piled into church, cleared the grocery shelves of everything, and stocked fallout shelters. We all watched the President on television. In fact, as he talked, my mother thought he was about to declare war. It was a terrifying time.Kenny O'Donnell's role in all of this may have been somewhat exaggerated to make it a palatable role for Kevin Costner. Costner does okay in the part. Boston accents are very difficult to do without them sounding put on. It's very difficult to do accents in general and make them organic to the character. A few have succeeded: Anne Bancroft in 'The Miracle Worker,' Paul Newman in 'Somebody Up There Likes Me,' little Natalie Wood in 'Tomorrow is Forever,' Travolta in 'Saturday Night Fever,' and of course there are others. Jane Seymour and Joan Collins can easily pull off being Americans. All British actors can do a southern accent, since the southern accent started off as a British accent. Costner lays it on too thick and it's a distraction. But he certainly isn't bad in the role.The casting people merely wanted to suggest JFK and RFK. In Steven Culp, they found a young actor with similar features to RFK. He does an effective job, given that it's tough going to portray such a famous person. The most successful in the film is Bruce Greenwood as JFK, who tries to keep the accent from overpowering the dialogue. In the President's television speech, I'm sure he imitated JFK's every single inflection and pause, and it's perfect. His JFK is a listener, very dependent on his brother's advice, and one who takes the burdens of the country on his shoulders like a cross. One of the posters here mentioned something to the effect that 'we are led to believe that JFK leaned heavily on his advisors' as if this is a negative. Of course he did. Of course any President does or should. The final decisions belonged to him, and he had to be sure of all of the ramifications. Only an idiot doesn't hear every single opinion of value before he decides to launch World War III.The camaraderie between RFK, JFK, and O'Donnell is as unmistakable as their arguments and frustrations.Thirteen months after the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK would be dead and O'Donnell would be riding behind him in the Secret Service Car. After a particularly tough meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, O'Donnell insists that JFK sit for a minute, and JFK finally does. Worn out and not sleeping well, he laments about being President. 'I just thought there would be more good days.' In the end, we - and he - would have settled for just MORE days.",8,56,62,12 February 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," disappointing
","Having just staggered through Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, I perhaps saw 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' at the wrong time. My sisters especially are big fans of Colin Firth so I rented this.The story is about a teen from London (Taron Egerton) called 'Eggsy' who is chosen to interview as a professional spy for a secret group called the Kingsmen. They eliminate applicants during the 'interview' -- which is actually a series of treacherous attacks, etc. -- until there is one left standing. 'Kingsman' is reminiscent of The Avengers on TV and 007. It has some very funny scenes, particularly toward the end, and clever dialogue throughout.The violence was very cartoon-like, but I still didn't like it and found it too much and too graphic. I admit I'm not a big fan of violence, but I'll put up with it for something like 'The Godfather' - -- not for this. Lots of explosions and clever spy devices, with good performances by Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, and Egerton. Look for Mark Hamill -- see if you can find him without knowing which character he plays.",6,3,6,1 January 2016
Green Book," delightful
","This film was inspired by the true story of Tony the Lip Villelonga, An Italian-American bouncer (Mortenson) from the Bronx who gets a job driving a black. highly educated and cultured musician (Ali) through the south in 1962.Really a must-see film for the performances of everyone involved, for a good look at what it was like for blacks in the south, an amazing look at Bronx Italian life, and some great music.The title refers to 'The Negro Motorist Green Book,' which advised African-Americans traveling where they could eat and stay.The real Tony the Lip, by the way, played Carmine in The Sopranos. And great to see my favorite comedian, Maniscalco, in a movie role as Mrs. Villelonga's brother.Funny, warm, poignant, delightful film with wonderful characters - perfect for the holidays. Don't miss it.The title and subject matter are a reference to 'The Negro Motorist Green Book,' also known as 'The Negro Travelers' Green Book.' Published from 1936-1966, the guide helped African-American travelers find lodging, restaurants, and other businesses that would serve them. It eventually covered most of North America, plus Bermuda and the Caribbean.Funny, warm, and poignant film with wonderful characters - perfect for the holidays. Don't miss it.",10,6,14,14 December 2018
Pineapple Express," stoner movie
","Seth Rogen and James Franco star in 'Pineapple Express,' a 2008 film, directed by David Gordon Green and co-written by Rogen.Rogen and Franco are Dale Denton and Saul Silver, two potheads. Saul is a dealer and has some exciting new stuff called Pineapple Express. He gives Dale a preview. Unfortunately Dale witnesses a murder of a drug kingpin and drops his roach at the murder site. Since no one else has this new grass, the murderers (Gary Cole and Rosie Perez) put things together pretty easily. Soon, Dale and Saul are on the run, stoned out of their minds.While this film doesn't beat the insanity of 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,' it comes pretty close. Rogen and Franco are hilarious together. They have great chemistry. The scene with the cell phones in the woods is a killer and really had me laughing. They're so stoned they barely know their names throughout. Dale's appearance at his teenage girlfriend's house is another scream. The ending is actually quite exciting and while violent, it's been set up so that the violence is actually more comic book than disturbing.Lots of very funny moments in this. I think we can all remember a time in our youth when we were so out of it, from booze or grass, that we couldn't quite focus but tried. These guys project that feeling beautifully in excellent performances.",6,1,3,5 November 2013
Jackie Brown," an homage to an earlier genre
","Quentin Tarantino does a magnificent job with 'Jackie Brown,' a rich film that hearkens back to the black exploitation films like 'Foxy Brown' that gave Pam Grier, the star of this film, her start.Though the plot of 'Jackie Brown' is wonderful, the characters make this film worth watching. Pam Grier, an actress of remarkable presence and special beauty, plays a flight attendant caught between gun merchant Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), for whom she transports money, and two ambitious detectives portrayed by Michael Keaton and Mark Dugas. She decides to go for a con of her own and enlists the aid of her bail bondsman (Robert Forster). Forster hails from my home town, and he is one who knows a lot about career ups and downs. He first made a splash in 'Reflections in a Golden Eye,' and when the reviews came out, he was doing construction work outside the newspaper office. The review was thrown to him. He was nominated for an Oscar for 'Jackie Brown,' playing a man at a crossroads. He's marvelous as a hard-working 56-year-old man who's seen it all, made his life choices, accepted what he has, and then falls hard for Grier.There are so many layers to the film and performances. The tone is laid back, natural, and conversational, and most of the acting is very underplayed. Jackson is great portraying an absolute horror show who bails people out so he can kill them before they give him up. DeNiro has only a few lines as Jackson's apparently easygoing, take it as it comes partner (and what comes at him is Bridget Fonda), shrugging and smoking pot through most of the film. Towards the end, he nearly steals the movie as his nerves creep up on him. It is an absolutely brilliant performance. Keaton is perfect as a hyper detective. But it's Grier, as a powerful, street-smart woman determined that she has had her last bad break, who captivates as Jackie Brown. The part is unusual, in that it's a lead role for a 44-year-old woman.Tarantino gives us the usual scenes shown from various characters' points of view, the violence you don't see coming, and a great sound track. Though not considered his best film, Jackie Brown is interesting, fun, and bittersweet. And hey, he gave some very good actors a second place in the sun.",8,1,3,2 October 2005
Gangs of New York," City on fire
","Martin Scorcese's 'Gangs of New York' takes us back to the 1860s in New York City to show gang rule, driven by greed and prejudice against immigrants, particularly the Irish. The film stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, and Liam Neeson.Into the corrupt world of the Five Points comes the adult Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio), who as a child witnessed his father Priest Vallon (Neeson) murdered by Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis) who detests the Irish. Amsterdam infiltrates Bill the Butcher's organization, with the idea of killing the Butcher when the time is right.Everything about this film is impressive, and that's putting it mildly. The scope of it is so enormous, it makes 'Gone with the Wind' look like a small independent film. Scorcese and his actors have captured the 1860s atmosphere - the locations, the filth, the conditions, the brutality, the costumes, the language - to complete perfection. This is all set amidst the background of Tamany Hall and thousands of immigrants in search of a better life coming off of ships, only to have things thrown at them, while the young men are conned into becoming soldiers.The acting ranges from great to good. Daniel Day-Lewis is terrifying as The Butcher. Every scene in which he appears is tension-filled, because you as a viewer have no clue what he's going to do - stay calm or cut somebody to pieces. A madman. A brilliant performance. Leonardo DiCaprio as a young man who has to stifle his horrible anger is excellent. Cameron Diaz is effective but not as strong as she perhaps could have been as a pickpocket who falls for Amsterdam but has a history with the Butcher. One has to give her credit for continually stretching her talent in different projects. Here, she's in the presence of giants, so if she doesn't come off as well, it's to be expected.Get ready for a lot of blood and gore. Not my kind of thing, but it's worth sitting through it for this amazing film.",9,1,3,2 January 2010
Spectre," too long at the fair, 007
","Time to retire this franchise.Big budget boredom - 007 is like Ol' Man River - he just keeps rolling along, but in the case of 007, this franchise has had it. My advice: After the first truly electrifying 13 minutes, turn this off and keep your happy memories. In this one, Bond goes rogue after receiving a message from the beyond, in a way. He infiltrates a secret meeting and learns about the evil group SPECTRE. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, there's a new M (Ralph Fiennes) and a merger with MI5 and a decision to kill the Double O program. Might be a good idea, in fact.Madeleine Swan (Lea Seydoux), the daughter of an old enemy, may have the clue to finishing off SPECTRE. A good cast includes, besides Craig, Fiennes, and Seydoux, Christopher Waltz as the head of SPECTRE and Sherlock's Moriarity on PBS, Andrew Scott, one of the best of the new crop of British actors.But all that doesn't help the script. That great budget and no one can write an exciting story. Car chases, sex with women Bond met 2 minutes ago, cartoon villains, torture - it's all there in small enough doses to make the 2-1/2 hours go by like the original Birth of a Nation. I've seen Craig on stage twice - he's wasted here. About as exciting as flipping channels with a remote.",6,1,1,10 January 2017
Joy," I'm in trouble again
","I guess I'll be in trouble for liking this film, directed by David O. Russell and starring Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Robert de Niro, Virginia Madsen, Elizabeth Rohm, Diane Ladd, and Isabella Rossellini.I wanted to see this film for several reasons. First, I liked American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook, with the same star actors and directed by Russell.Secondly, we have Joy's Huggable Hangers, and I have a friend who owns all of her products.Third, I run a website for the soap opera General Hospital, and three of the actors are in the film...playing soap actors.This is her story, and to me anyway, it's an impressive one. When the story opens, she's a divorced mother of two with her ex-husband living in the basement, and she works for an airline. Her mother stays in her room all day watching soap operas, a father who has just moved in with her, and she has a grandmother who thinks Joy is going to achieve great things.It's the story of somebody coming from nothing and creating great success, the underdog who gets the American dream against all odds.Jennifer Lawrence is such a likable and pretty actress, it's no wonder she constantly captivates her audience. She rings true as a harried mother in a house that's falling around her and a father that loses his temper and breaks things. When Joy faces defeat, you really feel for her. Right now, she's the ingénue of the month, as once Meg Ryan, Julia Roberts, Gwenyth Paltrow, Rene Zwelleger, Anne Hathaway, etc. - in everything. The question is, can she grow into leading lady roles? I think so. We won't see her as much as we will be seeing Bradley Cooper, he being a man, but she'll be around.Bradley Cooper is another one, one of the most likable actors ever. His character runs his business with a velvet glove rather than an iron fist - he's not a screaming bombastic man, but he knows what he wants and demands it.The rest of the cast all turned in fine performances, with Isabella Rossellini as her father Pat's (de Niro's) girlfriend.Entertaining and also inspiring, this is a sweet film with no CGI, no nudity, and no profanity. No wonder people hate it.This isn't Citizen Kane, it isn't Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It's a simple, sometimes sentimental story of a woman who never gave up.",7,3,10,30 December 2015
The Breakfast Club," wonderful John Hughes film
","John Hughes wrote and directed this '80s film, 'The Breakfast Club,' starring some young up and comings: Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, John Kapelos, and Paul Gleason.The story concerns five high school students who are forced by the principal (Gleason) to serve detention for eight hours on a Saturday and to write an essay on who they think they are. There's the troublemaker/big mouth, John Bender (Nelson) who manages to end up with something like two months of Saturday's worth of detention by the time he's done; the rich, pretty girl, Claire Standish (Ringwald), a strange girl who makes noises but doesn't speak, Allison (Sheedy), a nerd, Brian (Hall), and and the sports star (Estevez).They're not supposed to talk but of course they do, and at first, this takes the form of insults. Then they start sneaking around, smoking dope, talking about their families, their problems, and their secrets, and before you know it, they have all formed some sort of a connection.This is such a wonderful film, about kids who for one reason or another, feel like outcasts and find out that just about everyone does feel like an outcast in high school. The things they hide behind are stripped away and the real people are exposed.The acting is wonderful, with top honors going to Nelson, who without a doubt has the showiest role, and Estevez, who delivers a powerful monologue at the end. You could have knocked me over with a feather when I realized that this young blond kid was Anthony Michael Hall, whom I only knew from Dead Zone - but there was no mistaking that face. Paul Gleason is a riot as the harried principal, who feels totally out of touch with the students.Highly recommended - The Breakfast Club is one of the best youth films of the '80s or ever probably, with the great John Hughes touches that help make it a remarkable experience for the viewer.",8,1,1,15 March 2013
Donnie Darko," Wow! A real refrigerator talk film
","Hitchcock used to talk about moviegoers who would come home, take some cold chicken out of the icebox, and talk about what they'd just seen. He called it refrigerator talk. Well, in the computer age, 'Donnie Darko' engenders a lot more than refrigerator talk. One can find endless discussion of this film on the Internet.On the face of it, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a schizophrenic teen on and off his meds. He takes orders from a giant bunny rabbit. Remember 'Harvey?' This is 'Harvey' standing on its big bunny ears - not a benign, invisible friend, but an evil-looking rabbit ordering Donnie to commit acts that cause chaos and even death.So is this is a wormhole movie, an indictment on the public school system (as the director says), or the story of a deeply disturbed young man with strange dreams? I don't know. Whatever it is, 'Donnie Darko' is a very provocative film and well worth viewing. It also has a great soundtrack that includes the intriguing song 'Mad World' - the Adam Lambert version of this song plays on 'General Hospital' every time James Franco walks on camera.Gyllenhaal is ably supported by Katharine Ross, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jenna Malone, and Noah Wylie.See it for yourself and make your own decisions: schizophrenic, dreamer, time traveler, all three - or something else? A fascinating film.",8,0,2,6 June 2010
The Social Network," Good ideas are in the universe'
","Admittedly I'm the wrong demographic for this movie. I find all the hoopla about it curious. It's a good film, absorbing, and I loved its various messages, but I was not blown away.The film purports to be the story of Mark Zuckerberg and his founding of Facebook. Like a lot of films based on a true story, it takes some liberties. Jesse Eisenberg does an excellent job as Zuckerberg, portrayed here as a brilliant young man who likes to create computer programs. When he creates Facebook, he encounters legal problems and comes up against former friends.I liked the points made in the film - it's not the person who has the idea -- it's the person who takes the idea and makes it a commercial success who is rewarded. The person we remember is the one who takes something and makes it a go. The other point is, when it comes to money, everything else flies out the window. That includes friendship and loyalty. It shows us that business decisions are cut and dried, bottom line events.The acting is natural and low key, and though this story could have been deadly, it moves at a decent pace and at least kept me interested. I was sort of expecting Citizen Kane and instead I got something several notches below. That's the problem with seeing something after everyone else has seen it. But I can certainly see its appeal to the younger generation.",8,1,2,28 May 2011
The Wedding Singer," Cute, warm film
","Adam Sandler is one of those performers, like Jim Carrey, that one either likes or doesn't. However, over the years, he's taken on a variety of roles, and his comedy isn't always the same, either. 'The Wedding Singer' is not a typical Adam Sandler film that found great popularity from a wide audience. I certainly didn't expect to like it, but I did.Set in the '80s, Sandler is Robbie Hart, once an aspiring singer/songwriter who sings at weddings and has an knack for livening up the festivities. Both Robbie and Julia are planning to get married to other people, but fate intervenes. For one thing, Robbie's intended Linda doesn't appear at their wedding (she met him when he was the lead singer in a rock band and now that he's doing receptions, the bloom is off the rose) and Julia's Wall Street broker boyfriend is a jerk. Robbie agrees to help Julia with her wedding, and then finds out that Julia's fiancée is marrying her out of duty because she dated him when he was poor. On top of which, he cheats.Both leads are wonderful, make a great couple, and the film is a lot of fun. The idea of '80s nostalgia in 1998 is funny as well. The film is bright and it's briskly directed by Frank Coraci.'The Wedding Singer' is highly entertaining and has a lot of warmth. See it. Great fun.",7,1,1,11 April 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," Never give up
","A father and salesman is in 'The Pursuit of Happiness' in this 2006 film starring Will Smith, Thandie Newton, and Jaden Smith. This is the real-life story of Chris Gardner, who was eking out a living selling bone density scanners while his wife (Newton) worked double shifts at a hospital. They weren't making it financially. One day Gardner sees a man get out of fancy car and asks him how he made it. The man says he's a stockbroker. Chris applies to the Dean Witter Reynolds apprentice program, unaware that there's no salary. He gets in by being terribly persistent. Then his wife leaves him, and Chris insists that their son (Jaden Smith) be left with him.'Pursuit of Happiness' is a very warm and above all, a very inspiring story about family, determination, and never letting go of one's dream. Very few people, I think, could or would have tolerated what Gardner did in order to make a better life for himself and his son. The two were homeless on and off, and those scenes are devastating. The apprentice program takes 20 people, and only one is chosen, yet Chris goes for it, bringing everything he owns to work when he had no place to live. How he holds it together and talks to clients and makes contacts is incredible. Frankly, if this weren't a true story, I would still have liked it but wondered how possible any of it even was.Will Smith has proved himself an excellent actor in the past - the way he completely submerged his personality into Mohammed Ali is a good example. Here, he's a charming, bright person who is always a day late and a dollar short. Through Smith's performance, one can feel Gardner's pain, frustration, and joy.The film's message is clear - the brick walls aren't there to keep you out, they're there to keep out the people who don't really want to get to the other side. And family is everything. In his pursuit of happiness, Chris Gardner goes after his dream on his own terms, integrity and humor intact, relentlessly, all the while knowing that the most important thing is the little boy at his side.",8,0,0,22 June 2009
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," loads of fun
","'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' was made in 1989 and bristles with excitement, humor, suspense, special effects and, as a real plus, character development. In the beginning we get to see young Indy (River Phoenix) and where he got his fear of snakes, etc., and we meet his father, Henry Jones (Sean Connery), a brilliant professor.In this story, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) leaves his teaching job to again save the world from the Nazis. They have kidnapped Indy's father for his diary. The Nazis seek nothing less than the Holy Grail, for which Henry Jones has maps and notations in his diary which can lead to it. The Holy Grail here is a chalice used by Jesus at the Last Supper, received by Joseph of Arimathea and said to possess miraculous powers. Joseph used the Grail to catch Christ's blood while interring him. It's up to Indy to free his father.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade takes the audience on a thrilling journey to Venice, Austria, Germany and remote locations. The film never lets up its fast pace and around every corner, there's a special effect, or funny dialogue, or a brilliant escape.The great cast also includes Julian Glover, John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott, and Alison Doody.",9,3,5,27 December 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," Top-notch thriller, with Jason Bourne on the run
","As a follow-up to the excellent 'The Bourne Identity,' we have 'The Bourne Supremacy,' with Matt Damon reprising the role of ex-government assassin Jason Bourne. This time, two years later, Bourne, suffering from amnesia, is trying to find out who first tried to murder him and succeeded only in killing his girlfriend, and who then framed him for murder by placing his fingerprint at the scene of a CIA operation gone bad.This is a dizzying movie - literally, as the camera never seems to stop moving. What elevated 'The Bourne Identity' was its ability to surprise and shock the audience by a sudden turn of events in a scene -'The Bourne Supremacy' retains that with heart-stopping effect. As Bourne investigates his old group, his memory comes back to him in spurts, sometimes at inopportune moments, but he still proves he's sharp at the game. Somehow we're drawn into Bourne's paranoia and feel it ourselves - this is particularly true in the hotel scene. The long subway station scene, as he leaps from track to track, is great. The viewer also gets to see a lot of Berlin during the movie.Matt Damon is fantastic as Jason Bourne, a confused man who possesses visceral killer and survival instincts. Joan Allen is excellent as the director of the blown operation who believes Bourne is responsible. All the performances are, in fact, top drawer.Directed at a brisk pace by Paul Greengrass, 'The Bourne Supremacy' is a superior example of the spy thriller genre.",8,3,4,26 April 2006

","Leonardo DiCaprio is 'The Great Gatsby' in this 2013 version of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, where the rich are different from you and me. The film also stars Toby Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Elizabeth DiBicki, and Isla Fisher.Directed by Baz Luhrmann, with costume design by his wife, Catherine Martin, the production is an absolute feast for the eyes, brilliantly beautiful, exaggerated, over the top, and spectacular. The big screen is the only place to see it. The lavishness represents the '20s atmosphere, and I noticed that some of the female party performers were cast according to the look back then - bigger legs, curvier, which is correct for the time period. There was the flat flapper look back then as well which was also represented. Luhrmann again uses the conceit of anachronistic music. It didn't bother me in Moulin Rouge, and it didn't bother me here.I'm an old timer, so I saw the 1974 version on the screen not once, but twice, because a friend of mine returned from Europe and hadn't seen it. Since it was extremely heavily publicized, he wanted to, so I went again.I'm unclear as far as what people's memories of it are -- some people on IMDb seem to think it was a great classic. That isn't how I remember it, either seeing it or in the reviews. Robert Redford was terrible, too cerebral, and Mia Farrow was worse. It was a beautiful looking film, and it had Sam Waterston as Nick, who got the only good reviews. His performance completely stomps on the miscast Toby Maguire's here. Luhrmann's instinct, to cast both Daisy and Jay as very youthful and fresh, flopped when it came to casting Nick. As the narrator, he needs to be more mature and less homespun.Both Mulligan and DiCaprio had an innocence in their performances, with DiCaprio giving a real powerhouse performance, embodying the idea of hopefulness, passion, illusion, and desperation. And he looks spectacular.I haven't yet seen my perfect Daisy. It's not Mulligan, though she's a good actress and gave Daisy a naiveté and a frailty. Mia Farrow captured the airhead part, which was emphasized in that film, and she had the beauty. I guess I never felt that either one was portraying a southern girl during that period. I thought Joel Edgerton made an effective Tom.Baz Luhrmann is a visual genius, and I love his films, going back to Strictly Ballroom. I felt here he was fairly reverent when it came to the material and if it was a touch over the top, it certainly makes for a theater-going experience. The emphasis here is on the mystery of who Gatsby is, but he doesn't neglect the poignancy and the message of the piece. The rich are different from you and me.",9,3,7,31 May 2013
The Proposal," Lighter than air, and sometimes, that's okay
","Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds star in 'The Proposal,' a 2009 Anne Fletcher film also starring Betty White, Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen. Bullock plays editor Margaret Tate, an uberbitch, who is about to be deported back to Canada due to a visa snafu. She forces her assistant, Andrew Paxton (Reynolds) to announce their engagement. After an extremely uncomfortable meeting with a no-nonsense man from immigration who smells a rat (Denis O'Hare), Margaret and Andrew have no choice but to travel to Paxton's family home in Alaska to announce their engagement. It's a little more than Margaret bargained for.Totally predictable and typical Sandra Bullock fare on the style of 'Two Weeks Notice' - however, Bullock excels at this type of romantic comedy and is always a joy to watch. There is a fun performance by Betty White as a 90-year-old grandmother who prays to the Indian spirits, and Oscar Nunez as Ramone, the only exotic dancer in town.Without Bullock's warmth, charm, and honest emotions, this film would have been a real dud. Obviously, I'm a fan. Bullock started out as one of the flavors of the month about 16 years ago, and at 45, her output of films hasn't diminished. Like one of the classic film stars of the '30s and '40s, who all did their share of fair or bad movies, she can make just about anything enjoyable.",7,0,1,24 November 2009
Sully," 'I've flown for 42 years. I'm being judged on 208 seconds.'
","'Sully' from 2016 is based on the true story of pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger's dramatic landing of a plane carrying 155 people in the Hudson River when birds attacked his engines in 2009. I can still see the photos of the passengers standing on the wings waiting to be picked up. Naturally Hollywood grabbed the story immediately.Sully (Tom Hanks) is hailed as a hero. He doesn't seem to be one born for the spotlight -- he's a quiet person who really felt like he was just doing his job. But behind the scenes and the pictures of him as a hero, Sully's actions become the subject of a tense NTSB investigation.When the plane had to make an emergency landing, he was told to head for LaGuardia, but Sully said that the plane would not make it. The NTSB disputes this by performing simulations, and also states that one of the engines was still working. Sully felt he had no choice but to make his landing strip the Hudson River.Sully demands to see the simulations and also insists the second engine, so far lost at sea, was not working. His copilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) backs him up, and more importantly, no one was seriously injured. Very good film, if on the slow side, and it's not very exciting. It is, however, interesting and absorbing as we watch Sully attempt to prove that he was right, and insisting that the simulations are done in the same time frame as he had piloting the plane.Tom Hanks gives a good, reserved performance of someone whom greatness was thrust upon, a man who loved his work and was proud of it. Laura Linney has a small part as his wife. If Hanks' performance is subtle, so is Eastwood's direction, emphasizing the humanity of the story rather than going for over the top moments or big music. Truly an excellent job.",7,1,1,30 December 2016
Beetlejuice," Tim Burton ghost story
","There's nothing new about ghost stories, or even married couples who are ghosts, but there's only one Tim Burton. Here, in 1988's 'Beetle Juice,' he puts his own zany, delightful spin on a ghost story, complete with ghosts who try scaring people with sheets over their heads.Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) die when their car goes over a cliff, and, returning to their house, they soon realize they didn't survive the crash. One hint was no reflections in the mirror. They find a handbook for the recently deceased. They also find a family, the Deetzes, moving into their house (Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and the goth-foreshadowing Winona Ryder). Adam and Barbara want the people out of their house, and when they meet their counselor from the other side (Sylvia Sidney), they learn they have to stay in the house for 125 years. They realize that they have to scare the Deetzes away. Though they have been warned against contacting the zombie Betelguese (Michael Keaton), they need help, so they call upon him. If he can't help them get rid of the Deetzes, no one can.Bizarre, crazy film with all kinds of colorful effects and Harry Belafonte music. My mother was a great fan of Belafonte and saw him in concert; we had every one of those recordings. It was great fun hearing them again in some hilarious situations! Strangely, the actual Betelgeuse character is a small role, but Keaton is so bombastic and wild, it's enough. He's excellent. The focus of the story is on Baldwin and Davis, who are attractive and very believable as a married couple. Sylvia Sidney, Dick Cavett, and Robert Goulet have small roles, and they're all great. This was a breakout film for Winona Ryder, the only Deetz who can see the ghosts. She does a standout job, and Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones are appropriately 'out there' as Mr. and Mrs. Deetz.Few people have Tim Burton's sensibility or imagination. Sometimes I'm not sure if that's a bad thing, but there's no doubt that he's never boring. In anyone else's hands, this would have been an amusing movie. In Burton's hands, it's highly unusual.",7,1,3,27 October 2009
Valkyrie," Very good
","Great production values, historical accuracy, and fine acting can be found in 'Valkyrie,' a 2008 film starring Tom Cruise, Terrance Stamp, Tom Wilkinson, Kenneth Branagh, and Eddie Izzard. Tom Cruise played Claus von Stauffenberg, and one of the actors in a small role is actually von Stauffenberg's grandson. In the movie, Claus' wife Nina (Carice von Houten) is pregnant with the actor's mother.There's no point in going through the story - it was one of something like 15 plots to assassinate Hitler, and the third try for von Stauffenberg,a man from a well-known family and a strict Catholic who never became a member of the Nazi party.Two points, both referenced in a review on this site. The reviewer who wrote that kids walked out of the movie saying they were surprised by it because they thought Hitler was going to die - shame on their teachers. It reminds me of the review of '13 Days' on this site that said the Kenny O'Donnell character, one of Kennedy's most important advisors, played by Kevin Costner, was fictional. Right, and they used White House transcripts and just stuck him in there. It is awful, I agree.The second point, referenced by the same reviewer and undoubtedly by others, was about the accents. I'm going to disagree on that point, though I get what he was saying - everyone should have been British or American, not some of both.The acting rule is, when people are in their native country, such as Germans in Germany, it's assumed they're speaking their own language, not English with an accent. Therefore, one doesn't need an accent. As far as having both Brits and Americans in the cast, I refer you to 'Das Boot' which was in German, but some of the actors were from Austria, some of them were from varying parts of Germany - in short, lots of dialects. So to have people speaking English in a movie where there are different accents is really quite realistic.Though, if you know anything at all about history, you know how this movie ends, it's still very suspenseful. I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise - I find his acting very external most of the time - but he does okay, he isn't afraid to surround himself with excellent people, and his makeup is perfect. I thought the film looked authentic (though black and white is always better for films set in the '40s), and, from what I've read, historically right on, including the big scene where von Stauffenberg puts his plan in motion.Someone else commented that Americans can't understand the enormity of what von Stauffenberg was planning, and therefore, the film doesn't work, but again, I disagree. As a viewer, I certainly felt the terror and the enormity of the plan. One had to be really desperate to agree to it. And plenty of Germans were.",8,2,2,5 July 2009
All the President's Men," seen this many times, never reviewed
","In today's world, 'All the President's Men' is as timely as ever. And it's a great look at the importance of journalistic integrity at a time when it was important to be right, not first.A meticulously made film, and Redford and Hoffman were at the heights of their careers and both so adorable! The cast was perfect, with Hal Holbrook as Deep Throat, Jason Robards as Ben Bradlee, Jack Warden - all brilliant.The break-in, as we see, was a mess. In preparation for the break-in, someone had gone around the Democratic headquarters and put tape on all the doors so they wouldn't lock automatically. One of the first things you see is a guard finding one of the taped doors - that was the actual guard, and he was considered the hero of the night. One of the Republican plans was that during the convention, a yacht with prostitutes would be nearby; the Republicans would lure delegates onto the yacht and then blackmail them later. The interesting thing is how all of the people involved had no problem committing actual felonies - blackmail, embezzling, perjury, and one of the most powerful moments in the documentary is the TAPE of Nixon saying he knew where he could get a million in cash to pay people off. It was all like something out of The Sopranos, with John Mitchell threatening to put Katherine Graham's tit in a wringer if anything was published about him. Astonishing. And this was The White House.Woodward and Bernstein were like dogs with a bone, beautifully shown here as they continually pursue a story originally thought of as a waste, later called a witch hunt, and finally above-the-title news.I'm older now, obviously, than when Nixon resigned. It was hard for me to see him as a person then. Later on, transcribing his speeches and an interview - I realized that he was an amazing speaker, and his career had been absolutely brilliant. I pity him that he felt he had to do what he did. And then I remember his comments about Jews and artists on those tapes. A very complicated man who let his dark side take over.The film doesn't dwell on that, but on what Redford wanted - the mechanics of the investigation itself, the grunt work that went into getting the story.Some trivia: After this film, there was a large increase in the number of applicants to journalism schools. I'd like to point out that this took place after the movie - not the book.",10,22,24,17 June 2017
The Soloist," beautiful performances highlight this true story
","'The Soloist' from 2009 is based on a true story and stars Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx. An LA Times columnist, Steve Lopez (Downey), is in need of a story in 2005, shortly after smashing his face up in a bicycle accident. One day he discovers Nathaniel Ayers (Foxx), a homeless man who plays the violin. Steve decides he would make a good story.As he writes his articles, Lopez learns more about Ayers. He has a sister who loves him (LisaGay Hamilton) and is concerned about him; his original instrument was the cello. The stories bring all kinds of attention to the problem of homelessness, to Lopez himself, and to the gifted Ayers, and a cello is actually donated to him. He loves to play his music in the tunnels, doesn't like to be inside, and idolizes Beethoven. In flashbacks, we see bits of his life which appear to be a loving mother and no father, and we see a truck on fire, which was part of his trauma.Nathaniel's plight does a lot for Steve Lopez, and though he is someone who shies away from commitment, he wants to help him. But in reaching out, he experiences the hurt and pain that often comes from dealing with the mentally ill, in this case, schizophrenia.The film asks a few questions: can a person who refuses medication be forced to take it; does every homeless person want to be in a home; and why in such a rich country do we have so many homeless (90,000 in Los Angeles as of 2009).Lopez works to understand the talented Nathaniel, and Nathaniel begins to see him as a true friend. Both are needy people and not particularly trusting. But true freedom comes in facing one's demons.Wonderful film about courage and understanding.",8,0,0,17 December 2016
High Fidelity," a record store owner has women trouble
","John Cusack stars in 'High Fidelity,' a 2000 film directed by Stephen Frears and also featuring Jack Black, Iben Hjele, Todd Louiso, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joan Cusack, and Lisa Bonet.High Fidelity is about a record store owner, Rob (Cusack) who expresses his thoughts verbally throughout the film. Those thoughts mainly have to do with his failed relationships. And there have been many.He's hilarious and totally obsessive. When his ex-girlfriend Laurie (Iben Hjele) tells him that she hasn't slept with his old upstairs neighbor and her new boyfriend Ian (Tim Robbins) yet, it drives him crazy. In the record store, he asks one of the guys who works for him, Barry (Black), 'If I told you I hadn't seen The Evil Dead yet, would you think I was going to?' An argument ensues. 'But you have seen it,' Barry says. 'I'm confused - why would you ask me if you were going to see a movie you've already seen twice?' The scenes that take place in the record store between Rob, Barry, and Dick (Barry and Dick are part-timers who show up every day) and their top five lists are priceless.Eventually Rob's focus on his ex-girlfriends and his stalking of Laura and her new boyfriend Ian evolves into questions about his life and his level of commitment, not just to women, but to life itself.There's nothing new about men who fantasize about ideal relationships while they're in a real one, nothing new about men who can't make a commitment, but there's something so fresh about High Fidelity - the interesting characters, the music, and the wonderful acting.Jack Black nearly walks away with the film. He has some of the best dialogue, too, and I will only say, wait until the end of the movie. Though Todd Louiso has a less showier role, he's no less funny, and he's created a music nerdy type character, quiet but no less passionate.John Cusack is adorable as an exhausted, frustrated suitor, and it's understandable that Rob has attracted so many attractive women. Holding onto one is his problem. Iben Hjele as Laura, his last girlfriend, had something about her that reminded me of Scarlett Johansson, her mannerisms perhaps, but she was charming and did an excellent job. What can I say - everyone was good.Don't miss this, no matter what. A wonderful message about living your life instead of dreaming, and learning what's possible.",9,0,2,14 June 2013
Atonement," a child's anger and jealousy ruins lives
","Keira Knightley and James McAvoy star in 'Atonement,' a 2007 film directed by Joe Wright, with a screenplay by Christopher Hampton, based on the novel by Ian McEwan.Briony Tallis is a 13-year-old girl in 1935 and an aspiring writer. She has a crush on the housekeeper's son Robbie (McAvoy) and at one point, jumps into the river so that he can save her. Robbie isn't amused - in fact, he's very angry, and Briony realizes that he'll never love her. From her bedroom window she sees her sister Cee (Knightley) and Robbie fighting.The Tallis family is being visited by cousins whose parents are in the process of getting a divorce, twin boys and their 15-year-old sister Lola. Briony's brother Leon (Patrick Kennedy) brings home a very wealthy friend, Paul (Benedict Cumberbatch) for dinner. He meets the twins and Lola, and it's obvious that Lola thinks he's cute.Robbie meanwhile has written a letter to Cee, discarding the first draft which is very sexually explicit, and replacing it. He asks Briony to deliver it. Briony reads it; she has the wrong letter, in fact. She thinks Robbie is a sex maniac. When Robbie appears for dinner, Cee and Robbie have a confrontation which leads to them having sex up against a bookcase. Briony walks in on them.While everyone is at dinner, the twin boys disappear, and everyone goes out to look for them. Just as Briony comes upon Lola, a man runs away from her prone body. Lola has been molested. Briony accuses Robbie.Thus begins the ruination of lives in this beautifully directed and photographed film. Robbie goes to prison. His mother (Brenda Blethyn) is devastated. In 1939 he is given a chance to either stay in prison or enter the army, which he does. Cee's father was going to finance his going to medical school; he is now cut off. Cee knows Robbie is innocent and walks out on her family and becomes a nurse during the war. Briony (now Romola Garai) does the same.The question becomes, how much did Briony understand when she lied -- did she really believe her sister was being attacked by Robbie and that he was a sex maniac? Or was she jealous of her sister and Robbie and acted out of anger? The audience needs to decide.This film is filled with sadness and longing, with an idyllic beginning that ends in horror, and at the end, a final twist. As Briony must live with her burden and desire to atone, we are stuck with the results of her act and the havoc and heartbreak it causes.Keira Knightley is the perfect '30s young beauty here. In the beginning, she is a gorgeous woman from a wealthy family with probably no end of gentlemen callers - it's all ahead of her. Later she not only has to deal with the effects of the war but of the man she loves going to prison.James McAvoy does a wonderful job with a much showier role -- again, in the beginning, one is aware of his glowing youth and of him being in love; then he is dragged off to prison and ends up in the trenches.I must mention Benedict Cumberbatch in a small but pivotal role here, as I watched this film because of him. He's extremely dashing as Paul, and very charming. The film was made three years before he hit it big with Sherlock.The audience has to decide if there was any atonement as well as process the last half hour or so of this film, which comes as a surprise.An enchanting film showing the destructive power of a lie.",10,1,4,5 March 2013
