The Sound of Music," This movie was truly magical
","There was not one bad thing I could say about this movie, except the Capitan should not have challenged the small-witted Rolfe into almost having his whole family caught.  Other than that, this movie was truly wonderful. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer did a fantastic job.  Julie Andrews' could sing more beautiful than many other actressess could in those days; I don't blame her for suing that guy who screwed up her singing voice.  See this movie with your children, it's a real treat.  8 out of 10.",Null,0,6,1 March 2003
The Ring," Suspenseful
",Finally a suspenseful movie that is actually good!  This kept my attention through the whole movie.  you never knew what was coming up next; it kept you wondering.  This movie is worth watching for fun. 7.5 out of 10.,Null,0,0,7 March 2003
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Good, Clean Fun
","E.T. is one of the best movies Steven Speilberg has ever created!  It is the most imaginative, and funnest movie with lots of drama and good clean fun, which is not something you see now days.  This movie is for someone as young as 2 to the age of 99.  You could never hate this movie. 8.9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,11 May 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Prepare to be blown away
","Disney never ceases to amaze me.  'Pirates' is a humorous yet well-portrayed movie.  Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner are a kickass team in this movie of truth, honor, love, and adventure for the entire family!  8.8 out of 10.",9,0,0,10 July 2003
My Neighbor Totoro," I love this movie!
","This is one of the cutest movies I've ever seen!  I always loved the idea of the Tortoroes and magic and fantasy, and I love this movie.  This movie is for young and old and it will sure make you smile.  7.9 out of 10.",Null,0,1,8 September 2003
X-Men," X-Men
","I may not know a lot about the X-Men comic books and its characters, but I must say that this movie was pretty sweet.  All the characters were just right, especially Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewert.  This second X-men is going to be even better than the first. 8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,24 April 2003
Final Destination 2," A roller-coaster ride!
","Final Destination 2 is by far better than the first!  An on-the-edge-of-your-seat-roller-coaster-ride, FD2 delivers chills and spills that will leave you breathless! 8 out of 10!",Null,0,0,22 July 2003
Taxi Driver," Supreme
","*Potential spoilers* Taxi Driver starring the young, hunky Robert DiNiro and Jodie Foster is a supreme classic.  The movie could be so real it is almost surreal.  You can identify with DiNiro and know where he's coming from.  Everything looks real it's scary.  And with his famous line '...You talking to me...' DiNiro delivers an unforgettable in Taxi Driver!  8.8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,9 September 2003
Romeo + Juliet," Sexy, but not too cool
","when i say that this is not cool, i mean that they totally wrecked william shakespeare's classic about romeo and juliet.  it was not meant to be in a now a days sinopse.  yes, i'll admit that the casting was pretty good, and the acting and music too, but how does one explain mercutio going from being white to black?  one of the better versions of romeo and juliet is still the one with olivia hussey and leonard whiting. this version is fun and sexy, but they should have possibly let it alone. 7 out of 10.",Null,2,3,31 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Awesome Movie...
","This is one of the most amazing, shocking movies i've seen in a while. This movie was a great task, but Peter Jackson really made it into something special. I thought Elijah Wood was ok for the part of Frodo, but the others (especially Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortenson) were really good.  I thought the characters Sam and Frodo acted too much like they were in love though. All in all, the writing, the acting, the costumes, and the action with a hint of comedy and drama made the movie really good. 8.5 out of 10.",Null,0,0,20 February 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Why, God, why?!!!
","What in God's name were they thinking?!  I was so excited to see the conclusion to this trilogy, and was, of course, let down. The first two Matrix movies were awesome, but this one took had a brick tied to it when it plummeted off the deep end.  There were very (and I mean very) few moments when my interest was kept, but otherwise I found myself catching some winks in my seat.  Also, Revolutions didn't seem like a Matrix movie (it didn't have the feel).  They should have brought the evil twins back or something to help this movie.  In conclusion, watch the first two, and skip the third. 4.5 out of 10.",4,0,0,5 November 2003
Lilo & Stitch," Blue Punch Buggy Ride
","Lilo and Stitch turned out to be one of the most fun Disney movies in a while.  Though the monologe is misleading, the movie itself turns out to be a joyous blue punch buggy ride of family entertainment!  7.5 out of 10.",Null,0,1,18 June 2003
The Shining," Classic Modern Horror
",The Shining is a classic modern horror compared to the Alfred Hitchcock movies.  Jack Nicholson is a genius madman in The Shining. This movie by far is one of Stanley Kubrick's best as it comes into my top 5 horror flicks of all time!  Simple and scary! 8.3 out of 10.,Null,0,1,10 August 2003
The Patriot," More dramatic than Patriotic...
","The actors and movie plot were good in this movie, but this movie is not very patriotic.  The villain was well thought out and the plans were well in tact, but this should not be considered a patriotic movie. 7 out of 10.",Null,1,2,20 February 2003
Spirited Away," Wonderful, Magical!
","This is one of the most mystifying and wonderful movies I've seen this year! There were no flaws, and it was so lifelike and enchanting.  Every setting, every character, every voice put into the character's personalites were just perfect.  I loved this movie and hope to see more movies like this. 8.9 out of 10.",Null,0,1,23 April 2003
Dirty Dancing," Even I liked it!
","When I say 'Even I like it', that's saying alot.  I am not the type usually, for these types of movies, but I thought Dirty Dancing was a fun, energetic movie.  The acting was believable and decent, but the plot was a little flimsy.  And the funny part about Swayze and Grey as the lead lovers is that in real life, they could not stand one another! 7.9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,26 August 2003
Legends of the Fall," One of the saddest movies of all time!
","This movie made me cry more than any other movie I have ever seen!  Every time that music played, or anyone else in the movie cried, (which was often,) I cried.  The music, acting, and cinemotography were fantastic! This movie could make even the toughest person cry, and I am speaking from experience. 8 out of 10!",Null,3,4,11 March 2003
Legends of the Fall," A sad, but well done movie
","This was one of the most depressing and saddest movies ever.  This movie made me cry more than any other movie I've ever seen. Anthony Hopkins, Aiden Quinn, Henry Thomas, and Brad Pit presented wonderful performances.  The music and cinematography was wonderful as well. 8 out of 10.",Null,0,2,20 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Better than the first!
","This movie was better than the first and i bet the third part will be better than the first two!  Two Towers had alot more support, comedy, and action, not to mention the new characters that were introduced really spiced up the movie.  All of the actors (or creatures) really got into their roles and made this film a huge hit!  9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,20 February 2003
The Nightmare Before Christmas," One of the Best...
","This, in my opinion next to Beetlejuice and such, is one of Tim Burton's best movies.  I will admit that the story is stretched a little thin (like Jack), but still, this movie is pretty cool.  It's fun for everyone from kids to great- grandparents.  8.0 out of 10.",Null,0,1,8 August 2003
"Girl, Interrupted"," Intriging
","This was one of the best movies ive seen lately.  A true masterpiece that was actually based on a true story.  Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder were awesome, and the supporting cast was magnificent.  This movie is a must see and a must need for your movie collection. 8 out of 10.",Null,1,1,9 March 2003
A Clockwork Orange," Intriguing and Original
","Clockwork Orange is a very strange, intriguing, and original film based off of a semi-famous novel.  Starring Malcolm McDowell as the crazed Alex, he delivers a great performance that draws you into another dimension of freaky cool.  8.7 out of 10!",Null,0,0,20 August 2003
From Hell," Good Adaption
","*Spoilers* From Hell is a good adaption of the times of Jack the Ripper.  A very intelligent story line and logical reasoning moved this movie swiftly along. Performances by Johnny Depp as the inspector and Ian Holm as Jack the Ripper in particular were wonderful.  Didn't really care for Heather Graham's performance and I thought she should've died anyhow.  The ending pretty much sucked when Johnny lets himself go...what a waste.  Anyways, I give this movie a 7.9 out of 10.",Null,0,2,22 July 2003
Titanic," Masterpiece
","You can't love but to be drawn into the movie.  James Cameron really captured Titanic's essence and brought us into the movie, onto the ship. The iceberg scene and the scenes were the Titanic is sinking were very dramatic, suspensful, and upsetting. 8.5 out of 10 I give to this movie.",Null,1,2,21 February 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A fun movie for everyone
",Harry Potter is a really fun movie for anyone and everyone.  This is the first fantasy movie that's come out in a long time.  This is what the kid's have been waiting for. 7.5 out of 10.,Null,0,0,20 February 2003
Castle in the Sky," Spectacular!
","This movie is just as great as the other movies by this director such as Spirited Away.  This movie captures the spirit of imagination, and teaches you about love, bravery, cruelty, and honor.  The dubbed version was just awesome, and the casted voices from actors such as Mark Hamill, Anna Paquin, and James Van Der Beek were chosen perfectly for this peculiar role. Castle in the Sky will make a grand edition to your movie collection!  8.5 out of 10.",Null,4,6,20 May 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Awesome
","*Potential Spoilers* I will admit that the second one isn't as good as the first, but it is by all means, better than the third installment!  It has the Matrix feel, romance, humor, action, and a good story.  The best part in the movie by far, is the fight scene with Morpheus, Trinity, and the evil albino twins! They should have brought the twins to the third movie, then the movie wouldn't have been a total drag...  All in all, I give Matrix: Revolutions 8 out of 10, Matrix 8.3 out of 10, and Matrix: Revolutions 4 out of 10 (for the effort.)",9,0,0,11 November 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Mind was blown into micro chips
","The second Matrix was definately better than the first one.  The special effects, fight scenes, and writing was awesome!  Some of the scenes were alittle confusing, cuz i got lost, but the movie was still good.  Also, the ending sucks with the to be concluded.  those evil twins with the dreadlocks were also pretty cool.  I hope the 3rd one is even better, and is easier to follow.  8.5 out of 10.",9,0,0,18 May 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A Grand Adventure
","This  one was better than the first.  There was much more dedication in this than the first and Rupert Grint (Ron) definatly shined along with Daniel and Emma.  It's just a fun movie. The only thing is that by time the next movie comes out, these kids will be too old for the parts and won't want to do them.  They should have done them all together like the Lord of the Rings was done. 8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,20 February 2003
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Brilliant
","This movie is just sheer brilliance.  Starring Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a brilliant capture of people trying to make it by in a havoc mental hospital life.  If you liked the book, you'll love the movie.  8.6 out of 10!",Null,0,1,13 August 2003
X2: X-Men United," Better than Ever!
","When I thought this X-Men couldn't get any better-it did!  The action was great, the acting was great-for the most part because of the great chemistry between the actors, and the story was faithful as well.  Never a dull moment in this movie and the next one will be even better without a doubt! 8.8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,2 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," OH MY GOD!!!!
","Now this is what I'm talking about! We need more movies like this, but first we need more writers like Tolkien, for without we would not have the story of the One Ring.  This movie left me utterly speechless. The acting, the action, and the story will leave your heart pounding as it did I!  9.9 out of 10 for all three movies!",Null,0,0,17 December 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Good Ol' Classics!
","This movie is what horror movies are all about for Christ's sake!  This movie is everything that horror flicks nowadays are not!  It takes old humor, one-liners, a little nudity, and that old-fashioned gore that brings you into the movie, but doesn't sicken you or bore you.  A Nightmare On Elm Street is at a semi-classic as of horror movies besides movies like Psycho, and was a great start for others to learn about the issues of being scared. 8 out of 10!",Null,0,0,24 July 2003
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The director of the writer to this will be sacked!
","This movie was terribly funny!  It was not only annoying and funny, it was pure enjoyment of entertainment!  The bits in this movie were never doubled and thank god.  This movie is one of a kind and will be loved stilll for generations to come with its witty, obnoxious comedy.  8 out of 10.",Null,1,4,7 May 2003
Gangs of New York," Moving
","Gangs of New York is an epic of its time portraying the lives of whites, blacks, Irish, etc..., in their time.  Martin Scorcses (forgive my spelling mistakes) made an inspirational, moving, heart-throbbing, action packed movie that will be remembered.  Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Henry Thomas, and Cameron Diaz deliver unforgettable roles in this outstanding movie!  Gangs of New York receives an 8.8 out of 10 in my book.",Null,0,0,2 July 2003
Beetlejuice," Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!
","I don't know what people have against this movie now.  This is just a fun family movie.  Once again, a great cast headed by Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin, and Michael Keaton.  Keaton, once again proves my theory of him being a fun-loving, likeable guy.  Beetlejuice was just an entertaining movie, aside from its story-line. 7.7 out of 10.",Null,0,1,6 May 2003
