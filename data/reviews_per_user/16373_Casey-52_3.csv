The Blair Witch Project," One of the scariest movies I've ever seen
","Yes, the title of my comment is overused here already, but this movie really is very scary. I can't top most of the comments already said, but I just need to say that those people who think this is overhyped obviously need to consider their thoughts of horror films. If the fans of today expect a horror film like SCREAM (which is pretty pathetic), then of course they won't like this film. The audiences of today don't want to get involved in horror films, they don't want to think, it's sad but true! While watching this movie, you have to become involved with the movie, pay attention to everything, analyze the events that are happening, come to conclusions of your own. That is how you will really get scared. Let your imagination do the work or are you too lazy to do that?By the way, has anyone ever thought the events of the movie might never have happened, the filmmakers could have just imagined it all and gone insane because of isolation. Just a thought.",10,1,2,16 August 1999
The Thing," John Carpenter makes a classic sci-fi movie even better!
","Who knew in 1978 when we saw 1951's 'The Thing' on a TV set in John Carpenter's 'Halloween' that he would be remaking it 4 years later? 'The Thing' was the last film in Carpenter's succession of theatrical hits ('Assault on Precinct 13', 'Halloween', 'Escape from New York', 'The Fog', 'Halloween II'). Since then, Carpenter has only gotten worse, with his newest release 'Vampires' sucking REAL bad. But here, you see Carpenter at his peak, working in a claustrophobic isolated environment with a hopeless situation. The best thing about the movie are the special effects by Rob Bottin, who had done an excellent job with 'The Howling' a year earlier. The movie takes no time kicking into gear, with a graphic dog mutation setting the standard for what to expect in the next few hours. The highlight of the film is a soldier's head slipping away from his body and mutating into a spider!!! Now that the film has been re-released on video and DVD in a gorgeous widescreen print with long-lost footage, a whole new generation can enjoy the terror that is 'John Carpenter's The Thing'!",10,0,1,19 March 2000
Carrie," What more can be said about this classic?
","Of all the Stephen King big-screen adaptations, I find this to be the most entertaining, then 'Cujo' and 'The Shining' behind it. As my title says, what more can be said? This movie IS a classic, despite what some people say. Of course, 'Carrie' is more of a drama than it is a horror movie. The elements of horror are very underplayed until the last 20 minutes of the movie. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie should have won the Oscars in 1976! They were more than deserving and make the movie stand the test of time the most. If we depended on William Katt's white-boy Afro or Amy Irving's platform shoes, 'Carrie' would be forgotten. Yes, the hairdos, the clothes, and a lot of the lingo is very VERY dated, but fun to watch. Brian DePalma does his best directing, I think. The use of the split-screen is great, I love that technique! And of course the prom sequence. Who can forget it? I think every teenager in high school should be forced to watch this movie, then maybe indifferences wouldn't seem so significant anymore. This used to be my favorite movie when I was undergoing lots of personal problems in high school and I'm proud to say that I've seen it well over 100 times! Everyone should at least see it once, it's well worth it and holds some of the most memorable movie images of all time!",10,1,1,30 April 2000
