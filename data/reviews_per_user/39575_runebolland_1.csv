Your Name.," A beautiful and ambitious movie with small with a somewhat confused ending
","This movie did most things right. The art is absolutely beautiful, many times during the movie I was taken aback at how good it looks. the characters' are great. the friends of the main characters are very funny and likable, i wish we would have gotten more time with them. when it comes to the unbelievable premise, the characters reactions mostly stay grounded.a problem with the premise is that there are some small holes here and there. we are also asked to just go with things sometimes, even though there isn't any explanation or logic to it, such as when they forget each others names.*Spoiler Alert*there is one unfortunate big problem with the movie. what seems to be the goal of the movie is for the two main characters to find each other and get together. in one scene the main guy writes 'i love you' on her wrist, but the problem is that they have no chemistry. at no point earlier did I feel that they were in any way romantically interested in each other. this is a big problem because that is the goal. saving the people in the city an impressive act in itself, but it's not enough to make a satisfying ending. aside from this flaw, everything else is excusable. Irma give it an 8 out of 10",7,2,4,2 May 2017
