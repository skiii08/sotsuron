The Blair Witch Project," It Sucked.
","This movie will not scare anyone with a dozen brain cells.  Here we were, all expecting a fantastic horror/suspense flick, and all we saw were a bunch of idiots who get lost camping in the woods.  No matter how lost they were, they didn't stop filming, and even made a in-joke about it.  I've been more scared walking home in the dark, and I live in New York City.  Worst $8 I ever spent, even after seeing 'Leonard, Part 6'.",1,1,3,22 October 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," I can't say what this movie is to me...
","The best movie I've seen in ages!  Rips off Star Wars, Les Miserables, Rocky Horror, Pokemon, you name it! But the best part is the burning of Alanis Morrisette's CD! Death to Canada!",10,0,0,1 July 1999
Men in Black II," Too Short!
","That's my main complaint about it.  This movie could have easily used an additional 10-15 minutes.  Don't ask me what they should have done with the time, but it runs less than 90 minutes, and in a movie that is supposed to be a major summer blockbuster, that's just unsatisfying.",8,0,0,3 July 2002
