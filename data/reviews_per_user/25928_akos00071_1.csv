Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Sick, racist, disgusting and boring
","Sick, and racist. Everyone understands that the actor is a Jew, but that doesn't excuse racism anymore. Seeing an actual amputee in a poor Romanian Gypsy village with a gay rubber fist taped to his forearm - has exactly the same humor, as making a joke of the starving people of Nigeria.What we see in this film is that Cohen shows how much he hates Eastern Europeans, including Polish people, Romanians, Gypsies, and how much he hates Southern people, republicans, and Christianity, and virtually all American people. Only two positive characters exist in the film: the two orthodox Jews in the bread&breakfast scene. Cohen defended Borat as being a satire of how ignorant Americans are of other countries and their cultures, and even don't know where Kazakhstan is. I think this film is only shows how that he is very ignorant for all other cultures, including the American culture.What we see in this film, is the orthodox Jewish hatred, and Jewish racism. He thinks that he is superior, and while he hates every nation, he wants to condemn others, who don't like him. Furthermore he cannot demonstrate, or prove anything that he wants. In the gun shop for example it is just Cohen, who speaks loudly about killing the Jews, while the salesman doesn't say anything. Who were so daring to comment anything when a madman is shouting in the gun shop, about killing somebody in the presence of some cameras? The hatred is in Cohen's mind.",1,286,578,8 June 2007
