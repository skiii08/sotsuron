3:10 to Yuma," 'May Jehovah judge between you and me.' ~ 1 Samuel 24:12
","From a Christian viewpoint, Crowe & Bale do not offer any Faith-based acting values, or three-dimensional spiritual character portrayals. Crowe hasn't performed in a half-decent role, reflecting conflicting moral values since 'LA Confidential.' 'Gladiator' was a pseudo-moral conflict from the very beginning scene. As to Bale, his recent arrest for domestic abuse against his mother and sister, and his on-set rant against a Lighting Grip on 'Terminator: Salvation' speak volumes about how misguided he is not just as a professional actor, but as a human being (God-fearing or not). In my humble opinion, Crowe and Bales are H'wood stars whose acting choices are driven by very bankable massive egos, self-idolatry & the mortal temptation to serve fame. They've cut their deals w/ the Devil and it reflects in their disappointing acting choices. I pray they repent, accept Jesus, and choose roles that seek rewards not handed out by the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences.That aside, this is a passable remake. The screenplay writing, location selections, production design, supporting roles, and direction work. It's just that Crowe's 'I'm playing yet-another-variation of my everyone's-seen-it, bad-tempered, tantrum-throwing self' (thank God this film didn't have a scene in a hotel w/ his character wanting to place an overseas telephone call), and Bale's 'I'm due on the Batman set soon blank stares' ruin the entire effort put forth by the film's commendable production team. It's two hours hours of watching vain egos at combat with one another. There's no performances from either Crowe or Bale. The ending shot of the train with the landscape beyond it is visual magic and the director of photography deserves favorable mention.",Null,1,7,27 January 2008
Spartacus," They don't make Epics, like they used to.
","This is a very good epic produced and acted by a H'wood legend (Douglas). It starts off strong and just continues on that wave-length right through the conclusion when the lead is crucified. The performances that support this epic are all-around excellent. One possible quibble is that Curtis' character could have been built up somewhat so that in the last combat scene there is a stronger current of tension between Antoninus and the slave-king Spartacus. Strode is superb in his smaller role, as are Ireland and Gavin. I was born a decade after this film played in theaters, but it's a film that deserves a definite theatrical viewing. The scene that shows Spartacus leading the salves is expertly inter-cut w/ the Olivier character speaking to Romans. The battle scene is a HUNDRED TIMES better than all the CG-effects used in the over-promoted turkey 'Troy.' They just don't make Epics, like they used to.",Null,1,3,18 August 2006
Star Trek," What works what doesn't.
","This re-boot of the visionary franchise is a worthy movie-going experience. Many elements are above-average: the production design, the sets, the special effects, the musical score, the direction, the new fleet uniforms, most of the writing, and the casting. Well, almost all of the casting choices. There is the one exception that ruins it for me. I'm certain the actor is very talented and disciplined at his craft. It's just that every time the actor playing Leonard 'Bones' McCoy comes on screen the film takes a left turn as if his scenes are skits from Saturday Night Live. His performance of McCoy is a parody at best and if it's meant to honor DeForest Kelley well it misfired.",Null,1,7,24 May 2009
Memento," Short-term memory loss can be a
","A lot of IMDb reviewers hate this film and a lot more love it. I'm in the objective middle. It's a well written screenplay w/ wonderful performances. The story is straight-forward: the Leonard character killed his wife by injecting her repeatedly w/ Insulin. There never was an intruder who killed her. He does not suffer from short-term memory loss and is acting. When he kills the Teddy character he is bringing closure to his murderous spree (Dodd, Jimmy Grant). This is a solid film and worth watching much like 'The Crying Game' in its story structure. Kudos to Nolan and the actors  even if Carrie Anne is annoying!",Null,1,3,1 April 2007
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," 'It's a metaphor for crap' spoken by Aldous Snow...
","the character dating Sarah Marshall after she's dumped Peter (Jason Segel) when he describes her latest movie-within-the-movie about a murderous cell phone attacking pubescent women. The description also describes sitting through this film which is being hailed as the first male romantic comedy. It's a step in unchartered terrain, sure enough when it comes to the clichés that abound in this dreadful film: minorities are delegated to working behind the bar tending or being your waiter at the morning buffet service or to getting humped by the lead in an improbable scene early on. Improbable is the main ingredient in this dud. Peter gets dumped AND winds up in Hawaii at the same expensive resort as Sarah Marshall (the dumper), AND he stays in a $6000/a night suite FOR FREE! I-M-P-R-O-B-A-B-L-E!There's more... the front desk girl falls in love w/ our Peter and is able to walk away from her job to go on IMPROBABLE hikes and what-not just because the script is written that way. This film is an example of how the industry has become less about 'talent' and all about who you know... in this case Segel knows Aptow and hence... a dreadful film. It took an hour and a half for a genuine scene to come on the screen. When Sarah explains to Peter why she dumped him it really rang true, but then we're back to more of the same dreck from the first hour and a half. If you go see this go for the performance of the actor playing Aldous Snow who is brilliant in every scene... playing chess on the beach or having wine spilled on his dinner shirt... funny, but that's it.",Null,16,35,25 April 2008
Shutter Island," 'Why are you all wet?'
","For a pseudo-noir film where 'God' is mentioned in passing half a dozen times, Shutter Island has the same feel as a vintage Twilight Zone episode. The ones introduced by creator Rod Serling. There's a twist ending coming, for sure, but where-as the black and white series delivered some well-written, unexpected surprise endings, on Shutter Island blatant hints deter from any plausible surprise twists coming. Michelle Williams does nice work in her haunting role, but the truth about her character's demise lands like a thud when it's revealed. Jackie Earle Haley delivers crackling tension in his cameo, but that's the problem. It's just a cameo, and his character is leagues more interesting than the rest of the ensemble. Scorsese handles the direction well, but this is not like 'Cape Fear' at all! There is no Max Cady running loose. The musical score evokes feeling, but the story itself lacks any component of Faith or discussion of 'God.' Such a shame for a film that searches for truths to the protagonist's dilemma, a la 'Identity' with John Cusack, and ends unsure of what 'truth' is.",Null,4,9,20 February 2010
Cast Away," Cast this snoozer dreck away!
","From the elitist, we-make-each-other-look-fabulous Hank/Zemekis team that filmed the unappealing, lily-white, snoozer dreck 'Forest Gump' comes an equally unworthy lump of coal, two-hour advertisement for FEDEX and Wilson about.... nothing! Zemekis couldn't film a dramatic scene IF his served-on-a-gold-platter H'wood career depended on it. After four years of being cast away, Hanks finally is rescued, but WAIT the film cuts to 'Four Weeks Later.' The dramatic & potentially explosive pay-off possible in ending the four-year isolation of a man on a deserted island isn't even explored. Hanks went along with this?Pacino or DeNiro or even lily-white Hurt would demand the writer write the scene and that the director explore the dramatic layers evident in being rescued and saved from the very verge of death. UN-BELIEVABLE! Then in the very last scene, set in the middle of no-where Hanks encounters a stunning cowgirl (who gives new meaning to the word 'flirt') just after he's delivered a four-year old package to the stunning country home of the recipient. I could go on, but you get it.... this film is all about lily-white people leading lily-white lives where nary the speck of dramatic realism ever enters the picture.",Null,4,20,4 April 2008
Dreamgirls," The film could have been better edited and written.
","As a white, str8 male I enjoyed this story. It's not my favorite genre and the last musical I saw was 'Chicago' but this is by the same director and he has pedigree. However, maybe Mr. Condon should have toned down his ego and worked w/ a collaborator on the story. Too many of the characters are one dimensional and the story skips. As a result the Murphy character is not fully developed considering all the praise Eddie's getting for what is a very limited performance.What does work (and there should have been more scenes like this) are the two sequences where the characters sing and argue with each other. I'm referring to the 'Family' and 'And I'm Telling You' set pieces. The film really comes alive during these two scenes and there needed to be much more of that through out the entire movie. There wasn't.BTW: The 'Reunion' happy ending got the audience in the theater I was to really give it a loud applause.",Null,0,3,1 January 2007
Quantum of Solace," BRILLIANT Quantum of Solace.
","The so-called critic's chorus of middle-aged, testosterone-deficient, nattering nabobs of negativism (i.e.- Boston Globe's Wesley Morris, Chicago Sun-Times' Roger Ebert, filmcritic.com's Bill Gibron, Los Angeles Times' Kenneth Turan, New York Times' A.O. Scott, et al) have collectively missed the exhilarating ride Quantum delivers!!! They whine about the good old days when Connery played 007. It's a new millennium guys!!! Come out of the trenches!!! If Quantum had been a carbon copy of Casino Royale then these nattering nabobs would complain it wasn't more like what director Forster delivers: a edge of your seat, action-packed, plausible espionage drama of betrayal, retribution, and justice!!! See Quantum for yourselves and enjoy the ride. I did and I just may go back :) !!!P.S. The opening title sequence and song are NOT a disappointment. My one very minor quibble is the scene w/ Ms. Fields paying homage to Goldfinger could have been more of a revelation or surprise to the audience.",Null,8,16,14 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," No Awards for Tedious Film.
","1st, the Coen brother do not care about the ticket-buying, movie-going public. Their reality concerns the elite film awards circuit & those Coen brothers-worshiping critics who applaud at the very thought of Ethan or Joel wiping their ... you get it. This film reminds me of an 'I Love Lucy' episode wherein she is selected (much to Ricky, Ethel & Fred's dismay) to be featured in a book about first-time authors ... heading the chapter, 'Don't let this happen to you.' Why do I make this harsh comparison? Because this movie sets-up a main protagonist much like Hitchcock's stellar 'Psycho' whom audiences will identify w/ from the git go ... only Alfred directed his film superbly manipulating us up to the shocking shower scene. In this movie, ... the Josh Brolin character equates to the Janet Leigh character in 'Psycho' except the faithful audience is inexplicably robbed, by the evil Coen brothers (who couldn't manipulate mayo out of an empty jar if their ham sandwich depended on it), of a comparable scene w/ which to mourn the shocking loss of Mr. Brolin. It's as if the screenwriter hadn't a clue how to write such a scene so why bother! 'No Country for Old Men' should be included in every graduate film school program's textbook heading the chapter 'Don't let this movie happen to you.'",Null,24,37,27 January 2008
Mamma Mia!," Mamma Mia! is Outstanding.
","A year and a half I wrote a scathing review of 'The Devil Wears Parada' where I stated 'Because H'wood sycophants will laud Meryl-Frankenstein for wiping her ass and blowing her nose! The more H'wood lauds (and awards) Meryl-Dracula the more she herself believes she is God-Almighty resurrected in the body of Meryl-Godzilla. Truly sad. Meryl-from the Black Lagoon once showed talent in her film choices (Ironweed, Manhattan, The Deer Hunter), as of the last two decades she continually surfs on her 'name recognition' and not much in the 'talent' department. H'wood is prone to give flak to Faye Dunaway and the like for becoming caricatures of past film roles, but study Meryl-Cruella de Ville's role choices and she wins hands down the first place award (her favorite 'word') for the poster-child opening of rapidly fading, talent-less actresses who plays a variation of 'monster' and nothing else.'I now humbly beg forgiveness to Ms. Streep and her fans. She is a delight and luminescent as Donna in ' Mamma Mia!' The entire film excels in being a good modern musical. Thank you for the music and the memories...",Null,1,3,21 July 2008
World Trade Center," Powerful drama.
","I don't rush to see Oliver Stone films, but this is a masterpiece. This is a well-directed, well-acted, well-set designed, well-scored, etc, motion picture. Every production element comes together and the first fifteen to twenty minutes are nerve wracking! You know what's about to happen, but yet dread knowing! There is excellent and powerful drama at work here, a must-see! This exceptional film is the anti-'9/11 Farenheit'. Stone should be Oscar-nominated, as well as, the actors, but for Gyllenhaal who just isn't believable ... but you overlook her performance because Bello and the rest of the cast excel. America is a place in everyone's heart, and that the same director of 'JFK' and the bombastic 'Alexander' directed this work is a testament to his talent.",Null,2,10,14 August 2006
The Dark Knight," 'It's not sealed'
","Is a throw-away line spoken mid-way by Rachel Dawes to Alfred regarding the envelope containing her 'Dear John' letter to Master Wayne. More importantly, it forebodes the following sequence when the Joker is arrested and jailed in a fortress that's 'not sealed.' I digress, while Heath Ledger is everything everyone and their mother has written about him this is really Aaron Eckhart's movie. His Harvey Dent is the center of the gathering storm... the object of the Joker & Batman's duel is for Dent's soul... and in turn that of Gotham City. Director Nolan sets up the end nicely for the follow-up film, but better over-all editing would have gotten us (the audience) there sooner. This film is too long. For it's genre (action/adventure) it's brilliant, those action sequences blow us away, but Nolan should have trimmed some story fat. I have two quibbles: what was that cameo w/ Scarecrow all about? Couldn't the Nolan brothers have written a scene to remove him from the film that involved the Joker? Also, as a minority Nolan relegates the few minorities to baddies (Det. Ramirez, the Asian accountant) to token cameos (the Mayor).",Null,0,2,23 July 2008
Inside Man," 'Don't take this personally, Miss White, but you can kiss my black ass. '
","I have never been a Spike Lee fan. EVER! He comes across as arrogant and w/ air of self-importance that isn't appealing, but this film of his won me over so much I went to see it in the theater TWICE and that rarely, if ever, happens now-a-days! The thing about this caper-film is it has ALL the right ingredients: direction, writing, acting, stunts, musical score and, of course, LOCATION. New York City is a character in this drama as much as Foster's character or Owen's character. NYC is the face of fear, corruption, temptation, deliverance, and average, everyday, working human beings (ie.- the black kid, the Mayor, the barber, the Hindu, the Jewish woman, etc.) all colliding into one another because of simple, unabated greed! I could go on ... but do yourself a favor and watch this film yourself.",Null,0,2,19 July 2006
The Happening," I WAS a Whalberg-hater.
","Have been from the days when we each trained separately at Gold's gym in H'wood and he was well-known at the time ('96) as Markie Mark. He then kept a pretentious, steroid-taking posse around him CONSTANTLY that served to his every self-absorbed whim and would unnecessarily block other gym members from using certain weight-lifting equipment if his Lord Mark was using it. Total prima-donna behavior, but I commend Mark Whalberg (the actor) for choosing this role in 'The Happening.' Anything is an improvement over his generic, bad-boy shtick in violent films like Four Brothers, Shooter, and The Departed. I commend Whalberg for choosing a role that requires professional acting skills evident in his performance. He's well-supported by Leguizamo and the rest of the cast (in my humble opinion.) That aside, I enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's film. Great premise and definite nerve-wracking early sequences set the tone for what's to come. I hadn't seen one of Shyamalan's films since he directed 'Signs' and I think he makes a worthy effort. I can quibble about the last five minutes. I prefer a downbeat ending like the scene in the field outside the desolate farm house which is eerie and the music is perfect. The last five minutes after that scene is an anti-climax.At the screening I attended, this geek nerd exited the theater and loudly announced within everyone's ear-shot that he would personally punch Shyamalan on the nose for writing such a disjointed screenplay. I think that kind of opinion is too harsh. 'The Happening' is NOT a brilliant horror film, but it certainly is atmospheric and nerve-wracking in several sequences.",Null,2,9,15 June 2008
Inception," Dream a little bigger darling.
","This splendidly visual film is not the 2nd coming nor will it best The Dark Knight at the box office. On positive notes, what this movie is is a splendidly-photographed, very well-scored, strongly production-designed/set decorated drama with straight-forward acting that improves... no, brings out no, lifts up the overlong screenplay. Ellen Page deserves a supporting Oscar nom. On negative notes, some critics complain of too much exposition and several implausible scenarios. Since 'Inception' is all a dream within a dream within the implausible scenarios become plausible because they're happening within dreams. My complaint is that there is way too much studio-mandated explosions, gunfire, and car chases. Nolan may never be able to make another 'Insomnia' or 'Memento' in his career. He's the official Warner Brothers, if not industry, stalwart director. The man with the Midas touch, and the cost/price of that money-making achievement is all the unnecessary studio-mandated explosions, gunfire, and car chases that bloat 'Inception.'One last note, 'Inception' employs a cliffhanger (possibly to ensure material for Warner Brothers sequel films) that lacks resolution creating an anticlimax to a story in which the audience has invested 2 hours and twenty minutes.",Null,4,8,17 July 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," The film stays clear of Hollywood mucking ...
","Will Smith's performance as striving single dad Chris Gardner doesn't panhandle for an Oscar in this quietly agonized drama of reaching and missing and reaching and missing again. This Reagan '80s drama takes place in the clearly marked dividing line between that romanticized American dream of 'making it' and its realistic nightmare shadow. It's a fine film, with a portrait of fatherhood that is driven and real. The setting is San Francisco and it's based on a true story. Smith plays a man who once was a whip-smart kid but Chris never realized his potential having sunk his savings into a line of medical scanners that aren't selling. Chris is fraying at the seams.His wife, Linda (the very hot Thandie Newton looking worn to the bone and in some scenes clearly channeling her break-out role in 1998's 'Beloved' by repeating the same facial twitches and creepy neck movements associated with that title character) doesn't handle stress very well when Chris impulsively decides he'd rather be a stockbroker in a six-month internship at Dean Witter with no pay! Linda leaves with their child, but it's clear that Chris is the villain who instills misogynist fear in her to leave the boy with him even when Chris is jailed overnight for unpaid parking tickets! However, Chris is a charmer, and he never stops running -- to do so would be to admit defeat to his son -- but Smith nevertheless conveys the gradual erosion of a man's self-worth. Smith's got it easy since he's playing opposite his son (Jaden certainly looks comfortable hanging with his dad), but the understated beauty of the performance lies in how little attention Chris actually gives the kid. He's too busy worrying about Christopher to be with him.The director Gabriele Muccino is the writer-director of the 2001 Italian art - house hit 'The Last Kiss,' from which this year's substandard Zach Braff dreck-of-a-movie was extracted. There's a European sensibility to this movie: behavior here is observed rather than underlined and where another director might overplay the racial divide between Chris and his WASPy bosses at Dean Witter, Muccino and screenwriter Steven Conrad ('The Weather Man') let it go.'The Pursuit of Happiness' is a San Francisco movie with a specific sense of place and vibe from the daily homeless lines waiting for a nightly warm room Â… to the hush of a wealthy suburb on a weekend afternoon before a 49ers game. The film stays clear of Hollywood mucking -- a reminder of how close a person can dance to the pit and fall in, only to find out how heartbreakingly difficult it can be to clamber out. Smith's portrait of resilience and Muccino's clarity of heart are above par. The film title comes from a misspelled schoolhouse mural: If America is about the promise of bettering oneself, why does it have to be so freaking hard?",Null,0,0,27 January 2007
