Walk the Line," Art impersonates Life?
","Wow! What a ride! This is the first 'over two hours' movie I've seen that left me wanting more. The most telling thing about this movie for me was that I was fortunate enough to see Johnny Cssh and June at the Merrit Mountain Music Festival some years ago. I remember thinking I really wasn't that big a fan and did I really want to see him? Boy, was I glad I went! When he came out said that famous intro, 'hello. I'm Johnny Cash', well, the crowd went nuts and I got chills up my spine. When Phoenix said the line, I got the same chills. Talk about a 'bang on' performance.And Reece, well, one rarely falls in love with a character on screen, but she had me from the start. She had it all - the looks, the humor, the feisty girl, and the singing - wow! They brought a fresh new joy to all of the music and I was left wanting more. As a former musician, for me the director caught the excitement of 'making it' to a tee. When the movie ended, somewhat abruptly, I was left wishing there was another hour of seeing these two great, truly talented performers, keep singing and wowing me. I can't wait to buy it and play it over and over.",9,1,2,6 December 2005
