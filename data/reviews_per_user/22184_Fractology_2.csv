Skyfall," Good storyline, makes Bond a more realistic character
","Without getting into spoiler details here, I liked the detour that the producers chose to take from the typical Bond storyline. The movie is focused on Bond and his relationship with M as well as M's past. If you are a Bond fan this is a must-see movie that fills-in a few gaps in Bond's history and a fine celebration of the 50th anniversary of the franchise. Positioning Bond as a human being who is aging and has limits was a fine idea given we that we are celebrating half a century of movies. I also liked the increased use of humor - it was just right, not over-done. Several movie goers clapped at the end of the movie and at first I thought 'what is wrong with these people, it is not a Broadway show...' but eventually I clapped a few times myself. I recommend it.",7,6,16,10 November 2012
Spectre," Oouch - a disappointment
","I went to see this movie with high hopes, but left disappointed. The script was bad! That is the bottom line. Some of the acting makes it better, but at the core the script is just bad, confusing, unrealistic, cheesy. The length is probably too long, which does not help. The bond woman in this film is a so-so actress. She was a casting mistake, IMO. The plane scene chasing the bad guys - for example - where did he get the plane from? How believable is that (it is not)? That whole sequence lost me. I was hoping they would return to something closer to Casino Royale. What is wrong with making Bond more realistic? It worked great in Casino! Craig can do much better than this - too bad it looks like he is not planning to come back - he is probably the best Bond we have had.",5,8,18,7 November 2015
