The Blair Witch Project," A horror film without the horror?
","Quite a few people have already expressed their opinions about this film that I don't want to repeat. Let's not fool ourselves, by thinking that this is the best horror film since the 'Exorcist'. The whole film is based on the premise that it is supposed to be real. By taking this first step in your imagination, then you can begin to appreciate it. Most of the horror comes from our own imagination, hardly anything is spoon fed (the slasher movies comes to mind which are so graphic in detail, it leaves little to the imagination). You'll have to put the old grey matter in to first gear to try and step into the character's shoes. The film, if nothing else, is realistic. We see the three characters spiralling deeper and deeper into breakdown and insanity. Their ability to think logically is turned upside down as they get more and more lost in the woods. Strange sounds at night, wierd symbolic objects in the morning doesn't help their sanity much either. The ending is abrupt, and an anti-climax for sure. But the horror of the film doesn't start until you go home and think about the film. The more you go over the film in your head, the more horrifying it is, as if it was a true story.There will be people who won't like it, but the film is a docu-horror film which has succeeded where many before has failed.",7,0,1,15 October 1999
The Big Lebowski," Different, Strange and Cool Film
","This is a great film, lots of laughs, strange and interesting ideas, Jeff Bridges has done a turn around from previous roles. He is brilliant as 'The Dude'. John Goodman is great as the Vietnam veteran, even if it's unreal as people say (wake up people, the whole film is unreal...!) Steve Buscemi is his usual self... great characters, great fun!I really recommend this to anyone with a sense of humour.The soundtrack is brilliant as well! Go and see it!",10,1,2,28 September 1998
Unbreakable," An untypical superhero story
","Unbreakable is one of those great movies that tells the story of the 'real' superhero in our time. The real superhero is a human being with special gifts. How he copes with them is a very interesting premise.Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson was great in this. The atmosphere was perfect and overall a great story.The film marks the beginning of a superhero, the discovery of one's own power and how one's life is transformed because of it. In this case, Bruce's character have tried to suppressed his own true nature all his life in return for the love of a woman. He lives his life with some nagging feeling that there is something more. When he meet's 'Mr. Glass', he begin to realise that there is indeed more, much more waiting for him.Highly recommended for any comic book reader or those interested in real superheros.",9,0,0,28 January 2008
Fight Club," Gritty and Surreal
","One of the best films to come out this year. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt have been excellently cast in to this film, bringing the whole atmosphere and story to life. Some people say it is a violent film, and it is, but without condoning such violence. It can be graphic at times yet this is not what makes the film ticks. It is a combination of many things, from the characters, the dark humour and the main story of the film.Shame that in Hong Kong, the marketing for the film wasn't as big as it should be. Another one lost to the shallow culture of Hong Kong. Great shame indeed.",10,3,7,2 December 1999
The 13th Warrior," Brutal, Bloody and Forgettable
","I loved the scenery, the costumes, liked some of the characters. The atmosphere generated was pretty scary but by the end of the film... you suddenly realise the story wasn't that great, the ending was pretty lame and the only thing people watched this film was because of Antonio Banderas.If you have some time to spare, then watch this on the big screen. Don't think it would really work on video.Haven't read the book, but I'm sure it's much better than the film.",6,0,0,22 August 1999
American Psycho," Masterpiece in depravity and dark humour
","The film leads you into the world of excess, that leads the main character into an idea that he is in total control. This apparent inability to distinguish between reality and fantasy leads the viewer into the darker side of Patrick Bateman. A film that leaves things open ended is not always bad, as it makes the viewer question the film. Those who says the film is poor because of this, doesn't understand these types of films. Although it would be nice to spoon feed all the answers, it would leave very little to the imagination.
The film makes a good crossover from the book and violence wise the book is much more severe. We do not see cannibilism and any of the wierd sexual acts that Patrick Bateman performs in the book. It is all very gratuitous and in excess... The film is slick, Christian Bale is spot-on as the psycho, with the annoying monotone accent. A first rate film that is fresh and different.",10,0,1,5 November 2000
American Beauty," The downfall of modern American society
","What does this say about American culture? This dark, humorous depiction of a suburban family shows us how a family eventually ends up in the pits of supposed unhappiness, and how they eventually manage to crawl back out with a taste of what made them happy in the first place. An excellent film, excellent script and excellent portrayals of the characters by Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch...
Highly recommended.",10,0,0,7 March 2000
Batman Begins," The Way It should have been
","This is how the modern Batman film should have been directed. It is dark, dirty and dangerous. This is the real Dark Knight. Having read the comics and coming to admire the story 'The Dark Knight Returns', the Batman is not some campy show in the 70s, nor was it the film directed by Tim Burton. Okay. Tim Burton approached somewhat the style of the Dark Knight, but it was still not as dark as it could be.Christian Bale is amazing in this, he has the right physique and he has the fighting skills on film (see Equilibrium). The supporting actors of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy are perfect.Gotham City is dark and a scary place, just ripe for a winged crusader to save it from the criminals lurking around.The story itself is quite 'meaty' and setups the story quite nicely. It also ends by leading the audience to a possible sequel. If the sequel can outdo this excellent first attempt, then I am already salivating.",10,1,1,21 June 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Magnificently Engaging and Beautiful Film
","Wonderful story, deep characters, amazing scenery! This is a must see for all those interested in Chinese martial myths. The common thread that runs through this film is that we are all imprisoned in one way or another and the meaning of freedom depends upon the person's perspective.The fighting sequences are excellent, and brings back to my memory all those old Hong Kong martial art serials. I particularly loved the bit on the roof top where Michelle Yeoh chases the thief across old Beijing city. Totally amazing. I found this film very moving and this will become a classic in time to come. Ang Lee has done a superb job and I eagerly await his next project. In this film, Ang Lee has the right combination of action, drama and humour.
Go and see it on the big screen. You will not be disappointed.",10,0,0,18 January 2001
The Game," A roller coaster of a ride with a soft landing
","I can't believe that some people could actually compare the film 'Sliver' to this great film. There are no comparison, The Game is an excellent film, with good characters. Michael Douglas was great in this, I really felt what he felt. I could understand his fear. The last scene on top of the building is one of the best I've seen. The darkness and Gothic styles are used to great effect.Of course, there are minor details that cross the reality line, but hey, it's entertaining nevertheless. If you keep putting your intellect into every film you see, then you might as well watch Discovery Channel.This is a great piece of escapism, with an unusual ending. I highly recommend this film, for those who are looking for something different...",10,0,1,6 June 1999
Event Horizon," Not the best horror film in the world, but ...
","The film's idea was pretty good, but halfway through I thought it was stealing some ideas from Hellraiser.The acting was average, but Sam Neill was pretty good. He must have been into his horror side, after Omen, Dead Calm, and In the mouth of madness,They should have explored further into the characters such as Sam Neill's, and also about the idea of hell. It would have been very interesting, and even scarier.The quick flashes of the past crew was a very good and give me chills.Overall, it's not a bad film, yet it should have taken some of the ideas further.",Null,0,0,19 May 1999
Mission: Impossible II," A letdown after the hype
","Let me say, the trailer was good. Wetted my appetite for the real deal...Sorry to say that the film was cliche, the fight scenes could have been improved (should have hired Woo Ping Yuen as the martial arts director), the editing was not sharp enough to backup the action. Some of the scenes like on the bike was so unrealistic that the Hong Kong audience found it unrealistic (after being brought up on unrealistic martial arts film in HK, I would have thought we could have accepted this)...The MI team is supposed to be a hi-tech team with lots of gadgetry like in MI part 1, but in MI2, we don't see much of this.This is another run of the mill action film. John Woo's direction was disappointing, laboured over some of his trademarks such as the slow motion cam, plus the doves. The damn dove and the damn pigeons!There are some good new tricks (like shooting backwards on the bike by looking at the rear view mirror), but the emphasis was not there. It didn't look as cool as it should have. I can't put my finger on the thing that ruined the film... but it definitely could have been much much better.
Gladiator is a better bet for the summer's action...",Null,0,0,28 June 2000
National Treasure," Run of the Mill
","I watched this movie thinking it would be something special. This is what happens when you get suckered into the marketing posters and trailers.The premise started out well, but in the end, it's just another run-of-the-mill type adventure. Nicholas Cage is fine in this but his action sequences has been stepped down somewhat compare to what he had done previously.The story revolves around hidden treasure laid down by the Templars and then hidden by the Freemasons. I was thinking that maybe the treasure was symbolic, but unfortunately, it's just your run of the mill gold, priceless documents, statues etc. Okay. There is a lot of it. But still...Maybe if they had some kind of international flavour to this, then it might have compared to the likes of Indiana Jones. But this was sadly not the case.It's okay to while the time away, if you have some spare. Otherwise, it's not really worth the effort.",6,0,1,6 July 2005
Eyes Wide Shut," Good Film... Bad Film?
","People have already previously commented on this film and some of the storyline, so there's no point in me doing that all over again.
Suffice to say, it's not a 'porno flick', but nevertheless a feast for the eyes and also something that makes you think. A good example, is when Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are smoking pot and talking about their night at a friend's party. Nicole Kidman asks one of those questions that every man fears, since instinctively, you know that whatever you say is going to be the wrong answer. :)There is nudity and some great bodies to look at if that is what you are looking for. But in addition, it also makes you think, can you really make sex impersonal? Can you have sex with a perfect stranger and not even know what they feel, what they look like? The music score is excellent and adds to a very atmospheric film. A good example of this, is when the Tom Cruise character goes to the masked party and eventually gets demasked. Some people will come out of it and say it's a film that disappoints as Kubrik builds up a film to be a thriller then lets the air out of the balloon. Any other director would have made a Hollywood film out of it. I could just imagine the predictable ending that would have ruined the film. Upon reflection, I found the film thought provoking and an enjoyable 3 hours... (The film shown in Hong Kong was the unedited version, but I am not sure what things were cut out in the other releases).",Null,0,0,6 October 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," One of the best films I've seen this year
","This film is side splittingly funny, violent without being graphic, and clever in its plot and the various twists. Basically, it's about four conmen trying to cover their asses, with successes and failures. There are plenty of interesting characters in the film with superb one-liners, that most non-British people will probably miss out on. It's a shame that there was only limited release in Hong Kong, (one cinema!) because this film should have had a higher profile. It's not a Hollywood film with big budgets and expensive special effects, so it's not surprising.
Don't think it's another Pulp Fiction, because it's not. I like Pulp Fiction, but this is much better! Go and see it.",10,0,0,11 October 1999
The Sixth Sense," Atmospheric and a single twist
","Looking at this film in an objective manner, there is really nothing in it that would class it as a very good film. Bruce Willis is still the same 'smirking' Bruce Willis, whatever comes out of his mouth. All it has to offer are some atmospheric and sometimes disturbing images with a final twist to the story.But the film is entertaining and quite disturbing. Maybe I have too much of an imagination for my own good. I came out of the cinema thinking that I should see it again from the perspective of knowing the whole story. This might have been interesting, but it may have amplified the glaring holes in the film. Nevertheless, it made me think about the film and try to understand the character that Willis played. This could have been an even better film with emphasis on the relationship between the characters, especially Willis' character and his wife. If you have a spare afternoon, go see it but don't expect too much.",9,0,0,10 October 1999
