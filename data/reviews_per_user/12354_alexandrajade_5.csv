Whip It," All hail Ellen Page
","In many respects, 'Whip It' is not that great a movie. It's horribly predictable, both in plot and pacing. The supporting characters (Bliss' parents, best friend, rival pageant queen, some of the other roller girls, the love interest) are drawn staunchly from stock. There's some pretty bad acting, too (Juliette Lewis is downright cringeworthy, and Drew Barrymore's funny but more than a little over the top).Really, it all comes down to whether we, the audience, care about Ellen Page's character Bliss. And the tiny Canadian shines. It's meaningless and banal to directly compare one performance to another, but I'll say that this performance of Page's is as impressive and engaging as any in her career, and certainly made me an (even bigger) fan of hers. She succeeded in creating a character around whom the story really works well.There's other good points, to be sure. I enjoyed Kirsten Wiig as Maggie Mayhem. Andrew Wilson as the 'zen master' of roller derby and play-by-play man Jimmy Fallon were both an absolute stitch. But without Ellen Page, this movie probably falls flat on its face. And with her, it's a good, solid 7/10.",7,0,3,5 January 2011
Ali," Will Smith carries the show
","For a life story, this movie is both long and short. It doesn't span a very long time, only a few years, but is over 2 and a half hours in length. It gets really slow at times, especially when Smith and Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X just sit around talking about their next exploit. The cinematography in the boxing scenes is just nauseauting. It gave me a killer headache :-)But all in all, this isn't a bad movie. Will Smith certainly earned his Oscar nomination. He was marvelous as the bad-ass, do whatever-the-hell-I-wanna-do Cassius Clay. Jon Voight as Howard Cosell also provided for some excellent scenes, though I've heard better Cosell impressions.\Definitely worth renting if you've got $3 burning a hole in your pocket.",5,0,1,27 July 2002
Memento," Absolutely incredible
","This is probably the best movie I've ever seen. The screenplay, the acting, the story...amazing.POSSIBLE SPOILERS The basic idea of this movie is that Guy Pearce's character can't remember anything since an attack in which his wife was killed. We see two lines of action, one in color, one in black and white. The color one moves backward. What we see first is the end of the story. The other one moves forward. It is the beginning of the story. When they meet at the end of the film, black and white turns to color and everything makes sense.Part of the genius of doing the movie backwards is that we, the audience, don't know any more than Guy Pearce's character does, since what happened in the prior scene hasn't actually happened yet.The only criticism I can possibly think of this movie is that it's difficult to follow. But of course, it's supposed to be difficult to follow, and that's part of its greatness.Truly a MEMORABLE movie!10/10",10,0,2,28 December 2002
The Village," Absolutely horrible
","I'm a big Shyamalan fan. 'The Sixth Sense,' 'Unbreakable,' and 'Signs' are all fine films, provided you watch them exactly once. But this work is subpar at best and horrible at worst.For starters, 'those we do not speak of' were too much about words and too little about actual suspense in this film. They were referred to practically every minute and showed up, what, two times? This is not to say the village should have been under constant attack, but it made it seem as though there was no enemy. Children play, people get married, it's all very ho hum except for the town gathering and climactic scenes.Brody's portrayal of the mentally challenged character is passable. I do like how he is tied in to the main story thread at the end. Phoenix also is passable. His portrayal is fine, there's just not much there. It really feels like Night threw this script together quickly.But there are signs (pardon the pun) of what is to come all throughout this film. It makes the big 'twist ending' a colossal letdown. And to those who savor this movie for its 'artful exploration of the human mind' and whatever, that's fine for about 1% of the population. Frankly, I would like that AND some suspense, which Shyamalan has shown he can give us. He just didn't do it here.3/10 (I'm not gonna lie, it's because of Bryce Dallas Howard that this film even got 3 from me)",3,0,1,12 October 2004
The Fast and the Furious," What do car chases, lots of cursing and rap music add up to? A pretty weak film.
","I wasn't expecting much when I picked this one up at the video store, so maybe it's not as good as I think it is.The plot is Paul Walker, undercover cop, tries to infiltrate a street racing clique to get to a gang that is hijacking trucks. He is such a hoser! I'm sorry, he just sounds like a hoser! He has the voice of a hoser! (point made)He gains the trust of Vin Diesel's character, infiltrates the ring...and well, I didn't say there were spoilers so I won't give any. But the plot is tragically underdeveloped. You can see right through everything that everyone does. It's pretty clear that the police will make a mistake before they find out the real hijackers.Vin Diesel's performance and a surprising ending save this one from the absolute bottom of my list.4/10",4,0,1,28 December 2002
