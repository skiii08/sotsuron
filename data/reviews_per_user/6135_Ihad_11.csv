Kill Bill: Vol. 2," rampaging and roaring at 1 mph on the left lane
","After seeing both movies Vol. 1 and 2 I finally sat down to review what I saw. What did I see? An awesome, cleverly constructed, action packed movie full of suspense? In so many words: No.On seeing Vol. 2 the impression hardens that this really should have been one movie of approx. 100 minutes length. Then it could have been good, or not, who knows. It's just that you can't help but wonder why this has to be a separate movie. People expecting sword fight galore and chopped off limbs by the dozen will be sourly disappointed this time around. KB2 feels like it consists of 90% (cool) talk that isn't all that interesting. Sure, the bride clears a few things up about the wedding and her relation to Bill, but this is what we expected. And that is right where the crux lies. There is no suspension whatsoever. The bride will get her revenge and Bill will die. Surprise! Of course, it's not always necessary to have plot twists or elude the viewer, Titanic never made you guess twice either.In the words of Coleridge the 'suspension of disbelief' never set in. You may argue that this is no requirement for a good movie but I digress. I kept looking at the time index and wondering when this will be over because in spite of all its shortcomings KB2 has a great soundtrack, excellent camera work and tries its best to achieve the QT coolness factor.Cutting both films into one would have set the right pace for one hell of a QT movie and not two mediocre ones.5/10",5,4,7,5 August 2004
The Big Lebowski," when the dude is blathering about new things that have come to light you better listen
","Another Coen classic I dare say. Certainly one of the weirdest Coen films in my book. Jeff Bridges delivers a brilliant performance as 'The Dude' but not only he, also John Goodman as Walter is unbelievably good. There's not one character that feels miscast or 'out of place', not even the German nihilists. And then there is Jesus... When you think it can't get any weirder (unless you go see 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas') wait until Jesus starts to bowl. Now you may not like bowling but that's of no consequence because 'new things will come to light' when you keep watching, things like beverages of a certain kind, rugs, toes, scribbled notes, car stolen, car found, a baseball bat, money lost, the Eagles, thorough doctors, sex, not necessarily in that order.The dream sequences are yet another part of this movie which in itself would be totally cheesy and boring for anyone to watch, but this time around it's the dude and you fly along with him. No questions asked.
One cannot help but wonder though how the dude makes a living besides playing courier for ransom money? Maybe he acts as a jury for his landlord's dancing performances? Who knows? It's beside the point. The dude does what the dude does: Nothing, but that he does exceedingly well.8/10",8,1,3,6 August 2004
Lost in Translation," You get to see life as it is. A rare thing. Treasure it.
","If you saw the last Oscar show, you might have noticed that Bill Murray was utterly disappointed not getting an Oscar for his performance in LiT. I was too. He was brilliant.What makes this a good movie? it's just about two people feeling out of place in a foreign country, isn't it? It's the humanity, the tiredness, the resignation, the unspoken attraction, the fun and the feeling to belong, it is what is not on screen that makes this movie work. You have to connect to the 'still' of the movie in order to experience this. It is as if this movie tries to paint a still of life in a particular situation, capturing every facet of it in sometimes vibrant sometimes dull colors, depending on the facet itself.Nothing spectacular happens, except for Bill Murray exercising, no action, no Sf/x. You get to see life as it is. A rare thing. Treasure it.9/10",9,0,1,5 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," You need people of intelligence on this sort of mission... quest... thing!
","If you, like me, read Tolkien as a child and went to see FotR in the cinemas you most likely sat there with a huge grin on your face the moment you saw Gandalf arriving in Hobbiton.Throughout this movie, it all seems to fit in and you totally immerse yourself in a fantastic world you might have read about in your childhood and that is magic. This might not work for everyone but there are a lot of Tolkien fans out there and I am sure it worked and still works for them.The changes and additions (which provide ample opportunity for heated debates) aside, the movie has its own magic and is so well based on the books that there's nothing much to critizise on first view, of course if you do want to find something then you sure will and there certainly is always room for improvement.For me, it wasn't really an issue that e.g. Arwen's part was boosted/changed or Tom Bombadil was left out. Even Liv Tyler wasn't really an issue in FotR, although I found her to be the weakest link in the whole cast ensemble.If you like Tolkien et. al. then you will find that this movie is made with so much care and detail that you will hardly notice the 3 hours and will be eager to see even more. On the other hand if you are not into fairy tales, adventure and 'quest... thing' then you might want to stay clear of this one because this is an epic.Theatrical Release 8/10 :: Expanded DVD Ed. 9/10 (for fans only)Add.: One thing (among others) the Expanded Version succeeds in is showing Galadriel in a much happier light, which was direly missed in the theatrical version.",8,0,1,11 January 2003
Van Helsing," This movie smells like a wet dog
","I rarely rate movies as low as 1 but Van Helsing while theoretically deserving a 4 for craftsmanship in cutting, costumes and sf/x, I cannot rate it higher than 1 due to its utmost abhorrent script - plot? what plot? - performance and feeble attempts to be funny. What happened? I did enjoy 'The Mummy' tremendously, I even liked the 'Mummy Returns' but this is an outrage and Kate Beckinsale - already proven to be worst actress of the year in 'Underworld' - seems to have a fable for showing off her body instead of her acting talents, which might prove difficult as these are seemingly nonexistent.There are indeed many viewers who enjoyed this shallow pop corn flick and it's their good right to do so, but as fan of the genre I could merely wince in my chair seeing how such a potential character as Van Helsing goes to waste in yet another instalment of 'all show and no brains'.Yet it began really promising with the hunt for Mr. Hyde (very nice CGI there) but sadly these first 15 minutes are the only highlight of this movie and Richard Roxburgh seems to be only actor worth his grain of salt.Go see The Mummy again instead. 1/10.",1,3,6,6 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Less Pathos is more, less Arwen is more
","TTT picks up where FotR ends, naturally. The opening sequence of TTT is breathtaking, why a girl in the row behind me even cheered when Gandalf snatches Glamdring in mid air. You're in medias res and can't help but to immerse yourself in the world of Middle-Earth once again. The grin was back on my face, I liked it... yes you know what I am going to say... the 3 letter word: 'but' - but not all is well in the land of Tolkien this time around.The book has 3 main plot lines and so does the movie. A difficult and daunting task one the director has mastered well to a certain degree. I will not argue about character changes plot cuts, rearrangements or additions, since it is the right of the director to do what he or she feels is necessary in the light of dramaturgy.Again: but... the pacing does not feel right this time, esp. flashback scenes with Arwen slow the movie down to zero numerous times and are trying the viewers patience and good will, esp. since Liv Tyler fails to impress us with her interpretation of Arwen.But... it is not only Liv Tyler's scenes, the 'pathos' swings high throughout the movie, too high for my taste. King Theoden could have been depicted with greater care and detail and less 'pathetic'. Him crying with close-up is a little too much. Let him say his lines at his son's grave and 'cut' for pity sake.All in all it is still a well made movie and a worthy successor of FotR. Unfortunately, if you haven't seen the first part you won't get much out of the second one. If you have read the books then you will be upset about certain changes and additions or omissions (as you might have been with FotR). Try to ignore your first impulse and see it for what it is: An interpretation of Tolkien's masterpiece, an action loaded one with a lot of pathos and less character development, except for Gollum, who really saved the day this time around.Kudos to Andy Serkins. Never have I been so thrilled to watch a CGI character on screen and forget that it is CGI I am watching. Bravo. Of course all effects are top-notch (yes, the Ents are fantastic, too) and the musical score is darker and matches the movie's tone very well.Given the difficulty to film the 3 plotted 2nd part one might forgive the 'pathos' and flashback sequences, even the Faramir changes or the (pointless) 'Aragorn River scene' (etc.) but since the pacing is already extremely difficult to handle with 3 plots, it weighs even heavier to make such drastic pacing 'mistakes' or - let's say - rather 'decisions'. 3 points off for this one, Mr. PJ.7/10 Theatrical Release [maybe 9/10 for Extended Edition if we see more Faramir character development, if certain flashback scenes are cut/changed and if we get more screen time for Ents]",7,0,0,11 January 2003
Shrek 2," intermedial cat sized fairy tale fun ride
","Fears that Shrek2 is a 'So Shrek was a hit and we want to make more money' movie can be dissipated - at least to a certain degree. It has the touch and feel of a sequel - well of course! It is a sequel, but I would argue it is a worthy one. There's plenty of fun, plenty of references to all sorts of films and tales, there's a puss in boots and it talks besides other things. The plot doesn't really demand much of our attention but then again neither did Shrek. The CGI is shrekalicious and leaves little to be desired. It doesn't not want to be photo realistic so please do not expect any Gollum CGI stuff, besides the lighting and animations are fantastic. This is a comic book like fun fairy tale ride, fast paced - are we there yet - at times and chock full with good music.The voices of Mike and Eddie are complemented yet again by sexy Diaz and Antonio 'Puss' Banderas! Simply hilarious. Again, I recommend you go see the original, e.g. in comparison the German voices leave a lot to be desired.It doesn't bring anything 'new' it's 'just' more Shrek, but then again that's exactly what you should expect and exactly what you will get. What more do you want? Shrek3 I hear you coming...More Shrek Fun for the whole family! 8/10",6,0,0,9 August 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," roaring revenge lacking proper cut
","I held back my review of Kill Bill 1 and 2 until I saw both movies, esp. since originally it was one movie, which is confirmed by the credits in KB2. I do like Quentin's work, albeit in KB1 I found myself asking why? What is so intriguing, entertaining, pleasing, shocking, confusing about it? Well exactly that it is all of that but KB1 fails to deliver in that respect, it is technically brilliant and all students of film making will get the most out of it, but a movie is plot driven which in turn is carried by its characters and I really fail to see why this simply plot has to be stretched out over 2 movies. It is lengthy, oversaturated, chock full with abhorrent dialogue and Uma Thurman doesn't convince me in the least she can wield a samurai sword without cutting herself up.It seems Quentin has a big bonus due to his prior work (and rightly so) and when it comes to reviews of KB1 I cannot help but feel that he used it all up with KB1+2.So, when I left the theatre after seen KB1 I asked my fellow viewers what they thought. Everyone agreed that this movie is pointless. Literally, it has no point. We care not why when if killers kill themselves under whatever circumstances and we certainly care not just because it has coolness written all over it. It lacks the certain intelligent and witty touch his prior flicks possessed.Others I asked were enraged when I voiced my critique and pointed out that this is a masterpiece, a homage to all the trash movies and animes and to that art of film making per se. I grant you that. But why does this make it a good movie? Because? Well, that's just not good enough for me. And what about the soundtrack? You got me there; yes it is top notch in KB1 and 2.6/10",8,0,2,5 August 2004
The Descent," Forget 'The Cave' and take the descent into the dark. You will be scared. Promise.
","If you scare easily then you might not want to descend into that cave with those girls. It is pretty tense. Be warned. 'The Descent' is a classic horror shocker from British director Neil Marshall, featuring an all girls group and their love for extreme sports, aka 'No risk no fun'. It centers on two of the women, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) and Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza), in a caving expedition that goes all wrong, the rest is just - as in all horror flicks - extras and their fate is clear from the beginning.The movie starts slow and builds on the traumatizing car accident in which Sarah loses her husband Paul and daughter Jessica. One year later her five friends organize a caving expedition to help her get back to her old self. Sarah is still on heavy medication and has not overcome her loss. The six girls set out to explore a cave somewhere in the Appalachian mountains and that is where the movie unfolds its menacing claws and grabs you right at your throat and never lets go all through until the end.It's dark, it's intense and you feel like you squeeze through these tunnels yourself, getting stuck any moment with the rocks collapsing on top of you. If that weren't enough, you start seeing pale human like creatures that seem to live down there in that cave, predators. They hunt you. They eat you alive.There are plenty of gory scenes and there are plenty of scenes that make you wince and depending on how easy you scare there are plenty of scenes that make you jump. Watching this movie on a cold dark night together with your girlfriend, maybe with a little storm outside, rattling at the window shutters should provide you with the perfect thrill. Be warned, covering your eyes is not enough. The sound leaves little room for speculation and while some may think that a group of six women will result in helpless screaming and running I can assure you this is not the case. There is screaming a plenty but then again you would scream, too. Besides, Juno is one hell of a fighter and when she kills she does it with a ferociousness that is beyond comparison. She makes Rambo look like a school boy - let alone the fact that she simply looks hot - something I cannot attribute to Rambo.You can pretty much picture out the whole movie and it's not that hard to predict what will happen in that cave. It's pretty straightforward and its predictability is possibly the movie's greatest drawback. Still, it's one hell of a descent into your darkest fears, predictably so or not. Who will survive? Will anyone survive? You will need to watch until the end to find out. I do not want to spoil anything here but it does have a very fitting ending, at least that's what I think. Just one tip, watch out for 'Love each day'.The soundtrack just adds to aforementioned tension and ever present menace. The lighting and the different colors are very effective and create an overall atmosphere of impending doom. Again, you will get no rest once you descend into that cave. If you are not too scared you will also have fun spotting all the references to classics like 'Carrie' and 'The Time Machine'. Keep an eye out for those! As this is a British production you can expect the actors to speak in rather thick dialects at times, e.g. there's one Irish girl which might be hard to understand. It has not yet been released in the States at this time but is already out on DVD here in Europe and it's an 18+ release, too. You can buy the R2 release of 'The Descent' already. A must have for all horror fans.Forget 'The Cave' and take the descent into the dark. You will be scared. Promise.",7,2,5,14 November 2005
Shrek," intertextual piece of ogre sized fairy tale fun
","Granted, the CGI in Shrek is different from e.g. Ice Age, Monsters Inc. or Final Fantasy but that doesn't make it bad CGI, it's just different, Ice Age had super cool Water Surfaces, Monsters Inc. had super cool Fur effects and FF had the hair but Shrek has an Ogre and a talking Donkey and that's hard to beat! i.e. effects aren't all in fact in Shrek these are secondary. As the plot thickens - and there's little time wasted before it does - we get entangled in so much cross references to well known fairy tales and popular movies that it's pure fun to watch (even if you don't get all the intertextual references).The voice acting is simply hilarious and I urge anyone to go see the original version if possible. While localized versions surely have their own style and touch it will not be the same as with Eddie and Mike on the helm. Let's just say voices like these 'come in short supply'.If you expect CGI mayhem and a genuine ogre fairy tale you might well be disappointed but if you like a fast paced fun ride through fairy tale land and if you want to know more about the Muffin Man then this is for you and please watch out for unwanted physical contact from she dragons.Fun for the whole family. 8/10",8,2,4,9 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," One movie to rule them all
","ROTK is in so many words the best epic fantasy movie I have seen in my entire life, with Fellowship of the Ring as close second. I did not like TTT as much as the other 2 but still found it good enough to earn a solid 8 (TTT extended DVD gets a 9 esp. for the Faramir scenes). Now, ROTK...When I go watch movies I can get irritatingly picky when it comes to details and the general flow of the movie. That flow can be disturbed by just one word from a line of a character. The flow of ROTK was first disrupted for me when I heard Smeagol call Deagol 'My love' and secondly in the schizo-dialogue of Gollum/Smeagol this time as water-reflection - also a bad idea to copy yourself I thought instantly when I saw the scene, esp. since the schizo-dialogue scene in TTT was ultimately more powerful. Anyway, these are very small things one can easily forgive. However, I winced everytime Arwen was on screen and for me it was once again just confirmation that Liv Tyler is a total miscast and one can only be thankful that her screentime has been cut to the very minimum in ROTK. Esp. the schoolgirl giggling at the crowning ceremony made me moan. Oh well, I endured her. I am sure there are lots of people who think she was well cast (there's always one) but eventually even PJ must have realized what poo poo he got himself into by casting her (cut cut cut).Apart from weak Smeagol/Deagol dialogue and the Arwen scenes there is just one more significant criticism: 'Saruman' or lack of thereof. I read all about why and how it came to the cutting of those 7 minutes at the beginning of the movie. Now, having seen the movie I can to some extent understand why it is detrimental to (re)introduce a character for just 7 minutes, kill him off and then start with the actual topic of the movie. Still, since we are treated with an Isengard scene (palantir) it is highly unsettling NOT to have the voice duel scene in there and it is also highly unsatisfactory to blank cut from Isengard directly to the Halls of Rohan. How the hell did they get there so fast? Ok, they all rode on Shadowfax... But even this is forgiven, with the comforting assuredness of an Extended DVD Version offering all that is 'missing'.For a 'cinematic' version it 'failed' in that respect that it was too long. Some of the scene could be trimmed a little more and the movie could be a good 20 minutes shorter without any 'non fan' noticing any difference. Since PJ redefined the term 'cinematic release' I thought we would be treated with a specially cut short version this time. It was not so and I for one am glad for it. Professional Critics might differ and call it a failure with too many endings, but we not listening... we says go away and never come back! ;)In closing my 'review' I must speak of the 'epic' character of this picture. The 'epic' scenes are so powerful that they make you 'feel' the sheer power, the might, the desperation, fatality, sadness and beauty. They touch your soul, they move you in a way not many movies succeed to do, esp. not in this genre. The grace of Gandalf riding to the rescue of Faramir, the charging of the Rohirim into certain death, the kingly end of a father in the arms of his daughter... 'Eowyn'. So many moments that have you on the edge of your seat, make you gnaw your nails, make you feel exhausted, overrun and leave you totally empty, it is not the End of a Quest you simply happen to watch, it is *your* Quest, the quest of the audience as well and it too comes to an end this christmas... only until Nov 2004 when ROTK EE will enchant us once more.My recommendation: This movie is best seen twice to gain its full impact.9/10 DVD EE +1 = 10/10",9,0,0,23 December 2003
