Iron Man 3," Epic.
","Just epic. The action was AMAZING. The storyline was easy to follow, and great. Usually the effects are great and the storyline suffers, but not here. It was well balanced and just blew me away. I think my favorite part of how this was made was that it had multiple plots going on at once, and it really keeps you on your toes. Although it was long, (2+ hours) I was entertained the whole time. Also, you could really see character change through the entire storyline, plus there were NEW characters, I don't want to spoil it, but they're really great. The acting was fantastic. Great movie, one of my favorites. It's a must watch, I can almost guarantee you'll love it.",10,3,7,8 June 2013
