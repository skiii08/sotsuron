Ford v Ferrari," Christian Bale is a genius
",One of the best films of the year. A gripping story and a top top performance by Bale,8,0,1,30 November 2019
The Irishman," you'll want to watch it over & over again
","Absolutely brilliant.. pure art in every small detail.. in the world Scorsese creates.. in those moments of silence on DeNiro's face that say it all.. in Pacino's endless energy.. and in Pesci's remarkably quiet intensity.. the work of true geniuses.. It is long, but when it ends.. you'll probably want to rewind and watch it all over again.. Because although a story about real life gangsters.. at the heart of it is a story about life..
That's why it will be a timeless work of art.. a new classic and may be one last chance of seeing these guys all together",9,3,10,29 November 2019
The Irishman," It is what it is
","A new timeless classic that will live on forever. Top top acting. I read People moaning about the length of the movie, I could've gone on for another hour.
While It's a story about real gangsters, at the heart of it Is a story about life that will make you think long and hard.
No one creates this world so vividly like Scorsese does and he gives his actors the space to simply transform us to that world.
DeNiro's face will break your heart says in those moments of vulnerability. Pacino is a menace full of great energy and Joe Pesci''s subdued intensity was the best performance of them all",9,2,8,8 December 2019
