Mission: Impossible III," Wow! Never an ADHD moment. I'm cured!
","Ah! The opening sequence of this movie rocked! Going to this movie was a last minute decision while driving past the theatre. A drive through the parking lot, and a Nah. Followed by another drive into the parking lot to park. What the heck. This place only charges $6, even though I heard it sucks.No, it doesn't suck. I haven't seen any of the previous Mission Impossible movies in this series. You don't have to. I do recall the theme of the TV show being cheezy. In the 'Get Smart' era. Maybe.When the lead character receives his assigment after stopping for ice, I was hooked. Yeah! I'm a wanna-be geek, and I knew what they were doing.The remainder of the movie? Action/suspense that is: non-stop, eye opening, jaw slacking, glazed eye, mesmerizing... Cool. The plot was unpredictable, and full of: twists, turns, cranks and spins. Then it all tied together. Save for one scene: what happened to some agents returning to HQ? It was a pretty unusual scene to leave as is.Billy Crudup & Phillip Seymour Hoffman from 'Almost Famous,' re-join as powerhouse actors in this movie. As typical of this genre, there are good guys vs the 'bad guys.' Hoffman WAS the bad guy. Real bad, hope I never see that kinda bad, bad. I spent a good portion of the movie wondering who the biologist was. There was a really cheezy line that he had to deliver. 'Benjy' was an all-knowing philosophical twit. He compared bad guys to bad entities. I wanted to scream: Yeahh! That's what other people call TERRORISM, ya dork! That's the only part that irked me. But who is that actor? I've IMDb'd it, & it was Simon Pegg - star of Shaun Of The Dead. Oh! Now I remember! This is a powerhouse cast of actors. Not a bad seed in the lot. Ving Rhames and Laurence Fishburne have longer lists of credits than Cruise! Maggie Q as 'Zen' was notable, she held her own in a testosterone filled cast lineup. Hope to see her in more movies.Don't know what all the fuss is about Tom Cruise, and this being a sinking ship year for him. Last year's offering, 'The War Of The Worlds,' was a terrible movie. Terrible script. Terrible everything. Don't base your opinion of this Cruise movie from his last one. Mission Impossible III is very, very good. Cruise does an excellent job as lead actor in it.My only critique of him, is his trademark way of showing intense emotion. By whispering. A. La. William. Shatner. But he does that in every movie. This movie isn't a dud. I was surprised that it was so good. Go see this movie! The theatre I saw it in had all age demographics sitting there to watch it. There wasn't the usual rude people in there. You know. The ones that gather to: yak about knitting, gossip, answer their business cell phones, or giggle because THAT boy (or girl) was over there. Nor were there any seat kickers. I'm sure the gross ones were there. Their shoes experience: sidewalk spit, dog pooh or gardening manure every week. The same ones that hang them over the seats in front of them. But there was so much action on screen, they didn't keep them up for long. The sign of a good movie.For the record, I do have adhd. I wasn't cured, but have better days than others. Some things are capable of holding my attention. This movie is one of them. It's action packed, did I mention that?! Don't compare this movie to War Of The Worlds. Nor the idiotic media that have nothing better to do than be legal or illegal Peeping (on) Toms. Remember, those celebrity magazines are made up crap to make money. For the grocery store, distributors and magazine owners. Mission Impossible is a movie worth seeing. Suspend the reality of real life hucksters.",Null,0,0,16 May 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Computer Graphics Are Very Good
","I liked the background scenery best in this movie than any other I've seen, including Polar Express. Very bright and positive feel to it for viewers. Personally, I enjoyed the first Ice Age movie. But I realize that I am not the intended audience for this movie. Note the previews are all for kids. Which was nice to see in a way, that they have some G-rated choices coming up.This is a great movie for it's intended audience of grade 7 or less. Yet it's not intolerable to sit through it as an adult. Some bozo behind me commented after every children's movie preview. Negatively. Loudly. 'Lame. Stupid. Idiotic.' I turned around. Everyone turned to stare at him. It was a miserable man of about 60, sitting with people approx ages: 40, 30, 10, 12 and 8. His companions all told him to: SHHHH! He slunk down in his chair and began enjoying Ice Age. Some people need to be reminded. Some movies aren't made for them, but that doesn't mean you have to ruin it for kids. This is a great movie choice for caregivers to let children see. It is definitely a true G-rated movie. They really enjoyed it in the theatre, lots of giggles.Characters: Manny, Sid and Diego are back. 'Ellie,' is introduced and provides some amusing ... stuff. I'd love to quote her about the species of mammoths, but I won't spoil anything. Scrat is an even funnier 'distraction' than the first Ice Age movie. Scrat reminds me of Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner.SPOILER: This movie leaves the door open for another sequel.",Null,0,0,23 April 2006
Crash," Film searches deeply within
","It's been quiet some time since this movie came out. I saw it when it was first released in theatres. I'm back to comment on it, as it got some bashing for it's Oscar awards. Frankly, in the year 2005 - there weren't any top notch, note worthy films of mass appeal. There wasn't.I remember thinking: This movie will be overlooked. Theoretically, the award voters only remember movies from the last few months of a calendar year. I was surprised to see Crash was nominated - they hadn't forgotten it. I haven't forgotten that movie either. It's one of the rare times that a movie connects with an audience. It makes you: squirm, wince, look away like you've been slapped, slack jawed - the gamut of human emotions.People who blow off this movie can't relate to it, because their lives have been truly untouched. Untouched by, and naive of anything as traumatically experienced by the characters in this movie. The characters in this movie attempt this as well. To be insensitive to others' emotions and traumas. And the cause-and-effect they and others have on each other in the world. They portray realistic people trying to carry on in a cold unfeeling world.This world where people blow this movie off. They have not experienced what the characters have, nor know of anyone close to them that has. The world of soap bubbles, balloons, cars for birthdays, and occasionally family members that die of very old age.I wasn't a huge fan of Matt Dillon and his filmography of d-uh characters. Crash was the 12th movie I've seen him in. This is the first one that Dillon impressed me with. (The Flamingo Kid was enjoyable, and still makes me laugh, but I digress.) Matt Dillon was strikingly realistic in this movie. His character was beyond three dimensional. The entire cast was noteworthy, and it's difficult to pick just one outstanding actor in it. He was nominated for an Oscar in a supporting role. That's a puzzle to me. If you've seen the movie, it's an interwoven multi-story lined movie. There were no leads in this movie. It's that strong of a powerhouse cast.This movie kept me awake for much of the night afterwards. It was disturbingly realistic. I know people like those people. It was only the second movie I walked out of in my entire life. The first one was Mississippi Burning. That one, I left completely, and never saw it until it came out on video. With Crash, well I'm older now. With that, I left and paced the lobby during a particular scene. It was too much for me to watch. I cameback, and the person I went with filled me in on those five minutes.",Null,3,10,9 March 2006
Capote," Worthy of watching
","This film became available in a nearby theatre just recently. I saw it last weekend. It's a pity that it's been in such limited release in movie house around here. I went into the room not knowing who Truman Capote was. I did a quick google on him before leaving. Something about him being a writer. Oh. Okay. Wasn't much to go on there.The sets, wardrobe and cinematography were brilliantly done for this movie. I like period pieces that look like - the places you've been where time hasn't changed. The acting was very well done by the entire cast. Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Truman Capote) appears to have nailed the real Capote's personality. For that, I go on clips from the Johnny Carson show. The way Capote talked was unusual and uniquely his own style. It's amazing that he was apparently openly gay in the old boy's clubs of NYC. In the 1950's?! That he downplayed it, heading south - that seemed like someone would do in that era. Heck, I'm guessing it's still done today in the Bible belt.Capote said what people wanted to hear. Other times, he'd say/do the most eccentric things. I don't know if he was deliberately eccentric, or merely seeking attention. He reminded me of Andy Warhol. I just googled that name. It's not a surprise that they knew each other.Capote scanned a newspaper in NYC and decided to arrive on a small town doorstep to write about a family that was murdered. The small town reacted in different ways. Sometimes it required the help of his best friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener). Keener was great as a supporting actor. She delivered some of the best lines in the movie. The funniest scene being when her screenplay To Kill A Mockingbird becomes a success. I was surprised to learn that he was 'connected' to that classic movie somehow.The evolution of prisoner Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr) is gradual, and you sort of want to cheer for the underdog. Capote's swings of concern and indifference are what this movie is mainly about. Why was he that way? There didn't seem to be an answer, other than he did what was in his own best interests. Only Harper Lee knew him for what he really was. This movie left a lot open to speculation. Unless you are willing to do research on the man. I recommend not doing that until you see the movie. I take this film to be a depiction and interpretation. If you want extreme depth, you watch the Biography or Documentary channels. This is a factual and cinematic presentation to me.",Null,0,0,9 March 2006
Quantum of Solace," No heroics to fix it this. It flat lines.
","This movie was lackluster in presentation. The previews make it look like an action movie, and it's any but. The cinematography: The look is dark. Presumably, it's supposed to portray emotions. It does not do that. It's no where near the way Dark Knight pulled it off earlier this year. The view is mainly of darkness, but the actors are not believable in portraying their characters with just 'a look.' Dialogue: Save for once or twice, there is no witty dialogue. Nor is there anything that makes you think: Hey, that character is really intelligent or whatnot. There's not enough background info given for a viewer to say: Oh, that's where he/she is coming from. Without that, a viewer has no empathy, understanding, or baseline to go with. Lead Actor: I didn't go to watch it in a theatre. No intent to, as Daniel Craig was a name I never recognized. He looked sort of familiar though, and looking at his credits I knew why. I've seen Golden Compass. He was incredibly memorable in the Power Of One. Yet, I don't think he pulled off being the main character this time around. His performance did not exude what you expect in a James Bond actor. He is not conventionally good-looking, nor does he resemble a ladies man. The classy, debonair part is missing. 'Bond's' air of confidence comes off as total arrogance in this movie. Casino Royale was a really good movie all around. Some people I know went to the movie theatre more than twice to see it. The difference this time seems to be the director. Both writers credited for this film were credited for the last Bond. So. What it comes down to is, I wouldn't pay to see a movie with that director again. Not when tickets are $11 each, geez.",Null,2,2,23 November 2008
Twilight," Through Blue Hues, Another Vampire Movie
","We watched this on Blu Ray in high def. Only one person in the room has read the book(s?). I'm not sure why this was tagged a black and white film, and I'm not colour blind. Why do the books have a dedicated following? Unknown. Guys in the room decided early on that it must be a chick flick. A woman in the room disagreed. The storyline was kind of sluggish and it took awhile to be drawn into it. The actors are also basically no names to me, even though they're getting regular media coverage here in B.C. while filming the next installment. I don't think they're the next big thing, but I do think they'll be around for the long haul as character actors in movies to come. Overall, the movie was okay, not a waste of rental money, and we all ended up agreeing that yeah, it was okay. Was the acting good? I'm kind of up in the air about that. Followers of the book(s) seem to think they did a good job. As the rest of us still don't know much about the books, it was agreed that we didn't really have to read up on it to get what was going on. I can't say I've seen a lot of vampire movies. I do know the ones I have seen are fairly generic, and interchangeable. Save for the Anne Rice movie, Vampire Chronicles. I get the feeling that vampire movies are Supposed to be generic. There is always a main foible involved in haunting-style movies, and it's predictable as pigeon turd. But this movie like I said, is alright. There are few turns on vampires vs ordinary human story lines, though this movie has some interesting angles to offer. I liked that the time line was not jumping all over the place like most vampire movies. It's worth renting, but you have to be in the right mode to be watching it. Maybe if I had read the books, I would give it a different rating. As it stands, this is what I give it for just watching it for what it appears to be - without the books to tell me what I should think.",Null,0,1,28 March 2009
