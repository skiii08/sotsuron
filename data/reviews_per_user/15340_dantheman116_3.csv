It," Sinister, Jumpy and Creepy but awesome
","Im usually very fussy about movies that I want to go and see because lets face it, it's not cheap these days to go to the cinema especially when they charge 4pounds for popcorn therefore you want the movie that your going to see be the perfect film. But anyways I decided to go to the cinema with my girlfriend after seeing the reception that this movie received with all positive reviews and let me tell you, you know a movie is good when your left thinking about it for days afterwards. If you are wanting a movie that will leave you thinking about it and wanting to read the book afterwards then this is the movie for you. This is what happens when the movie is based on amazing source material from the likes of Stephen King who is a prestigious horror author whose written the likes of the Shining, Salems lot, misery and many more. The movie was jumpy and the clown was very sinister/creepy but the movie also had a lot of charm to it catching a late 80s feel to it. THIS IS THE BEST HORROR FILM I've seen in a long time and the let's face the Horror Genre has long been in dire need for a film like this. The characters were on point, you actually cared for most of them. So character development for each character was perfect. There were also plenty of comical elements in the film with also the right amount of shocking scary moments. In all,my suggestion would be to take heed in all the positive reviews and follow suit with going to watch this great compelling tense story in the cinema to get the most from this movie. The clown in my opinion, was probably the 2nd best clown performance after the Joker (Heath Ledger)that I have ever seen, so full credit to the actor who played him. I would not be surprised if he was tipped to play the Joker in future batman films. But yes you will not be disappointed with this movie, it has everything that a 15year old and older would ever want. So Enjoy!!!",10,7,16,12 September 2017
Suicide Squad," Worst movie ever
",I am going to keep this short and sweet. If not the worst film in 2016 probably the worst film to come out in my lifetime and I'm 26! it makes batman vs superman Oscar worthy in comparison. Its so bad that its almost as if the movie was a fan made video made on YouTube. they are killing great dc comics when will they learn.I never write reviews but this one I FELT COMPELLED TO SO NO ONE WASTES THEIR MONEY OR TIME.And I've checked that they will be making another one in 2019 if it's anything like that and with the same cast then I don't want to know too be brutally honest.Will Smith will be re-watching that and shaking his head in embarrassment.,1,3,5,2 February 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Mediocre, a new hope rehashed.
","OK so where do I begin. Firstly people that have given this a positive review are obviously biast Star Wars fans who would enjoy anything with the name Star Wars on it but unfortunately you need to review it as a movie. Don't get me wrong it was OK but I agree with a lot of the negative reviews here, that it is basically a rehash of a New Hope. It was as if the director was too scared too come up with new original ideas. As bad as the prequels were at least they were original! We also got really cool stuff from the prequels, for example, pod racing, darth maul, duel of the fates, clone wars, young yoda, anakin turning evil and the jedi council. But this movie has basically copied new hope, I thought Rogue one was a better movie because at least they took a risk although most of that film was a little too bland, the ending of that film was amazing. But anyway very disappointed with this, I wanted to see something different and also the actress who plays Rey was soooooo wooden. Also Disney do we need a Han solo movie, why not give us a boba fett movie or a movie on the old republic. I wish Disney knew which direction to take Star Wars but unfortunately they don't. I hope they bring out a movie to prove me wrong.",2,11,84,14 September 2017
