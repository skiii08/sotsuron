The Benchwarmers," What can I say? This movie gets a home run on comedy (and everything else)
","Heder was seen in Napoleon Dynamite in 2004, but that's not as fresh and LOL hysterical as The Benchwarmers. The Benchwarmers is put into three lines: Rob Schnieder (Gus Matthews (a.k.a Gus Bus)(laughs)), David Spade (Richie Goodman (a.k.a Richie #itchy)) and Jon Heder (Clark Reedees (a.k.a Clark the Dork)). These past nerds form a baseball team that doesn't know how to hit or catch. These guys will tickle your funny bone and won't stop!! Stupid, yes, but this is stupid in a good way. A rank of #4 on the best (yes, best) films of 2006, it's freaken awesome!!!!!!!! If you can't find my review useful and somehow find to hate this movie, go back to Napoleon Dynamite. Or just resort to Monster House and School for Scoundrels to keep up with Heder. (He's also gonna appear in Surf's Up this year.) If you have no sense of humor, just ignore this review all together.",Null,0,0,19 February 2007
Miracle," I just couldn't grow to like this
","My parents got the DVD of this and I saw it. Twice. I didn't enjoy it either time. My mind cannot focus on anything that is going on because it is filled with too much light conversation. My mind also has trouble because it's in the head of a person in a sports-loving family who doesn't love sports too much himself. The only miracle is the one that actually happened and that this film portrays. This movie didn't make me unleash my temper, but it's just the hardest thing in the world to focus on. Kurt showed to me that he's a great actor in Sky High, but I don't blame him for being in this. You don't have to agree with me, but this is my honest opinion.",Null,1,8,30 January 2007
Spider-Man 3," Nice try, critics.
","This movie is awesome. It has a lot of action and it's very suspenseful and dark. Critics don't like it, huh? Too much time and romance? Not to much, really. Maguire's character would be nothing without the stress of villains and his crush. Don't bomb Spider-Man 3 just because you thought there was to much romance. I like this the best of the three Spider-Man movies, which gets me all pumped for Spider-Man 4. The amount of villains and the power they have are awesome and are absolutely evil, which is what I wanted for this film. If you have yet to see this movie, don't listen to critics or anyone who says that this film is trash. They are wrong, and I am totally itching to see this film in theaters again. It would be so sweet if I did that. ***1/2 out of ****",Null,0,2,9 May 2007
Ratatouille," Another outstanding Disney-Pixar masterpiece!
","Ratatouille made me hungry when I came out of the theater. It was around 7:00 PM, but I loved this movie. I'm glad this film made it to the Top 250 because movies like this one truly belong there. And the advertisements didn't even repel me. They were good ads and made me want to go to it so bad. This should get nominated for a couple Oscars next year and win one of them. That is not for a long time, but it's something to look forward to. In conclusion, this cooks up a feast you'll never forget. I hope you don't want to forget it at all. This is my new favorite movie, and that probably won't change until the film Wall-E comes out. Pixar is the greatest film company ever!Edit: Now my favorite movie is The Simpsons Movie.",Null,1,4,5 July 2007
Transformers," Can somebody say overrated? Pathetic.
","I thought to myself before I saw this, 'If it's done right, it will get a 9/10.' I had that in mind. The movie actually started slow and attempted to build, but even the battles are boring. When it's robot vs. human, I know the outcome of the battle already, and I hated that.. But it seems that the second part of the movie is actually somewhat skillfully made. Shia LeBeouf was great as Sam Witwhicky it also had some great jokes. I swear, it works better as a comedy than an action flick, even though there's more action than humor. Still, everyone else seemed to like it, but my experience wasn't transformed enough. I'll watch a sequel with my family if it comes out. Who knows? It might be worth it.Humor: 6/10 Action:1/10 Plot: 2/10 Overall Rating: 3/10",Null,0,2,14 August 2007
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Vintage claymation is fine with me.
","Okay, I've seen this movie three times, twice on TV and once in theaters (the theaters screening was yesterday with 3-D) and I think the movie is best watched in 3-D. This film is by no means bad. In fact, it's very cleaver and fun to see a vintage claymation movie anywhere. More examples are the Wallace & Gromit shorts that played way back then. I think 'Nightmare' was the first feature-length claymation movie, right? Anyway, don't answer. It's pretty hard to do that in a comment. Don't look for this question by me in the message boards.I try not to have my rating for this film at the beginning because I think 3-D is better than 2-D. If it is there, I will try to get rid of it. Anyway, here's my final verdict.2-D: 8 out of 10 3-D: 9 out of 10",Null,2,2,21 October 2007
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Greater hockey matches have been played
","This is yet another Disney sports drama that didn't make me feel anything but bored. First hockey and now golf? Not a fan of sports (or very good at regular golf), this film spells trouble for me, especially since I enjoy real hockey matches ten times more. When I saw this movie, I knew that this is it. Disney doesn't know how to make half-way descent sports dramas. In fact, I don't think anyone can (I'm a teenager).That's why I decided that I'm gonna hate Invincible, so, why even go for it? I'm not a movie critic. Bottom line, if you want to see the second of the sports dramas that Disney has dared made, this film is for you by all means. If you hated Miracle (like me), completely ignore this flick by all means. * out of ****",Null,0,4,7 February 2007
Jaws," Top 250? What the...?
","No, I am not crazy. Jaws shouldn't be on the top 250 list because it is just about as good as a rotten fish sandwich! Jaws bites you in the butt with the jaws of boredom, not the jaws of life. For one thing, it's not scary. It's just really gross, like with all the blood in the water. And that bloody corpse underwater. This film has to much blood to be rated PG today. It would be PG-13 or even R today. Another thing that makes this film crappy is that it is completely unimaginative served with a side of boredom. If you still want a will to stay in the water, avoid at all costs. Trust me, you have better things to do than watching people get murdered by a stinky cheese shark!!! I don't even know why so many people like it. Trust me, it's totally not worth it.",Null,5,26,16 February 2007
Happy Feet," Frostbite and Fantastic Music
","Okay, so Happy Feet wasn't a great movie. It was more like what you get when you cross-breed a fantastic soundtrack with an iffy plot. I can't say I hate this, but I would have hated it if there was no soundtrack. However, some of the music is part of the plot, but I was confounded at some of the logic this flick had. Such as Mumble not being able to sing because he was dropped as an egg. Also, in the scene when Mumble was put into a zoo area for humans (REAL humans) to watch him, it looked really weird. Ramone had most of the humor and there wasn't much else to it. Plot: 3/10 (*1/2 out of ****) Music: 9/10 (***1/2 out of ****) Humor: 6/10 (**1/2 out of ****) Overall appeal: 6/10 (**1/2 out of ****)",Null,0,0,11 August 2007
The Birds," The Scariest 'Hitchcock' I've Ever Seen (I Haven't Seen Psycho)
","Birds fighting mankind seems unlikely, but Hitchcock makes it happen. I am not a horror fan, but 2 hour The Birds made me forget all that and I enjoyed the suspense, thrill, and horror. This is Alfred Hitchcock's best in my opinion. However, the only movies he's directed that I've seen are Rear Window, Dial M for Murder, The Birds, Rope, Marnie, Vertigo, and The Man Who Knew Too Much. This movie brought much fear to me and I wish that they weren't making a sequel because they will ruin the whole thing. This was smart, suspenseful, and gave me the feeling that Hitchcock could do anything. He can, too (including appear in his directed films. In this one, he appears coming out of the pet shop about a minute after the credits). I urge you who love suspense that have not seen The Birds yet to do so. You'll have the thrill of a lifetime.",Null,0,0,24 November 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Worth ten tons of donuts
","This movie is everything I expected out of it. It has great gags and a crafty plot. No wounder it wasn't revealed until later. I had a great time seeing this movie and wish I would have seen the part where Lenny tells Homer about the donuts (stupid bladder!) and the credits scenes where Maggie asks for a sequel. Nevertheless, those details were leaked out afterwords but I still wish I would have been able to see them. I'll wait for DVD. (Spare your illegal downloading, YouTube!) Also, great opening. I especially liked the chalkboard gag, 'I will not illegally download this movie.' All gags were also excellent. Now a shout out to all haters: Haw-Haw!Humor: 10/10 Plot: 10/10 Characters: 10/10 Overall Rating: 10/10",Null,2,6,28 July 2007
