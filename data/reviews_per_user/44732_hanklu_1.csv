The Blair Witch Project," Admirable job, but I just didn't get it
","Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have done an admirable job of scaring many viewers. Personally, I don't get it. It's obvious that they are talented, I just really didn't get frightened by the setting. I wasn't engulfed in it.The cast was also earnest and came across real. Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams gave it their all.Neal Fredericks, who shot the movie, deliberately did the shaky-cam thing. Again, for many, it worked. As far as shaky cams go, I suppose he got the desired effect.I'm going to watch this movie again to see exactly what it was that I missed, or maybe I didn't miss anything at all.",5,0,1,3 August 2008
