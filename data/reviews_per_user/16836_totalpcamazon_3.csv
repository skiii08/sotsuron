First Man," Better than I expected. Excellent film
","This was an EXCELLENT film. Disclaimer: Not everyone will feel this way about the movie. This isn't a 'Hollywood' movie about Neil Armstrong. This isn't Apollo 13, or even The Right Stuff. The director chose to make a film that puts the viewer there, watching the story and events unfold as they were. The cinematographer did a wonderful job of recreating the authentic look and feel of the 60's. Much of the film was shot almost 'home movie' style adding to the experience. If you grew up in the time period, you will really appreciate this. If you were fascinated by the early space program, you will like this. If not, maybe not so much, as it's a little technical and plodding. Again, this is a film about the story and events, and about the man. You are watching the events happen. That being said, it did give some nice insight into Armstrong, and his family life, and some events that helped shape the man. STELLAR cast, interesting music choices, not just a bunch of period songs thrown in to sell a soundtrack. Gosling deserves recognition for his performance. He embodied the man for this movie. My recommendation, if you enjoy good cinema, see it",9,2,6,25 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Don't agree with the critics
","#1. there was NO chemistry between the two characters. NONE. I've seen more chemistry in 10th Grade, and I got a D. The movie was a series of 2 or 3 minutes scenes haphazardly cut together. There was no continuity, no buildup, no story building. It seemed like they took all the First Takes and just pieced them together. The acting was mostly flat. I felt nothing for the characters. I didn't buy his drunk. There was no reason he ended up at her club in the beginning, and no reason he was attracted to her, or her to him. Nothing. No build up, no story, just a bunch of dialogue pieced together. The songs were forgettable, and most just silly cliche'd crap. His relationship with his brother had no real emotion. I don't know WHAT Dave Chapelle was doing there, and the scene between them on the lawn was useless. I don't know WHAT the hell Dice was doing there, except maybe he's buddies with Cooper, and Cooper wanted to give him a part. The Rehab scene was useless. I felt nothing at the end when she sang her song, and that was HUGE in the Streisand one. The love scenes between them, I think even they didn't feel them, and that's why they were cut so short. I thought the idea of turning Gaga's character into Gaga was a poor choice. She had said earlier, when she was advised to dye her hair platinum, that she wouldn't do that, it wasn't true to her. Then she colors her hair. Why? So Gaga fans would be happy? I felt NOTHING of her rise and his fall. It was just flat. He was the same throughout the movie, and so was she, only she colored and styled her hair. But the thing that REALLY pissed me off, was his suicide at the end. Forgetting the fact that we didn't feel with him that it was his justifiable end, it RUINED the Streisand film. In the Streisand version, John Norman leaves in his sports car, listening to her music, drunk, and under the influence, and he is seen driving recklessly, and speeding, and then it cuts to after the accident. It is left to the viewers' imagination, Did he kill himself on purpose, or was it an accident caused by his state? In this one, Boom, he hangs himself. Thanks, Brad. Thanks for just killing everything. And lastly, Gaga is NO Streisand. She wants to be, and tried real hard to be, but she is not. She's the American Idol version. I didn't get any authenticity from her songs, or or acting. She wasn't bad, in the acting department, and maybe under a better director, she could've risen to a very good performance. She has a good voice, but she just didn't move me at all. As for Cooper's directing of himself. This was his worst performance, imo. Even in stinker movies, of which he's done a couple, I've always believed him, and liked his performances. Here, I didn't buy a second of it. He needs a good director, and a better editor to guide him.",4,2,6,20 October 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Would've been a far more interesting film had they gone with the original title
","This could've been a much more interesting movie had they titled it Thor: Fraggle Rock. As it stands, another lame boring Stupor Hero flick. (yawn)",1,5,11,3 April 2019
