Alien 3," Never before has a film had such an undeserving backlash as this.
","What is the problem, people? A superbly directed, dark film with the storyline beautifully encapsulated by this. Yes, it's not as good as Aliens, but it stands on its own, with Weaver's Ripley deepening beyond that milestone. (Only to be completely ruined by 'Resurrection'.)",7,0,4,4 April 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Gone! Itsallgone!
","Oh dear. The meticulously constructed 'Alien' universe and characters have all been shunned by the director, Juenet, in favour of slime and gunge! Ripley is now a heartless creature, totally disjointed from her horrific past and no better for it. The Aliens are no longer horrifying, as they are brought right into the limelight, just where they don't belong. We see far too much of them. While there's some good cinematography, this can't detract from the film's overall departure from the dark, understated spirit of the franchise. This is especially damaged by the 'new' alien that appears at the end. Danny Boyle should have done this.",5,0,0,4 April 1999
The Beach," Oh dear.
","Read 'The Beach' by Alex Garland. Marvel at the strong, consistent plotline; at the well-defined and evolving characters. Fixate on the mastery with which Garland handles and twists Richard's descent into madness around the reader.See that the movie comes from the same director/producer/screenwriter team as the superb 'Trainspotting', and get very excited.Actually see the movie. Be very, very, very disappointed.Realise that screenwriter John Hodge has not even read 'The Beach' by Alex Garland. See that the only thing that the film retains from the book is the names of the characters and, of course, The Beach. Realise that while one or two of the events from the book remain, the film is so different, that there was no point.It should have been called 'The Pretense'.",6,1,2,26 October 2000
Alien," Yet to be surpassed
","This film is an utter classic. It's good in the same way that 'The Catcher in the Rye' is. You can't tell why, it just IS.    The story certainly wasn't especially original; the film itself was one-track (Though some - myself included - would argue that that's part of its individuality); but the chasing scifi pack is so far behind that it probably will stand on it's own for generations. It's too bad it wasn't allowed to stand alone, since to a certain to degree the sequels have diluted the formula of a film concentrating on one thing; terror. No time wasted on sub-plots or character development, or expensive sets and special effects.    The fact that the film is so good without all the additions that most people seem to feel films must have these days (Don't get me wrong, sometimes they help!), speaks volumes about its maturity, its directness, and also about moviemakers/moviegoers today. An outstanding example.",9,0,1,1 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," 'Not too bad at all...'
","A rather good film overall... it seems a little empty in places and generally uncertain in it's message to the viewer, but it maintains the attention well. S Some of the scares are pretty tacky and overblown, but with well-executed buildups. The twist is excellently planned, and suprised me - though it's a little odd that the fact revealed by the twist does not have a noticable effect on Cole during the preceding rolls of film. The performance of the adult cast, while convincing in themselves, is totally eclipsed by that of Haley Joel Osmet, who is simply SUPERB. Perhaps even the best performance ever by a child actor. Very, VERY intense, emotional, and moving - particularly the scene where he is locked in a cupboard at a 'friend's' birthday party. Toni Collette is the only other actor who comes close - The scene where she discovers a previously unknown truth about her mother is excellently played, despite the unusual setting for such a scene. Bruce Willis missed an opportunity with this however, playing little more than a (admittedly positive) variation on his recent characters' emotionally dry, squinty-eyed selves. Moreover, it seems a little like the filmmakers didn't get the time to include everything they wanted in this movie. I found it somewhat unconvincing that once Cole 'tests' the theory of why he is being visited, everything is suddenly perfectly cleared up, and the film ends after 15 minutes. No 'journey' by Cole, up to this point. Having said that, neither of those points detract significantly from this otherwise very entertaining picture. Go see it.",Null,0,0,22 November 1999
The Matrix," What's real, and what isn't... oh, I don't care
","This movie SUCKED, big time. Yes, the special effects were sensational. Yes, the story was mildly interesting (What there was of it). But as Independance Day famously proved, you need more than that to make a good movie; but not, apparently, to sell one. Besides the hugely cliched and excruciating dialogue, Keanu Reeves continued his tradition of lending no personality whatsoever to his character, much as the rest of the 'actors' in this terrible, terrible film. The only chap with even a small measure of integrity and personality was the great Laurence Fishburne, and he certainly was far from at his best. I didn't care one jot who lived or died when I was watching this movie, although I must admit it was rather satisfying when the infuriatingly smug agent was finally dispatched. Anyone who genuinely liked The Matrix is nothing more than a conveyor belt mass-production social drone who'll swallow any old hype and sacrifice any amount of dignity for the sake of a few nice effects. Just a normal Keanu Reeves film, then.",4,1,3,13 June 1999
