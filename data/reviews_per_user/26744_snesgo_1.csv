The Blair Witch Project," How scary the truth can be
","The Blair Witch Project is not a horror story, it is the edited footage discovered of the horrifying ordeal that three college students face. In 1994, they disappeared and the case was never solved, then, a year later, Heather Donahue's backpack of film is found in a place that hasn't been touched by human hands for more than a century, a place it couldn't logically be. They climb up a slope near the end that is at nearly a 45 degree angle, in a place where the hills were only that steep over a hundred years ago. It is not a story at all. It is a factual account, generally accepted, though, as a fictional film. Just read backlogged papers, or check out the Blair Witch Dossier as compiled by D.A. Stern.",10,1,3,13 October 2006
