The New World," Painful
","Unfortunately, this movie's attempt to be 'art' gets drowned in a painfully slow process. When just about every moment of this too-lengthy movie is overly dramatic with a slow-motion feel, its art loses any impact it may have had. There is some beautiful cinematography, but again it does not make up for the ponderous movement of the scenes and interaction between characters. Although the story was obviously about Captain Smith and Pocahontas, their relationship would have meant more to the viewer if other characters were more strongly built around them. The viewer also loses sense of time, especially when Pocahontas is suddenly very fluent with English with only a hint of how that happened. Two of the four of us watching it just couldn't handle the snail's pace, and the remaining two said it should have ended at least 15 minutes before it did. Even the action scenes were awkward with odd punctuations of the character Smith's thoughts. This story had awesome potential but was a huge letdown.",1,45,76,13 May 2006
