The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The weakest part of the trilogy/quadrilogy, until now
","There are some exciting scenes in this installment but it is not enough to save it. As usual, following the latest Hollywood standards the movies in the series are following a downward spiral. Every new movie is weaker than its predecessor. There are some pretty cringe-worthy dialogs in this one, for example (it's not an exact quote) when Katniss wonders that Gale remembers their kiss, he said something like I will not forget it until I die, perhaps not even then'. KMN. I mean, is there a single human being in the world who would say something like that? It is sooo cliché, farrago for teenagers, which in my opinion are today a little bit smarter than that. Or perhaps not. Anyway I hope they will try to fix things in the final sequel.",5,3,4,26 February 2015
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Elementary, dear Watson
",I rate this movie with 1 because I expected better movie than its prequel which was a very solid viewing but that is not a reason for this review. I only wanted to point out that it was a serious mistake for Holmes to send Dr.Watson to find (or deduce!) the assassin in the final moments of the movie. He is trying to find a killer with complicated methods but he only had to consider this: - Madame Simsa's brother Rene (as she is of course) is French. - The easiest person for him to imitate is also French. - It is not easy for him to imitate British or German person because the languages are too different. - So only logical deduction would be - French ambassador. Probably something Holmes would have discovered in no-time. Or maybe not. Too bad that director has tried to make this movie interesting with kung-fu skills and slow/stop motion instead with cerebral powers of the world's greatest detective.,1,7,12,8 May 2012
Skyfall," Solid Bond but nothing special
","Movie begins with a very good chase in Istanbul which is shot in beautifully exciting manner. The motorcycle chase on the city's rooftops is something new and the classical shooting scene on the train is made fresh with an excavator and massive destruction. But from this moment the movie slows down and I believe the director wanted to make the story more personal for Bond this way. We see Bond gets shot by his partner Moneypenny, his resurrection, his physical and psychological tests in MI6 which he fails. All that hints (or should hint) to an agent whose best days are behind him, something that could have been used to create more drama or conflict. But then his boss M' intervenes and puts him back into active service, and that was it. He is back in the game and kicks bad guys a..ess with ease. The only time we see his physical weakness is when he tries to shoot a glass on top of someones head. His hand trembles and he misses. But after that he singlehandedly kills 5 or 6 henchmen. His antagonist in this movie is a disillusioned ex MI6 agent who has been betrayed by M' to the Chinese, tortured for months and failed to kill himself with poison which left him partially disfigured. The problem with this character is that he is considered as an epitome of evil by some of his associates (like beautiful Severine who trembles when she thinks of betraying him), but his brutality is never shown on screen, nor does he look intimidating (remember Zorin in A View to a Kill', his gaze is that of a madman, chillingly played by Christopher Walken). His potential as a worlds best computer hacker is never used for anything grand like it is the case with other Bonds enemies. OK, he did blow up a MI6 headquarters and managed to expel inhabitants of some unnamed island by computer trick (which also doesn't make sense, the government would probably send someone on-site to see what actually happened, but never mind). He only wants to take vengeance on M' and to that end he let himself be captured and brought to London. After his escape he goes with his henchmen to the M's public inquiry and then we have some boring gunfight. M escapes with Bond to Scottland with a plan to lure their enemy to Bond family estate (named Skyfall, if you wondered about the movie title), where they will make their stand. I have no idea what is so great about this plan, because M as a chief of MI6 can probably ask for some police help. Or some Special forces. Or some Army tanks and helicopters. But whatever. They go to Scottland and manage to defend them self with two hunting rifles, one pistol and a knife against two dozen mercenaries and a helicopter. In the end bad guy bites the dust, M dies of her injuries and Bond returns to be the best MI6 agent there is. As for Bond girls, we have charming Moneypenny and stunning Severine. Severine quickly and pointlessly dies in the middle of the movie and Moneypenny ends being a secretary of new MI6 director, which is debasement for a field agent and a sharpshooter but maybe thats is how MI6 works. All in all a Bond movie which is on par with Quantum of solace'. OK, maybe a little bit better.",7,2,9,12 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Finally - a real Iron Man
","I must say I went reluctantly to see this movie. The first two parts were in my opinion nothing special but for the sake of completism I did see Iron Man 3 and I am very glad that I did. It is a spectacular movie with a superb, almost epic music, composed by Brian Tyler. This time we have a very different Tony Stark then in the first two parts. In the past he was all show, a playboy who wants to attract attention. Now we see him suffer from anxiety attacks and fear after the trauma he experienced in the movie The Avengers'. He lives alone with his girlfriend Pepper in his mansion and he has become a quieter personality, obsessed with his power-suits which give him sense of security. The problem with the first two parts was lack of suspense. We knew that his suits will protect him from harm, and to be honest his enemies were not stronger than he. Now we have an interesting enemy for him, an illusive terrorist named the Mandarin who wants to punish USA and at the same time educate' US president. He is a mixture between Bin Laden and Fu Manchu. He represents a blending of all western prejudices and fears regarding the eastern civilizations from the middle to the far east. He is a shadowy figure, surrounded by his fanatical followers, philosophical, honourless and extremely cruel. In this movie we also have a contemporary aspect concerning the war on terror and the connection between the US politicians and the oil industry. But not everything is as it seems, and that would be a major spoiler which I will not mention here. There are some other villains with superpowers which are very dangerous indeed. This time Tony Stark does not have much of his hi-tech gadgets at his disposal, only a single malfunctioning power-suit, which is a very good thing story-wise because it creates suspense. Everything is more difficult for him this time and finally we see him in action using his brains instead of power-suits. With this limitations, we see Tony Stark make a transition from superhero to hero, something the audience can relate to more easily. All in all, this is excellent action movie, with clever story, interesting twists and explosive ending. Highly recommended.",9,3,15,29 April 2013
Child 44," A Hit and Miss Thing
","I haven't read Tom Smiths book Child 44 but the topic of this movie was interesting so I gave it a shot. It is a solid movie with fine performances from the actors but the most interesting thing of the movie is of course a portrayal of Stalin-Era Soviet Union and the treatment of criminals and citizens in it. In this story we see a series of child-murders in an indoctrinated society where there can't be such sick individuals like serial killers. The society's dogma prevents an efficient investigation of the case and it all happens in the time of paranoid hunt for foreign agents and counter-revolutionary elements. The strongest part of the story is the analysis of unjust society, where anything can be declared a treason no matter how powerful a single individual in this system is (as a matter of fact, the only person never accused in any crime in Soviet Union was a General Secretary of the Party. All others were at some time find guilty of something, regardless if this person is a WW2 hero, Army general, MGB general etc). The weak part of the movie is the Holiwoodesque battle of a lonely hero (well in this case he has a wife) against impossible odds. I will not go into detail, but I will say that the killer is killed, the main antagonist in a form of a corrupt MGB officer is also killed and our hero is redeemed in the eyes of the state, which I believe never happened in Stalins SU. Those declared guilty by society have been punished – sent into imprisonment in some camp or executed, because the state was never wrong. All in all, the movie is not bad but if you would like to know more about Stalins State I can recommend two excellent books: Arthur Koestlers Eclipse at Noon' and from Danilo Ki A Tomb for Boris Davidovich'.",5,3,6,14 August 2015
Gravity," Suspense from the beginning until the end
","I will not elaborate much about this movie because it is not really about the story, it is about atmosphere. The plot is simple enough, we have two astronauts stranded in space without communication with NASA or anybody else. Sandra Bulock plays a newcomer in space, subdued and probably depressed mission specialist who survives space catastrophe. With her is veteran astronaut played by George Clooney who saves her on more than one occasion and gives her moral support. The casting is right and possibly Bullocks greatest achievement on the big screen, after row of forgettable comedy movies. The photography of the movie is superb and 3D effects really contribute to the suspense. I will try to avoid spoilers because in the movies about a catastrophes there is only one question – will our hero survive or not? There are of course some scientific inaccuracies but for the sake of dramatisation, it is OK. All in all a movie which can be easily recommended but watch it in 3D.",9,2,6,7 October 2013
Fury," Full of sound and fury...you know the rest
","Well. It's difficult to write something about this movie because I don't know where to begin. First of all, I expected a more serious approach to this subject. I didn't expect to see German shock troops to be mow down like a bunch of orcs from LOTR, but whatever. Perhaps there is a reason why the US lost only' about 400.000 soldiers in that war and Germany ten times more. But in this movie all looks very naive to me, like a script from some first-person shooter. It is above all, a war-glorifying movie. Sacrifices have to be made, and the enemy must be destroyed at all costs. By all means necessary. But, the battles in this movie between remains of the German Army and the US troops are silly. Zee Germans' seem unable to hit anything with their weapons. Not even from an ambush with their enemies in the open field. A crucial battle between a German Tiger Tank and our heroes is stupid. Or better said the Germans are stupid. At one point in the battle, both crews try to get behind the opponent to hit the weakest point of the tank, but as our heroes are moving to reach the back of the Tiger, the Germans only rotate their turret as if they have no idea of the threat. And they die, of course. Furthermore, the Germans use their infantry weapons (in all stages of the movie) to attack our heroes tank, although it is a futile attempt. Crazy stuff. And the final battle between our heroes and the German SS troops is mind boggling. First of all, we see a SS-battalion (aproxx. 300 soldiers or more), armed with ancient kar98 rifles, machine-gun and couple of anti-tank weapons marching (and singing!) toward our heroes. Our protagonist spots them and runs to warn his friends. He reaches them in couple of seconds so I expected the Germans to be close, but no. Our heroes have time to argue whether they will run away or stay and fight (gues what they decided!) against many ill-equipped enemies. They set up an ambush in their immobilized tank and wait. Pleeeeenty of time to talk some more. Then the hilarity ensues, a battle that has to be seen to be believed! All of a sudden the night falls, everything is on fire, smoke everywhere. Zee Germans run left and right, confused, getting killed. They return fire from their rifles and machine-gun, and – no surprise – they do nothing! Then, after losing dozens of troops, the bad guys decide to use anti-tank weapons. Two of the rockets miss, although they are fired from about 5 meters distance and the third one manages to penetrate the armor and kill a single crew-member. Then our heroes get really mad, they shoot and reload. Shoot, reload. After some time they only shoot, no time to reload! But, there are too many storming Germans. Our heroes die, and the main protagonist survives and is rescued. All's well that ends well.",3,7,18,9 December 2014
The Hunger Games," Loved it!
","Finally a movie without hyper-inflated action scenes on steroids. I had no foreknowledge about the books and watched the movie almost accidentally. It is nice to see there are still movie directors who can tell a coherent story. Movie is beautifully shot, accompanied with melancholic music. Battle scenes are sparse bur dramatic and not overdone like the fighting scenes in the recent movies like 'Game of Shadows' where everybody seems to know some martial art. In reality fights are short and people die easily and that is how they are shown on the screen. Main character arouses sympathy and is someone who we can root for. Jennifer Lawrence looks gorgeous in every scene reminding of Diana, goddess of the Hunt. Some reviewers criticize the movie for its lack of gore claiming it is boring but that is far from true. There is no need for a movie to be brutal and bloody to be suspenseful.",9,2,7,30 March 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Too much which becomes too little
","After a long wait, a disappointing movie. Or probably the hype was too great after superb trailers. The first part was way better because we were in an uncharted territory where anything can happen, and it did - for example the destruction of planet Vulkan. Now in this movie we have by-the-numbers action and a very thin plot with a couple of not so great plot twists. The creators of the movie have managed to keep the identity of the mail villain secret and after so much speculation from the fans it has become irrelevant who he is, at least for me. The creators of the movie have played on this single card and the rest of the movie suffers greatly because of that. The main problem of this movie is, to be honest, a paper-thin plot. All that happens in the movie is as follows: a terrorist manages to eradicate half the starfleet captains and then teleports (!) to the Klingon homeworld Kronos, Kirk&Crew receive orders to find-him-and-kill-him', Kirk than decides to capture him instead, the terrorist kills couple of Klingons and then he surrenders and reveals himself as Khan (no further explanation necessary), then arrives the second villain of the movie-an admiral who wants to start a war with the Klingons and he has a brand new ship (like USS Excelsior from the original time line), there is a undramatic and chaotic space battle, some gun- and fistfights and then Khan takes over admirals ship, then follows a chase on Earth and a happy end. This plot points do not last much longer on screen, everything happens too quickly, not allowing for the suspense to build. But there are some redeeming points as well. Spock is brilliant in this movie and steals every scene he is in. I love his reasoning and his adamant moral. The new Klingons are very cool. We see that they have managed to destroy their moon Praxis and their homeworld ahead of time. And this time they did not have chancellor Gorkon to make peace with the Federation. I hope we will have relentless enemies in them for the future movies. Space battles between Enterprise and Admiral's new ship are pretty underwhelming. Enterprise is a sitting duck and keeps receiving punishment in every battle, which becomes boring after a while. Great final battle in The Undiscovered Country' is something the director could have drew an inspiration from. And of course we have Kirks sacrifice at the end so his ship and crew would live. It is a copy of Spock's death from The Wrath of Khan' and sadly it is a missed opportunity. The scene fails to be dramatic or sad or significant. In the moment where Kirk enters a radioactive warp core, I knew how he will be cured. To be honest I had hoped that Spock would try to enter this warp core and that the old Spock' would take his place, but that was an ordinary wishful thinking of an old ST fan. Benedikt Cumberbatch is superb as a villain Khan but the emotional connection between him and Kirk is absent in this movie, which makes sense because they met for the first time in this time line. Nevertheless, the screen dynamic between Khan and Kirk from The Wrath of Khan' was better. I hope that the creators of this new Star Trek will avoid similar mistakes for the future movies, because this new reboot of the series has great potential because all bets are off. Good luck next time.",7,0,4,22 May 2013
About Time," Entertaining movie with a deeper message
","About Time' starts as a comedy about time traveling man and his quest for true love. Or any love at all. But after a while the movie goes into a drama territory with surprising emotional resonance. Actually it is a movie about life and the possibilities of coping with everything that goes with it: happiness, sadness, comedy and tragedy. Tha powers of our hero come with a limitations and as in real life it is difficult and sometime impossible to achieve win-win situation. But time travel in this movie is a secondary thing, more important is one simple message that is very difficult to follow in life and that is to accept everything as it comes and to seize every moment in life like it is the last one.",8,0,3,28 October 2013
The Hateful Eight," Expensive western B-movie-avoid it!
","I believe that there are some good QT movies out there, for example 'Jackie Brown', but this is not it. Tarantino makes his movies in the style of the 70's. Too colorful, too vulgar, too brutal and too bloody and at some point it becomes boring. This movie suffers from same illness. Tarantino, who is known for his quick and memorable dialogues has lost his touch. In this movie, there is not a single memorable scene. Everything happens in snail-speed and he even uses slow-motion technique in some scenes, without any need. Perhaps he wanted to bring the speed of the movie to a grass-growing-speed, I don't know or care. I just wanted to express my feelings about this schlock.",2,15,30,8 March 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Excellent sequel with many interesting action sequences
","First installment of CA was a very ordinary movie. Thin plot and some generic action scenes. But this time we have something bigger with just a few plot holes. At the beginning of the movie we see Captain in a rescue mission on a ship and all the action scenes look fresh and well thought out. Main story of the movie in interwoven with the events in the series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and it is a nice move from the producers. As for the story I have one objection. The main enemy of Shield, Naci-organization Hydra wants to impose their world view on the USA. They realized that in the WW2 they failed because they tried to do this by force. This time they want to persuade the Americans to do that for them out of free choice. All good but why then did they try to eliminate hundreds of thousands of Americans to achieve that goal? They made the same mistake they tried to avoid, but blame it on Hollywood. Lately, there are many movies with some major plot holes. As for Captains opponent, the Winter Soldier, we have some real nemesis for our captain and hopefully we will see him in the future also. All in all, a solid action/sci fi movie. You will not be bored.",8,0,1,29 September 2014
Interstellar," Too much hype, typical for a Christopher Nolan movie
","As a sci-fi fan I must say that I expected more from this movie but as usual the hype was too strong, and it still is, considering the IMDb votes. Some movie critics compared this movie with 2001: Odysee in Space, but it is not so remarkable. I will not say much about the story but there are some classic sci-fi motifs incorporated into it, like themes of dying Earth, exploration of deep space and the ways to do it with simple rockets, wormholes, time-dilatation, time-travel and some humanocentric ending. All these sci-fi (or science) concepts are for themselves fascinating and tantalizing, but the overall result of the movie is underwhelming. It's hard to pinpoint what went wrong, but some ingredient in the movie is missing. Perhaps it was all too much at the same time. On the bright side, the human element of the story is nicely done and we see how much of a sacrifice exploration and distance, both in space and in time, can be. Many things were obvious in the movie, for example betrayal of dr.Mann, and perhaps it should have been done in some different manner. And of course, it is not clear (at least not to me) how and why data from the inside of the black hole helped Humanity to survive doomed Earth. So, all in all we have some mediocre sci-fi movie pretending to have some hard physics in it. Sometimes it is exciting, and at the times it is boring. If you want to see Matthew McConaughey in an excellent sci-fi movie, go see Contact.",7,0,2,18 November 2014
Nightcrawler," Boring and predictable
","Fooled by the hype, once again. I went to see this movie with high expectations, some movie critics even called it the most complete movie of a year' (whatever that means). And boyoboy, I was disappointed in the extreme. To be honest, the photography of the movie is captivating at times and the acting is OK, but the story itself is naive and hard to believe. Our hero' is a sociopathic thief who is trying to find a career for himself. He went to some help yourself' seminars and quotes motivational slogans half the time he speaks. He discovers the world of nightcrawlers, who film scenes of car accidents and crimes and sell the footage to the highest bidder. First of all, I can't believe that the TV-stations in the USA are ready to pay so much money for gore. I say so much money because our main-guy (I can't call him even a hero') in a very short time buys some cool racing-car and listening equipment, which is probably worth tens of thousands of dollars. So, to make the long story short, he manages to record a crime in real time, hides some evidence from the police, finds the perpetrators of that crime by himself, and stages a confrontation between the bandits and the police in a place with the possible highest victims-count. Before that, he manages to remove (maybe kill?) his competition by sabotaging their van. He then records the bloodbath with the police, send his partner into death, records everything, gives the police some half-a..ed excuse and gets away with it. And of course he expands his filming business and live happily ever after. If you miss this movie, you won't regret it.",1,37,96,6 February 2015
Oblivion," Predictable Sci-Fi
","My expectations for this movie were not very high but it was a solid piece of entertainment. Tom Cruise obviously loves sci-fi and he apparently found himself in this movie genre. He had strong Co-Star in this movie – Morgan Freeman – who would compel the audience even if he only read stock market bulletin. The photography in the movie is beautiful, the Earth never looked better in ruins, and female co-stars are also nice. And the audience have one or two surprises for them. But the weak point of the movie is it's predictability. Not only for the hard-core sci-fi fans. The plot is as follows: There was an extraterrestrial invasion. Enemy first destroyed the Moon and as a consequence there were massive natural disasters on Earth. Earth did fight back, launched it's nuclear weapons and defeated the enemy. The planet itself was ravaged and the remaining aliens fled into hiding on Earth. The remnant human population built an enormous base/spaceship – the Tet and they want to collect all the water from Earth and travel to Saturns moon Titan. Tom Cruise is Jack, the last mechanic on the planet and his job is to repair the combat drones which protect gigantic water collectors for the trip to Titan. He has a partner/lover – Victoria. And they live in a sterile flight control tower. And every now and then they have their minds wiped – for security reasons and Jack has strange recurring dreams/memories. Of course, everything looks suspicious from the beginning. The Tet itself looks incredibly non-human-made, especially when we see that the entire civilization lies in ruins. The great plan of the humanity – to move to Titan is beyond comprehension. What in the world could the mankind find there!? If they said Mars, maybe I would believed it. The communication with the Tet is also strange, main controller looks like an automaton. And of course the sterile environment in which Jack and Victoria live is also inhuman. No trace of individuality, but that at least has a logical explanation. We soon see that the war still goes on and that the humanity lives now underground, hiding from killer-drones, which Jack repairs. They have a plan – straight from Independence Day' – to plant a nuclear device inside the Tet. And they succeed, of course. There are some surprising subplots which I will not reveal here. And sadly, in the end, very little is revealed about the alien invader, it's origin or motivation, but never mind. Whatever the explanation might be, we (the audience) have already seen it somewhere.",7,1,3,17 April 2013
Man of Steel," Explosive action but with many plot holes
","As usual the hype for the Man of Steel like for all other Summer blockbusters was very great and to be honest my expectations were high so I looked forward to see this movie, but it disappoints on several levels. First of all, there was a serious mistake concerning the movie trailers and the last one before the movie had its premiere explained almost the entire movie. They put everything worth mentioning about the movie in a single 2-minute trailer. That was very bad decision from the movie distributors and there were moments during the screening that I felt like I watch an extended movie trailer. As for the movie itself I must admit I liked Henry Cavill as Kal-El. He really looks super and he probably never left the gym in the last two years but it paid off. As for the rest of the crew, Amy Adams was probably a miscast as Lois Lane. She does have interesting screen presence as the curious journalist but there is no chemistry between her and Clark and it is not clear why he should fall for her. Michael Shannon is very varying in his portrayal as general Zod. In some scenes he is a rational soldier and in some a lunatic and fanatic ready to commit genocide, and it feels like the actor is uncomfortable in this role. A more consistent approach could have been better. And there are some bigger inconsistencies in the portrayal of some characters, for example Kevin Costners Jonathan Kent. In the movie as in the trailer he said to Clark that he maybe should have let his school friends die in order to protect his superpowers. Real Jonathan Kent would NEVER said that. He raised Clark with a very straightforward moral and integrity and Supermans main character trait is that he is more humane then the humans, but in this movie it is not so. He even kills his opponent in the end. Some other things in the movie are left unexplained. In the beginning Jor-EL steals a kryptonian Kodex and his wife helps him with it but when the government reinstated itself after Zod's rebellion, she is not put to trial. I had the impression that tampering with this Kodex is a serious crime on Krypton, but who knows? Then Clark manages to find a spaceship from his home-world frozen in ice for thousands of years, but I have no idea how he managed that. But the positive thing is that they avoided Michael Bays mistakes from the Transformers movies. His obsession with the US military is annoying and in his movies they are able to attack and destroy some alien robots which are thousands of years more advanced then Earth. The idea itself that some Earth Army is capable to counter an attack from a space-faring aliens is so stupid and illogical there is no need to explain it further. But in this movie we see that the Earths forces are incapable to defend themselves against the aliens, which is more realistic depiction. The battle between Superman and Zod's forces is spectacular, although it is strange to see Superman hurl his enemies into the buildings where people live and he probably killed hundreds if not more. And the final battle between him and Zod is reminiscent of the final battle between Neo and agent Smith in Matrix 3, but it's OK. All in all this movie was fun, but forgettable.",7,1,2,1 July 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Could have been a lot better
","Sadly, it is not a comedy or a drama. And also sadly it is a very predictable movie. I was waiting a long time to see it and I am disappointed. These is not a single laugh to have and none of the story strands has been explored deep. We have different threads like mental illness, family problems, obsession, romance, lies and manipulations, broken girl, football and dancing and also two likable central characters but unfortunately the director misses his chance to delve into these opportunities. In short the story goes: Guy (Pat) leaves mental institution – he is still obsessed with his ex wife (Nikki) – girl Tiffany (also with mental problems) enters his life – she makes a scheme to be with him and win his heart and body – they dance together – happy end. Many of the motivations for characters in the movie are hazy at the best. In the movie we see that Pats mother helped Tiffany to be with his son but it is hard to comprehend why. Tiffany is well known in the entire neighborhood as a slut (maybe with a heart of gold, but whatever) and I don't think there is a mother who would like to have such a girl with her son. Especially when her son has mental problems. But that is not the only thing. We have therapy sessions' with psychiatrist dr. Patel which are devoid of any therapy or insight or dialogue. We have football sessions with Pat's father (Robert de Niro) but we don't see a father – son relationship between him and Pat. We have dance sessions with a super-hot Tiffany but not much dancing is shown. Or passion. We have Pat's aggression problem but it's not much in this movie. It seems that the director took a little bit of everything and put it all together. All in all, a missed chance, watch it if you must. I give it 5 stars because between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence there is without doubt chemistry.",5,1,4,23 January 2013
Divergent," Not so great, but fun
","Another movie in the genre of Young Adult Fiction. I haven't read a book, because to be honest, most of these books are written around the same idea: rebellion of the youth coming of age against some form of totalitarian society (read: society of the adults). It is clear why these ideas are so appealing to the teenagers, it is in their nature to be rebellious. We also have obligatory love story, and that's it. Divergent did not blow me away with it's story, but it's far away from awful. The premise is interesting. In some unspecified future we see residents of post-apocalyptic Chicago living within five categories (factions) of people (Abnegation the selfless, Amity the peaceful, Candor the honest, Dauntless the brave, and Erudite the intelligent), according to their character traits. But there are also the Divergent, people without faction, who live outside of society like Untouchlable caste in India. Each 16-year-old person must choose his/her faction and remain there for the rest of life. Our heroine chooses military faction (because they are soooo cool - and irritating) and we see her complete her combat training only to face great conspiracy between leaders of Dauntless and Erudite to seize the power for themselves. She manages to foil this plot and escapes with her friends. What happens now, we will see in an obligatory sequels. My main criticism is the portrayal of the Dauntless faction-army and police force of the city. They are shown as crazy, brave, tattooed, sexy youth and no wonder that they are so appealing to our heroine and young audience. They always run, jump, do dangerous stuff and so on. But even though one of the faction commanders says they train soldiers and not rebels, I wonder. They learn how to fight, of course, and most of the time they look like a bunch of brigands. They repeat the mantra faction before blood', and not once in the movie I see their loyalty to the society they are bound to protect (against what, remains to be seen). Honestly, they look as coup d'état-in-waiting, but whatever. All in all, not great, not bad.",6,1,1,4 August 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," Underwhelming villain
","I was reluctant to see this reboot of Spiderman because I felt it was too early for that, Sam Raimi made his Spiderman movies 2002-2007. I thought of it as a reboot of a reboot and to be honest I didn't like Raimis movies that much. Only thing I liked there was James Francos Harry Osborn in part 2. This time we have a new Spiderman and I must say this time he is more similar to the Spidey from the comics, I always liked his funny one-liners. As for the casting for Peter Parker I'm not sure if Andrew Garfield was best choice but I don't who could have been better, I can only say that something is missing. As for the villain, he is pretty underwhelming, but that it is understandable because his main opponents from the villain-pantheon have been already been used in the last iterations of the movies. Dr.Connors lizard is too similar to the Abomination from The Hulk reboot with Edward Norton and the fight between him and Spiderman is nothing spectacular, brute force against agility, been there-done that. There are also some illogical things in the movie, for example Gwen Stacy (super-hot Emma Stone) is at the same time in the high-school and in ultra-modern high technology company Oscorp. And people say that American education system is bad. And we also have stupid scene when Peter visits Oscorp for the first time. When Dr.Connors asks the students what is the nature of his research, they don't have a clue, only Peter knows the answer and he read it in the internet!!! I thought that those students love science and know at least something, but alas they have no idea. It is directors way to present Peter as more intelligent. All in all, entertaining but forgettable movie, no more than that.",6,0,1,17 January 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Splendid finale for the X-Man (and possibly a base for many sequels:))
","X-Men - Days of the Future Past excels in every aspect. It has a clever story (which is a hard thing to do in a time-travel movie), superb action and suspense. Basicaly it is a mixture between the Terminator and Matrix, our heroes try to manipulate the past in order to achieve some better future for the almost-extinct mutants and the oppressed mankind. And the future is grim indeed, and visually fascinating. The mutants have been hunted down because Homo Sapiens in its fight for survival in the evolutionary process managed to create super-robots which are able to confront superpowers. The battle scenes between the Sentinels (robots programmed to hunt down mutants) and the remaining X-Men are stunning. X-Men are facing a lost cause and that way we have some real suspense on the screen. In every battle before, ordinary humans have been only a cannon fodder, but with the sentinels all bets are off. As for the time travel story, our remaining heroes sent Wolwerines conscience in his young body to try to prevent the creation of super robots and perhaps to save a soul of the shape-shifting mutant Raven/Mystique. The story background in the seventies is very cool and of course it is a good thing that we have some different languages in the movie. I always found irritating that in the most movies we don't hear foreign languages, but have bad English with a foreign accent. Nacis are best example for that. This time everything fits together and as a result we have excellent movie. And it is always a pleasure to see Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen share a screen, this time as allies. Go and see it, you will not regret it.",9,4,6,29 September 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Mostly filler
","To be honest I did not expect much from this movie. It was clear to me from the beginning that The Hobbit' is too short a book to be made into three separate movies. And it shows. Not much happens in Desolation of Smaug'. Our heroes meet some elves, among them our hero from LOTR, Legolas who is at this time of his life very different character but that's OK. Then our hero fight some orks, some spiders and finally reach the Lake City which I must say is nicely thought out, we didn't have this kind of architecture or culture in LOTR. There we have the exact scene from The Fellowship' when a female elf saves our dwarfish hero from certain death from a poisonous Morgul-arrow. Then they go to the Lonely Mountain where they fight Smaug, but are unable to defeat him. He escapes and flies to the Lake City in order to destroy it. That's about it. Hopefully the third installment of the series will be better then this, but who knows? The movie is not a complete waste of time but unfortunately all that happens, all the sound and fury in the end doesn't signifies anything.",4,6,9,7 January 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Like seeing old friends
","Before I went to the cinema I heard some negative reviews and opinions on this movie so I expected three hours of boredom but fortunately I was wrong. There are of course some things that deserve criticism when it comes to battles in which our heroes kill hundreds of enemies without a scratch but that is no different from LOTR and some slapstick humour, and it is a young adults story so it's OK. I know some viewers expected realistic battles without character shields, like in Game of Thrones' but The Hobbit' was written in some other time. First of all this is a feel-good movie. It was nice to see some characters from LOTR and as before the photography and scenery is beautiful. In this movie the focus is on the dwarfs, the race we have seen too little of in LOTR. And at first glance they did not seem interesting enough to explore them more deeply, but in this movie we have tragic story of dwarfs of Erebor who now live homeless in exile and dream to return to their home which has been taken over by a vicious dragon Smaug, a foe against whom there is no defense. This movie is about their quest to reclaim Erebor. There are some moments in the movie which seemed cringeworthy like dwarf songs but it is after all a part of their character and after you hear Under the Misty Mountain cold' you will feel how tragic and sad their are. Another point which is to be criticized is some misplaced slapstick humour concerning Trolls. They are shown like the three Stooges and frankly I never thought of them so. They are slow-minded and stupid but very dangerous in battle as we have seen in LOTR. And the Goblin King is ridiculous. He is to eloquent for his lot and not threatening at all. And he also dies stupidly. We also have a new wizard – Radagast the Brown – who is shown wonderfully eccentric. The battles are dynamic and cool but suffer from old movie clichés like character shield', almost lethal weapons', hero killer', conservation of ninjutsu', suspension of disbelief', made of iron' etc. When the main character (in this case Thorin Oakenshield) believes that his main antagonist is dead we know he is wrong, and the hero is almost invulnerable except when he meets his main enemy (in this case Azog the Defiler). But this things aside, it is fun to watch goblins being killed by hundreds . The scene with Gollum was fun but I don't think we will be seeing him in a sequel. It was cool to see Saruman as good guy in the meeting in Rivendel with Galadriel and Elrond. We see some hints to his ignorance which will be his doom in LOTR. And of course, we have the Necromancer storyline, which will hopefully be explored deeper then in the book. All in all, it is a fun movie and you will be surprised by how quickly it ends.",9,5,16,21 December 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Not an exciting movie
","The hardest thing to review is a mediocre movie. Horrible and excellent movies are easy, because the motivation for a review is high. But with modest movies there is nothing special to say about them. It is possible too see them once in a lifetime and forget them immediately. I had some high hopes about this installment of Spiderman and it failed to meet them. The movie itself is in my opinion too long and most of that time was wasted as a filler. There were many new things introduced in the movie but everything seemed rushed and uninspired. We have two new villains, Electro and Green Goblin. The birth of Electro is somewhat funny, because he was bitten by radioactive electric eel (Not radioactive spider, mind you! Eel!). He hates Spiderman, because he used to love him and he got disappointed later. Green Goblin is born when Harry Osborne injects himself with some kind of radioactive spider poison. And we see him on screen for entire five minutes. Spiderman manages to defeat his enemies at the end after a bombastic fight full sound and fury, but at great price. Then we have setting for a new villains in the future, Black Cat and Rhino which seemed ever more rushed then the first two villains (especially Rhino, it's unbelievable how did they introduced him in the end)and we will see what will happen with them in future movies. All in all, a generic uninspired superhero story, more like a prequel for some future blockbusters. Go see it, you will lose only 140 minutes of your life. And you will gain not much.",5,12,25,8 May 2014
Elysium," Basically an action movie
","I didn't have big expectations from this movie when I went to see it. First of all I don't understand so much hype about movie directors last movie District 9. In my opinion, it was a simple and illogical action movie. But this is now, we have new movie with plot holes. The plot for this movie is simple enough and reminds of a cyberpunk movie Johhny Mnemonic' with Keanu Reaves. We have some classical dystopian setting which could have been explained better. Basically, Earth is overpopulated and it appears that national governments have failed, but we don't know how or why. All the rich people live on a clean space station/habitat called Elysium orbiting Earth and of course sometimes the poor try to reach this promised country with some illegal shuttles, which reminds of the boat-people who try to reach today's Europe from Africa or USA from Cuba. These shuttles are being routinely shot down from Earth by Elysium assassins. The protagonist of the movie is Matt Damon (as Max de Costa) who is lucky to have a job in a economically struggling robot factory in L.A. These robots are very sophisticated and put to use as police and soldiers and it is not clear why is necessary to have human workers assemble these robots. The owner of the factory complains about dropping productivity and he never tried full production-automatisation. But that is just the beginning. Matts character gets irradiated in the factory (it is never explained why the robots he assembles need a radiation treatment) and he will die in 5 days unless he is treated in some medical bay on Elysium which can cure every disease. As an act of a desperate man he agrees to kidnap factory owner (who is a citizen of Elysium)and steal access codes for his accounts and everything else from his cerebral implants. For this he is equipped with some cyber-exoskeleton and then the movie forgets that he is irradiated and that anybody who touches him will get some radiation from him. The heist goes awry and he is hunted by some south-African mercenaries who work as agents/hit squad for Elysium (it is never explained how is this possible in L.A. – USA). Max does not know that the information he downloaded in the heist which he keeps in his head is an access code for the entire Elysium. Then there is Jodie Fosters character who wants this code for herself so she can rule on the space station. We then have Max's childhood friend Frey and her ill daughter who are accidentally in the middle of the struggle. There was a possibility for some love story strand of the plot but it was probably dropped and instead we have some shooting and killing and shaky camera movement, typical for a modern action movie. And there are some other plot holes. For example, we see in the movie that Elysium is capable to create no-fly zones wherever they want, if so why they allow those illegal shuttles to reach them? Later in the movie we see that some shuttles can come through the defenses of the station without problems. At the beginning of the movie we see a mercenary use a shoulder launched missile on Earth to shoot down a shuttle in space which is thousands of Kilometers away which is very unrealistic, modern technology or not. At some point Jodie Fosters character is wounded and she didn't want Frey who is a doctor to help her, who knows why. Anyway we have some predictable ending of the movie and the humanity lived happily ever after. Redeeming point of the movie is that it never gets really boring. And it is not too long.",6,1,2,29 August 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Forgettable movie
","Having seen this movie I can't say that it is terrible, but it is not good either. It's rather dull. I never read the books but I have seen the entire saga in cinema, although I am not a fan. I wanted to make review for the entire movie series but to be honest, I don't remember what happened before. This movie suffers from lack of excitement. I don't know why, but there is not a single exciting scene in this movie. The actors have managed not to show any real emotion and everything they say sounds hollow, like ordinary script-reading. We have some bad guys in black who could have been frightening for what they represent but they are also boring. But for me, the main problem in this movie (and the rest of saga) is the image of vampires. There are many, many stories about vampires and, of course, there has been some alterations regarding their powers. Some turn into bats, some not. Some are sexy, some frightening, some both. Some have mind-control power. Some are killed with wooden stakes or holy water or whatever. But they are Always nocturnal creatures. They are afraid of the sun and die from it. In this version we have vampires who glitter in the sun without dying. But whatever. It is a young adults fantasy and the main goal has been achieved: the books and the movies earned money. And the movie itself has been nominated for Golden Raspberry Award 2012 in 11 categories, which also means something. So, watch this movie and the rest of the saga if you are a fan, a movie critic or a filmoholic (or film-addict).",3,6,13,11 January 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Excellent and funny movie
","I hoped this would be solid movie and I was not wrong. It is based on a Japanese novel which explains fresh approach in the time-travel concept. The premise of the movie is simple: Earth has been invaded by some alien life-form (called Mimics and remind of sentinels form Matrix) and the Humanity is losing. Almost all of Europe has been conquered and the United Defence Forces are preparing one final big offensive, something like landing in Normandy to reclaim European mainland. Our main protagonist, William Cole played by Tom Cruise, is some kind of military journalist/PR expert who is send to be embedded reporter in the front line. Being a complete coward, he tries to avoid being sent into the combat force but he gets arrested and forcefully drafted. The invasion itself is a total disaster and our hero' dies within minutes. But before he dies, he accidentally manages to kill alien alpha soldier, which obviously has some kind of special ability, because he wakes up a day before the invasion and repeats the same day over and over. On the battlefield he meets a Hero of human forces Sgt.Rita Vrataski (played by Emily Blunt), the woman who managed to defeat the aliens in one battle and she recognizes what happened to him. The Mimics have a power to rewind time each time when some alpha soldier is killed, and after a contact with one Cole has acquired this ability. Rita had this power before, but she lost it after her winning battle. She wants to use Coles ability to train him so that they will be able to find Omega-alien, mind which controls the entire invasion. Training is brutal and difficult, because our protagonist is really not a soldier and we see why he doesn't want to go into battle. He dies time and again, many time funnily. He tries to reach that alien over-mind and at the same time to save Vrataski from a certain death, which is – as it seems – an impossible mission (no pun intended). The chemistry between Cole and Vrataski is superb, and never feels forced. Luckily, the director has chosen not to overdo the romantic relation between our heroes, everything is hinted at. The ending of the movie is somewhat weaker and not logical, but that's OK, it's a time-travel story and it's difficult to avoid paradoxes.",9,10,14,19 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Nice view behind the scenes in the world of business
","This movie is known for its many swear words and nudity, but rest assured it is all with a purpose. It is based on an autobiography of Jordan Belfort (played by excellent Di Caprio), stock market manipulator. I will not elaborate much of the story because it is simple, a story of a self made man from his humble beginnings to his downfall, after some criminal activity, of course. The movie gives splendid presentation of how things work in today's economy and stock market exchange. It is a worrisome and at the same time funny business when you see that many people who rule the economy world are primitive, greedy, lying, manipulative, sinful people with short tempers. They apparently try to enjoy everything life has to offer, without limits. They enjoy drugs on regular basis, alcohol and all kinds of sex. In short, they are in all aspects priests of hedonism. Wherever you have success and money, the face under the make-up is ugly. But the most important scene in the movie, which recapitulates the whole thing, is with Di Caprio and Matthew McConaughey at the beginning where things are explained in short. Everything is a game without any meaning. The only goal is to make naive people give your their money and in exchange they receive the illusion that this money exists somewhere multiplied many times. As long they feel rich, they are rich. When they try to cash this money, the moment has arrived to deliver them from their illusion. Go see the movie, it will be informative and you will not regret it.",9,5,8,19 June 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Boring
","I can't believe that I just wrote that this movie is boring but sadly it is the truth. Not a single unexpected thing happens in this installment of a beloved book. Heroes die heroically, villains die like vermin. Or like Germans in Brad Pitt's Fury'. The only exciting scene worth watching is a fight between Sauron and Galadriel, Elrond ans Saruman. Everything that comes after is boring to the extreme. The biggest problem with all this battles of five armies is the lack of a true antagonist. I mean, we all know that the Orcs die like flies, so they are unable to create a true threat for our heroes. The dialogues are shallow an to be honest everything looks like a watered-down version of LOTR. Unfortunately this is a movie not worth a second viewing.",2,7,14,26 February 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Interesting viewing
","This film reminds me of Synecdoche, New York' starring the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. This time we see a process of making a theatre play with all up's and down's of all involved. It is also a look behind the curtain where all the glamour of the stage is revealed as a stressful and repetitive process where the actors sometimes go insane. I will not elaborate much about the story of the movie, many of the scenes have been shot in one take which is a proof for a masterful director. The cast is very strong and Michael Keaton proved he is a serious actor just like his alter ego on the screen. The only weak link in the movie is ending which seemed strange to me, because I do not understand why Birdmans delusions are being present in his daughter. All in all a strong movie, but perhaps not an Oscar material.",8,3,11,26 February 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Not great but solid entertainment
","Having seen this newest installment of Nolans Batman Series I must say it is a hit-and-miss scenario. The hype for the movie was as always too big and it appears that mister Nolan has the most loyal audience who glorify his work. As for the movie itself, I must say the main antagonist is not scary at all even though he represents definite threat for our hero and Gotham City as well, but all Batmans foes are threat for the entire City. His motivations are not clear and his plans for the citizens of the City are fuzzy (Jokers plan from TDK is far scarier, forcing people to become more like him). He has no memorable lines and his diatribes about 'giving the city to its people' while setting free worst criminals from the prison is beyond comprehension unless he means it as a cynical joke, but you can never tell. Bane's voice is very strange indeed and left me confused. It was like seeing Darth Vader speaks in a voice of Mickey Mouse. It was definitely not him. And as for his henchmen, it is beyond comprehension why are they so loyal to him. They are ready to die without question like they are dying for some great cause, but that is not so. Bane's cause is nothing but a destruction of a single city. As for Catwoman, I liked Anne Hathaway in that role. She showed she can act and change from shy to nasty in a second, and she is convincing as thug-beating-cat-burglar. Her main motivation for following Bane is fear (i believe) but it is never shown what caused it. She tries to start anew so that at least explains her change of spirit at the end. We see in this movie older and weaker version of Batman but it makes no sense to see him a mentally and physically broken man if he really retired after the episode with Two-face (or Half-face, to be correct). What happened in these eight years is also never shown. But his return as a crime fighter (the scene in the tunnels) is awesome. Police Officer Blake was welcome addition to the movie. At first he looked superficial but the character is really someone who we can imagine as Batmans heir. But not Batman. Bruce Wayne thinks that anyone can be Batman, but that is impossible. He was trained as a ninja and although John (Robin) Blake can kick some criminals a..ess he is no ninja. And no Batman. But still... All in all we have satisfying conclusion of Batmans battle for his City. Some parts of the movie are too long and implausible like Banes occupation of Gotham, but it's a superhero movie after all, it does not have to be always realistic or plausible. Enjoy!",7,3,7,30 July 2012
Thor: The Dark World," Forgetabble movie, just like part 1
","I watched part one some years ago and I didn't remember a thing until I was reminded in this movie. I forgot the characters and the story, I only remember that there was some kind of battle with some ancient enemy. Just like in Thor: TDW. We also have some ancient powerful' enemy which has been defeated aeons ago, when he tried to take over control of the universe, or something like that. Now this enemy is back along with some kind of super-weapon. And our heroes evil brother Loki is also present and continues with his schemes and tricks. Our hero is - as before - invincible and in the end we have big battle on Earth and on the plant of Who-cares-heim. The powerful (read boring and forgettable) enemy is defeated and in the end of the movie we some some hints for things to come in planned sequels. Nothing new. But, I must confess that Thor is a likable hero so there are some laughs in this installment. See it if you must.",4,7,11,10 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Missed Opportunity
","First of all I must say that I knew than JJ Abrams can't pull this thing off. His storytelling abilities were always– at least to me –insuffcient. Just look at LOST' and the last installment of Star Trek'. Nobody knows what happened with those stories and neither deserves a second viewing. He is capable to throw in some cool stuff in his movies but he was always unable to dramaturgicaly develop a story and finalize it in a satisfactory manner. And the hype from his fans is mostly damaging for the movie. The same applies for SWTFA. I remember some guy on YT with a T-shirt with a logo In J.J. we trust'. Well, that trust was misplaced. But where to begin? First of all, the biggest issue with this movie is that if you have seen all the trailers you wont have to see the movie. Honestly, there is just a single scene in the movie that wasn't shown in the trailers. The rest is well known. It is sad, because many fans thought that JJ decided to limit the trailers to predictable stuff. But that was all there is. The entire movie. Second thing. The hype, which began some time ago was about the fact that there are not much CGI effects and characters in the movie. But – imagine! – the supreme leader of Nord Kor... I mean First Order is humongous, bad, childish and cartoonish computer generated image in manner of Azog the Defiler form the last Hobbit-Movie. Then, of course we have nacistic imagery which is always effective to show some bad guys, but the speech from General Hitler...I mean Hux at the festive launch of the new Death Star made me laugh. It was so over the top, and a funny copy of Hitlers voice and countenance. Further, we have some under-under-under-used characters like Captain Phasma, who was so cool in the trailer with her silver armor. I thought that she will be the main opponent for some of our heroes but alas. She was captured without a fight and put into a garbage compactor (not shown on screen so maybe she did survive, who knows? Or cares.). Then we have our main bad guy-mister Kylo Ren. What a disappointment! At the beginning of the movie he is really a menacing presence with some new powers of the Dark side, but then we get to know him better and I must say I don't understand him or his motivation. Even the sulking Anakin from the prequels is better defined than this dark lord'. But he had three movies to develop' his character, maybe we will someday see why Kylo Ren became Kylo Ren. But at first sight, I have no idea how he became evil, or why, or how did the ayatollah...I mean supreme leader manage to bring him to the DSOTF. Furthermore, in this movie we have more of the same stuff from the original trilogy. A planet-destroying weapon. Again. With some Achilles-heel that our heroes might exploit. Again. Some fighter battles. Again. Everything is by-the-numbers and everything we have seen before. So dramaturgicaly it is Episode IV all over again. But on the other side, we have some likable plucky heroes (hmm...again). All in all, it could have been much better.",5,36,64,18 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Not as good as the first one
","I liked the first installment of the movie better but this one is a very solid movie. I have not read the book so I can't make a comparison but in this part we see the consequences of the actions our protagonist made in the first movie. Katniss suffers from nightmares because she was forced to take a life in the arena and she must travel all around to spread a word about greatness of Panem. And of course, she must maintain an illusion that she loves her partner Peeta. Those are tough times but it's going to get worse for our heroes. President of Panem wants them dead but before that, he would like to see their images broken. To that end he has a new gamemaster, who advises him to conduct more extreme (read more violent) measures to quell the beginning of unrest and rebellion in the 12 districts. This plan seemed, at least to me, pretty counterproductive and there is a twist at the end of the movie which I will not elaborate in detail, but which can be deducted from these actions. The setting is very different from part one, where our heroes were outcasts in the Hunger games but this time, since all the former victors of the games are again drafted to fight to the death, this makes them in some aspect allies or at least sufferers in the same situation. Katniss and Peeta now have friends among the tributes but since they are brought to the arena to die, they also have enemies. Interesting thing for me was the fact that the tributes had the opportunity to criticize their situation on TV. I thought that president Snow tries to have everything under control and this seemed a little naive to me. And there is another plot hole which I must mention. At the end of the movie Katniss escapes from the arena after she destroys a dome above her and the rebels seemed to have waited exactly that but how she knew what to do is never explained. Maybe there is some hint in the book. All in all I like Katniss and Peeta and I am looking forward to the conclusion of their struggle against Panem and president Snow.",8,1,17,3 December 2013
Looper," To quote the main character: It's messy.'
","This story was written by someone who does not comprehend even the basics of time travel problems and paradoxes. It is a mystery why this chaos received so high grades. The plot in short: mafia from the future sends their assassination targets into the present to be disposed of; in the present there are killers, so called loopers (organized by a sadist from the future) who await their targets and kill them. Before or later, the looper receives a mission to kill his future self. Some of them fail to do so. And then the chase begins. First of all, the premise is pretty stupid, to use such advanced technology for such mundane goal. In the movie they have explained, that in the future it is impossible to get rid of someone without being tracked. It is, as it seems, far easier to build a time machine then to avoid tracking technology from a collapsed society. Then we have a pretty horrifying (and illogical) scene of punishment for a failed looper. His present self is mutilated and his future self loses his limbs one by one. This is wrong, all his wounds have been inflicted in the past so they would appear all at once in the future. And it is unresolved if his present self has been killed or will they keep him alive for the next few decades without his limbs, until he is sent into the present. Then we have our hero', Joe who escapes his captors in the future, escapes his present looper-self and begins his search for a mysterious future mafia boss, the elusive Rainmaker', who in the future has killed his wife. Then begins a Terminator-rip-off'. Terminator-Joe from the future does not have exact information about Rainmaker, only his date of birth and he manages to narrow his search to only three kids he will have to kill. He eliminates two targets and of course, his past self protects the real Rainmaker, the fact that it HAS TO BE KNOWN to his future self even before his trip to the past, because it is past, no matter when the audience has find out this. Then the Terminator-Joe eliminates his entire (ex-)gang and there is a showdown between him, his present-self and the Rainmaker-Kid. The situation is resolved when the present Joe kills himself and the Terminator-Joe disappears. Which would set in motion time traveling paradox: Terminator Joe does not exist so he cant be sent into the past and all his actions would be reversed. But no, all his actions in the movie remain. The Rainmaker-kid survives and he will grow up not to be mafia boss but exemplary member of future society. The end. Oh, and this Rainmaker-kid has a Carrie-like telekinetic abilities, which has nothing to do with a plot and is complete superficial. As for the pacing of the movie, it is horrible. We begin with a bang (literary), then a movie comes to a halt and we have an hour or so pure boredom (or character development'). Then we have a final shoot out. All in all a very bad experience, caused by a fanboy-hype. If you want to see Bruce Willis travel through time, watch 12 Monkeys', a far superior movie in every sense.",1,248,436,1 October 2012
Cloud Atlas," Perfect 9
","I went to see this movie with mixed expectations. Some say this movie is deep and philosophical masterpiece while others call it boring crap. Like with many interesting movies we have here a love-it-or-hate-it scenario. As for me, I loved it. It is almost three hours long but it does not feel that way. I will not say much about the synopsis of the movie, go see it or read the book. The first premise of the movie is that everything and everyone, in past, present and future is connected in some way. In the movie we have characters with strange comet-like birthmark who move the story of the humanity forward. Perhaps we can can observe them like reincarnation of the same soul trying to redeem itself through the ages. In this concept we see that everything the humanity does, be it good or evil is a part of some great destiny and of course a single person can never grasp the whole picture. The idea is that everything is not only connected, but there is a meaning in everything and when not it leads to some hidden meaning in everything that will happen in the future. All the things in life, good or evil, life, death, pain, joy, happiness, sadness, health, sickness, birth, saving and taking lives, peace, war, love, hate, sacrifice of yourself or the others are part of the great journey of the humankind and when everything looks dire and hopeless and when evil is on the rise, there is always some overlooked grain of sand which causes the machinery of evil and it's schemes to collapse in the end. It is a comforting thought for the humankind but not for the individual and...it's a long story in the history of religions and philosophy and not meant for this movie review. In short, it is a story that will inspire many. I gave it 9 because we do not actually see where this great journey of humankind is going. Maybe toward redemption, but there is only a single individual that can redeemed him/herself in the end. As for the rest, we will see.",9,4,7,15 January 2013
