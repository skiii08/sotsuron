Scarface," Dynamic Performance by Pacino.
","Al Pacino made it unforgettable!!
Scarface is surely one of the best crime movie ever made.Al Pacino's performance as a sharp minded,angry,dangerous and powerful criminal is phenomenal.Al Pacino is playing a character which is brutal,angry,fearless and at the same time has love for his sister. Although movie is 2 hours and 50 mins long,but you will not find any dull moment in the movie.Alhough Al Pacino is playing a drug dealer but you will still like him as a person.Dialogues were excellent and there were couple of good songs in movie too.I also liked the way in which Al Pacino's character used to flirt with Michelle Pfeiffer's character.It was funny sometimes and was gentle too.This is indeed a work which belongs up there with all the 8.5 out of 10.",8,0,0,20 April 2020
Captain Phillips," Not a great one but still a good one !
","This is one of the toughest, most naked performances of Hanks' stellar career. It's sometimes painful and heart wrenching to watch. He's an Everyman, per usual, but he's not also a savior or a hero. He doesn't suddenly develop super strength and overpower the bad guys. He's just a guy in charge of a boat and its passengers.The four Somali-American first-time actors playing the pirates are a very realistic bunch. They play with wild-eyed and feral intensity, really scary. Barkhad Abdi plays their skinny foolhardy leader Muse, engaging Phillips in a deadly chess game, toe-to-toe. Faysal Ahmed plays the hot-headed Najee, who was the loose cannon of the group. Barkhad Abdirahman plays the young recruit Bilal, getting himself a baptism of fire on his first time out.When I saw the name director Paul Greengrass in the credits, I understood why the sense of tension and urgency were so well-conveyed. This was that familiar sense of excitement we felt in his previous films, like the last two Jason Bourne films or that suspenseful 9/11 drama 'United 93'. He really knows how to make military operations exciting on screen, as he did for the Army in 'Green Zone' and the Navy SEALS in this film.I have to admit I was on the verge of getting seasick with the shakiness of the camera, but luckily I held on despite the two-hour length of the film set at sea.Overall, this is a different sort of adventure drama, with a topic not too commonly tackled in a mainstream film. We hear of these events on the news, but this film brings us right in the middle of one. We will feel the tension building as the pirates were approaching. We will feel the fear when the pirates were on board. We will feel the desperation and the frustration of being trapped in the middle of the open ocean with no help immediately forthcoming. If you are up for such a realistic experience, then this film is for you.8/10 !",8,0,1,26 March 2020
The Equalizer," Denzell is one of the best actors in Hollywood
","The movie was amazing and will probably stay as one of my fav action movies ever and to make matters even better Denzel Washington is the movie and his performance in the movie was impecable and so was the main antigonist performance.The action was well layed out and sought through, although there are some scene kinda get me boring but the story and emotion put into this movie is just great and the music in this movie are amazing I even downloaded some of them on my phone so I could remember how it feels to be a badass like DenzelAnd the final fight of the movie where Denzel faces off against Marton and his gang in the super market was if not my fav scene of all time and the way Denzel finishes off Marton was just SOO BADASS and SICK, when I heard they were making a sequel I was the happiest man alive and when I watched it I had the same amazing feeling as when I watched the first one. My honest opinion would be something like 6.5 or 7/10 but I just love this movie SOO much I have to give it a 7",7,0,0,24 March 2020
127 Hours," Outstanding.
","127 Hours really changed my thought of going out exploring without telling anyone where you're going. Very inspiring, and well-directed. I will caution those who haven't seen this movie: if you are looking for a good time in watching a movie, 127 Hours is not what you should watch. It's very emotional, but you won't be getting any spoilers from me, even though this is a true story. Just don't watch it if you have a weak stomach or are prone to fainting. It's a great movie, but not for everyone to watch.",8,0,0,30 May 2020
Zodiac," David Fincher's Excellent Movie
","Zodiac is a brilliant descent into one of the most infamous unsolved murder cases in history. To all the people who've got their brains sunken into their skulls, this is a TRUE story, and as I've said the case is currently unsolved, meaning this is a story where the heroes DON'T get closure, WHICH might be the dumb reason why some people might be so salty why the killer is'int revealed in the end, do your homework kids.Okay, to get that out of the way the movie itself is one the best TRUE murder crime stories ever told. The acting alone is the biggest thing that makes this move shine. The accuracy is an other big one to, if you watch the special features you could tell that David Fincher, who yet again does a great job at directing, wanted to painstakingly recreate the murder scenes as correct as possible. An other great thing about the movie is the pacing which is crazy because of the movie's length, I've seen this movie about 5 times, and it gets better for me each time, in fact Fincher asked the actors to read their lines faster than usual to make the movie not as long as it already is.
For the people who are still not listening and don't want to listen, go watch the pretty terrible 'Awakening the Zodiac' movie, its shorter and it 'reveals' the killer in the end.",8,1,2,19 March 2020
The Godfather: Part II," Found the duality between father and son poetic.
","When I watched this movie I was amazed how Robert de Niro nailed the role of Don Vito Corleone. It could be a pressure for any actor to play a role which has previously played by a famous and good actor before and much problem to play younger Vito was that it was played by the god of cinema: Marlon Brando but Bob De niro didn't hesitate or felt under pressure for a single moment in the movie. And some times he was even better than brando himself.
Michael Corleone's life story after being the godfather was brilliant written and well played by Al Pacino. A man who tried to protect his family and get in the line of work he despised most and some where he started to enjoy it. This was the fate of Michael in this segment. From being a sad army veteran to a necerary devil but in this movie he was a satan who doesn't want to give up power and would do anything to protect his father's legacy and his crime empire.
In this movie you would also like the match cut between Vito's timeline and Michael's timeline.
A Cameo from James caan as Sonny in the end of movie was very soothing and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen was brilliant again.
Francis Ford Coppola should be given all kind of accolades for making The godfather part one and two",9,0,0,20 April 2020
Cast Away," Outstanding !!
","Tom Hanks and Wilson <3It's all about love - about the difficulty of finding it in a world obsessed with success, about the freakish accidents that can produce or destroy it, about an ordeal that led one man to re-think what is meaningful in life, and about the need to bring to the pursuit of love the same resourcefulness and courage that enabled the hero to survive on an island for 5 years.Tom Hanks is superb as Chuck Noland - creating immense sympathy for an ordinary guy trapped - not against his will - in a job that is eating him alive. How many actors could have made Noland's attachment to 'Wilson' believable? Yet Hanks does.Everything about it works, the cinematography, the locations, the acting, the story and this is Robert Zemeckis' greatest showpiece. Tom Hanks has done some bad roles over the years but this is as brilliant as any Jimmy Stewart performance captured on film. I revisit this film about once a year and find things about it that make it even better with each viewing. The story is so well written in its simplicity, and Helen Hunt and Hanks have amazing chemistry. It is a love story with action and heartbreak like few films have been able to pull together. I guarantee you will never pass a Wilson volleyball again without a big smile!",8,1,1,29 May 2020
Inside Out," This is one of the most brilliant movies I've ever seen.
","The movie inside out has a unique way to teach us about how to deal with our emotions. It is a good movie because it is cute and adorable. 'This movie is the best! It's emotional, funny, has GREAT animation and more!' (Bozdech, 2015). I think this is a movie that everyone should watch.I like it when they show Riley as a little girl and she is very happy and sassy. There is this part where Riley is running around the house and being a little sassy girl because she doesn't want to have her clothes changed. I like it because they have all these happy cute memories of Riley when she was so little and they show it at the beginning of the movie. One of Riley's cutest moments was when Riley's parents were teaching her how to play hockey on the ice and both of her parents were so happy that Riley was going to grow up playing ice hockey. Another cute moment was when Riley had an imaginary friend named Bing Bong who was pink like cotton candy and they always played together and they had a song that would start the wheelbarrow and fly into the air and they played an instrument together. Riley has a good imagination and she loves spending time with her friends and going out with them.For me, I rate this movie a 8/10 because this move is good and it is cute at the beginning and it shows you how to express your emotions. It is the best movie in the world and I recommend this movie to someone who wants to watch it to see how it is because the movie is so cute and adorable and you would cry when you watch it because some parts are emotionally good.",8,1,1,20 March 2020
Saving Private Ryan," ''There are events in history that show the dark side of humanity'' - HBO on Saving Private Ryan.
","Saving Private Ryan is an outstanding War Movie directed by Legend Steven Spielberg back in 1998 starring: Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns and Vin Diesel.It's a story about a platoon of men in US Army Ranger Battalion assigned to the search & rescue mission in Normandy France after D-Day landings (D-Day plus 3). The mission is a man. A 101st Airborne paratrooper named James Francis Ryan of Iowa who parachuted and got lost in Combat somewhere in Normandy France. From Bloody Beaches to the battered French Towns movie is just awesome.The selected group of men out on the mission to find Ryan face danger, death and destruction every minute n hour facing the Germans. Movie also depicts what men go through during Combat in Wartime. Movie highlights the brutalities and harsh realities of war and brotherhood of men during combat.Movie opens at Bloody Omaha beach Operation Overlord and ends with gruesome firefights with Germans in a small bombed out French town. Every scene is gripping from beginning to the end portraying the punishing monstrosity in battlefields of Normandy.Story - Mission is to find a missing Airborne paratrooper of 101st Airborne division 506th outfit whose brothers were KIA in combat and has been ordered to be searched by a rescue party and send him home before he is harmed amidst the chaos of war. SPR is basically inspired from the vintage classic drama movie 'The Fighting Sullivans' which is the story of 5 Sullivan brothers who fought n died against the Japanese in the Pacific.
The Movie is also inspired by 4 American Brothers who fought in the Pacific Africa Italy and Normandy.But like SPR there are many other untold stories of Normandy landings on D-Day 6th June that just need to be told. There is one moving scene in the film that touches my heart. The scene of the mother of 4 brothers who receives the telegram from the army of her 3 sons killed in combat while the other is missing in Normandy. These things happen to every family during Wartime be it any country. losing loved one's in war is painful and depressing be it a son husband or father. War is a living he'll. Who knows it more than a soldier. The world has still not learnt any lessons from WWII and evil Nazis who are a warning from history.Winds of War, War & Remembrance, Battle of Britain, Sink the Bismark, Tora Tora Tora, Pearl Harbour, From Here to Eternity, Midway, Von Ryan's Express, In Harms Way, The Longest Day, Das Boot, The Enemy Below, Schindler's List, Holocaust, Wallenberg: A heroes Story, The Diary of Anne Frank, The Sound of Music, Operation Crossbow, The Thin Red Line, Stalingrad, Enemy At The Gates, Patton, Guns of Navarone, The Great Escape are some of the other War time greats and a must watch. Most are War time action n drama period classic war films based on WWII.But no war movie in the past can match the brilliance excellence and master work of legendary Hollywood Director Steven Spielberg. Movie won Oscar for best Cinematography. This is the best WWII action War movie ever made by Hollywood. Opening scary combat scenes in Omaha Beach are terrible and bloody. MG-42, 34 roar with heavy MG fire, mortar artillery shell explosions along-with brutal gory war scenes.After watching the movie SPR my eyes were full of tears and i was moved. War is hell and civilians don't realize what men and women in uniform go through. Since WWII many War Veterans in America suffer from PTSD.My suggestion to all is to view - Band of Brothers HBO 10 part TV miniseries which is another true WWII war story of 101st US Airborne Div. Based on the true story of Lt. Richard Winters and his men. It's a true war story just like The Pacific HBO Miniseries 2010.",9,0,0,21 March 2020
The Illusionist," Great movie highly recommended.
",One of my all time favorites. A beautiful period piece. Stunning actors able to take you to another time and place. Can watch this and it never looses it's appeal. Totally missed by the viewing public.,7,0,0,21 March 2020
Coco," Best Animation Movie
","Though being similar in concept with a movie that deals with dia de los Muertos( day of the dead), yes... I am talking about The Book of Life which released 5 years back.This pixar heart touching musical outruns the former in quality and quantity. We can easily call coco the best animation movie of this decade that touches the heart of not just kids but also adults.
The animation is top notch. The entire Mexican culture is explained beautifully. Even if you are not a Mexican.You can easily relate to these Mexicans. And trust me. After this beautiful movie ends, you will try to mimic these people and their accent.
Talking about the story, it is completely different from the brainless entertainers made these days. Coco talks about family, sacrifice, love, passion and of course, the journey of a 12 year boy to follow his dream. This is that film which will bring tears in your eyes if you are a very emotional person, i dont generally cry in movies but this one made me cry towards the end, had tears in both my eyes and also a handkerchief by my side. Once you are done crying, it will bring a wide smile on your face when the end credits start rolling.
If you are by chance a big disney fan or a lover of animation movies, then don't give this a miss.Watch it once in your life.",9,0,0,17 March 2020
1917," What is depicted onscreen is a work of art than a delineation of war
","Sam Mendes' 1917 is a visual war poetry, both ambitious in scope and grandeur in scale where two Birdmen try to Save sixteen hundred Private Ryans and Corporal Blakes.The plot sounds like the 'saving the world' journey of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee of the Shire from the Fellowship of the Ring, particularly from its end where they are left by Aragon to be on their own to the Return of the King through the lifeless no-man land, perpetual trenches, ghastly rapid rivers and bone-chilling grotesque remnants of the war. Though the comparison to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan is inevitable, the scene involving the German fighter pilot, might feel less original as it borrows elements of character arc straightaway.For utmost every ebb and flow, writing commemorates this epic voyage of Blake and Schofield, realistically played by both actors portraying these roles. Before every major obstacle/storm, there is some room for calmness where these characters come across something evocative so they get to have a brief chat about them which for most parts is likeable or at least, puts the morale of a soldier before us.Roger Deakins' cinematography is heralded as one of the greatest of all time, which in fact is true, can still be put in an infamous, not well-known debate. There are numerous 360Â° panning shots in open fields and tracking shots within trenches, which might leave an audience disoriented as L.A.Times critic Justin Chang states in his review. Yet the greatness vastly outsmarts this negligible irritation.There are two particular sequences in the film, that can easily be considered as two of the greatest cinematic moments of the decade. Thanks to the gut-wrenching score (sixteen hundred man) of Thomas Newman, the light men and the production designers!In the end, staging like how the story unwraps under the trunk of a tree and winds up on a similar note, is what makes this cinema, an art-house and not just another blockbuster entertainment.",8,0,2,26 January 2020
Prisoners," One of the most chilling thriller movies I have ever seen.
","'Prisoners' is rich in compelling narratives and stellar performances from the ensemble cast. This movie had me love and hate Hugh Jackman's character which was so complex to the point of making me question my moral standards because I found myself empathizing with his character. On the other hand, Jake Gyllenhaal did a marvelous job on playing the frustrated cop: complete with all the intensity of his eyes and his intuition. While Gyllenhaal had more screentime as the lead, Jackman's performance really stood out for me.This film doesn't use jumpscares (often precluded by suspenseful music to build-up the tension and are often abused in this genre) in order to thrill the audience, but rather, moments of silence and stillness. Its calm and cold vibe stirs up the kind of anxiety it wants its audience to feel, and naturally, the audience would want to get rid of that uneasiness by knowing what's going on, thus, cleverly forcing them to watch the entire film which runs about 2 hrs and 33 mins.The director, Denis Villeneuve, incorporates his 'less is more' style of using soundtracks in this movie (just like what he did with Blade Runner 2049) to emphasize the scenes, especially with the ending (heavens know how much I liked that ending). It's not rocket suspense but the simplicity of it makes your mind wander to other possibilities which I think is often a good indication of a brilliant film since it's open for other interpetations.However, one thing that won't make me rate this a perfect 9 or 8 is the fact that I'm not entirely convinced on the motivation of the antagonists for doing the things they did. It felt a bit rushed (for the lack of a better word) and while it makes sense, it doesn't leave me satisfied",8,1,1,27 March 2020
Snowden," Overall
","It's a pretty good movie. As the political establishment at the time under that loon GWB used the 9/11 violent acts of jihad as a smokescreen to more than double the size of the federal government. As GWB, like his father before him, didn't have a genuine conservative bone in his freaking leftwing to the core body.As he duped the country into believing the ludicrous fairy tale that the horrible evil scourge of Islam is somehow a so-called Religion of Peace, morally equivalent to all true faith-based religions. Thus, in his fairy tale narrative, Muslims are morally equivalent to all non-Muslim unbelievers in the world and never mind the fact that Muslims have been the archenemies of all non-Muslim unbelievers in the world ever since that menace to all non-Muslim unbeliever societies first evolved approximately 1400 years ago.Hence, instead of acting swiftly to separate our two fully incompatible societies from one another completely, permanently, and forever and as common sense dictated in response to 9/11, that utterly unhinged loon, GWB, increased mass Muslim migration with all of its excess baggage and in which is really stealth demographic jihad to invade and infiltrate non-Muslim unbeliever countries in mass, by five-fold, and at the same time created the biggest federal boondoggle the world had ever seen when he created the gargantuan Department of Homeland Security to spy on all of us today.Then he declared an exceedingly fantasy-based War on Terror that was preordained and doomed to miserably fail no matter what since even before it was first launched because it was premised on the fairy-tale that the horrible evil scourge of Islam is somehow a so-called Religion of Peace, morally equivalent to all true faith-based religions.Hence, exactly like all things premise and based on a stupid stupid fairy tale, that incredibly fantasy-based so-called War on Terror has been miserably failing year after year to the tune already of over $8 trillion dollars and with no end in sight.Anyway, my biggest criticism of the movie is they could have at least found someone far better looking to play the part of Snowden's girlfriend to give us, the audience, something far better to look at during the movie.",7,0,0,11 June 2020
The Godfather: Part III," The Godfather 3 is not a terrible movie.
","This movie is by far the weakest of the 3 movies, but if you watch Godfather 1 and 2, before Godfather 3 the movie plotline for Godfather 3 will make sense. I do feel however waiting 16 years to finally finish the trilogy was bit excessive, if I had to speculate, I believe Francis Ford Coppola never intended to make a third Godfather movie, also casting his daughter Sofia as Mary, Michael Corleone's daughter was a travesty, Sofia Coppola cannot act or for that matter direct, the only reason she has gotten as far as she has is because she is Coppola's daughter. What I did really enjoy was the interaction between the character's Michael and Kate, and the evolving of Connie as a strong, capable, fierce woman who could become head of the Corleone family if she wanted to, that I enjoyed.
Overall, I did enjoy watching this film.",8,3,4,21 April 2020
Parasite," Must Watch
","I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.It's directed by Bong Joon-ho, he did Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), and now he's back with Parasite and it is fantastic. From a directing standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. The cinematography is extremely well done. It's just stunning and so metaphorical. There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat.My favourite aspect is the narrative. I love the concept that Parasite is built on and what it explores throughout the movie, with the conflict and contrast between upper and lower cIasses of society. It was just beautiful to watch it play out, with its prevalence within the lives of all the characters, along with how they overcome their difficulties and how they evolve with their circumstances.The characters and performances themselves are also amazing. The entire cast is just perfect in each of their roles and I really hope they get some recognition from the Academy. I don't think many people mentioned the character arcs but I thought that was really well constructed too.The score and sound design by Jeong Jae-il was also perfect in every scenario. It brings scenes from 100 to 1000 and emphasises each tone, emotion and atmosphere.In regards to flaws, I don't think there are any major ones with Parasite. There is one decision made in the third act that I felt could've been better explored to support it. But still it didn't really bother me.Parasite is probably my favourite movie of 2019. It's funny, thrilling, emotional, satirical and hauntingly true. It's delivers everything that makes a movie perfect and shakes you to your core.",9,20,31,16 January 2020
The Godfather," As no one can show light to the Sun as you wouldn't dare write a review for this masterpiece!
","Winner of 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather is one of the most revered movies of all time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, The Godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the Corleone family under its patriarch, Vito Corleone, a respected Mafia don nicknamed the Godfather. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter drug business, a series of events are set in motion resulting in the assassination attempt on the Don and leading his youngest son to rise and take over his father's business.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of astounding. Many of the creative decisions he made, such as the way he shoots the film, the casting, the screenplay, which he co-wrote with Mario Puzo, it's all done brilliantly. The technical aspects will also make you impressed. The cinematography is done beautifully and the use of Technicolor provides a memorable look for the film. The editing is also done well and the soundtrack by Nino Rota is one of the most memorable scores in cinema history, as its almost funeral-themed opening track still remains iconic and fits the film's overall tone.The performances in the film are amazing, as it features an amazing cast of brilliant actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan, Richard Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire and many more. I love how the film handles Michael Corleone's character arc in this film and Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is one of the greatest performances in cinema history.Honestly, there's really nothing to complain about this film, as it's highly agreed to be of the greatest films in history. The Godfather brilliantly weaves an intriguing look into the world of organized crime along with innovative storytelling, focused direction and astounding performances.",9,0,0,20 April 2020
