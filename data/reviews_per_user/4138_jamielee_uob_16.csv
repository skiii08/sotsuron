The Avengers," Avengers Assembling And Avengers Avenging
","The marvel adventure could only go one way after the dismal Captain America, and thankfully things have got better! The combination of superheroes actually seemed to work for me, and the storyline was better than I expected. Clever that they've used a villain from another world and another movie...but does leave me wondering where the next Avenger film can go from here?!The most pleasing upgrade for me is the Incredible Hulk. From Ed Norton's boring and dull portrayal of this green monster...Mark Ruffalo has transformed this beast into an integral character with all sorts of edginess that keeps the viewer hooked! Ultimately though, once again the stand out actor is Mr Downey Junior himself, who just seems to get better with every marvel film he is in! The witty lines and the persona which he displays as Iron man is a joy to behold!With the storyline needing to be a little farfetched, Marvel have done well to keep it just this side of the line of reality! Whilst recognising that something extraordinarily and extravagant would be needed to bring these superheroes together, there are times in the film that it's in slight danger of crossing that line! Still...not bad at all in my book

The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Sulk
","Hulk... no thanks....Edward Nortons portrayal of this green monster generally sums up this movie... disappointing, a lack of charisma and lack of understanding. It's already a movie which is handicapped from the origins of this 'superhero', I mean the creator of the Hulk made him green...green!!! The only green things I like are a football pitch and my shower gel...and I guarantee the Hulk isn't a great footballer and smells no where near as good as my shower gel! Whoever created the Hulk probably has no imagination and probably didn't make millions from creating other characters in the marvel universe... (awkward)From a serious point of view, there's a reason that the Hulk isn't really a popular character from the marvel universe. This movie does nothing to enhance the jolly green giants reputation, other than remind us that he can get angry from time to time. This movie also ruins the thought that us sinister movie watchers have... turns out the Hulk can't have sex, even with the wonderful Liv Tyler.. disappointing in every aspect.The storyline was weak, the only saving grace was the glimpse of what was to come. Learning to control when to switch it on and off makes Hulk more of a superhero, and the brief appearance of Tony Stark left me wanting to continue watching the Avengers story

Iron Man 3," Iron Man Free
","Once again, iron man delivers. What else can we say?! Robert gets better with each movie (although the first one is still the best) and the storyline keeps delivering. Not much else to say... comedy, action, drama...and the fact they've managed to link the events of New York to toe on well with it is an added bonus!Not the strongest iron man movie, but runs a close second...

Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2 be Continued...
","The second instalment of iron man turned out to be...let's say average! Whilst Mr Downey Jr and Mickey Rourke maintain a good level of acting, the storyline somewhat blues the essence of what Iron man is truly about...Firstly, everything cool about iron man stays relatively unique. The hot rod red and gold colours maintain his glamour, but the production of other suits means that Iron man doesn't seem as special now. Secondly, 'hammer industries' really loses the fear factor when Hammer himself is portrayed so badly by Sam Rockwell. Not so much a villain as a comedian, which is not what the doctor ordered.I'm intrigued by the marvel series after watching this, with Natalie rushman clearly the aesthetically pleasing type and the introduction of the second coolest man on the planet (Samuel L Jackson), the story is beginning to piece together.. but compared to the first movie in the iron man series, this was a little below the bar setJ Boss reviews gives 7.0/10",7,1,1,15 May 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Thorsome Ragnarok
","Thor Ragnarok... A stunning ConclusionThis is how to do a movie and mix superheroes! Whilst the only negative is the exclusion of Natalie Portman...the rest more than makes up for it. An exciting storyline which left me hooked and the action scenes were visually stunning. The mix of Thor and Hulk is a surprising plus, and works well here.The fantasy element probably does overstep the mark a little, but that's what Thor does! A mix of emotions with the ending heightens the thrill of the film...yet for all the thrilling action and epic scenery...what makes this Marvel film standout from some others is the comedy element. Not often do Marvel pull it off, especially in a film without Downey Jr, but here they have and with great effect. This compliments the storyline perfectly and adds that joyous smile to our faces!Overall, this is an epic film for me and is definitely up there with some of the better films...

Spider-Man: Homecoming," shouldn't have come home
","Spider-Man Homecoming.... but I wish he'd have stayed awayThis wasn't great was it! Spider-Man in a suit with all different gadgets...NO! Spider-Man fighting off weird men with weird science guns...NO!... the design of the costume...NO!.... Aunt May...YES!Compared to the original Spider-Man movies with Tony McGuire...this doesn't scratch the surface I'm afraid

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Winter Soldier Warms things up...
","Captain America: Winter SoldierA much better showing from the patriotic hero here...the action scenes are far superior to its predecessor l, and the whole storyline which incorporates shield more is like a giant door swinging open in the Marvel series. The masterful Samuel L Jackson is as cool as he ever is whilst maintaining a slight narcissistic yet clever image.The introduction of some bird man (I still have no idea who that is) is a good concept and adds a needed sidekick to Captain America...and the elevator scene really shows for the first time that Cap can actually be a hard man!The only thing that lets this film down for me is the idea of the winter soldier being an old friend. I get what the makers are trying to do there, but the ending needed...well the ending needed the end! The fact that he has been left alive tells me that there is more to come from this villainous man, when really he should be dead and buried!

Ant-Man," Ant-man not too bad, just crap and pointless
","I'm not going to lie..the idea of a film called Ant man was about as appealing as pooing in my hands and clapping! This low level of expectation which I took into watching this film...was surprisingly exceeded.. but not by much at allA suit that can make you very small or large is a good idea...but how on earth does a random man suddenly conman a legion of different Ants?! No no no, sorry but I can't rate this with the elite marvel films! especially when he can somehow go 'sub-atom' size whenever he wants apparently... the storyline of a villainous greedy man is common, and although it tries its best...I didn't really understand the concept of this superhero

Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America disappoints
","For supposedly being one of the main faces of the avengers series, this comic book hero movie failed in a lot of ways. Things started well when I realised this was set in the classic world war 2 times...the vintage look and feel of the scenes were perfect. Sadly, that was to be the only thing perfect. The origin of captain America isn't one I can get on board with, and neither is the red headed villain! He looked more like 'The Mask' with very bad sunburn. Whilst the action scenes were fine, and the main body of the story OK at best... the ending was a massive disappointmentSo Captain America crashes an aircraft which looks like it belongs in Star Trek, into what I thought was water, but looks more like a cloud covered ice bath?! Who knows?! And 70 years later...he wakes up?! I'm sorry, but this is a superhero born from a weak and small man...this doesn't wash with me!

Captain America: Civil War," Civil War is a civil bore
","I went into this film extremely sceptical about how they could make a superhero vs superhero and still keep alive the concept of a 'superhero'.... not only was it bad, but I was left terribly disappointed!Firstly, the idea of a superhero movie is that everyone has a hero and a villain to which they can direct their love and anger at... this is the nature of human bias! Putting superheroes against each other kills the idea of a superhero movie!Secondly, the storyline and plot conspire for me to take sides (see the human bias section), and I'm astonished by the sheer stupidity and senselessness of it!... a man who has killed people, and who has killed Iron Mans parents ends up being protected by other superheroes! Now hold on... simply no! The conclusion I drew from this is very simple...Captain America is a complete prat!Thirdly, I've had it up to here with that mind control bird. I don't know what her name is, I don't know why she exists...please can she leave my screen as she is getting on my bloody nervesActions scenes are ok, but the battles between the marvel characters don't impress me much if I'm honest...the only reason this gets a slightly higher rating than it would've done....
1. once again Downey Jr puts in a stellar performance as Iron Man who is fast becoming a cult hero for me
2. The introduction of the black panther is interesting as he seems like a cool character, hopefully the stand alone movie will be better than this oneApart from those two reasons, I won't be scurrying to watch this again anytime soon

Avengers: Infinity War," All action yet all over the place
","Avengers Infinity WarAll action but all over the place!Action packed for sure, with a storyline that kept me entertained and on the edge of my seat. All goes on in this thriller, and the action scenes throughout the film all make it intense! The battle on Wakanda makes it all the epic...There are some elements to it which make me think that it has gone a little overboard...these infinity stones and magical powers of different characters and things in space and the universe steer more toward a Star Wars theme for me, which is fine but not in these type of superhero movies!The scene with doctor strange giving the time stone to Thanos to save Iron mans life is too farfetched for me, especially considering the ending where everyone else 'died'Despite this, this all action movie did impress and was much better than the age of ultron... the mix of superheroes was, for the first time, somewhat cool and worked in this movie!

Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age of Ultron
","Avengers: Age of UltronAverage at best, with things getting more and more technologically complicated, yet a storyline which is 'ok'. Compared to the previous Avengers movie, age of Ultron is a downgrade I feel. The novelty of these superheroes coming together is completely worn off. Again, a common reoccurrence is the character of Tony Stark and Iron man pulling the cart with the rest of them on. Can't help but begin to feel that these Marvel films are heavily reliant on Downey Jr.Body forms of A.I arena interesting part of the series, but it's becoming more and more fantastical with each movie. An example is the introduction of the mind control human...that's a no from me in afraid.Overall a good attempt, but I feel that even some stand alone movies are more worthy of superheroes than this!

Thor," Thor Like a box of chocolates...
","You just don't know what part of Thor is good, and not so good. An average feel surrounds the film. Up until now the Marvel universe has kept us within the confines of Earth, but this latest foray into the other 9 realms really does leave it open to opinion....I love a fantasy type film, and if done right can be a legendary movie. I did not feel the same vibe from this movie, yet felt like saying 'ok, it was a nice try'...magical and mystical powers being condensed through a hammer isn't exactly what a superhero entails for me, but somehow fits in well with the fantasy element of the movie. Again, some of the powers of the frost men and other magical characters are too much, and as my friend Mazza would say...'over the top'The appearances and characters get a thumbs up though... seeing a Handsome blonde blue eyed muscular man reminded me of myself, and it's always nice to relate to a character like that. The appearance of Natalie Portman is always welcome, and bumps up the review rating. With Shield becoming more of a presence with each Marvel film, the general marvel storyline is coming together nicely.The back and forth yo-yo effect of the storyline can leave the watcher confused, with me thinking countless times about what actually Thor was trying to achieve, or what the bad guy was trying to achieve?! It makes sense in the end, but could've been done better. Not the worst Marvel movie, but left a little bit wanting

Black Panther," Wakanda Forever...
","Black Panther a mega hitWow...simply stunning! This was a bolt out of the blue and an exciting one at that! This is the exact beauty of a superhero movie! Mixed with an all start cast of brilliant actors and actresses...this was a hit from he moment it started!Human emotion, a little fantasy and Andy Serkis... what more could you ask for?!...nothing is the answer, but they gave us more none the less! An emotional family storyline wrapped up in historical and tribal traditions, amongst modern technological innovations and Martin Freeman...all this in one huge explosive ball of a movie that had everything...Let's start with the Vibranium...do we all want this...Yes! A metal that can virtually do anything, including the make of the coolest suit of all marvel heroes so far (along with Iron Man). Let's move on to the sheer 'cool' factor of this film! So much 'cool' in this film, that is had led to me introducing a hand shake to my good friend Mazza #WakandaforeverViewers embark on an emotional rollercoaster throughout doing a loop the loop by the second, and not once does it go to far! The ending is how a superhero movie should end! No B.S, just pure and simple! And that sums this film up...pure and simple with a magical element of beauty and street wise actors...this movie is along side the best that Marvel have produced... Wakanda forever

Iron Man," Iron man is a superhero....
","Iron ManWhen someone is a leading weapons manufacturer, a billionaire, a genius and a man who can get any girl he wants...it's hard to think what could make him cooler? A red and gold suit that flies does the trick! What I like about this movie is that there is no element of fantasy, just pure man made will and desire. No gimmicks, no magical spells or dodgy death scenes....just technological genius.A slight flaw is the obvious fact of who would turn out to be the traitor...the villain! Guessed from the moment he picked up the award....the older figure with some facial hair and no hair on top...it's always the bald ones. There's also the fact that apart from Robert Downey Jr, no one brings much to their character. But let's be honest, Downey Jr is one of the greats and shows it with his portrayal of Tony StarkJ-Boss reviews gives 9/10",9,0,1,12 May 2019
Thor: The Dark World," A dim light in a dark world...
","The best way to describe this film is....hmmmm? The plot was indecisive for me, and scrappy! It was as if there was never meant to be a sequel to Thor...but they had success in the last one so asked Stevie wonder to knit a movie together...and this was it!The action scenes were impressive as always, and the beautiful Natalie Portman is always a plus...but I can't help feel this may have just crossed the line of too much fantasy!On the other hand..certain elements of the plot did impress me. The emotional scenes of a family torn apart, and the introduction of new creatures and mythical relics seem OK to me...This really is a film which I think needs rewatching to fully grasp the elements...the cliffhanger ending is always a Hollywood classic but can't help but that was a bit farfetched...judgement on this film will be more concise once I know the true depth of what is to come
