It," IT the movie 2017 Surprisingly Good
","I took the day off today to go see one of my favorite books by Stephen King latest adaptation on the big screen. I have read this book and watched the mini-series too many times to count.I was going into it with some anxiousness knowing that Tim Curry was not going to be Pennywise but I love the story so figured I would give it a shot.I give this movie a solid B+. The cast was great, the special effects were really cool and scary. Of course as screenwriters do they took a few liberties with the story that rubbed me the wrong way at times but overall it was worth the money. My daughter enjoyed it too however she has seen the mini-series a few times and she kept whispering to me that isn't right and that isn't right.Overall, I recommend going to see it. I wish there were still drive-ins around because it would be a great drive-in movie.",8,4,10,8 September 2017
