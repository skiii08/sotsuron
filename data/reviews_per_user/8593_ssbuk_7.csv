The Devil's Advocate," An enjoyment to watch
","I appreciate this film differs slightly from the book,and normally,I prefer the book.However,Al Pacino changes all that.If you want to see an actor enjoy his work,watch this.I am taking nothing away from Keanu Reeves,but he needn't show up for this film,Al Pacino could carry it by himself.The man has the most amazing presence on screen,and I can think of no one who would play a better Devil.For those of you who have read the book,but not seen the film-The plot is roughly the same.Undefeated lawyer Kevin Lomax(Reeves) is invited to work for a top firm in New York,where he is taken under the wing of the charismatic John Milton(Pacino),who soon reveals himself in all his glory.Charlize Theron adds beauty to this film,and is 100% convincing as Reeves'loving wife.If you want to learn how to drag a potentially disastrous film to the top single-handedly...watch Al Pacino in this,who knows-you may grow to like Keanu Reeves more,for the fact he tries his best to keep up with the master.Enjoy The Film Sean",8,0,1,19 April 2006
Wayne's World," Give this movie a chance
","Most people assume Wayne's World is just stupid jokes,a weak plot,and daft characters...and they'd be almost right.That said,this is one of the funniest films I've ever seen.From the small chuckles when Robert Patrick appears as the cop from Terminator 2,to the fantastically funny 'asphinctersayswhat?'.This film has the most lovable characters,and Mike Myers and Dana Carvey deserve nothing but praise for this.The fact the cameraman is acknowledged and they refer to it as 'their movie'means people have no excuse to pick up little points they can moan about.If you have 2 hours free,which most people do at some stage.Watch this film,you'll like it,give it a chance.Enjoy The Film Sean",9,0,1,20 April 2006
Aliens," You simply cannot find a better Sci-Fi film
","I thoroughly recommend this film to every person who has not seen it.This film has everything you need from a Sci-Fi film. It has a great plot,keeping the 'Alien' concept interesting,has some amazing characters you simply have to like,and even throws in a maternal element.Set 57 years after 'Alien'.The film revolves around Ripley(Weaver)returning to LV-426,to investigate the loss of contact with colonists working at an Atmosphere Processor.This time however,Ripley goes in with a team of marines.The marines,for me,make the film. There's the sturdy,reliable,dashing Corporal Hicks(Biehn),the charismatic,Gun-Ho Private Hudson(Paxton) and the tough,fearless Private Vasquez(Goldstein).There are many more I'm not mentioning,who each deserve recognition for their role.Sigourney Weaver is once again convincing as the woman who is stuck in a situation she hates being in,but nonetheless gets on with it in order to stay alive,and even Carrie Henn deserves a mention as one of the few children on screen you WANT to live.I could go on praising this film all day,but I have to stop and let you draw your own conclusion.All I will say,is watch this film,and you'll love it.Enjoy The Film Sean",9,0,1,19 April 2006
Reservoir Dogs," Charming Criminals
","From the scene in the diner,discussing 'Like A Virgin' and tipping waiters and waitresses.You just know you are watching some different,different and better.The fact there are so few characters makes it so much easier to pick and choose who you like,which obviously,is a good thing to get that involved with a film.The film revolves around a team of strangers pulling off a diamond heist.This is where Harvey Keitel comes into his own,forget City of Industry(which I'm not knocking).This is where Harvey shows how convincing he is.Even Tim Roth,who turns out to be not what he seems,delivers another role with such deliberation it's amazing.The chemistry between the 2 is near-unbeatable.That said,I have to praise the other characters for fantastic jobs.Steve Buscemi as the freaked out but sensible Mr Pink,Michael Madsen as the psychotic ear-hacking Mr Blonde and the late Chris Penn as the 'boss' so to speak,Nice Guy Eddie.I love this film,so should you Enjoy The Film Sean",8,1,3,20 April 2006
The Untouchables," I could watch this film once a week and not get bored
","Chicago in the time of Al Capone.One man puts together a group,determined to bring him down.They were The Untouchables.Robert De Niro as Al Capone is genius casting,and Kevin Costner as Elliot Ness is another fine example.For me though,the show goes to Jim Malone,played by the truly excellent Sean Connery.From beginning to end,you hate Al Capone and want to see him bought to justice,and every time he tries to stop Ness and his team,it makes you want them to get him even more.Very few films can get you behind a group of characters so much.Charles Martin-Smith and Andy Garcia help complete the true Fantastic Four in a film I recommend to any and everyone.Enjoy The Film Sean",8,1,3,20 April 2006
Bram Stoker's Dracula," If there hadn't been a book,it would have been good
","This film works as a Hollywood blockbuster,it has a great cast,a decent plot and enough action and suspense combined to satisfy the needs of the average movie-goer.However,if you have read the book without watching the film,then don't.The film adds a love interest between Dracula(Oldman),and Mina Harker(Ryder) which never happened.The innocent virgin Lucy Westenra(Frost)becomes a horny young girl full of innuendos and more than happy to strip off.Characters such as Dr.Seward(Grant),Abraham Van Helsing(Hopkins),Renfield(Waits)...who are so well developed in the book,become mere passers-by who make you cringe.I have no idea why any actor/actress would want this on his CV,they must have been paid a vast amount of money to want to contribute to the destruction of this perfect book.However,I'm sure some of you would still like to watch this film,so I advise you to,you may enjoy it...just pretend that it isn't based on a book and you'll be fine.Enjoy the Film Sean",3,0,1,19 April 2006
The Godfather," The Greatest Film of All Time
","I cannot stress just how perfect this film is.However,I will try.I watched this film as a fan of mafia films,so maybe I was going into it biased,but I have never been so captivated by a film,you ignore the fact it is 3 hours long.The directing is perfect,the casting is perfect,the acting is perfect...everything about this film is top class.From the hot-headed Santino(Caan),to the rational Tom (Duvall),from the reluctant Michael(Pacino) and especially the Don(Brando). These characters have such on-screen chemistry and every actor compliments their co-stars brilliantly.The film also succeeds as being one of the few gangster films to draw out such varied emotions.Anger when the Don' life is threatened-sadness when Santino dies trying to save his sister-joy when the Corleone family wipe out the competition at the end.This film has nothing wrong with it.I'm not even joking when I say you're life is a waste if you have not watched this filmEnjoy The FilmSean",10,0,2,20 April 2006
