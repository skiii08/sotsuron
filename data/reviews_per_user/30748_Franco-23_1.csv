The Blair Witch Project," Know more about this film or you may be very disappointed
","I don't like to ask too much about films that I have decided to see anyway. This time it was a mistake! I wouldn't say that the film is bad, but to me it was somehow boring, never scary, very few things were appealing. I give 3 points to the film, because it was original, period. I was expecting better shots, better performances, better scenarios, better everything. I've seen much more interesting films of this type (most of them are European, by the way).",3,0,1,9 August 1999
