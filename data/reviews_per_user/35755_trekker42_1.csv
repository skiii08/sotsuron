Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Horribly overrated
","I can't quite get what it is that people see in this movie.  No matter where I go, there's always someone there who's in love with it.  But for the special effects and Liam Neeson (the only one who was worth his shirt acting), the movie was worthless.  All it is is a stage setting for the next two episodes, and from the looks of Episode II, neither of them will be much good either.  Lucas should've stuck with Indiana Jones.  All four Star Wars movies have been overrated as quality film, when Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi were the only decent ones.",Null,0,1,19 December 2001
