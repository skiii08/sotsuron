The Blair Witch Project," Good idea, bad movie.
","I went to this movie trying to ignore all the hype.  Several of my friends swore up and down that the movie was not fiction, and that it was a documentary...  I know, my friends are idiots, but hey.  As it turns out, my friends loved the movie, and continued to think that it was real until the sequel came out.I thought the movie was just plain bad...  The concept was good, but the movie was bad.  I loved the unique way that the producers used the camera, but that's about it.  There is nothing to see in this movie.  The producers obviously tried to scare people with suspense, but the suspense was just bad...  Good suspense will get a 'WTF is that?' reaction out of me.  Or perhaps a 'Oh S**t, this is gonna be bad' reaction.  But this movie didn't get that kind of reaction out of me.  Throughout the whole movie all I saw were people being scared.  'Ok, they look pretty scared.' 'Yup, still scared' 'Ok, I wonder why they are scared' 'Hummm, I guess they are really scared' 'Ok, now they're freeking out...'  Watching other people be scared is not suspenseful, even though the producers thought it was.  The only reason that my idiot friends liked it, is because they thought it was real...  If you are easily fooled by the mass hype of the movie, this movie will probably entertain you.",1,1,3,17 May 2001
