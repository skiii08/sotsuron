Kill Bill: Vol. 2," impressive second part
","Continuing the other film, vol. 2 tell us the story of the revenge of the Bride. After killing Vermita Green and O'Ren Ishii, Black Mamba continues its duty by searching Budd and Elle, in order to later kill Bill. Much less violent that the first part, vol. 2 is much more poetic, as it tells us many things about the motivations of the characters. The curious resignation of Budd(impressive Michael Madsen, absolutely fantastic), the evilness of Elle (unexpected Daryl Hannah) and the total charisma of Bill (mythic Carradine) marks the development of the drama, as the Bride meets everyone. With a delicious treatment of the dialogues and the music this is possibly, the best film from Tarantino and his violent universe. This time though, the violence is most psychological rather that physic, its more an impressive fight of wills which builds one of the best films of the decade of 2000. Despite that, remember that it is a Tarantino film. there is not much violence on the movie, but it is totally present in every moment of the film, which cannot result comfortable to everybody.",9,6,11,10 August 2006
Requiem for a Dream," The heir of transpoitting
","In the same line as 'transpoitting', requiem for a dream brings us a story of different lives absurdly spend by the influence of drugs. At first we meet the characters: three friends that, as they had nothing more to do, they take drugs to forget how bad is their life. Meanwhile, we know the mother of one of them, who lives alone and has no More company than TV and auto-help preachers. We can see how they fell in the depht of addiction, how things seem good at first and, of course, then, the cruel reality of being addicted. With very good playing, it is the real than the actors seem, the greatest point of the film. A very good and touching story, full of feelings and moments of cruel and unholy reality. Brutal, conscious and explicit, a really good movie about drugs. Unluckily, the idea of the director of filming it like a music clip (rapid changes of camera and lots of turnings of the image, to represent that they are in the influence of drugs), mess a little the result, with a better image directing, it could have been better indeed. Not recommended for weak people.",7,0,1,6 April 2006
Deja Vu," good idea, but not well done
","After a terrorist attack, the best agent of 'CSI' is called to try a new kind of tool to solve crimes: a kind of camera that allow you to see what happened 3 days ago everywhere. It is a good idea, how to rebuild the crime from the beginning, but at the middle of the film it became a typical action film with a superhero-I-can-do-everything that is simply correct. It tries to go deep and to be different by putting in the time aspect, but after the rules are set: There's no way to change the future, and everything you do guides you to your future; just at the end, they change, as Denzel is so good, he changes the future and he does it in a very incoherent way, as he is in love with someone he has not met yet (he'll do 3 days after). Actors are not bad, but as the script is incoherent, the result is not good. I don't mind movies messing with time, but I'd like them to do it correctly. What starts as a thriller, soon became a sci-fi thriller and ends incoherently as a typical action movie where things happen without any reason (what a way to fell in love!) usually is not good. These mixes could result wonderful, but it is hard to do the mix well and, well this is not an example of that. Due to his incoherent script the movie results disappointing, but it is a good point to remark the good job of the director, being able to do a decent (not good) movie with this script. The idea was good, but the story was never interesting. I hope next Tony Scott movie is better.",5,1,3,16 January 2007
Finding Neverland," triumph of Imagination
","Barrie is a very well-known writer that is in a writing-stuck: he has no inspiration. This changes when he meets Davies family, which will make him recover inspiration and make him to create the wonderful world of Neverland; writing the very well known book 'Peter Pan' With a great directing the film shows us the inside world of the writer, being more time in his imagination rather than in reality, which creates a world of fantasy and enjoyment. Actors are spectacular, specially Johnny Depp (his nomination is totally deserved) and Dustin Hoffman (Hook again?). The dressing and the photography is quite good also, as we are in front of one of the best films in 2004. The film claims for the triumph of fantasy, as if you don't like this world, just imagine a new one and live there (this can not always be good); and also the film has a remembering that, despite the fact that you can live in other world, there is, here, the real world and you cannot avoid that if you cannot life here, probably there you will not be happy at all (or not for a long time). The film is good, but the starting is a little slow and I've missed at least some comment's about the darkest aspect of Barrie: the adultery, pedophilia... All in the puritan Victorian age, the same that made Wilde to commit suicide; a larger mention of these aspects I think could have done this film to be better.",8,0,1,1 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," fun, adventure, and these kind of things
","Now, the Captain Jack Sparrow seems to have a problem with John Davey, the lord of the Oceans, captain of the legendary Flying Dutchman. In order to avoid it, he spills Will and Elizabeth wedding and takes him to another adventure. Meanwhile, they will have to fight the forces of Beckett, the general of the English army that tries to erradicate the pirates of the sea. More empty of depth than the first, but funnier and with more adventures and spectacular scenes. If you like the movies where you don't have to think and just sit and relax, this one is good. Anyway, the movie has nothing more than fireworks. Spectacular and enjoyable, the movie can result very entertaining (the 2 long hours it last become short while watching to it). It is just adventures in the old style, without pretending being more, and well, it is well done. It has lots of signaling that are important for the third part (they were filmed together) which can pass unseen unless you watch it as a whole. But well, just relax and take a good time.",7,0,2,31 July 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," typical pirates story, but astonishingly catching
","Jack Sparrow is a pirate without ship, the evil Captain Barbosa has stolen the Black Pearl (jack's ship) and he wants to recover it. Qill Turner is a young smith that is in love to Elisabeth Swann, the noble of the island. When she is kidnapped by Barbosa, he and Sparrow will work together (more or less) to defeat the evil Barbosa. This is the curious thing that surprised everybody, it has anything new, special effects are nowadays typical, it should be one senseless unknown film, but it had a great success. Why? Depp's acting as Jack Sparrow was just superb (nomination to Oscar included), he is able to make o charismatic character that all becomes easy when he is by there. Showing us one of the best character presentation in the last years, he is the one who really supports the movie. Rest of characters are correct and charismatic, but it is not SO impressive, this is the main thing of the movie, all actors make a good and catching part. In addition, the special effects are fabulous (as expected in such a expensive-to-make film), it is filled with stupid funny jokes (which you laugh because they are them) and a very confusing plot (who is friend of who??), but the result is funny and absolutely enjoyable.",7,0,3,23 September 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Good film
","Well, this film has all the things needed to be a good one. A fantastic story that never bores, good acting (unexpected in kids), beautiful scenario and spectacular Special Effects ( I suppose that the Accademy should not forgot this film.It remembers LOTR, which is not strange, due to their authors were good friends, but in a difference with Jackson film, it is much more optimistic and lighter (not so dark). There are some scenes that are really well done, like most of the battles and the introduction of the character of Aslan, which represents perfectly the good and firm authority.In addition I 've been well impressed by the acting of the White Witch, because it is really good! Its a perfect antagonism of Aslan and exhales a so great loathing aura that results surprisingly terrifying. This is remarked in the battle, where we can see her riding a war chariot pulled by 2 enormous polar bears, it is simply, impressive (This is the most evocative view of the movie). Despite this quality, here are also some details to be improved. We can see all the kids fight in the battle with a great quality, as veteran warriors, when teorically is the first time they use a sword of a bow, and in addition, we never hear about training or something like that, This is not bad, but it's a little incoherent. In the battle, we can see lots of warriors fighting, and the kids, with heavy armours and shields, are too less big, compared with the rest of the people that result a little pathetic, specially Edmund, who is specially skinny. It refocus into the idea that they should not be there... Finally, and this is only for the Spanish version: Someone could have chosen a better voice for Edmund? He is very annoying and every time he talks, he seems a crying baby, if the voice was better chosen, the movie in Spain would have been better, I am sure. To sum up: a very good adventures film, similar to LOTR, with great Special Effects and very entertaining. However, some people can consider it a bit childish (it is no t as dark as LOTR), I hope there is the second part soon.",8,0,1,1 January 2006
The Notebook," why so well considered?
","In this film there are two mixed stories: at 40's Noah and Allie meet themselves at the summer in a little town of South USA. They quickly fell in love despite the fact that they are from very different families, which will cause them lots of troubles. lots of years later, in an asylum, an old man reads to a woman the story of Allie and Noah, that it is written in an old crappy notebook. This movie is considered one of the best of the year, but i can't agree. Despite the fact that the script is very good, the development of the story, the idea of the power of love...The election of the main young pair splits it all, I cannot find any kind of chemistry between them, they never seem (specially she) comfortable in their parts, which make the young's story (the most important) very annoying and hard to watch. On the other hand, the old's story is much better, good acting and directing, and, as it goes after, and the fact that it is VERY well ended, it leaves you a good feeling, but I have found most of the two hours before quite boring; which has caused me to put it not as good mark as other people has done.",5,3,4,13 August 2006
The Mummy," adventures in the old style
","The high-priest Imhotep was in love with ank-sun-amun, the wife of the Pharaoh, when they were catched, he was condemned to the worst of the hexes, become the Mummy. 3000 years later, he is able to awake and he will do everything is needed to return his love to life. Meanwhile, Rick O'Conell and Evelyn (the ones who have awaken the mummy) will do all they could to stop the Mummy, because, if he wins, the world will be destroyed. It is a precious adventures movie like the best classics of the genre. It has spectacular Special Effects, too: the scene of Imhotep turned into a sand storm catching and airplane is superb, for example, and not is the only good FX scene... One of the best secondary characters is Evelyn's brother, the typical dumb character that puts the comic note in it, curiously, results really funny and it never bores in his not so selfish acts. In the plot there is something to show. How the good loving imhotep turns later in the evil Mummy? I realize that his death can make him a little angry, but it results a little curious. (In the second part become clear that he is not bad, but that he will not any effort for being good, he only wants to be with her love and the other thing are irrelevant). One thing to unline is the surprisingly good acting of Vosloo as the Mummy, without speaking almost anything, it results perfect convincing, and you can know lots of things about his personality, only by his actions. To sum up, this is a good adventures film to enjoy the time seeing a classic adventure movie, that can be condensed in three phrases: save the pretty girl, kill the bad one, save the world.",8,0,0,28 January 2006
Constantine," quite good
","Constanine is a man with the power to see angels and demons in our world; as he knows he is going to go to hell when he dies, he tries to kill as demons as he can in order to gain the pass to heaven; One day, he discovers than things are going ti change in Earth... Comparing with the comic which is based, the movie is completely different, for most puritan fans, it will be terrible. However, the movie is a good action-fantastic film, with great special effects and quite good action scenes. The acting is not very good, but it does not demand that, fireworks are more important in this kind of movie, and they are really good! It does not bore at any time and results totally enjoyable. In addition the idea of a world in three parallel dimensions (Heaven, Earth, Hell) connected by portals is quite interesting and results enjoyable. To sum up, this seems the typical bad film of an adaptation of a comic (as Daredevil, or Hulk), but is really well done for being one of this films, because it is exciting and enjoyable without being too much violent or boring, and the results is much better as expected, so it deserves a 7. (this genre, usually does not deserve more than a 4-5)",7,1,3,15 February 2006
Match Point," interesting, sometimes boring
","Chris is an ex-professional tennis player who starts training a rich British guy. As her sister fells in love to Chris, his style of life rises up. However, Chris is in love to his sister-in-law, Nola, so they start a hot romance. As she wants to make everybody to know it, Chris decides to take drastic measures to avoid it. In this film, Allen thinks about luck and its influence in life by telling us a history of a greed man that rises, as he has luck. There we can see his goals and his fears (surprisingly good acting of Rhys Meyers) and his relationships with all the family. It is also compulsory to remark the good paper of Scarlet Johansson (Nola) as a femme-fatal, in which she shows how good actress she is. The history is curious and the directing is good: all scenes are important, any empty one, well build characters (Woody Allen is a great director, he know to make things well). On the other hand, I've missed Allen's sense of humour, most of the movie, though interesting, is quite boring, as we watch all the serious moments in Chris' life, the main problem is that the main character is not very charismatic and some moments, though needed, are quite moment. Probably the most realistic Allen's film in a long time.",6,1,2,31 March 2007
Scary Movie 2," bad, though sometimes funny
","A mad professor recruits the survivor of the last film (and new friends) to go to an ancient haunted house. Whith these so intelligent bunch of people, ghost will have their time to frighten them. And of course, absurd moments every time. This is all, the plot is just an excuse to make one joke after another, some of them are decent, most of them are bad. Now making a parody of 'The Haunting' and everything they find, the result is a film that is funny, and sometimes disgusting (some joke are too much gross) but its only main is to make you laugh. Most of the film kicks intelligence and is stupid and absurd, anyway it has one or two good jokes, to spend 70min relaxed with a stupid movie and that's all, do not expect more.",3,1,2,8 August 2007
Closer," not bad...
","I think the history is not very well built and results too much absurd. Despite that, actors work is really good, and, from my point of view, that saves the quality of the film. The story advances in a strange way, with changes in time that are not shown to us until some time later, so usually,it is difficult to understand WHEN it's happening after the end of the scene. In addition, the characters claim to believe in love and loyalty, but they don't think in nothing more than sex, sex and sex. The director has not done a good work, nor the writer, on the other hand, actors made a great part, (specially both men, including one nomination to the Oscar's), actor's work is, by far, the best part of the film, if they were not so good, film would be too much bad. It is not strange that is well marked by kids, because they only catch the sex part so they are pleased, but it is usual that they don't catch the complicated personality of the characters and why they do those things, so it is not strange, also, that older people, more used to think about it, think that is a worse film. a 6, it's not bad, neither good.",6,0,0,18 December 2005
The Godfather: Part II," the best 2ยบ part ever
","Continuing with Corleone's family, now Michael Corleone is the Godfather. While his father was wise and thoughtful (though merciless) Michael is brutal, impetuous and threatening. We are able to see how the power corrupts Michael and he begins to become more lonely and desperate, like in a Shakespeare writing facts makes the character to get close to his fatal destiny. Meanwhile, the director show us, perfectly, how Vito was able to become the first Corleone's Godfather. All the actors are just impressive, with enormous acting for great characters. All of them play their parts with a thrilling strenght and follow a so powerful history that makes it one of the best film ever and, by far, the best second part ever filmed. It is just a perfect masterpiece.",10,1,3,28 May 2007
Léon: The Professional," Just wonderful
","Leon is a merciless hit-man, he kills for money and has anyone in the world. His neighbor, Mathilda, is a 12-year-old girl that lives with her family, which is absolutely unstructured: the father sells drugs, the mother takes them and her sister only thinks about her body. One day, another hit-man kills Mathild'as family, but she is saved from death by Leon, who, at the last moment, decides to take care of someone and saves her. She is much more adult that it seems and hire Leon to revenge the death of her family. Their relationship will change their lives forever. Probable Luc Besson's best work, he directs a perfect script, without any hole. Actors play perfect parts and all the action scenes are perfect: hard, but not too much, long but not too much, intense, but needed. The story is also touching, moving, totally believable, with a very catching end. Recommended to anyone, it is just wonderful.",10,0,2,11 February 2007
The Last Legion," and this pretend to be good???
","Well the plot is the same of Manfredi's book. The young kid Romulus is the last of Roman emperors. When Rome is sold to barbarians, he must go away to Britain to save his life, protected by his most faithful bodyguards. There, the last battle for the honour of Rome will begin, starting also the myth of King Arthur. This plot is not bad, and quite interesting, but is the only good thing of the movie. Characters are quite stupid, most of the dialogues are silly: the hand fight, the 'seduction' of the captain, the finding of the sword, the attack to the Emperor's palace (and twenty barbarians conquer all Rome???). This, mixed with quite bad action scenes (all the fights are awful, there's no contact, in fact most of the time you can see the space between the bodies!!), worse special effects (Ambrosius throwing fire) and the worst of all is the historic facts: When was a LIberty Statue in Rome? Why the Emperor's palace is 3 metres far to the forest? It was not in the middle of Rome?? When there was huskies in the Roman Empire? (at the British town) Why the swords had no blood after beating an enemy?? (well, in the last battle they had...) In addition to this, the thing that upsets me more is the fact that the movie pretends to be good! It exhales an aura of: 'I'm telling you the truth' that makes it irritating! It is almost insulting, doing something so bad, and indeed present it as a master piece.",1,17,34,17 September 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Perfection (well, almost)
","What can I say that is able to describe the immense quality of this film? Words don't come easy when I try to describe the impressive beauties of an epic legend turned into images. The enormous task of adapting the film is superb, with and outstanding plot, a perfect direction and a very well chosen casting of actors! Is is a film that fills and overwhelms all I had imagined when I read the book. There is few films than for me, deserve a 10, if I could, for this one, I would give a 12 to it!!! Emotion, action, love, passion, tragedy, greed... All the most touching emotions of our world moved into an fantastic and moving world filled with strange creatures that will, of course, make you stay 4 hours (yeah, 4!, so big is the greatness of the film!) in your sofa, absolutely amazed and desiring to know how continues. Peter Jackson (the director), must have been inspired by God to do such a perfect film!",10,2,3,27 December 2005
Over the Hedge," better than expected
","RJ is a ferret that has a great problem, Vincent the bear has threaten him to eat him unless he recovers a wagon filled with provision. RJ will use Verne's family (a bunch of different good-oriented animals) to achieve his objective. He will lead them to the city, where they can steal the things that human doesn't want. The movie intends to be a fun comedy (it has some great moments) and a light critic to human society, too consumerist, and it remains in a strange fifty-fifty, that, unusually, is not upsetting. The quality of the design is good and it results correct to the movie, maybe the action scenes are a little too quick but that's not very bad. I expected it being as bad as ' a Shark's tale' and it is much better, it does not arrive to 'finding Nemo' or 'the Incredibles' but remains as a correct movie. The result is a film that can entertain the kids and that will not bore the parents.",6,0,1,18 August 2007

After knowing it, they decide to help hi, giving him advice to being able to do it. This will lead him to some 'funny' moments until he reaches his objective. Absurd comedy, with stupid plot and stupid characters, any actor is good and the script is also incoherent. Maybe one of the worst stupid-American-comedies I've ever seen. Despite that, it has 2 or 3 funny jokes that make the pill easier to swallow. I cannot understand why this move have this undeserved fame. There are lots of better films.",3,5,11,5 November 2006

","Frank is a guy that lives (o seems to live) a quiet existence at French Mediterranian. He is a transporter: he brings things to one place to another, no asks, no names. One day, his packet starts to move and, wanting to know why it is moving, decides to broke his own rules and open it. Inside there's a beautiful woman that will turn his quiet life into a nightmare. The story is anything new, actors are not good, it has any touching moment, why is it good? Due to its ingenuous purpose: entertain. It is a film done with the only aim to make you to enjoy your time and well, it does! This is a typical plot, even for an action film, very seen and predictable. Anyway, the action scenes, the fights, the strange charisma of the main character, it all mixed makes the film very entertaining. It is not precisely a masterpiece, but it is worth it, the movie is totally enjoyable and ideal to spend 90 minutes.The stunts, explosions and fights are thrilling and sometimes unbelievable. Ideal to enjoy as a young teenager. If you like action films, you'll love this movie.",6,1,2,20 December 2006

Desperate, she goes the evil witch Ursula in order to make her human, but this will have dreadful implications... This is the typical Disney movie of the beginning of 90's, good adventures, charismatic characters a good story and good music. It not arrives to the quality of Aladdin or The lion King but it is quite good. The best of it are the songs, maybe the film has one of the best Disney's OST of all times (only after Aladdin, I think), which is very good. Ideal to have a nice afternoon with your kids. PS: Many people claim that most of scenes are obscene, but I think this is product of puritan people that want to see something that does not exist.",7,1,1,2 April 2006
Shrek the Third," funny but the worst of the 3
","The king is old and ill and Shrek must become the new King, as he doesn't want to, he must go to Worchestershire High school to find Artie, the next candidate. While he is away, Charming prince will take the power in order to be the King. Well the movie is at any moment boring and the 90 minutes it longs pass in a moment, but anyway, it has lost that fresh air it had, it is funny, but not so original. I smiled and laughed most of the time, but the incredible jokes that make you start to cry due to laughs have been lost. However, it is still funny. Now a problem is that there is a lot of characters and it is difficult to follow and recognize everybody (Who is RumpleStilking?) and it makes things sometimes a little confusing, but the plot is easy to follow as now the parodied things are Disney's films (sometimes cruelly). The technical part is superb, though, I cannot remember such a great number of bodies in the screen and all different and acting in such a natural way, in these part, only 'Cars' is at its high; on the other hand, the fact that it is not so good film as the others makes the result a little disappointing, bit it is still good anyway.",6,0,1,5 July 2007
Transformers," Impressive special effects (and nothing more)
","Sam Witwicki is the poor boy of his school, he dreams in the prettiest and he knows that he never will be able to be with her. when he buys his first car (an ancient Camaro) his life changes. The Camaro results to be a Transformer. An ancient civilization devastated by war between the Autobots (that defend the liberty) and the Decepticons (that defend that the stronger must command). They search a legendary artifact: the Cube, that will unbalance the war to one side. Well first of all it is compulsory to congratulate the fantastic special effects that are on the movie. They not seem CG at any moment and sometimes it is like the robots are also actors. The landing of Starscream or the skating of Barricade are good examples. All the action scenes and all the moments when the robots fight are just impressive. It is clear that Michael Bay knows how to do this things. The main problem is the fact that the movie has nothing more than that, the story is childish and it has some little holes with the size of an Death Star. Many things happen without any reason, the good ones solve many problems just because they are the good ones, there are lots of stupid jokes in order to make people laugh (only the robots hiding in the garden is good). Thinking about the fan side, the fact that Bumblebee is know a Camaro, well is kind of heretic, but once you accept this, it is good, the movie is like the comic totally, it is as it should be if the comic was a movie. Probably with a more worked plot the movie would have been a good one, but, well it's a blockbuster, then, there's no will of making it good, just spectacular (And it really is).",5,2,7,18 July 2007

Astonished by the happiness environment, decides to kidnap Santa and make a Hallowe'en Xmas. A delicious animation musical, full of adventures, love and a refined Gothic black humour. It leaves us the idea that we have to find our place in the world and be happy with it, not trying to be what you are not. This is the main idea, but it is told to us in Burton's way, that is with a very dark humour and in a funny and scaring world. The job of doing it by stop-motion technique makes that the esthetic is unusually good and different to usual, which makes the story more touching; in addition to the enormous work that is working in this way. A fantastic film, recommended to every body (maybe kids could be a little scared)!!!",9,1,2,7 January 2006
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," every movie is worse
","Well Harry potter is in his fifth year at Hogwarts and these time they will have to face the fact that Voldemort is on the strike again, despite the fact that the Minister doesn't want to recognize this. Well, it is interesting to remark the fact that, as long as the books are better the movies are worse. In the fourth one, we only saw the tournament and well it was not bad, these time there's a bunch of things that happen together in the book and the movie doesn't focus in any of them, then, there's no concrete plot, as the movie wants to tell lots of things but tells any. None of the stories are well developed and it i hard to follow how the movie goes. In addition, the special effects, that used to be impressive, this time are just invisible, there's almost any scene where they are the most little astonishing. Only the fight in the Parlament is decent, but we have seen lots of this before. Unluckily for Potter's fan, this movie is not good, I hope that the next are better. Anyway, is Harry POtter, it is still enjoyable.",4,0,1,20 July 2007

There he will meet his brother-in-law, a fanatic's football supporter. At first, he will feel frightened and confused, but he will discover a world of faith and loyalty, but also full of violence, danger and stubborn stupidness. When his new companions discover he was going to be a journalist, his problems will begin. This movie is quite original: the problem of English hooligans from a the American point of view. The movie is interesting, and the actors are quite well. Most of the things that happen are logical, but maybe a little exaggerated. The most disappointing part is the fact that the main characters seems to find positive being a hooligan and does not show any sign of changing his mind; despite the fact the movie shows us how dangerous and disgusting is fighting to other people only because they support another team (or only because they want to fight). The movie may contain too many topics, but results catching and entertains you about tow hours. A good one, there are better, but there are many, many worse films.",7,0,0,9 January 2007
The Graduate," Not so good, but good anyway
","The movie tells us the story of a young student, that, just after graduate, is seduced by an old rich woman. Then, he will fall in love with her daughter, which will cause everything to collapse. The very famous movie of 'the graduate', considered as one of the best films ever is, well, good, but I think it is not so good. The acting is very good, specially Mr.Hoffman, who was in his first film and is still stick into the movies! The soundtrack is also wonderful (impressive S&G) but that is the best things of the movie. The plot, who was controversial for the time, now is quite seen and it is causes not so great scandal. It reflects decently the world of the 60's, where the old teenagers found themselves that they had finished their studies but the don't know what to do with her lives, but the director does not spends long time about it. The beginning of the story, the seduction part are superb, and I realize that is because of this that the movie has so great fame, but while the movie develops, the rest of the story is not so well filmed and that spoils the result, and it makes a movie that could be almost perfect to a movie that is just 'good', despite its excellent beginning,.",7,3,7,10 June 2007
The Mummy Returns," Better than the first
","This time, Stephen Sommers has forgotten the terror to film a pure adventure film, in the same way as Indiana Jones, with exoticism, adventures, dangers, and of course, good sense of humour, all mixed with spectacular special effects. The reincarnation of Ank-sun-ammun awakes the Mummy again, Inmhotep must fight with the Scorpion King in order to command his army a nd conquer the world. In this way, he will be able to enjoy his life with his lover forever. Unfortunately, this will mean the end for humans, so the O'Conells have to stop him. With a great sense of humour and adventure it is better indeed than the previous part, better special effects, and less terror,which makes the film better. All actors are great (for this kind of film) specially Voosloo, who makes the Mummy the most charismatic character of the film. On the other hand, the charisma of the characters of inmhotep and Ank-sun-amun is greater than the time they have in the film, the director could have taken more profit of their spectacular and precious love story to make the film more enjoyable; this guides us to another question: If the Mummy only wanted to be with his lover, why should he do all this mess to command Anubis Army, could he simply stay happily with her?? The film is funny and enjoyable, despite some things (as said before) that could have been filmed better. Ideal for enjoy during 2 hours with one of the best modern classical adventures film.",7,0,0,14 February 2006
Life Is Beautiful," Very good one
","Guido is a young-eccentric Italian Jew that begins his life in Toscana. There, with his personal way to live (life is beautiful, there's always place to optimism and to live happy, without hating) he is able to make Dora fall in love to him. They marry and have a child. Some years later, II World War begins, and him, as a Jew, is brought to a concentration camp. There, he will make all the efforts to make his kid to forget all the nightmares of the real life and tries to hide him by telling that this is a game. The movie has two different parts: the first one, a comedy where Benigni shows himself as a clown, and later in the concentration camp, where benigni makes a dramatic part, where, indeed in the worst places, there's time to hope. Very well directed, the film is never annoying and never too childish, nor excessively dramatic. The acting of Benigni is just superb, how, knowing that these are hard times, is he able to seem happy, as he is alive. The soundtrack is also wonderful and the script is very well done, all the scenes have their point and their importance for being there and the two hours it is long seem shorter when you are watching this film. one of the best modern masterpieces, beautiful, interesting, touching, highly recommended to everybody. The only bad point is the fact that the movie is sometimes quite fantastic and far from reality, there are some moments when Guido is in the camp, that, he would have died due to his acts, but he doesn't. I know it was an Italian camp, and their were not as evil as the Polish ones, but it is sometimes unbelievable.Anyway, life is beautiful, enjoy it!",9,2,6,30 December 2006
A Clockwork Orange," Impressive movie
","In a new future, the society has gone to an offspring. Alex is a charismatic intelligent guy that loves violence and evilness. He is the leader of a gang and we can see him doing some act of terrific ultra-violence, just for fun. When he is arrested, as he wants to leave prison early, he accepts to be part of a new treatment which will cause him to be a good citizen. This is one of the best Kinrick's movies. Cruel, satiric, intelligent. The fact that ultra-violence is shown to us with lots of ironic and black humour, in almost a hypnotic-oniric way makes it special, then, violence becomes wonderful, and this disturbs you, which is specially the main of the director, he is able to make you love such a disgusting guy. Then, as the violent becomes the Government, Alex is just a victim, a guy that only wants to live quiet, and the 'law' is the ultra-violent there, programming the prisoners, making them fools that cannot decide freely.It is a critic not only to the violence (of course violence is bad) but also to the way that a country uses to fight against it, which are the limit should not be passed? Who will guard the guards? With all these thing in mind, th movie is just a masterpiece, disturbing and sometimes uncomfortable, but impressively good. The choose of Malcolm as the main actor is just perfect, he is able to play perfectly this not so mad danger and makes us ask ourselves why he was not even nominated to Oscars. may cause repulsion due to its violence (though lot of time has passed!) but it is totally good. Recommended to everyone able to think about ethics and who wants to watch to a good movie that makes you think.",9,0,2,18 August 2007
Pulp Fiction," Great film!
","This is one of the most exciting films I've ever seen, with a curious and, later, typical way to deal with the time in Tarantino's films. The story is divided (for say something) in three parts: the date between Mia (the wife of Marcellus, a very jealous mafia boss) and Vincent Vega (a gangster that works for Mia's husband); the escape of Butch (after stealing Marcellus), and the efforts of Jules and Vincent to clean his car of blood and brain pieces. Travolta has to thank to Tarantino to give him the opportunity to come back to the cinema, because his part is perfect and has effectively, returned him to the hall of fame of Hollywood. Superb script, with lots of memorable dialogs, full with dialectical an ethical argument, that contrast with the brutal and violent environment of the city. 2 hours and a half that passes by without noticing, due to its great direction and its great scenes of action and dialog. One of the best films in history? Maybe, however, its great violence can make it disgusting for lots of people...",9,1,3,13 February 2006
The Da Vinci Code," good adaptation
","usually, most of the films based on a book are much worse than the book, but this is an exception. The book, though enjoyable, is quite bad (it has had these enormous success only because it criticize the Vatican, anything more; the book is like a funny comic, any literature value, but good for enjoying the time). However, the film is rather good (which was a surprise). The cast is really good: if I had to choose the best actors for all the roles, I'd chosen the same that were there, so, I can not complain! The film has a good rhythm and it does not stops during most of the film, the action develops itself in a fine way (good directed) and the puzzles are not boring but interesting.Maybe the ending is quite slow, and this, in addition to the great longness of the movie can result tiring for some people. To sum up, I'm quite pleased with this film, I expected it to be bad, but it is enjoyable. If you are not able to be easily offended about theological subjects, probably you will have a good time. It is curious that it is not needed to have read the book to catch everything that happens, which is unusual.",7,2,4,21 May 2006
The Godfather: Part III," A perfect conclusion
","Years have passed and Michael Corleone is now an old man. HE has become THE GODFATHER, everything that happens in US passes by his hands, he puts and quits presidents, governors... But he lacks the most important for him: his family. In a latest attempt to recover them, he tries to abandon and crime and become a gentlemen, but the past will not let him do it. The best of the three? It is stupid to say it, all are just perfect. Al Pacino is as superb as the other two, and the inclusion of an extremely inspired Andy Garcia (bad luck he wasn't ever able to repeat such a good part) and the rest of the cast are just wonderful. The development of the drama, almost following a Shakespeare's drama, the strength of the scenes, it is a movie that deserves to be in the Olimp of the cinema. It is just a masterpiece. Unfrotunately, the Oscars were not in its favour (0/7 no way!)",10,9,19,30 July 2007
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," not as bad as expected
","Mr & Mrs Smith are the typical bored pair, but they both have a secret, they are hire-killers that work for rival companies. The fun will start when they find out that they have to kill each other. This of course, will cause their love to tremble. With these absurd plot I expected the film to be absolutely awful, but, in the end is a mix between comedy and action film, which is able to not be too tiring at any scene. Most of the lines are stupid and nonsense, but the movie results funny sometimes, and it is clear to see the chemistry between both main characters. It's like Ocean's Eleven, a blockbuster movie to watch and forget (but a little worse) and it will entertain you during the 100minutes it last.",5,1,4,1 May 2007
Wedding Crashers," typical American comedy
","Clive Owen and Vince Vaughn are two guys that go into the people's wedding only for flirting and going to bed with girls; one day, Owen finds a girl an he fells in love with her, this will change the relationship with his friend in a very funny way. More or less is the typical young guys comedy but a bit changed to use older actors. Despite the fact it is not boring, it is not very funny, as all the jokes are known and the movie has anything new to offer. the actors are not in their best part (well Owen is superb in this kind of characters, as always), but none of the rest of the cast can do it decently. The film has some good gags and a few more things, it is funny, special to spend a Sunday afternoon relaxed watching TV without demanding anything very good.",5,1,3,22 March 2006
Downfall," good piece of reality
","The movie tells us the last days of the life of Adolf Hitler. From the point of view of his secretary, frau Junge, we can watch how was this man, his personality, his craziness... We are able to see how are the last days of Berlin, the battle that is going to destroy the city and how different characters deal with this moment: some disobey Hitler and run for their lives, others commit suicide due to Hitler orders... The film is 2h 30m long, but you are so immersed in the story that probably you will not be able to realize that. The actors task is superb, specially Bruno Ganz (Hitler) and Ulrich (Goebbels) who play the most spectacular acting of Nazis leaders I've never seen. Touching and hearth-taking, this is one of the most hard war films ever done, as we are able to see how the city is destroyed and a country disappears (usually war films are about victories, not defeats). Unluckily, there are so many characters and so many aspects that the director wants to show that sometimes the spectator can find himself a little lost about what is happening to who. I realize that this is a hard task for the director and it does it quite well but this fact can result a little disappointing. To sum up, this is one of the best films of its year (nomination to Oscars included) and its recommended to both the ones that like good cinema or the ones that want to know about one of the darkest moments of the Humanee.",8,1,2,6 August 2006
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Nice
","There's something about Dracula story that anyone could not know? Johnathan Harker travels to Transilvania to help a noble to move to London. Unluckily, this noble is Dracula, the vampire, the Undead; and, as he sees a picture of John's fiancée (mina), he falls in love and decides that she must be for him. He move to London and there he fights with JOhn's friends in order to conquer Mina's heart. Said for someone as a terror film, actually is a very good love story with a very dark environment and, of course, a great quantity of violence. This violence, though, is totally needed for the story, which makes it more interesting. The actors are great, so as the make-up. Gary Oldman dressed as Dracula is totally astonishing. Despite it is 2 hours and a half long, it never seems so long and time passes quickly as the film continues; while you are involved into a precious dark love story beyond death.",8,0,0,21 February 2006
The Green Mile," Long touching film
","Mr. Edgecomp is the keeper in the green mile, the prison for the people that are condemned to death. One day arrives a new killer: John Coffey, who has raped and murdered two little girls. Even at the first moment, he notices something weird in Coffey, he seems nothing but a murder and strange things began to happen there, which make us realize that there's hope for miracles, even in that place. In this movie, the acting is superb, with one nomination to 'bear' Coffey, absolutely deserved, and a Tom hanks in his greats moments. The plot is very interesting and catches you from the beginning, and keeps you wondering what is going to happen at every moment. The movie throws you deep in the magical world of Stephen King, where, almost everything is possible and the atmosphere is, also, perfectly done. A great film that maybe is too long, when the ending is to arrive, the rhythm stops totally and makes the las half an hour a little boring; with a better work there, possibly it would have reached the ten. to sum up, a great hard film, with great story and great acting and a great amount of touching moments. Maybe too long, but very good anyway.",8,0,1,23 May 2006
Hitch," entertaining
","Alex Hitch is the best 'date assessor' of New York, but he only helps the people in love. Its relation with a yellow press journalist will cause all his world to collapse, because he can helps falling in love with her, but all the tricks he know results totally useless with her. Well, this is a relaxing and entertaining movie. It is like the usual romantic comedy, with some good jokes and with the presence of Will Smith, who, just make the part of Will Smith, but well, this time, results sympathetic and funny. It is curious how perfect is the style of Hitch, because everything in him, is thought and prepared, but results ideal. Sometimes can seem too much arrogant, but he is Will Smith! OF course he is arrogant!! Maybe it is not a great movie, but is better than the usual.",7,1,2,9 January 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," A modern masterpiece
","Andy (superb Tim Robbins) is condemned to stay all his life in prison due to two murders he has not done. There, he will meet Red (Morgan Freeman, impressive, these is one of the best relation love/friendship of all the movies I've ever seen). Red understand perfectly Andy and guides him at the first moments, as we see Andy from Red's eyes, his loyalty and admiration. We understand all these only by his looks and his moves, in one of the best parts of Freeman. Robbins play the part of a distant character, brave, righteous, intelligent, but as everyone, weak, frightened. It's like an angel in the depht of hell. The hardness of the prison and the corruption of the prison system is perfectly told to us by Darabont perfectly. Its realism is sometimes disgusting and the hardest scenes touches you at the depht of your heart. The film has a very high dramatic part, but in any moment becomes too sweety. Its wonderful dialogues, its magnificent study of characters and their psychologies, the charisma of Robbin's character, well absolutely everything helps that this film becomes part of the selected group of every time masterpieces. There are two scenes that I've loved a lot. The one where, Andy is able to listen, relaxed to a Mozart's Opera in the director prison's office (although being in prison, at that moment, Andy is free). And the other where, one of the prisoners, being very old and having spend almost all his life in prison, commits suicide as he cannot get used to a life in freedom. However, despite all the hardness and the few holes to hope that there's in the movie, at the end there's always a little ray of light. The Shawshank Redemption is that, a chant for life, for our dreams... a masterpiece.",10,2,3,25 December 2006
Vanilla Sky," remake of 'ABre los ojos'
","David Aames is the typical rich guy: he has nothing to do but flirt as much as he can, and good-looking is he, has he great success. His meeting with Gine and Sofia will change his life, as he will end totally disfigured and in prison, where his nightmare will begin and it will be difficult to distinguish between reality and dream. These movie is a remake of the Spanish Amenabar film: ' Abre los ojos', as usual, the remake is not as good as the original, but it is not bad, though. The action and the story is well told, and probably it is a little less dark (to adapt it to US market). On the other hand, neither Crowe nor Cruise are in their best moment, as Amenabar is much better than Crowe, and surprisingly, Noriega plays a better part than Tom. The movie, as a good copy, is good, but, if you happen to like it, please, go to the original version, it is much better.",6,0,2,18 June 2007
Casino Royale," This is not a James Bond movie
","Now, with Daniel Craig as Bond, James Bond, we are able to see how he fights with a terrorist banker. This time, Bond is more violent as usual (Brosnan refinement is dead) and it has lost all his charisma. Craig (at least in this film) is not Bond, he reminds more the anonymous character of 'Transporter' rather than Bond. In addition, Bond, must be a man of action, I can understand spending one hour in a poker match (well, it is well told) but, a Bond movie must end with lots of fireworks, not with about one hour of nothing. I think Daniel Craig can be more brutal way of seeing Bond, but the script of the film was not well done. There is no charismatic villain, it is much longer that it should be, as the ending is never-ending. In addition, there's no feminine erotic views, only Craig in shorts (what is Bond without bond-girls?) in order to make girls happier... It is not that it is an awful movie (it could be much better if shorter, but is viewable), it's the fact that it is not a Bond's movie, just an action one. If you're a purist, probably you'll hate it, if not, it is just a bad movie.",2,11,19,28 June 2007
X2: X-Men United," very good action film
","Striker, a chief of US secret services has thought a plan to kill all the mutants, this time, the X-men must work with Magneto to beat this danger that threatens to kill all humans in the world. This is one of the best action film i've seen in a long time. With a very good fighting scenes, a very interesting plot and a breathless action. The actors are perfect for all the characters, with a surprisingly good acting for being an action film. OF course the best are Ian and stewart, who give their characters so great and unexpected strengh that makes the film much better as one should expect. The special effects are very good and effective, and the action scenes are very well filmed. Much better that the first part, which is unusual. Maybe the best adaptation of a Marvel comic is ever made on film. Congratulations. Any fan should forget to watch this film. The main problem is that, if you don't know about the comic, probably, during most of the film, you will not understand anything, as the film consider that you know about the setting (this makes the mark a little lower, though).",8,0,0,18 April 2006
Aladdin," Fantastic!
","Magic, adventures, laughs, love... This film has everything mixed, and the result is quite good! The film is about the classic tale of 'Aladdin and the magic lamp', so the story is well known by everybody. Despite it is for children, the quality of the characters is very good, the story, though predictable and typical, results interesting and, which is more important, it males us to spend a good hour and a half. The songs (typical in Disney) never are boring, and are surprisingly well mixed with images. In addition, action scenes are well ended and most characters are very charismatic. Aladdin is sympathetic form the beginning and most secondary characters are simply perfect. The 'acting' of the Genius is superb in his strangeness and absurd, and Yafar is well remembered as one of the 'best' bad ones of the history of cinema. It exhales an immense aura of evilness hardly ever seen in a movie... To sum up, one of the best (maybe the best) Disney film made, which everything to have a nice afternoon with your children or just spending a nice time laughing and remembering when you were a child.",8,43,53,15 January 2006
Jurassic Park," A masterpiece
","In 1993, a film shocked everyone, it was Jurassic Park, with an unseen Special Effects and a catching adventures history, it surprised everyone. John Hammond is a rich man that has fulfilled his dream: to clone dinosaurs and make a tourist Park for them. In order to prove that it is safe, he invites a bunch of scientific: Drs Malcolm, Grant, Elle. But as they are in the middle of the visit, nature finds its way and the dinosaurs will escape and for humans a race for live will start. The movie is quite enjoyable, the characters are very charismatic and they catch you from the beginning. As usual in Spielberg's movie, action does not come early, but it is perfectly filmed and it keeps you thrilling about when things are going to happen. Special effects are superb, too. years have passed since the film was made and they are still impressive. They seem totally realistic and they are perfect for the movie. This is one of these films that proves why Spielberg is one of the greatest, as this is perhaps his best movie. To sum up, this is a movie that everyone should watch. A wonderful masterpiece for whom time does not pass.",10,3,5,7 April 2007
The Wizard of Oz," Delicious musical
","This is maybe one of the most known films ever, as it is difficult to people to remember a film earlier the 50's this is one that everyone can remember. And the film really deserves it. Dorothy is not understood in her farm of Kansas, she only wants to enjoy her time and she can't, so she wishes to go over the rainbow and travel to another place to be happy. then, a tornado catches her and takes her to the wonderful world of the Wizard of Oz, where she will live great adventures before returning home. With a perfect treatment of colour and a delicious music, the movie is a superb chant to fantasy and has influenced lots of films than has come after (for example 'Mary Poppins', does anyone can avoid the likeness being inside the picture and arriving to Muchkinland?). The film is sometimes quite childish (well it is a film for kids), but it is never sweety, it arrives to a perfect level of cuteness than cannot be but congratulated. In addition the songs are really good and, as later has happened with most Disney's films, are never the main part of the film; so the result is great. On the other hand, time has passed and, for example, special effects and make-up have changed a lot, but the film is so good that you will not take this in account. One of the best film in history, really really good.",9,2,4,25 April 2006
The Godfather," just perfect
","What can I say about 'the godfather' that has not been said before? That it is a masterpiece? That its staff is just wonderful? That the actors and soundtrack are superb? That it is considered one of the best films ever? Actually I don't know what more say, but it is true that it is hard to see more deserved good marks. I had never the opportunity of watching to it in original version and, when I did it, I could perfectly realize the fabulous wonder I was able to enjoy, Marlon Brando is just impressive, Al Pacino is as good as him, and James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton deserved to be congratulated. Thanks to Coppola, for giving us the pleasure of watching 'the Godfather'",10,3,6,23 May 2007
