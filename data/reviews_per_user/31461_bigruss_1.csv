Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas has done it again.
","With all the hype surrounding this movie, I was afraid it would not live up to the billing, it did and far surpassed it.  This film is one of the most technologically advanced films ever and backs up the eye dazzling special effects with a story line that leaves casual viewers thinking for days and Star Wars fans salivating for the the next two installments in 2002 and 2005.  Lucas does an outstanding job with the story and lets you in on information that only makes the original trilogy (Star Wars, Empire and Jedi) that much better.  I can not wait for Episode II, and recommend this film to any one of any age.",9,0,0,22 May 1999
