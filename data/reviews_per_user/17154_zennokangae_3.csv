Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Searing Satire of American Society
","Sacha Baron Cohen unabashedly turns the tables on every strand of American culture. From evangelicals, racist college students, jingoists, homophobes, pretentious southerners, idol- worshiping star stalkers, insanely violent New Yorkers, ugly rodeo patrons, morally compromised car dealers and the generally materialistic, unforgiving idiots that make up much of this country. The only beautiful scenes of America are the landscapes Borat and Azamat cross, devoid of Americans.The true meaning of the film materializes in the end, when the only redeeming American Borat meets is a prostitute and he hands out 'iPods' to his family in his village (where before, they couldn't afford a clock radio).This is a masterpiece of unflinching, courageous comedy-satire that should leave a bitter taste in American audiences mouths. But don't be angry with Sacha Cohen, take a look at the American Dream, so to speak. Is it really a dream, because for many, in America and mostly external to the nation, it has become a nightmare.High Five though! Now go get your 'bling on', look down your noses at the poor, don't vote, and get in as many physical fights and racist diatribes as possible. Do your duty America!",10,2,15,4 November 2006
The Elephant Man," There will always be Elephant Men
","I'm not writing any more plaudits for this movie, for most everything has been said about it before. Even a quarter century later, I weep everytime I watch Mr. Hurt and Mr. Hopkins in their roles. The great humanity of David Lynch and the producers has left us with an equally frightening and endearing vision of Mr. Merick.Sadly, there will always be elephant men, as long as ignorance and the impulse for destruction rule men and their domain.",10,19,21,10 July 2004
Platoon," Perhaps the Most Important Film of the 1980s, One of American Cinema's Finest
","I remember when this movie released nationally when I was only a kid. I'm only in my 30s and was still a toddler when the evacuation of Saigon commenced, however I have been touched by the Vietnam Conflict in many areas of my personal life. Having viewed this feature over and again, it wasn't until I watched Charles Keyselyak's documentary on the making of this film when I realized and remembered the full scope of this magnificent piece of American cinema (one of the view to win best feature as well as best director). As one user on this board illuminated, Platoon, 'was also a success at the box office grossing $250,000,000 world wide, making it the third highest grossing film of 1986.' One of those three films was the jingoistic piece of fluff 'Top Gun'; a film so anathema in tone to Platoon and iconic of the Reagan-Era. It was a privilege to view this film as a 12 year old boy and I went on to study History at the graduate level, this film contributing greatly to my ambition to understand how these moments, brutal periods in history transpire. My first employer had been shot up on an armored personnel carrier on the Cambodian border, my best friend's father had served in a tank company and was very troubled emotionally and the man who helped my family adopt my younger sister from South Korea lost both legs to an anti- personnel mine. I'll never forget seeing, at the time, adult men leaving one of the theaters in my home town weeping. I didn't understand what was going on at the time, but this is one of the most poignant memories I carry of this film and its impact. Sadly, Stone says in the documentary on the film that he hopes younger generations will be smarter, 'when some politician tries to sell them a used war like this one'. As of 2007, being in Iraq, it seems America has not learned the lessons, the sharp, divisive, horrific lessons of Vietnam enlighten the country and her government.",10,1,2,8 March 2007
