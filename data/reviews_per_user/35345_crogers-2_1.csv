Requiem for a Dream," The closest thing to a filmed nightmare.
","Of all the movies I've seen 'Requiem' probably disturbed me more than any other movie ever has.  If you don't already know.  The movie is about addictions.  Food, diet pills, and of course drugs.  I think Roger Ebert said this and I could agree more...he said it was a shame that the film was rated R, because it is so disturbing, and real, and scares the s*** out of you, that it would be a real eye opener for younger people to see how UN-glamorous drugs really are.  Leaving the theatre I felt like I had just awoken from a terrible nightmare.  It was that weird uneasy feeling that you get.  Your mind realizes that it was not real, but all those emotions and feelings you have are just as real.  Wow...quite a movie.",10,0,0,29 March 2001
