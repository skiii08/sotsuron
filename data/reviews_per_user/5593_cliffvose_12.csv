Skyfall," dire
","If you like to see a middle-aged reformed alcoholic man running and dodging bullets, bombs, petrol explosions and erm Dynamite, while grimacing, (does Craig have any more in his repertoire?) this movie is for you. Not to mention the awful wig worn by the central 'bad guy' whose character was seemingly based on an old Donald Sutherland role. Obviously the same hairdresser who styled Judi Dench's hair was employed. The Oedipus undertones are quite disturbing and the token white black woman even more so. Even by the Bond movie standard this has to be the nadir of film making. I am glad I didn't see it at a Multiplex or I would be demanding my money back. The worst of British.",1,6,26,3 February 2013
Darkest Hour," A Brexiter's dream.
","Brexiteers fed up of doing Suduko will love this one. Spot how many historical accuracies there aren't and win a prize. Those heady days during a world war when women could flop down on a bed and be viewed from above without all those tiresome prosthetics, when Asian people could smile in the street with impunity and the air was filled with Cuban cigar smoke... ahhh... the richness of human history is astounding. From a punk to a prime minister. Never has the social divide been so narrowly bridged as Mr Goldman...oops I meant Oldman....portrays. He justly deserves his globes served on a platter.",2,4,15,13 February 2018
The Irishman," Arthritis make-over.
",Just watched this miserable movie. Pity the big bosses can't fix the awkward symptoms of Robert De Niro's advances arthritis like they did his face. If you like your aged actors all looking like Gollum then this is your bag.,1,6,16,1 December 2019
Aquaman," Anything with Kidman in it
",Srupid me not to have read the reviews and cast list. La Kidman with inflated breasts all washed up. I wish her career was. Ghastly. Instant delete.,1,1,3,16 March 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A contrived attempt at exorcising the American dream.
","What a dismal show. The awards ceremony had more excitement than than this with the lead's choice of dress. A load of American BS. Dismal portrayals by all concerned. No wonder Woody Harrelson accepted the part of Willoughby, at least he wouldn't have to see it through until the end. Neither will I.",1,28,54,28 February 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Euuuch!
","What a load of rubbish. The acting is almost as bad as the terrible sound, the horrendous wigs and the direction. The editing is beyond belief. Awful rewriting of history. I wouldn't give it a point.",Null,2,6,23 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Stunt doubling's the pits
","Are we the viewing audience expected to believe, even with the artifice of poetic licence, that a 57 year old ex-husband of a 'Friends' character can vault fences and clamber onto roof tops? The continuity 'gal' should be prevented from ever working again in mainstream films after seeing the initial ridiculously staged fast car ride with Polanski and his the current squeeze. First hair blowing in the 'breeze' and then removing a head scarf before her hair is miraculously static. Errant nonsense and just another commercial for the values of the Republican party currently emboidied its president...Trump.A waste of time and fake tan.",1,3,5,25 November 2019
Prisoners," This Film has already been spoiled by the whole crew and cast that worked on it
","SPOILER ALERT..... This film has already been spoiled by the whole crew that worked on it....a group of hormonal teenagers win the lottery and decide to make a film ..as they have loads of dollars they decide to hire Hugh Jackman as the lead... as his big razor sharp knife fingers are a bit rusty he accepts... they all go off to 'the woods' shoot a deer and create a morally uplifting sense of well-being between father and son... before scaring the pants off each other cooking up the absurd script round the campfire while smoking' weed and dropping acid... and decided that Hugh Jackman should be like that handsome maniac in the X-Men and abuse his teenage son while torturing a man with the mind of a 10 year old, avoiding a stupid tattooed, tie-less policeman (he doesn't notice Jackman's bloodied, bruised and scraped hand after torturing a disabled person) with a boss like granpaw from The Waltons..but in a brown jacket...What a load of old toss. The inconsistencies, worn out plot devices red herrings and sheer effrontery to intelligence are too numerous to mention without arteries bulging in the neck area.... the continuity dept must have been on a gap year when they made this film...and as for global warming I am skeptical of it striking a small American town 4 times in a row over six days... snow, torrential rain, snow, more torrential rain AND frozen ground? The set must have come from Back To The Future surely.... no cars or people at night.... maybe they all went visiting for Thanksgiving? To get away from the token black family? The recovering alcoholic aggressive testicle on legs (Jackman). The drug addicted wife of the recovering alcoholic who's life changed nine and a half years ago when her husband stopped drinking and was finally able to shag her and produce a daughter? The crazy lady with a big hole in her garden who shoots guns in the middle of the night? The police? The deserted diner with a mystical Asian girl serving coffee? Another amoral tale from an amoral industry bent on destruction of narrative and interest.Prisoners: You will be, for 145 minutes and 45 seconds if you decide to watch it.",1,13,36,18 October 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Mishmash.
","On the release of this ultra-violent mishmash one wonders if cinemas supplied complimentary bed-sore cream or glue to keep audiences in their seats during 3 plus hours. Obviously the cinema-goers had nothing better to do than be insulted by a ridiculous conceit, even by Hollywood standards, indestructible alien versus some rich businessman with an armour fetish, an English 'butler', a bad dentist, no barber and a plot worthy of the Rubik-cube inventor. The constant propaganda interspersed with the soft-porn scenes between a brooding 'Superman' and 'Lola''would have Siegel & Shuster rolling in their graves.P:S Since when was the editor-in-chief of The Daily Planet addressed as: 'Perry' by his employees?",2,1,8,8 July 2016
Midway," Difficult to know where to start
",It's difficult to know where to start to criticize this straight-to-Broadway CGI-fest of nonsense. The 'guys' all together? The weeny guy who makes good? The grotesque distortion of historical events? The almost complete lack of any people of color ...except for the 'enemy' ...of course. If you have nothing better to do while waiting for the pool guy to turn up on a Saturday afternoon then this movie is for you. I give it 1 because there is nothing lower available on this site.,1,3,11,27 February 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," Woeful
","A woeful reprise of Reeves' role in The Matrix but without the long black robes and 'somersaulting' from scene to scene. The long black robes are replaced with cheap knock-off Italian suits, phony accents and to-ing and fro-ing between ill-thought out continuity scenes. The stereotypical film noir stereotypes still exist in the film's depiction of a weirdly familiar parallel universe of a lawless society completely devoid of awareness from passers-by and law enforcement officers. The wanton depiction of destruction of numerous automobiles is indicative of a society that values free movement but without the moral imperative to pay for it while the horrible depiction of middle-aged women choosing death at their own hand is a savage indictment of Hollywood at its nadir.",1,11,25,16 June 2017
Annihilation," Dismal
",If I was the writer whose book this dismal adaptation is based on I would be in litigation with the movie company. ''Nothing like the book.'' is a much bandied around epithet amongst critics but in this case it deserves it. The inherent racism and sexism embedded in this tale is truly horrifying. The main protaginist is a white professional woman who gets the best lines and the lingering soft porn gaze of the camera that is used in the unnecessary and gratutitous back story shots. If I want titilation I can access pornhub. The deep seated anxiety of contemporary culture is glaring in the imagery of a bear ripping through a chainilink fence (?) silently and then carrying off one of the lesser characters to have its way with her in the woods!?This film was obviously put together by millenials with too much spare cash for their own good. Avoid.,1,5,9,15 March 2018
