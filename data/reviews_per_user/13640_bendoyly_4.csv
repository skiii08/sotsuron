Sucker Punch," It had all the weapons it needed, so why didn't it use them!!!
","' I feel like the little boy, sitting in the corner of the sandbox, watching everybody else getting to play with his toys. ' This for me sums up Sucker Punch, in many ways it's like Zach Snyders playing out all his favourite video game fantasies contrived from dungeon and dragons, lord of the rings, district 9, inglorious bastards, and we have to just sit and watch, when there is no story to tell, also were not allowed to play. I could totally rip Sucker Punch apart, just by going into the lack of story and the inability to carry the plot forward in any great length and various other fatal flaws but strangely something is stopping me. I'll be kind and highlight it's spectacular action sequences, some brilliant costumes and spot on scenery, good enough to rival anything I've ever seen, and it's amazing soundtrack which fits in among the chaos perfectly. Never has a film brought out the Jeckyll and Hyde more in me, I'm torn, but ultimately I can't shake the fact that at it's core Sucker Punch is a total mess and could have been oh so special. Basically Sucker Punch is like THE food fight of all food fights, it's messy, totally unnecessary buts it's quite good fun.",5,3,7,9 April 2011
Shutter Island," The price of progress is such a pity
","great story, loved the book and the story carries the film but for me it just doesn't work as a movie, the book allows you to imagine the scenarios whereas the film has no choice but to force them on you. de caprio does a decent job as the confused and tormented ted daniels but memories of the beach came flooding back In his performance, can't help but feel he was miss cast for this pivotal role in the movie. a decent watch that will leave most baffled as they leave the theater, it's just a matter of interpretation really. The movie has it's moments in particular with the setting and portraying across to the viewer the feeling of being trapped with the island and the dark stormy weather which does good things for the film. However a better overall experience is to be gained by reading the book before watching the movie because it truly is a better read than a watch.",6,1,2,4 November 2010
Zombieland," Gives some real bite to it's characters
","Zombieland goes to prove that one of the key elements needed to produce a good movie is producing likable characters. It's premise is very simple, 99% of the the worlds population has been wiped out by this virus and the survivors are on a trip to LA with the bad ass Tallahassee (Harrison) leading the charge of this very well assembled cast. In addition to this there is an hilarious cameo role played by Murray that probably worth watching the movie for on it's own. The zombies obviously play an important part and contribute to scares and humorous moments but the beauty of this movie is that the four central roles produce the vast majority of good that comes from it. There's nothing wrong with zombieland, it's well acted, well directed and very funny and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Shaun Of The Dead when it comes down to zombie horror.",7,0,1,22 November 2010
WALL·E," One mans rubbish is another robots treasure!
","For a film consisting of an animated cast of a junk collecting and compressing robot with the vocabulary consisting of three to five words and his best friend the shy of words cockroach this excels. Pixar have produced a beautiful version of a broken down abandoned, rubbish infested planet earth that does have visually stunning backdrops which wall-e wiz's around tidying and collecting fun human memorabilia. The film starts in amusing fashion and continues to impress when eve a device that looks like it was created by apple is sent down to earth to scan for signs of life by the remains of human life that live on a super ship unaware of what life on earth was once like, and hope to find signs that life us now sustainable so they can return. Wall-E falls for eve and trys in many comic scenes to win her attention. Once wall-e returns with eve to the space station uninvited with proof of life on earth the film suffers for the first time as characters get a little lost and Disney and Pixar try to teach us some moral lessons in that we need to take more responsibility for our own existence. The film ends really well in typical Pixar fashion robots teaming together fighting against an auto pilot and various other robots that don't want the humans to return to earth. This is a brilliant heartwarming film by Pixar that sits well with the likes of toy story in terms of trying new things and continuing to make us laugh in different ways.",7,0,2,4 November 2010
