Blade Runner 2049," Why blame Ridley?
","Ok, I didn't care for the film, either. For all the boundless options a sci-fi future world holds, there's no action or imagination - just a few cool gadgets. The one thing I found funny, and this is more a critique of the reviews here than the actual movie, is how everyone is blaming Ridley Scot for basically the downfall of cinema. You have IMDb, but somehow didn't notice that he wasn't involved in writing, directing, or producing the film? Yeah, it's a boring, pointless movie, but the only connection Ridley has to the film is his involvement with the original 'Blade Runner'. 
As far as the actual movie, I watched it for free on HBO and still felt robbed, if nothing else, of 3 hours I'll never get back.",2,3,11,8 June 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," SOO DISAPPOINTING
","I'm a lifelong Spider-Man fan, and this is probably the worst venture of the whole series. I lost interested w/in about 15, 20 minutes.Nobody wants Miles Morales as the primary Spider-Man, but that's not even the reason this was so bad. It was just... STUPID. The 1970's TV movie w Nicholas Hammond was better.Plus, the entire story was already played out on TV (Ultimate Spider-Man?). It was just an unnecessary, unwanted, and poorly executed venture.",1,11,19,20 November 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," ONE good point
",At least there was no Zendaya as a discount MJ. That has to be the worst casting in the entire Spider-Man universe.,1,11,20,20 November 2019
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Has potential, but far from realized
","I feel like this COULD have been a pretty decent and enjoyable movie, but it just doesn't quite rise to its potential. Part of the problem (well, the main problem) is that Ben Stiller just isn't right for the part. Had someone else played the titular character, it could have been a really cute, quirky movie. I'm guessing he was cast only because he was also directing. Ben Stiller is just not likeable, and never made me root for the main character. I have to admit that I added a couple stars to my rating for two reasons: 
1) Paul Fitzgerald. He's a very talented, yet underrated actor, and would actually have been a much better choice for the main protagonist. He has the innate charm and likeability that would make you care about Walter. 
2) Adam Scott. He did a great job of digging in and showing range. He usually plays a kind of quiet, dorky, shy but likeable guy (e.g. Parks & Rec). This is the first role I've seen him in where he was so smarmy and... 'prick-ish' (for lack of a better term) that I just wanted to smack him, and was actually rooting against him. Shirley McClaine, of course, did a decent (if subtle) job, but everyone else was just kind of there. Kristin Wiig (whom I think is very talented) wasn't remarkable (good or bad), but that could be the script's fault. It's not necessarily a bad movie, it just doesn't seem to want you to care about any of the main characters. One good thing I can say about the film is that Ben Stiller didn't do his usual ranting, rambling improv schtick, trying way too hard to be funny (and not succeeding).Bottom line, if you're a big fan of any of the actors, it's a fine film to have on in the background if you're doing chores on a rainy day, but I wouldn't go out of your way to see it.",5,0,4,31 August 2018
Reservoir Dogs," How is this a classic?
","After not finding a reason to watch this the past few decades, I decided to watch it since it was on Showtime and there was nothing else to watch. I couldn't believe how disappointed I was.I didn't particularly care for Pulp Fiction, but at least it was original and somewhat creative. There just wasn't anything entertaining about Reservoir Dogs. The only thing I was surprised by was Tarantino's appearance in it (which would have not happened had he not written & directed it - I'm not sure how many people realize he's a failed actor).I'd heard enough about the film that I was prepared for the violence and gore, and while I didn't enjoy that aspect, it wasn't the reason I disliked the film so much. Although some of the language was a bit abrasive (the rampant use of the word in an early 90's film does seem... odd to say the least). It was just plain boring. The plot was thin and barely held together, and the ending was just completely unsatisfying.I just don't see anything about this film that would make any true cinephile consider this a masterpiece. It doesn't lend anything to the cinematic landscape of the genre or decade or film in general. The only people who would like it would have to be Taratino buffs (who are a breed of their own) and love it because it was his first big film - which apparently is a rip-off of an Asian crime film.Honestly, unless you're a hardcore Tarantino fan (in which case you've probably already seen it) skip it! Maybe it was a landmark in sheer amount of violence, but it's certainly not relevant nor does it offer any redeeming value.",2,4,11,9 September 2019
Parasite," Awful
","Really, one of the worst, most drawn out films I've ever seen. The people touting it as a 10 are pseudo-intellectuals trying to construct something that just wasn't there - like the amateur critics on here who think of themselves as legit film critics. I'm sorry, the film just doesn't deserve the hype or accolades, and most certainly not the Academy Award (even for foreign language film, let alone Best Film).I was expecting something deeply profound and artistic, and this just wasn't either of those things. This is a horrible example of trying to expand one's cinematic palate to foreign films, because there are wonderful foreign films out there. I'm guessing the people that liked this also thought 'Mother' was some sort of mind blowing masterpiece.",3,4,6,17 April 2020
The Matrix," Redefined science fiction
","I know that this is an older film, and the effects are kind of out dated, but at the time, it was absolutely revolutionary. Things like 'bullet time' were invented to be able to make the story come to life. It has inspired so many filmmakers; not to mention its influence on pop culture in general.It's a perfect blend of sci-fi and action/adventure (kung fu especially). Sure there are a few plot holes, but things like humans being used as batteries had to be changed to make it more accessible. Apparently the concept was originally to use humans' brains for their computing power, but the studios thought that would be too confusing for viewers.It truly was a game changer. The sequels definitely went in a different direction, and unfortunately the Wachowski's other efforts haven't lived up to the high bar set by The Matrix, but I can't say enough good things about this movie. Obviously no movie is perfect, but The Matrix is a fun, inventive, action-packed blockbuster of a movie.",10,1,2,28 May 2019
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Stupid
","Just an added example of how stupid the movie is... it starts out w Ricky Bobby as a kid, then goes to '15 Years Later', where you have Will Ferrell... at 39 years old. Meaning he would have been 24 in grade school/jr high... So, yeah TOTAL masterpiece.",1,0,3,10 November 2019
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Just not funny (if your IQ is over 75)
","The fact that so many people gave this a high score and herald Will Ferrell as a comic genius is a perfect example of why the rest of the world thinks the US is a joke and Americans are stupid. With people thinking this is a great movie, is it any wonder we ended up with a joke like Trump as president? I'm sure the same people who thought this was funny thought that Trump was a good idea.People complain about Hollywood churning out crap, but people lap it up, like they apparently did w this movie. As long as there are people dumb enough to buy tickets for tripe like this, Hollywood will continue to produce material for that demographic.I get that I'm not exactly the audience this film was targeting, but then, I'm actually educated.",1,0,5,9 November 2019
