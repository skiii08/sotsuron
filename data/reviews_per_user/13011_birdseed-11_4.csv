Blade Runner 2049," They just did more.
","Saw it last night, this new one just takes the tropes and devices of the original and extends them further. There is nothing really new and mind blowing, which was the fun part of the original.It is slow; be patient. And for all it's length it leaves gaps in the story that the viewer has to figure out himself.The acting is great, but the 'kooky characters' aren't nearly as kooky. And for some reason Agent K is a deeply pensive character. So the audience gets a lot of hard stares at the camera from Gosling, even when he's happy.It's a good movie, but you have to actively watch it. In each scene look for what is interesting. This is more of a thinker's movie than popcorn vapidity.",6,3,7,18 October 2017
Angels & Demons," portrays Catholics as imbeciles
","The only thing that successfully carried over from the book to the movie is the complete misunderstanding of Catholicism. The Vatican is not like corporate America. While that model is easy for Americans and atheists to digest, it is simply not true. I know a lot of priests and bishops. They aren't against science. I think we learned our lesson with Galileo, Darwin, etc. and don't argue about it too much anymore. (And as much as science will understand, there will always be a need for God.) The only thing that was vaguely Catholic, other than the settings and costumes, was the very end when the Cardinal thanks Langdon and explains that Langdon was called by God, even though he wasn't a believer, to get this straightened out. That was the Catholic attitude. The rest of it was Hollywood.Other instances of non-Catholic behavior: In St. Peter's square when the 'stem cell research' supporter is yelling at the nun that 'You are condemning sick people to death.' and she replies 'Man is not God.'. That is not the problem Catholics have with stem cell research. The issue is 'You have to kill babies to have enough stem cells to do your research.' This is not the forum for a science or religious debate so I won't go into it. I'm just saying 'Man is not God' is not the main argument Catholics make against stem cell research.Catholics don't believe in suicide. The end scene when McKenna self-immolates is completely ridiculous. No priest would think he is going to heaven just because he said a little prayer just before he killed himself. That's just ignorant.Even the supporting statements of Catholicism are very limited. When the head of Vatican security confronts Langdon with 'my church comforts the sick and dying and feeds the poor. What does your church do? Oh yeah, you don't have one.' He makes it sound like Catholicism is like joining the United Way. It's not. There are many more rewards than that. Those acts are just the fruits of our faith. Real Catholicism is about following the will of God, having a loving heart, trying to be like Jesus, and having the peace and joy of knowing that all will be well because you are following God's plan for you. From that we go out and comfort the sick and feed the poor, and many other ministries.I thought the movie clipped along at a pretty good pace and the riddles were imaginatively portrayed. But the film bounced from scene to scene a little too fast in an attempt to create a frenetic pace. And the death scenes were unnecessarily gruesome. I can't recommend this movie.",4,4,5,29 March 2010
Pi," Collage of great shot making
","This movie is best viewed as a collage of great camera shots. It is best understood as a movie used at film school to understand the affect of good shot making. Really the ideas for the camera placement and angles and the way the shots communicate the characters mindset are fantastic, perfect even in some cases.If you really understood mathematics you would see the hole in the Hassidic Jews request for a number of so many digits. But if you aren't comfortable with math, what little is presented could intimidate you. So from a mathematics standpoint, this movie appeals to no one.The acting is fantastic, especially with the camera mounted where it is in some shots. Sean Gullete, as Max Cohen, can really concentrate and stay in character. It was all very believable.All in all though this is a depressing story of a man living alone in Chinatown who struggles with his curse of being a genius. Again, this is a movie mostly for a film school class.",5,4,6,11 November 2011
There Will Be Blood," Awful
","I can't believe this movie received so much hype. It makes me think someone like Daniel Plainview, the protagonist (antagonist?) of the film, is in charge of the movie studios. Someone is using his guile to dupe us sheep into giving away our money for no good reason, namely this film.This movie should only be viewed by those who loved Upton Sinclair's novel 'Oil!', on which this film is based. The cinematography is excellent. Daniel Day Lewis is excellent, as usual. But the film is nothing more than a moving-picture-slide-show of the key scenes from Sinclair's novel. There is no coherence, rationality, or depth to this film. We never feel compelled to root for a sympathetic character. Granted, Daniel Plainview is a monster, but there should still be a hook in the film. There is none. The director relies on our patience, or resistance to just walk out, to hold us in our seat.This is a beautiful film but it is only for the extremely patient. One should also not be squeamish. There are scenes of very realistic violence and harsh emotional abuse.The only reason I don't give this one star is that it is watchable. (Keeping in mind that I have never been able to sit through Annie Hall.) A great book does not automatically make a great movie. See Angela's Ashes or Seabiscuit (speaking of a movie that is really just a slide show). Sometimes a book is great because of the great writing. Hollywood doesn't seem to get that. They didn't get it for this movie. That's for sure.",2,2,6,30 March 2009
