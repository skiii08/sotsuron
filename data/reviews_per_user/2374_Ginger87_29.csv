The Ring," Scary
",*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*'The Ring' I found to be one of the scariest films ever made.  I first saw it in theaters a week after it came out and it scared me half to death.  In fact I was eves covering my eyes during parts of it which I never did during any movie before.The acting in this film was really well done and the special effects were great.  They helped make this movie scary.  In my opinion the scariest part of the movie is when Noah sees 'the girl' coming out of the well after him. That freaked me out!I recently heard that a second film is being made and I'm looking forward to it and hope that it's as good as the first.  I also loved the spoofs of this movie on 'Scary Movie 3'.  They were hilarious.Overall I believe this was one of the greatest horror films ever made.
