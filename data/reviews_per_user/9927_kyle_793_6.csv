Ali," Not a boxing movie, a landmark film
","Well, if you went to Ali to see an boxing movie you might have been disappointed, but if you went to see a great film you hit the mark.  The hype was due.  A conglomerate of great acting, great direction, and a great story has made Ali a landmark film.  This film is socially important because it raises up one of the most notable and underappreciated figures of the twentieth century, Ali.  Many considered Ali just a boxer with a big mouth, but this film finally exposes him for what he truly was, one of the greatest civil rights leaders of our time.  The film makes subtle but amazingly-done comparisons between Ali and other civil rights leaders, notably Malcolm X, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and highlites Ali's influence with theirs. This theme is climaxed in the beautiful scene of Ali (Will Smith) running down streets in Africa with local chidren chanting his name.  At this moment in the film, we understand as viewers that Ali did not fight for fame or fortune, but he fought for his rights and the rights of all black people in the United States and the world.  No other film has exhalted Ali's influence in such a way.  It was beautifully done.  Ali will become one of my favorite films of all time, and I believe will be remembered years from now as the crowning achievement of both the main actor and the director.  I applaud their efforts",9,73,109,3 January 2002
Citizen Kane," just on look, and I knew
","Few directors have understood the complexities of film like Orson Welles. To him, lighting set the entire mood, the angle told the story, and the looks were dialogue.  Perfection was his goal, and no film ever got closer than Citizen Kane.  At once, enthralling, depressing, thoughtful, and uplifting, the greatest of this film is ineffable, its impact undeniable, its vision unforgettable.  This film changed making movies forever.  Every director that has made a film since has strived to be Orson Welles.  Every actor that has acted since has wanted to act like Orson Welles.  Every lighting designer, every cinematographer, every screenplay author, they have all wanted to be Orson Welles.  This film is what we measure all over films by.  No, it is not as action-packed as Star Wars, it is not as scary as Psycho, it does not use the digital technology of Titanic, but let us get one thing straight, none of those things are what films are about.  Film is about a story and how you tell it.  Nobody told it better than Citizen Kane.",10,0,1,3 January 2002
Finding Nemo," Where's the music?
","Being a fan of Pixar, I saw Finding Nemo on opening day, surrounded by a host of individuals whose years are mere fractions of my age.  Regardless, I was memorized by the film visually, I thought the emotional depth was well beyond what many past animation films have gone for, and I thought that it was one of the most entertaining films of any kind produced in recent years. My only problem?  The music.  It is not the score was particularly bad.  In fact, it was quite engrossing, but what I have come to expect from animation films is a type of sing-along, the modern American musical, and I thought that that was sorely missed.  Many will scoff at my request for this type of music in Nemo, believing that it would demeaning for such a good film.  But music does not lower the artistic level of such a film, indeed, for a film with this specific audience, songs can be the best way to bring individuals into the story and raise audience involvement.  I believe that a more traditonal animation soundtrack would have greatly increased the effectiveness and longevity of Finding Nemo.",8,0,0,26 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Visual Aspects
","IN today's world of computer technology, the 100 million easily built the cities, creatures, and effects in Lord of the Rings.  But clearly Lord of the Rings stands out, as a film, against the technology-ridden films we are embarrassed with today.  Most films are reliant on their computers, and therefore limited by them.  The strength of this film, however, is not found on its dependence on computer technology, but on its independence, leading to its most innovative use.  Indeed, Lords of the Rings stands out today was being unique because it relies heavily on the (old) tricks of the trade. Camera angles, miniatures, re-shoots, costume design, make-up, and the latest in computer animation all combined made this film to produce a visually stunning experience.    I was awed at the beautiful use of color throughout the movie.  For the first half-hour, as we are emerged in to the Shire, the greens and yellows of the hills are shot with amazing clarity and realism.  As the story line travels darker, so too does the film.  Many scenes that could not be created by hand, contained some of the best use of computer technology to date.  The scenes seem so real, the depth-perception so well done that I found myself in many of the shots on top of the high tower feeling like I was going to fall, a feeling I do not feel that often.  Indeed, I didn't know I was afraid of heights untill I saw this movie. The vision of this movie is surreal and it is extremely well done.  A monumental visual achievement.",8,0,0,12 January 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," asthetically pleasing
","Eyes Wide Shut is first and foremost a beautifully shot picture.  Great care is taken to make every shot pleasing to the eye.  The slow following of Tom Cruise throughout the movie (rather than keeping the camera stationary) is a wonderful technique that submerses the viewer into his character.  The colors are fantastic.  The angles extraordinarily complex and dramatically moving.  As for what the movie's about?  I don't know, for sure.  I think I know, but I don't think anyone knows for sure what this movie means.  I don't think even Stanley Kubrick knew when he made it.  But regardless, like most of Kubrick's work, this film will persevere through our time, and I imagine one day it will be raised to the height that it deserves, a beautifully complex film for all time.",7,0,0,25 February 2002
Born on the Fourth of July," Modern American Film At Its Best
","Amazing direction (Oliver Stone), amazing acting (Tom Cruise, et al.), and amazing story (Ron Kovic and the United States military during the Viet Nam war).  This alone sums up Born On The Fourth Of July, a modern classic. May it always be remembered as a great film.  Its stunning look at the Viet Nam War and social and political aftermath through the life of one person, played by Tom Cruise, must go down in cinematic history.  May writers, directors, and actors in this country forever have the courage to make films with such passion and such heart.  Watch it.  Watch it with your children (older ones).  Watch it with your parents.  Watch it in your classrooms. It will leave your soul searching searching.  America is the greatest country on the face of the Earth, and one of the reasons is because we have the ability to revisit, question, and atone our past like this film does.",8,1,3,3 January 2002
