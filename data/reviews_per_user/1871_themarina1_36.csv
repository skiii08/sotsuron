50 First Dates," At times funny but overall forgettable romance
","I was expecting a little more from this movie. I'm not sure what more but I felt a bit empty after watching it. Barrymore and Sandler usually have great on-screen chemistry but I though it was lacking in this flick. The story is pretty interesting, a girl who has no short term memory falls for a guy but can't remember him the next day. Some really funny performances here, particularly that of Sean Astin as Barrymore's workout crazed brother. Not the worst date movie I've ever seen but certainly also not the best. For classic Barrymore/Sandler action, watch 'The Wedding Singer'. It's a better choice.6/10",6,0,0,11 April 2004
Monster," Brilliant Performance makes this worth watching
","Oy, where to start! This life story is depressing to say the least. The product of abuse, Aileen was a truly disturbed woman. Charlize's physical transformation is remarkable (to the say the least) but the real catch in this movie is the acting. Every emotion and every action is portrayed amazingly by a truly talented actress. Hollywood movie this is but Hollywood story it's not. There are no happy endings here. As if her life hadn't been hard enough, Aileen finds herself in love with a manipulating, irresponsible girlfriend who does nothing to help. Truly sad and utterly depressing. A poignant look at a woman who suffered her entire life.8/10 A powerful movie, just be careful you don't go home and think on it too much...",8,0,0,29 January 2004
Memento," Outstanding
","This is absolutely, hands down, one of the most innovative films I've ever seen. I avoided reading any reviews of this for fear of learning too much and was I ever glad. I'll avoid to give any details here and highly suggest you just see this. Though the acting isn't stellar, the story and the manner in which it unfolds is brilliant. I didn't really understand what was going on until about half way into this movie (so much going on!). Make sure you see it twice though. I found that by the end, I'd forgotten what happened in the beginning because I'd been too busy trying to figure out what was going on in the middle. An excellent watch.9/10",9,0,2,29 November 2003
Underworld," Lacking Character Development but Otherwise Enjoyable
","As a serious fan of Vampire lore, I was interested in seeing the most recent treatment of that genre. I must say I was impressed, somewhat. I loved the action, though I agree it could have used more, I loved the costumes (who wouldn't?!) and I liked the characters. It would have been nice to see a little more character development and history. I am looking forward to the next installment...It would even be great to see a prequel....",9,0,0,30 September 2003
Finding Nemo," A good flick for the whole family
","From the very first scene this movie is great. The movie follows a clown fish by the name of Marlin who travels through the ocean in search of his missing son. Between meeting Doris, 3 'fish friendly' sharks, 150 old turtles along with many more, he finally manages to find little Nemo...but how does he get out of the tank??? Watch and find out!I gave this 9/10 purely for the laughs, animation and story. Definitely worth watching!!!",9,0,1,9 November 2003
The Mummy," It's not Indy
","This movie wasn't exactly Indiana Jones but it did have it's moments.
Rachel Weisz plays the meek librarian who wants to be an archaeologist and, in an interesting turn of events, finds herself hunting for lost treasure with the help of her always in trouble brother (played by John Hannah) and the treasure hunting American (Canadian Boy Colin Fraser).This movie provides some great special effects. Add in some hilarious moments and lots of action (fighting mummies and skeletons)and you have yourself a great little action movie. Thoroughly enjoyable indeed as long as you're not expecting Indy.8/10",7,2,2,9 August 2004
Troy," Mythical melodrama almost at it's best
","No one did this story better than Homer. We'll leave it at that. However, the movie was great for what it was, a movie. Sure it's based on the great classic and the 1000+ year old story, but no one ever said it was accurate. I do think that had the writers been closer to the original story (as told by Homer), we would have seen a much better movie but, Hollywood being what it is, great is never great enough.It's all here: romance, deceit, love, hate, revenge, death, tortured lover etc. I went in not expecting much but great costumes, beautiful people, amazing action sequences and mediocre acting. What I walked out with was a little more. O'Toole was amazing. He does deserve an Oscar for his portrayal of Priam. Sean Bean was also a notable supporting character. I never cease to be amazed by his roles. Though I've never seen him in a starring role he is never forgettable but rather a force to be reckoned with. Bana surprised me with his talents (especially after the sad, sad mess that was Hulk) but most of all, I was impressed by Brad Pitt. Though I've always believed him to have some talent, I was a bit concerned with how well he would pull off Achilles, the greatest warrior that ever lived. I wasn't prepared for his excellent portrayal of the doomed warrior.I did leave happy. I got more for my money than I had expected and this will definitely be a movie I will consider adding to my limited collection. If for nothing else, this is a good, entertaining movie. For me, it was a story of love and, indeed, honor.9/10",9,9,16,20 May 2004
Lost in Translation," Love in the far East
","I really enjoyed this film. It follows Bob, an American actor who's in Japan shooting an add. While there, he meets Charlotte, a young woman who's followed her husband on a photo shoot. This unlikely couple meet, have fun, are merry and in love....I think. This is a surprisingly emotional story with bouts of pure hysterics mixed in. At times, I was laughing so hard my eyes watered. Add in the wonderful look at Tokyo and the Japanese culture as seen through the eyes of two Americans and you have an amazing tour de force. Sofia Coppola has managed to create a wonderful film.9/10 I highly recommend it!",9,0,1,29 January 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," An almost great finish to a great trilogy
","And so it's over....for now. Over the last 3 days, there have been many not so great review of this movie. Ignore the critics and go see this. Though the story wasn't as great as it was in the first two, the movie was still better than most. I thoroughly enjoyed it all. From the extended 'kissy, kissy' scenes to the outstanding action and special effects, this was more than entertaining. Though it didn't answer all of the questions raised by the first two movies, it did manage to answer most. I gave it 8/10, mostly because I would have liked to see more mind bending chat.",8,0,0,8 November 2003
The Village," Another great movie from a master of suspense
","Truth be told, I've been a fan of Shyamalan since I first saw the '6th Sense'. I was hoping against all odds that this guy would have more than one good movie to give us and boy, has he ever. With every new story, Shyamalan roots himself in the psyche as a master of suspense. His films are scary in the the same way that the 'Blair Witch Project' was scary - by not showing us what we want to see. Joaquin Phoenix is always excellent and this movie was no exception. The rest of the all star cast including Hurt and Weaver provided some great performances but the show taker was Bryce Howard, a relative new comer from a line of Hollywood royalty. This is a fabulous film with a great story line that keeps you on your toes. I only wish Shyamalan had waited a little closer to the ending to show us the movie's hidden secret.8/10 A great excuse for curling up to that special someone",8,0,0,3 August 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Pretty funny action movie
","I liked this movie more than I thought I would. I have never been a huge fan of the Terminator movies (though I can appreciate the story and the FX) and so I wasn't thrilled about this rental, but....I just HAD to see it for myself. The story is a logical continuation of where T2 left off. Following suit, T3 tops the FX in T2 (the new bad guy is COOL)PLUS it's darn funny!!! I laughed through the whole thing! If you rent the DVD, check out the bloopers reel, it's pretty good!!!",7,0,0,17 November 2003
Van Helsing," An interesting foray into Universal's past
","It's been obvious over the past few years that Hollywood is lacking imagination. There have been more sequels, prequels, remakes and recycling of characters and stories in the past 5 years than I care to admit to watching. Though there are always good and bad, this one falls in the grey area, leaning towards the good.Van Helsing has been played by many a character but I like this one the best. The movie is chalk full of great animation, fantastic action sequences and some of the best costumes I've seen in a little while. Though the story is a familiar one, this 'version' does a good job of introducing a new generation to an old classic. Though I would have liked to see less 'monsters' in this movie (what will they work with next? Not too many left from Universal's old vault)it still managed to keep me interested through. I do think that this is a little on the long side and at one point I wondered when they were going to get on with the story. The story itself is nothing new though some of the 'new' details were interesting. An entertaining flick, this may be too much for those of us who watched some of these originals but it is a great intro for a new generation of movie watchers. Surprisingly, I found this very enjoyable and well worth my hard earned money. 7/10",7,0,0,10 May 2004
American History X," Brilliant
","This was the first time I ever saw Edward Norton on film and I've been a fan ever since. Not only was this a great story, beautifully told, it was also brilliantly acted. The story was believable and for that, scarier than any horror movie. A must see for everyone.9/10",9,0,0,29 November 2003
The Butterfly Effect," Impressive
","I was surprised by this film. I was expecting a cheesy, poorly acted flop but this turned out to be a well filmed, entertaining movie.Not only was the story interesting but Kutcher managed to pull off a good performance and probably his best to date as Evan, the troubled and tormented young man who returns to the past in an effort to change the future for the better. The director's cut, though long, managed to keep the viewer interested in the story until the very end. This is a smart, witty thriller that is well worth watching.8/10",8,0,2,9 August 2004
Before Sunset," Believable (though unlikely) love story
","Being that this starred Ethan Hawke, it wasn't hard to convince me to see this. I had heard some 'rumor' of this being a follow up to another film but I paid little attention.Truth be told, this is a brilliant film. I'm not quite sure which part is the best - the subtle acting or the casual conversation in which this film is written. From the very first instant, the audience is drawn into the story as a sort of 'fly' who happens to be listening to two long lost friends and lovers. Both Hawke and Delpy are so comfortable and casual with each other that you feel as though this really happened and is not just some movie. Hilariously witty dialogue and true to life observations, I couldn't help but laugh out loud. There is a definite passion that emits from both actors, creating an even stronger sense of belief in the possibility of this happening. Absolutely brilliant, this is one of the best films I've seen this year. Brilliant acting is only the beginning of the greatness of this film.10/10 A MUST see!",10,1,1,3 August 2004
The Pianist," Polanski at his best
","The Holocaust is always a cause of emotional trauma for me and so I avoided watching this movie. At last, I felt 'up' enough to see this over the weekend and was, once again, moved, gratified, and impressed (not to mention emotionally drained). A story of survival over adversity, this is the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish pianist, and his survival through the war. Adrien Brodie sucked in his audience and didn't let go until the final moments. His acting was superb and well deserving of his Oscar win. An excellent, inspirational look at one man's survival.9/10",8,0,1,15 December 2003
28 Days Later...," Why all the hype? More of a lame duck
","I don't understand what all the hype around this movie was about. The story had great potential but ended...badly. The first 20 mins of the movie (when our lead man Jim is trying to figure out what the heck happened) is the best it gets. Once he meets the other survivors, it all goes downhill. I must say I was impressed with the camera work and am still trying to understand why they decided not to use the 3rd alternate ending. It would have made the movie much more interesting. In the end, this was a great disappointment. I don't recommend this. 4/10 for the story (some of it at least) and the cinematography.",8,0,1,3 November 2003
City of God," Fabuloso!
","This is a brilliant story of 2 friends. The movie follows Buscape and Ze (played by Alexandre Rodrigues and Leandro Firmino), two youths that live in a favela outside of Rio de Janeiro. Although both boys grow up in the same place and under pretty much the same circumstances, Buscape become a photographer while Ze becomes the local drug lord, pretty much running the city. The story follows both boys through their lives from early 60's and into the 70's. This movie is impressive on a number of different levels. It's not only a great story of people but it's also a brilliant gangster flick incorporating everything including guns, drugs and gang war. This film works for a number of reason but, primarily, it works because it makes you feel for the characters. This outstanding story line is paired with a smart, witty script, great acting and some dazzling directing work. The package as a whole is brilliant.9/10 Well worth watching",9,1,4,3 August 2004
Hellboy," Another great comic book turns into another mediocre movie
","Hollywood has obviously ran out of fresh ideas and so have turned to the comic world for the next big hit. Hopefully they'll soon realize that this is going to get old and move on but, for the time being, I'll keep going to these movies and hoping for a good one among all the crap.Unfortunately, this wasn't it. Though the movie wasn't too bad, it wasn't the best I've seen. The story deviated, the love story was pushed but not believable, the characters shallow, disallowing for emotional attachment. The only salvageable thing here is the OK special effects (even these are at times pushed). This ended with a setup for a sequel. Let's hope that they manage to get together some decent writers to provide them with better material for the next one.5/10",7,0,1,11 April 2004
Coyote Ugly," A good time killer on a SLOW night
","Why was this called Coyote Ugly? Oh yeah, I almost forgot. She worked at the bar for like wha'? 15 minutes of the movie? I liked the idea for this flick and it could have been SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better but instead, it was a disappointment with some crummy acting, crummy story line and just bad everything. The only good thing about this movie is the guy. Who is that guy? (I'd look but I'm having internet problems). 5/10",6,0,1,5 January 2004
Shrek 2," They're all back!
","After avoiding watching the original for nearly a year and then being thoroughly surprised at how good it was, I was ready for laugh out loud comedy in the second installment.And yes, this one is funny too but not nearly as funny as I thought it would be. With pot shots at many recent blockbusters, I thought this didn't quite meet my expectations. Yes, it is funny and has some really hysterical movies but it wasn't as funny as I thought it would be.Banderas and Murphy are hilarious as expected but I wanted more from Ogre. The animation is fantastic but all in all, the comedy here leaves a little more to be desired. Still, this is a very entertaining movie and a definite must watch for fans of the original. Don't be fooled by the adds though, the first is still better.7/10",7,0,0,22 May 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Original and entertaining
","The beginning of this film had me wondering if I'd understand it. Seemed as though we'd been dropped in the middle of something big...but what? Once the opening credits began to roll things started making more sense. I don't want to give it away but this is a must watch. With vague overtones of another great movie (Memento), most of this is filmed in a backward sort of state and though a bit confusing, the mind does adjust. The performances by both Winslet and Carrey were excellent and clearly well thought out and practiced. Funny, sad at times and original, this is well worth watching at least once, if not repeatedly.8/10",8,0,1,23 March 2004
The Mummy Returns," Not the best follow-up
","The first of these wasn't a great film and this one fell further behind. Continuing from where the Mummy left off, in this installment, the body of the pries re-awakens and creates havoc.The first movie had the benefit of a new, interesting cast and a possibly good movie but this second installment had nothing going for it. From the beginning it was obvious that this was simply a sad attempt of banking on the success of the first film. They didn't even have the decency of giving us a new story, the just recycled the old one.What is left for us here is a movie full of nothing but special effects and, fortunately, the public is not yet dumb enough to accept this.5/10 This installment had nothing going for it other than the cast and some redone fx",7,0,1,9 August 2004
The Last Samurai," One of Tom's best
","It's not the greatest movie ever made, or even the best in recent years but it is the best this year. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had action, drama, history, romance (with no bad love scenes). It was touching, emotional and well acted. If Tom doesn't win the Best Actor Statuette, he will have been robbed. Again.Definitely worth seeing. Highly entertaining and action packed.9/10",9,0,0,6 December 2003
From Hell," Jack is back
","This is yet another rendition of Jack the Ripper's story but unlike some of the others, this is one that is very well done. With Depp as the interesting and intense police detective on the tracks of Jack himself.Highly stylized and brutally gruesome at times, this is an interesting look at what life may have been like with Jack on the loose. Depp once again pulls off a bizzare, yet likable man and Graham is great at portraying a streetwalker of the day. The sets and cinematography are also very good in this movie, adding a dark, stark look at the streets of London, adding to the feel of the movie.An entertaining if at times scary movie.8/10",9,0,1,22 May 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Excellent SciFi
","I think I'm biased about these movies. I saw this 6 times before the DVD came out. Not bad for someone who doesn't usually see  movies more than twice.....but I LOVE this. The continuing struggle between the humans and the machines gets better with each installment and I can't wait to see what culminates! MORE great action, MORE great fx, MORE great story....AND who could forge MORE Keanu???",9,0,0,3 November 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Forgettable
","This was so forgettable I watched twice before I realized that I'd already seen it. Pretty sad if you ask me.The second installment in the series, I really think the Potter phenomenon should have stuck to books but, marketing being what it is, I guess that's too much to ask. In this adventure, Harry and his friends get themselves involved with the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets which has been opened a second time and petrifying students all over Hogwarts.These kids are indeed good actors. Emma Watson in particular never ceases to amaze me. She's a great actress in the making. An entertaining family movie but do yourself and your kids a favor and read the books instead.5/10",5,0,2,7 June 2004
Shrek," Funny, funny funny!
","It's not often that you can sit and watch a great movie with your kids, one that works on two levels but this is one of the few that does this, and very successfully.At first, I really had no interest in this, what I thought, odd movie and did my best to avoid watching it for over a year. But, when the video was released, I did break down and rented it and am I ever glad I did. This is a great comic romp which both the kids and the parents can enjoy. Kids will laugh at the utterly funny story, characters and happenings while parents will get a good laugh at the throw back to some of their favorite flicks. Eddie Murphy is hilarious as usual and adds the most to this funny movie. Add the really great animation and you have a great watch for the family!9/10",9,1,2,25 May 2004
X2: X-Men United," Superheroes save the world...again
","I really enjoy these sci-fi action flicks, especially when they include my favorite characters. For this reason (and the fact that the first of these movies ROCKED!) I was expecting a little more from this. Instead of a good story line, we get a mediocre one which, thankfully, still makes for an entertaining watch. Here we see the introduction of some new characters (go Nighcrawler!) and a quick view of things to come (Rogue and Iceman seem to have made it to the 'grownups table'). Though not as good as the first, this was still entertaining and I can't wait to see what havoc Magneto will cause next!8/10",6,0,0,15 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Definitely worth the sore butt
","OK. So 4 hrs (after all the adds and the previews...) without a bathroom break break was really long. And yes, it was hot and crowded. Yes, the lineup was an hour and 30 mins long and yes, my butt was really, really sore. It was all worth it. What was started 3 years ago is over. Finally? No. I'm going to miss the excitement of seeing what comes next (even through I already knew) the bottom line is that this was a great finale to one of the greatest epics of our time. Go out. See it with your kids. Introduce them to movie making the way it should always be. Enjoy.10/10",10,0,0,28 December 2003
The Matrix," Excellent doesn't come close to describing this
","I LOVE this movie. I remember sitting in a theater many years ago (it seems longer than 4) and watching this for the first time. There was nothing but awe coming from the handful of people watching this with me (compared to the 350 that watched Reloaded with me). Now, over 20 viewings later, I love this all the more. Great story, excellent action, groundbreaking effects, mind and eye candy. Who can forget the philosophy class required to understand some of the intricacies of this movie? Did I mention Keanu and lots of black leather and plastic? (*I'm rolling my tongue back into my mouth now*) 10/10 did I say EXCELLENT?",10,0,1,3 November 2003
Cube," Low budget at its best
","What can you do with a small group of actors, one set and a small budget? Just watch this and you'll see. By far one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. Natali has really put himself at the forefront of Canadian mainstream movie making and set the bar high. Find it at your video store and prepare yourself to enter this maze or brilliant movie making.9/10",8,0,1,28 December 2003
Honey," Surprisingly entertaining
","Having the opportunity to see Alba on screen again was enough of a reason for me to rent this movie, even though the reviews had been less than wonderful. What I discovered in this cheesy lined, somewhat predictable flick was an entertaining mix of music and dance with a nice little 'feel good' story line. I can't wait for the Alba to be given an opportunity to really act. She has great potential but she hasn't yet been given the opportunity to display any of her talent (except her beautiful good looks - men want her and women want to be like her). All in all, the acting here isn't fantastic and the story isn't something we've never seen before but it does contain some really great dance scenes and some not so bad moments as well.7/10 An entertaining evening!",6,0,3,1 May 2004
The Great Escape," A classic
","I'm not a fan of watching old movies but the first time I saw this, I only caught the last 20 mins. It looked interesting enough and the next time it was on, I made a point of watching the entire thing and what a great movie this was. They don't make them like this anymore. This is a great story of survival. A group of POW's try to escape from a camp in Germany by building an underground tunnel opening just outside of the wooded area on the other side of the fence.As if the story wasn't good enough, this is one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen, James Garner...and the list goes on. Not just a great ensemble cast but one full of actors that can really act. Interesting in the story is the respect shared by the German general and guards and the POW's.This is a great classic and a must watch for movie fans, even for those of us who weren't conceived when this was made.8/10",8,4,7,17 May 2004
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Vampires done beautifully
","I absolutely love this movie. Maybe I am biased (I'm a huge fan of Anne's and I LOVE Tom), but still, this is a gorgeous movie. It's beautiful, well, acted and has a fabulous story. A must for all vampire fans and a good, entertaining movie.9/10",9,1,2,30 November 2003
Princess Mononoke," Who needs Disney?
","Disney was never great but now they can't compete. I had purchased this on DVD a little while ago thinking it was something else. This morning, nothing on TV, I thought I'd pop it in the player and WOW. A beautiful story of survival, friendship, love and honor. I wanted to cry at the end. To boot, the animation was excellent. A great watch for adults and children alike.9/10",10,1,3,28 December 2003
