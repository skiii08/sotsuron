Despicable Me 2," Lovable Mi(nions)..!
","Now i am just fresh out of a screening of the most adorable 'Despicable Me 2' here in Chennai and i feel like i have to write down a review to 'pusher' people to definitely watch this one ASAP.Although i would have to be honest and concede that it's more 'lovable Gru' than 'despicable Gru',i would be a fool if i said Steve Carell doesn't uplift his role with new-found enchantment;while keeping in touch with his usual loathing self,despite the fact that he loses his villainous demeanor and dons a much,shall i say,welcome hero.Come on we could all see it coming.!How else could the second installment have turned about...The lady character in Lucy mostly fills up the empty spaces with good wits yet the character itself tends to fizzle out after a promising intro..It's all understandable still because the tech crew has packed so much content into a 90 min flick that some children might fall out of it,you know..Having said all that,Despicable me 2 belongs right up there with the elites of animation movies like 'The Croods','Megamind' and the like...Just enough for everyone..Pure family entertainment... And NOW moving on to the best part of the movie - NO its not the 3 cutest girls in the world (the tiniest one is my favorite by far though ;but the premise of the whole sisterhood thing i thought was brilliant right from the word go),it is THE MINIONS...!Oh yes folks who enjoyed the first part know what i am talking about..It's almost like the screenwriters guessed the audience craved for more..This is the high point of the movie..Whenever the minions make an appearance,no matter how small they bring the biggest cheers to the audience hearts..So innovatively created;these so-called minions,the real superstars of this tremendously colorful animation world are the ones that keep the loaded film intact(whether they come in purple or yellow)..And special mention about the end which is just as awesome as the beginning,maybe even better.. Much highly recommended...for anyone above the age of 1 month..!ENJOY YOURSELVES humans...this flick is only gonna make your heart bigger and your body smaller..!",8,0,1,3 July 2013
The Impossible," It's the name that intrigues you the most...!
","As for the movie,it is the plot that feeds off the actors..Its been an awesome last year for Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper and it looks like this year is going to be no different..A packed storyline embellished on its course by the rising above-mentioned star duo and Eva Mendes sure seems enough to keep you on tenterhooks throughout the flick but somewhere along the ride things become distraught kept intact only by the solidness of Cooper and Mendes;one of whom might even be worthy of an Oscar for spectacular acting display..Eva Mendes is hot even when she is sad..She has given some real heart to the performance..While the same can't be said of the Hangover star,there is no way he doesn't play his conflicting cop/DA character to near-perfection.. Now moving on to Ryan Gosling...Man,he is nuts..maybe that's how he is in real life..A carefree,lover turned caring father @ bank robber..he plays his role to absolute perfection..Almost reminds you of his role in 'Blue Valentine',only better..This guy is so versatile you would think he could have donned Bradley Cooper's role even better than the latter..Now whether the same can be said for Bradley Cooper?;I am not sure..Which is exactly why it's a shame that Ryan Gosling won't be Oscar nominated because his role albeit short-lived is only a lead-point to this wonderfully written movie.. The only critique I have is that the film could have been shorter and although the two teens in the later part of the film have grooved well into their roles of drug-addicts(the address of the issue in such a flick is pretty smart i think),you can't help but feel this three part saga about ambitions and karma is a bit disjointed at turns and can bite you in the ass... But mostly it's a movie to be cherished,enjoyed and digested for the sheer brilliance of an intricate plot and tremendous direction form Derek Cianfrance..A must-watch for pure cinema lovers! Peace-out..!",8,1,4,22 May 2013
