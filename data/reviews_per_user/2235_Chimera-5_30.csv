The Blair Witch Project," NOT original and definitely not good!
","What a crock! This 'innovative' film is POUND FOR POUND a ripoff of the FAR SUPERIOR Cannibal Holocaust and these stupid kids should be ashamed of themselves! This poser film was just flat out NOT scary and beyond the realms of boring! I would find more excitement in watching water freeze!Seeing a bunch of white trash yell and swear at each other for 87 minutes is not my idea of a good time! You would have to be lobotomized to see anything redeeming in this film (or be a fan of other wanna-be horror film as Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer)! If you enjoyed this garbage, you've obviously never had the pleasure of seeing what REAL horror is!",Null,0,0,21 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A movie without flaw, just imbecilic viewers.
","Okay, I've heard every possible reason for not liking this movie, from 'the plot, acting, and dialogue sucked' to 'Jar Jar annoyed the hell out of me' and would like to put my own insight into this. I've always been just a casual Star Wars fan (always owning just the trilogy and never merchandise), but as film production major, the technical superiority of this latest installment raised my awareness of just how imaginative and awe-inspiring films can be.First of all, this is a sci-fi movie, NOT a Broadway play. It's highlights ARE SUPPOSED TO BE the special effects, the sounds, and the camera work. If you didn't know ahead of time that the film DOES NOT EMPHASIZE witty dialogue, Shakespearean acting, and plot twists every inch of celluloid, I would like to suggest getting a CAT scan. You guys who bash the film for the reasons I mentioned previously have arguments that are a)totally invalid, and b)completely bogus. That's like criticizing John Elway for not being good at basketball or pole vaulting! You're trying way too hard to dissect and analyze the movie instead of kicking back and ENJOYING it like all decent bipeds do. It's the same thing that happened with Godzilla in 1998. People trashed it for reasons the film was never meant to touch up on. 'Man, did that plot and acting suck!'. Gee really numbskull, what did you expect from a film about a 200 foot lizard stomping through New York??? As if the previews weren't enough of an indication that it was strictly a sight-and-sound driven film! Would you skydive without a parachute even though the odds of survival are slim to none? No? THEN DON'T ACT SURPRISED WHEN A SCI-FI FILM LACKS ELEMENTS IT WASN'T MEANT TO EMPHASIZE STRONGLY IN THE FIRST PLACE! Do you hear anybody saying the special effects in Pulp Fiction sucked or the action sequences in As Good As It Gets sucked? Certainly not. Therefore, logic dictates not wasting you time on what on what I just said in all caps above. If you're whining about how bad the story to this film is, perhaps you're just too stupid to understand it. IT'S NOT a sequel to Return of the Jedi! It's purpose was to set up events for five other movies. Oh, but you were too upset that the plot wasn't what you expected to realize that...And for people who waste time in chatrooms and guestbooks dogging Jar Jar Binks, I have three words for you: GIVE IT UP! Your efforts to sound macho and brash just sound like a total scam. Rumor has it George Lucas said he will be in the next two films and he addressed all you dorks to 'get over it'. Indeed, get over it! If you can't handle it, don't bother with the next two movies. YOU'RE MONEY ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM!Finally I want to say that in my humble opinion the 2-on-1 lightsaber duel in the film is the most technically awesome film sequence ever. What do I base that upon? The zooms, the stunts, the music, the wide angle shots, the backgrounds, the camera trickery, on and on and on. I challenge anybody (film buff, critic, even film scholar) to come up with something else from another film that can be anywhere up to par with the magic of this scene! Of course, a lot of it was done with the aid of computers, but so what! If you've got the power, use it!If you want to put your 2 cents in anything I just ranted about, be a man and email me directly instead of posting your comments in this guestbook which I seldom if ever browse.",10,0,0,24 September 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," What's everybody's problem?
","Okay, there's clearly something WRONG with our society when E.T. is #193 on the top 250 and The Matrix is #32. I know it isn't 'cool' or macho to admit you like E.T. because it's old and supposedly it's a kids movie, but you guys are just being way too hard on yourselves. This is an American masterpiece, not some jazzed up 2 hour techno video starring Keanu Reeves. Ah well, I guess we all just have to do whatever we can to fit in and not risk anybody's disfavor, right?",10,2,4,31 July 2000
The 13th Warrior," Damn good!
","Good action, good effects, INCREDIBLE costumes and sets (those bear skulls on the spikes, ickers!) make this the surprise flick of Summer '99. I enjoyed it thoroughly and plan to snag the DVD. But why oh why the ridiculous name change? I thought it sounded great as a zombie movie title!",10,0,0,27 January 2000
Terminator Salvation," This franchise is finally 'DONE-DONE-DONE-DA-DONE, DONE-DONE-DONE-DA-DONE!'
","Unbelievably stupid video game of a movie! You just know Hollywood is reaching when they have to take a series like this and try to 'resurrect' it by watering it down to PG-13 (Alien vs. Predator, anyone? Another two franchises where every shred of decency became a video game-like mess!) to reach a 'wider audience' (as in kids) and sell merchandise. A rapper and a hot girl as protagonists? Seriously?? Wow, you reek of desperation, Hollywood! McG, a music video director? Oh man, that's just the icing on the crap cake! Why is it that whenever they need a Caucasian protagonist for an iconic role, they pick Christian Bale? I guess he's the Caucasian equivalent of Samuel L. Jackson when they need someone of a certain race to fill a cookie-cutter role.AVOID!!!!!!",1,25,57,22 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Seriously, does it even matter if it's good or not?
","What, as if every female in the country ISN'T going to see it at least twice, just because 'he's' in it? And are they REALLY going to not like it? Nope. Just like how hardcore Star Wars fans forced themselves the like the prequel trilogy on principle alone, same applies here. Of course it's boring, long-winded, ridiculous and convoluted! The first one wasn't a 'good' film by any stretch of the imagination, but it was entertainment and well heck, there really aren't any other pirate films to compare it to. After making a bazillion dollars, they decided a trilogy was somehow needed and they have the actor who could sell used condoms in it, so why not? Again, it doesn't matter in the the slightest, this is a cash cow that Disney is going to milk drier than the southwestern United States! DUH! YO HO, YO HO, A HARDCORE SUCKER IS YOU!",1,6,8,25 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Long-winded, convoluted, overly self-indulgent, yet still entertaining.
","I'm going to start by saying that the main gripe I have with all three films is how EVERY SINGLE female in the films is extremely attractive, and how the camera loves showing close ups of them screaming in the most random and pointless ways. What, so if we don't live in New York, we don't have any prayer of knowing what hot women really are? Wow, guess our lives suck! Why are the female scientists conducting the experiment Sandman-to-be 'stumbles' upon so hot? Give us a break already, you are trying way too hard Sam and it just makes you looks idiotic! Anyway, the film is way too long at 2 hours and 20 minutes for the ADD-laden and exhausted from being overworked and having too many children American audiences of nowadays, so they should have trimmed it by, oh, 45 minutes and saved themselves $100 million in budget anyway. The action sequences are way, way over the top and blindingly fast at times, thank the maker they just don't have the annoying 'oontz-oontz-oontz' techno music of The Matrix films. Three villains in one films? Three words, Sam; BATMAN & ROBIN.Sam just loves showing how 'diverse' New York really is, I think these films have more Asians in them than any film made in an Asian country! Oh Sam, you're so cute for a Democrat! Please go sing in a Southern Baptist church with a faux accent like Hillary! Why did you make Peter emo, Sam, when he turned 'dark'? Would you have done the same two years from now when emo inevitably crashes and burns like all other great American trends and nobody admits to adhering to it anymore? I doubt it! Boy, Harry Osborne sure can take a lot of beatings over and over again and not end up dead for a guy with no powers, just fancy equipment! Villains should be evil, Sam. Not guilt-ridden (you are a Democrat, aren't you!), not having any hidden agendas, not just 'needing a chance'. Make them detestable and ruthless instead of neo-hippies with muscles.Speaking of, Topher Grace was a horrible choice. Sure, he's recognizable and I suppose attractive to females, but he's skinny. And too boyish. You needed someone with a bodybuilder physique and a bit more dynamic. You might have to look beyond Hollywood for this, but it's not impossible. They got more than enough massive Caucasian dudes to star in 300, for crying out loud! It's entertaining. It's long, has some absolutely deplorable dialogue (gee, here's Aunt May in another scene, what liberal parables will she dish out this time?), and is WAAAAAAAY too MTV-poppy like its predecessors, but hey, it's another film with a classic superhero. It's not Superman Reuturns bad, and it's not Batman Begins great. I'll put it smack-dab in the middle. 7 out of 10. I'm feeling charitable today.",4,6,9,8 May 2007
Zodiac," Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...odiac!
","Boring. Nothing happens. NOTHING! If you're a David Fincher martyr, you'll make yourself like it regardless. No amount of reviews will be able to sway your opinions. Over two and a half hours??? What was gained from that, other than making it dreadful to watch in one sitting? Hence, I broke it up into three nights at about 45 minutes a pop. It's really hard for it to hold your interest at all. Here's a helpful hint - watch it with subtitles on. The dialogue is also way too San Francisco local and the names of too many cities, lakes, streets, counties, and buildings are mentioned too fast and too often that it will make your head spin. Some cool fashions and set design to recreate the late 60's and 70's, that about the only merit this film had. Other than that, let's just say I'm glad I borrowed it from my neighbor instead of spending any hard earned money dragging through this!",1,59,102,20 December 2007
Sleepy Hollow," Was on a roll, till last 30 minutes.... ::SPOILER::
","Awesome scenery, great score, nice stunts....this movie has all that. The story most of us are familiar with, thanks to Disney, so no point in running it down. However, when Burton insists on going astray with the whole 'sold my soul to Satan' deal with the stepmother near the end, I shook my head in pity. I'm tired of these movies interwoven with religious themes!!! Devil this, devil that. Gimme a break! Ah well... Rating: THIS close to a 10, but the above mentioned flaw just had to hit below the belt - 8/10",8,0,0,21 February 2000
The Beach," UGH! Zzzzzzzzz......
","Man, I can't believe they crammed all that boring hullabaloo into 2 hours! It seemed like an aeon! Did this movie remind anybody else of Fight Club (horrendous as well), as far as the narration and cinematography goes? What awful music throughout the whole movie too! I HATE POP MUSIC! Can no producer arrange for a score to be conducted these days??? Why do they always turn to MTV??? ::SPOILER:: When they chief thug says at the end 'If I cannot sell the dope, my family won't eat', why would he not just sell a few million dollars worth from the get go so his family would be set for life??? Hey, maybe he was high!Rating: a VERY generous 3 out of 10",3,0,1,12 February 2000
American Sniper," It's really nothing special; good but FAR from great.
","Okay, I didn't serve, so I'm not going to pose like I know what Iraq was like and pull the 'I was there!' card. I do, however, really like historic films in general. The attention to detail in the film was good, but then again you should expect this from someone the caliber of Clint Eastwood, so it's hardly surprising. I'm not sure how much of the film was factual, but my issue was how silly a lot of the film was. He sees the bombings of the US Embassies in Africa (before 9/11) and THAT motivates him to give up his cowboy life and enlist as a SEAL? Really?? Can anybody else under The Sun relate to that? It just seemed ridiculous, 9/11 would have made more sense as his impetus. Right when his wife calls him to say 'It's a boy!' an intense battle breaks out? Wow, the insurgents must have know with their psychic powers that his guard was down!Coincidentally meeting a maimed solider from his platoon in a mechanic shop in Podunk, Texas? Of all the luck! There was only one line of Arabic subtitled THE ENTIRE FILM and there were many lines that seemed important to the plot point in the scene. This was just laziness on Eastwood's part. Overall a well-made film with a few things that made me cringe. It does move fast for being just over two hours and covers a long span of time in Chris Kyle's life. I definitely prefer Zero Dark Thirty and The Hurt Locker over this, still.",5,9,29,20 January 2015
American Pie," YAY MTV!
","I just LOVED this movie! It is the funniest and sickest and most shocking film I have EVER seen! Funnier than The Pink Panther! Sicker than Cannibal Holocaust! More shocking than Salo! It is a MASTERPIECE! I loved the MTV-pop music ridden soundtrack! Far better than the score to The Empire Strikes Back or Conan the Barbarian anyday! I also love vinyl pants and butterfly stickers on my car and Chinese tattoos on the back of my shoulder! I just got myself a leopard purse and a skin tight leopard shirt! I just put on My Dave Matthews Band CD right before I typed this! Off to the fraternity house I go!Stereotypes abound! Obviously, the only sort of biped a film like this would appeal to. I can't wait for 2 more years to pass by, when all the 'stars' of this movie join the 'out' crowd of trendy cinema like Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald.... Cyclical, isn't it? >:)",1,8,19,24 January 2000
Pitch Black," Awesome, slam-bangin' sci-fi romp!!!
","Woah! What a rush! This movie met all my expections and took them straight through the roof! What really shined about this movie was it's awesome use of camera work, I hope other high-octane directors take notes from this! If you need your early 2000 sci-fi fix, you can't go wrong with this! If you are one of those cappucino people that criticize everything with special effects, stunts, and it's own real orchestrated score I would not recommend wasting your time on this since you're already predispositioned to dislike it. You should stay home and watch American Pie and Cruel Intentions for the tenth time. Man, that Vin Diesel sure is a BAAAD boy! I hope his career soars from here! Ben Affleck, you have met your match for the sexiest man alive!My vote: If you go to ENJOY this movie and not behave like a whiny critic, like you should all genre films, you'll see a 10/10 film, I promise!",10,0,0,19 February 2000
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," 'EVERYBODY GET DOWN!'
","WAS THERE EVER ANY DOUBT!?!?!There is NOTHING better this year, so far or to close it out. The King is back to reclaim his throne, and nobody is going to tell him he's too 'old' or 'tired'! The naysayers must have their perennial foot in their mouths by now! Don't miss it, and bury The Matrix sequels deep and fast! You don't have to be so trendy and force yourself to like them. Really, it's okay!ABSOLUTE 10 OUT OF A RESOUNDING 10!!!!!!!!",10,3,5,7 July 2003
The Patriot," Good stuff!
","Masterfully directed and acted. Great character development. Awesome score by John Williams (as always). God, I feel sorry for all those people who opted to see Perfect Storm instead! They should ask for refunds and put that money in The Patriot's box office take instead.",10,1,3,3 July 2000
Face_Off," Ohhh man!!! Why oh why is this so popular???
","I hated this when it came out, and now that everybody who thinks they know action movies is worshipping it I DESPISE it! What a sellout Woo has become! He may as well direct music videos or Pepsi commercials! I loved his Hong Kong stuff, very brutal, fast paced, but this attempt at 'dark' action (a bunch of pretentiously placed religious symbols) starring a few comedians trying to be hardasses is the sorriest excuse for an action I have ever seen! WHERE IS THE HUMOR? American action films (like the classics with Arnold, Bruce Willis, and Eddie Murphy) are monumental for their one-liners, but this was completely devoid of any! If it was cast better, had even an ounce of humor, and that ridiculous fight scene at the end was cut in half, it would have been much better. Sorry Woo, this just doesn't appeal to your classic fans or die-hard run n' gun film buffs! It ties with Con Air as the biggest joke of 1997!Rating: NEGATIVE 1 out of 10    >:)",1,2,5,21 February 2000
Independence Day," What's not to like???
","Remember the posters 6 months before the release? Remember the previews during the Super Bowl? Remember how long you waited in line and how packed the theater was opening day? Remember the audience 'ooohing', 'aaahing', screaming, and cheering? Remember the exhiliration and astoundment you felt as it ended? I sure do. And it was one of the best times I've ever had for a night out on the town. And it didn't cost 0 or involve getting drunk. That says alot. This came out the summer I had graduated high school. It was the second biggest highlight of 1996 for me. Oh, if this young heart could talk...Rating: A monumental, romanticizing 10 out of 10.",10,23,34,20 February 2000
Ghost Rider," A comic book film, plain and simple!
","I don't understand why some people even have a pulse. What, you expected Gone With the Wind or Braveheart??? Jesus Christ! This is based off of a comic, yes, one with a ridiculous story to begin with, so obviously it will have a bit of silliness to it and it might not make for a 'good' film, but it was plenty entertaining and true to its roots. So don't come in here like a film snob poser critic and be a cool guy with nonsense like 'awful story!', 'bad acting!', or 'dumb plot!'! Go sip your lattes and do your yoga Mr. or Mrs. Wannabe Artist, there's no reason for you to be seeing this film in the first place!!! But hey, I'm sure they appreciate that you donated your money to its overall gross! :)",8,5,7,21 March 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Very pleased!
","Oh stop complaining about not 'developing' the characters, they already did that for 5 hours over the course of 2 films (at least the key characters, so what about the minor ones?)! It has good action, was very fast paced, and overall was very satisfying! MUCH better than Superman Returns, sorry if you have a Superman tattoo on your body! I could justify a fourth film, no more beyond that. Four is VERY much pushing it in a series. If they wait a few years, it can be very much anticipated by the public and will likely be a success. Spin-offs, I don't know. We all saw how well Elektra did. Granted, this is of a different caliber, but I can't get too excited no matter who the character is. We'll just have to wait and see!",10,2,3,1 July 2006
I Am Legend," Empty and hollow.
","Many, many years ago, this was supposed to have been a James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger film. That evidently fizzled, and somebody though The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air would be good here (probably the same idiot that made him an action hero in the first place). It's not so much that it's Will Smith's fault the movie's just wasn't entertaining in the slightest, it's more like it isn't developed well enough and you neither care no empathize with his character. You almost find yourself rooting for the zombies, who look like they walked out of a Shrek film, the CGI is that horrible! How hard was it to put makeup on some actors and only use CGI for the stunt sequences?? Seriously, there's no need use a CGI character for a close-up of a zombie shrieking! You could have put plenty of New York's homeless in makeup and given them a great working opportunity, and it would have been much cheaper! The story doesn't develop; it's just ANOTHER 'New York in peril' story like all the rest of them. For once, I actually find myself wishing a movie was longer so it could have been more fleshed out. Much as you can't just put Johnny Depp's face on an awful film and think everybody and anybody will like it just by default of his association with it, same goes for Will Smith!",1,3,7,23 December 2007
Coyote Ugly," Heck of a scam, Mr. Bruckheimer!
","Oh man! So I take it all the snazzy rock video-like trailers with women dancing on top of a bar was a way to get straight males thinking they'd go to this movie and see lots of boobs and maybe even a little female on female lovin' (their lamest media forced fantasy), BUT.... with a PG-13 rating clearly you can't get away with much so MAYBE, just maybe there'll be a little hooter action....Nope, sorry guys, you were misled and scammed out of $8 but as long as enough of you cram the theater the first 2 weeks hoping to see a little somethin' the studio will have already made it's money back. Haha how pathetic. Avoid this movie even if your worst enemy tells you it sucks!",1,3,5,19 August 2000
Transformers," An embarrassment!
","I'm not going to say 'I'm a huge fan' or 'I'm a child of the 80s' because all that is irrelevant. A bad film is a bad film, straight up! Why does a Transformers film need stupid teenagers who wear band shirts running around trying to get laid? WHY? What does it add to the story, other than crude jokes and an excuse to tilt up and down some hot chick's midriff? How about NOTHING! This film should have just been Transformers and the military, that's what we want to see, not bodily fluids being unleashed and cheap sex references so MTV-martyrs can get a laugh! Why all the GM advertising? Are the kids who are going to bug their parents to buy them all the toys going to buy cars after the movie ends, too? Good lord! So Megatron can survive deep space, which is more frigid than we can imagine, but he can't sustain himself in a glacier? Wow Bay, you are so talented! Ever notice a similar theme in every Michael Bay film, that of a Caucasian loser (except the Bad Boys films) trying so hard to score with a few action sequences thrown in? I'm officially boycotting any film with his name attached to it for life. I had my doubts about this, and sure as heck, they manifested before my eyes!",1,7,17,21 August 2007
Men in Black," Nice and fast-paced, just too damn short!
","Good FX, some funny parts, silly, entertaining comic book action, all in 90 minutes! Kinda leaves you feeling...empty at the end. I definitely want more. Sequel, anybody?Rating: ALMOST a 10, but not enough duration to warrant such. 8/10",8,0,0,21 February 2000
Pulp Fiction," Zzzzzzzzzzz...
","...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!! Oh man, I will NEVER understand the appeal of this. Pointing a gun at somebody, cussing for 5 minutes, pulling the trigger, walking up to somebody else and doing it again for an aeon-like 2 hours is not very entertaining to me! There was NOT ONE stunt in this movie, and the camera angle never changed! And just when you think it's about to end, nope, it HAS to keep dragging on....and on....and on. I feel like a noose was removed from around my neck when the credits FINALLY rolled. Why everybody has the poster, the soundtrack, and the bumper sticker on their car is beyond me. Then again, thank the maker it didn't win Best Picture!Rating: A much-deserved, exhaustive NEGATIVE 1 out of 10",7,11,31,23 February 2000
Titanic," Here we go....
","Well, I'm a Star Wars fan so naturally I'm going to hate Titanic. Yep, I gave it a 1 out of 10. All I have to say is rerelease Titanic in theaters for it's 20th anniversary and we'll see if can make $130+ million dollars in that run alone, like the Star Wars Special Edition did. That will/will not have a lot to say about the long-term value of this 'epic'.",10,2,6,20 February 2000
X2: X-Men United," Like Comparing Empire Strikes Back to A New Hope
","Obviously the first film was just a testing ground to see if the critics and public would take to an X-Men film. With the success the first one had, they went ahead and gave the sequel a much larger budget which is absolutely necessary in a comic book to film translation of this scale. It's as good as you've heard - don't even sit and ponder it, just go and have a great time. And then you can go and flock like the rest of the cattle to the trendy and pretentious Matrix sequel.",10,0,0,10 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," WHY OH WHY IS THIS SO POPULAR?!?!?!?
","I just DON'T get it. What on Earth is so 'spectacular' about this??? It was more of a sedative than anything else! It ended too fast and it felt like there was so much to it missing/unexplained. The PG-13 rating also hurt it alot (obviously it got rated as such because it revolved around, well, a kid!) because it put a stranglehold on what they could/were willing to do with the film. It was obviously scenes were missing from a more detail, R-rated cut. THIS IS THE DIRECTION HORROR MOVIES ARE HEADED IN??? Oh man, first Scream, the I Know What You Did Last Summer, now this???

The Matrix," I despise this film more than anything else.
","Why this is so popular absolutely baffles me. It only beat The Phantom Menace for best special effects because of politics, to show that George Lucas 'supposedly' doesn't have so much clout. How anybody can get off on a bunch of skinny dorks in S+M outfits beating each other up with trick photography while techno music constantly plays in the background is beyond me. This is the MTV generations' wet dream, that much is obvious. Comparing it to Blade Runner is trying way too hard. And those of you trying to make something religious out of it, this is all I have to say: get a life and get educated. You just want to draw attention to yourselves. Here's hoping a piano falls on the Wachowski Bros. before the next two films are made.1/10. You got a problem with it, too damn bad.",7,10,26,16 May 2000
The Simpsons Movie," They're STILL dragging out this desperation?
","Wow, could a show possibly be on more borrowed time life support?? It's funny that SOOOOOO many people on here say that this film should have come out ten years ago, when it actually would have mattered and could have possibly been funny, because I was thinking the exact same thing! What does that tell you? People have too much emotional attachment to the show to admit that this film is awful. They mindrape themselves into thinking anything and everything with the Simpsons' faces plastered on it is good, much like female fans of Johnny Depp do. If the film was 90 minutes of the Simpsons sitting on the couch and blinking their eyes, they would say 'oMg BeSt MoViE eVeR!'. How pathetic! Yes, it's been said already many times, but I'm thinking it so I'm saying it; it is straight up a 90 minute episode of the godawful past 11 seasons. Cheap and forced jokes, bowel movement references, lots of obnoxious loud noises, and just plain lame, unfunny nonsense. Topical humor that will be outdated in a few short years, pointless celebrity cameos and references, and anything else catering to the modern pulse. Too bad the generation after us won't relate to any of the humor so that damns the film into not being timeless at all! Hmm, how many borrowed clichés from the show did we see? Marge threatening to leave Homer, Springfield on the brink of disaster, an angry mob, the Simpsons on the run, Homer falling in love with something not human, discord between Bart and Homer, Lisa falling for a boy... I doubt that's all! Desperation has replaced, dignity, guys. Force yourself to like this all you want, you're just embarrassing yourselves! Another poster referred to the type of people who put everything else on hold (like cutting their plans short) on Sundays to watch the horrible new episodes of the show as 'Simpsons zombies'. I'll take it a step further and say 'Simpsons martyrs', as the word martyr is more jarring to Western culture with this so-called 'war on terror'. Seriously, why not martyr yourselves for a cause more worthwhile, like say stopping the clubbing of baby seals or the shoddiness of Jaguar since Ford took over?All you die-hard fans who force yourselves to continue liking this misery should go and form Simpsonsbollah!",1,27,45,21 August 2007
