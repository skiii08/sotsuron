Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not a great movie on its own, but a great Star Wars Episode.
","Despite (or perhaps because of) some corniness, this movie is definitely on par with the other movies in the series. As long as you aren't spending hours in line, you don't have to be a huge Star Wars fan to enjoy the film. A little background (foreground?) on the characters is good to have, but not essential. See it on the big screen.",8,0,0,21 May 1999
