Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Stupid
","This movie is a sham and stupid. Simply stupid. Sure I laughed...I laughed because I felt uncomfortable. The movie has had fantastic marketing, guerilla marketing, but if you don't buy into the premise that Cohen really did these things, then it's just bo-o-o-ring. And some of the images are images I'd rather not have in my head. What is America coming to when this is one of our most popular movies? A sad remark on our juvenility, our lack of subtlety, our overall lack of taste. Save your money. Well, if you liked Dumb and Dumber or Jackass, or if you are 13 year old boy, Borat may appeal to you. And the rodeo horse falling down in the trailer? That is a stunt horse, Gold Nugget, trained by the rodeo owner's wife, Lenore Wade, of Imperial Rodeo Productions. Which means the rodeo owners were paid ahead of time to make the horse fall.",1,14,30,11 November 2006
