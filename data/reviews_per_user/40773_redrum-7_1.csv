The Blair Witch Project," At Last.
","Finally a movie that has lived up to (and surpassed) my expectations. It seems every movie I see lately is a let down. This is the first movie that has really scared me since I was 10. I ran from my car to my house when I got home from this movie, because my mind was still in the woods with the Blair Witch.",10,1,2,21 July 1999
