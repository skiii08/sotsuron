The Blair Witch Project," I got two words for you....
","Hey, college students, got two words fo you:  CELLULAR PHONE.  I make a few amateur movies here and there and NEVER go on location without a cellphone. Ugg, this had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.  Who does a documentary and doesn't bring a steadycam.  My $288 stabilizes an image better than that when running on beach rocks.  I just got really annoyed at the foul language and actually found myself yelling at the screen.  Think about it....the epitomy of Heather's obsession, she videotaped herself washing her hands in the stream....doh!  The ending was neat though, pretty creepy stuff...even though I think Josh killed them and went to Sweden or something.  Think about it....",Null,0,1,17 January 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Good, The Bad and the Ugly
","Let me get two things perfectly clear before I begin.  First, I am NOT nor have I ever been an Elijah Wood fan, second, I am writing this review while HBO is playing 'Battlefield Earth.'  I am aware that I should turn it off while attempting to write an objective review, but alas, I am lazy.  Now, onto the good stuff.I believe I am safe in saying that this movie is setting the standard in terms of what an epic should be.  It has a few minor flaws, but nothing that detracts from it's brilliance.I could go on and on, but chances are, you've already read everything there is to read on this film, so just pointers:The Good:1. As I said, I'm not an Elijah Wood fan, but he does a fine job as Frodo.2. In terms of make-up: Spectacular.  I didn't even realize John-Rhys Davies was in the movie until I got home later.  Nuf said.3. Christopher Lee is absolutely the scariest actor on the planet, bar none.4. I'm glad Viggo Morteson has finally got a good role.  Aragorn was always my favorite character.  I mean he was ok in 28 days, but this is better.5. The acting is top-notch.  Everyone was really on.  I'm going to assume they kept their level of focus throughtout the entire filming.6. The locations were gorgeous!The Bad:1. The fight scenes are absolutely dreadful.  It's mostly shot in close-up, like in Gladiator.  You never get a feel for psychology (always important to me).  However, the visuals are still spectacular.  Only a minor drawback here.2. Can't think of a number two.The Ugly:1. Orcs and their cousins2. Hobbit Feet - Gotta be a source of infection3. The Balrog - Sweetness!  Looked like a mean old cigarette.  One of the coolest CGI characters ever.  Too bad it was so dark, but it needed to be, I guess.  Sigh.4. The decapitation towards the end.  Best fight sequence of the film.  But nasty.A definite winner, on all counts.**** out of four.",9,0,0,28 December 2001
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Like being united with old friends while making brand new ones!
","As soon as the opening titles hit and the familiar music began to play, I got teary eyed. This was like a reunion of sorts, with characters who you never wanted to part with while at the same time introducing new characters who you'd love to be friends with. From best friends, like Gandalf, to worst enemies, Gollum and Saruman, everyone was welcome.Seeing this film, I am convinced that only Peter Jackson could have pulled it off. Like Tim Burton, his films have a certain look and feel to them that I don't think another director could have captured. You know instantly you are in the LOTR universe and that is an encouraging thought.Kudos to Martin Freeman playing Bilbo to a T. Sir Ian is flawless as always, slipping back into the Gandalf role with ease. I was most happy to see Mr. Aiden Turner, late of BBC's 'Being Human' in his major motion picture debut. He was given quite a bit to do and I think he did quite well.The 3D is done well enough but you can skip it if you really need to.",10,1,7,17 December 2012
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Suck it up fanboys. Star Wars is moving on!
","It's arrogant to assume that the Star Wars films, like the force, belong exclusively to one group of people. These movies no longer belong to those who grew up with them, but to everyone, old and young. The films are moving on and if you can't deal with that, then perhaps it's time you got off the Star Wars train.",9,12,33,15 December 2017
The Dark Knight," Speechless.....
","I'm not going to reiterate what's being said about Chris Nolan's new Batman film, 'The Dark Knight'. Just this: Years ago, I made a post on the Internet Movie Database regarding the new film 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. I titled the post 'Great, but not the second coming of cinema.' Well....I have seen the second coming of cinema, and it is 'The Dark Knight'.Amazing, absolutely amazing. Bale is a wonderful Batman, but Nicholson (as great as he is) has nothing on Ledger, and Tommy Lee Jones (one of my favs of all time) can't even hold a candle to Eckhart's turn as Two-Face.",10,4,10,23 July 2008
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Typical Classic Python
","I don't know why everyone complains about the ending of this movie.  It is, after-all, typical Python humor.  Terry Gilliam said they loved to remove the punchline, and that's what they did.  This is a fantastic movie!",Null,0,0,19 July 1999
