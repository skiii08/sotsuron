Your Name.," A story what can change your viewing perception
","Some movies can touch anybody's heart and 'Your name'' is one of the best in heart touching movie. When I saw this my mind refreshes. It changed my perception of thinking a story. When Mitshua died it touches my mind. I felt an unknown emotion but end time my mind gets a joy.
Thanks everyone for making THIS type of movie.",10,0,1,24 November 2019
