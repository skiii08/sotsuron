Scarface," Al Pacino creates one of the more powerful, frightening characters in film.
","Scarface (1983) **** (Out of 5): In an outstanding, passionate performance, Al Pacino establishes his Tony Montana as a ruthless, angry man with a determination to get through anything to get to, and stay at, the top. The movie revolves around Tony, in a similar fashion to the way The Godfather, Part II is centered around Michael Corleone (also played by Pacino), and his performance manages to carry the load of a 170 minute movie very well. Everything, from his accent to his look to his established tough guy attitude, is credible and realistic to the man Tony is meant to be. You get the sense immediately that Tony respects trust and loyalty, and any step against that results in imminent death (again, much like Michael's handling of backstabbers). As a result, the viewer is in constant apprehension and even fear for the people who get between Tony and his ideals of success. In a role that makes or breaks the movie, Al Pacino definitely makes it.",Null,0,1,15 June 2004
Schindler's List," The most powerful movie you will ever see
","Schindler's List was by far the best movie of 1993, and it could vary well contend for title of 'greatest movie ever made.' This is because it was made to portray suffering of innocents at the hands of sadistic evil, and all that a lone good man can do to save them. Because this movie is so well made, directed, acted, etc., it nails its goal, and leaves the audience completely moved by the story it spent three hours witnessing.The acting in this movie is tremendous, and winds up being crucial towards capturing the story's emotion. 1993 Best Actor should-have-been Liam Neeson, and Ben Kingsley, who should have walked away with a Best Supporting Actor award, steal the scene as the heroic Schindler and his good friend, right-hand man, businessman and (sometimes) sense of good, Itzhak Stern. Their performances, combined with the evil Ralph Fiennes injects into his role as the monstrous Amon Goeth, make for a film that rises above any other historical drama and is placed into the upper echelon of movies and masterpieces. The emotion, pain and suffering is all real, and when you combine this with superb acting and flawless directing, you wind up with a film that demonstrates completely the passion of the Holocaust. Schindler's List moves the viewer in a way no other movie has approached, it takes anyone with a heart and makes him or her recognize their emotions and feelings on the matter. This film is important, and should at some time be viewed by everybody.",10,9,13,8 November 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Solid
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is an all-around fine, sound, decent and 'above-to-well-above-average' movie. It achieves such a description despite having acting that, in the opinion of this commentator, was not spectacular. Carrey and Winslet put together lead performances that work for their roles and don't disappoint at all, but don't rise beyond such a standard, or towards Award-nominating levels. The real strength of the movie is the long, complex and wonderfully enigmatic plot. This movie makes you think, makes you wonder, about the way the mind works and whether something, such as a relationship or person, can be so 'wrong' that it/he/she is truly worth forgetting altogether. Such a theme for a movie is tough to pull off, but director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman do so with supreme cinematic and special effect skill. Kirsten Dunst, in a lesser role than that of Carrey and Winslet, doesn't let down either, but comes across thin at times. Wrapup: decent acting, wonderfully intriguing story and expression. Rating: 8.5/10; IMDB rating: 8",7,0,2,25 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Highly flawed, but still effective
","Do not get the idea that 'Revenge of the Sith' is a perfect movie. There are both issues that Lucas failed to confront from Episodes I and II that, unfortunately, still exist, and there are definitely questions about areas that are introduced in this movie. Nevertheless, 'Revenge of the Sith' is still by far the best of Lucas' three prequels, and it does set the stage well for what is to come in what became the masterpieces of the saga.Among the problems with 'Sith' is the still toxic dialogue between Hayden Christenson and Natalie Portman. Lucas still believes a positive exists in Christenson's inability to act, and he exploits it for the second straight time in trying to get him to form an affective relationship with Portman, whose true acting talents are somewhat hidden when she speaks with him. The words and phrases remain corny and disposable, and are easily forgettable. Lucas does have the common sense, fortunately, to add weight to Christenson's lines, so he doesn't remain some over-actor who brings down everybody else while happening to look good using a light saber.While Lucas does do a fine job of explaining how every factor leads to its state in Episode IV, making the transition from modern prequel to 70's sequel easier, there are still questions that a typical viewer would bring into focus. Why does a Jedi win a fight using, for example, the ability to repel or attract large objects from long distances, and yet, seem to abandon and forget this ability while fighting a following opponent? How does Yoda make the transition from saber-bearing warrior (as he also was in Episode II) to, after only 19 or so years, a wise yet feeble, ready-to-die, ancient creature? These are only a few of the 'problems' I noticed, that Lucas seemed to either ignore or forget to address entirely.Despite its shortcomings, Lucas does what he can with an already-created past and future, and winds up with a respectable and surely enjoyable film. 'Sith' does well to recover the path of the original three that was lost in the creation of I and II, and it reaches the dark levels required of a plot of its substance. Lucas' creation, most likely his last containing Wookies and droids, is not perfect, but it gets its point across, and with emphasis to spare. May the Force be with you.",7,3,6,23 May 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," A Brilliant, Masterful film
","The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most thrilling, well-made movies of all time. Having been drawn up from Thomas Harris' bestselling novel, the movie is flawlessly written and possesses immaculate acting from all characters involved, which becomes, deservedly, the heart of the film. While all involved became their roles and acted superbly, it is really Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins who take the credit come judging time. The characters are so different: Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, AFI's number one villain, a freakishly brilliant and frighteningly destructive serial cannibal, whose psychotic mind hosts the facts and clues everyone needs to solve the case and track down the elusive Buffalo Bill. Foster is Clarice Starling, the protagonist, the incredibly strong, courageous and sharp heroine of the story, who overcomes her scarred past and measly FBI trainee label to surge past the real FBI and catch up to Bill herself. It is impossible to walk away from this film without numerous thoughts racing through your mind, especially about the sparkling acting, story, directing and all-around movie's production. Silence of the Lambs has become one of America's greatest films, a psychological thriller that makes you think every step of the way. Oscars for best actress Jodie Foster, actor Anthony Hopkins and director Jonathan Demme. Well deserved.",10,2,3,13 April 2004
Apollo 13," The Ultimate Physics Movie
","This is the movie that is basically the quintessential physics movie. From when the tanks explode to when it splashes down, the whole film is based upon fundamental physics and Newton's laws. The astronauts keep from firing the rockets in fear of igniting the fuel and blowing themselves up, so they let the module coast towards the moon to 1) let the force of gravity swing them back. The second physics point is that by letting the module coast, they know it will get to the moon as an object in motion stays in motion until acted upon by a force, in which case the settings of space don't allow there to be any. They then fear about burning up upon re-entry, which brings up the force of friction and air resistance that cause the heat to take place. If you are struggling in physics, specifically with Newton's laws, just watch Apollo 13 and all your problems will fade away.",8,0,2,1 October 2003
