Iron Man 3," Help!!! Somebody save this franchise!
","What were the makers of Iron Man 3 thinking? Do they take their audience for fools? Maybe we are.As we flocked to see a screening of this movie at a local Imax 3D theatre, I was filled with a lot of expectation. But as the movie progressed (?) with a wafer thin plot (most unbelievable!) I found myself squirming at the ludicrous and forced twists and turns. There are very obvious plot holes... how do the bad guys find out where Stark lands after he escapes when his Malibu residence is attacked? How does Pepper survive a 200 foot fall? I was appalled by what Ben Kingsley is made to do on screen. His rendition of Mandarin is laughable when you realise who he really is. Why would such a senior thespian stoop so low? Some critics had equated his role at par with the Joker. But trust me, he is nowhere close. All the film makers have achieved is to make a caricature of Kingsley. Ugh!!Robert Downey Jr. looks stoned most of the time and I wonder whether he really believed in the storyline. At the end credits there is a voice-over of RDJ which hints that 'He is very much the Iron man'....is this a hint for part 4? I shudder at the thought.Somebody really needs to rework this franchise.",3,24,47,29 April 2013
Interstellar," Brilliantly executed 'immersive' experience. A big thumbs up!!
","Christopher Nolan deserves a toast for Interstellar. How on earth (!) did he manage to pull it off? After the compelling Gravity (2013), Interstellar is perhaps the most gripping space adventure to hit the silver screen. This inter-galactic space saga is bound to achieve a lot more than merely creating new milestones at the box office. The movie begins without much of a foundation but within minutes we get to know that the story is set in the near future with humanity on the verge of getting wiped out. No melodrama here. All the characters seem to be resigned to the fate of turning farmers, abandoning their pre-apocalypse professions. Matthew McConnaghey plays Cooper, an ex-pilot, now growing corn. It is also suggested that mankind does not need engineers anymore but more farmers to feed the remaining humankind. Cooper grapples with his daughter's teacher at the parent-teacher meeting, where the shocked teacher reveals that Murphy had discussed with her classmates about the authenticity of the moon landing. Efforts are being made to wean away people from science. Earth has been turned into a giant dust bowl and the only means of survival seems to produce as much food as you can. The family is in fact shown eating all preparations made of corn while having lunch.Michael Caine yet again features in a Nolan movie and plays the senior Dr. Brand. He somehow convinces Cooper to join a near impossible mission of going through a wormhole adjacent to Saturn to look for habitable planets in some other galaxy. Some trial expeditions have already been deployed. Data is scant but promising. There is a lot of techno-babble in the movie but it is simplified as much as possible. While in space Cooper grapples with getting separated from his family, the prospect of not seeing them ever again, treachery, aging I cannot reveal more here.I have read in some reviews that the science depicted in this movie is spot on. I am not surprised. Michael Crichton, the master of sci-fi, always said that good science fiction always had its roots in good science. At the end, this is a father-daughter saga with a very strong premise, assured handling, brilliant performances, fantastic music and out-of-the-world VFX. I understand Nolan is against using the green screen and he also shunned the idea to shoot in 3d. Brilliant. Such conviction!I was surprised and happy to see the Indian Air Force Drone in American skies! New Delhi is mentioned once. Just go for it.",9,3,9,7 November 2014
Prometheus," Does not live up to high expectations
","I went to watch Prometheus with a lot of expectation. The prospect of watching Ridley Scott's latest that too in Imax and 3d was riveting in itself. The movie was disappointing in many respects. I wanted to watch Prometheus in spite of all the negative feedback it got hammered with because of Scott's reputation as a storyteller. What I got in the bargain was a movie which begins with an interesting premise but goes nowhere. The motives of some of the characters were not fleshed out. Why did David, the android put the black gooey stuff in the drink which he made for Dr. Holloway? If David is indeed an android and beyond human emotions why did he feel the urge to warn Dr. Elizabeth of impending danger at the climax and why does he convince her to rescue him? What is Charlize Theron's agenda? The captain of the ship is shown heroic but also has a high libido and has no qualms in proposing to lay his boss's daughter. There is an engineer, a geologist but again their purpose of being included on the mission remains clouded. They appear goofy at best with no semblance of intelligence. The geologist says, 'I love rocks'. The movie pretends to be serious but turns out to be nothing but a good vs. evil drama. All this talk of 'where we come from', 'who created us', 'what is our purpose' remain unanswered, as they should be. Scott seems to have slipped big time in trying to make a magnum opus. Admittedly the movie has stunning visuals and has some compelling on screen events like the machine operating on Dr. Elizabeth or the holographic galaxy forming in the cave But the movie lacks content. Scott keeps the back door open with the promise of a sequel. I shudder at the thought. I barely managed to stay awake in this 2 hour 'saga'.",3,4,8,10 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Stunning end to a stunning trilogy
","I went to watch the IMAX version of The Dark Knight Rises with a lot of expectation. And boy, was I impressed!!! This was a very difficult movie to pull off as comparisons with the earlier two installments were imminent. Does Bane have the same menace as the Joker? Yes, and more. Perhaps he does not appear as manic as the Joker, but Tom Hardy sure makes a scary villain. Christian Bale as the Batman is in top form as he appears vulnerable, determined and defeated as the script demands. He seems to breathe life into the character of Bruce Wayne. Able support is lent by veterans Michael Caine, Gary Oldman (such an angst ridden face!) and who can forget Morgan Freeman who is grace personified!Anne Hathaways' portrayal of the Cat Woman makes the movie a bit more entertaining though her character could have been more fleshed out.One can notice several Nolan favourites in this movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt, Marion Cotillard, ... they all do reasonably well.The action sequences are jaw dropping. The opening sequence where Bane escapes from a plane or the scene where bridges are blown and an entire football stadium goes down are just stunning. I guess it is time that the reigns of Bond AND the Jason Bourne franchise are handed over to Nolan! Such is his mastery over the medium.A word about the musical score. This is perhaps Hans Zimmer' best.I found just a couple of trivial inconsistencies but I guess these can be easily overlooked.The climax was totally unexpected and one is amazed with the alacrity with which Nolan has put all the pieces together. Will Batman return? I guess not. This movie is all about hope, friendship, love, dedication, retribution, self-belief, loyalty... All the values which one cherishes. One comes out of the theatre with a smile which remains pasted for a long time :) This is essentially a good versus evil drama told with such great panache and style!!Nolan apparently has kept the door open for a Robin franchise now... Only time will tell.",10,2,6,28 July 2012
