Hereditary," About a half of an hour too long
","The first half of this movie is a very good, edge-of-your-seat thriller that has a lot of potential. Then the movie just turns into a predictable, gore fest, with the tired old initiation into Satan's hell thing going on. Yawn! I was ready for it to end about a half of an hour before it did. I like a longer film if it is good. This one promises, but just doesn't deliver. The ending is predictable, and weak.",6,3,6,12 June 2018
A Star Is Born," A Review From A Guy
","This was a pretty good movie. It was a real tearjerker toward the end. If I was capable of emotion, I might have cried. But seriously, this should have been the Lady Gaga story, and they should of gotten rid of that annoying dude (AKA Bradley Cooper). He was just not likable. He was kind of ugly, dirty, hairy, and a real nuisance. When he pissed himself, that was it for me. Just kill him off already! Sorry About the spoiler.",8,3,6,31 October 2018
The Favourite," A typical guy's point of view
","Basically, this is a film about a lesbian love triangle, with two mistresses vying for the affection of an ailing, middle-aged queen. As her lover, and confidant they both try to manipulate the queen for their own personal gain. I doubt the film has much historical accuracy. It is purely fiction. However, it is a very well-made movie, in all aspects, and the acting is good. This film is sure to receive an Oscar nomination for best picture. It has all the ingredients that the Academy likes in a movie. But, what this movie lacks is a solid ending. The viewer is in suspense, waiting for the big ending, when it just cuts off to the credits, leaves you hanging. You are supposed to draw you own conclusions, but that just doesn't cut it.",8,2,6,28 December 2018
A Quiet Place," A Pretty Good Suspence Film
","This movie will keep the viewer in suspense, nearly the entire film. It is good, but it has a few major holes in the story that were just plain illogical. For one, why would this family choose to have a baby when their lives depend on their silence? I mean, a screaming new born baby is not what you want to carry around with you in that situation. Their youngest son is taken by one of the creatures, early in the film. Why would this family leave their little four year old son to trail behind them, unsupervised, as they walked through a very dangerous wooded area, where the slightest sound could give them away? It made no sense. This child's death was obviously a disaster waiting to happen. But, the biggest hole in the story was how easily these carnivorous, fresh-eating creatures could be killed. A shot gun blast is all it took to kill one. If there doesn't happen to be a shotgun handy, these creatures can also be subdued with a high pitched sound. If these creatures could be done away with so easily, how did they manage to kill, and eat most of the population of earth? Again, it just doesn't add up. So, to sum things up, it was a very entertaining suspense film, with some serious holes in the story. I also found the ending to be kind of weak.",7,2,3,19 April 2018
A Quiet Place," Pretty Good Suspence/Horror Movie
","A Quiet Place is a pretty good movie. It keeps the viewer in suspense for the entire film. I thought that the ending was kind of weak, And, this is one of the reasons why I only gave this film a seven out of ten. There were, also, a few major holes in the story that were just plain illogical. For one, why would this family leave their vulnerable, little four year old son to trail behind them, unsupervised, as they walked through a very dangerous wooded area. It made no sense. It was obviously a disaster waiting to happen. But, the biggest hole in the story was how easily these carnivorous, fresh-eating monsters could be killed. A shot gun blast is all it took to kill one. If there doesn't happen to be a shotgun handy, they can also be subdued with a high pitched sound. If these creatures could be done away with so easily, how did they manage to kill, and eat most of the population of earth? Again, it just doesn't add up. So, to sum things up, it was a very entertaining suspense film, with some serious holes in the story.",7,1,2,19 April 2018
The Shape of Water," Overrated
","The Shape of Water is not a bad film, but I don't believe that it deserved the Academy Award for best picture. I didn't see any of the other films that were nominated, so maybe this was the best of the lot. Huh? I think that this is another one of those Oscar winners that will be forgotten. An Oscar winning film should have a riveting story line, along with intelligent subject matter. This film just doesn't have it. It was somewhat predictable. They did not need all the blood, and gore. The creature from the deep was just not a likeable thing. It is like the old Creature From The Black Lagoon on steroids. The film left a lot out and wasn't very believable. The dialog, and the personalities of the characters did not fit the time frame of this movie. It wasn't very true to life. Hence, it was not all that interesting.
The reviews on this site that give this film high praise must have been made by paid reviewers.",5,12,34,26 March 2018
Green Book," Uplifting, but an insult to Italian Americans
","This movie was uplifting. It was based on the association/friendship between two men, but it is, for the most part, fiction. It is only loosely based on truth. To please Hollywood, they put in the part about Don Shirley being caught having sex with another man at a YMCA. According to what I have read, this never happened. It surprises me that Hollywood is so concerned about furthering the cause of the LGBT community, and about paying homage to the plight of African Americans in this country, yet they give the Academy Award to a film that portrays an Italian American man in the worst light. This film plays off a stereotype that insults the intelligence. This movie portrays Frank Anthony Vallelonga as a total idiot. That he wasn't. He was a very intelligent actor. If he were alive today, I am sure that he would object to his name being placed on this character in the film. I am sure that Don Shirley would object to the way his character is portrayed, as well.",7,1,2,28 February 2019
Annihilation," Unbelievable
","The visual effects are captivating, but that is about it. This movie has more holes than Swiss cheese. There are so many questions. There is this 'shimmer' that covers a large portion of land in the United States. It has swallowed up a small town, along with an army base. And, it has been in place for three years. If a phenomenon like this actually occurred, it would be the focus of world attention. It would be major. It would be viewed as a possible threat to the planet, and humankind. The United States, which has sent probes to distant planets, and the rest of the world would have employed the most advanced technology on this thing. Scientists around the world would be analyzing the information. Instead, this phenomenon is not even in the news, and, aside from the US government, no none seems to know anything about it? The government has never bothered to fly a drone into the shimmer, or drop a probe? Instead, they just send these small groups of explorers into the shimmer to never return. It's ridiculous. Maybe the book would explain it more, but the book should not be a prerequisite for the film.",3,1,2,26 March 2018
