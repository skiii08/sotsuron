The Perks of Being a Wallflower," OK movie, a bit disgusting though.
","SPOILER ALERT: I've been referring to IMDb's ratings for a few years before I check or a movie. One thing I didn't expect is the disgusting phaggotry this movie teems with.If I wanted to see males in drag I'd go watch a Travolta flick. Hence the low rating. I'm sick of Hollywood stuffing their homosexual agenda down or throats people need to stand up for what is right which is definitely not seeing and applauding teenage boys in garter and other prostitute wear.All else aside, its a decent movie but I wouldn't recommend unless you're a brokeback fan. If I paid for this I'd be utterly disappointed.",4,1,6,31 October 2013
