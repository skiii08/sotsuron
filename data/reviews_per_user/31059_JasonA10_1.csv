The Blair Witch Project," Different Experience, but indeed good.
","I just finished reading over many of the other comments on this film and it was interesting to me the overwhelming negative response I noticed.  I personally didn't think that this movie wasn't exceptionally scary, however, I thought it was excellently done.  Interestingly enough, many people have taken shots at the acting in this movie.  The irony is that your criticisms are a testimony to the abilities of the movie makers to capture a 'non-acted' performance from the actors.  The fits and 'insanity' between the actors during many scenes do justice to the attempt here to create a 'documentary' feel.  This movie was never intended to look or feel like a high budget Hollywood film, and it doesn't.  What is does feel like is an authentic experience of the three.  The scare factor lies in your own mind. You can easily sit through this movie and not be scared of anything, or you can leave terrified if you allow yourself to submerge into the intensity of the film.  The precept behind the film is fascinating.And although many people also criticize the hype surrounding the movie, I think that it is that mythology that creates the movie.  It is the entire package that makes the experience worth while. I would recommend it as a great experience.  No, it is not an incredible work of cinematography, but it is a remarkable film.",Null,1,2,24 August 1999
