War Dogs," A movie for 5th graders to teach them that good always prevails !!!
","What could have been a great anti-hero setup on the war industry like 'Lord of War, turns to be a moral tale of good winning over badThe story starts off well developing both the characters and setting up Efraim as an anti-hero. The Jordan episode cements you to the protagonists and you can only expect the story to get more interesting. Instead it loses plot and everything comes crashes down for our heroes.The whimper ending, under-utilization of Brad Cooper and too much being fitted into one movie leaves a movie which has no memorable scenes.Watch it just for the guns and 'Dick Cheney's America' !!!",6,0,1,22 April 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Watch it only for the fantastic Beasts !!!
","A Spin off from the Harry potter franchise, you wonder how they can make a movie out of a textbook.The plot line is pretty standard with love, betrayal and climax. A huge focus on the protagonist leads to underdevelopment of the main villain. The movie ends in a whimper when compared to the initial build up.You won't even feel frightened from the main villain who goes off as quickly as he comes. On the positive side, a huge production budget lends to gorgeous animations. You are able to see many of Rowling's creations come to life. Its a fun to watch how they are unique in their own respect with magic complimenting their personalities.Watch the movie just for these Fantastic Beasts and hope that the sequels are able to do justice to the series.",7,0,0,18 April 2017
