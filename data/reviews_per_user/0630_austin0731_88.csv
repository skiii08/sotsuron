Ford v Ferrari," Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles
","A film that centers around the two central characters and their two central performances: Matt Damon's Caroll Shelby and Christian Bale's Ken Miles. As such, these were the two performances that the entire film would rest on, fortunately, Matt Damon and Christian Bale both give wonderful performances in this biopic. Ford v ferrari had these brilliant performances as well as an interesting story that is at its core about two men who are fighting for their passion being warped into the 'dick measuring contest' between two large corporate car manufacturers.
As such, the film is brilliantly titled as to reflect the fact that at the end, the story that is recorded will always be the competition between Ford and Ferrari, overlooking the true heroes of the story, Ken Miles and Caroll Shelby. Ford v Ferrari does a great job introducing audiences who may not be familiar with the subject into the world of cars, not over explaining but, simplifying and focusing on what is important making is a very easy viewing. Overall, Ford v ferrari had two memorable performances and was an emotional and insightful ride into the story of these two men.",8,2,4,23 December 2019
Blade Runner 2049," A visual masterpiece with a story line that is all too familiar
","Firstly, Blade Runner 2049 is stunning to behold. The cinematography is insanely mesmerizing and leads to such intrigue that makes you just want to keep watching on. Blade Runner 2049 was a very interesting meditation of AI and technology and humanity, it does so very well. But I can't help but imagine how much better it would've been if these same ideas weren't explored in other recent works like 'Her' and 'Westworld'. To Blade runner's credit it was the original film that heavily influenced and inspired these works but I was just looking for something more and different to this highly overused genre. Nonetheless Blade Runner 2049 does it impeccably and probably is the best look and exploration into these ideas. Ryan Gosling does amazing work in this film and his role really allowed him to perform and to express these intense emotional scenes which is one major enjoyment of this film. Ana de Armas character I felt was very interesting I towards the end leaves audiences with an ironic twist that I enjoyed a lot. This was a very long film, almost 3 hours long and even though it feels like this lengthy epic I can't help but be slightly disappointed with the lack of action sequences. There surely was plenty of great ones but I felt that it needed a bit more of this sort of action flare to be a much more exciting watch. Now, I do understand the the story delivered was a subtle but mesmerising one but I still believe that a few climaxing fight scenes could really elevate this film especially because there is so much exposition and build up that essentially just ends up being rather flat. But, it cannot be denied that this is a great film and like the first is sure to spark controversy and discussion. So to summarise, Blade Runner 2049 was great, there were good performances and impeccable cinematography. However in terms of storytelling it somewhat seems like we've seen very similar stories before and even though there is an unexpected twist that adds some sort of a new flare to the genre ultimately I feel that I've seen similar things. I have to say I did go in with sky high expectations so unfortunately there were slight disappointments personally.",8,3,10,6 October 2017
Your Name.," best anime movie ever
","Your name was truly a surprise to me, I would say that it is the best anime movie that I have watched. Though many have been of great enjoyment I have never felt such emotional depth in any of the other anime movies out there. Your name starts off at quite a slow pace featuring the main characters swapping bodies which is quite enjoyable with some comedic elements, but what is truly astonishing is probably in the second and third act of this film. The art and music of this film is amazing too.What I felt was a very amazing feat that the film managed to achieve is to take such clichéd ideas (romance, time travel) and to play it out on such a way that makes it just feel so different and original. The film had a very steady rhythm as we gradually build up to the reveal of the identities of our main characters. Another thing that was done well, the pacing.This film managed to give its audience a sense of emptiness, watching the film and following the main characters as they struggle to remember the names of each other can really be hard to watch at times as they have done such a great job making us emotionally invested in these characters. From them having to write their names on each others hands, to after the time gap when the characters themselves are feeling this sense of dread and searching for something just creates such a hollow and glum atmosphere. After watching this movie I felt that the ending could be a point of controversy, perhaps a minor flaw. About the finale, those who rooted for the 'happy ending' got a somewhat happy ending with the couple meeting each other, but for those who rooted for an film to continue the artistic approach of having this idea of emptiness also got their ending since we never know what happens after the couple have met. I personally liked this ending, at one point of the movie when the two basically walk pass each other I thought that would be the end, however it wasn't and after seeing the actual ending I think that though that could've been an impactful end I do like the 'not so extreme' approach that the film chose to go by. Another flaw could be it's rewatchability, after seeing all the mysteries play out I don't think that this first time experience can be recreated, though I doubt that I wouldn't enjoy a second watch it would never be the same. A small issue I have but some may even argue that this is why it is so great.So overall, high praise to this film, one of the greatest drawings in an anime film. It was visually stunning to behold, the music was great completed with great lyrics and managed to make those key scenes so much more. The plot was original and very interesting. Finally the emotions, this sense of emptiness that the film builds up and makes its audience fee was really an experience like none other.",10,6,13,21 October 2016
10 Cloverfield Lane," This was a very scary film on the human level
","The follow up to Cloverfield, but personally this is a far superior film to the original Cloverfield movie. It was intense and unsettling, but be warned that this is not exactly the cloverfield sequel that you may expect this is very well a stand alone film. We begin with following this girl who just broke up with her boyfriend and ends up in a car accident, when she wakes up she finds herself in a bunker with a man who claims that he has saved her and that the air outside is toxic and that they are stuck there but the real question is, is there really some thing out there or is he just insane? Cloverfield lane brings the large scale of the original film to a small human level, which is actually very scary. In some senses this sort of situation is a lot scarier than a big rampaging monster, those moments when you just can't quite get a grip of who's who and what's what. A brilliant thriller and look at the monsters within humans.The three characters who we basically spend the entire movie with are all great however the best performance is definitely from John Goodman. The movie tagline: 'monsters come in many form' is very fitting in terms of describing John Goodman's character. His character was one who cared a lot about keeping things the way he wants it and would not take any crap. He constantly poses as a threat that seemed very real which really makes viewers understand the threat, because this guy looks like he could crush your skull with his bare hands. What makes it really scary is how the film toys with you and how you can't really get a grip on what this guy is thinking.The ending however, I don't quite like the ending of the film. I don't feel like it was necessary and I feel that it kind of just brought the intense action to this over the top monster movie thing which was quite rushed. So that wasn't really a good choice, although I do understand that it is done to have some kind of relation to cloverfield wouldn't it be better if instead of what we got, we get like a scene with the cloverfield monster walking towards the bunker in the background. It's just an idea.",8,1,4,24 May 2016
It," A brilliant new direction for the horror genre
","As someone who is not a massive horror fan this is the type of horror film that I would enjoy and that I wish studios would do more often. It elevates the horror game completely, it shows us that a horror film can be done well and done right and still have a central storyline that is engaging and full of interesting/relatable characters. It really tries to separate itself from the crowd, avoiding common horror tropes like jump scares. This is something that I really liked, it is a very inventive film that does just replace the central 'monster'/threat with a new one making no attempts at character building and actually telling a coherent story. The balance of horror and story telling was grasped very well as we don't feel too expositional or a sense of pointlessness.It has a wonderful cast of characters, all the child actors did great at portraying children in such a situation. They had great chemistry with each other and gave performances that showed such courage and love that is truly beyond their age. Alexander Skarsgard who played Pennywise also captured this character very well, from the way that his eyes pointed at different directions(one directly at the audience), his speech pattern and movement were all done impeccably. It also tackles a few central themes very well, the themes of fear, bullying, small town ugliness and a coming of age story. The fear element was done very well, the way that It can morph into the physical appearance of one's fear gave lots of space to explore fear and specifically what children fear. For example whenever Bill felt afraid we see rain or water, relating to his greatest fear of losing his brother. Or in Beverly, where the theme of blood can be seen, relating to her fear of maturity and sexual impulses. These subtle details were dropped in very well and ties in perfectly with the sense of fear that the story tries to explore.Also, there is a very interesting way in which It depicts the adults in this small town, the movie shows us the most grotesque angles of humanity. This may be another way of depicting how children view adults as monsters and fear adults, but it may also be tieing in with the idea that the small town feel is just a mask for grotesque humanity. The way that the adults carry out disgustingly immoral acts and simply turn a blind eye to all that is happening in the town are just a few examples of this. Overall, It was a great film that reminded me a lot of several mature movies/TV shows about children. Stuff like Goonies and Stranger Things just to name a couple. If this film must be criticised I think it is with the lack of development in Pennywise's character, even though this could be to preserve a sense of mystery and may be resolved in the second film. Also the middle area of the film verges on being slightly repetitive with the scenes of each child being attacked by Pennywise, but these really are just minor, personal complaints",7,5,10,12 September 2017
Detroit," A riveting drama that manages to capture the realistic experience of life during 1967 Detroit
","The riveting drama taking place in 1967 Detroit in the Algiers motel, this film stars various actors including John Boyega, Anthony Mackie, Will Poulter and even to my surprise, John Krasinski. This film takes place in the midst of racial tension and tension between the people and Detroit P.D. Depicting various scenes of violence, robbery and the city turning into a complete war zone, amongst the mess then focuses on the Algiers motel where all of the characters come together to set up the main story.The whole cast does a wonderful job depicting their individual characters, there is a backstory that can be seen through the dialogue, demeanor and expression of each character. The feeling that these people are real, genuine people and not characters in a movie. This strong sense of realism translates to this conflict amongst the characters which establishes the main drama of the film very well. The way that the film manages to have such great characters with individual story arcs makes them all the more sympathetic and their motives all the more clear and logical. Even in the case of Will Poulter's 'bad cop' you can understand where he is coming from and he shows certain levels of mercy and there is a very clear thought process that can be seen as an audience through the character's actions and dialogue. Detroit, manages to seem so real, almost to the extent of a documentary and that is precisely what makes the film so successful. Because it exuberates this sense of realism there are stakes that audiences can actually feel genuine emotions, dangers and intensity about. Detroit manages to retell a faithful tale of mistakes, fear, ignorance and pain in its 2 hours and 23 minutes runtime without ever feeling too long or dragged along.",8,0,1,15 April 2018
Rocketman," The latest music bio-pic is....
","There has been a slew of bio pics based on musical legends in recent years, most notably Bohemian Rhapsody and now, Rocketman. However, in comparison to an older musical biopic like Walk the line about Johnny Cash's life it certain adds flare but loses narrative. Bohemian Rhapsody was drawn out and poorly structured, in this case Rocketman was messy and jumbled, jumping from scene to scene.Ofcourse, ignoring the lack of narrative structure, the individual set pieces and scenes were wonderfully done, and the performance by Taron Edgerton was great. Stringed together is a montage of really great and over the top music videos but barely justified as a complete piece of cinema, narrative and all.",7,0,1,2 July 2019
A Star Is Born," Fairly enjoyable but quite the formulaic romance
","A Star is born came out with much fanfare and was praised for being this amazing romance film that featured great performance by both Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. Personally, I enjoyed the film but found it slightly formulaic and I felt that it dragged towards the end of the movie, The music and songs were of course flawless and very impactful in the telling of the story. But all in all quite a standard story, that is definitely well executed but lacking in deeper substance.I do struggle with determining whether that great execution and the coherent storytelling can in fact allow me to look past its lack of a deeper meaning and originality; but, unfortunately I don't really think so in this case. But that is simply up to personal preferences. This movie is definitely a delight and should be considered 'fairly good', one of those that would give you a good cry but beyond that not much to marinate on or thika about.",7,0,0,8 June 2019
Wind River," A very compelling thriller that discusses the theme of survival and oppression
","Wind river was a very compelling murder mystery that had a slow burn build up to a very brutal reveal. Over the years Jeremey Renner has proved to be a very capable action hero but in Wind River he shows a more dramatic side to him and I think it was great. Elizabeth Olsen has steadily been climbing to be one of my favourite actresses too and I very much look forward to her future works. Wind River tells the story of the missing demographic, Native American women. It told audiences of the horrors an unjust that has gone to them and the way that the government seems to swipe away this important statistic. This is a very important message that Wind River presents but it does so in a fabulous way.This is a brilliant story of the cold harsh snow and the struggle for survival. Jeremy Renner as Cory Lambert puts it best in this film, he talks about how luck doesn't live out here and it takes heart, strength and the will to survive to survive out in these harsh environments. The film paints a picture of isolation and having to help from various means that was done so very well to present this idea.At the same time while we don't necessarily sympathize with the perpetrators it is presented in a way that is very reasonable. The harsh and bitter environment turns people insane sometimes and drives them to do things that they wouldn't do. In fact Wind River does this other subtle thing where lots of the characters, you can tell have a sense of angst and a sense of pushing down something. This sense of internal conflict where they constrain and oppress their emotions can really be seen. I believe there is a message here, perhaps that 'we should get over these sad moments in life not by pushing the emotions out but by letting them out'. Something that Lambert does in fact talk about in this film. It seems that it is this sense of oppression looming over everyone that drives the murderer to do the things that he has done in this film. I really enjoyed Wind River but if there is one issue I had it is with the reveal of the murder, the way in which they did it just seems rather odd to me and I don't like the way that the truth is understood by audiences but not by the characters in this film. There is no sense of unravelling the mystery through subtle clues but a literal projection on the screen. In my opinion it would've been a lot better to tell the story from Olsen, Jane Banner's eyes. To me this really takes away from the brilliant build Wind River had up till this point.",8,1,4,30 September 2017
Darkest Hour," A brilliant performance in a riveting bio pic about Churchill's time as prime minister
","Darkest hour was a very intriguing look at the politics during WWII, and serves as a pretty good companion piece to the earlier, Dunkirk. In fact Darkest hour and Dunkirk truly elevate each other as one plays out the story on the battleground the other discusses the issues on the homeland, the politics and behind the movement and the everyday people in Britain. Darkest hour featured Gary Oldman in one of his most riveting and believable roles as Winston Churchill, his delivery, without a doubt was one of the greatest depictions of a historical figure. But, a great performance by Gary Oldman was of course expected, the real enjoyment was how engaging the story itself actually is, Churchill's struggles as a politician and in gaining the support of the people and his own parliament was a brilliantly engaging story. Which is only elevated by Oldman's performance, the countless monologues that he gives were all so powerful and really packs a punch to me as an audience. While I am no expert in History, Darkest hour gives a very damaged and multifaceted character in Churchill. He is serious but there can be hints of jokes and sarcasm, he is scared but also courageous and firm. All of this is fine tuned by Oldman and his very subtle grunts, coughs and shaking fists. Darkest hour was truly a beautiful film, and never a dull moment both worthy of awards and audience likability. It was an in depth look into humanity, emotions and the flaws that make us human, and the flaws that make good leaders.",8,0,3,6 January 2018
Captain Marvel," Just ok supplement to the MCU
","Captain Marvel introduces the character of Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel and is Marvel's first attempt at a female solo superhero film. It is also because of this that the movie faced certain controversial topics and were tied with feminism and feminist debates. The movie was placed between Infinity War and Endgame to introduce us to one of Marvel's most powerful superheroes.Personally, I enjoyed the movie for what it was, it was a solid MCU entry but nothing amazing, which for MCU's standards is kind of disappointing. It was good, but lacks a lot of story and character development for one of the MCU's future stars. For me, the movie reminds me a lot of the MCU's phase 1 movies where the origin films weren't clear on who these characters are so they have very little layers and substance to them. In many ways Captain Marvel was very two dimensional and bland, exhibiting little that the audiences can relate to.I did somewhat enjoy Nick Fury's story arc and his relationship with Carol in this movie that has already played an important role in the greater MCU to come. Nick Fury is shown to be more comedic and with more character than in his previous iterations, this is something that I liked.In many ways this movie sets up a lot for the greater MCU as well as the future for the character and characters in this movie which I will be looking forward to but Captain Marvel seems more like a supplement than a fully self realized entry.But like I side, just fine is probably not good enough for the MCU at this point since they have shown time and time again that they have now mastered even origin stories with the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther being major successes.",7,0,4,19 April 2019
Passengers," A solid film that was sadly trampled by early critic reviews
","I believe that this was a good film, the performances were solid and the visuals were quite good too. The best performance probably from Michael Sheen as the android, Arthur. Despite all the comments on how this film does not utilize the idea of isolation and confinement well and that the romance in this film overtakes the more important theme of this film I enjoyed it, here's why. I thought that Passengers discusses a very important and age long question, the question of sacrificing your own well being or to sacrifice another's in order to fulfill your own. It's a very deep and thought provoking question that I believe the film possess very well. I thought that the themes of isolation and the romance between the characters were not overpowering each other and were well balanced by splitting it by acts. The film was suspenseful as our characters unravel the causes to the mysterious malfunctioning of the film and the empty atmosphere created by the film was really well realised as well. I felt that the characters were sympathetic and they made very rational and reasonable decisions unlike what early reviews have described as, 'creepy'. Of Course it lacked in some parts in terms of its rationality but this is always a thing that bugs some and doesn't at all bother others. I can be either of those people at times and I did find that certain points in this film were irrational in my opinion however are points that can be gotten over with. So I recognise that there are flaws in this film but it is a solid entry and an enjoyable watch that has been trampled over by the critics.",6,4,7,2 February 2017
Zootopia," Widen your perspective
","In this great melting pot of creatures and races, in this world without a single human Zootopia is probably the most important story of the year. Although it is set in this fantasy world it is surprisingly down to Earth and real. Whether it's the messages on racism, being prejudice or having dreams it is really quite thought provoking and philosophical.Before discussing the more philosophical ideas I would also like to acknowledge the brilliance in animation. Now, obviously this is Disney we're talking about so it's obviously to the high Disney standard. But the cast is really pretty amazing, Jason Bateman's Nick Wilde just had such a sly sense to his voice which fits perfectly with his character. Then Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps just was so charismatic and positive. I've always personally enjoyed Ginnifer Goodwin's performance on abc's Once upon a time so to see her land roles such as this was great, as seeing your favourite TV show actors and actresses transition into the big screen is always exciting. There is a point about having dreams in the beginning of the film when Judy's parents are really against the whole idea of her being a cop and tell her about not believing too much about her dreams. Well that was very real world and mature was what I thought, for a kids movie nonetheless. Not to say that I agree with papa Hopps at all, dreams are cool, they drive us.So to this whole idea of racism and the whole prey and predator thing, in modern day society there are always prejudice ideas and labelling. Growing up and being a teenager in Asia you could really feel that whether it's 'us' towards 'them or vice versa. Personally there is always a thing towards 'Black people' within older generations and a real negative vibe towards ghettos. Being brought up with this idea on the one hand and the very open minded international school on the other hand really made me see the shallow mindedness of certain people. But that's no one's fault, I mean it's no one's fault because fear all brews from ignorance and misunderstanding. People have such limited understanding of the 'outside world' beyond what they grew up on people get a really limited idea of how others are like. They get a very narrow perspective, and I guess that's the thing we always have to widen our view so we can get the full picture and not base our ideas on short sighted and limited views. This movie discusses ideas of labelling, how much that could mean to someone and how hurtful it could be indeed. As previously mentioned, it is important to understand each other, but take it to the next level of embracing those differences. We live in a world of diversity much like 'Zootopia' there are people of all difference shape and sizes people of different races and colours, we all have our defining features but we should never forget that we also have our similarities. Take those similarities as a bridge, or an extending hand but then through those similarities learn about the differences. We live in such a colourful world, but if we choose to live amongst the same black and white there is a whole other dimension that we would never be able to see. For our own sake and for the sake of others, 'Try everything'",8,4,11,31 March 2016
Us," Great pure horror and equally brilliant social commentary
","Us is director Jordan Peele's second entry in the Horror genre and it is exciting to see his work after the success of Get Out. Peele once again exhibits his knack for telling scary stories with the flair of social commentary and racial commentary.This movie on a standalone horror perspective is much better made in comparison to Get out, there was more scares and was overall more intense and harkens back to classic Horror. It also manages to include comedic elements that were not cringe worthy and were very fitting.While being a better horror film compared to get out, it also nails its social commentary, the use of symbolism and metaphors is just amazing to see, making viewers want to pause at every frame to discover the subtle details. Us was a great experience that not only succeeds in Horror but also in Peele's no trademark social commentary, making viewers really think about cinema again.",8,0,3,19 April 2019
Aquaman," Visually stunning step in the right direction for DC
","Aquaman sets itself aside from the rest of the DC films by being what in my opinion is the best the franchise had to offer so far. Comparisons are bound to be made with the franchise's other arguable hit, Wonder Woman. Personally I think Aquaman beats Wonder Woman in that it had a final act that had a battle that was so visually appealing and interesting to look at that it absolutely blows Wonder Woman's failure of a third act out of the water.Which really is the story of Aquaman's success, it is a film that is wonderful to look at, the visual aspect of this film is that of a completely new level, with underwater shots and CGI that is groundbreaking and something that audiences have never seen before. The film had an interesting villain in Ocean mater, his motivations were well justified as the best villains should.Both Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were brilliant as Arthur and Mera as director James Wan excellently blends the actor's own traits into the characters. Utilizing Momoa's culture in the form of war cries and tribal tattoos to establish this new and modernized version of Aquaman.Aquaman is bound to wow audiences, while it's not the most interesting story wise it definitely sets itself apart as a fun and thrilling explosion of colours and visuals.",6,4,9,28 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Building on the success of its predecessor, great sequel
","Far exceeding the first installment of the potential franchise, Deadpool 2 brings more of what worked and less of what didn't. Many of the jokes land far better than the original, it was a a film that pushes boundaries in a way that might be considered forceful and deliberate but ultimately well suited for the loud mouth aesthetic of the merc with a mouth. The film takes itself a little more seriously than the first, this may be considered as a positive or negative pending on your opinion of the style that Deadpool brings. The filmmakers and Ryan Reynolds understand the character well, it is a good transition from comic book to film, with interesting cameos and a plethora of references to pop culture. Side characters get more of a shine in Deadpool two and proves to be one of the strong suits of Deadpool as a future franchise. The film builds firm foundations for future installments beyond the necessary 'origin story' that the first film was almost obliged to convey as a priority. Deadpool 2 is a welcomed addition and builds on what the first film was, better jokes, references and stronger character development of both Deadpool and the many side characters.",8,2,3,9 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," A very fun movie that sheds new light on the future direction of the MCU
","I think that this newest installment in the MCU, Thor:Ragnarok truly solidifies the MCU's new direction that has been commencing in phase 3. Contrary to the previous Marvel Phases this new Phase focuses on a new direction, in Phase 1 we had the origin stories which came together in the first Avengers movie. In Phase 2 we got some further world building in the different solo movies like Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But, other than these entries Marvel's Phase 2 also gave us some experimental projects like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant Man. Now in Phase 3 this experimental Marvel is coming in full force. In order for a franchise like Marvel to survive I think this new direction is very important if not necessary, it is very interesting that Marvel is now employing directors that are not necessarily the usual big budget movie directors but rather, directors of low budget movies such as Taika Waititi. Marvel Phase 3 seems to be all about having this ensemble of films with drastically different tones. We've had 2 comedies Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians 2. But we've also went into mystical/fantasy genres in Doctor Strange or serious dramas like Civil War. Not to mention the coming Black Panther that has a very estranged setting. All this is what the New Marvel has become and I think it is perfect. So, after discussing so much on the direction of the MCu I would like to pull the focus back to Thor: ragnarok, I can understand that many people did not like this film for its lack of significance in the greater scene/setting of the MCU. In fact there wasn't much stakes that carry through to the MCU and it seems very self contained. However I think that it is important to enjoy this movie as it is, the fun action sci-fi that is probably the funniest Marvel movie to date. The thing is we as audiences get so much superhero movies nowadays there is a case of superhero film fatigue and having large stakes in every single movie is just going to dilute out tastes. This current way, we can enjoy these characters in their own side stories/adventures and enjoy the big explosive moments when they come together, like a comic book crossover event! What Thor: Ragnarok does so well is that it really redefines the Thor franchise, the character of Thor himself and even the Hulk character. All the while maintaining the sense of fun and adventure. I did enjoy that they further characterized Hulk so he isn't just a raging monster but a simple minded character who has more complexity than is previously perceived. However, the comedy does come at the expense of certain climactic battle sequences and serious moments and this is sure to put certain audiences off. But overall, a thrilling, fun action movie that is sure to evoke certain controversies.",7,44,78,29 October 2017
Cloverfield," hey, that's actually pretty good
","Yes, Cloverfield's pretty good. IT had fast paced action with quite a good horror/monster movie premise. The monster was very well done the story makes sense, unlike lots of horror flicks that is just full of dumb people. It was actually scary and quite intense, it is a faced paced movie not an excruciating and long horror movie of some creepy baby attempting to murder someone for two hours. The found footage element was quite well done too, actually I feel that it elevated the movie a lot. In fact if we take that out it wouldn't be half as good as it was, obviously the whole mystery of not knowing what the movie is gonna be about was quite a marketing strategy. It really sort of creates an immersive and real-world vibe to the film.I watched cloverfield just as many others, not knowing what I am getting myself into but the outcome was great. In fact I must reiterate this movie I feel is as good as it is because of the nature of it and that great marketing strategy. Because no expectation= positive outcome even if it's not as good as it is. This is an example of how a movie going experience does not always start in the theatre and in fact the entire marketing campaign building up to it really helps make the experience a much better one. However I think that there are some flaws despite all of those positives, first of all as I have said the movie alone is not so good, it was quite well done but the marketing deserves a lot of credit. Second of all, I do wish that the monster was much better realised, perhaps more focus on the monster that could come with a slightly longer run time. But overall the positives definitely outweighs the negatives",7,1,1,18 March 2016
Ready Player One," Spielberg's new entry of childlike wonder and nostalgia
","Ready Player one captures some aspects of the wonder of game and fully utilized the sense of 80s nostalgia in a way that none other than Steven Spielberg would be able to. The film delivers a brilliant message about the purpose of gaming and perhaps an extended metaphor to life much like the way in which many of Spielberg's film presents big messages in relatively simple yet heartfelt and genuine narratives.Perhaps none other can helm such a project and not make us seem like a completely bloated film filled with attempts of selling the 80s nostalgia for commercial success.However, inspire of these praises to the film it does seem lacking in some areas too. I personally did not see the development of the characters or the sentimental values that characters hold, even though as previously mentioned Spielberg does manage to deliver that sense of genuine emotions and themes. It's just that in many cases these aren't delivered through the characters themselves.While simple but effective is often Spielberg's calling card in this case many of the story beats were predictable and thus unimpactful. Much like the recent 'BFG' which manages a good ideology but lacking in complexion and further intrigue. While the many references were certainly enough to have fans dig through frame by frame for ages there also just was this sense of underuse and lack of purpose of these characters. In other words they just seem to be there, of course it is impossible to fit all of this into the span of a movie but perhaps that is exactly why this was an absolute challenge for any director to take on.",6,1,3,5 April 2018
The Hateful Eight," Quentin Tarantino does it again
","Out of Quentin Tarantino's Western films, most notably Django Unchained and the Hateful Eight personally I think that the hateful Eight tops Django. Why? Well though Django definitely tops at being completely extravagant and completely insane killing sprees it lacks the intricacy that I feel The Hateful Eight has. It does have substance, while Django is much more of style over substance. That is not to say that the Hateful Eight lacks the Western style and tone that Tarantino gets on point, just as Tarantino always delivers the Hateful Eight is no different, exciting actions and exhilarating fast paced story is vintage Tarantino. The Hateful Eight really is like a game of 'clue', what's great is that it does that very well and keeps us guessing throughout. The end game was not predictable and any of the 'eight' could've been the 'bad guy' or perhaps all of them. When the guessing games are over we still get an amazing Tarantino styled shoot out and confrontations (no spoilers) it was quite impeccable, I love that ending and final act reveal. It captures the sense of danger of the era much better than much any Westerns that I have seen while still being fun and exciting. Samuel L Jackson performance is probably my favorite, one of the biggest mysteries of the eight and all. His monologues were delivered with such power and was just so well done I really expected him to be an Oscar contender. In addition this time round he is a lot more likable than 'Django Unchained's Stephen the butler'. Samuel Jacks had great flair just as all of the characters. Another one of my favorites is Kurt Russell who owned the scene whenever he was in, while being fun and likable. Each character was so colorful and diverse. They had very clear character traits very different from one another making it very interesting to see their interactions with one another.The film like many of Tarantino's film has such diverse themes that are all executed in a way that gives the film so many directions and makes it so jam packed with essence and story. The score was also amazing, it seemed to fit so perfectly well with the mystery theme of the film and just had a pinch of excitement and fun in there as well. The music just is the film, it represented everything that the film represents. The setting of the story was set in this very isolated, cold location which gives a sense of fear and distrust through such a harsh surrounding.The dialogue in this film on a whole was amazing, especially in these character moments where one of the characters just break down the situation, it is so well written just as the ones in Django. Every time there were characters going on about the situation or some past or even when they were breaking down how they were about to kick-ass it was great. A lot like those Christoph Waltz monologues in Django. Fantastic dialogues and great characters make The Hateful Eight one of the best all year.",8,1,4,16 May 2016
"I, Tonya"," Decent bio-pic with brilliant performances
","I, Tonya had amazing acting and great chemistry amongst the cast as it brings us through a fun and entertaining story of Tonya Harding. The film deals with a subject matter from various points of views and is taken from the perspective of various characters. I found that this was a particularly effective and interesting way of depicting Tonya Harding's story that proved to be a brilliant device in depicting the complexities of the incident.The performances from Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan and Allison Janney were all brilliant, they all depict characters that are broken and they just come across as so uncomfortable but reliable at the same time. This all comes down to ating which was highly commendable, Margot Robbie's performance in particular was really great. Her performance encompasses a mixture of childlike naivete, absolute badassery and also the try hard lead. These all goes to depict the complexities of her character, the tenderness but also the toughness and grit of such a character. Allison Janney's performance just absolutely blurs the line of acting and reality, she complete dissolves into the role, depicting this stonewalling, stiff and harsh mother absolutely brilliantly. In a way that just makes her so unlikable, absolutely brilliant. I, Tonya was a great bio-pic, while it isn't the most exciting or amazing film it came with brilliant acting and a decent screenplay, at the very least it was fun and entertaining.",7,0,0,29 January 2018
Molly's Game," Delightfully intriguing bio-pic with excellent acting
","Jessica Chastain's performance in Molly's game has once again solidified her as a very solid actress. I genuinely enjoyed and related to her presence throughout the film in the way that she portrays the character of Molly Bloom. Chastain was able to show so many sides to the character, while wearing a sort of facade from the beginning of the filma nd allowing audiences to slowly peel back and unveil her characters until we really get an in depth look at her childhood and the events and relationships that made her what she is today. Along with Jessica Chastain's brilliant performance which was amazing we also got a very powerful performance from Idris Elba's Charlie Jeffery who showed so many dimensions as character, from loving father to stern lawyer.What I really liked about Molly's game is the way in which it told the story in such an intriguing but light way, while the subject matter is somewhat of a more serious one the film panders to the entertainment aspect of gambling and that really added to the narrative flow. Making it a lot more accessible and intriguing but also a lot more entertainingWhile Molly's game isn't groundbreaking in the sense of dealing with deep or sophisticated subject matters, it told a good story, had great acting and brilliant pacing. While, also dealing with the psychology of such a character of Molly Bloom and her interpersonal relationships adding a much needed layer of icing atop the cake. A perfect example of a well told story, told in a way that services the theme and adds value to the film.",7,2,5,7 February 2018
Moana," Expect a fun, good time. But has room for potential
","Moana is a beautiful and stunning film, the best parts of the film being the animation and the music, of course with Lin-Manuel MIranda on board this project. So Moana is actually an animated film that I've been following since they casted Auli'i Cravalho, I watched the clip released by Disney in which they told her that she got the part, along with Dwayne Johnson being on board I was immediately attracted to this project. I thought that it was really great that Disney decided to venture to a more different model for their Disney princesses brand and to explore a culture as fascinating as the Polynesian culture.The end result a brilliant film that is really just a fun exciting adventure. The voice acting was stellar both from new comer Auli'i or Dwayne Johnson and it was really great seeing their two characters on screen bonding and getting used to working together. The music in the film was fun and catchy with very meaningful lyrics without being too in your face and having the characters break into song every scene, the musical pieces were used sparingly and reasonably. So, I would like to compare this to two of Disney's recent properties. First of all: Frozen, Frozen was alright in my opinion, compared to Moana I do believe that Moana is for a slightly more mature audience and though Frozen touches on certain important and deep aspects regarding the love between siblings it seemed a much more introverted film. Of course perhaps due to the actual story of the film however there was always something that never clicked with me when it comes to Frozen and the vast openness of Moana seems to be the difference maker that made me enjoy this movie a lot more. The second film is last year's, Zootopia. Now this is a film that Disney has produced that I feel does a great job in conveying very mature themes. With a film like Moana, it is fun and adventurous but could do with in my opinion some more mature aspects, perhaps touch on issues such as environmental or deal with nature as it sort of already does. I do feel that things like that is the next step for Disney, to really put what they have done in Zootopia into practice on some of its other properties.",8,1,5,2 February 2017
BlacKkKlansman," Good blend of social issues and comedy
","I enjoyed Spike Lee's Blackkklansman that deals with racial justice and ridicules the over the top nature of the white supremacist group. I thought it was an interesting blend of comedy and drama, that by taking a serious topic like this and pointing out the ridiculous nature of certain things it really highlights the importance of certain social issues. With charming performances by John David Washington and Adam Driver this film was a very interesting look at the true story of Ron StallWorth.",7,0,4,9 June 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," The most accurate spiderman and one of MCU's best villain
","This is the third reboot of Spider man that we have gotten and after watching Homecoming I have just been wrestling with whether this is a good or a great movie in the MCU's line of films. What Homecoming does great was that it stayed true to the character more than any other rendition of Spider man, they managed to depict the awkward teenager that is Peter Parker in the most relatable and likable way. The reason why this particular Spider man is likely the best rendition of the character is because of how synonymous he is with the source material, the comic book Spider man who is constantly talking in fights, joking, enthusiastic and energetic was transferred to the silver screen perfectly. Spider Man Homecoming had a much more ground level feel to it compared to any of the grand scales of MCU's other films, the film sticks to the ground and is a lot more similar to the well acclaimed Marvel Netflix shows, in an age saturated by huge action films and spectacles going bigger and bigger this is exactly the self contained and feel good superhero movie that audiences can enjoy and relate to.Homecoming doesn't directly shift forward the MCU but like the Guardians of the Galaxy focuses on telling the individual character's story, Marvel is taking us back to basics where superhero franchise films don't have to be a 'Civil War' where there are stakes that involve the entire MCU and that features an entire roster of characters. But does this mean that Homecoming is a great film? My initial thoughts are that is is good but not great however after some time I think that Spider man Homecoming is in fact a great film, here's why: One thing that the MCU has been struggling with post Avengers is its villains, as any Batman fan knows, Joker is what makes Batman and this underlying lack of villains who can stand against his/her hero is sure to be something that will come back to haunt the MCU. The lack in these character's incentives is just one example of poor villains, examples include, Ronan the accuser, Ego, Ultron, Nebula, Baron Zemo, Modo, Crossbone, Dormammu, Malekith, The Mandarin. The villains of MCU are misused and underdeveloped and what distinguishes Homecoming from the bunch is its villain, I adored Michael Keaton's performance as The Vulture, a villain that on paper seems dull and in no way a match for Spider man yet they made it work. They gave the villain just as much time to develop a character as they did the hero this is what creates a balance between them and have us understand their motives which is why the vulture worked so well as a rival that can absolutely stand toe to toe against Spider man. Ultimately this factor in my opinion elevates this film and is why I think that it deserves to be highly praised.",8,4,10,12 July 2017
Suicide Squad," a fun time at certain times
","I would say that this is definitely a step up from BvS but it would seem that DC just can't get it right ever since the legendary Dark KNight trilogy. BvS had clear issues of trying to fit in way too much story while Suicide squad had really messy editing topped off with a clichéd and poor third act. The best part about the film was by far its characters, because really that's all that Suicide Squad has got. The entire first act consists of a couple of scenes where Amanda Waller talks us through the backstories of each of the characters which seems pretty ridiculous to me and a pretty odd choice. While the last act basically has the clichéd faceless army battle where the main characters fend off hordes of 'faceless people' just as we have seen time and time again.Harley Quinn and Deadshot were pretty good , Deadshot as the leader of the team was given an emotional backstory to make him seem like more of a redeemable character. Harley Quinn as, well Harley Quinn should be it was like she stepped right out of the comics and the Arkham games.Other members of the squad including captain boomerang was quite funny as a sort of comedic relief but that is basically it. El Diablo's backstory was quite intriguing too, as this man who has so much pain and fear of his own powers makes him also quite relatable and sort of down to earth despite being one of the only metahumans on the team. I do feel that Katana id quite underutilized as she has so much more potential instead of just being the crazy woman who talks to her sword.My biggest problem was with Enchantress, now from the trailer I would've said that Enchantress was the best part. Her transformation between June Moone and the Enchantress couldn't be handled better, it was really cool. However her powers and her as a villain was handled very poorly. For example her summoning this brother person and summoning the faceless legions and all, seems quite pointless and all. There wasn't really a purpose in which this villain is pursuing which makes her pretty meaningless. It is also quite ridiculous how everyone is fighting all around her while she spends more than half of the film wiggling around doing some sort of yoga thing. This whole Enchantress thing and the fact that we never understand the significance of this city that is being destroyed makes the entire film seem pretty pointless. If you think about it what is the point, Enchantress doesn't seem to care really and neither does the Suicide Squad so what is the point really? Another controversy is Jared Leto's Joker, this whole mobster look is quite a creative take on the classic joker, a spin on the great performance that Heath Ledger has gave us but we really didn't get enough of him to make much of a judgment as to how he really did, but I would say that as far as what we got to see he seems pretty good. Overall I think that there are redeeming factors but the storyline is extremely jumpy and messy and the story is quite meaningless and poorly crafted..",5,0,2,27 August 2016
Doctor Strange," A weaker entry from the MCU
","As a Marvel fan I will have to admit that Doctor Strange is one of the franchise's weaker entries along with Thor the dark world and some of its earlier solo pieces. The film had no focus and the pacing was off a lot of times.However to start of I would like to point out the positives, One of the most well done parts of this film is establishing the absurdist, strange and sometimes trippy world of the famed sorcerer supreme. As the recent All new all different doctor strange storyline does so very well this side of the Marvel universe is being represented quite well, in the comic book continuity and in the Marvel cinematic universe we are really seeing Doctor Strange in a sort of return to forms with all of this absurd and all around 'strange' world that is the mystic and interdimensional side of the Marvel universe. I think this was a good approach and representation to the interdimensional side of this vast comicbook continuity.Another job well done would be in my opinion Benedict Cumberbatch, he is an actor who can sometimes be really good as one that everyone loves to hate and hates to love. The 'Draco Malfoy' of movies, BC as he quite often does portrays this snobbish know it all character in a great way that makes audience really find him annoying and overly arrogant. Now as BC so often portrays this character type I wouldn't say that this is some sort of a major acting breakthrough but all I can say is I guess it was a good casting choice for BC to play Doctor Strange.Now the movie also as mentioned have several flaws one of them being a flaw that has been throughout the entire MCU, the villains. Once again we find ourselves in an MCU film where the villain has the most simplistic plans and is defeated by the most basic things, in the sense that they don't seem to pose any major threat at all. We did get introduced to the character of Dormammu but my god, the moment I saw him on screen it immediately reminded me of Galactus from 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer', Why MCU? Can you not have a good villain other than Loki. The film constantly foreshadows and references this coming villain but when he finally shows up he barely does anything at all. Just no. I guess the MCU can never have a good villain so they'll just have to keep bringing back Loki.The pacing of the film was off too, scenes can sometimes be dragged along really slowly and at times days would go back in the matter of seconds. It really just seems like things sort of pop out left and right with no correlation. I haven't even mentioned the many impracticalities and parts that didn't make much sense at all. The story as the foundation/backbone of this film was sloppy and not done very well at all. But it does manage to get the job of establishing a different side of the MCU and a new character: Doctor Strange done.Overall, yes this is probably one of the weakest MCU films but it isn't completely irredeemable, it can be hard sometimes to do origin stories so I would expect a second entry to be a lot better simply because this established world of Doctor Strange is a very interesting side to explore in my opinion and the character of Doctor Strange was established quite well as well which does make me quite excited for the following films where we actually see Strange interact with the other members of the MCU.",6,11,33,25 October 2016
Full Metal Jacket," Wonderfully thought provoking
","Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is celebrated as one of the best depictions of the Vietnam War and perfectly captures the dehumanizing process of war. The movie is essentially split up into two halves, the first half set in a bootcamp and depicting the main characters being humiliated and hardened into killing machines for the US marines. While the second half focuses on the soldiers after they have been deployed in VIetnam and now the war has a dehumanizing effect on the soldiers.The performances are great, from Vincent D'Onofrio's pvt. Pyle to R. Lee Ermey's Sgt. Hartman to Matthew Modine as Pvt. Joker, all of whom delivered stellar performances that indicate the great machine that is the military boot camp system and war as a whole, its effects on the human psyche.Over the years there has been countless analysis and breakdowns of Full Metal Jacket, its themes and what it all means. I think that just goes to show the brilliance of Kubrick, to him it isn't about giving audiences a question and an answer but to present us with a rhetorical question that we can sit with and discuss amongst each other. I really enjoy the ambiguity of each key scene yet it is presented in such a way that as an audience you wouldn't just take for what it is, there is a sense that everything means more than face value and thus, is the beauty of Full Metal Jacket.",8,2,2,8 June 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Wonderful and subtle exploration of human emotions
","Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is a wonderful and subtle exploration of the human experience, rage and how we deal with pain. The cast gave amazing performances that goes to present this theme of blind rage and letting go. The film takes place in the small town setting featuring a small group of cast that were all very impactful and were each well defined and have very human and authentic emotions. I particularly enjoyed the cinematography and these use of the colours of orange and blue to create this contrast of emotions. Each character was a given a significant arc that involved the themes of redemption and growing. With the film ending on a note where characters who have now changed and evolved throughout the film are faced with a decision and essentially leaves the audience to make up their own mind on what happens next. It was a brilliant way to end the film. In particular, Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell were the highlights of the film, with honourable mention: Woody Harrelson. The way in which McDormand balances a hard outer shell and the soft, vulnerable side of her character was great to behold, an enjoyable performance featuring her tough gritty attitude and her grief of loss. While Sam Rockwell brilliantly balanced two personalities too, he played a character that was highly irritable, hated and immature, yet in other scenes he is depicted in a righteous, brave and selfless sense. Wonderfully portrayed to make the audience believe in the changes in the character. This is a film with a lot of heart, and depict the small town feel brilliantly. The use of comedy adds so much to the film in aiding its authenticity and connection to the audience, a wonderful, 'slow-burn' feel with complex and intense drama.",8,1,5,24 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," In my opinion, a satisfying end to the Skywalker Saga
","The final chapter in this sequel trilogy and a conclusion to the 'Skywalker Saga', Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker has been seen as a let down. However, I actually really enjoyed this installment in the franchise, as someone who was never the biggest fan of Star Wars, I never had that sense of nostalgia from seeing any of the sequel trilogy and I felt as a result was able to enjoy the film as they were. There is certainly an argument to be made that as the ending to a saga it should definitely pay off on and make congruent and logical storytelling flow from that of its predecessors. But because I never felt such a strong attachment to the franchise I thought as it is, Rise of Skywalker was a really good movie, with exciting action and sci-fi elements and a narrative that ultimately centers around the fight between good and evil.It was an effective film that while may be seen as style over substance at times, does have its fair share of substantial moments that make the argument of what it means to be a Jedi or Sith and what it means to bring balance to the force. I think it wonderfully comes full circle in that it brings us back to our internal struggles between blind rage and tranquil control, the essence of the two factions. At the end of the day, regardless of how convoluted of a plot it was getting here, the story devices and convenient character traits and decisions it was an entertaining film.I really enjoyed this movie and felt that there were a lot of brilliant moments in this film, while I understand the criticisms, I can't help but like what I saw.",8,3,15,23 December 2019
Lion," important, informing and relevant
","Lion stars Dev Patel and Sunny Pawar and tells the emotional and miraculous true story of 'Saroo' an Indian child who finds his way back home after 25 years of being separated from his family and adopted by an Australian family. The performance from the child actor Sunny Pawar was really great, his emotions and deliveries were all on point, His performance was heartfelt and heartbreaking, his fear and sense of isolation were done very well in the scenes where he first separates from his family, how he was depicted walking through the crowds, the sheer size comparison alone pacts such a strong effect. I really liked this movie because of how it was able to deliver an emotional and powerful story, the emotions from the child's point of view and also in the later act with Dev Patel depicting a victim of trauma and the feeling of lost and the idea of searching for self purpose and his own roots were great. The excruciating process of trying to grasp that thread of memory digging through a dark pool of nothingness. Also the guilt that he feels for not having contacted his family all well explored and acted out. The film also does a great job exploring India's poverty, the scene depicting a child snatching group was not only informing but relevant and impactful. Delivering an overall message of the amount of children that are lost in India each year at the end of the film, presumably falling into the hands of such criminal groups. This isn't necessarily a very commercially viable movie, but it is as mentioned very important and explores the darker corners of the world and human nature.",8,0,3,9 March 2017
The Lost City of Z," Unconventional, yet an all encompassing recount of the intriguing search for the Lost Cities of the Amazons
","After coming out of the gates strong, but then slipping in terms of reviews I went into The Lost City of Z intrigued but unsure of what I would come out with. I must say I felt that The Lost City of Z was extremely fascinating and interesting, it is a well adapted recount of the life of Colonel Percy Fawcett. I found this film to be bold and tackles multiple themes in its long runtime of over 2 hours, a factor that may have caused the film to drag a bit yet I still enjoyed it quite well. Firstly the cinematography was amazing, the crew has spent time shooting in the Amazons and there is a real payoff that can be seen in the final works, all the scenes filmed in the jungle was magnificent. The acting from the more minor characters such as Tom Holland as Jack Fawcett and Sienna Miller as Nina Fawcett were great whenever they are on. But, I must talk about the two leads; Charlie Hunnam as Percy Fawcett and Robert Pattinson as Henry Costin. I really, truly don't get it. I do not get the Charlie Hunnam hate, I've seen this in the reviews for this film and also saw this for his role in King Arthur. I personally enjoyed his performance very much, in Arthur I found his charismatic and comedic whereas in the lost city he delivered quite well also, he manages the role quite well despite poor aging makeup (I finer detail that is a rather minor point). I felt that his emotions towards his family came through in his portrayal and I truly did not see him as a dull act. Now, Robert Pattinson on the other hand was just amazing, and this was truly a surprise after being bored through the entirety of the Twilight saga. He plays this grizzled and experienced character of Costin impeccably and this came as such a surprise because the character looks nothing like Pattinson's usually perceived young and sexy image. A true sign that Pattinson can pull off much more complex roles. So about the narrative itself which has been pointed out as poorly written I once again disagree, I found the story of the search for a hidden city extremely intriguing. The film deals with the theme of a questing adventurer quenching the audience's thirst for action and adventure but also tackles more profound themes also. It deals with the theme of obsession through Fawcett's undying need to find such a hidden city, to the point where it leads to the struggle between whether or not such a city existed at all. The film deals with the theme of 'the journey', the idea that the search/journey is more important than the destination and gave much character development and emotional development as the characters travel through the Amazons. There are themes of family, a man's duty, gender roles, the classic 'hero's journey' all sprinkled in yet all were dealt with accordingly and appropriately. It did not become a case where a film tried to encompass everything and end up in a mess precisely because of the extended run time and the expertly devised roles each idea played, none had too much of a presence to overtake the central theme of the film and that's why for me The Lost City of Z truly worked and is quite a masterpiece. This is unconventional filmmaking, is is a bold move from director James Gray. I cannot say that it paid off for everyone but personally it worked for me and I enjoyed this fascinating adventure film.",8,2,7,15 June 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Messy pacing, but worthwhile?
","Bohemian Rhapsody had great music, an excellent performance my Rami Malek and creates an amazing atmosphere that makes viewers feel like they are at the concerts. It is this incredible combination that makes Bohemian Rhapsody such an enjoyable and entertaining watch.While the film definitely delivers whenever Queen were performing, they can't always be on stage and whenever they are not I can only say the the pacing is slow at times and may even seem formulaic. How many times have we seen a movie about a band that hits every checkpoint as they do in Bohemian Rhapsody. You got the simple pattern of, 'formation of band, label disapproval, success, descension, lead goes away, lead fails and abuses drugs, returns to sing kumbaya. I mean, seriously, outside of the eccentricity that is Freddy Mercury brought alive through Malek's performance, the rest of the movie can be seen as quite a drag.But, the movie still got me singing along and on an absolute Queen craze afterwards, so I guess they did something right.",7,2,3,13 November 2018
Baby Driver," A truly unique blend of music and action
","Baby Driver is a wonderful action film, another accolade under Edgar Wright's brilliant career in filmmaking. Baby Driver is a magnificent blend of car chase and music complete with amazing and interesting characters. You know that feeling when there is a particular tune or melody that gets you grinning? Well, Baby Driver is exactly that, the way that every action and shift follows the beat of the music just creates such an interesting storytelling form. Ansel Elgort was probably at his best in this movie, perhaps proving that he can move out of the YA genre. Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx played really great support roles too. Baby Driver just manages to pack in so much fun, intense action/car chase sequences but also hits the emotional points creating a truly unique and enjoyable cinematic experience.",8,7,14,29 August 2017
Justice League," Unfortunate, elementary narrative
","Justice League is quite a disappointment in spite of some triumphs that it does have. For starters, I did find Justice League to be worst than Batman V Superman, a great surprise to myself as I did not think it possible. But, this does make me appreciate Batman V Superman more than I did, I think a lot is to do with the tone as both films had pretty poor storytelling. I recall that even though I did not enjoy BvS I really liked what they tried to do there, a darker more serious tone is what I feel the superhero genre needs. However, they couldn't capitalize with a good coherent story so that led to BvS' demise. In Justice League's case there is a strong attempt at comedy and a lighter story which really rubbed me the wrong way, I found The Flash's character slightly nearing annoyance several times and felt that both Aquaman and Wonderwoman were unfortunately slightly underutilized. It seems that following the success of the much lighthearted Wonder woman along with Joss Whedon onboard the DCEU is going for such a fun high action movie. Yet, unfortunately it doesn't capture that Marvel spark and the characters just seem goofy, clunky and comical. The special effects did not help with this at all furthering this cartoonish texture that is seen in the characters in spite of some pretty solid acting across the board, which is unfortunate. However, the worst part has to be the story, while it isn't in coherent like in Suicide Squad or BvS it was very weak, the villain Steppenwolf did not help this at all. It is just an over all very simple plot with a very dull, clichéd villain that resulted in a film that although had bits of fun action sprinkled through and certain feel-good moments had this overarching sense of simplicity. I believe that the superhero genre must change in order to sustain as a film genre and in order to do this a brand like the DCEU has to adapt that dark tone that it had previously in order to distinguish itself from the plethora of superhero films we have today. Personally, comedy isn't the way and I particularly enjoyed the old worn out Bruce Wayne/Batman that we saw in BvS and I think that, that is the way for the DCEU to go.",4,0,2,18 November 2017
The Revenant," A cinematic experience
","After being left for dead the main protagonist Hugh Glass sets out on a path of vengeance on the ones who has left him to die. Based off of the incredible true story of fur trapper Hugh Glass.This film is gritty and rugged, watching Leo's Hugh Glass pull himself through the brutalities and struggles you could really feel the pain and agony of this character. The geography of the location is epic and the sheer size and spectacle of the landscapes really reflects the journey that Hugh Glass has to take. Watching the movie really immerses the audience with this environment that Hugh Glass has to push through.The Revenant had such amazing cinematography and was just beautiful, an incredible feat when considering that the entire film was shot under natural lighting. Through using the lighting of the different natural elements it makes the film feel so much more organic and really makes it an immersive experience. The wilderness and remote locations where these scenes were shot are spectacular. This film needed to be shot entirely under natural lighting to do this landscape justice. Watching everything Hugh Glass is put through and this journey he takes, this is something different. The sheer epicness and scale of the film was definitely worth the ticket. This film was not only gritty and violent but gets really disturbing, you just see this man against nature throughout the entire film. Glass goes through punishment after punishment, you really see how small he is amongst this vast landscape yet he stays in there time after time. This one man is being pit against this entire landmass (very well shown as this grand environment through the cinematography) it is a film of human accomplishment. One of the scenes involving a bear was one of the most amazing and brutal scenes I have ever seen yet it wasn't over the top and is instead very realistic which I feel is a great thing the pull off in addition to all the other amazing work done in this film.Leo Dicaprio is really good in this film too, he pulls of this character who is mostly isolated in this film and even with other people around barely says anything. His physical performance sold all of these emotions, while he was paralyzed you could just see his struggling and agony of unable to do something or move. When he is pushing through all of these challenges he was shaking, shivering and absolutely in pain yet his facial expressions tell another story, a focused attention and a very clear target. All of this combined makes it so exciting yet realistic at the same time. Terrific acting, great cinematography and gritty action makes this film amazing. One of the only flaws would probably be its prolonged run time as the second act could get kinda repetitive but overall it was great amazing style and doesn't lack substance either. Watching The Revenant was an immersive experience, it is more than just a third person look at a story but audiences are really indulged is this environment.",8,0,2,16 May 2016
Split," One of the best character performances in a great psychological thriller
","'Split' is M. Night Shyamalan return to forms. It was really a character act, upon viewing it really does seem like a sort of supervillain origin story (the ending does sort of reveal /confirm this). The way that the film depicts the character of Kevin is stellar due to the acting and narrative flow. I thought that this is a very solid psychological thriller, one that we haven't gotten a lot of recently. The film manages a steady pace with a very intense theme that is enforced by the films brilliant score. This was something I really liked, the build up to the reveal, the way we slowly peel away at this character. However I do feel that the trailers sort of spoil it for us and it might be more effective if nothing is given away however that probably wouldn't work marketing wise. The way that James McAvoy depicts each individual personality is amazing, the way he contorts himself, squeezes his brows together or stand upright, subtle details like that make it a performance to watch out for. The female lead, Anya Taylor-Joy was also really good in her role and was great at depicting this cold, broken individual. The way she intuitively was able to calmly decipher the situation and identify what to do made her character great. The film really thrives at unravelling these two character's past in a very great way.However once we enter the last act where the final personality dubbed 'the beast' is unleashed i feel the film starts to go down hill, this is the most action heavy part of the film however it may be pushing the boundaries a little with the development of the personality. It was horrendous to see how this such well crafted and built up character crawl around on walls like spiderman. This was a really kind of off putting ending however it was well resolved in terms of having an amazing epilogue in which kicks off with Taylor-Joy's character giving a final emotional stare, as she contemplates which is worst, returning to her abusive and sexually harassing uncle or to have just been locked up here for ever.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Amazing Spider man story that continues Peter Parker's legacy
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a treat and a real surprise, I had little expectations going in but ended up getting a very fun and exciting animated, action Spidey adventure. This movie is also bound to excite any who were fans of Spiderman or the Spider-verse comic series released recently by Marvel comics. As a comic book fan it's always exciting and interesting to see different iterations of our favourite comic characters in comic books and this movie made it work seamlessly on the silver screen.Honestly, going in I did not think that this movie would work given that the characters are not as well established as something like the MCU with rich lore and backstory that supports its grand storytelling. It kind of feels like jumping pass the origin story and straight to the final chapter, but like I said before, kudos for making it work.The characters were all likeable and interesting variations of Spiderman, and I think that the reason it worked is that the movie played on the fact that the Peter Parker Spiderman story has been retold so many times over the years that they are not only self aware but uses it to their advantage. By showing us a version of Peter Parker who is older and grizzled, it breathes new life into the character's arc and brings us a much different story to what we are sued to.Miles Morales' portrayal was also great, allowing the movie to explore a new character to become Spiderman and furthering the legacy of the character, overall it was a great experience that was fun, and energetic.",8,0,1,19 April 2019
Dangal," Charming, informing and emotional
","Dangal is a very charming bio pic, I have been a fan of Aamir Khan's work ever since watching '3 idiots' and have since been a fan of many Indian films, which gets me quite excited to see this film. Dangal is well acted, directed, the music was great as well, but it seems to lack the depth that was so captivating in Aamir Khan's 3 Idiots or even in the more recent movie 'PK'.As a real-life inspired bio pic this film couldn't have been done any better, it is a feel good story and focuses heavily on a father- daughter relationship, an element of the film that brings lots of emotions to the table. As many of Aamir's work there are often these very emotional elements and like he has done before he has succeeded in this film. This is an inspiring story and a very empowering film as well. The narrative flow of the story was good and I thought that the song choices were spot on, really helps building the emotions in this film.Aamir Khan's acting was amazing and so are the other Indian stars who I am unfamiliar with. Because of Indian film's tendencies to last for long durations there really is a chance to tell this story in immense detail which helped to elevate its narrative without drifting away into any irrelevant details. But that really is all that is to say about this particular film, it works well as a sports/drama biopic and is well made, the thing is there is nothing much to it other than that, Aamir Khan's film has a tendency to explore important ideas and to really be able to delve deep into them, while there is the central theme of sexism in India and acts as a powerful social commentary unlike his previous bouts this really isn't as inspiring. So in conclusion this is an amazing film and deserves many praises however I feel that there is a definite room for improvement.",8,2,3,30 March 2017
Dunkirk," The immersive 'experience' of war that highlights human insignificance
","Dunkirk tells the well known British story of the decisive WWII battle held at Dunkirk, 'The Miracle of Dunkirk.' Dunkirk is a brilliant atmospheric drama/thriller, it serves brilliantly as to tell the story of a historical event from multiple perspectives through immersing audiences in the midst of the battle and the intensity of the atmosphere. Dunkirk made the stylistic choice to not let audiences get attached to any one character and truly is highlighting the horrors and struggles of the event itself. It focuses on the situation rather than the characters as most war film does, as a result we never get much backstory on any characters and many characters can be confusing to follow and connect with. However as I said this is a stylistic choice not a production flaw and it is a decision that I liked. I liked that Christopher Nolan chose a less conventional route to tell a war story and I think that this is a very interesting way of depicting an event that for the participants must seem extremely dire and helpless.Tom Hardy once again does an amazing job despite once again having half his face covered, yet he still manages to do such an amazing work with his eyes alone. Other than Hardy, Harry Style's acting debut also delivered well and I am looking forward to any of his future works. In fact it seems like a direct personal comment from Nolan to the audience of the true atrocities and horrors of war, by not highlighting the story behind these individuals they seem to lose significance and character almost as if they never existed, now this is a powerful statement in contrary to the clichéd war film trope that depict things like, valorous men charging into battle, widows and children receiving the country's honors, men sharing stories in the thick of battle. No, Nolan chose not to glorify war by showing us what great characters these people are but chooses to throw out the stone cold truth of the insignificance of men in the thick of war and under the mercy of fighter planes. In fact it is even highlighted at one point that prime minister Winston Churchill demands a certain amount of men to return as if they were just statistics and figures, this is a film that doesn't shy away from the political truths of war and serves to caution and remind us of the horrors of war, a reminder to audiences to get their head out of some sort of a dramatised glorified depiction of war.",8,7,13,28 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," one of if not the best
","One problem that Marvel will start to face is not one to be easily solved, more and more characters and egos. Sometimes it gets hard to track every character but indeed civil war does it extraordinarily in amazing 'Marvel' fashion. Characters had quite balanced screen times and input to the overall story and the action scenes of this movie is just stunning, the airport fight scene is the best movie fight scene ever which has really proved me wrong. After seeing the trailer and what little bits we got of that scene I assumed that Marvel's attempt to transfer a comic book splash page to live action looks ridiculous since there are only what 10 people charging at each other while in the comic books we get like 100 give or take 10 people. This has actually always been my concern since the movie was first announced I honestly never thought they would be able to pull off this comic book classic this early on in the development of the cinematic universe. But, am I glad that they did. I am very interested in finding out what the repercussions of this event would be on the development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel has nailed it again.",9,11,24,27 April 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A brilliant return to the world of wizardry
","Fantastic beasts and where to find them was great, it brings audiences back to the wizarding world of Harry Potter. We are introduced to this band of 'misfits' who end up having great synergy, this film has all of our favourite elements of Harry Potter without being the exact same thing. From the underdog/outsider characters that we all gravitate to, to the wonders of magic most notably presented through the character of Kowalski. Yes, Dan Fogler's Kowalski was surprisingly very good, not only was he the film's comedic relief and the sort of device used to explain magic to the audiences he was also great in the more serious and emotional roles. To the extent that towards the end of the film I really did feel for him and has grown very attached to the character, something that I have not expected when first introduced to him. Eddie Redmayne's performance was not groundbreaking here but he does a good job playing the 'outsider' role in the movie, the guy who no one seems to understand or cares to listen to which makes his friendship with Jacob Kowalski all the more precious. Another great delivery was from Colin Farrell as Graves, he isn't in this film much but whenever he is in a scene he definitely steals the spotlight, funnily enough a lot of times from the American minister of magic, Seraphina Picquery played by Carmen Ejogo. Quite a shame though because I did want to see this character shine and be of impact, but I guess as always the minister characters always seems useless in the world of wizardry. This film is written by JK Rowling herself which from my understanding is quite impressive as writing in different forms of media is not usually a successful transition. The writing in this film was really good, so kudos to Rowling for making a successful transition. Finally onto the beasts, I have heard criticisms on how the fantastic beasts seemed to be sidelined by the main story about the threat of the American wizarding world being revealed. However I would really disagree with that, I very much felt that the beasts and Newt Scamander was the main focus of the story while there was the underlying second arc on the revealings of the wizarding community and Geret Grindelwald. Now, I understand that Grindelwald would potentially be a large part of the upcoming films but in the case of this film that arc is definitely not the main arc but was instead introduced. The beasts definitely stole the show on this one.",8,5,10,26 November 2016
Yesterday," Ironically forgettable
","Coming into Yesterday hoping for a good and relaxing time, with classic Beatles songs, I ended up being rather disappointed. There was nothing wrong with the narrative pers se but unfortunately it doesn't hit that charm that many music centric 'small' films tend to bring. Perhaps it was the one too many Ed Sheeran 'cameo' that just seemed to distract from the main draw of the movie.In an already cliche genre and narrative Yesterday really doesn't do much to elevate its craft, it was a decent watch but ultimately one that would be easily forgotten.",6,2,5,11 August 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The Endgame
","It would be impossible to talk about this movie without spoiling anything, but this is truly the Endgame. Avengers: Endgame felt like the closing of a chapter and the culmination of a decades worth of movies and a truly epic saga. We have followed these characters for 22 movies and it has all led to this movie, a combination of heart wrenching drama and epic action sequences.As a comic book reader/fan there really is something about seeing a movie like this that evokes a certain emotion in you, while I have enjoyed pretty much all of the MCU films this and movie and the first Avengers did something that is entirely on its own level. In the Avengers, seeing the moment in which the Avengers first 'assemble', there is a very emotional response. This movie has a similar moment that evokes that same emotion of seeing the characters you have known and love from the comics come to life on the screen. Endgame truly felt like a large comic book crossover event that ties everything together satisfyingly.While this film definitely has 'plot holes' and flaws, to me it is a 10/10 film because I truly doubt that anyone would be able to recreate the magic that this film represents, 22 movies in over a decade, this saga represents more than a single cinematic motion picture can accomplish but elevates the artform of 'film' and forges its own category of epic sagas.",10,1,4,4 May 2019
District 9," I love prawns
","District 9 poses very interesting views on very real-life events from a surreal sci-fi direction, the issue of immigrants can be seen everywhere across the globe. The way the aliens were depicted in district 9 were very interesting in the way that it is showing the problems with drugs, crime and slums. These problems are very real and are definitely not just fiction. It's like lots of modern day cases where a high population of immigrants move to a country and all of the problems that they face, the struggles in their lives.The film discusses racism and discrimination, in terms of the lack of respect the humans had towards the aliens but also the racist name 'prawn'. In many ways it shows the inhumane ways of humans and the certain darker sides to the government where they do certain things to achieve their goals at any cost.I really liked the relationship between the two leads, Wikus and Christopher. It shows that despite the differences there are ones among us who could learn to embrace lose differences. And all that it takes is time, to be willing to put in time to understand each other and the differences that are held between us and we can find the good in each other.Finally I also would like to mention that I really enjoyed how the movie was depicted, the way is was made in a sort of documentary like way. It makes the whole thing seem like an actual current world crisis. The thing is by doing this I think that it is indeed pointing out that these cases are very real, slums, drugs and crime but also immigration, racism and discrimination. By making the movie's event very real world and seem like it is based on actual happenings it reflects the very real everyday cases that are just like the case with the prawns of this movie.",8,0,1,20 March 2016
Toy Story 4," The sequel we didn't know we needed
","Toy Story 4 is the sequel that little expected, in a franchise that ended with a brilliant period mark, from a studio that promised no sequels. Coming into the fourth Toy Story there are bound to be skepticisms, yet the movie definitely pulls through, going above and beyond. Toy Story 4 was a story about friendship, the relationships between the core cast of toys, and what it means to protect, look over someone and to let go.While the story of the toys may seem all but concluded, this installment has proved that there is yet more stories to tell and more lessons to give. Toy Story 4, was an emotional, exciting and hilarious film, that I had a great time watching.",8,32,60,2 July 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," The cumulation of a universe, 10 years in the making
","Avengers Infinity war was great for me as a fan of both the comics and the MCU ever since its inception. However, i can absolutely see the flip side of this, being a celebration for the past 10 years of the MCU it manages to embody the theme, tone, emotional stakes and attachment established in the past 10 years. Thus, for an audience who has barely seen any of the MCU films they might find it difficult, confusing and even just a storyline mess with no emotional stakes or attachment to the characters that I as a fan embody.Infinity war embodies all that comes before it and because of that it was able to deliver action, spectacle and a complete combustion of stories that it wouldn't be able to without this rich background and journey that has culminated to this moment.Despite all this, infinity war does still manage to weave in character arcs and development, characters like iron man, Scarlet witch, Star lord. All got meaningful character building arcs. While many other characters were unfortunately rather lost in the mix. But, these are just minor complaints considering how good of a job the Russos have already done in balancing stories, characters and handling brilliant action scenes. Considering the astronomical task of crafting the film there has to be characters that are more in the background and playing second fiddle, and I think that is perfectly acceptable. But arguably the films greatest victory is in Thanos, this is very much his story. Not only did we get a pure world conquering, villainous villain but we got to see so many sides to him. We saw brief moments of tenderness, but still see the menacing all conquering 'mad titan' that he is.more importantly, he had a motive that isn't of selfish origins. Thanos actually has a point and that creates an ability for audiences to understand where Thanos is coming from. This is something that marvel has had a huge issue with in the past but with Thanos and even the recent Killmonger perhaps marvel has finally found a way to fix its notorious 'villain problem'.",9,23,68,25 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino returns
","Tarantino's latest film starring Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and Margot Robbie has been hyped up for ages and was one of my most anticipated films of the year. To a certain extent the Tarantino esque filmmaking style is definitely a stable of this movie,from the over the top violence and dialogue to the small details seen in Tarantino's film. Once upon a time in Hollywood definitely delivered the familiar dose of Tarantino's style that was definitely the main draw and what I liked most about this movie.However, outside of that I did find that the pay off and converging storylines did not deliver the impact that most of Tarantino's movies do. It unfortunately ended up being rather bland and inconsequential, seemingly shoehorning in the Manson storyline for the sake of doing so, and writing an alternate history for the sake of doing so; rather than letting the characters drive the story.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood had great performances and tried introduced themes of duality and facade. Taking on the superficial 'look' of the glamorous Hollywood era of movie stars and examines this cultural phenomenon closely, however pales in comparison with Tarantino's impressive filmography.",7,0,2,29 September 2019
Beasts of No Nation," the unnamed spoils of war
","A very painful movie to sit through. Not because that it is bad, not at all. It was a very magnificent film. However some of the scenes and the things that the main protagonist, a child: Agu was put through and experiences is at times hard to watch. However unreal these things are it is hard to believe that in fact the film only reflects reality, the stone cold truth of some of these more rural regions in the world where political corruption, warlords, guerrilla warfare and child soldiers are a reality. This is a visually stunning film, completed with powerful lines delivered brilliantly by the cast. Abraham Attah who played Agu was a definite highlight in the film. Along with Idris Elba who gave a wonderfully disturbing performance. I think that it is very interesting that this whole event is set in an unnamed country and Idris Elba's character was simply named, 'commander'. In fact other than Agu I don't think there are any characters with a 'real name' they are either unnamed or has some sort of an alias. This to me has very special implications, it is a very interesting choice made I believe to represent that these people are simply, 'the spoils of war' those who are never going to be known or seen by the world. Which makes all of them and their experiences all the more meaningful.Oddly I would say that this film is a coming of age story. But instead of slowly gradually understanding how the world works through meaningful and enriching experiences, we have this character who is basically forced to grow up, he is thrown into a world of drugs, violence and death. At the end of the day he realizes that he can no longer return to his childhood he has lost that childish innocence. 'I saw terrible things... and I did terrible things. So if I'm talking to you, it will make me sad and it will make you too sad. In this life... I just want to be happy in this life. If I'm telling this to you... you will think that... I am some sort of beast... or devil. I am all of these things... but I also having mother... father... brother and sister once. They loved me.' This is a modern war film that reflects 'war' in this modern day and depicts the very true aspects that are ironically not seen or known by many. In many ways the character of Agu and the many child soldiers in these more rural areas are much more experienced. This is a visually stunning film, completed with powerful lines delivered brilliantly by the cast. Abraham Attah who played Agu was a definite highlight in the film. Along with Idris Elba who gave a wonderfully disturbing performance. I think that it is very interesting that this whole event is set in an unnamed country and Idris Elba's character was simply named, 'commander'. In fact other than Agu I don't think there are any characters with a 'real name' they are either unnamed or has some sort of an alias.

Mr. Nobody," we create our own reality......
","The film Mr.Nobody was very confusing in the beginning, skipping from one frame to another, one possibility of reality to another and you don't really see what's happening. However it is all done very beautifully and elegant. It focuses on this boy torn between his parents and has to make an important decision, go with his mother, or stay with his father. There was no set storyline as it is kind of the point, but a very powerful message that the film on a whole does manage to send is the repercussions of any decision. As you watch this film you sort of watch all of his decisions play out and what different versions of life he could have as a result of his decision at any given moment at any given time in his life. However I feel that this side is only just scratching the surface off what the true meaning is behind this film and there is in fact more depth to it than the importance of making decisions. However behind just the importance of decision making there is an idea presented by the film that these alterations and versions of his life is all as real as the other. It isn't necessarily how decision making can be very problematic but more of how all of the alternations already exist. When we see Nemo as an old man looking back at his life he remembers all of the different alterations and not just one set path, he even had the ability to talk to his younger self and alter his course of life. Nemo could affect what happens and will things to happen and that is a very important thing to think about.So what exactly does that mean, well I think it tears down what we see as time and space completely. Time is not a constant forward moving motion and what has happened can be reverted.There is not one moment but instead infinite moments in time which are happening at the same time with infinite possibilities. What is even more interesting is that we control that, we can decide for what we want and we don't live by the will of destiny or something. Not at all, but instead we will those things and happenings into existence, whether it's the fortunate moments or the misfortunes. Just as Nemo had the ability to change the course of his life, we too could create our own reality.",8,4,6,14 May 2016
Get Out," Brilliant directorial debut for Jordan Peele
","Jordan Peele makes his very interesting directorial debut in racial commentary/horror film 'Get Out'. I really enjoyed this movie, the lead Daniel Kaluuya was really good in this movie and he portrays such an interesting character. The supporting cast was also amazing including, Betty Gabriel who plays the housekeeper Georgina. What was really great about Get Out is its ability to blend comedy with horror tropes, so this is really something to congratulate Jordan Peele on in his directorial debut and it would be very interesting to see what he has to come. I believe that many of Jordan's personal experiences come through in this film as well, I do believe hearing Jordan Peele commenting in one interview about how he often feels uncomfortable if he was the only black person amongst a group of white people. That sense of paranoia really comes through and is fully understandable and relatable for a non-white viewer like me. However Jordan Peele takes a more comedic route with this adding some light heartedness to an otherwise serious topic.The horror and underlying mystery of this movie was also really great and the build up to the ultimate reveal was a very good process of which tension arise, so the horror aspect was taken care of also.",8,9,17,28 April 2017
Room," disconnect with society
","I really enjoyed Room, Room had the ability to create a sense of suspense within a 'room'. A sense of mystery, I was quite interested in the idea of this 'room' which if thought about is quite a bizarre idea. As it did occur to me that it is quite strange that a man had kidnapped a minor and proceeded to keep her alive in his shed, eventually impregnating her and continue to pay for all expenses of her and this child. All in all, despise the odd premises it is an intriguing story on coping with the outside world. For 'Ma', someone who has experienced it but has been detached from it for several years and 'Jack',one who has never been a part of it. I do believe that Jacob Tremblay's portrayal of the boy Jack was quite well done, I was sold at his bewilderment of seeing the outside world and the impacts that has been inflicting on him after being exposed to the false belief that the room is everything. It's got this whole idea of new things versus the old familiar things and the idea of the fear of new experiences. It also deals with the problem of post traumatic stress on Brie Larson's 'Ma' and her trying to cope with the world despite her experiences of potential rape and having been kidnapped for such a long time. It is clear that there is a disconnect which brings viewers to the next theme of a sense of belonging and fitting in. Overall I do recommend it for people who like films with more thinking required but this is definitely not your average popcorn flick.",8,1,5,28 February 2016
The Lion King," Basically The exact same thing
","The live action, animated remake of The Lion King, is..... Good? Well, it's the same exact story with the same exact shots, a little shaving here and a little extra there but essentially an almost shot for shot remake with photo realistic animation of animals. Which begs the question: when will Disney stop this train of remakes of classic Disney films and what is the point. Especially since Disney's main studio generally still puts up excellent original content, you can't help but wonder how far this is gonna go. Unnecessary and a waste of time especially since from the get go it was set up for failure, as it would never have bested the original.",6,2,4,11 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Brilliant and intense atmospheric horror
","A quiet place was a brilliant atmospheric horror, the sense of fear and danger and anticipation of the next bad thing to happen was just absolutely intense and overwhelming. I sat in the theater not daring to eat my popcorn in fear of the noises that I would make, on the one hand because the movie was pretty much complete silent for the first act and second of all due to the intense and eerie aura that the film manages to project with the early defining scene that was shown in the trailers. John Krasinski and Emily Blunt were brilliant in their roles, their chemistry from being a real life married couple can be seen in their interactions and in one particular, more intimate scene. But the child actors Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds were just as good. I recall last seeing Noah Jupe in 'Wonder' where the actor caught my eye being able to convey emotion and exacerbate a sense of genuinity with relative ease. This can absolutely be seen once again in a quiet place, his fear and intensity were so well expressed. All this without saying more than a couple of lines, it's simply a great accomplishment on the part of all the actors involved. A quiet place manages to set itself aside from classic horror films in two major ways, one: its heart and two: the people are not stupid. These are genuinely believable characters who act in reasonable, measured ways that does not make them look like complete idiots in a way that few horror films ever do. And the emotion and heart, the deep relationship and bond between these characters was both beautiful and devastating at times. A quiet place is a wonderful watch that is sure to put audiences at the edge of their seats.",8,4,9,5 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," The utmost form of love, and the pain that allows us to grow
","Call me by your name takes place in Rome one summer when a 17 year old adolescent played by Timothée Chalamet is transfigured by a bond with a college-grad played by Armie Hammer in a somewhat forbidden but beautiful relationship. Call me by your name is about the tenderness of first love, the depth and long lasting marks that love leaves you with and the utmost form of desire and ownership to be one with another. This was a brilliant film that takes its time to slowly burn through the summer in Rome but to harshly cut to the departure and ending, as out of nowhere as the beginning. A transcending dream like state as viewers follow Elio through his summer. Indeed, As an audience you often don't appreciate as much until it is gone towards the very end. This film captures that state and creates an euphoric and erotic journey about identity and love. Call me by your name was wonderfully embodied and captured by the two leads, Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet. First of all, Armie Hammer portrays his character of Oliver to a level of brilliance and perfection, smoothly and mesmerizingly slipping from the firm, boisterous character in public to the tender, thoughtful character in his privacy. Whereas Timothée Chalamet perfectly blends shy and defenceless with a sense of taking charge and trying to seem more 'grown up' or more 'mature'. Both of these performances were definitely what makes the film such a great watch, adhering to the cinematic trope of 'show don't tell' as a matter of fact, the acting work was transpired ever so brilliantly with the simple dilation of the eye and slightly awkward movements. Call me by your name at its core is about conflict and confusion, specifically those in one's tender age of adolescent. The lack of identity is a great theme that call me by your name wonderfully discusses. This can be seen through out by the deliberate contrast made in the artistic choices, from larger symbolic contrasts like Elio's logic sensibility in contrast to the irrational, sensual and illogical love and relationship that he forms with Oliver; and the seemingly logical, wise and systematic parents of Elio to the relationship of the leads. Down to details such as the pattern of Elio's shirt, with faces representing the many identities, and therefore lack f identity in the character.But, also at the center of this film is the love between Elio and Oliver most symbolically represented by the title of the film: Call my by your name, an action referred to in several points of the movie. A quote seemingly the utter opposite of self identification is the core of the film, the idea of which the largest extent of love is the complete segregation from 'I' and the transition to 'us' an almost ironically tragic idea to present to Elio considering his own lack of identity.In fact, as the film does illustrate to the very end this sense of confusion and pain and tragedy that befalls him is in fact the utmost importance in his journey to maturity. An overall message so wonderfully delivered directly through Michael Stuhlbarg riveting monologue in the final act of the film. He says: 'We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything - what a waste!' A chilling and riveting message to the audience, of the value in hurt and the importance of pain. So, call me by your name can certainly be considered a sad, tragic, heartbreaking film. But in fact, the message that comes through is that the pain is what allows us to grow.",8,0,3,13 January 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Fun? perhaps, but really just the same old, same old.
","This film is very much mirroring of Johnny Depp's career, He has become so molded into a character actor who must play these over the top strange characters that his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow has really became dull and unnatural in a sense. On the other hand movies such as Black Mass does prove that Depp is able to pull off more emotional roles with more depth involved. So why is Pirates 5 very much like Depp's career as an actor, well personally I see this in many franchises as they extend to their 5th or 6th installments not to say that this is a certainty but it is often seen, the case where each sequel follows that same formulaic structure that all the predecessors follow, there's no new blood; Well in the case of the 2 latest Pirates movies there is an attempt of doing so but the filmmakers are so afraid of putting these new character forward that they simply get drowned By Captain Jack. So yes Pirates 5 was fun and yes it was enjoyable but really it went nowhere whatsoever. About Depp and Jack Sparrow his performance in this film just seems like the same old thing, and what was once legendary now seems tiresome, annoying and ridiculous. He is no longer a groundbreaking performer but someone who is attempting to 'rekindle the fire' and the desperateness, it shows. Also the 'young couple' that Sparrow must team up with are very under utilized and may have been great, I really can't tell because of how little their characters were explored.I am personally a supporter of the second and third installments of this franchise and I think the biggest reason why is that it progresses the story further, whereas these past 2 films really just went nowhere and seemed like side quests in this greater main plot line. This leaves me wanting to move back to the main storyline desperately, I do hope that with the addition of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner in this film we may see a return to forms and a continuation of a story. Afterall I think what was so compelling in the franchise's early days was how there was a sense of adventure and questing as audiences leap from film to film.",4,2,5,12 June 2017
Hidden Figures," A well made biography/historical film about very important figures in American history
","Hidden Figures was a well told biography/historical film. A story set during a time of segregation and racial prejudice. It was a very impactful film that depicted a glorious feat in American history during an inglorious period in American history.This film is great in depicting this struggle of African-Americans during this time period in which there were these indifferences in the ways that they were treated, it is about how these women stood up for themselves and made a difference rather than put up with such prejudices. This film thrives the most at doing things very simply and down to earth, no big moments were necessary, it was just a steady telling of this story which fitted very well with the plot of the film. This is probably the most down to earth space film out there.Another field in which makes Hidden figures so great is its excellent cast, every single cast member played so brilliantly. The transformation that Taraji P. Henson underwent in terms of her posture and approach were done so well to fit into the character of Katherine G. Johnson. Compared to some of her other roles you could very clearly see a distinct difference/transformation. From her semi-awkward speech to her constantly pushing up her glasses, all of these attention to detail make this a fantastic performance. The two female supporting casts, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae were great also. It was also quite hilarious seeing Jim Persons essentially playing his role of Sheldon Cooper here along sides Taraji P. Henson. Overall I believe the the film does a good job depicting this story and the fact that these are figures that many Americans never read about in the history books it really is true to the title of 'Hidden figures'. This surprising detail makes the events of the story all the more important and impactful to modern day audiences as they get to unravel and understand many 'hidden figures' that contributed so much to the United States and were such an important part of American history.",8,1,6,2 February 2017
Coco," The genuine, warm film that is sure to resonate with audiences deeply
","This pixar film really struck a personal chord with me, Coco has once again solidified pixar as the king of animation and family films. Over the years pixar has given us lots of warm emotional stories but none quite like Coco.Last year's Inside out was certainly great it had its defining moments and it definitely was a very good film, but, Inside out just doesn't have this personal touch that Coco captures perfectly, in fact I think Coco is one of if not the greatest Pixar film. The fact that after this movie I am simply able to forget about the atrociously long Frozen 'short' should go to show just how great it is. While, Coco isn't as innovative storytelling wise and had a rather foreseeable plot twist but. Rather than expanding outwards and reaching new and innovative stories like Inside out Coco does a complete 180 and delves deep into each individual that watches this film. It is such a simple but effective formula that I can't stop praising it, there really isn't anything new to this story yet, there is just something so genuinely warm and relatable in Coco. Coco had one of the most stunning animations, the details put into each character (especially mama coco) was breathtaking, but the use of vibrant colours was an amazing choice. In fact, viewing this movie you would almost forget that the subject matter here is somewhat of a morbid topic, yet similar to the spirit of dias de los muertos Coco captures that vibrant, lively attitude towards death. The soundtrack was also a highlight of Coco in fact, I am listening to Coco's soundtrack as I am writing this, they were not necessarily catchy but as the film as a whole is, genuine and sincere. Coco is about family and the importance of families, but its execution of such a 'cliched' topic is simply mind blowing and as I have said so many times in this review, to sum up this film, it is simply that sense of genuine sincerity that makes this film so real, so warm and so special in Pixar's ever expanding roster of films.",9,1,4,5 December 2017
Sing Street," The third installment of John Carney's musical films
","So apparently Sing Street is made by the people behind 'Begin again' and 'Once', two films that I have thoroughly enjoyed. A running theme throughout all three seems to be its theme of depicting musicians and their 'life of struggles'. All three are small budget but packs very meaningful stories completed with beautiful scores and wonderfully performed musical pieces.Sing street depicts a story of how music and creating music is a cure to the struggles of everyday life. The idea of Irish teens moving to London and the mainland to follow a certain ideal or dream is very much reflected in the story itself. Depicting the risk taking attitude of youth. At the same time featuring the excitement of the creative process and developing a creative idea into a physical medium.I am most impressed with the performance delivered by Jack Reynor, previously know for 'Transformers: Age of Extinction' where he did not have such a major role. His depiction of a washed up high school dropout is masterfully portrayed and his character acted as such a brilliant mirror to our main character, 'the failed predecessor'. To learn this character's back story through a burst of emotions from him really made the character possess so much more depth and it is all thanks to Jack Reynor's brilliant portrayal.This film was really great, continuing the trilogy of films that followed this sort of formula yet being unique in their own ways.",8,3,5,3 January 2017
Million Dollar Baby," not your classic 'Boxing movie'
","Million dollar baby is directed by Clint Eastwood and stars, Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank who all deliver amazing performances. Million dollar baby takes away from the classic, macho, Rocky esque boxing film. By having a female lead there really is a very unique and different vibe to the classics yet it still has the struggles and pains of pushing through to the top. I very much liked this sort of mismatch.Hilary Swank completely embodies the character of Maggie Fitzgerald, she never just plays as Maggie but instead would just 'be; her. From the very way that she never seemed to fit in and the awkward interactions she has with other characters very much makes her portrayal very relatable and special. Obviously one of the other most important essence in a good boxing film is the 'mentor/coach character' and Clint Eastwood nails it. I was very impressed as he has managed to pull off such a caring figure without giving off any mixed signals, it would seem that he genuinely cares for her and plays off this father figure so perfectly against the naive nature of Maggie. These two had this unique interactions that is really quite different to, say Rocky. While in Rocky we get a figure who really constantly pushes you, it really isn't quite like this father figure that Eastwood plays in this film. Because of Maggie's naivety Eastwood could really shine in this sense.This film also tackles the subject of death and whether to let go of the one's you love, releasing them from their pains and sufferings or to 'selfishly' preserve them because of many different reasons. I liked how this was tackled with a sense of seriousness and also in a very 'realistic' way. In fact overall this film was just so real and that's what I like most about it. There was no miraculous recovery or any of such and is in that sense very relatable and understandable. All in all this is another great, modern entry from Eastwood and probably my first introduction to actress Hilary Swank, who has very much captivated me and earned my cudos in her portrayal of Maggie.",8,0,2,25 September 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi puts a nail in the coffin that is the 'Old Star Wars', but it also comes with the new generation of cast that is the 'new Star Wars'
","The Last Jedi has opened with overwhelmingly positive reviews, which was an instant sign that I may be in for disappointment due to the film being overhyped and admittedly I didn't come out of the film being very satisfied. Personally, my instant response was negative towards the choice that took with several of the films characters, for instance the choice to very lacklusterly offing supreme leader Snoke when he has been built up in episode VII as the next big bad or the way that Luke was in fact using his 'Jedi hologram' to battle Kylo Ren in the final climactic battle which ended anticlimactically when Luke disappears into the winds in the first Jedi Temple. The thing is, this all goes against our expectations as fans, we have come to expect the force running through a major blood-line (Skywalkers), to expect this big menacing force of evil and impactful deaths. But, we did get all of these things, we got them in The Force Awakens, so after really thinking about the Last Jedi I think it really was a worthy entry. 
Many in fact complained that the Force Awakens was essentially the exact same as A new Hope, complete with its own death star, an evil sith with its own version of Vader: Kylo Ren and the comparisons do not end there. It was a nostalgic film, harkening back to the nostalgia of Star Wars and was definitely effective for an initial return to such a franchise. However, Rian Johnson certainly realizes the danger of this and chooses to go on a very different and offbeat tone for The Last Jedi. The Last Jedi was an ensemble of storylines that were meaningful (perhaps with the exception of Finn and Rose's arc) and character building arcs that ended with every character being more that what we came in with, and this is a truly difficult balancing act that I think The Last Jedi executes very well. Albeit there are moments that at first viewing may seem odd and completely undermines the build up of A Force Awakens and a few unnecessary comedic scenes. You see as fans we have expected Snoke to be this big menacing force, but instead he is just this old guy who has been pulling the strings, Kylo is the real villain of the story, and this in many ways is different. Rey's parents were revealed to be nobodies once again hearkening to the 'anti cliched' tone that Rian Johnson is heading to. While these choices are surely going to put off certain fans, they weren't unreasonable and in fact do propell the characters forward. Kylo Ren's character has become so much more interesting because while he does have this inner conflict also is now overtaking the big-bad Snoke and coming to his own. Poe Dameron's character also has a very interesting arc as he comes to understand the importance of good leadership and the choices a leader must make fully coming to his own. Rey's character stands to represent the beacon of hope in the galaxy, and throwing away of the common trope of the 'Skywalker bloodline'. Because, if anything the overarching message of the Last Jedi is that the force isn't a tool that a few can utilize but rather something that flows through all, something that everyone can use and that is what Luke comes to realize, why he ultimately does think that the Jedi order must end. It is time for the galaxy to step up and it would take the whole galaxy to come together in order to bring down the First Order. Kylo Ren in fact puts this in perspective very well when he said 'It is time for old things to past' truly symbolizing the end of a Star Wars that we as fans are familiar with and really putting away the nostalgia goggles and having a new generation come to their own.",7,3,10,16 December 2017
Silence," a lengthy and stunning journey into the power of religious belief
","I particularly enjoy this style of filmmaking, Silence was a long, beautiful journey that followed a very calming pace despite the actually disturbing content. As we follow these two priests through their journey through Japan. I really liked how this film was so long, it really goes to show the excruciating length of their travels, yet it didn't feel dragged on a at all serving as a very well utilized narrative device.This is the second time we've seen Andrew Garfield in a film about religions and beliefs particularly Christianity. He does really well in these roles, his facial language and soft tone just creates such a soothing aura when very befitting of these roles. Liam Neeson and Adam Driver though didn't get a lot of screen time played it well when they were on screen as more minor characters.The real breakout performance in my opinion is definitely from Japanese actor: Shin'ya Tsukamoto as Mokichi. It was an extremely well acted role, the way he moves and talks in this film, the stumbling tone and the way he speaks and approaches the two pastors really shows this strength of his belief. I really liked how this came through in all of the Japanese villagers. Other than that also a shout out to the Japanese actor who played the bastardly Kichijiro, both very well acted roles.As mentioned the theme of belief is so powerful and so impactful in this film as it was in Garfield's other film, Hacksaw Ridge. From the smallest of tokens that the villagers held that had any connection to god to the secret baptisms that the village held. Tomokichi final song, it really is an ode to the power and strength of believing and religion.Overall Silence definitely has its very impactful and shocking moments however it does have its dull moments particularly in the later half of the film but none the less this is a great film.",7,0,0,22 February 2017
Logan," A sombre tone meets blood shedding violence, The next step for superhero films?
","Logan is the Wolverine movie that fans have always wanted, it packs in great emotional story telling and is littered with gritty, violent action sequences that only Wolverine can be worthy of, while at the same time handling the end and departure of beloved characters in such a great way. Humour was also very sparingly sprinkled in to Logan making it an overall amazing package.It was a true sendoff for a hero as we tie an end to Logan's legacy and leave behind Laura (X-23) to potentially carry on the mantle of Wolverine. Unlike the usual action-packed comic-book superhero movie this was comparatively subtle but contains doses of insane fight sequences that tops many that we've seen perhaps due to the well deserved R-rating. But surprisingly this movie manages to not only succeed on that front but also in telling this story that is really a lot more meaningful than the classic or even clichéd good versus evil that is slowly becoming overused and boring, so Logan really was just a fresh of fresh air among many other accolades that is achieves.The chemistry that develops between our trio of characters is great, the way Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman portray these old and worn- out characters is great. Especially Hugh Jackman as Logan, when you see this character, his posture and in his eyes there really is just the word 'tired' that comes to mind and the way that Jackman manages to get that across in this film is truly heart wrenching, the hopelessness that is felt by these characters can really be seen on these characters' facial expression. This actress who portrays Laura should also be applauded for the way she portrays this character that would sure to be compared to the brilliant portrayal of 'Eleven' from stranger things by Millie Bobby Brown. Another class act from a child-actress. The tone that is established through the actors and atmosphere is truly breathtaking and sombre. As a comic book fan it really is a blessing to see the 'Old man Logan' title be explored and reimagined to the big-screen in such a way. This movie shows the other superhero movies what a superhero movie could be and adds another to the list of R- rated films that are necessary of that rating and delivers beautifully under the category. In my opinion perhaps this is the next direction for superhero movies as people are starting to grow tired of the colourful capes and Leotards, just look at the change that has been done in the comic book world, darker tales and growingly gritty violence, perhaps the next step for superhero movies to evolve and adapt is by going in this direction, targeting a more mature audience.",9,4,12,28 February 2017
Beauty and the Beast," A genuine rendition of a Disney classic
","This is quite a brilliant adaptation of the original beauty and the beast, it does not try and be something that it isn't or try to be anything more than just what it is. It was a solid, genuine and enjoyable film. As the theme song dubs, it is 'A tale as old as time' so really what is there to change or add to? It's a classic. But what elevates this over the original animated version in my opinion is its stylistic choices and its musical pieces.The visuals in this film was breathtaking, from the set design to costume to the music really just paints a very Gothic and glamorous 'oil painting' of a scene and I loved this element of the film. The household objects voiced by the likes of 'Ian McKellen' were very good. However the most notable performance likely came from Luke Evans as Gaston, very much like his character in the original animated film he really just stole every scene that he was in. One element that must be done right is the relationship between the beast and Belle. Emma Watson is of course very resembling of Belle so that is a plus on that part. I think that Emma Watson does a decent job at selling the relationship between Belle and the beast and there is genuine sympathy towards the beast, however I feel that her acting does trip up a little particularly towards the end and this does take a little bit off of the film as a whole. But otherwise it is a great adaptation of the original, I enjoyed the music and it is a great time so long as you can accept that this film does live in the shadows of its predecessor and you shouldn't come in accepting more than it promises because, it really is just a beautiful and solid rendition of a classic tale.",6,2,7,28 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Well, did it live up to the first one?
","Guardians of the Galaxy 2 in my opinion does not surpass the original film however is not a let down at all. The second film managed to tie in a more interesting aspect about family and therefore becomes a much more self centered and confined film which may be a put off to some as in nothing really happens and everything is generally self contained with not much implications on the greater MCU. However as James Gunn has quoted he does want the Guardians to be mostly its own separate thing despite having to eventually join the Avengers in the Infinity War. Which is a creative choice that I fully support, granted what makes MCU great is its ability to tie in all these different characters a separate faction is a breath of fresh air and is a chance for audiences to just have fun without having to worry too much about the overall continuity.The film is very funny and contains many of the space battle sequences that we would like with a dose of Baby-Grootness that just edges on the line of being too much, a good thing that they have finally decided to bring back the old Groot as suggested in one of the five post credit scenes. My favourite character to come out of this second outing is Yondu and he actually plays a very interesting father-son dynamic between him and Quill also establishing a sort of rivalry with Kurt Russell's 'Ego' the planet. Gamora and Nebula's relationship was also very interestingly explored, as i said this film features heavily on family and this sort of familial ties. Another relationship that I really liked was between Drax and newcomer Mantis, they make a very good dynamic duo and Drax himself does become a much more interesting character compared to his last outing adding many comedic moments. One of my favourite moments was definitely Stan Lee's cameo, this is probably the best Stan Lee cameo so far, he is first seen speaking to a group of 'Watchers' an extraterrestrial race from the Marvel comics and then in the end credits seen trying to stop the Watchers from leaving telling them that 'there's more stories to tell.' What is so great about this particular cameo is that it confirms that Stan Lee is in fact playing the same Stan Lee in all of the Marvel films including his earlier non-MCU ones. Although this may not prove the Stan Lee is a watcher, it does seem like it has some ties to the Watcher and is interesting because he always pops up in major MCU events as Watchers do, as a sort of bystander. So just a fun Easter egg that Marvel throws in there. So the film was really great and I enjoyed the comedic aspects as well as the further character development that a largely self contained film like this managed to do despite having slight flaws like having the Sovereign popping up randomly felt like kind of a distraction but well i suppose they were just there to set up for Adam Warlock in the upcoming vol. 3.",7,2,5,28 April 2017
The Shape of Water," the sense of emptiness and the overwhelming sense of comfort
","The Shape of Water is Guillermo Del Toro's newest films, featuring amazing performances and stunning visuals. In comparison to many of Del Toro's other films there is a clear likeness in tone and visuals. However, in terms of depth in the narrative I would argue that The shape of Water exceeds many of Del Toro's other films by a long ways. At first glance, The Shape of Water is certainly a great romance but I thought that Del Toro certainly manages to weave in a very interesting theme of emptiness and the need to fill the void with some form of comfort or object of desire and affection. I really enjoyed the way this was portrayed throughout the film almost physically symbolized by the presences of the Amphibian man. What I mean is the way in which the film portrays this gang of 'misfits' or somewhat outcasts of society and closely examines their characters, their flaws and the way in which they are seemingly filled by the creature. The two most obvious examples being Sally Hawkins' Elisa who is mute and falls in love with the creature due to the fact that she felt that the creature can see through her largest flaw: her disability. Whereas, Richard Jenkins' Giles also an outcast, an out of fashion artist in his old age who is lonely finds some sort of rejuvenation in the creature. But, what is even more great is the fact that this theme is weaved into not only these characters but many others, Octavia Spencer's Zelda as an African American women facing racial prejudice and arguably most interestingly Michael Shannon's Richard Strickland and his relationship with the creature. I found that it was most fascinating to see that a character as such, living by the standards of the 'American life' with literal white picket fences, a loving wife and children having a very interesting rivalry with the creature. Somehow, their conflict stems from the fact that Richard some sort of superiority complex and the way in which the creature ties into his narrative as a sense of motivation almost fills his own lack of purpose in his suburban, stable lifestyle. All of this was done magnificently with brilliant acting across the board along with tje aforementioned stunning visuals and a musical score that went so perfectly with the beautiful story that was unfolding.",8,41,77,14 February 2018
The Disaster Artist," A comedy that manages to connect to audiences
","While The Disaster Artist was one of this year's most exceptional comedies, I can't help but feel that the over popularized: 'The Room' has now become a meme that won't go away, rather than the magic that once was upon first viewing. Indeed the Room has walked out of its once cult favourite status and is now a national phenomena following this excellent rendition of Tommy Wiseau's story by James Franco. But unfortunately it comes as a rather bittersweet sentiment as long time fans have loss that special gem of a horrible film that was once for themselves. The disaster artist itself was full of laughs ofcourse and the performances were all very good including both the Franco brothers yet it does fall flat in the final scene where the comedy of the original 'The Room' was in my opinion played up to an extent that really starts to make audiences cringe. However, the portrayal of Tommy and the comedy behind the real life character of Tommy and the mysteries behind him was all depicted quite brilliantly. This is definitely one of the smarter comedies to come out in recent years and still maintains a strong dramatic air that allows viewers to root for Tommy. In my opinion a successful comedy will manage to bring laughs but also moments of connection and relatability, and in an age of overplayed 'situational' comedies and over the top 'what if' scenarios. Perhaps an absurd yet true story is the best way to go. The disaster artist is certainly one to show despite of some flaws regarding the allocation of screen time to certain events and some issues with pacing as well as my personal issues with the final scene and the general over-hyped reception of the disaster artist.",7,0,1,22 January 2018
12 Strong," The problem with 'based on a true story' movies
","12 Strong stars Chris Hemsworth in a movie about a team of American Soldiers who attempt to take down the taliban. And i was....ok, a decent movie with great chemistry amongst the main cast, good individual performances and immersive war action. However, the narrative doesn't do anyone much favours, these bio-pics that are supposedly based on real events really do struggle with creating drama and intensity because the real events are often not that interesting. I am not doubting the significance and sacrifices of the real people behind this very real event but from an entertainment standpoint there really wasn't much source material to create a wholesome narrative.Like many films of the same tagline this movie has that one punchline that the rest of the narrative has to surround, in this case '12 men' vs the taliban. It is an interesting story but not enough to be a feature length film, and it was a long movie over 2 hours. I definitely felt that run time, a lot of filler and unnecessary parts that built little character and barely progressing the story. Unfortunately not a great movie, but maybe acceptable on first viewing.",6,1,2,8 June 2019
Kong: Skull Island," rather disappointing
","Kong: Skull Island has nothing beneath the surface that a genre film should have, other than the action and large scale scenes there was basically 0 character development and as a huge fan of the Peter Jackson rendition of King Kong I have to say I am disappointed in the outcomes of this film. Skull Island promised to up the ante and go 'big' with this new and scaled up Kong but the results really isn't that good at all. There was perhaps only 2 scenes in which we get big fights of Kong, which were really good yet as I said 2 only, most of the time the film just attempts to build suspense by not revealing where Kong is 'hiding' which really doesn't make much sense because he is a gigantic gorilla on this one tiny island. Although most the acting is uninspiring and the characters were generic and predictable, Samuel L Jackson was probably the saving grace of this film playing a relatively interesting and unique character unlike the rest, likes of Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston, a rather shame by the sound of these names. This film felt lacking both in character development and in fun, large scale monster battles and seems rather like a build up solely for the purpose of pitting Kong against Godzilla in the upcoming feature film. Not much attention was given to this film but for what it's worth this film was simply mediocre and just fine.",4,1,3,9 May 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," A story that is out of its time
","Murder on the Oriental Express was a charming film, it had amazing set pieces and colourful intriguing characters. As someone who has never seen the classic film, I found the ending to be rather predictable and this was an issue that I had. However, I see this not because this is somewhat of a cliched ending but rather, the modern day filmgoer is a lot more aware and has seen so much more twists that this is somehow expected. Hence, perhaps what should have been considered is whether this is a good idea to readapt this film that may be al little out of its time nowadays. However, in spite of this issue the modern day rendition had brilliant set pieces and magnificent camera work followed by brilliant acting that makes this certainly an enjoyable viewing experience. But indeed, storywise I did not find it so intriguing, especially towards the end of the film and that really shouldn't be the case in a crime/mystery drama.",6,0,0,16 December 2017
Arrival," A great film but viewers should be cautious
","Arrival will be noted as the film of the decade,, ending with a 'shocking twist' that is sure to leave many of the audience shocked. I thought that the film was great, with the exception of some loopholes that are ultimately inevitable in a film of this genre and theme. This film had a great emotional narrative running along the lines of the science fiction line. The acting were brilliant, from Amy Adams to Jeremy Renner all did a fantastic job complimenting each other. I thought that the deep humming music choice was great and set a intense and mysterious undertone. In the first half of the film our main character is attempting to decipher alien language and it was a very intriguing but ambitious attempt from a movie to try and capture this, as well as very ambitious for the characters in the movie. It was a great insight into language and linguistics, however after one point of the film the gears shifts and now the film enters a position where they deal with time, and specifically how time is nonlinear. This is of course the climax of the film however it is also when the steady pacing of the film becomes quite wonky until eventually imploding into one giant release of sorts.Upon understanding that the aliens language and thought of time is nonlinear Amy Adams' character starts to be able to see into the future and we understand that the opening scene of the film depicting her and her daughter were actually from the future. Now this is off putting in some ways, because if you really look into this idea you would find yourself asking the question 'why doesn't she just immediately understand everything?' and of course the means in which her character stops the other countries to call off their attacks on the 'pods' is extremely sketchy and odd. This film's slower paced first half definitely was an intriguing story while the second half does bring up some questions and plot holes. A friend of mine found this immensely off putting and decided that this completely ruins the film. However as a film I believe that the execution of such complex and theoretical ideas is a good one, the attempt to do so in a narrative fashion is a commendable one, as I have told this friend, 'how else do you expect them to depict a story about nonlinear time within a medium that is one-wayed and linear. Perhaps we are just not ready to take in theories as such that are just not able to be fully grasped by the likes of human as of yet. One thing that I anticipate will be of significance is this influx of positive reviews, this is because this film does a thing that many films are guilty for, they do a big twist ending with a mass implosion and resolution which masks the idea that this is a great film because of this 'wow factor'. In conclusion I would like to recommend this film but do be cautious in terms of falling into this trap and really think about the film as a whole rather than its surprise ending especially when viewing this particular film.",8,2,7,11 February 2017
Parasite," A story about social class, filled with twists and turns
","Bong Joon Ho is an absolute genius and has struck once again with the masterfully twisted Parasite. All four of the central performances are wonderful in depicting this fantasy like film that depicts a family slowly gaining the trust of and infiltrating another, upper class family. Parasite was amazing in the way that it was able to present twists and turns and shift genre and tone seamlessly. This film goes from pleasant comedy to a much darker film.Parasite at its core is about economic class, family and the parasitical relationship between different members of society, and it does a hell of a job doing it. This film is one of the best movies coming out of 2019 and is sure to surprise audiences with a twist that is both horrifying and surprising.",9,0,1,23 December 2019
Wonder Woman," Finally, after the atrocities of this cinematic universe's earlier entries we have a great film
","I was very pleases with the outcome of Wonder Woman and it is a real relief for comic book movie fans after the mess of BvS and Suicide Squad. I like pretty much every part of this film, from the amazing DC logo at the beginning of the film teasing the future of DC and Warner Bros.' cinematic universe to the acting to the script. An empowering film that represents women in film like none other before. Just think about the female lead superhero films that were predecessor of this film. (hmmm, Catwoman and Supergirl). On the point of having a whole new representation of women in film I have to say it was handled quite brilliantly and seamlessly. Patty Jenkins did not push the thing so much that it becomes on the ball and as many of you who have met the 'extreme feminists' may know, they do not represent women in their best light.Anyways, I thought that Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were both really good, and I very much liked the fish out of water situation depicted in both Themyscira and London. I thought that the film remained faithful to the source material in terms of this and also in terms of the costume. Gal Gadot is just so well casted in my opinion, despite the earlier criticisms. She nails it as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince, she sold the naivety act and still was able to sell bad ass combat sequences. Resulting in a very likable and strong female lead character. Another highlight I would like to mention is the opening scene on Themyscira, which once again focuses on the empowerment of women, but the whole battle sequence between the Amazons and the Germans was just so cool and exciting and Themyscira had such a great immersive and mystic aura I really enjoyed.Now about David Thewlis as Ares, I can see that they are going for the older NEw 52 Ares yet I personally would've liked to see the old blue armour wearing, more menacing version of the character. Although Thewlis is great and I can see the reasonings behind his casting I would've loved to see that younger and more threatening Ares, because at the end of the day Thewlis just seems like a rather nice guy.",7,3,18,8 June 2017
Marriage Story," The key is in the subtlety of the acting and direction
","Heart shatteringly subtle movie about a couple going through a divorce that does not rely on over the top acting in theratrics; but the genuine reflection of two people going through a period of separation. I was wonderfully surprised by how much I enjoyed Marriage story and how much it affected me emotionally. I was particularly invested in those scenes of almost mundane frustrations that don't rely on actors crying and screaming but the subtle hints of frustration.Adam Driver has quickly risen the ranks as one of my favourite actors and this is the role that he was born to play, there is a sequence of scenes in this film involving him having to deal with a series of events that Adam Driver plays brilliantly, so accurately reflecting that frustration of just wanting to get something over with. I was mesmerised and absolutely burrowed into that emotion that was not over the top, but real.I loved how this film portrays both sides of the argument and never paints one person as a bad person, as the audience we get to unravel how exactly they fell apart in their marriage but never once does it point fingers at one character nor paints them as bitter or hating each other. There is always a sense of hope in the details of the interactions between Charlie and Nicole that almost develops into a 'will they/won't they' situation; which was fascinating but I am glad that wasn't the direction they were taking, because realistically this isn't something that would happen. But it is the fact that despite them having a failed marriage these are still two people who care about each other and most importantly their child, and going through this strenuous and almost paradoxical circumstance of lawyering up and family court does not change that. It is these subtle moments that makes me absolutely adore Marriage Story.",9,6,8,23 December 2019
Black Panther," A well balanced entry to the MCU
","In my opinion, Black Panther tells one of the more interesting stories on the MCU, featuring a cast of brilliant actors who bring Wakanda to life. Notice, how i coined Wakanda rather than Black Panther specifically, this is due to the fact that Wakanda was o much of a character in the film and so many of its culture, natural beauty and citizens were fleshed out and made a large part of this film. In fact a lot of time and dedication were gone into the other aspects of the film. I thought that the film had one of MCU's more interesting villains as well, in the form of Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger, quite a lot is gone into his back story and as a street level villain I think he worked quite well. Much like the use of Vulture in Spider-man Homecoming. But, while in that case, the villain is menacing within a smaller 'street level' situation I thought in this case it's not necessarily Killmonger himself but what he represents that makes him the compelling villain that he is. Granted, he had a significant motive that can be empathized with he had a significant tie as to what he represented, the flaws in the former king T'Chaka and the conflicts that is bound to burden our hero T'Challa, the struggles he must make to choose between the right path and the path that would best benefit his people. I also enjoyed the many characters from Wakanda, Danai Gurira's Okoye was a strong female character that was a badass. Letitia Wright's Shuri who was a fun and interesting character as well. There was a decent amount of comedy that does not come into the expense of drama that the previous Thor Ragnarok may sometimes be criticized for and on a whole was a thrilling ride.All of which set in a setting that is stunning to look it, te blend of modern skyscrapers and vast mountains/valleys. And, the Wakandan culture, the rituals, the tribes, the vibrant colours all of which were presented in such a way that engages audiences and makes them grow more curious as to the many other facets of the fictional culture.",8,5,31,14 February 2018
Mother!," Thought evoking and deeply unsettling
","'Mother!' is the allegorical film that is very intriguing and fascinating, it is clear that views on it is very controversial and some claim it is a pretentious work while others view at as a very powerful art-house film. No matter which side you are on it cannot be denied that 'Mother!' is a film that makes you think, the fact that there are so many interpretations of the film alone is a brilliant example of this. Because of this I think that 'Mother!' is indeed a masterpiece. The whole film complete with brilliant acting and an intriguing tone just really drew me in. The use of sound adds so much suspense and intrigue to the mysterious tone of the film that I enjoyed.There are many interpretations of 'Mother!', the allusions to modern day pop culture and celebrity fandom, biblical allusions to the Genesis, to the Exodus. All of which are very valid interpretations of the film perhaps because they are all correct and all play a part in the story. To me I strongly felt that this must be an allusion to Genesis, with the characters that liken Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel being very clear in the movie. But I am sure that you have read these discussions elsewhere so I will not go into it.What I really like about this film is contrary to usual biblical interpretations we take the point of view of a very interesting character, one who represents mother Earth, played by Jennifer Lawrence. The film's decision to put 'god' in marriage to 'Earth' is such a brilliant and interesting idea. And brings a whole new perspective, 'Mother!' presents the Earth's point of view. It shows us our selfishness as human beings trespassing Earth and destroying all the this figure has built. In some ways it's a cautionary tale and that one particular scene towards the end of the film when a group of people punch and trample mother is such a powerful imagery that represents our own disregard and trampling of Earth as human beings. So what is so great in my opinion is that the film takes a biblical story but adds a sense of nuance to the film by having this new perspective that is so much more important and relevant in today's modern society. It's a modern retelling of a classic biblical tale. At the end of the film we also realize that there is a loop and that following the events leading to an explosion the film reverts to the beginning with a different woman than the 'mother ' character. Along with the peculiar exclamation mark at the end of the title this film is screaming at its audience to learn from these stories, to learn from past mistakes and to understand the importance of maintaining a balance in this world that we live in. A great message that I picked up when watching Mother! And to me, I don't think Mother! Is trying to be pretentious at all.",9,1,7,5 October 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," I have waited, and now I've watched it
","This movie is...controversial. In my opinion it isn't great although has its redeeming factors, it is in fact quite mediocre. Which is personally a big let down because I have been so hyped up for this for so long. My biggest problem with this is its story, to be more precise there is too much story. Now what can I possibly mean by this? Isn't lots of story/plot development good? Well yes, but in the case of Batman V Superman we didn't get any dept instead we get literally a lot of stories.I reckon there are about 6 or 7 different plot lines going on. Batman's revenge/hate towards superman, Lois Lane journalist stuff, the general public deciding whether they should accept superman, superman dealing with the post 'man of steel' problems, 'The dawn of justice', Superman and Lois' love story and Lex Luthor tinkering with '________' and alien stuff(+doomsday). There is too much content. Now I would've settled with like a maximum of 3, the DCCU has bit off far too much than they could chew. It would've been good enough to have this actually being batman v superman, without all the other mumbo jumbo. But because they tried to fit so much in nothing worked, not even the 'main event'. Superman didn't really even have any motives to fight batman, I didn't really see any reason why they settled the feud. Both the motives to begin to fight and to stop fighting were sloppy and didn't make much sense at all.Now, as a fan of DC and comics in general I could understand what was happening because I've got the background knowledge and I basically know what is going to go down. But my friends who went to watch it with me who weren't comic book fans struggled and was quite confused at the end of it as far as I could tell. Watching Batman V Superman was like watching a Game of Thrones episode without watching any other episodes. Where we cut around and jump around to each character, how are we the viewers supposed to know what on Earth is happening when every other shot we move on to another plot line and character with no build up to anything.However like I said there are some redeeming factors, Batfleck was great, I like how they did this Batman. He kills, which puts of lots of fans but to me it's absolutely alright. Batman had cool fights scenes and looks great. Superman was decent, basically what we saw in Man of Steel. But the big break out was definitely Gal Gadot's Wonder woman, although most of the time she is Diana Prince when we finally get Wonder Woman it was amazing. From what I can see apparently she is more overpowered than Batman and Superman, single handedly holding off a certain someone that was hammering old Bats and Sups. Plus overall it had good visuals and action.The reason why I still gave it a 7/10 is because of how much I liked Wonder woman and Batman in this movie and the convoluted plot was more of a cringe to me instead of a complete put off. I understood that they wanted to establish this universe and give us the basis of the DCCU which is why they tried to fit in so much which I can get behind if it means that we would get a great DCCU. So overall although it wasn't great I shall have faith that at least it has paved the path to a great DCCU.",6,1,3,29 March 2016
The Greatest Showman," Brilliant moments but incoherent storytelling
","I truly feel that there was a missed opportunity here with the greatest showman, it had great talent, music, costume design and an overall aura that feels like an extravaganza yet somehow it still falls short.If you have seen the trailer you have likely already seen the film, there were brilliant songs and likeable characters for sure but at the end of the day the storytelling was horrendously lacking. Which is as I have said a terrible shame seeing as there was a brilliant story about acceptance and prejudice right there yet the film never seems to fully capitalize. Much like Barnum's circus was described by the characters in this film this film is definitely likeable but at the end of the day, a cheesy, popcorn shoving flick. This film can also be described as a series of single moments of brilliance, when the film really utilized the musical aspects it really presents these visually stunning scenes yet, outside of those moments this is a very spotty film with an incoherent narrative. Indeed, the film seems to jump from scene to scene, moment to moment without any worthwhile character development or motive and without establishing much story points. While the movie had characters that were physically fleshed out and unique they weren't given much time for characterization except for few individual characters, as a result many of the characters seem more like caricatures then characters with personality and heart, which is something that the film truly needs. It almost seems like because the characters were so individually stylized physically they didn't see a need to narratively build their characters.Then again, those moments and bursts of energy in the film were just so well done that makes the film something that cannot be simply dismissed, a true shame. The greatest showman thrives at depicting the human spirit and tenacity yet fails to deliver a story with a coherent story and focus. But in there somewhere is a great film that sadly was not what the end result was. If the greatest showman could better build to character revelations and the main romance story with meatier character motives that truly connects those individually great moments I believe we do have something great here.",5,75,144,20 December 2017
Life," Solid alien/horror film
","Life was a solid horror/alien movie with a wonderful cast and well shot visuals. It is not a masterpiece especially considering the genre's many great entries, including the alien which seemed to be something that this film has modelled after. I liked how this film in contrast to Alien seemed very plausible and realistic, focusing on the 'science' part of sci-fi. The mission in search of extra terrestrial living organisms is a very interesting topic and this film made the possibilities of this seem so much more plausible. At the same time Life also brings up an interesting idea of how little we know about the universe that we live in and how inexperienced we are. How alien life form could be so different to our expectations and hence the debate of whether we should explore and the consequences of human curiosity. It carried a good amount of intensity and suspense and was gory and terrifying at times.The performances were quite good, the cast is pretty great though so there was no surprise there but it did fall flat in writing though, not that it was poor but it's a very straight forwards and rather clichéd trope that we've seen many times even though it was indeed well done.",6,84,125,2 July 2017
Deadpool," they did it right this time
","Yes indeed Ryan Reynolds' second take on deadpool beats crazy, lazer eyed, bamfing mute deadpool that we got in X-men origins: Wolverine. Deadpool was done right thanks to the love and passion that the people making this film had for this property and character. It was like seeing Deadpool walk right out of a comic book page, watching Reynolds I just feel like seeing Deadpool. I really feel impressed that the third wall breaking was done great too, it wasn't sort of cringe but actually made sense and those jokes do land well. I think that the eyes part on the mask being able to squint really helps build Deadpool's character and makes him seem so much more charismatic, with those we're no longer just staring at a mask without really delving into Deadpool's emotions. Because after all Deadpool is known for his outgoingness and without that would seem quite inwards and toned down, unlike 'the Deadpool way'.Now despite all the praise I am giving it Deadpool has its flaws, but I don't believe they surpass the positives by far. I didn't really like the order of events being not in chronological order because I feel that it is unnecessary. Some of my friends told me this too but really? That is just cherry picking. Some people told me that they felt that Deadpool didn't live up to the hype, if you are one of those people I've gotta say that you shouldn't be penalizing Deadpool because it isn't as good as what someone else told you because whether something is good is completely opinion based and just because it isn't as good as you thought it's still pretty good.I am very interested now in how Deadpool is going to further tie in to the X-men universe, the appearances from Colossus and Negasonic teenage warhead. It would be great to see appearances from X-men of the main roster and to see Deadpool in the main X-men movies too. If we see Deadpool appear in the announced last Hugh Jackman/Wolverine movie that would be great.ds' second take on",8,2,9,9 April 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," The simple formula for a good action movie
","John Wick 2 in my opinion elevated pass John Wick, the world building in this film was so great and just so cool and exciting. I found it extremely interesting to delve back in this world of assassins and to see all of these inner working of this world that was sprinkled around the first film. It really is just a big, loud, fun action spectacle. In an age like this it's really somehow hard to find movie like this but if you think about it it's not that hard, take away the meaningless attempts of creating some mind blowing story and just make it a good time, after all nobody goes into an action movie wanting a two hour in depth exploration of the human mind does it, Kingsman did it and now John Wick has done it for the second time. A simple story, triggered by clear emotionally triggered motives and a good 1 to 2 hours of headshots, hand to hand combat and one-liners. What more could you need!",7,0,1,26 February 2017
Annihilation," A missed opportunity with a brilliant first half
","Admittedly I had high hopes before watching Annihilation on Netflix no less as the producers have suddenly decided not to release the film in cinemas in my country. Sadly, I did not find this to be an amazing film, it was good but I just expected so much more especially after being hyped up as being 'Too smart for most audiences'. Now this might sound like the film is in fact too smart but I just don't see that as the case. High concept films like this have a tendency of ambiguity and suspension of disbelief, in most cases I see myself as one who tends to be more lenient and overlooking of such absurdities as in the case of Interstellar's final act which remains one of my favourite sci-fi films. Yet Annihilation just doesn't do it for me. I've heard and deciphered that the overarching theme of the film is this self destructive tendency of humanity and the symbolic nature of cancer cells in their ability to corrupt but also their existence as a natural biological error. Certainly an interesting concept to be paralleled with the symbol of the shimmer, the careful foreshadowing of the refracting effects of the shimmer and other slight symbols that the film drops along the way. However, by the end I can't help but think, so is that it? Now, obviously that final confrontation between Natalie Portman's Lena and the alien humanoid thing was absolutely insane and intense, there just doesn't seem to be that much of a purpose or message behind it. And unfortunately even the 'twist' that the film leaves us with of whether or not the Lena we see remains the same Lena as the one we were introduced to does not save the film. However, this aside and the somewhat awkward dialog aside Annihilation was a very beautiful film visually. The characters were interesting enough and I very much enjoyed the slow burn first half of the film. But, as we approach the second half of the film when the pace quickens I just felt that all of that slow intensity just went away and we are left with irrational characters doing cliched horror movie character things. To me this was a missed opportunity but because of its amazing first half I believe annihilation deserves its praise. And, whether you agree or not with my interpretation of the films ending at the very least Annihilation is one that is bound to spark conversations.",7,3,7,17 March 2018
Incredibles 2," A sequel that was actually wanted
","Incredibles 2 is the sequel to the hit Pixar animation, The Incredibles. Long in the wood works, this film had a lot of hype to live up to and in many cases it meets these expectations. Incredibles 2 picks up right after the end of the film and explores new dynamics in the Superhero trope as well as familial and gender roles. Much like its predecessor, this movie challenges the stereotypes of the Superhero genre and in addition tackles new topics such as the aforementioned 'gender roles'.The Incredibles 2 has clearly been incubated with much love and is a case where I would think a sequel is absolutely needed, unlike many of today's sequels that are set to make a quick buck The Incredibles 2 had a story to tell and a purpose. Personally, this holds up as one of the best Pixar sequels on par with Toy Story's brilliant additions. See, unlike films such as Monsters University or even the highly successful Finding Dory, while there was anticipation, it could be seen the the writers didn't necessarily have any material for the continuation of the stories of our beloved characters. In which case, I would think that having sequels is unnecessary. Incredibles 2 handles its characters impeccable, with fun character moments that highlight the growth and development of each of the characters. All this was enhanced by the use of new technology to craft very fine and intricate images. This was a sequel that had something to add to the foundation created in the first film, a wonderful, heartwarming sequel and a brilliant family film.",8,1,2,28 June 2018
Her," A beautifully melancholy film subtly discussing themes on the human experience
","I recently watched Her and felt that I have gained a new appreciation for the movie as well as Spike Jonze's unique style of filmmaking. The first time watching the movie I found it bleak and unsatisfying, like a Black Mirror episode without the intensity or heavy blows. However, after recently re-watching this movie I found it to be such a breath of fresh air compared to everything else, much like Spike Jonze's own 'Lost in Translation'. Both movies were 'intensely personal' and 'horrifyingly realistic' yet all bundled up into a melancholy and calm movie that quite literally warms you up inside.Unlike the heavy dramas that are designed to hit certain marks of intense dramatic performances, where actors and actresses tries to bawl their eyes out in an attempt to present the intensity of the scene, Jonze's films are like a gentle sob. A desperate cry that can faintly be heard or seen. But that is where the power of Jonze's cinema come in, to be able to say so much in so little is a badge of honour to not only Jonze and his vision but to the acting involved. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a gut punching performance in this movie where most of the time he is projecting his emotion to a glorified smartphone. While Scarlett Johansson thrives on projecting her emotions through voice acting alone.Her is a deep marination on love and what love means, whether it truly transcends physicalities, or whether it is more carnal and primitive. It also discusses technology and the way technology is transforming romantic relationships now a days, perhaps briefly drawing to themes of losing our sense of humanity in a slowly dehumanized world with increased reliance on technology. Of Course also dealing heavily with loneliness and isolation as primary themes.Her manages to do all this while invoking audience's' emotions and self reflection as we are bound to feel like Joaquin Phoenix's Theodore at one point or another in our lives, lonely and isolated.",9,0,0,8 June 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," The power of belief
","Hacksaw Ridge is an amazing movie, one of the best films of the year. First of its depiction of war and its horrors was masterfully done, the war scenes were horrifically gory, the use of visual effects and makeup were to a degree of brilliance in these scenes. As we follow the protagonist through and through the battlefield the horrors we see just so brilliantly reflects the horrors of war, from the rats and maggots eating away the deteriorating bodies to the bodies with their internal organs out, it was like a scene from a horror movie, which makes it all the more powerful as we as audiences understand that this is in fact the 'truth of war'. It was very impactful, most importantly the atmosphere that the film sets up for the war scenes are truly indulging, through the use of smoke and special effects I really found myself sort of 'lost' in the horrors of this battle. Everything were presented in a very realist way, I remember quite vividly the scenes in which the men would just lift their heads and immediately get gunned down to their deaths or how many of the men dies almost instantaneously, this idea of how easily a life could be taken did leave a large impact on me.Moving on to the actors, Andrew Garfield I believe gives one of the best performances from him ever, the way he portrays the character of Desmond Doss makes him such an inspirational figure, Throughout the film he never loses that sheepish grin,in contrast to his fellow comrades it is as if the war has not really left a toll on him. The way he still 'lives on' with that undefeated spirit of him was captured amazingly in Andrew Garfield's performance. It was a brilliant choice of casting Garfield, from his physique alone it would seem that he is perhaps lesser or weaker, which really helps emphasise on the character of Desmond, of how despite being weak his heart and grit may be stronger than any other. His spirit and firm belief in god is really fleshed out against his shortages in physical strength.Hugo Weaving also delivers a masterful performance, as an audience I could just see the internal conflict that is constantly seen on Weaving's face. The internal struggle was done so subtly, this is yet another brilliant entry from Weaving. Another brilliant performance which surprised me was from Vince Vaughn, it has been sometime since he has starred in a serious film and stepped away from comedy. In this film he was at times the comedic relief providing brilliant comedy one liners, but never dismiss his ability to act out those more emotional and serious scenes because in this movie Vince Vaughn really hits the ball out of the park on that side also. Overall the moral of this film was a great one and way portrayed very well. The power of believing, this man, Desmond truly and wholeheartedly believes in his god and the thing about this movie is how belief can be so empowering. Even when others did not approve of or agree with the way he depicts the bible and god, he stuck with it and that firm belief guided him and allowed him to save all of those people at Hacksaw Ridge. This film isn't necessarily a film about Christianity or god but more of the idea of 'believing in something', towards the end of the film there was a scene in which the men refused to storm Hacksaw Ridge without Desmond, the men did not possess the same level of belief as Desmond towards god, but they believed in one thing: 'Desmond Doss' and in turn their belief in him brought victory at Hacksaw Ridge. So the most important thing that I personally got out of Hacksaw Ridge was the idea of how important believing is, hey, believing alone can't accomplish anything indeed but if you apply belief to action then you could really cause a large impact.",9,5,11,26 November 2016
Warcraft," too ambitious
","Warcraft was way too ambitious and although I could see it as enjoyable for the gaming community who plays warcraft it is really just a confusing mess for other casual movie goers. It is overly complicated trying to fit in too much characters and ideas from this rich source material and really just ended up being a mess. Some parts didn't make sense and nothing really is explained, lots of things are sort of just thrown in there and are sort of just to be taken as it is. Although it is a visually pleasing film, in terms of substance it does not have much. So overall Warcraft I would say was alright, it wasn't the first video game movie that finally got it right as some of us have anticipated but it isn't one of the worst things to ever come out of that genre either as it does have quite a poor track record.",5,2,4,4 September 2016
Sully," the miracle on the Hudson
","Sully is an emotional film with amazing performances. Tom Hanks as always was brilliant, this man could not fail to embody a role. I thought that it was very interesting that instead of reciting the events of the water landing we also got to see the aftermaths and outcomes of the event. This is one of Clint Eastwood's shortest films and I think this sort of length is much better as the long run times sometimes really makes the film drag for quite a bit, so that is one good thing that came out of the film.One of my favourite parts of the movie was that we were not given one side to root for throughout the film, we got both sides of the argument and at times either sides to the argument seemed very plausible and made a lot of sense. This really got audiences thinking, 'was it captain Sully making everyone at risk by performing a water landing? Could he really have made it back to the airport under the conditions?' It was very interesting to get to see and analyze for yourself instead of the film shoving it in your face.This film really captures the best qualities of people, how when facing a common threat people would band together and collaborate and support each other. All 155 passengers and crew were saved and have survived the landing, not only due to captain Sully's landing and experiences but is really this joint effort of policeman, fireman and all the people who came together in the light of need. This could be a very powerful message and imagery that is very empowering and a very important part of the real life event that the film captures impeccably.",8,0,2,18 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," Better than Prometheus, not as great as the original films
","Better than Prometheus, not as great as the original films. Alien Covenant was pretty good, there were intense sequences and solid scares but gave us no further development on the origins of humans. The humans in this film continued to make stupid decisions and the Xenomorphs obliterated them, just as any other Alien movie. The saving grace of this whole thing though, was Michael Fassbender as the droids David and Walter, his performance was amazing and David's arc of trying to create the perfect lifeform was very interesting. The back and forths and interactions between the two were very well acted and interesting to see unfold. Katherine Waterston as the 'new' Ripley was pretty good also, she was a similar role but does manage to distinguish herself from Ripley's character. I didn't really like the way the aliens looked in this film though, there was a shot that I remember which was also in the trailer where a Xenomorph was jumping onto a glass window and I just thought how much better practical effects are.Overall it was a decent watch, it had enough action and unfolding of the mystery surrounding David's character but isn't really the groundbreaking film that the original movie was.",6,2,6,2 July 2017
