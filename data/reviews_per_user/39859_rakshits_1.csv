Airlift," Akshay Kumar is simply amazing He's the Best
","What a delightful blessing to the Indian Cinema by Akshay Kumar, Raja Menon and the entire group of Airlift. The tale of greatest human departure told amazingly well. Its so great from the begin to end that you can feel what condition those 1,70,000 Indians would have experienced. Applaud, applaud and applaud at last that is the thing that me and the entire theater was doing. Akshay Kumar as Ranjit Katiyal was simply amazing he has taken his acting to another level with this one. Salute to him for doing stunning and moving films like Airlift. Nimrat Kaur as his better half was just too great, her scene with Prakash Belawadi is amazing and applaud commendable. Purab Kohli, Kumud Mishra and particularly Prakash Belawadi were too great. Course by Raja Menon is spectacular he has done an incredible work in looking into this genuine story. Feeling so pleased to be an Indian and acknowledged what awesome thing my nation India has accomplished for every one of us. Salute to every one of those unsung saints of this greatest human departure ever. What's more, Thank You to the entire group of Airlift for this notable motion picture. One of India's best ever.",9,1,2,23 August 2016
