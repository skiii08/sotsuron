Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," anyone else noticed?
","the opening sequence of new hope: Imperial stormtroopers board the rebel ship and fight the rebel soldiers. Many troopers are killed, even more rebels. You see everywhere the corpses of dead soldiers and troopers. Darth Vader enters the ship and is not very nice...now watch phantom menace. Isnt it remarkable? No human is ever killed by the soldier-droids! In the whole movie there is a lot of fighting and laser shooting and all you see is destroyed robot junk but never a human killed or even some corpses on the ground....In Fact Episode 1 is a harmless Disney movie, and that is a pity...",Null,0,1,29 June 2001
Amélie," European cinema at its best
","I must confess that I rate movies I like pretty high, so for movies I love I miss the 11 for ranking. 'Die fabelhafte Welt der Amelie' (as a F/BRD co-production it was directed in Paris but i think co-financed from Germany and after long waiting finally was dubbed in german) surprised me in many ways! First the movie was nearly sold out and so my place was terrible and in front at the edge. Nevertheless i was for 2 hours entertained like seldom before,a suicidal gold fish, garden dwarves on a voyage round the world and the imaging of a romantic and fabulous world...Jean-Pierre Jeunet - you know, this wired European who commited Alien 4 (in which at the end North-america is blown away) - is a wonderful creative director and I fell instantly with Audrey Tautou in love. I could just say 'Amelie' will be a 'classic movie' but imho this film is more! It has - well, call me crazy - a special magic that only few movies posses but for that i love cinema. The High-Score on imdb -currently 8.6 - didnt surprise me, 'Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' is one of the most successful french movies, but please hollywood, dont even think of a remake! In only two sentences: What a wonderfully, magical tale. Charming actors, wonderful location, rivetting script, fantastic cinematography. . .",10,1,3,6 September 2001
