The Avengers," Why So Serious?
","Marvel's The Avengers flat out brings the fun back into comic book films. Don't get me wrong, I love the Nolan-verse's darkness and depth and Iron Man's introspection, but those movies aren't fun in the basic sense of the word. The beauty of the Avengers, in contrast, is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and despite the large cast the characters, somehow gives them their due individual justice.In this league of heroes seeking justice (poor choice of words?), I want to highlight Captain America and Black Widow in particular. The latter fits surprisingly well in the 21st century and cracks quite a few good jokes as any 90 year old would. Black Widow, with her increased screen time compared to Iron Man 2, comes across with more agency of her own instead of pure sex appeal, though that is surely there too. I can also note that while I enjoyed Edward Norton as the Incredible Hulk, I prefer Mark Ruffalo's humor and think he deserves an film of his own.Loki, in his first appearance since his debut in Thor, provides a well-balanced and somewhat empathetic villain who I think he will be a mainstay in the MCU for as long as it continues. Finally, you can see some of the real-life issues of accountability that become the basis for future films in the series.The Avengers deserves 4 out of 4 shawarmas.",10,0,3,9 August 2016
The Incredible Hulk," G.I. D'oh
","Summary: G.I. D'oh *** This review may contain spoilers ***The Incredible Hulk (2008) is by no means a bad movie, but there are too many moments where I found myself unconvinced, or even confused, by what the characters were trying to accomplish. As the second entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film does something unique by not concentrating on the origins of the titular character, but that decision ultimately leaves too much confusion and fluff in the main plot.That's not to say I disagree with this decision, as the creation of a mad green monster is a well- played movie trope that I'm am a bit glad they avoided (a trope most likely originating from Frankenstein, in which the original cinematic production creations an excellent creature). The problem with the film lies in what is actually on the screen, which in my opinion are a lot of nonsensical decisions.The beginning search for a government project gone awry becomes too much of a concentration that comes off as a Jason Bourne movie instead of a concentration on who the character actually is. This problem may arise from the way I view Thunderbolt Ross, played by William Hurt, who seems too one-dimensional and obliviously ill-advised in his attempt to recreate green super soldiers who just seem so uncontrollable. In other words, by jumping immediately into action spy- thriller style, Ross seems unconvincing and that leaves little time to develop his character with any doubt to his own motives, something that worked so well in Iron Man.Similarly, mercenary soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) seems like none other than a blockhead, and it's hard to relate to a character who stands toe-to-toe with a megaton creature like the Hulk who merely shakes his head with 'Is that all you got?' Ross' lack of reigning in Blonsky just seems like another example of bad life choices in this movie. Finally, as far as negatives, While I like Liv Tyler, I found her romance as Betty Ross with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) rather flat, again amplified by Thunderbolt Ross' lack of empathy for her situation when it seems very clear rather early that Banner is not a bad guy.It is worth noting that I enjoyed some things about this movie. I felt that Norton does a decent job as Banner/The Hulk, providing some seriousness to the role, albeit maybe too serious at times. Second, the cinematography was very well-done, especially the scenes in Brazil. Finally, while the film lacks emotional chemistry, an exception to this is ironically with the CGI; some of the most emotive scenes occur when Banner's alter ego comes out and I would liken this to Andy Serkis' work, notable in Lord of the Rings.All in all, this film provides a credible Hulk but I feel like I still needed more convincing given the excellent cast, so I give it 2 out of 4 smashes.",5,0,0,7 August 2016
Iron Man 3," Hollow Like a Fortune Cookie
","Iron Man 3 struggles to consistently excite in the way that The Avengers did. There are several impressive scenes, including on Air Force One, but as a whole the plot feel jumbled. Robert Downey, Jr., Don Cheadle, and Gwyneth Paltrow all return, along with Jon Favreau. Ben Kingsley also jumps on the scene as Iron Man's nemesis, the Mandarin.One problem I have with the plot is it feels too much like Iron Man 2, with a jealous scientist trying to sabotage Iron Man for the control of the arms trade. Similarly, Iron Man's identity crisis and PTSD seems redundant and a bit unconvincing. Another major complaint I have is how the film treats the Mandarin, which I feels betrays the source material and misses an opportunity to create a truly magnificent villain. Rebecca Hall's character comes across as unnecessary, and despite being a fine actress, she does not add much to the plot.Overall, Iron Man 3 tries to make some political statements regarding the war on terror and political accountability, and also does so with Tony and Pepper's relationship, but does so ineffectively and haphazardly due to the other flaws in the film and only gets 2 out of 4 stars.",4,4,5,10 August 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Renewed Hope
","I wanted to wait a bit to review Rogue One: A Star Wars Story so as not to spoil anything (this review is largely spoiler free). There are so many thinks I loved about this movie, and as much as I liked The Force Awakens, that film played it safe. This one did not. Rogue One essentially corrects many of the complaints people have about the prequel trilogy, from the sappy dialogue, bogged down politics, tame action, moody Anakin, and Jar Jar Binks. While this film fits within the Star Wars canon chronology (think of Rogue One as Episode 3.5), a Star Wars initiate can easily view this as their first film and understand what is going on. As I mentioned earlier, Force Awakens fits the traditional Star Wars formula, so much so that it is essentially a reboot of A New Hope. Rogue One is a whole different animal. The female lead, compared to Force Awakens, seems to be less of a Mary Sue with a bit more depth. As good as Kylo Res may end up being in the sequel trilogy, Darth Vader is, well, Darth Vader. While the Force is strong with this film, it relies more on it's brute depiction of intergalactic war (it is called Star WARS after all). For those of you who appreciate the original film, Rogue One does an excellent job of referring to that film with subtle references and throwbacks that Star Wars nuts will love. A few other highlights include the droid K-2SO who along with The Force Awakens's BB-8 will sure to become a fan favorite. The film makes effective use of Darth Vader in true terrifying form, and sure made me want to pop in A New Hope when it ended. Rogue One sure exceeded my expectations and is the best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back.",10,2,9,16 December 2016
Iron Man 2," A Caged Bird
","Iron Man 2 is definitely a superior film, and unlike most sequels, is not a huge let down from its predecessor. I would argue that Iron Man 2 has aged almost as well as the first Iron Man. It examines some real world questions of weapons accountability and the mental and physical toll playing a superhero can have on one person.Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johannson make solid appearances in the film, and Don Cheadle takes over as Rhodey, with a few surprises in store for the character. Jon Favreau, who directed the first two Iron Man flicks, has an increased role as Tony and Pepper's assistant and driver Happy Hogan, and along with Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson, provide some funny moments throughout the film.The film also develops Pepper Potts, but the true newcomer is Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko aka Whiplash. I quite enjoyed the idea of this character and his main entrance is quite cool, but like Vanko's caged bird, he becomes too much of a lab rat and I think this is a misuse of the character. In other words, one can say Whiplash enters with a bang but goes out with a whimper that is a bit too reliant on special effects.My only slight complain is this portion of that character and Iron Man 2 still handles the issue of Tony's legacy very well and gets 3.5 out of 4 stars.",8,1,2,8 August 2016
Zootopia," 'Life is more complicated...everyone makes mistakes,' including this film.
","Based on reading the reviews for this film on IMDb, there seems to be quite the love/hate relationship, so I can say off the back I enjoyed the movie, despite its numerous flaws. Is the film too PC? Maybe, but I argue it's too open-ended to really say this. For instance, Zootopia makes a point, with the main character Judy saying that police officers should unite and not divide society. On one hand, it's possible for a viewer on the left to say, 'This represents fair criticism of the divisions between society and our police force.' On the other hand, someone on the right could respond with, 'Judy reminds me of my local police officer who serves with dignity and dedication.' My point here is I think you can take what you want to hear out of the film's message to a degree, with both sides having some merit.Another example of the film's open-ended nature revolves around the depiction of the predators and prey. In Zootopia, we encounter the stereotypes of the savage and strong predators and the small and meek prey, both of which Judy and Nick show at certain points. The film doesn't make a clear distinction that one side or another is truly at fault in the plot. Instead, the movie more or less depicts individuals within each group as protagonists or antagonists. This may seem a bit too PC in not wanting to offend any one group, but Zootopia does just enough to poke some fun at these stereotypes and character defects, and I argue that comedy is inherently anti-PC since it subverts one's own beliefs.While I feel the charges of PC are a bit overblown, I do have two criticisms of my own, along with one major complement. My first criticism is that the end of the film is rushed and seems to tie plot points together too conveniently. So as not to spoil anything, I can say that the film reaches this disappointing climax about 75 minutes in. My second, and arguably the more problematic criticism involves the use of animals. I have no issue with the violence (PG is an accurate rating despite arguments otherwise), but suggesting, as the film does, that foxes and rabbits are ultimately the same, just as different human ethnicities are, is problematic and silly.Finally, I love the animation and expect Zootopia to win in that category at the Oscars in '17. I recommend Zootopia with 3 out of 4 stars as though-provoking, if imperfect, at the very least.",7,2,5,2 August 2016
My Neighbor Totoro," I like Totoro, but...
","I can't say enough of the animation, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Despite this, I'm not sure what message the film sends, besides being a child-like distraction. Maybe that's the point, and I guess that's OK for kids, but nothing really stands out in a cohesive way for adults. Another possible message involves the tension between childish innocence (as represented by Totoro?) and the worries of growing into adulthood, though I'm not entirely sure what that message is other than being true prima facie.All in all, the film is too ambiguous in the conflict department, and as a result is lacking in immersion for the viewer. Even children's films deserve better than this. Though also a flawed and somewhat rambling film, I prefer Spirited Away.My Neighbor Totoro gets 2 out of 4 stars.",5,6,16,28 July 2016
Children of Heaven," The Goldfish Movie
","As much as I wanted to like Children of Heaven, it just didn't do it for me. I commend the child actors, as I can't blame them for a script that I felt lacked the urgency and grittiness of the living situation in which they found themselves.Some parts were unnecessary or just outright silly. Some of the relationship between Ali and his father working seemed unconvincing and underdeveloped, and therefore expendable. Also, I was slightly offended at a scene where Ali, at a critical point in the film, cries in order to get his way. At best, I was left scratching my head confused and unconvinced. At worst, I got the message that whining is an OK way to get things done. I know the main character is a kid, and maybe it's too much to ask for someone that age to have a coherent conversation explaining the situation and asking for help in a mature manner. However, Ali does act fairly mature around his sister, so I guess I expected more out of a likable character.Finally, the goldfish thing was a bit lost on me, but that might just be me and I'd appreciate any clarification. I would suggest A Separation instead for anyone wanting an introduction to Iranian cinema.2 out 4 stars.",4,3,15,28 July 2016
Suicide Squad," 'A whole lotta pretty in a whole lot of crazy.'
","The title of this review, like Harley Quinn, sums up Suicide Squad. Broken down in parts, Suicide Squad opens with a bang, meanders in the middle with the urgency of a root canal, and closes with another bang. The only problem with the closing bang is it comes in the form of one of Joker's gag guns. (Don't worry that's not a spoiler, just a metaphor.)The film gets quite a bit right in the backstory of the major characters, particularly Deadshot and Harley. These two characters, along with Diablo, are a strength of the movie throughout development-wise, played by Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jay Hernandez. A problem with the other characters, save for a few Boomerang jokes, is their utility; at times they aren't given much to do and they seem like mere tagalongs without their own agency.Much will be made of Jared Leto's Joker, and I believe he does an OK job. At times he reminds me too much of the mob bosses in the comics he works so hard to upend, but Leto is a great actor and I think he will have much to add in future installments. I think one problem with him is that he was marketed so heavily, when the concentration on the plot should be on the Squad.Speaking of the plot...another weakness. I can't say I cared much for Amanda Waller's (Viola Davis) rationale for having a bunch of crackpots lead a demolition squad, and the results are pretty predictable. The middle of the film is a bit awkward as far as team chemistry goes, even among Deadshot and Harley. Just when the film comes close to saying something profound, it reverts back to oddly-times jokes and head nods.In the end, this is probably DC's best attempt in the Extended Universe at something original and in general, even though it ends rather predictably. (A quick side note here is that I'm talking about original theatrical releases, since BvS Uncut is ultimately superior to this and I have reviewed that also.)2.5 out of 4 stars sounds about right.",6,3,11,4 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Edward Snowden Strikes Back
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier fixes some of my complaints of the first movie. In my review for The First Avenger, I opined that I never felt convinced about the relationship between Steve Rogers and his best friend Bucky Barnes. This film does a much better job going back and delving into that relationship to make it seem more convincing and relevant. If you are wondering why I mention Bucky Barnes in a movie called the Winter Soldier, well, connect the dots and keep in mind that I did warn you with a spoiler alert.Scarlet Johansson is at her best as Black Widow as the relationship between her and Captain America really develops as she finally takes responsibility for her previous mistakes. Also, Anthony Mackie is a wonderful addition to the Avengers as Falcon and seems like less of a throwaway than Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye.I believe the film does a decent job mulling over the moral implication of mass surveillance programs, and you even feel some empathy for some of the villains and their goals. As a result, Captain America: The Winter Soldier does seem to be the most morally relevant of the MCU films to date.My only complaint with this film is it seems a bit rushed at some points and the plot comes together a bit too conveniently; it seems like a lot has to go right (or wrong depending on which side you are) for things to come together in the epic finale. I guess I'm just not convinced that so many people (police, S.H.I.E.L.D., politicians) were working on the bad side without there being leaks. Maybe I'm naive but maybe not.The Winter Soldier gets 3.5 out of 4 hydras.",8,0,1,21 August 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," Old-Fashioned Heroes
","I feel like Captain America: The First Avenger could have been a lot more. The cast of characters does an admirable job. The use of time period set pieces is quite effective and a refreshing throwback for superhero film. At the same time, the film lacks a certain 'je ne sais quoi' and ultimately presented the biggest challenge for me to describe.After some distillation, one of the film's weaknesses, in my opinion, is the slightly straightforward plot. I understand that Captain America is one of the original superheroes and can lay claim to some of the superhero tropes, the use of an octopus-branded rogue secret society with claims for world domination sure does sound familiar. (Yes, Hydra merely comes across as a knockoff of James Bonds' nemesis group Spectre.) Again, I enjoy the use of World War II as the time period, but still dock a bit for originality, but I feel they should have done more to make Hydra their own.The relationship between Steve Rogers (Captain America) and Bucky Barnes seems a bit rushed, especially given its importance later on. I guess I was not totally convinced that the two were best friends; instead they come across as military comrades and friends by necessity, but not best pals.My final problem with Captain America: The First Avenger revolves around some of the realism, or lack thereof. At times the movie is really violent, even showing gunshots and blood on screen, earning its PG-13 rating. Other times, the film glosses over the cost of the war and leaves the titular character as a bit one-dimensional and hokey. As a result, the movie seems a bit wishy- washy and tries to have it both ways and muddles the message of the film, which is (I think) that every person can contribute during tough times.All that said, I loved the awkward and old-fashioned relationship between Rogers (Chris Evans) and British agent Peggy Carter (the lovely Hayley Atwell). Tommy Lee Jones plays a delightfully crotchety military office and shows once again that he is such a consistent actor (just forget about Batman Forever...). Finally, the appearance of Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) helps relate this to the other Marvel films and gives you the impression the filmmakers know what they are doing.For the most part, they do, but I'm not as enthusiastic about this one. The Cap'n gets 2.5 out of 4 stars.",6,0,0,9 August 2016
Man of Steel," Men of Stupid Decisions
","Man of Steel is an average movie with quite a few flaws. Henry Cavill, who plays Superman, looks and plays the part quite well, and I enjoyed the fact that the film deals with his character struggles as being a person...er, a being, trapped between two worlds. The allusions to the DC Extended Universe are quite fun, and you'll see them if you are familiar with the source material. I also believe that Amy Adams, a fantastic actress, plays her role as Lois Lane well, although sometimes the script leaves one wanting more for her to do than taking orders from the men around her.Another highlight of the film is Michael Shannon, who makes an excellent General Zod. He truly sounds the part and I was left feeling quite empathetic towards him regardless of how genocidal he is.The first of my two major problems comes as a rather simple one. The special effects seem unconvincing and too reliant on the green screen. Even the explosions seemed computer generated and that left me disappointed. Also, the overall feel and color scheme of the film reeks too much of the bleakness of the Nolan-verse. I expect Superman's Metropolis to be more brightly-colored and optimistic. I make exception to this complaint with the scenes in Kansas that are beautifully shot, and the cinematography of the more religious scenes, which I did enjoy as well. More on Kansas later.My other complaint revolves around my belief that Man of Steel demonstrates that bad decisions are not unique to this Earth. I find it highly unlikely that Jor-El (Russell Crowe) would be the only one with any foresight as to the challenges facing Krypton. Besides Jor-El and even Zod, the rest of the Kryptonians seem rather clueless and I was sort of cheering for Zod in their conflict.Finally with this criticism, back to Kansas. I don't know if it was just me, but it seemed like half the state and their mothers knew where to find Clark Kent, yet no one at the Daily Planet besides Lois connected the dots. The makes the fact that Clark Kent looks like Superman with glasses when he works at the newspaper even more unconvincing. I guess journalism is in as bad a shape as they say?I give Man of Steel 2 out of 4 stars.",5,3,7,7 August 2016
Collateral," ColLAteral Confidential
","Action and adventure movies are meant to immerse the audience in a sparkly and (sometimes literally) explosive plot, silly as they may be, so that we forget our own lives for a couple of hours in a manic episode of escapism. Good action movies place the viewer in a seemingly real-word scenario to which they can relate a bit more convincingly and can even make us feel all too interconnected and even paranoid. I'm thinking of the recent films that use the oft-used formula, albeit a somewhat tiring one, of espionage in the modern area, some of which (Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation) do a better job than others (Jason Bourne).Then there are the rare action thrillers that place us in a setting we recognize, yet make us feel so very alone and trivial as human beings. Collateral fits this description. Tom Cruise, who plays the nihilistically charming hit-man Vincent, and Jamie Foxx, who plays the pathetically jaded cab driver Max, both knock their performances out of the park.Mark Ruffalo makes an appearance as a trustworthy LA beat detective, only to show you where those qualities lead you and reinforces how meaningless and random life can be. Paradoxically, by the end, Max's character does a 180 and challenges Vince's proposition of people being merely 'lost in space,' that even if we don't know 'the guy in the trunk,' sometimes growth can develop from even the deaths of seemingly corrupt individuals, or society as a whole.With an excellent soundtrack to boot, any action movie buff would be happy to be resigned to mere collateral for a couple of hours, if only to see that this film is one of the most unique in the increasingly insignificant pantheon of films within the genre. 4 out of 4 stars.",10,0,2,3 August 2016
Batman Begins," The Godfather of Reboots
","I believe that Batman Begins depicts Gotham and the titular character as originally intended. Despite the fact that DC has received a lot of recent flak, Marvel, James Bond, Mission Impossible, and even Jason Bourne have quite a few reasons to thank this entry into the Batman canon for their own reboots and/or reinventions.Christian Bale plays a conflicted Bruce Wayne/Batman in a way that helped James Bond rediscover his similar feel and origins a year later in Casino Royale. Bale handles the role well, particularly in the early pre-Batman scenes and later playboy billionaire ones. Kudos also to Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson who provide bits of irony, comic relief, and even introspection here and there. I would also recommend the short animated anthology Batman Year One, from which Batman Begins gets much of its story.I also enjoyed Cillian Murphy as the creepy psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane and Michael Wilkinson, who makes a terrific gangster. Katie Holmes received some criticism for her role, but I was not strongly offended by her acting, though she is one of the weaker points in the film.The best character in the film, and the overall trilogy but particularly in this film, is Gotham City itself, which comes across as one of the best dystopias in film history. The Narrows may be lost, but Batman Begins put the genre in capable hands and sets a high bar and deserves the full 4 out of 4 bat signals.",10,2,4,7 August 2016
The Dark Knight," Not Just a Game of Chance
","Just like Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart, Christopher Nolan didn't leave the creation of this film to a game of chance. Instead, he made his own luck and his fingerprints are all over this masterpiece. Besides being the best comic book movie to date, this is one of the greatest movies all all-time in any genre.I mentioned Aaron Eckhart, who plays the admirable White Knight D.A. of Gotham. His girlfriend Rachel, this time played a bit more convincingly by Maggie Gyllenhaal, graces the screens and represents Bruce Wayne's lost hope for a normal life and his seemingly eternal damnation to be the Batman. The beauty of the Batman character in this movie is that Bruce is both reluctant to play the character but consumed by his monstrosity at the same time. These characters, along with Gary Oldman's Lt. Gordon form the main group of protagonists, and Oldman steals the screen at points with a few pleasant surprises.This time, Batman must stop the Joker, his main nemesis in the comics. To say the Joker's plain is plainly sick is not entirely accurate, because he really doesn't have a plan. Instead, he pushes the right buttons to demonstrate how chaotic life really is and how he is no different from anyone else, including Batman.As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that Joker's fingerprints are all over every event and that he adapts to any situation in order to bring Gotham to its knees, and his plan has elements of the famous Killing Joke comic. Credit Heath Ledger who plays the most convincing and deeply developed villain in movie history perhaps, even though we ironically know very little about him personally.In the end, this rather long film races by with all sorts of surprises as the Joker tries to put the joke on us. The Dark Knight gets 4 out of 4 gag guns.",10,0,1,17 August 2016
Thor," More Than a (Bifrost) Bridge Filler
","I have to admit I have a soft spot for this movie. Thor brings children's bed-time stories to life with an excellent cast and fun set of characters. The flaws in the plot, of which there are several, mitigate themselves with a delightfully refreshing overall story about the growth of the main character, Thor.If there is anything wrong with Thor, it is with the setup. In particular, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) does not come across as a particularly wise king, when it is obviously clear that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is way too immature. Another sign of how weak Odin is comes in the form of pretty much every character in Asgard disobeying him for any reason. I point this out because I don't think it was director Kenneth Branagh's idea to depict the all-powerful Odin as so feeble.I also am a bit confused about some of the magical principles of the film. For instance, the story line of Odin and his power (or lack thereof) has a bit too much deus ex machina in it. That said, I enjoyed Loki and Heimdall (Tom Hiddleston and Idris Elba, both in the running to play the next James Bond ironically). Loki in particular develops into a stronger character as the film progresses.Finally, Natalie Portman pulls off the enamored scientist role pretty well and she and Hemsworth show quite the sexual tension. Thor gets 3 out of 4 hammers.",7,0,2,8 August 2016
The Witch," Weirdly Wonderful
","This film might not be for everyone, but if you can get past the weird accents (which I have to think the filmmakers put an awful lot of time into developing) the Witch works. My suggestion is not to watch this as a traditional horror film in the sense of scary spooks jumping out, but as a case study into societal norms of Puritan womanhood in an increasingly modern world. Yes, the Witch has a feminist resonance to it. I even think the use of two V's in the title instead of a W allude to this. If you're not sure to what I'm referring, I suggest reading up on the goddess Venus and her connotations.In this light, the Witch makes a lot more sense and deserves all 4 out of 4 stars.",10,5,8,28 July 2016
Sausage Party," Food Fights
","No one will ever confuse Sausage Party with Casablanca, Citizen Kane, or Gone with the Wind, but nevertheless, it is a lot of (very mature) fun. I still prefer Superbad and the Interview to Sausage Party, but this new release is an improvement of other Seth Rogen works such as Pineapple Express and the Neighbors.One thing Sausage Party that I enjoyed is how it handles the idea of faith and religion. There are surprisingly profound tidbits intermingled between all the hot dog and bun jokes. As for the jokes, not all of them are original and some of the ones that are become a bit overused and forced. At the same time, I think some of the point of the good jokes is to poke fun at bad stereotypical jokes.Overall, Sausage Party succeeds due to its sheer absurdity and the outrageous originality of its initial idea and deserves 3 out of 4 hot dogs.",7,14,29,11 August 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," The Bane That Broke the Bat's Back
","More so than any movie in the Nolan-verse trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises requires several viewings for its impact to sink in. As it will always draw comparisons to its predecessor, The Dark Knight, it is worth making some of my own. Whereas The Dark Knight played out like the flash of cigarette dropped into gasoline, The Dark Knight Rises is more like a slow burning cigar making its way to a powder keg of gunpowder.In this film, the charade of hope that Batman created in two films finally comes collapsing down around him and everything slowly goes to anarchy and hell, as Tom Hardy's Bane plans it. The depiction of Bane, while not on the level of Ledger's Joker, is one thing the movie nails. Instead of portraying the character as a blundering idiot as in previous films, The Dark Knight Rises really allows the psychological as well as the physical strengths of the character to come out.The usual cast is back, along with the sassy Anne Hathaway as Catwoman and lovely Marion Cotillard as a Wayne Enterprises board member who empathizes with Bruce. After seeing this film several times now, I feel comfortable to give it 4 out of 4 stars.",10,1,3,17 August 2016
Iron Man," Solid Iron with a Bit of Rust
","In 2008 the Marvel Cinematic Universe exploded on the scene and, along with Batman Begins, resurrected the genre, as well as Robert Downey, Jr.'s career. In fact, RDJ is the absolute perfect person to play a wealthy, drunken, playboy, cavalier, and talented celebrity who sobers up both literally and takes responsibility for his actions in a complex world because, well, that's kind of what his real life was like.Jeff Bridges, per the usual, does an excellent job at not phoning in his performance and once again shows his range as an actor as he did in movies like Seabiscuit, The Big Lebowski, and (especially) True Grit. It's hard to compare any of these previous roles to this current role as Tony Stark's (Downey) business partner Obadiah Stane. Public gaffes and reputation aside, Gwyneth Paltrow demonstrates quite a bit of chemistry as Pepper Potts, Stark's do-it-all assistant.Iron Man does an excellent job of developing Tony Stark's conscience as the facade of his desire to protect the nation collapses around him and transforms him into the Iron Man who can't seem to trust anyone but Pepper and military liaison 'Rhodey' (Terrence Howard).The film does come off as a bit rusty, in that the villain wants no more than money and power, which sounds generic, but based on what I know fits in with the source material. Anyway, without giving much away, the villain does a great job acting and adapting with the plot developments, and in the end this bit of rust gives the movie character, just as rust does to any well-aged structure. And nearly a decade after release, Iron Man sure has aged well, possibly better than any film in the MCU, and therefore is a classic superhero movie that does just enough to earn 4 out of 4 stars.",10,0,1,7 August 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Dawn of Just-Give-It-Another-Chance
","I'm going to make this one short. Whether you've seen the theatrical cut or not, check out the uncut. While still imperfect and silly at points (Are you a terrorist, anyone?), the uncut edition does a better job developing the overall plot, namely the desert scenes in context with Luthor's overall scheme, and Bruce Wayne's motivation in relation to Superman's presence and perceived threat to Earth.Yes, it's still average as far as special effects go and Wonder Woman still lacks screen time. It's (somehow) still rushed at a nearly 3 hour running time, but it is a decided improvement and a better interpretation of what Zack Snyder wanted.Uncut gets 3 out of 4 stars.",7,0,0,28 July 2016
Thor: The Dark World," A Low Key (Loki) Entry
","Thor: The Dark World picks on Asgard at some point after the events of The Avengers. The Tesseract is safe. Thor has the good graces of Odin. Heimdall watches over a repaired Bifrost. Most importantly, Loki faces charges for his crimes on Earth. Lurking, however, is Malekith and his Dark Elves who wish to unleash the power of the Aether on the Nine Realms and return the universe to darkness.Overall, I don't really care about any of this stuff, save for one exception (more on that later). Thor: The Dark World struggles to improve on one of my biggest complaints of the first film; the nature of Odin's power and the Asgardians' immortality. The rules of the Eternal Realm seem too fast, loose, convenient, and underdeveloped for me to feel engaged, and once again, Odin comes across more as Mad King Ludwig than the Allfather.The new additions of Malekith and the Aether seem unconvincing as well, in that the former lacks screen presence and the latter doesn't really differentiate itself from the Tesseract. In the end, deus ex machina and weirdly times jokes rule the day and seems to answer any questions the viewer may have, or even distract one from them.Despite my complaints, Tom Hiddleston nearly puts on a one-man show as Loki, and delivers the best of his three performances in the MCU. Chris Hemsworth does a serviceable job as Thor as well, but Hiddleston certainly stands out and almost does enough to allow me to give this film a solid recommendation. 2.5 out of 4 stars.",6,0,0,13 August 2016
The Great Escape," The Original Great Escape, Not Those Songs
","The Great Escape is sure a lot of fun. I was unsure whether a film of this magnitude could pull off all these characters, but I can say it does an admirable job at that. All the characters also admirably show what a person will do in order to obtain freedom, all the while depicting their German captors in a not so unsympathetic light; there is still chivalry among the armies.As far as characters are concerned, Steve McQueen, James Garner, and Richard Attenborough really stand out as Allied captives. One minor character I enjoyed was the German soldier Werner, who has a funny interaction with Garner's character in the barracks.The last thirty minutes of The Great Escape dawdle a bit and come across as a bit of a footnote at first, until the viewer realizes the full scope and objective of the plan. Overall, there is a ton to like and this film is close enough to perfect to deserve a 4 out of 4 star rating.",9,1,3,3 August 2016
