The Avengers," Revolutionising the superhero genre
","This movie took four superhero franchises and created one of the best crossovers of all time. The movie excels in almost everything. The acting is amazing, and all the actors of each of the superheroes will continue to be the faces of those superheroes for years to come. The comedy is also a lot better than a lot of 'comedy' movies. Loki is a really charming and likeable villain, and he steals a lot of the scenes he is in. The music is also pretty damn good.The plot however, is a bit predictable, but it works, and the movie isn't terrible as a standalone movie. The character interactions in this film is pretty good and does display the personalities of the characters quite well.This movie is a lot of fun to watch, and definitely worth rewatching. I'd consider it one of the best superhero movies and one that has revolutionised the genre, as other studios such as DC are trying to replicate the success of these movies.",9,0,0,15 June 2019
Aquaman," 0/10 lol
","Everything is pretty bad in this movie. It's like the star wars prequels, except with a far larger budget and technology but still ends up looking not much better somehow. The DCEU is just trash.",1,3,6,25 July 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," An epic first act to a two act epic
","Infinity War is Thanos' movie, and it works. It's told from the perspective of the Avengers, but the whole film is to build up the character of Thanos, and he will be remembered as a pop culture icon for years to come, much like Darth Vader for Star Wars. When we remember the big villains of the MCU, Thanos will come to mind, and Thanos makes this movie great.It's special effects are also probably some of the best in movie history, as to be expected from the budget, but even some movies with similar budget can't pull off special effects this good *cough* justice league *cough*This is the ultimate gift to a marvel fan, this and Endgame, and I would say this would be amazing to watch back to back with Endgame as a two-part epic.",10,1,1,15 June 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Disappointing
","Its not bad by any means. The special effects definitely make a case that the budget was used accordingly, and the actors are all (mostly) good, but the writing kinda just sucks.For a movie with less main characters than Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, it somehow feels more crowded, and the main villain Ultron is so boring. Ultron is just an evil version of Iron Man, but more one dimensional. He's not a killer robot hellbent on destroying the world with no emotion like the trailers and title suggested, he's just a goofball robot who fights the avengers, hes not interesting at all!And quicksilver, the biggest disappointment of the movie. Quicksilver seriously cannot be called a character. His defining character traits are that hes a Russian dude and hes fast, and they're not really even character traits! Days of Future Past which came out a year before this movie has a way better Quicksilver by miles and miles. Why is he in this movie? He doesn't actually do anything? If you remove him from the plot, nothing major changes, and he doesn't affect any future movies at all! Quicksilver actually just bloats the already extremely crowded movie.To clarify: the writing of the plot sucks in this movie. This movie has some good scenes and character interaction like the bar scene, but the general plot of the movie is so predictable and cliche, it took no risks and after a while it becomes just boring, especially towards the end.This movie overall is ok, its watchable on a first watch, but I would never rewatch this movie. If its your first time watching the Avengers movies, this one isn't terrible, but its far from the best unfortunately.",6,2,3,15 June 2019
Joker," Screenplay leaves things to be desired, otherwise great
","Few problems with the pacing, and some cliche 'checklist' type scenes in the movie, and the background storyline setup could have used more attention, but otherwise really good film and killer third act. Joaquin Phoenix is perfect in this movie (well, the role was written for him) and despite a bit of muddled messages from the movie, It's definitely not one that would incite incel violence or anything of the sort. The movie is ultimately more about mental illness and socioeconomic class.",8,1,1,7 October 2019
Parasite," Funny and chilling
","The movie itself is technically a masterpiece, its well written and it has good messages which arent hamfisted or overly 'pandery'",10,2,7,19 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," So much better than the Rise of Skywalker
","Rewatched this recently. Honestly wasted potential on the new cast. They really did have good chemistry between Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac but in the end it was all squandered. The mystery box stuff set up in this film could have gone places and Adam Driver plays an actual interesting character with great potential... but I guess we know how this trilogy turned out. So disappointing. Not to say this movie is a masterpiece or anything but its at least decent even though its very unoriginal, other aspects are done well.",Null,4,8,23 December 2019
