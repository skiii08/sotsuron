Sucker Punch," Didn't expect much - would have had to expect even less...
","Just a short comment on all that metaphor-seeking screenplay-fascinated guys: i don't see any point in all of this.in fact, the pictures are BIG. yes, but big isn't GREAT. because GREAT pictures would be fascinating, you just couldn't stop watching, caught by the tension - yes, that would've been great.oh yes, and the metaphors, thank you guys, yes, you could talk hours afterward and discuss about all possibilities there are - but what if there are none? what if there is only tits and lame smooth pop-rock? and BTW, the tits weren't even BIG ;-) just kidding.no, there's nothing in special i could say about this movie. there is lame action, and there is big pictures. but beyond being absurd there's only little to explore. and even Absurdity itself is only absurd because of being meaningless.so why do i still rate with 4 stars? Well, the Pictures are really big and the animations are very pretty. That's why.",4,1,5,23 August 2011
