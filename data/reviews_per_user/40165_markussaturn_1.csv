The Avengers," Fun, Action Packed, Entertaining...Go for it!
","The movie is vastly entertaining. The Action scenes are amazing and satisfying. Nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences. I felt as if there was not a single bad performance. Each of the characters brought their personality (from their respective movie) to the table. Marc Ruffalo...brilliant and a welcome addition and so much better than the last Hulk - Edward Norton. When Mark Ruffalo was first announced to play Bruce Banner, i didn't know what to think of it. I knew that he's a good actor. All he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character out of him. I really hope they make an Incredible Hulk movie sequel starring Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner.Joss Whedon did one hell of a Job directing and writing this original script... the end title sequence is like 20,000 names long... wow. Amazing to think how he was able to juggle that and pull this film off. Highly Recommend!",9,1,4,19 May 2012
