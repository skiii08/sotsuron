Casablanca," Casablanca Review
","I enjoyed most of Casablanca. I thought that the performances were good and it was just a beatify shot film. The story was the only the only problem for me. the pacing was too fast and I couldn't really get into it and then it just ends. The ending wasn't my favorite either with him sacrificing his love for the girl to be happy was predicable to me and didn't leave me 'wow-ed' by it. I think if the pacing was better put together it would be more appealing and easier to follow I would've enjoyed the movie more than I did, but the performances, music and looks of the film help it to be a good movie. That is why I give Casablanca a 7/10.",7,0,1,15 October 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes of Wrath Review
",I enjoyed The Grapes of Wrath more then I have enjoyed John Ford's classic western types of movies. I found the story of the family a lot more interesting then I thought I was going to and in this movie you start to care about all the charters involved in the story which makes it a better movie if it can pull that off with a good story. Henry Fonda as Tom gives a great performance and really brings the story forward revolving around him. John Ford as did a great job directing and the film looks great and is really clean which for me makes the watching the movie a lot better. That is why The Grapes of Wrath gets an 8/10.,8,0,1,8 October 2014
Annie Hall," Annie Hall
",Annie Hall is a movie I just could not get into. The story wasn't anything special with it just being a classic love story with them thinking they were for each other but end up just being friends. I also didn't think any of Woody Allen's jokes were funny and just felt like stand up bits put into a romantic comedy script. The only thing I enjoyed was Diane Keaton's performance I thought she was an interesting character and she pulled it off well. Overall I just think this type of comedy is for me and that is why I dint enjoy and am not a big fan of Woody Allen either and think it might of been better to cast someone else in the lead part. That is why Annie Hall gets a 5/10.,5,0,2,10 December 2014
The Graduate," The Graduate Review
","The Graduate is not your typical comedy. It has very fumy scenes with a serious undertone of adultery and love. The story is a good one with all the characters being likable and towards the end you have very strong feelings for all of them being good or bad based on what you think of the film. The thing that stood out the most was the cinematography and how well it was shot. the editing, lighting and camera work is something we don't see as much in comedy's now a days with them doing nothing spectacular with the actions listed above. That is what I think separates The Graduate, from all other comedies I have ever seen, because of how passionate and well done the filmmaking is mixed in with a great cast, story and characters makes The Graduate an instant classic for me and gets a 9/10.",9,0,0,26 November 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain Review
","Singin' in the Rain is a very well done musical. The story and music is great of the three main characters trying to save one of their worst movies to date and turn it into a musical so people will enjoy it more then the cheesy drama it once was. The music is really exciting and all the songs were enjoyable and there was one song towards the end that ran a little longer then it needed to. The dancing is also great everyone is on point and I think Cosmo's solo song and dance was the best part of the film because it used the set pieces and comedy great. Overall, I really enjoyed Singin' in the Rain more than I thought I would and would watch it again. It gets an 8/10.",8,0,1,5 November 2014
