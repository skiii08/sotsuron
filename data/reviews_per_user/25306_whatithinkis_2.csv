Blade Runner 2049," Where is the beauty
","Of Zhora's crackling glass? The Poetry of 'like tears in rain?' The charm of 'Good evening, J.F!' The fury of Pris's gymnastics? The NOIR of Deckard's voiceover? How is this ugly beigeness even entertainment?And not only is it NOT entertainment, it is a crime against the power of its progenitor. It is a weak wannabe that is not . . . NOT 'Blade Runner.'",1,9,17,4 August 2018
Lords of Dogtown," This is an absorbing film
","It pulled me in despite the fact that I am neither a surf nor skate board fan, found Heath Ledger's performance (and I love Heath RIP) awful (kept thinking he was Val Kilmer), felt it lacked typical story advancement. It's just great fun, an interesting story, nostalgic and beautifully filmed.",8,1,1,5 March 2019
