The New World," Like Watching War Paint Dry
","Let me first say that I am a big fan of historical epics. As a matter of fact I joyfully sat through all 6+ hours of Bertolucci's '1900' in one sitting at a revival house; in short, I am not some dolt who wandered in because 'Underworld 2' was sold out.That said and trying to avoid hyperbole, this is among the most pretentious, self-flaggelating, ponderous pieces of bullshit ever forced upon an unsuspecting public. I was so bored I actually felt nauseated.Mr. Malick does not know the first thing about dramatic writing-that is why 60% of the words heard in the film are voiceovers by John Smith, Pocohontas and The Tobacco Farmer That Looks Like a Movie Star-who even though they are respectively a military man, a Native American princess and a One Dimensional Plot Device all narrate with essentially the same voice. This gets old rather quickly. If all three of these characters have the ability to narrate, then from whose perspective is the story unfolding? The answer to that question is the obsessive camera that luxuriates on floral shots that look like they are outtakes from Walt Disney's True Life Adventure Series, while the real action is relegated offstage.It is surely a case of The Emperor Has No Clothes here, people are afraid to call the movie painfully dull due to the pretensions of artsy-fartsy that are present; worried they will be accused of 'not getting it.' This is the reason that the reviews amongst professional critics are evenly split 50/50 between raves and pans, very few are middle ground. This alone should warn the moviegoer that one should tread forward with great caution if planning to see this snoozefest.One last thought: He cut seventeen minutes from this? If it had gone on for seventeen minutes longer I would have woven Ju-Ju Bees into a rope and hung myself.",1,115,207,26 January 2006
The Rocker," A Nice Sleeper
","I have a funny feeling this flick will get wider exposure on DVD and become a cult hit, though it deserved much more than being dumped into theatres in late August with little fanfare and minimal box office. It's one of those movies that make you go, 'Why didn't this do well when it was in the theatre?' A collection of Hollywood's finest B-List But Much More Talented Than The A-List Actors pull off a funny yet sad portrait of the Rock 'n Roll life and dashed dreams. So many have commented that this seemed like a rejected Jack Black vehicle; but thank god for Rainn Wilson, who manages to create so many distinct characters in various projects from one quirky personality-whereas Jack Black is always Jack Black.",7,2,5,27 August 2008
