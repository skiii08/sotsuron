Hereditary," Family horror at its best
","Something I've found myself asking over the years is: what's passed down to us from our parents and their parents? What unlucky numbers did we inherit, which bad gene or nasty outlook did we have no choice but to accept from those who came before us? 'Hereditary,' Ari Aster's first full feature length takes that question and delivers one of the most disturbing answers through a highly stylised, tightly created descent into madness.Annie has lost her mother to, what sounds like, ill mental health. The grief of the loss, the blame she feels, and the pressure of keeping herself together for her family's sake are causing her severe stress. What begins as a slow burn family drama that sees her despondent son, Peter, turn to drugs for comfort and her daughter, Charlie, to obscenely isolating acts of art, takes a brutal curve ball and from that moment begins to unravel every member of the family.Horror works at its best when you don't see it coming, and 'Hereditary' works hard to keep you in the dark until the final act without losing you to confusion or boredom. It does this by offering up the flawed and human family going through a traumatic loss. Annie and her brood are relatable in their desire to work through the issues, all while their worlds collapse around them. The tones and themes explored are all troubling and difficult to approach, but Aster and the cast work so well to keep it all together from start to finish.Before the acts of gore and violence begin, the film works well to create an uneasy filter to see the family through. As Annie, Toni Collette looks like she's barely together from the very start, so to see her bad parenting and her own husband's suspicions of her actions doesn't ever feel improbable. The use of close ups and quick cuts gives a palpable sense of terror that builds throughout endless scenes of school hallways, entrance halls, a tree house and Annie's workshop. Everyone's grief and despair adds on and on into every scene and bad decisions are not hard to understand.The light in it all is Joanie, a friendly face who offers Annie a listening ear and the knowledge to contact the dead in search of answers. Ann Dowd is perfect as the grieving homebody, nurturing, if a little needy and imposing. Contrast her light scenes with the family dinners, or Annie's inability to articulate at all with Peter, Charlie or her husband, Stephen. There may not be villains within the family, but they're all far too damaged to support each other when it's needed.'Hereditary' really pays off all its meticulous efforts to twist the screws. By the time the horrors are coming out of the shadows and blood is flowing, it feels mightily cathartic, yet still deeply harrowing thanks to so much care put into developing the suffering family. The final tableau of horrors, juxtaposed with the caring voices and joyous score is one that could remain spoken about in horror circles for years.10/10",10,0,3,28 December 2018
The Exorcist," ehhhhh...sorry, can u repeat that?
","i'm awfully sorry but could people please reconsider what they have said about this movie being excellent, perfect, scary, horrifying, shocking, yatata yatata. This movie is none of those things. When it was voted most scariest movie i could not believe it...scary? the only thing scary was the part where i couldn't breathe from laughing so much. Watching Linda Blair smothered in make up screaming with a dirty males voice all the abusive terms under the sun did nothing but tickle my ribs. There was no real menace here, the devil was stuck inside a little girl, what was he honestly gonna do? poke out the eyes of her teddies? I will say one thing, the acting was OK but this wasn't a horror, u want horror u watch a nightmare on elm street or something with a menace, this is just tripe, but of course if you are feeling down and need a laugh watch this.",1,7,27,18 June 2005
Avengers: Infinity War," A Massive, Glorious Spectacle, but wondrously incomplete
","It's finally here. He's finally here. As the Hulk crashes back to Earth, and Bruce Banner returns, he gasps ,'Thanos is coming.' Back in 2010, Scream 4 was announced (Scream is my favourite horror movie), and I spent every day hungrily watching trailers and spots over and over, trying to figure out what was gonna happen. 7 years later, Infinity War released its first teaser and I had the same sense of excitement that came with the knowledge of a new Scream film. Finally, all the characters and stories would be coming together in one almighty show down of good vs evil. But just like the false starts in Scream 4, and the false endings, I was not ready for this. I don't think anyone can be.The action begins where Ragnarok left off; Thanos has discovered the refugee Asgardians and attacks them, hoping to get the Tesseract. Thanos is not playing around. The scene is barely over before New York is under attack again and that feeling of finality hurtling toward you doesn't let up until the credits roll. Marvel definitely took a gamble and I think it paid off. I'm amazed at the negative reviews I'm reading because it truly informs how spoiled we are that this movie received anything less than critical acclaim. It is bombastic and filled with characters that over 10 years have developed, the acting is stellar, the various tones of the different directors over the past 19 movies seeps into every detail from the colourful and playful Guardians, Thor's off beat humour, Iron Man's cripplingly humane sense of responsibility, Spiderman's youthful 
 and exuberant laissez faire, Captain America's seriousness and Dr. Strange's mystical mind melting graphics. It's all here. Not to mention the sheer ecstasy of the return to Wakanda. Black Panther may have just come out but there's no denying the impact T'Challa and company have had on the Marvel universe.What's more, these characters are so fleshed out and clearly defined that to see them work in tandem, and there are some surprising team ups, is just cinematic joy at a different level than I've ever experienced. Somehow, within all of this, there is even time to deliver character development and true pathos to characters such as Thor (whose story, on reflection, truly is devastating, even if he is a God), Gamora (Zoe Saldana deserves massive credit for delivering some great work against what I can only assume is a man covered in green screen during filming) and Groot, who has so little to do, and yet so much to do with the story.The movie, however, belongs to Thanos. He is present in every scene. Even if not physically, his presence is felt as the Avengers and Guardians do everything they can to prevent his goal of gaining all the stones. In all honesty, the movie should have been called 'Thanos.' If Ms. Mojo was naming it, it would be 'Top 10 Avenger Fails.'But, there are problems. Big ones, actually. First of all, if you have not seen many (and I mean many, not just a few) of the Marvel films, you may really struggle to join the ride. There is a lot of story involved and even though there is a small bit of exposition at the beginning, every scene is crammed with different characters with motivations that without context will feel alienating to many. Many characters are sidelined and it's hard not to believe that they are given lines just to remind us they're there. If you're a fan of Black Widow, Bucky or Shuri, check your expectations at the ticket booth. Further, it reveals itself to be a first part in a two parter towards the end which ultimately delivers a fatalistic and very depressing note. When 'Empire Strikes Back' ended, it was on a message of hope. When 'Infinity War' finishes, you know there's a sequel planned but that doesn't mean the writers should be let off the hook for how they end the first part. Still, this is an amazing accomplishment and deserves to be seen at the cinema.",10,2,3,29 April 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," An utter mess, a complete disappointment
","I'm being kind by giving it 6 stars.While not the worst in the X-Men franchise (that accolade still goes to Origins), Apocalypse is a film that never makes it out of the starting gate and stumbles towards a dull, fantastically messy end. I waited two weeks after the release to go watch. Having heard nothing but bad reviews, I said to myself 'These people have high expectations after Civil War and Days of Future Past.' Obviously, I too had high expectations but I reminded myself to accept it at face value: as entertainment. It was clear from the very beginning when Xavier (James McAvoy) began his speech about mutants and humans that this series had run aground, was out of steam. Everything about the film has been done in previous ones and has been done better. The action is limp, the special effects are bombastic but uncharacteristically unimaginative. Characters dissolve into puddles of nostalgia and dreariness. What remains of plot is nothing but a hodge-podge of half-baked strands from the previous films - Jean Grey and her worrisome dark Phoenix power, Xavier trying to convince Magneto not to be evil, Magneto trying to be good but ultimately letting evil win over, Cyclops trying not to blast Jean Grey. Hell, even Wolverine turns up just long enough for him to escape from Stryker and get his memories back (cause that already happened in X-Men, X-2 and Origins, right?). In the previous 3 films (Wolverine, First Class and Days of Future Past), a lot of effort was put into location and setting. Part of the fun was the attention to detail as these established characters navigated various periods or cultures. The groovy spy flavours added to First Class and the mind bending, time bending disaster epic of DOFP helped elevate those films beyond simple superhero fare. Sadly, Singer has dispensed with setting or detail and plays this simply as a monster of the week episode of Buffy. And while we visit Poland, USA and Egypt in the 1980s, they could be anywhere. The closest we get to the decade is a throwaway conversation about Star Wars and the Eurythmics 'Sweet Dreams' in another Quicksilver set piece.The direction, and this is a major upset for me because I think Singer is fantastic, is dire. At no point does he even bother to build tension or ratchet up suspense towards the inevitable conclusion or good vs evil. His villain, Apocalypse, spends 3/4 of the film trying to get his team together and the final quarter losing. For all his apparent smarts, he chooses the worst possible horsemen in Storm (a self-confessed fan of Mystique), Magneto (who apparently has tried living in communist Poland with disastrous consequences), Angel (a drunk) and Psylocke (apparently a great fighter). None of them interact with each other, none of them do much other than stand around, gurning at the camera. Needless to say the twists as members turn on him and others get defeated easily doesn't come as a surprise. There's little offered that suggests that Apocalypse is a force to be reckoned with and his team do nothing but grin and stand behind him for majority of the film. Bizarrely, Stryker turns up halfway through but his appearance is confusing and does nothing to propel the story. So far the story seems to be that Apocalypse wants horsemen and that seems to be it for plot.None of the cast get much to do. The new additions are quiet and behave in a confused manner. Apocalypse wanders around like Emperor Palpatine but with all the menace of Father Jack. Oscar Isaac tries to chew up the scenery as Vincent Price, it just made me want to watch Vincent Price. Much excitement was incited when Jubilee turned up in the cast list but clearly she isn't Singer's type because she has even less to do than some Egyptian fanatics at the very beginning. There is a repeat of Quicksilver's hilarious power but it serves only to highlight the lack of ideas present. Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan do get more to do than most others but Turner still has a long way to go until she's as captivating as Famke Jansen. Her relationship with Xavier is barely explored so when he begs her to 'let loose! Unleash your power!' you'd be forgiven for wondering why she would when she has probably zero trust in him and he in her. Ultimately, the film is a fail. There's very little to get excited about here. The returning cast deliver their lines with a cringeworthy manner that suggests they're ready to move on and the lack of detail to character, setting and themes proves that Singer has gotten all he can out of the X-Men. Perhaps Fox should bite the bullet and return the X-Men to Marvel before they attempt to 'reboot' the franchise again.",5,3,10,31 May 2016
Jurassic World," Unnecessary Addition
","Jurassic World sees the fruition of John Hammond's work come to life when, 21 years after Jurassic Park opened (and permanently closed) its doors, a new park is successfully up and running. Sadly, for all those involved, humanity is so bored of T. rex and velociraptors that attendance is down and so is sponsorship. Therefore, thanks to Henry Wu (B.D. Wong reprising his role from the original), the lab have created a monster to woo back guests and moolah. Obviously, much like John Hammond's first attempt at messing with nature, things don't turn out as they planned.Chris Pratt is a velociraptor trainer (what?) who is brought in to inspect the fence surrounding this new investment by Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who just happens to have family visiting for the week who are currently going through a crisis. She's far too busy to hang out with her socially misguided nephews and dumps them with her PA. Naturally, they promptly run off. Owen, the trainer, is being wooed by InGen (remember them?) to use these trained velociraptors as weapons of war. The scene is set for carnage. Or is it?What follows is so mind-numbingly dull, obvious and really rather badly put together that you will be forgiven for believing you're watching a cartoon or magic show. The main issue is that, unlike its original predecessor (or even Lost World) it can't make its mind up if its family entertainment or adult horror. This new dinosaur has every ability to terrify and yet instead the characters are faced with these horrific situations in which they remain entirely stoic or consider with mild curiosity. Contrast that with the girl in the original wetting herself before she'd even set eyes on the T-Rex and then entering a fit of cerebral palsy when confronted by a bronchiosaur. Here, two children are brutally attacked and barely a minute later are having a wander around the old jurassic park site, enjoying the murals and technology on show. Not to mention having the wits to hotwire and refuel a car that's over 20 years old. If these horrific acts occur and the characters who are facing them don't care, why should the audience? Part of the problem is pacing. The Indominus Rex escapes 20 minutes into the film, we see it in all it's glory five minutes later and then for another 2 hours watch it tear the park apart. That is far too long a time to watch a set piece implode. Therefore scenes of exposition and moments of incredulity occur to further the plot and push the I. Rex towards the park. When it finally reaches the park, 20,000 guests seem undisturbed by the massacre occurring. One very nasty moment sees a woman repeatedly drowned and bitten by pterodactyls only to be eaten by a much bigger dinosaur and the characters watching do nothing but enjoy the show. Could they actually help? Probably not. Would they watch like it was an episode of Sex and the City? Doubtful, also. And the CGI... the CGI! Good God, the first thing you see is a CG bird and my first thought was 'obviously this is a simulation at the park,' but no, this is real, this is a bird generated by computer graphics that is meant to be in the real world. Great to know that in a movie redolent with CGI that it is going to be rather bad. It really, truly is. No scope, not one iota of attention devoted to realism, this is a cartoon through and through.However, not all of it is bad. The dino fights are brutal and the few new ramifications for the park are wonderful to mull over and talk about after. Chris Pratt, despite playing the worst possible character ever (a velociraptor trainer?!?!?!) manages to remain charismatic and heroic. Bryce D. Howard is also compelling as a control freak watching her World be destroyed bit by bit. All in all, however, my advice is to go home, by the original on blu-ray or 3D, invest in a good TV and sound system and just scare yourself silly with the original. You'll be pleased you did.",5,0,3,1 July 2015
Joker," Decent descent into a demented mind
","'Joker' is good. JoaquÃ­n does an excellent job as lifelong punching bag, Arthur Fleck. He lives with his unwell mother, caring for her and working as a clown for hire. He dreams of being a stand up comedian, working with his hero, Murray Franklin (played by Robert de Niro). But life has other plans. A childhood of abuse and neglect has caused Arthur some serious mental and social issues. But is it his ill health or the ill health of society that will be change him into the clown prince?'joker' played well with ambiguity throughout its runtime. Besides the obvious laugh at inopportune moments, Arthur's mental state, heritage and fate are all cataclysmically mixed up in truth and lie. Where the joke begins and ends depends on the viewer. Even in its final moments, red footprints contrasting the dizzying peace of the blissful scene, its hard to know what has happened just moments before. Todd 'the hangover' Phillips keeps a tight hold on Arthur's story throughout in his direction. The beautiful colour palettes and wondrous gaze of a camera lingering on moments of extreme violence is captivating, to be sure.However, Phillips' style over substance can onyy take him so far and where the film flops is in its decision to dig through the dirt of joker's origin story. Far too streamlined, the film seems to be more interested in ticking boxes on its way to a conclusion, rather than doing anything new. Perhaps his accidental rise to figurehead of a generation disillusioned by disparate wealth is a realistic approach instead of 'falls into toxic vat, comes back as criminal mastermind' but none of the charm of the established Joker is present here. Hes just a sad sack with mental health problems. Even a turning point at the beginning of the final act in which he states hes 'not wrong, this is who I've always been' feels untrue. Joker is a maniac and genius. I wish there had been more hints at his troubled but wonderfully corrupt mind throughout, instead of a final rant that gets cut short.Phillips aimed high, and the cast certainly pulled their weight, but the story, for such an enigmatic, charismatic villain of lore just does not do the source material justice.",7,2,3,14 October 2019
The Purge," confused and not fully explored
","Such a terrific idea gone to waste. It's happened before and it will probably happen again. Sadly, with all its 'Funny Games,' 'Assault on Precinct 13' and 'Them' influences, it manages to be nothing more than a boring, cliché-ridden, confused mess.The premise is simple; one night a year, for 12 hours, the population of the USA have the legal right to commit any crime they desire, including murder. One man and his family have gotten rich off this programme by selling security systems to his rich neighbourhood. This year he's going to get his comeuppance.what could follow is a film that explores the money made on fear and the conspicuous consumption ideology of middle class America and Europe. It's also fun to watch the bourgeoisie get what's coming to them. Instead, shortly after the 'Purge' commences, most sense and ideas go out the window: the writers can't even come up with a decent villain. As soon as the 'Polite Leader' of the freaks arrives, gurning at the Ethan Hawke's terrified James through CCTV, all tension is lost. We know exactly how it will pan out and, unsurprisingly, that's exactly how it pans out. Except, well, the whole Ethan Hawke having awesome combat skills for some lily-livered business man. There's barely a whiff of danger and no game of chess played between hunter and hunted. Unlike other home invasion films (the aforementioned ones as well as 'Panic Room,' in particular), the main characters here seem to have every idea of what is happening and every idea of how to prevent it. There's also very little to fight for in this film; Jodi Foster and Naomi Watts were both fighting for their families in their films and the poor couple in 'Them' were fighting just to stay alive. Ethan Hawke, however charismatic, isn't fighting for the justice or injustice of 'The Purge,' his belief in the system is never clarified and he certainly doesn't seem to be fighting for his family seeing as they all seem too cosy and miserable in their massive home. Sadly, the writers don't know what to do with their cast and characters disappear and reappear on a whim, doing very little but pushing the film towards an inevitable climax. There's a homeless man who puts the gears in motion and some neighbours who are/aren't the family's saviours but they're all so inconsistent. This could have played like a more violent Hitchcock film or at the very least a smarter version of 'Mother's Day' but fails in both aspects - too loose and underdeveloped for Hitchcock and too lacking in conviction and horror to be 'Mother's Day.' The fact that the main antagonist is cornier than Blowfeld makes the whole thing even harder to stomach - was he aiming for Michael Pitt in 'Funny Games?' All in all, the film ends criticising the violence it is based on making the protagonists nothing more than a bunch of cowards who are too afraid to stand up for their convictions. I sincerely doubt that this is the film they wanted to make.",3,1,1,2 February 2014
