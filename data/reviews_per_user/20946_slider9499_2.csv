First Man," Slow, Boring and a Bit Depressing
","The director and write took the single greatest achievement of all-time and made it into a boring, depressing mess. Ryan's Armstrong NEVER smile in this 2+ hour maudelin, static painting of a movie.It spends entirely too much time on his home life. Yes, he 2 yr old died and yes, it is a horrible thing for anyone to go through. But do we need 35 minutes of this before we even get into the NASA program?Armstrong never smiles, laugh or seems to ever enjoy himself, even though he is chosen to be the first man to step on another planet...history in the making and he just shrugs it off. I mean, how many times do we have to have flashbacks to his deceased daughter to know he is depressed and misses her?I was expecting SO MUCH more and got SO MUCH less. Was this nominated for Best Picture? If so, this is yet another reason that If Beale Street Could Talk got screwed over. Dont waste your time with this mess.
I gave 7, because I couldnt get it to 6.5",7,1,1,28 April 2019
The Favourite," Don't Get All the Hype
","I was very curious about this movie. Tons of nominations, great reviews, etc. I watched the entire movie and kept looking at the clock hoping it would end soon.Not funny at all. I maybe, maybe laughed twice thought the 130 minutes. It looked great, liked the music and the acting was good. Annoying constant clock ticking for no reason whatsoever. Asinine plot and simply horrible ending that made absolutely no sense at all.I gave it a 6 only because of the above positive comments. Not as bad as Shakespere in Love, but pretty damn ose.",6,1,3,2 September 2019
