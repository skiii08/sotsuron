The Monuments Men," How did Monuments Men ever get made?
","This is how.George Clooney reigns supreme in Hollywood.The screenwriter of this particular uneventful,unconvincing romp must have been a hell of a talker to get Clooney involved in the first place. But once ya got old Georgy hooked he's on board.And he probably got hooked on playing that same refined gentleman/hero that he is known and typecast for. Georgy Porgy just called up some of his buddies,like John Goodman and Bill Murray, that always love to to do a movie with good odd George. Therefor the mountain of Hollywood came to Mozes Clooney and decided that there should be light in this shallow universe of a story.A few billion dollars and some few months on set with the good old boys,later, we anticipate the ultimate buddy movie.The studios bombard us with suggestive trailers and publicity campaigns.Then we audiences get to see it and the dreadful die is cast,while the cast dies on screen.The plot is a haberdashery of genres that don't sit well with each other and therefor never come together in any sensible way.The dialog is stale and full of clich√©s.If you thought the dialog of the second Star Wars was bad, think again!The soundtrack gave new meaning to the words 'Where have I heard these tunes and marches before' and was omni-impotently present.The psychology of the characters null and void.We just did not give a damn about the rescue of art we should be giving a damn about.But if the writing is this shitty we all just wanna hit the fan in disbelief. And so the big machine called Hollywood wastes acting talent and a lot of money on the umpteenth Second world War story(Where's the Spanish Civil or First World War when you need them) that has nothing new on offer, but was sold to us as if it did have just that. And so a one track mind movie (rescue art from bad bad Nazis)becomes a zero picture.But I bet everybody did get paid in the end.All's well that sells star-studded sh....:) :)",1,0,0,7 October 2014
