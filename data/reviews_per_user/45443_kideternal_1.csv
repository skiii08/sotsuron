First Man," A Shameful Distortion
","The first half was okay, but then it devolved into a smear-piece to reframe mankind's greatest achievement as some sort of failure. Instead of elation, we get a somber snooze-fest. The screenplay writer and director should be dragged behind horses for such an egregious crime against humanity. (Seriously. What kind of agenda is at play here?) I was so filled with disgust I walked out of the theater, which is something I never do.",3,7,12,16 July 2019
