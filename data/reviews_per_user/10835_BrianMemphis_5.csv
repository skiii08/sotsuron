Frost_Nixon," Engaging and worth watching
","The film is framed by shots of TV cameras from Nixon's point of view - at the beginning the camera Nixon is resigning into and at the end the camera into which he apologizes. As one of the characters states, the movie is about the 'reductive power of television.' Nixon understands this, tries very hard to manipulate TV to his advantage, and fails. He's haunted by TV from his earliest debates to the very end. (Is the scene with the dog intended to further drive home this point by reminding the audience of the 'Checkers' speech?) A complete opposite approach from Nixon, Frost builds a career by embracing the shallowness of TV and is ultimately rewarded for it. Excellent performances all around, nice interplay between the two main characters over a pair of shoes. The movie is probably about as exciting as it possibly can be, despite the fact that it is about a TV interview. In the end, like an old western the main characters face each other alone, with even their support teams watching from separate rooms through the filter of television. Sure to attract and entertain US history buffs, the movie will inevitably be compared to 'All the President's Men' but should not be. Neither this movie nor the interviews have the same level of historical significance as the reporters uncovering the actual events. In other words, don't expect 'Frost/Nixon' to replace 'All the President's Men' in your high school history classroom anytime soon. A more apt comparison would be to the movie 'Quiz Show' - this movie feels like the 1970s in the same way 'Quiz Show' felt like the 1950s, and it attempts to add some depth to the dimensions of the characters we watch on TV. Another comparison that comes to mind is to the recent Richard Gere movie 'The Hoax' - Gere's character approaches and pushes his project with the same intensity as Frost in this film.",6,1,3,9 November 2009
Source Code," People are more than data elements
","Despite a failure to adequately adhere to or even define its own internal logic, Source Code is a very entertaining action thriller.If there is a message, it's about the consequences of losing touch with our humanity in the information age.This is evident when Goodwin's computer screens are finally revealed to the audience: while it's clear from the camera and microphone that Sgt. Coulter can actually hear and see Goodwin, Coulter's communications are shown only in scrolling text.Similary, our society remains plugged in to various databases, Web sites and other forms of computer 'source code' that form a cold impersonal representation of who we are.When Goodwin goes in to the room where Coulter's body is hooked up to the machines and sees him with her eyes, she is finally able to appreciate the situation from a perspective more human that not and therefore makes the 'Good Win' decision.",7,0,1,16 April 2011
The Expendables," The Key to this film is the AutoPilot Scene!
","It would be way too easy to write a snarky review tearing down this movie; other reviewers have that covered. In my opinion, the movie is at its best during Statham and Stallone's first trip to the island. It feels like we're in an 80s-action movie and the plot is still setting up. But then things go downhill rapidly.Digging deeper, for me the key to this whole movie is a scene on the way back to the island the second time. For no particular reason, a shot holds on Stallone switching on the plane's autopilot switch. This shot seems out of place, but upon further recollection it's is a metaphor for the whole movie. The Expendables is what happens when you throw all these action guys together and press autopilot.Pure speculation on my part here, but I imagine Stallone wanted to create an Oceans Eleven type experience and work with his friends. Not sure if he achieved what he wanted to, but the Expendables is no Oceans Eleven.",4,4,8,17 March 2011
Salt," Entertaining Action with Throwback Plot
","The movie's action sequences are very entertaining, and it's unique to see a woman in a Bourne-style action role. However, many elements of the plot are not unique, since the idea of the forgotten Soviet sleeper agent has been used many times before (Telefon, Little Nikita, etc). 80s flashback nostalgia is very appealing right now on US television (see Chuck, Fringe) and makes an audience-friendly way to tie the action together. Complaints about the plot aside, the suspense works and the actors do a fine job.Watching the endings of the two alternate versions provided on the DVD (extended version and director's version) really show how much a film can change with a few simple tweaks. The director's ending, with its voice over and the additional gunshot scene in the control room, raises the stakes higher for the characters. Makes me wonder what the process was - audience testing, etc they used to arrive at the theatrical ending.",Null,1,2,17 March 2011
The Social Network," The First Rule of Nerd Club Is....
","Right out of the gate, we are hit full force with nerdy West-Wing-style dialogue, and some of the most realistic descriptions of computer programming I have ever seen in a movie. Technically the movie is very well done. Every actor is really talented. Justin Timberlake plays up the sleaze really well.The only part that struck me as a little off was the 'crazy girlfriend' breakup scene. My initial reaction was there must be some deleted scenes that further developed the craziness, or maybe it was just a fact too juicy to leave out. But it's also an echo of a theme- she tried to get Ed's attention with the fire, he tried to get Mark's by closing the bank account. In the final scene, billionaire Mark is desperately trying to get a girl's attention, and even the exclusive club he's created can't help him.",7,0,0,8 October 2010
