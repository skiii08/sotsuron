Ford v Ferrari," Great acting doesn't save a poor script
","There is some really good acting from all the principals in this film, but the direction is slow and shoddy and the script itself calls for too many shots of people changing gears, cars moving around the track, etc. Equally disappointing is the failure to once mention the Corvette, the raison d'etra for the Mustang in the first place.",4,26,66,18 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Could not be any worse
","This film has almost no redeeming qualities. The plot is dull and boring. Really boring. The music is too loud and dramatizes every little thing. The photography spends about an hour with closeups of Gosling. How they could take a great film like Blade Runner and produce this garbage is beyond me. BTW - the 3-D version really has no 3-D visuals, so it's a rip off.",2,5,12,15 October 2017
Come and See," Culturally relevant
","To appreciate this film you probably need to be Russian or at least European. The first hour (that's all I could stand to watch) has no action (strange for a war film) and most of the time it has closeups of two teenagers making faces. There isn't much of a story either. Perhaps the film gets better, but who cares.",2,4,18,31 January 2020
Child 44," Atmospheric drama with twists and turns
","A dark and brooding tale about Soviet Russia circa 1953 with outstanding performances by Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, Fares Fares, and Joel Kinnaman. The direction is taut and the production values make you feel as if you are in Russia. Few films have conveyed the despair, depression, and paranoia of this era, yet the film itself is so much more. Fans of Tom Hardy (and who isn't) will find this film is another in a line of marvelous characters. Fans of Noomi Rapace will find her disappearing into the character while capturing the Russian persona to perfection.Among my favorite actors - Gary Oldman does a good job but he is only in a few scenes. Charles Dance similarly does a good job, but he has only one brief cameo at the end. And Vincent Cassel is ominous but also has only a few scenes.",10,80,154,25 April 2015
Rocketman," Words and music
","What seems to be forgotten in much of the talk about this film is that the words didn't come from Elton John but rather they came from his collaborator. Sometimes the songs are about Elton John as viewed by Bernie Taupin, and sometimes they are only about Taupin. Elton John put the words to music and he delivered them in a unique style, but the real 'personal' side to the music is Bernie Taupin, not Elton John.That being said, this film makes it very clear that the words and thoughts are from Taupin so it's a wonder that very little is revealed about Taupin.Putting aside the neglect for the song writer, the film itself has some wonderful performances and some wonderful moments. But the attempt to turn it into a musical, albeit understandable, failed for me. Some of the musical numbers are just plain silly. I think the film would have been better as a bio with lots of music and the occasional musical freelance scene. Less would be more for my tastes.",5,13,33,1 June 2019
Passengers," New Clark Gable
","Having seen him in a few films as well as the TV series 'Parks and Recreation' it's obvious to me that Chris Pratt is the 'new Clark Gable'. He has drop dead good looks, reasonably good acting skills, and can do comedy, drama, and action equally well. We really haven't had anyone with this combination at this level, and it's good to see.That being said, the current film certainly isn't a test of Pratt's skills, through no fault of his own. The script has few surprises and nothing really to recommend itself. Pratt and Lawrence do the requisite friends -> lovers scenes, but the film tends to be a little boring. That's peculiar because the film's director did 'The Imitation Game' (2014) and made a film about discovering computers exciting. The screenwriter, Jon Spaihts, penned the ultra boring 'Promotheus' (2012), so perhaps the blame goes to him.Wait for it on video. It's OK but hardly worth the price of a ticket nowadays",5,3,17,23 December 2016
The Irishman," unimaginable
","Out of respect for the fact that these people once made good, even great films, I sat through the entire unbearable mess. Terrible acting, painfull direction, and even a poor sound track done on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.",2,2,6,3 January 2020
Point Break," Disappointing
","Yes the action is far more exciting in this version and yes the photography is terrific, along with the music. But where it fails, and it does so very badly, is in the story, the acting, and especially the editingRecall the original - Patrick Swayze plays the surfer and Kenau Reeves is the quarterback, along with Gary Busey before he got into the motorcycle accident. Then there was fragile Lori Petty who played 'the girl'. All 4 of these actors did memorable jobs in the 1991 version, but here in 2015, only Ray Winstone adds a bit of showmanship.The current version instead of being US centric is Euro centric, which I guess someone figured out might make more money but doesn't make for a better film. The film's star and most of the cast were unknown to me, which isn't necessarily bad if they bring something to the table. I thought they didn't.But worst of all is the editing. What must have been incredible stunts are reduced to edited pieces so that the true nature of the stunt is never captured. By doing quick edits the story lacks the true impact of the stunts, and could have been done on a sound stage in some cases. Here is one film in which long takes would have been mandatory, but they are rare.",3,7,10,9 January 2016
Creed," 'It's not so bad...'
","Freud called it the repetition compulsion and for him it became the major drive, even surpassing the sex drive. It's the reason behind why children enjoy hearing the same tale over and over again , and it's how a story like this, though we know how it's going to evolve, can nonetheless be entertaining. There are no surprises here, but it is very well done which makes the familiar journey all the more enjoyable.Watching the film I am reminded of what a fine actor Sylvester Stallone can be. In the original 'Rocky', his performance (and those of his co-stars) were among the best of the later half of the 20th Century. He did it again with his first 'Rambo' film, putting in another great performance. As life would have it, they both became franchises, what were unique and compelling characters became caricatures, and in the end we yearned for them to stop because the authenticity was lost in the posturing.The current film does justice to the original, and brings us back to a place where we can contentedly look back and see the cycle come full circle. A great script, fine acting, and a good musical score help make this one to remember. I was a little disappointed in the fighting scenes, which do not do justice to the first 3 Rocky features, but otherwise it's a good film",8,3,6,27 November 2015
The Hateful Eight," Big big disappointment
","Quentin Tarantino surely must rate as one of the most dissipated directors of all time, and his latest piece of cr@p is called 'The Hateful Eight'. No it's not as bad as Django, Grindhouse, or Jackie Brown, but from a man who gave us 'Pulp Fiction', 'Reservoir Dogs', and 'Kill Bill' this is a big big disappointment. Tararntino's best work is now more than 2 decades old, and the only half decent film he's made in the last decade was 'Inglorious Basterds' (2009).The film itself is far too long and too much in love with itself, as are the actors who in other films can be quite engaging. Tarantino trots old his old band of reliables (Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Samuel Jackson) but even they go down under the weight of the script and self-conscious direction.",2,94,197,26 December 2015
The Book Thief," WW 2 from a child's perspective
","Those familiar with the 2005 award winning and best-selling novel by Australian author Markus Zusak will not be disappointed with the theatrical version which differs from the book in only minor details. Both tell the story of a preadolescent girl who is adopted into a German family living in a small village in 1938, and then by following her life we get to view war on the home front for Germany. Nazi rallies, anti-Jewish pogroms, Hitler Youth groups, conscription, book burning, daylight bombing, propaganda films and posters, and the whole gamut of events are seen from her perspective.This isn't the first film to adopt this perspective. 'The Diary of Anne Frank' is the classic example, but more recently, 'No Place on Earth' (2013) covered some of the same ground as did 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' (2008) and especially 'Lore' (2012).'The Book Thief' has wonderful photography by Florian Ballhaus, an excellent musical score by Golden Globe and Oscar winning John Williams ('Schindler's List', 'ET', 'Star Wars'), and best of all, marvelous acting from Sophie Nelisse as the young girl, Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson as her adoptive parents, and Ben Schnetzer as the Jewish boy they hide. Many of the core scenes with Nelisse, Watson, and Rush should be required viewing at any acting school.Hats off too to young Nico Liersch who plays a boyhood friend of Nelisse.If the film has any fault at all, it is the decision by the film makers to try to walk a fine line between drama and fable. Having 'Death' as the narrator right from the start seems to suggest fable, but the story itself veers sharply to drama for most of the 2+ hours, and then, noticeably at the end, reverts to fable. Some viewers may find this disconcerting. But the power of the story and the acting generally compensate for this short coming.",9,153,184,16 November 2013
Black Mass," Long and boring
","'Long and boring' are the first words that come to mind when exiting from this film, which seems strange because a gangster film which is boring is almost a contrast in words. Off-hand I can't think of another gangster film that had less action, suspense, or drama. Apart from the length and direction, the musical score is almost non-existent, which in a film of this nature trying to recapture bygone days, is a cardinal sin.Perhaps the worst feature of the film, though, is the acting, from Johnny Depp's poor imitation of Jack Nicholson to the Irish accents that come and go throughout the film. It's not all bad acting. For me, David Harbour ('End of Watch'), Dakota Johnson ('The Social Network') and Juno Temple ('Magic, Magic') stood out.This is a film you can surely miss.",3,22,43,19 September 2015
Suicide Squad," Suicidal
","You really have to go out of your way to make a picture this bad. Incomprehensible logic, poor character studies, bad acting, and tacky makeup are only some of the problems with this film. The music accompanying the film is pretty good, but doesn't necessarily match the plot, and in any event, it's far too loud.The special effects aren't bad. In fact, they are the best part of the film, although some of them are pretty tacky, but in a film so bad, even these special effects are a treat.Don't waste your time on this one. Even the recent poor films like Batman vs Superman are far superior to this one.",2,3,8,5 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," 'Not with a bang but with a whimper'
","This is the way the series ends, not with a bang but a whimper. Apologies to TS Eliot (The Hollow Men). What a big let down. Overly noisy cgi, a confused plot, weak characters, and cameos from everyone but Jar Jar Binks. Looking back, they never should have done anything after the first one, maybe the first three.FWIW - on it's own the film is probably a 3+. But as the final episode in an iconic 9 part series, what a downer.",2,36,61,21 December 2019
Pacific Rim," Great Special Effects But Little Else
","The problem with special effects films is that the special effects tend to dominate the story and the character development, but at the end of the day, it is story and character which make a film memorable. 'Pacific Rim' is a classic case – great special effects overshadow a poorly developed story line and even weaker characters. One of the core problems in the film is that the main actor, Charlie Hunnam, who does such a great job on the TV series 'Sons of Anarchy', just doesn't translate well to the big screen. It's not an uncommon problem (think David Caruso). His co-star, Rinko Kikuchi, seems completely lost, and most of the other characters don't have enough screen time for us to care one way or the other. Idris Elba, who usually turns in a good performance, can barely be understood, and Max Martini ('The Unit', 'Redbelt'), another fine actor, seems to be sleepwalking.The comic relief, provided by Charlie Day, Ron Perlman, and Burn Gorman, are more ludicrous than funny.OTOH, the film does have some really impressive special effects, except for the ending, which appears to be shot in the pool of Director Guillermo del Toro. Del Toro directed the 'Hell boy' (2004, 2008) films, which probably accounts for Ron Perlman's brief cameo. His best work has been 'Pam's Labyrinth' (2006) which wasn't exactly an action adventure film, and his penchant for sci-fi and insect-like creatures can be seen as far back as 'Mimic' (1997) which isn't remembered as a classic. Nonetheless he does a good job with the special effect sequences and they will keep you on the edge of the seat.",6,6,15,13 July 2013
The Lost City of Z," Should have stayed lost
","It's hard to imagine how this film could be any worse. Let's start with the acting. Charlie Hunnam was great as a m/c thug, but he clearly isn't suited to play a British gentleman at the turn of the 20th Century. His accent comes and goes, but it's his non-verbal behavior that betrays the 21st Century. His co-star Sienna Miller (playing his wife) is wonderful, but the film is almost exclusively HunnamThen there is the directing. The film fails to give us any feeling for the enormous undertakings, the claustrophobia of the jungle, and the hardships of the journey. Just about the time you might get a sense of it, the director cuts away. Weeks are conveyed in seconds, and years in minutes. You couldn't do a worse job with actually trying.The editing is a problem too. Edit by symbol undisguised is a first year film school trick and doesn't belong on the big screen.I stayed for the entire film, hoping somehow they would do something to salvage the film. They didn't.",2,37,66,28 April 2017
The Revenant," Long boring and gruesome
","Here's a film that has almost no redeeming qualities. It spends much too much time with 'in your face' symbolism or dwelling on gruesome pictures of wounds, dead carcases, bleeding sores, etc. There is one mishap after another, which might make for great reading but which makes for a boring film. After all, this isn't survivorman, and even that is better than this. Really, How many ways can Leonardo get hurt? Shot, stabbed, fall off a mountain, get hit in the head,... OH, and did I mentioned, get mauled by a bear.Now imagine Leonardo in a fight with Tom Hardy? What are the chances that Leonardo, on the best day of his life, could take Hardy, on the worst day of his life? What a big disappointment. If you want a good film about trappers, try Jeremiah Johnson or Centennial. This film is a big big loser.",2,14,29,9 January 2016
The Battle of Algiers," Photography yes, Character development no.
","The film has some of the finest photography anywhere, making it look like a documentary instead of a film. But where it break down is in the character development.There is no one to whom we can feel much of a connection, partly because the film virtually follows no one and what we do get are mere sketches of people.",7,1,2,7 July 2019
Dunkirk," Unworthy
","Clumsy editing, poor character development, and a lack of historical basis make this one of the worst war films to come along in recent years.What WW2 films did I like best? In no particular order - The Longest Day, a Bridge too far, A Walk in the Sun, Hell in the Pacific, The Great Escape, Saving Private Ryan, Bridge over the River Kwai, Attack, Hangmen Also Die, The Dirty Dozen, Kanal, Das Boot, Run Silent Run Deep, etc.",3,23,43,21 July 2017
Dallas Buyers Club," Great acting in a story that needed to be told
","Marvelous acting and an interesting story help compensate for an over long film that fades at the end. But lay aside the ending and bring a cup of coffee to help you through some of the slow moments, because you will be treated to some of the best acting of this year or any year. I've never been a fan of Matthew McConaughey but here he gives us his A game and his A game is equal to anyone's. It's not merely that he underwent dramatic physical changes, it's his emotional tone which is so on target. This is his career best and quite remarkable.But he's not the only game in town. Jared Leto clearly comes into his own with this film, well beyond his previous work. And Jennifer Garner's brief role provides one of her best performances since she left 'Alias'.The film is not only worthwhile for the bravura acting, it's also a very interesting look at the politics behind big Pharma, and the collusion between physicians, drug companies, and the government. This was a sad chapter in American health care, and though it is a subplot in the larger film, it is overdue for some scrutiny.",8,6,11,13 November 2013
Legend," Boring beyond belief
","The only thing legendary about this film is the boredom it creates. Marketed as a 'gangster' film, the film falls way short of the mark. Instead it dwells on the mental instability of one of the brothers and the ill-fated love life of the other brother. The film disappoints on all 3 levels – it is not a satisfactory gangster film, nor a very compelling love story, nor will it give you much insight into mental illness.In some respects even more disappointing is the inability of the film to give us a feeling for London in the 60s.On a positive note I think the acting was pretty good. I say 'think' because I didn't understand most of the dialogue, which was actually one of the few charming aspects of the film.",2,46,85,12 December 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon a Time Tarantino Could Make a Movie
","This isn't a bad movie because it isn't a movie at all. It's collection of scenes, most of them boring and overly long, stitched together, trying desperately to represent LA, and more particularly Hollywood, in the late 60s. I endured it for 2 hours and then left. I guess it eventually ends, buti by the time I left I really didn't care. And I was by no means the first to leave the show. Smarter people started leaving after about 30 minutes. I stayed. I thought 'Tarantino:' - wrong! I thought - 'Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio' - wrong! I thought 'Charlie Manson from a new angle' - wrong! I thought 'Al Pacino, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern' - wrong! What a total waste of time and talent.",2,26,54,28 July 2019
Pawn Sacrifice," Very Disappointing
","The story of Bobby Fischer is a fascinating one, with personal as well as global implications, and it occurred at one of the most interesting times in recent history. How then could you go wrong?Start with a superficial biography of Fischer, especially his early years. Try to give us no clues as to how his obsessive disorder developed, or how his paranoia slowly took over his persona. By doing that you leave us adrift, simply observers watching a 'crazy' man do all kinds of self-defeating things.Then ignore the game of chess. Treat it like it was any other competition. Don't delve into the intricacies of the game - its demands - the strategies that people develop - their characteristic approaches to the game. Just give us close ups of chess pieces and people thinking. That will surely dull us to sleep.Now ignore the other central character in the drama so there is no one to root for. Not the crazy man nor the strong silent one.This is a tragic waste of talent and a sad attempt to tell a truly fascinating story.",6,11,23,26 September 2015
Hidden Figures," You had to be there
","It's hard to recreate the early 60s on film since there was so much going on. Society was changing, we were moving from Eisenhower to Kennedy not only in style but in POV, sex and drugs were in your face, beatniks had turned into hippies, Frank Sinatra was out and Bob Dylan was in, civil rights was as much a concern in the North as in the South, freedom rides and the Peace Corps took up the time of college kids, women were redefining their roles, and we lived with the threat of nuclear war. How do you capture all of that? You don't. And this film doesn't either. but it does capture some of the angst for women and for 'colored' people, and especially for 'colored' women.Set against the space race, the film focuses on the lives of 3 women, inside NASA and in their private lives. The acting is terrific from everyone, but the photography is pretty pedestrian, especially the constant framing in doorways. The music is also disappointing, especially for an era in which music was ascending in importance.Leaving aside the film's shortcomings, the story itself is of major importance and a valuable addition to other films about the space race.",9,13,46,6 January 2017
1917," Sacrifice story for technique
","The desire to make one long endless tracking shot seriously interrupts the story. For example, when the soldiers are crossing through corpse strewn battlefields we get only a brief glimpse of the carnage. A pause to consider the broken body parts would help serve the story, but instead we get only a peripheral look.",3,6,19,17 January 2020
Sicario," Ordinary
","Sicario is about as ordinary a thriller as you can make without going too wrong. The acting is generally good and the photography is beautiful. Where the film goes wrong is in two places. (1) The direction fails to take advantage of two situations in which enormous tension could have been built and built - the scene on the line waiting to cross the border and the scene in the tunnel. Instead of being masterpieces, these scenes are merely OK. The setups are excellent, but the execution is merely ordinary. (2) The character played by Blunt is not true to herself, in the end, yet there is no real compelling reason to explain the transition. Films where the protagonist changes as a result of some fundamental reckoning are great, but in this case, it doesn't hold up for me. This is why the film ends as it does, because there is nothing to sustain the ending around the main character.All in all not a bad film, but highly predictable, not very subtle, and nothing you haven't seen already.",5,16,32,26 September 2015
Joker," Not your father's 'Joker'
","If you are a Batman fan and want to see a film in the Batman genre, this is not your film. The film plays with characters and timelines to such an extent it is unrecognizable as a Batman film. If you can put that aside, you may finds the movie entertaining.On a positive side, the film is very original. very inventive, and quite charming in places. The acting from Phoenix is exceptional, though it's questionable if he should have lost all that weight to the extent that he appears deformed. Nothing in the script implies physical deformity.The film is also excessively violent and it's the kind of violence that isn't comic book style, but rather real-life. Will this inspire? Is it really necessary to put aside the comic book violence of most comic book films and go for something more street level?Phoenix's descent into madness is wonderful. One of the best I've seen on the screen. The hallucinations that are all too real are very well done. Tweaked and re-titled, this might have been a wonderful and valuable film about mental illness.I gave it a 5. In some respects (inventive, clever, wonderful acting) it is a 10. In other respects (too violent, a few plot flaws, the weight loss, using Joker but throwing away almost everything we know), it is a disappointment.",5,5,21,5 October 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," Delightful spoof of 50s Hollywood
","This is a delightful spoof of Hollywood movie making in the 50s with terrific acting and wonderful production numbers re-creating the works of Gene Kelly, Esther Williams, Audie Murphy, etc. There are small gems littered throughout the film, with Frances McDormand as a film editor, Ralph Fiennes trying to teach Alden Ehrenreich how to act, Jonah Hill as a 'certified person', and a motley crew of Communist writers (David Krumholtz, Max Baker, John Bluthal, Fisher Stevens, Patrick Fischler) trying to explain Das Kapitol to George Clooney.Unfortunately the film's climax is a bit disappointing, and there are some elements (e.g., the confessions, the Lockeed recruitment) that didn't really work for me. But on the whole it was perfectly delightful.Anyone who enjoys films will find a lot to enjoy here.",8,4,14,5 February 2016
The Reader," Wonderful acting and story, bad editing
","Had this film been edited at a higher standard it would be one of the best films ever. Instead it's a good film, but only because the editing don't really connect the emotional reality of the story (with the exception of one scene when the lawyer looks out the window at a passing train and sees himself 20 years earlier). I'm reminded of the 2 versions of 'Once Upon a Time in America'. The one that is so remarkable is the one where the editing is superb, and the other version is OK. That 's what happened here. I wish someone would go back and re-edit the film. That being said, it certainly is a good film as it stands and everything else about it was wonderful.",7,0,0,15 December 2019
Kong: Skull Island," EcoWarrior theme falls a bit flat
","Why on earth would you want to remake the 1933 classic King Kong? It came out during the Golden years of Hollywood Horror, with such films as Frankenstein (1931), Dracula (1931), Dr. Jekly & Mr. Hyde (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), etc. To this date those classics (mostly from Universal) remain the best of breed. Attempts to re-make the classic Kong in 1976 (Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange) and 2005 Jack Black, Naomi Watts) both failed. In the original, the cast (Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong), the director (Merian Cooper), producer (David O Selznick) and the animation (Willis O'Brian) are all first rate. (FWIW – Willis was the mentor to Ray Harryhausen who is perhaps even better known for his work on stop-action animation) Kong has been in several other films, mostly Japanese including King Kong vs Godzilla (1962) and King Kong Escapes (1967). There was even a 'Son of Kong' released just a few months after the original, re- starring Robert Armstrong but absent Fay Wray. The current film has a large cast (Samuel Jacklson, John Goodman, John C Riley, Tom Hiddleston).Uniformly they do a good job, especially Riley and Jackson. The director is virtually unknown but the writer Dan Gilroy has done some good projects like Real Steel (2011), The Bourne Legacy (2012) and Nightcrawler (2014). Photography is excellent.This 2017 version is clearly superior to the other versions, except for the original. The anti-war ecology theme is a bit heavy handed, but the real problem is the 'monsters' who are done very poorly, and even Kong gives us very little more than the 1933 version did. In fact, I'm going to say, even less. Also, we're missing the romance.",5,4,10,10 March 2017
Arrival," Lyrical
","Ostensibly this is a film about an alien arrival. Is it an invasion ('Independence Day') or are they friendly ('Day the Earth Stood Still')? Will they be perceived as friendly or will we assume they are aggressive? That's what you think you are going to see, but it isn't. Not really. Instead you will get a treat, one you don't expect and one that sneaks up on you bit by bit.The script is excellent and the concept behind the script is even better. The photography and the music are marvelous, as is the editing that hints are the story's resolution.The only thing I could quarrel with is the makeup for Amy Adams - she doesn't appear to age even though the story takes place over a number of years. Otherwise this would be a 10",9,3,11,11 November 2016
Jojo Rabbit," SNL Skit
","The film would have been a great SNL skit, but as a film it leaves a lot to be desired. I'll admit that it's hard to get laughs from the Nazis, Hogan's Heroes not withstanding. But it's not merely the juvenile humor that doesn't light the spark, it's the constant lapsing of accents, the modern idioms, and the kid's forgetting that he limps. I left after half an hour so maybe I'm wrong and maybe somehow the film got better.",2,36,98,18 November 2019
Lucy," Besson evolves
","I'm a big fan of Luc Besson as a writer-director ('Leon', 'The Fifth Element', 'Angel-A', 'La Femme Nikita') and he normally restricts himself to action with a good dose of violence, and only the occasional philosophical hints. In his best films, the focus is often on a young woman who is aided by an older man, and he is true to his methods in this film, although he adds a significant layer of philosophy and epistemology. Some may find this distracting, and for some it may be above their comprehension, but for me it was marvelous, to the point where I actually could have used fewer car chases and a little less violence.Here is an intelligent script with wonderful photography and music, and a sly use of canned footage that will amuse you. Morgan Freeman is his usual awesome self, and Min-sik Choi ('Old Boy') is appropriately menacing.Go see this film, but don't expect the normal Besson film. That's good. Perhaps Besson is evolving just as Lucy evolves.",9,6,23,29 July 2014
Midway," cgi vs character
","Here is another example of the emphasis on cgi over character development. The cgi effects in this film are great. You really get the feeling of being a dive bomber pilot. It would make a great video game. But not a movie. The character development is really sparse. What's even worse, some of the major issues surrounding the battle are neglected. The change in the Navy from ships to planes was a major struggle at the time. It's never mentioned. Torpedo planes were a new technology and very controversial. Barely a mention. The discord in Washington between the European and the Pacific emphasis is never mentioned, nor even alluded to. The discord within the Japanese is the only thread given attention.",3,2,7,15 November 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Part comic, part video game
","When it isn't using dialogue and concepts from comic books, Chapter 2 turns into a video game with people being dispatched by bomb, pencil, knife, handgun, machine gun, auto, etc. But there are some lessons to be learned -Apparently you can be struck by a car going 30-40 miles and hour and merely bounce off.Apparently the entire City of New York is inhabited by assassins and spies, who pretend to be homeless, street performers, maintenance men, garage workers, etc.It's not completely terrible. Always good to see Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, John Leguizamo, Lance Reddick, and Franco Nero.The first John Wick was much better.",3,18,48,10 February 2017
The Nice Guys," Not so nice
","The people who created the coming attractions for this film deserve an Oscar. They made me believe it was going to be a great buddy drama, something akin to 'Bad Boys' or 'The Last Boy Scout' (of which this is a strange clone). Instead it is a mindless waste of talent with virtually nothing to recommend it.The acting is only slightly better than bad. And there is no chemistry at all between any of the main characters - a grave sin in a buddy film.The film takes place in 1977 but there is almost nothing to evoke the era. Neither the music, dress, locations, or slang bring us back to that era.Then there's the plot, or lack of it. I won't reveal it here, but you wouldn't believe it if I did.Don't waste your time or money. If you've seen the coming attractions you've already seen the only worthwhile scenes in the film.",2,32,70,20 May 2016
