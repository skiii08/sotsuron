Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Absolutely amazing. Ignore the reviews.
","After attending the midnight showing of 'Star Wars: Episode I' this past night, I must admit that I do not understand where the critics are drawing their reviews from.  'Episode I' is a fantastic movie, which will reward fans and newcomers alike, and excels in the most important aspect of such a film: moviemaking.  Absolutely breathtaking - the first time you see Coruscant at night or the cities of the Gungans, you'll just say, 'Wow.' The climax is one of the most amazing moments in movies I have ever seen, with FOUR different good vs. evil situations taking place at THE SAME TIME. Kind of like the Endor battle scenes, but on crack.The movie is wonderfully composited, and there are moments of extreme tension in the directing - whoever says that Lucas didn't slow down obviously didn't pay very close attention!Ignore the hype, and ignore the lackluster reviews.  Sit down, grab a cup of something to drink, relax, and watch as the title rolls up the screen and the moment that most people have been waiting almost 20 years for grips you and takes you along for the ride.Fantasic.  GO SEE IT.",9,0,0,19 May 1999
