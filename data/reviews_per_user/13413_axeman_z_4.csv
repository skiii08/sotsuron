Blade Runner 2049," Unusual in a good way
","To me this movie represents something of an oddity. This movie is one of those rare sequels that make the original worth watching. I'd seen the original at the pleading of fans my age who wouldn't shut up about it being this great sci-fi masterpiece of a movie. It most certainly was not that and anybody that tries to convince you otherwise is an obsessed individual. The sequel however is a sci-fi masterpiece, the catch is you really do need to watch the original as it is full of callbacks to it. Thankfully you can watch the movies in any order and still have the same outcome of an experience, overall good. The movie shines with the excellent acting, above average writing, and astounding visuals & sound. Can you watch this movie and appreciate it having not seen the original, yes. Would watching the original make this an easier to understand film, absolutely.",9,3,12,26 March 2020
John Wick," Don't Believe the Hype
","How can I describe the movie John Wick in comparison to other action films, average at best, more mediocre than average. This movie starts of very strong, with a plot that seems like it is about to elevate this movie into something more than just another action flick. It almost looks like it will delve into that rarely seen realm of an action flick with a decent story. Then it gets about halfway through and becomes so very predictable and rather boring. I rarely use the word boring even describing average to mediocre action films but that is exactly what happens to this movie about halfway through. How can a movie full of action be boring is something the people who made this film should ponder. I cannot really blame the cast as they all were pretty good in their roles, the story was just straight booty after the halfway point. This is a prime example of a movie that should have ended like 40 minutes prior to when it did. When the main character achieved his goal is when it should have ended but the just had to add on another 40- 60 minutes of movie which just made everything up to that point seem like a wasted effort. Shame on the writers, directors, financiers, and all the behind the scenes magic that made this movie for not realizing this movie was headed into the absurd realm sooner. You would be better suited spending your cash on almost ANY other movie at the box office this weekend if you insist on seeing this film. The saddest part of this is that Keanu Reeves (and all the cast) actually did some pretty good acting in this film, not his usual phoning it in. Anybody who says this movie is more than a below average action movie is not somebody who has seen the movie or a person with poor film taste.",6,9,32,24 October 2014
Saw III," Worth every penny...
","For anybody that has ever had anything bad to say about the SAW movie franchise, this movie should shut them up. It was a masterpiece from beginning to end. Dare I say that the fans of this series will have a harder time enjoying the movie because of what they have come to expect from Jigsaw. Rest assured for all you loyal fans, just get through the first 20 minutes with an open mind, and I promise it will come to you his plot as the first few scenes seem very unlike his previous works. This movie ties up any and all loose ends concerning the series previous movies and brings a finality to the series that not even Spielberg, Lucas, Craven and Cameron put together could revive. The only way this series could breath again, even 10 years from now woud be if they went even further into his previous work as we can all be completely sure about the fate of Jigsaw from this movie. And to think, this continuation of the series is truly, unlike a lot of movie, quite literally a continuation of the series from part one through its current release. You will not be disappointed. And a word to the weak stomached people, you may wanna save your theater treats for after the first 30 minutes of the film or you may end up wearing what you just ate.",10,2,5,31 October 2006
The Departed," Oscar worth until...
","...Until that is it turned into a retarded Jerry Springer episode. I mean, through the entire move the plot was excellent, the acting superb, the movie just breath-takingly good until the last 20 minutes or so. Then, for no really apparent reason, it turned into a Loony Tons episode and like six people get killed. Now mind you, throughout the entire movie we only see one or two deaths, and it is a long movie, and several other deaths were implied. But in the end, it turns into a three ring circus with people just getting shot in the head for no apparent reason. I understand this movie was based on a book but come on, take a little creative liberty with it like most directors do with good source material. Now let me say some positive things about the movie. The cast was stellar, all involved parties gave one of their best or their best performances ever. And this next comment goes to all the haters of Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg, I have been telling you all for years that their acting skills were awesome and this movie proves it. Shame on some of you for not liking some of their early works. In the end, this movie goes from excellent dark, sometimes funny thriller, to just plain silly. This is one movie I would recommend seeing at theaters only if you are a die hard fan of the director. and love horrible endings that last for nearly a half an hour. For anybody else thats more intelligent, wait for the DVD your friend buys then borrow it or rent it from Netflix and form your own opinion as you will be very upset after having sat through that entire great movie for such a crappy ending.",6,6,12,7 October 2006
