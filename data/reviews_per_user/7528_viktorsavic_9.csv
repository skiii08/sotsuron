Joker," I kinda liked it

It Chapter Two," Bad beginning and so long duration
","I really don't don't like showing homosexuality in first 10 minutes and this movie takes too long... In every case first chapter is better.
Better story and takes much less time but it leaves better impression than this chapter. This time everything is kind of overkill. IT loses a point.
7 stars only because I was really looking forward to watch this second chapter cause first chapter impressed me so much.",7,1,4,6 September 2019
