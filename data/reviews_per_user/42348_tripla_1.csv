Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Overrated
","I finally saw Episode I.....and I'm afraid to say, it's NOT the best movie of all time.  I have always been a Star Wars fan and believe me, I really wish I could say it is, but it's not; in fact it's not even the best Star Wars movie (That title goes to Empire).  The special effects and battle scenes are the best I've ever seen, but the movie doesn't elicit the same awe and wonder that the others did.  Lucas didn't put very much thought and effort into the story; the whole plot was basically about a trade dispute, and it didn't seem like there was as much at stake as in the earlier films. The actors don't get much of a chance to develop their characters, which is part of what made the first three movies so enjoyable.  Jar Jar Binks has got to be the most annoying one in all 4 films, I mean I really hated him. You can tell Lucas put him in there for the kiddie appeal.I'd have to say the critics are partially right in their assessment of Episode I, but it's not a total bomb and I'm not saying don't bother seeing it.  It's still somewhat entertaining and that's good enough reason to go see it, which is why I rated it 7/10.",7,0,1,20 May 1999
