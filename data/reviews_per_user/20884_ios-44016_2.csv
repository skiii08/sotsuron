Blade Runner 2049," Denis Villeneuve Joins The Rest Of Hollywood Hacks
","Spoilers ahead!My advice is the opposite of most positive reviewers here. See this on the small screen at home.If you are a new viewer: not much is resolved in this film and it is therefore not useful to pay $15 to watch this in a cinema. There is subplot around an evil corporation and its megalomaniac CEO. There is another around a revolution. There is a mystery around somehow replicants have started breeding and giving birth. None of them is resolved. In fact, all this film does is kill a goon for the bad guys! If you are an old Blade Runner fan: skip this sequel. It is the worst sequel since The Force Awakens (granted that was a remake) and joins the likes of Mission impossible and the monthly Marvel abortion in establishing a 'need' for an annual crappy sequel. The new questions created are rubbish, as is the music and the dialogue. The lines, in particular, are inane. Q: is the dog real? A: I don't know. Ask it.There is some impressively massive sets and effects here and definitely beautiful women so it is not possible to give this a 1, but otherwise my review says it all.",3,12,23,15 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Cynical Remake They Call A Sequel
","This film was awful. It is just a cash cow to add to the monthly Marvel release schedule of Disney.The Disney princess has super powers, but is not attractive in any way (OK granted it is not as bad as Spy or Ghostbusters).There is Darth Vader clone who throws temper tantrums and takes his mask off every five minutes. Why have it? Either Disney needs to sell merchandise or the movie is cheap and the angry emo kid can't breathe.Then there is the Disney princess' love interest who is a janitor, but part of the vanguard of troops (the first order is environmentally conscious and cleans after itself?).Jarringly bad and stupid.",1,24,94,15 October 2017
