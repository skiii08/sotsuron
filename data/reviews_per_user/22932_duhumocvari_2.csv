Kill Bill: Vol. 2," excellent
","Of the original 'Kill Bill,' I wrote: 'The movie is all storytelling and no story. The motivations have no psychological depth or resonance, but are simply plot markers. The characters consist of their characteristics.' True, but one of the achievements of 'Vol. 2' is that the story is filled in, the characters are developed, and they do begin to resonate, especially during the extraordinary final meeting between The Bride and Bill Â— which consists not of nonstop action but of more hypnotic dialogue and ends in an event that is like a quiet, deadly punch line.Put the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it. I confess I feared that 'Vol. 2' would be like those sequels that lack the intensity of the original.",10,2,4,4 February 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," perfect
","Kill Bill... what can i say. This movie is absolutely brilliant. Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors. He can seriously compare with Spieldberg. He makes bloody and great movies. And Uma Thurman as the bride, she is just perfect for this roll. She wrote the script to. They just couldn't choose anyone else. And everyone else like David Carradine as Bill. I heard that he wasn't Quentins first actor for this movie. And that's bull****. The story, the plot, the script, the whole entire movie is perfect. I wonder that it wasn't a favorite for the Oscars. Since the moment i watched this movie 3 years ago i can still watch it a 100 times and it will be interesting.",10,1,5,6 January 2007
