The Perks of Being a Wallflower," where is the drama?
","This should be a drama about young people lost in loneliness, their roles as outsiders & how they handle their difficult situation. But it turns out that the movie is actually about some spoiled kids born into wealth, feeling absolutely confident & comfortable in their dandy-role, doing cool stuff all the time, partying hard & even win the hearts of the ones they want to. I expected a little bit more than a 90min story without ANY problems & aggravated circumstances. The story has no climax & no turning point at all which makes it absolutely redundant telling it in movie-length. you might get bored after 30min, expecting a sweeping change in their lives & relationships but you are definitely disappointed after 90min when nothing of that happened. I have to ask: where is the drama & why these kids have no problems to speak about? American drama? American irrelevance.",1,36,79,28 February 2013
