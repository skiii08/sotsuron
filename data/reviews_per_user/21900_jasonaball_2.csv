Hereditary," Thank you
","I watched his movie in theaters, and it felt like an eternity, in the best of ways. I started completely oblivious of this movie and was full blow sucker punched in the face. I sat jaw dropped for most of this movie, just by the family drama alone. Then add in death, grief and it just sucked away the room. Then the horror sets in. And just grows. I sat in a nearly empty theatre and by the time it started to get weird and strange, people in my near empty theater, began to walk out. I couldn't wrap my head around their leaving. In my opinion the movie just started. By the end, it sinks in.",9,1,3,28 May 2020
Midsommar," Pugh is brilliant
","This. This was amazing. Not one second went by where I wasn't looking at the screen. Florence Pugh is brilliant. She made me feel every single emotion she portrayed. This was my favorite movie of 2019, along with Parasite.",10,2,9,28 May 2020
