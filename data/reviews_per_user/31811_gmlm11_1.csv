The Monuments Men," Reminds me of the Train
","The plot is similar to Burt Lancaster's The Train, done in the early 70's. The major difference is that in The Train, it was French Nationals trying to save their national art collection that was being stolen by the Nazi's near the end of the war. Trains were used to transport the valuable art to Germany. The French showed ingenious tricks to fool the Germans . It was a very well done movie and Burt Lancaster showed his greatness as a true movie star. This mess Americanized the French which made it very unrealistic and dishonest. The All Star cast with poor script, and equally poor dialog, must have been a big financial incentive for the casting associate, because no one including Cate Blanchett earned there salary. It was a very disappointing performance by George Clooney. I will think twice before a see another movie with George Clooney in it.",1,27,38,18 March 2014
