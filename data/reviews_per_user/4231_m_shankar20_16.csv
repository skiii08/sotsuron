Frost_Nixon," The Story of a Confession
","I'm not sure how America looks at Nixon now. I was not aware that Nixon confessed to his countrymen in his interview to Frost. Confession does not undo the wrongs but is still indicative of integrity, or at least leftover integrity, especially when coming from men of highest offices. I say this because my own country has such a long list of scandals, scams, corruption and moral impropriety from politicians and bureaucrats, that it's people have grown almost immune. And, nobody expects that anybody will ever confess anything, even if convicted. At least I don't remember any. The closing scenes of Frost/Nixon show the courage it takes for Nixon to confess and how it drains him completely at the end. But at least, coming out of the interview, I guess, he would have been at last at peace with himself.Frost/Nixon is a part fictional and part factual intense drama. It is told primarily from Frost's angle. More time is spent on showing us his background, preparation and events. That may have been because there is already so much said about Nixon, this film too spending time on him would not have added anything new. As a result, the film is also about how his interview with Nixon catapults Frost into the big league.Ron Howard is a great director. He, assisted by his editor, brings in pace and drama to the film. He uses documentary-style participant interviews placed throughout the film. These characters look back at the events leading up to the interview and the interview itself and comment. They provide the footnotes to the main content.The film hinges on solid performances from Frank Langella and Michael Sheen. Langella brings out so many facets of Nixon's character. We see varieties of Nixon's confidence - ingrained, faked and lost. He is cool, impulsive, outraged, frustrated, calculative and manipulative. Langella lives his character. Sheen brings in a strange mix of cockiness and uncertainty to the role of Frost.Not to be missed.",7,1,4,24 March 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny ! Crazy !! Wild !!!
","Borat is a brilliantly funny film, one of the funniest I have seen in a long time. Sacha Baron Cohen carries it singularly on his shoulders with exceptional ease.It is said that most of the sequences in the film are real gags played out on real people at real places. I can only describe as amazing the end result that has come out of such experimental film-making. It takes imagination, conviction and courage to do something like that. The film does look like a series of gags but that does not take away its charm.There are many obvious ethical questions that can be raised on the film. The questions will make for interesting debate. But such a debate will be surely one-sided in Kazakhistan. However, I see Borat more as a film making fun of an average American's intelligence and awareness rather than of the Kazakhistani people or their culture.A must watch.",7,0,0,5 December 2008
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Getting dated with time
","The euphoria that Raiders of the Lost Ark created at the time it was released is well known. A lot of people claim that it has influenced many film-makers over the years who made action-adventure films. But I think that Raiders of the Lost Ark is not placed in context most of the times. The truth is, this film did not invent the action-adventure genre. Now, with special effects tools becoming more advanced by the day, the action-adventure films are more spectacular than ever before. So where does all this leave Raiders? The answer to this question may differ with people.To the many who saw Raiders when they were young, I guess it is to them what Jurassic Park (I saw it when I was 14) is to me. It is probably the most fun they ever had watching a film. But that's it. Raiders of the Lost Ark is nothing more than that - a fun film, which now looks dated. It is one of those 'American Classics' that I fail to understand the hype about.Spielberg can mold a film like clay. He can and has created edge-of-the-seat films. But sometimes I wonder that when all those people, who saw his films when they first came out, go away and are not there to talk about it, will the next generations still find his films so thrilling? The action-adventure genre is like alcohol, you want it more potent with time. There lies the biggest threat for all action-adventure films; even if it is from Spielberg.I liked Kingdom of the Crystal Skull more than Raiders of the Lost Ark.",6,0,6,2 July 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Pure Fun - No Secret Ingredient
","Kung Fu Panda is pure unadulterated fun. At the center of it is a very likable Panda. He dreams of being a kung fu warrior while working along side his father as a noodles cook. Unknown to him, it is his destiny to be a great kung fu warrior, defeat another evil warrior and bring peace to his town and master.Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman lend their voices to the film and bring their characters alive. The Panda, in fact feels very much like what Jack Black is in most of his films - a chubby underdog. At the root of it, of course, Kung Fu Panda emphasizes on the simple principles of believing in oneself and victory of good over evil - like all fables and fairy tales.The animation is high quality and very detailed. The action sequences have pace, are eventful and fantastic.",7,0,0,20 September 2008
Underworld," Very Enjoyable
","Sexy Kate Beckinsale is a vampire, perched on a window high up. She tells us about the centuries old war between them and the Lycans (werewolves). What starts from there, is a thoroughly enjoyable dark, mythical, action-adventure film, till the very end.There is a sufficiently engaging plot. The writers have kept it simple. The vampires, in their story, do not possess any powers that gives then any edge over their rivals. That makes the fight and the struggle almost human. The action sequences are choreographed well. They look stylish and thrilling.We are given doses of history and flashbacks, intelligently cut not to drag on and ensuring that the story stays in present.Underworld is not an edge-of-the-seat film but definitely a very neat thriller. Very enjoyable !",7,0,0,4 July 2008
Chak de! India," A New Shahrukh Khan
","Chak De brings out a new Shahrukh Khan or probably the brings back the one we saw in Swades. He is the actor here, though his being the biggest star of the times ensured a full house when I saw Chak De this morning.Chak De is a sports film. That itself makes it a very rare film to come out of Bollywood. The director Shimit Amin and writer Jaideep Sahni venture out where very few dare in Mumbai. And, they have come out trumps.The film does many things which probably should inspire many in the film industry. First and foremost is the need to do original and innovative work. The film leaps out of the routine run-of-the-mill productions of Hindi film industry, with class. Second, give their due to the character roles. Write them out with focus and intention. It is not only the lead roles that need to be chiseled well. The girls in the film carry it forward as much as Shahrukh Khan.The film is edited very well. It has pace and flow.Finally, Shahrukh Khan. This film may well be the start of his second innings. Earlier stars (Amitabh Bachchan, Dilip Kumar, etc) never knew what to do during their middle-ages. Bachchan did trash films like Toofan, Jadugar, etc. Script-writers did not know what to do with such stars. Shahrukh Khan is fast approaching that phase of his career, if not already there. He has opened doors for himself. From what I saw in Chak De, I'm waiting in anticipation for things to come. This, in spite of the fact that I'm not a Shahrukh Khan fan as yet.Chak De is the best film that has come out this summer. A must watch !P.S: Hoping Chak De does its bit to revive sporting spirit in the country and makes us see beyond cricket.",6,4,10,11 August 2007
Forrest Gump," Life is a box of chocolates
","Forrest Gump was there at every momentous occasion in American history during his lifetime. But he never realizes this. He just walks through them like an evening stroll in the park. But as I watched his life go by, he tugged at my heart like very few film characters have.When Forrest Gump meets his son, the first thing he wants to know is whether his son is smart. It is 'the' moment of the film and almost moved me to tears. It is shattering to realize that Forrest all along knows what everybody thought of him. At once, we see the courageous person that he is behind his mild demeanor.Tom Hanks plays the role of his lifetime. He is just perfect. I cannot imagine anybody else as Forrest Gump.I have seem Forrest Gump about five times till now. The film only grows on me every time I see it. A great film.",8,1,3,19 July 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Reaffirming the real sunshine of life
","A cute little girl wants to win a beauty pageant. She and her family set out on a road trip of many hundred miles on a rickety bus. The challenges and imperfections of life mock on the faces of the characters and they stand by each other as a family. That is pretty much the plot. Does the little girl go on to win the pageant? Find out for yourself.It is so much a story of everyone of us that we want to see and hear it more eagerly as the film unfolds. As it usually happens, the journey always so much more than the destination itself.Little Miss Sunshine, of course, falls into the category of 'feel-good' films - films that you think about while driving back from the cinemas, or on waking up the next morning, and the thought leaves a smile on your face. It talks about family, honesty and being yourself - virtues that'll never go out of fashion. Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris pull of something that is probably most difficult in film making - tell a simple story about ordinary people.Abigail Breslin is no less a sunshine herself - brilliant and natural. She carries the film the way even veterans struggle to do.The final stage scene reminded me of my first time on stage. It was an extempore competition at school and I must have looked just as nervous as Olive. Only that when it was my turn to perform, I was not even an inch as confident as her. Obviously, I sucked big time. But Olive, she rocked.",7,0,0,1 April 2007
No Country for Old Men," Second half is a let down
","The film starts like a thriller. We meet Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who seems to be killing for fun. Then we meet Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who finds a bag full of dollars. And then, Anton is chasing Moss. The film moves like a thriller. But unfortunately, it does not end like one.There is no history or reason to Bardem's character. He is pure evil. He is invincible. On the contrary, Brolin's character is real and vulnerable. This difference in their characters lends a demon-vs-human kind of feel to the story. But the second half of the film disappoints. Chigurh's chase and Moss' accidental fortune both end in nothing. Then there is Tommy Lee Jones character which I found added nothing to the storyline, other than dollops of philosophical musings.Javier Bardem packs in a powerhouse performance. The cinematography is fantastic. Coen brothers do create an interesting character in Chigurh. But all that are achievements in isolation. I failed to understand what the story was about. It would have been an interesting thriller with a more simpler and straight forward climax.",6,12,27,18 February 2008
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi," 'Raj' yet again from YRF
","Rab Ne opens with a bespectacled SRK with mustaches, wearing trousers and sneakers, alighting a train with his bride. That shot, at once, shatters the image that SRK has had over the years in Yashraj films. I could sense excitement running through my veins. But alas, it was short lived. Very soon, they return to 'Raj' business that we have been made to endure over the years.SRK impresses as the docile Sukhi but as Raj he varies from flamboyant to a buffoon. The newcomer Anushka Sharma is very impressive. This is easily the best debut performance of the year so far. She is convincing throughout the film and is not intimidated by the towering presence of SRK.Sukhwinder Singh ('Hole Hole') and Sunidhi Chouhan ('Dance pe Chance') lend their voices to probably the two best sung songs of the year. Both are choreographed equally well.Rab Ne does have a story but it lacks any subtlety. For some reasons, SRK speaks out all emotions leaving nothing for the viewers to extrapolate. No time is spent on telling us how Taani falls in love with Sukhi. The only apparent explanation is that she sees Sukhi walking towards her in the background of the Golden Temple. It seemed that SRK's character, while playing the Sukhi vs. Raj game, got confused in what he really wanted to achieve after all.Aditya Chopra is a talented director and I don't doubt that. But Rab Ne is just a box-office pleaser attempt and not anything to test himself.",6,4,11,15 December 2008
The Dark Knight," To Heath Ledger
","Batman has human weaknesses and is still a superhero. This, I think, is what endears him to his fans. 'Batman Begins' brings that out beautifully. In 'The Dark Knight' the tension is not within Bruce Wayne, but outside. It is about how Gotham perceives him - the people of the city not liking him; blaming him for deaths, and so on. At this juncture, we see Joker, who apparently is challenging Batman at a moral level. Joker is a criminal for his own sake, not for money or anything else. Just as Batman is a protector of Gotham for his own sake. The plot does not bring out this moral dilemma or conflict of Batman, except in few instances. The plot is in conflict with itself in trying to create an action film and to create a moral war between the hero and the villain.What makes the film out of the ordinary is Heath Ledger. His interpretation of the character and how he just seems to delve deep into that role is amazing. Few actors have lived out a character like that for the entire duration of a film.",7,0,6,19 July 2008
Up," A humane story amid a color riot
","It is difficult to get the image of that flying house suspended by countless colorful balloons off your head, once you see Up. I guess, it would stay with me for the rest of my life.Up easily climbs up to claim a place amongst the finest animation films ever. Not surprisingly, it comes from Pixar, the team that gave us Wall-E, Ratatouille and Finding Nemo. Also, after a quite a long time, its about 'people' as against a garbage-crusher, a rat and fishes respectively earlier. Up is as colorful as an animation film ever was. What a color riot! Some frames just stay with you, the mastery of their composition impossible to miss.The choice of characters itself breaks clichés. A grumpy old man as the hero and an amiable obese kid as his ally completely contrast against what one would have thought would be the choice for characters who are supposed to be on an adventure trip to South America. Both characters endear themselves to us as the story moves along.Two things that stood out for me - (a) The initial sequence that chronicles the life of Fredrickson and Ellie together is a master-stroke. As it ends, it leaves the eyes moist - and all that without a word spoken. (b) The closing shot with the house perched besides the paradise falls - it is one for the textbooks; probably one of the best closing shots ever.Not to be missed at any cost.",9,2,4,20 September 2009
Stranger Than Fiction," A New Will Farrell
","Will Farrell is in a new avatar. Is this the turning point of his career? Time alone can tell. But not for Harold Crick. His life is being controlled not by time but by a tragedy writer Karen Eiffel. Her fiction is his life. Harold is tied up in a routine and going through his life lonely and unaware, until he realizes that he is a part of somebody's storyline.This film is an example of how incidental cruelty is acceptable in cinema but obvious cruelty is not. Harold Crick could have died at the end but cannot because the viewers are already told he is going to die untimely and unnaturally. From that moment on, the viewers knows that Harold won't die but the question is how will he survive. This is an intelligent way to implicitly engage the viewers in the opposite of the actual proceeding all the while and at the end surprise them with what they already expected. It is traditional, but still a challenge for the writer and the director.Zach Helm does not complicate the story though he had all the opportunities. He does not focus on the events but on their impact. The idea, I guess, is to capture the helplessness and resignation when somebody already knows what is to follow. Bill Murray was in the same state in The Groundhog Day. Surprising the response of Murray's character and Harold's are very similar. They accept it and wait for it to end, whenever and in whatever manner.Will Farrell fits Harold like a glove. Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson are seasoned actors and deliver what you expect from them. Maggies Gyllenhaal is good but her character is very predictable.",6,0,1,8 April 2007
WALL·E," The Endearing Wall-E
","Wall-E is a love story of two robots. That, along the way, they resurrect the human race and the planet earth is something they might not have even realized.Wall-E is easily the best film of the year so far. It is amazing how a soiled old piece of metallic equipment can keep you engaged for an entire duration of a film, and even tug at your heart at times. Wall-E is a robot who collects trash and compresses them into cubes. He stacks these cubes to build skyscrapers. Apparently he is the only one left on planet earth, other than his pet cockroach. But Wall-E is not a dumb robot. He has his stash of variety of stuff collected from the garbage he works on. Of these is an i-pod that plays an oldie for him. I'd never know for sure what Wall-E feels on watching that video. The best guess is he is reminded of his loneliness. Then one day, Eve appears and Wall-E's tranquil old world is sent into a twirl. It is about at half-time that 'humans' appear. It was then that I realized that all I was hearing till now was clanking of metals.Wall-E is great animation and brilliant sound engineering. There are many ways to interpret this film but a simple love story, between two unlikely candidates - robots, suits just as good. The way Wall-E and Eve call out each other's names, I guess it is the first time that just names have had that impact on the viewers since Marlon Brando called out Stella in 'A Streetcar Named Desire'.A must-see.",8,0,3,8 September 2008
300," Cheoreograhed Gore in Sepia
","300 is a feast for the eyes. All the things that are good about this film is solely to the credit of the technicians who brought the stunning visuals alive on the screen. Rest is just an effort to justify those visuals.At the outset, we are briefed on how a Spartan is prepared from childhood for a life of combat. For him, the highest glory is to sacrifice himself for the cause of Sparta in a battlefield. King Leonidas is no exception. Not much time is then wasted on building up the premise for an epic battle. Rest of the film is the epic battle itself.Zack Synder, the director, no doubt has given us a film with visuals like none seen recently. It is a spectacle the holds the audience in thrall till the end. But he, otherwise, is not concerned with injecting any novelty in the storyline. There is the usual rejected soldier who defects to the opposition, the usual pain at the loss of a close one for an important character, the usual politics away from the battlefront, the usual unsung sacrifices of the women - all in all the usual storyline of any battle story. Not to say that these usual helpings are irrelevant, but they are all such an integral of part of any historical battle drama that there is a deja vu throughout.During the early years of cinema, the film backgrounds were usually just painted out - mountains, trees, skylines. There was no on-the-location filming. The cars would stay still and the background moved, usually a film running on a screen behind. When you look at those old films, all that seem quite funny. Apparently, the audience of those times did not mind it. Films always depend on what the audience intelligence of the times accept. Similarly, the whole of 300 is a computer graphics painted brilliant battle scenery. Our intelligence of the day is awed by it. We cannot guess what will happen ten years from now.Witnessing the sepia 300, my senses today had a great time. As the Spartan King Leonidas says,'We're in for one wild night'!",6,0,4,18 March 2007
Atonement," A Labor of Love
","Atonement is a labor of love. Each frame of this film is crafted with patience and diligence. You can almost see the storyboard sketches that went into creating what you see on screen. There are some amazing shots which, in fact, the film could have done without while still retaining the quality that it has. But that the makers chose to work hard even on those scenes tells about their attention to detail. For instance, the scene where the Robbie (James McAvoy) is walking with his two fellow soldiers and there is a reflection of the fighter plane on the water canal.The sequence of the army base/camp at the sea shore is amazing. It is the most elaborately designed and executed shot I have ever seen.Besides the technical brilliance, the film rides on a very strong script and good performances. Briony Tallis' guilt is the center along which the story revolves. The love between Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and Robbie is complex. The duration that their love is latent is longer than it is actually expressed. Even more longer is the period where it survives only in their memories and thoughts, with the war and the distance separating them. I guess it was the cruelties and the distress of the war, and the times, that makes them hold on to their love. Otherwise, possibly they would have moved on.The film adopts a non-linear narration style. It repeats may sequences and events, looked at each time from a different character's perspective. This acts like a dissection of the events, making the story look complex and yet opening it up threadbare.The ending, I felt, did not live up to the rest of the film. Briony opening up to an interviewer to tell the actual truth seemed unlike her. I wonder, if I take that ending out, what would have Briony made of her life. Would she have been consumed by her guilt completely? Would she have moved on? With this ending, I guess she did move on.A brilliant film. One of the best I have seen this decade.",8,4,6,23 June 2008
