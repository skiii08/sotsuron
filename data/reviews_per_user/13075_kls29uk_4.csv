The Blair Witch Project," Watching this is a Complete and Utter waste of part of your life
","I cannot understand how anyone can like this film and actually be scared by it.  It is pure and unadulterated trash.  I was waiting and waiting for something to actually happen and when the credits came up I felt cheated. I was recently persuaded to watch Blair Witch 2 and it is 200% better that the first but it is still pants.  If there is a third, I for one will not watch it.0/10",1,13,24,10 August 2002
Minority Report," One of the best films of 2002
","What a movie !!!  Watched it twice in two days, enjoyed it so much.I had begun to wonder whether Spielberg had lost his magic. Mainly because of Jurassic Park II and A.I., but I wonder no more.  This film is superb. The acting first class.  Tom Cruise and Samantha Morton shine in a cast with no flaws.  The depiction of the future is fascinating.***POSSIBLE SPOILER***The only flaw I could find with this film was part of the plot.  At one point Anderton (Tom Cruise), has to have an eye transplant, the reasons for which I won't go into.  He then takes his original eyes, in a plastic bag, to the pre-crime police department where he works, to enable him to get into the building.  He has all the police force searching for him to arrest him but he is not barred from entering the building ??? How weird is that ???But other than that rather minor flaw, I would recommend this movie.  At least an 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,7 December 2002
Memento," Superb, Confusing, Fascinating
",Watched this film purely because it was #10 in the Top 250 index on your database.  So glad I did.  It is pure class.  You start watching it and get drawn in virtually immediately.  Once its finished you have a million questions. Even struggled to go to sleep after seeing it as I couldn't stop thinking about it.Guy Pierce is excellent (hard to imagine him as Mike in Neighbours now!)This film has gone straight into my personal Top 10.Thank you IMDb.,9,0,2,22 July 2002
X-Men," With my arm twisted up my back and various methods of torture inflicted upon me, I would say this film is good
","I discussed this film with a very good friend of mine.  He loved it, I hated it.  He has told me that I must write a review for this film and find something good to say about it.So here goes:  Hugh Jackman !!!",2,2,4,15 December 2002
