Skyfall," mediocre
","nonsense from start to finish.....nothing makes much sense....if you like a movie that simply has everyone running and jumping aimlessly, a villain that is laughable, everyone is a complete idiot and incompetent, and absolutely no plot, this is the movie for you...one of the absolutely worst Bond movies ever.....only thing worse would be to bring back Roger Moore......wait for the DVD or stream it to your IPhone (still a waste of time and money)......next up for Bond....a Mad Plumber plans to clog all the toilets in London....by using 'non flushable wipes' ....yikes!!!! ...only Bond can stop him and his evil plumber apprentice henchman.....",3,11,22,24 November 2012
Avengers: Infinity War," Marvel Trash
",I know what comes next.......Thor wakes up and he's in a shower and none of this actually happened!!!! ....and Thanos only kills off 1/2 of all living beings..too bad...I was hoping Thanos would kill off everyone (including the Bus Driver) and we'd be done with this dribble. Probably won't happen....I can dream however....and I won't bother with going to the movies for AVENGERS: Thors Shower.........and I can't wait for Thanos to become a 'good guy'........plot makes less sense then a bugs bunny cartoon...I give the dribble factor a 9........,2,129,303,6 May 2018
