Skyfall," Many, many missteps.
","This review really does have spoilers, just to let you know.SKYFALL has amazing action! One of the strengths of the Daniel Craig Bond films has been unbelievably intense, nerve shredding action sequences, and Skyfall's have lived up to the standard and then some. Except for an unfortunate final act.Daniel Craig's performance as Bond is superb for the third time in a row. He made the role his own from his first Bond film. His presence is riveting in all of his scenes.Javier Bardem is a fun villain, as we'd expect. I pretty much rooted for him the whole movie. His odd bleach job is a little annoying, especially when he's trying to run around in the subways in a policeman's uniform.OK, now that that's over, Let's get into this movie's problems.#1. More length than story. Like X2, Superman Returns,and Moonrise Kingdom, this movie reaches a point where it should be over, but then drags on for another half hour.#2. This movie is not really a James Bond film. It is a Judi Dench 'M'. film with James Bond cameos. Apparently, this being her last, the creators felt they had to center it around her, and give her a massive send off. A Viking funeral, of sorts. It is a sentimental character piece that pays loving tribute to a background character as if she were the heart of the whole franchise. This really wears out its welcome very quickly.A strength of both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace was that their villains' plans were global and so complex they really couldn't be explained within the context of the films. We, as the audience, were along for the fast paced ride, and just had to snatch the details we were given out of the air as we raced by. It wasn't important to understand every facet of the enemy, and that was for the better.So, to bring this back to the point, Raoul Silva's plans, at first intriguing and exciting, suddenly become simply about his obsession with M. In fact, getting back at her and trying to win her love seem to be his only motivations. It's really kind of a letdown.#3. Another strength of the Bond films was that moving or emotional content wasn't up front, but rather shone unexpectedly through the cracks, and was all the more moving and gave the films substance through their subtlety.In SKYFALL, that subtlety is replaced with heavy-handed, unwelcome sentimentality. All the fawning over Dench is bad enough, culminating in a ridiculous parliamentary inquiry where she pontificates, but even that is really just a prelude to the film's worst aspect, the final act, where Bond takes her to his parents' stately abandoned Scottish manor to await a siege.It's a mistake to start shining a light into Bond's past if all they're going to reveal comes out of Harlequin romances. The dashing fellow from the Scottish highlands who takes the lady to his stately manor to save her life... really? THIS lady? But it's not just romance novels that this film evokes. It also evokes comic books. Now Bond is a tormented orphan (like Batman!) with a faithful manservant (Like Batman!) who has a mansion full of secret passages (like Batman!)... It's been noted that Mendes says he was inspired by Nolan's Batman films. Well, it really shows.Another dubious thing about this reveal is that it is ALSO revealed that 'James Bond' is in fact his actual name. I liked it better when it seemed to have been a cover name. But that's just me. We go through an awful lot of drawn out siege-style action at the end of this movie that somehow reminded me of both Straw Dogs AND the end of Pineapple Express except that it's just not all that interesting, because it's only about protecting Judi Dench, who had apparently some years prior deliberately blown Silva's cover and let the Chinese have him (???) for reasons she gives that seem pretty weak... She's not all that likable and I wasn't that invested in wanting her to survive. Which means I wasn't that invested in the actual plot of this M. movie.",4,10,22,11 November 2012
The Devil Wears Prada," The engine that drives this film.
","This film is entirely wish fulfillment. The central character is a nice, smart, and pretty, yet down to earth. She is basically what all women wish to be seen as.She goes into a superficial environment where everybody makes fun of her for being down to earth and smart. But, everybody recognizes the goodness within and quickly come around to praising and admiring her. She frequently meets challenges and the outcome is always that everyone around her is impressed.She is faces with an unpleasant, jealous co-worker, but she turns this person around into being her friend even as she usurps her place.She meets a dashing, idealized young man who helps her out of jams and tells her how pretty she is.Her mother figure is cruel and demanding. She strives to please her and becomes more like her, and finally gets free of her having created her own success.Most blatant is her relationship with her girlish boyfriend, who exists only to support her ego and be perfect. He is is good looking, successful, kind, and loyal. When she disappoints him and demands to discuss it, his offensive is to tell her that she is, in fact, pretty.This movie has no relation to reality. It is a Mary Sue story with candy coated walls that validates every insecurity women nurture within their empty heads.",2,3,6,8 December 2012
Dreamgirls," see. this. movie!.
","DREAMGIRLS, the story of black popular American music from the late '50's through to the mid '70's, as told with a focus on a Supremes-like trio of singers, is the kind of movie that comes along only rarely, a truly great film.But this movie succeeds on every level: music, cinematography, acting, script, direction, set design, costume design... The end result is outstanding. Unbelievable. This should be one of those films that is nominated in every category, it is that amazing. Nothing is spared. It is truly something special.There are many strong characters, and every actor in the cast shines. For me to praise each individually as they deserve would be to write a book, but it's hard to resist. Beyonce? Amazing. Jennifer Hudson? Superhuman. Eddie Murphy? Remember back when he was the biggest star in Hollywood? For the first time in years he is here to show us why, and what kind of talent and power has been waiting to shine again.I want to thank everyone involved for bringing this wonderful movie to life. This will be remembered as one of the greatest films in movie history.",10,0,1,28 January 2007
The Departed," Scorcese's welcome return to urban crime, Nicholson's welcome retreat from romantic comedy.....
","Martin Scorscese's return to urban crime is as fluid, loud, and intense as one might hope. Mixing the exact right songs with his fluid camera work, he gives us an intense, complicated walk through a dangerous town during its most dangerous times.The cast is all superb. DiCaprio is intense. Nicholson's performance is only hindered by his past work; he doesn't have to build the character because we already know what he's about the instant he first appears, since we know him so well. It's a gimme. The addition of Ray Winstone as Mr. French, Nicholson's second in command, was a wise choice. Winstone brings his menacing character to vivid, bloody life.While based on the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, The Departed is not entirely chained to that film's storyline. Some of the differences are as follows (SPOILERS): DiCaprio's parallel character in Infernal Affairs, played wonderfully by Tony Leung as Yan, has been undercover for ten years. DiCaprio's Billy Costigan is only undercover for one year. Damon's Collin Sullivan is perceived as charismatic by his peers, but has almost no redeemable qualities. His Infernal Affairs parallel, Tony Leung's Ming, is secretive, but not fake. Ming is a lot more likable to the audience, and conflicted about his loyalties.Nicholson's parallel character in Infernal affairs, Eric Tsang as Sam, has no right hand man to parallel Ray Winstone's Mr. French. Similarly, Anthony Wong's Inspector Wong, the parallel to Martin Sheen's Queenan, has no right hand man to parallel Mark Wahlberg's Sgt Dingnum.A little more of DiCaprio/Costigan's background is given in The Departed than is Yan's in Infernal Affairs I. However, in Infernal Affairs II, More of Yan's background is given, and it is a lot different than Billy Costigan's.Finally, the biggest and most effective difference: In Infernal Affairs, Ming has a fiancée and Yan has a female psychiatrist, and they are two different women. In The Departed, these two female characters are combined, so that Damon/Sullivan's fiancée IS DiCaprio/Costigan's psychiatrist.It should be highly enjoyed by anyone who likes a good, intense urban crime drama.",8,0,2,9 October 2006
Fifty Shades of Grey," A Dull Film that does Nothing Right
","This movie has several problems and almost no virtues. Let's just go down the line. 1. It's boring. No matter what a movie is about, there is no excuse for being boring. This movie in particular, which is supposed to be so hot and erotic, should be engaging. It is not. The filmmakers' sole mission was to get people into the theater, but they felt themselves under no obligation to entertain them once they were there. Once the tickets are bought, mission accomplished. You are not in good hands here.2. Jamie Dornan. Little Jamie Dornan, who is trying to portray an uber-confident, menacing, Nietzchean superman, just has no way to pull it off. With his boyish wave of sunny curls, he seems like he could play a farmer's hardworking son in a period piece, or an innocent young sailor like Billy Budd, or maybe an earnest young priest in an episode of Murder She Wrote. Christian Grey was supposed to radiate sexual menace. Jamie Dornan radiates kinda wanting to ask you to a prom. (It also doesn't help that he is very short). Grey is supposed to be serious and commanding, but when Dornan tries to be this character he just sounds like a robot. He would be an excellent choice to play C-3PO in the Star Wars revival because he's definitely got the moves, but if he'd have to work on giving his voice some personality. 3. Christian Gray. This character makes no sense. He sets all these rules on this woman he's trying to court, but that's really it. That's all he does. He thinks up rules and gets her to come to his house. Because of the awkward flow of the movie this makes even less sense, because he sets these rules and then breaks them, but still acts like they're inflexible. Maybe this makes more sense in the books, but I will never know. He is also a big douchebag. There's no other way to describe him. Ana drunk-dials him and his reaction is so dorky and lame that it would be great comedy if it were intentional. 'Have have you been DRINKING???' Uh. OK.. Then he shows up at the bar and angrily flexes on the most harmless character in the movie as if either of them were badasses of some sort It's a moment that really just falls flat.4. Anastasia Steele. The character, not the actress. Anastasia is a frumpy cipher who works in a hardware store and is pursuing a useless degree. You know the phrase 'she basic'. well, she basic. The only thing I can figure out about her is that her lack of personality or motivation makes her non-threatening to other women. As long as she is nothing and has accomplished nothing, none of the women readers feel as if she reflects badly on them.5. The visuals. This is a bleak, joyless, sterile movie. A movie that is supposed to be sensual and erotic should be something you can't take your eyes off of, but this movie is almost challenging to watch. Everywhere they go, inside or outside, looks like the inside of either a clean or a dirty bucket. Also, the movie spends way too much time in closeup on the leads. I got really tired of their boring, expressionless faces.6. The supporting characters. Anastasia's friends are just supposed to be pieces of a support structure that holds her up for us to like but the problem is that they are actually more interesting and likable than she or Christian Gray. Eloise Mumford plays Anastasia's roommate Kate, and she is supposed to be superficial and shallow, but supportive. The problem is that Eloise Mumford is more interesting and fun than anything else in this movie. She lights up the screen whenever she's on. Anastasia has a young suitor named Jose, who is a photographer and likes her a lot. He's actually a little too good for her, but she friendzones him rather mercilessly. He does give Christian Gray an opportunity to act like a douchebag in a very funny scene though. She also works with a nice young guy at the hardware store. He is easygoing, friendly and supportive, and is also interested in her for some unfathomable reason. She can't stand him. Well, the guy is tall. Really tall. Tall for women is like big boobs and blue eyes for men. There's no way she would physically prefer little Jamie Dornan over her tall co-worker.7. Story. Ultimately, the movie can not possibly succeed because the story is just so stupid. The fetish/BDSM elements are shoehorned in so awkwardly and they never, ever work at all. The story would make more sense without the dungeon and the contracts. Those aspects are really just obvious metaphors for Gray's sexual impotence. Not very sexy at all.8. Dakota Johnson. Well, she basic. They really would have been better off giving this to Sasha Grey. She could have livened it up considerably and wouldn't have been nearly as dull.Funny side note... after I wrote this I noticed that it was my 51st movie review on IMDb!",1,10,18,22 February 2015
