The Devil's Advocate," best movie ever made
","Finally, my search to the quest for the best movie has ended, for I am sure I won't ever see a movie better than this one. Especially for religious people I would recommend this movie, because it shows the dangers of this world, in particularly the dangers of vanity.When this movie was in the cinema, I didn't go see it, because it looked to scary, and i don't like movies with demons etcetera. As i saw the movie i could imagine why I (and I know a lot of other people together with me) didn't want to see it at first, but in the end it all becomes clear, and hence i can say that all the violence and sex isn't put in the movie to make it more attractive, but it is merely used to disgust it, and therefore it is pure functional .The moral struck me (this is the first movie i saw in which the 'forces of evil' aren't pictured as visible monsters which have to be fought) and the last scene leaves everybody I know who saw it wondering what really happened: wake-up call or second attempt? For those who haven't seen the movie yet, I don't want to say too much, because the power of the movie would fade. But even if you know how the movie ends, you still be overwhelmed; this is what happened to me.In conclusion I recommend this movie to everyone, see it till the end if you want to get the message of it.",10,1,1,5 May 1999
Reservoir Dogs," Bravo Tarantino!!
","This movie simply deals with the question who betrayed the robbery. The first hour the viewer doesn't have a slightest clue as well as the players. By showing flashbacks we get to see an objective view of the person's character. Then suddenly the snatcher betrays him, and the story develops to the tragical anti-climax.By making this low-budget movie, Tarantino shows he is superb. The structure is outstanding (great use of flash-backs and flash-forwards), the music is outstanding (this movie is responsible for the come-back of the George Baker Selection), the players perform high skill acting (Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen), the dialogues are stunning (very bad language, but isn't that realistic in these 'cultures'?).Bottomline: if you haven't seen it yet, see it; it's a must-see.",9,0,1,15 May 1999
