Walk the Line," I was shocked!
","My mother is a huge country music fan. So, naturally, she wanted to see this movie. Personally, I'm not much of a country music fan ... I liked Alabama ... a little Shaina Twain ... and a little of Toby Keith. I wasn't exactly a 'willing' movie goer, but ... I got the shock of my life! 'Walk The Line' was an EXCELLENT movie! Let me say that, again. 'Walk The Line' was an EXCELLENT movie! I was amazed at how Joaquin mastered Johnny Cash's movements. Reese Witherspoon was equally amazing, especially when they did the duet on 'Jackson'. Although, I don't remember June ever being THAT CUTE! It must have been before my time.Bottom line: THIS WAS A QUALITY FILM, WITH GREAT TALENT! It was in-depth. Honest. It didn't sugar-coat reality. It handed it to you, and said, 'Here! This is how it really was!' Joaquin & Reese sound AWESOME! Few actors & actresses actually have good pipes! These two do! They both deserve, at the least, an Oscar nomination! If you haven't seen it, TREAT YOURSELF! I'm going to spend Thanksgiving hearing my mother say, 'I told you so!' But, hey, sometimes mom does know best. THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE TIMES!!!",9,2,4,24 November 2005
