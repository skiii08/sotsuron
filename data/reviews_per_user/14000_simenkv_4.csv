Deja Vu," Incredibly silly cash-machine.
","Tony Scott reaches new peaks of lameness with this thriller. Tony Scott also directed the somewhat more successful Enemy Of The State, which by the way has a similar theme, and the abysmal Domino.True, it has a good pace when it comes to action and suspense, but all this is really negligible when you look at such small things as the premises for the story.When science is used to create a plot twist, the producers should really use a scientific consultant, instead of going 'Hey, that would be cool! And what if we make the gizmo do THIS kind of fancy trick ...' The results are invariable laughable and lame, not to say insulting to the viewer's intelligence.Well, plot holes aside, what about the handiwork? The editing and camera-work is above average, the music is a bit annoying (what IS it with that backwards piano sample that fancy thrillers use these days?), but the visual effects are very good.As for the casting ... We don't get to know Denzel Washingtons character in any depth. Actually, all the characters are quite flat, except perhaps for Paula Patton's character Claire. Denzel also has strange uncharacteristic outbursts of laughter at very misplaced moments, that gave me that uneasy feeling that he was downright insane. That wasn't the intention, was it ... ? It's just as if Tony Scott said: 'Hey, I was not entirely satisfied by the performance here; let's shoot that laughing sequence again, laugh *harder*, and cut-and-paste it into the original scene.' It is actually disturbing to look at. Val Kilmer is horrible as always (do something about that mole, for crying out loud, and smarten up!) and some of the one-liners are really off the scale in lameness. (For example something like 'It's a really bad week to quit smoking hash' from a science-guy. Hardy-har.) Jim 'Holy Man' Caviezel is actually quite good in this flick. He was scary sometimes.Bottom line: Annoying movie, but enjoyable action when you forget about all the negative things for a minute.",3,5,11,16 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Over-done conclusion.
","The final (?) movie in the X-men series was a bit disappointing. Where the two first movies were subtle and had rather good character development, this episode was over the top with silly one-liners and an endless gallery of characters that could populate a small city.The main cast, however, is overall great: Famke Janssen is stunning as the tormented Jean Grey, while Hugh Jackman is tougher than ever, and Kelsey Grammar is perfectly cast as Beast. Patrick Stewart (as always) delivers a great performance, while Ian McKellen as Magneto is good, but the one-liners he gets makes Magneto a parody of himself.In my opinion, X-men 3 lacked the finesse of the two predecessors: Magneto has become a true megalomaniac lacking the intelligent sense of logic he used to have, and where we previously were left to ponder and really feel with the characters (as in the complex friendship of Wolverine and Rogue), we are faced with an endless list of more and more powerful mutants with no function in the story, other than making Halle Berry as Storm look puny with her fog and lightning.Moreover, I felt that the violence became a bit too extreme: There is simply too much killing in this movie. Perhaps it was supposed to make the story more grave and powerful. However, the story is after all based on a comic with silly super-heroes in colored spandex suits, and violence was always very superficial in the comics. But here, bystanders and more or less innocent people are killed off without as much as a flinch.A really entertaining movie, nonetheless, but not a very satisfying conclusion to the otherwise indisputably best super hero comic-adaptation series to date.",6,1,2,23 May 2006
The Fly," Kafka meets Lovecraft -- one of the best!
","If you want to see only one David Cronenberg film, this may be the one. It is simply the most accessible and entertaining of his movies, while adding that little extra to the standard horror flick, making it a deeply disturbing treat. It has good acting, outstanding special effects and score, and that hallmark David Cronenberg fear-your-own-body theme.The theme can be summarized as a tale of bodily mutations, as a scientists gets fly DNA mixed into his own. It's like Kafka had met Lovecraft for a beer.But one watch out for the severely cut version: Stay away if it's 91 minutes long! The gruesome ending is cut into dadaism in this version, which sadly is the most common on DVD.",8,1,2,28 May 2006
High Fidelity," Terrific adaption of Nick Hornby's best-selling novel.
","I was a bit sceptical at first; it being an English novel adapted for the big-screen by Americans. These doubts vanished after about four minutes of the movie. The acting is very good, the dialogues are funny, the script is very true to the book (except for being set in the US, some minor name discrepancies and such details) and let's not forget the soundtrack!Music lovers, heart-broken guys (and gals), people with an eye for good film: I can certainly recommend this movie. If you loved the book, you'll love the movie! I give it an awesome 9 out of 10, (and that's rare.)-Simen.",9,0,1,20 August 2000
