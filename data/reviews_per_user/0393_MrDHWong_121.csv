Ford v Ferrari," A well-told story that balances high octane car races with genuine drama
","Ford v Ferrari is a biographical drama film directed by James Mangold (Logan, Walk The Line, Girl, Interrupted). Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, it is a well-told story that balances high octane car races with genuine drama.In 1963, the Ford Motor Company recruits famous racecar driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to assist them with designing a car that will help them beat their arch rivals Ferrari at the Le Mons race in France. To aid him with such a task, Carroll decides to enlist the help of British mechanic and fellow racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to test for any flaws and eventually race in the finished product itself. At first, the two of them make great progress, however Ken's brash personality and blunt honesty puts him at odds with the higher ups at Ford, causing the company to believe he may not be the right person to be racing their car and representing them abroad.With its fast pacing and heartfelt drama to match, Ford v Ferrari rises above the typical car racing film to become one of the most interesting portraits of an intense rivalry in recent memory. The film isn't so much about the cars themselves as as it is about staying relevant in the public eye and maintaining a respectable image. From the very beginning, we are given the idea of how desperate Ford are to shake off their reputation of being perceived as making outdated cars that only one's grandparents would drive. This is juxtaposed with the cool and hip-looking Ferrari being presented as more appealing to younger potential motorists. The resulting races are used to further the film's plot and aren't merely there for mindless entertainment. While it may be obvious to some viewers what the eventual outcome truly is, it is certainly a lot of fun anticipating what happens along the way.Director James Mangold successfully strikes the correct balance between car racing action and realistic human drama, so much so that virtually all audiences should be able to find something to be entertained by. His choices in editing and cinematography help move the film along at a breathless speed as we watch cars zoom past at high acceleration, sometimes resulting in some intense crash scenes. There are times though, where some of the mechanical jargon may prove confusing to non-racing enthusiasts such as myself as I did end up scratching my head at a few scenes where certain important car parts were being discussed by the characters. In addition to this, I wasn't quite sure about how some of the rules of the race track were showcased in the film, as it felt somewhat glanced over. Fortunately, these moments are infrequent and are often counteracted by the great acting of the film's leads.Christian Bale is such a joy to watch as Ken Miles, the unapologetic perfectionist racer who wants to push the limits of what a car can do. It caught me off-guard at first hearing him use his native British accent while surrounded by other Americans as I am so used to seeing him play only American characters. Matt Damon gave a nice performance as well, but I feel that he was overshadowed by Bale in most scenes. This is due to Damon essentially being the straight man to Bale's outspoken antics which did cause me to focus more on Bale instead.Overall, even if you aren't a huge fan of car racing films like me, this one contains more than enough entertainment to satisfy even the most car illiterate of audiences. The historic value of the depicted event makes for a solid drama and could possibly bring a newfound amount of respect to this genre in the near future.I rate it 8.5/10",9,3,4,30 January 2020
Blade Runner 2049," A masterpiece of science fiction and possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made
","Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel to the 1982 sci-fi classic Blade Runner. Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) and once again based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, it successfully recaptures just about everything excellent about the original and is a superb sequel to one of the greatest and most important science fiction films of all time.Thirty years after the events of the first film, LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) works as a Blade Runner, retiring old rogue replicants (artificial humans) hiding out around the Los Angeles area. One day while on a job, K discovers a long buried secret in the yard of a replicant which leads him on a journey to track down former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who has been missing for decades.Featuring amazing visuals and some of the most philosophical and thought-provoking themes since the original, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece of science fiction and is possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made. I was transfixed the entire time, to the point where I felt that even blinking would cause me to miss something I wanted to see. The cast was brilliant as well, especially Ryan Gosling, who does a fantastic job carrying the film as its lead actor. However, perhaps best of all, is that seeing the original is not a requirement to fully understand everything that is going on, although it would probably still help to have done so beforehand. I'm almost certain that author Philip K. Dick would be proud of this film. I know I am.I rate it a very high 9.5/10",10,581,1177,5 October 2017
First Man," A beautifully told and respectable portrait of the famous astronaut's life and the significance of his contribution to human history
","First Man is a historical biographical drama film based on the life of astronaut Neil Armstrong, directed by Damien Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land). Starring Ryan Gosling in the lead role, it paints a beautifully told and respectable portrait of the famous astronaut's life and the significance of his contribution to human history.In the 1960s, the space race between the USA and the USSR is at its peak, with the latter having a clear lead over the former. In attempt to outdo the Soviets, the United States plans a manned mission to the moon, with astronaut Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) being the first to set foot on the lunar surface. Despite the deep personal losses he has endured throughout his training and in his home life, Armstrong agrees to the mission, knowing full well that he may not come back alive.Superbly directed and acted, the film is less a story about the space race itself and more about the struggles and perseverance of titular first man. Ryan Gosling gives what could very well be the performance of his career. His nuanced depiction of Neil Armstrong shows the audience how much the astronaut has to lose if he does not survive such a monumental journey. Claire Foy is also worth noting as Armstrong's first wife Janet. Her concern and worry for her husband's safe return from the moon were brilliantly represented during the film's more emotional scenes. Director Damien Chazelle demonstrates his talent for creative cinematography, showing the vastness of space and how small and insignificant Earth is in comparison. Films like this truly emphasise how much mankind has accomplished in the short amount of time we have existed and further highlight how much more is needed to be done.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,217,385,11 October 2018
Your Name.," Beautifully animated, touching, and funny in all the right places
","Your Name is an anime film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai (5 Centimeters per Second, Children Who Chase Lost Voices, and The Garden of Words). Based on Shinkai's novel of the same name, this film once again showcases the writer/director's ingenuity for telling a poignant story while also featuring gorgeous art and animation.In the rural Japanese town of Itomori, high school girl Mitsuha dreams of a better life, in particular, that of a young successful Tokyo boy. One day, Mitsuha wakes up in the body of Taki, a high school boy living in Tokyo. Initially treating the experience like a dream, Mitsuha (in Taki's body) lives the life she has always wished for, at least until the day is over. However, Mitsuha soon discovers that she actually can periodically switch bodies with Taki, and that everything she does as him happens in real life but just like with dreams, her memories of these events quickly fade away with time.Beautifully animated, touching, and funny in all the right places, Your Name is another fine entry into acclaimed anime writer/director Makoto Shinkai's expanding filmography. Only somebody Japanese could tell such a carefully intertwining story in such emotional detail. The film is very reminiscent of other body-swapping movies such as Freaky Friday and Face/Off, but with a unique eastern influence untouched by the hands of Hollywood. The Japanese voice acting is great and everybody delivers their lines with just the right amount of feeling without seeming too sentimental or sappy. I have yet to see the English dubbed version, but I plan to do so in the not-too-distant future.I rate it 8.5/10",9,3,6,21 June 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," Pretty good, but not great
","10 Cloverfield Lane is a sci-fi mystery film considered to be a 'blood relative' of the 2008 film Cloverfield. In all honesty, I'm not really sure what to make of what I have just seen. While I enjoyed the suspense and mystery surrounding the plot, the pay-off wasn't really worth the effort.After surviving a car crash, a young woman named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) wakes up to find herself in a sealed-shut underground bunker owned by a middle-aged man named Howard (John Goodman). Howard tells Michelle there has been a chemical attack and that the rest of the outside world has become uninhabitable as a result. Michelle, believing she is being held captive by Howard, attempts to think of a plan to escape the bunker and see what is really going on outside.Even though I admired the film's ability to build suspense and a sense of realism, I found the ending somewhat anti-climactic. It's difficult for me to go into too much detail without giving away major spoilers so I'll just say that it left me confused. Both John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead give very good performances. Goodman in particular was very menacing throughout the film. You don't need to have seen the original film to understand what is happening in this one so if you like suspense films, then this film is for you. Unlike the original, this is not a found footage film.From a technical standpoint, I rate it 7/10. From a regular film going experience, I rate it 6/10.",6,3,16,10 March 2016
Deepwater Horizon," A fitting, yet somewhat sensationalistic look at what is now the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history
","Deepwater Horizon is a biographical disaster film starring Mark Wahlberg. Based on the 2010 explosion and oil spill of the titular oil rig, the film is a fitting, yet somewhat sensationalistic look at what is now the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history.On April 20, 2010, the oil rig Deepwater Horizon, located in the Gulf of Mexico, suffers a major blowout, resulting in a huge explosion which kills 11 workers and causes thousands of gallons of oil to leak out into the ocean. The film depicts the events leading up to this incident and the workers desperate to escape the raging inferno on board.While the film does tend to overly-dramatise certain moments involving the disaster, the performance from the cast kept the film from straying too far into unbelievable territory. Mark Wahlberg, who also co-produced the film, gives a solid performance in the lead role of Mike Williams, as does Kurt Russell playing crew member Jimmy 'Mr. Jimmy' Harrell. After the explosion occurs, you can really feel the sense of panic and shock emanating throughout the characters as they try to deal with surviving far out in the ocean. Surprisingly, the film barely focuses much on the oil spill itself but rather on just the blowout and the explosion. I would have liked to have seen more emphasis on the aftermath of the spill rather than only on the destruction of the rig. Overall, the film is still a worthwhile tribute to all those on board who died and to those who tried to save their fellow co-workers on that fateful night in April.I rate it 7/10.",7,0,1,5 October 2016
It," One of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work to date
","IT is a horror drama film based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. Starring Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd in the title role, the film not only succeeds as a terrifying horror film but also as one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work to date.In 1989 in the town of Derry, Maine, a group of outcast kids known as the 'Losers Club', are each terrorised by a frightening, shape-shifting entity they collectively refer to as 'IT'. When no one else in town will come to their aide, the kids decide to band together and fight against 'IT' themselves while also overcoming their own personal demons.Like with comedy, horror is a highly subjective genre. What one may find scary may cause others to roll their eyes in annoyance. Thankfully, IT provides enough scares that seem as realistic as possible and prevent the film from being silly. This retelling takes itself very seriously and doesn't constantly rely on jump scares for legitimate horror, instead by building a creepy atmosphere of uncertainty and individual torment in each of the kids. The cast is fantastic, Bill Skarsgard's performance as IT, in particular that of his clown form Pennywise, is terrifying, almost on par with Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. He definitely feels like more of a threat than Tim Curry's version, whom by today's standards seems a little too goofy and wacky to be scary. In addition to Pennywise, all of the child actors are brilliant. Not once did I ever feel unconvinced of the fear that they were feeling. Even the usual Stephen King tropes seemed more subdued in this film, aside from the usual setting in Maine, of course. If this is the future for adaptations of Stephen King's work, then I am most certainly on board.I rate it 8.5/10",9,89,175,7 September 2017
John Wick," Does for Keanu Reeves what Taken and Harry Brown did for Liam Neeson and Michael Caine, respectively
","John Wick is a 2014 action thriller directed by Chad Stahelski and David Leitch. Starring Keanu Reeves in the title role, the film successfully revitalises Keanu Reeves' career and brings him back into the spotlight as an action hero.In New York City, retired assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves), mourns the death of his wife Helen to a terminal illness. Shortly after, John receives a puppy as per request of Helen to help him come to terms with her passing. One night, a trio of Russian gangsters break into John's home, beat him up badly, kill the puppy, and steal his car, after John refused to sell the car to their leader Iosef (Alfie Allen) earlier that day. Now with nothing left to lose, John vows revenge on the gangsters and comes out of retirement to settle the score once and for all.With a good amount of action, drama, and some cleverly choreographed shoot-outs, John Wick does for Keanu Reeves what Taken and Harry Brown did for Liam Neeson and Michael Caine, respectively. The filmmakers do a good job showcasing why the John Wick character is so feared, yet respected within the crime underworld of New York thanks mainly to Keanu Reeves' nuanced performance as the 'one man army' title character. Often times, I feel that Reeves' approach to his acting is very hit-and-miss, however here, it is most certainly a hit. The film's creative use of colour and lighting gives an almost anime and noir feel. There were many times where I could tell the directors must have watched several anime and kung fu films to serve as inspiration for the overall tone.I rate it 7.5/10",8,1,2,2 August 2017
Rocketman," A wild depiction of the rock n' roll lifestyle through the eyes of one of the most iconic musicians of all time
","Rocketman is a biopic about the life of legendary singer-songwriter Elton John. Starring Taron Egerton in the lead role, it is a wild depiction of the rock n' roll lifestyle through the eyes of one of the most iconic musicians of all time.Since he was a shy young boy, Reginald Dwight (Taron Egerton) has had a knack for playing piano by ear and decides to enrol at the Royal Academy of Music, a prestigious musical school that he hopes will nurture his talents. While there, Reginald believes he has what it takes to become a singer-songwriter, adopting the stage name 'Elton John' and signing an album deal with a major record company. Eventually, Elton John becomes world famous due to his outlandish live performances and catchy songs, making him one of the best selling music artists in history. However, all of this fame and fortune comes at a price, as Elton struggles with drug addiction, depression, the loss of friends, and his own sexuality.With its clever combination of musical numbers and topical subject matter, Rocketman is a must-see for any Elton John fan young and old. Even though the film does glance over a small amount of the musician's struggles at times, the audience is shown just enough to understand the pain he is feeling as he tries to come to terms with it. Taron Egerton gives a fantastic performance as Elton John, practically on the same level as Rami Malek playing Freddie Mercury in 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. He perfectly captures that signature flamboyance and visceral energy that made Elton so popular in the first place, while also showing his melancholy side when dealing with his problems off-stage. However, unlike 'Bohemian Rhapsody', this film does not water down the lead subject's rockstar lifestyle as we are shown most of his debaucherous acts of sex and drugs, which gives us a better look into why he was trying to nullify his own personal insecurities in the first place. Even to Elton John novices, this is one biopic worth checking out.I rate it 8/10",8,3,7,29 May 2019
A Star Is Born," Flawlessly showcases the immense talent of its two leads in both their acting and music
","A Star Is Born is a romantic drama film based on the 1937 film of the same name. Starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, it flawlessly showcases the immense talent of its two leads in both their acting and music.After another successful concert, famous country singer Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) stops by a bar for a drink where he witnesses a performance from Ally (Lady Gaga), a young waitress who dreams of becoming a singer-songwriter. Impressed by her musical abilities, Jackson decides to take Ally under his wing to help her rise up in the music industry, despite battling his own problems with drugs and alcohol.Anchored by its two captivating leads and its music, A Star Is Born may well go down as one of the greatest film remakes of all time. Every song is memorable and thanks to the brilliant sound design, the audience constantly feels like they are at a real concert whenever a track is played. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga have perfect on-screen chemistry. It is sheer joy to watch them sing together and act off one another throughout the film. Despite her glamorous and artsy image, Lady Gaga's outstanding performance as Ally is raw, down-to-earth, and should be highly relatable to any up-and-coming musician who may be watching, which, in turn, perfectly shows her versatility as both a singer and an actress. Bradley Cooper (who directed, co-wrote, and produced the film as well) was also fantastic as Jackson and in addition to singing his own songs, he leaves just as much of an impression as Lady Gaga, but never so much that it feels as though he is overshadowing her. This is a remake for the ages and most certainly needs to be experienced on the big screen in surround sound.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,1,3,18 October 2018
Darkest Hour," A mostly enjoyable, easy-to-follow biopic about one of the most important political figures of the twentieth century
","Darkest Hour is a biographical war drama starring Gary Oldman as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Directed by Joe Wright (Atonement, Pride and Prejudice), it paints an interesting picture of the controversial but influential leader during a crucial moment in the history of Europe.In 1940, Western Europe is at war with Nazi Germany, who are on the brink of invading Belgium and the Netherlands. Meanwhile in Britain, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) is forced by the Conservative Party to resign, and his successor is announced to be Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman), a man most members of parliament do not see eye-to-eye with. Churchill's unorthodox and eccentric ways of conducting politics cause much irritation among his fellow ministers, and he must now swallow his pride to decide whether to negotiate with German leader Adolf Hitler or continue to fight on.Featuring one of Gary Oldman's greatest performances, which is saying a great deal considering the many terrific roles he has played throughout his career, Darkest Hour is a mostly enjoyable, easy-to-follow biopic about one of the most important political figures of the twentieth century. The transformative makeup effects on Oldman and his perfect line delivery constantly make us feel as though we are watching the real Churchill on-screen and not some cheap imitation. Unfortunately, the film itself feels somewhat uneven at times, as it does not juggle the personal life and political life of Churchill as successfully as it should. There were moments where the film dragged due to inconsistent editing and poorly paced scenes that did not lead anywhere. However, Oldman's depiction of the celebrated world leader is fantastic enough to continue watching and thankfully counteracts most of the film's serious flaws.I rate it 7/10",7,0,3,11 January 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A worthy entry in the series and fitting appetizer before the release of Episode VIII
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a standalone spin-off film in the Star Wars franchise. Proving once again that Star Wars in good hands at Disney and that Star Wars: The Force Awakens wasn't a fluke, the film serves as a worthy entry in the series and fitting appetizer before the release of Episode VIII.Sometime after the events of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, the evil Galactic Empire are in the process of building their ultimate super-weapon, The Death Star, as a means to control the galaxy. In an effort to stop them, the Rebellion recruits Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) to work alongside them to steal the blueprints for the Death Star and find a way to use them to put a stop to the Empire's expanding domination of other star systems.Succeeding not only as a Star Wars film, but as an exciting heist film, Rogue One is highly entertaining and stands on its own from the series it originated. I especially enjoyed the effort the filmmakers went to make the film look as much like the Original Star Wars Trilogy as possible, complete with convincing practical effects and even some amazing CGI effects. Hardcore Star Wars fans should keep their eyes peeled for some clever Easter eggs and inside references to other Star Wars films. My only real complaint is that the first act is a bit slow moving. However, the brilliant third act more than makes up for it.I rate it 8.5/10",9,3,13,15 December 2016
Captain Marvel," An enjoyable origin story and a well-suited lead in to Avengers: Endgame
","Captain Marvel is the twenty-first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the ninth film in Phase 3. Starring Brie Larson in the title role, it is an enjoyable origin story and a well-suited lead in to Avengers: Endgame.In 1995, Vers (Brie Larson), a powerful warrior for the Kree Empire, is suffering from nightmarish visions while training to take down the shapeshifting alien species known as the Skrulls, for which the Kree are at war with. During a later conflict, Vers is taken prisoner by the Skrulls but manages to escape to Earth with them in hot pursuit. Upon crashing into a Blockbuster Video, Vers attracts the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), who question her about the reason why she has come to Earth in the first place.With solid action and special effects, Captain Marvel is up to the usual standard of Marvel origin stories and once again continues to run with this winning formula. The fun 90s aesthetic is often played for laughs, such as the fashion, music, and technology of the time, and depending on the generation watching this film, it will either make you laugh or cringe. What stood out the most to me though was the impressive de-ageing of Samuel L. Jackson as the younger Nick Fury. One would swear that the filmmakers used a time machine to bring the young Jackson back with them just for this movie alone. In addition to this, Jackson has great on-screen chemistry with Brie Larson, who does a fine job playing the titular new addition to the MCU cast, even if her character's traits feel somewhat like a retread of the previous cocky-turned-humble heroes (e.g. Tony Stark, Thor). Thankfully, the film does show her in moments of weakness to prove she is not too overpowered and has noticeable flaws like the rest. In spite of all this, I am still not entirely sold on her being the new face of the MCU, as I feel that she still needs time to properly prove herself alongside the other Avengers. As is always the case, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes, one of which is heavily related to Avengers: Endgame.I rate it 7.5/10",8,10,33,7 March 2019
Zootopia," Almost on par with Inside Out on how clever it can get
","Zootopia is the latest animated feature by Walt Disney Animation Studios. Even though the trailers weren't particularly exciting for me, I had been told it is excellent and worth seeing by just about everyone who had seen it. For the most part, I think they're right. I would say that it is almost on par with Inside Out on how clever it can get.Set in a world populated with anthropomorphic animals, a young rabbit cop named Judy (voiced by Ginnifer.Goodwin) is forced to work hand in hand with a sly con-artist fox named Nick (voiced by Jason Bateman) to uncover a conspiracy involving the mysterious disappearance of some of the 'predator' animals populating their city of 'Zootopia'.Despite the film's seemingly cute look, it delves pretty deep into some dark subject matter and themes such as discrimination, prejudice, class status and even attempted murder. However, it still manages to maintain that Disney family charm and never goes so far as to alienate younger audiences. The film's animation was great to look at and brightly coloured, and the world of Zootopia felt alive and vibrant. Jason Bateman, who I am used to seeing as a straight man in most comedies, was great as the wise cracking Nick, as was Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy. If you enjoy clever Disney films like Inside Out, then I recommend seeing it.I rate it 8.5/10",9,8,15,29 March 2016
Last Flag Flying," A solemn and occasionally humorous story of three reunited friends and their ways of dealing with the effects of PTSD
","Last Flag Flying is a comedy-drama film directed by Richard Linklater (Boyhood, School of Rock) and based on the novel of the same name by Darryl Ponicsan. Starring Steve Carrell, Bryan Cranston, and Lawrence Fishburne in the lead roles, it is a solemn and occasionally humorous story of three reunited friends and their ways of dealing with the effects of PTSD.In 2003, Doc (Steve Carrell), a Vietnam War veteren, meets up with his fellow soldiers Sal (Bryan Cranston) and Mueller (Lawrence Fishburne). Doc reveals that his only son has been recently killed in the Iraq War and that would like the two of them to accompany him in bringing the body home for a proper burial. Sal accepts right away but Mueller is reluctant due to his new lifestyle as a clean-cut Reverend, but after some persuasion by his wife, the two join Doc in his lengthy journey back home.Well-acted and carefully paced, Last Flag Flying is a respectable film about the effects of war on those who fought in it without the need to actually show the war itself. Each of the three lead actors did a fine job, in particular Bryan Cranston, who is responsible for some much needed comic relief during the film's more depressing moments. The film's simple plot allows for some engaging dialogue between the three friends to be real cause for holding the viewer's attention and, as a result, we are given an interesting look into the mindset of each of the three veterans and how they each cope with the post-war trauma, whether it's through light-hearted comedy or by following Christian principles laid out in the Bible.I rate it 7/10",7,4,6,23 August 2018
Us," Proves that Peele is one of modern cinema's most unique, interesting filmmakers and that Get Out was certainly no fluke
","Us is a horror film written, produced, and directed by Jordan Peele (Get Out). Starring Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke, it proves that Peele is one of modern cinema's most unique, interesting filmmakers and that Get Out was certainly no fluke.33 years after a traumatic childhood incident, Adelaide Thomas (Lupita Nyong'o) travels with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two children Zora and Jason (Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex) to their family holiday house in Santa Cruz, California. Late one night, the family are visited by a group of four people who stand menacingly out front of the driveway. After Gabe fails to make them leave, the four people break into the house and reveal to the family that they are their exact doppelgängers, albeit, wearing red clothes and brandishing large pairs of scissors.Much like Get Out, Us is a slowburner horror film, relying on building a tense and foreboding atmosphere during the first and second acts, resulting in an explosive conclusion. Similar to how Get Out had flashes of David Lynch influences, Peele's clever use of cinematography and symbolism in Us has strong allusions to the work of Stanley Kubrick, in particular his 1980 film 'The Shining'. Each of the main cast were terrific playing both their regular characters and their frightening doppelgängers, in particular Lupita Nyong'o. What one can expect next from the brilliant and unique mindset of Jordan Peele is anyone's guess, though I am already on board at this point.I rate it 8.5/10",9,3,5,28 March 2019
Knives Out," One of the most ridiculously entertaining murder mysteries to grace cinema screens in a long time
","Knives Out is a whodunit mystery film written and directed by Rian Johnson (Looper, The Brothers Bloom). Starring Christopher Plummer, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Ana de Armas, it is one of the most ridiculously entertaining murder mysteries to grace cinema screens in a long time.One day after celebrating his 85th birthday with his dysfunctional family at his large mansion, renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead in his study room. The police are soon called to the scene to investigate the causes of Harlan's death and to determine if foul play was a factor in all of this. Joining them is the famous private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), who has his own unconventional methods of figuring out the situation, much to the chagrin of the other Thrombey family members.With its slick production values and witty dialogue, Knives Out injects so much quirky energy into what is widely considered to be an archaic genre and successfully modernises it as a result. Writer/Director Rian Johnson, who clearly has an affinity for this type of movie, takes a great amount of influence from the work of Agatha Christie, with the singular setting and oddball characters rounding off what would normally considered a surface level murder mystery. In addition to this, Johnson detracts from the usual European vibe of the genre to give the film a considerably more American feel, reminding his audience that the genre is universal and not necessarily restricted to a particular continent or culture.There is so much beautiful visual flair in this film. Each scene felt articulately laid out with such clever use of colour and symmetry. One part of the film's set involves an expensive looking seat with a plethora of knives surrounding it in a circular pattern, which can catch the viewer off guard during some important scenes. This again feels like a callback to the whodunits of decades ago, which implemented the surroundings into the story, making the audience question whether or not certain things played a role in the murder itself.Every character was used brilliantly throughout the story, with each one serving a purpose no matter how minor it seemed. All of the family members have a reason to be involved in Harlan's death and deducing who has the strongest involvement kept the film moving along at a brisk pace. However, to single out too many characters would give away the ending so I will only single out one: Daniel Craig. Craig is clearly having a wonderful time playing Benoit Blanc, who can only be described as a southern US Hercule Poirot. At first, Blanc seems like a total goofball with a funny accent but the further the story advanced, the more it felt like he was a figure the audience could trust at solving this mystery.In conclusion, while whodunits may seem dead to some, thanks to the efforts of Rian Johnson, there is proof that there is still so much enjoyment to be had. Even veteran viewers of the genre may be surprised at some of the twists the film throws at them. I urge modern audiences to give it a chance, whether you care for these types of films at all. You never know how much you may end up liking it in the end.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,9,27,28 November 2019
The Irishman," An exceptionally well-made depiction of one man's ascendance through the ranks of organised crime that only the collaboration of its renowned director and cast could pull off
","The Irishman is a crime drama film directed by Martin Scorsese based on the non-fiction book 'I Heard You Paint Houses' by Charles Brandt. Starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino, it is an exceptionally well-made depiction of one man's ascendance through the ranks of organised crime that only the collaboration between its renowned director and cast could pull off.In Philadelphia in the 1950s, Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) works as a truck driver delivering goods to shops all around the city. One day, Frank decides to do some delivery work for the local Italian-American mafia as a means to provide extra income for his family. Eventually, Frank is accused of theft by his company but is let off the hook thanks to the efforts of union lawyer Bill Bufalino (Ray Romano). Bill later introduces Frank to his cousin Russell (Joe Pesci), head of a northern branch of the Philadelphia mafia, who recruits Frank to do some tough jobs for him, including being a hitman if necessary. Over time, Frank gains notoriety and respect among mafia members and affiliates, including the popular union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), who becomes a close personal friend of his.Epic in both scale and storytelling, 'The Irishman' never wanes in holding the viewers' attention thanks to the creative efforts of director Martin Scorsese. Much like his previous mafia-related work 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino', Scorsese carefully and meticulously uses every moment of the film's long runtime (209 minutes to be precise) to help the audience get to know each character and their motivations in full detail, never once boring them in the process. Few filmmakers could make a movie in this way but if there are any, Scorsese would be high on the list.At times, I felt strangely nostalgic for this craft of filmmaking, which is a rare occurrence today. The film offers nice on-location sets, creative production design to reflect each decade, and almost no CGI whatsoever (apart from some de-aging used on the lead actors). This is a pure dramatic experience from beginning to end that a modern audience may not get to enjoy all too often. I wish more filmmakers would consider re-embracing this style for their future projects.In addition to this, all of the lead actors did a fantastic job, being the usual Scorsese heavy-hitters (the only one missing would be Ray Liotta). Robert De Niro gives his finest performance in years as Frank Sheeran, a man who ultimately who just wants to survive in this unfair world. This felt like a return to form for De Niro, a far cry from the abundance of mediocre comedy films he has starred in recently. It is also great to see Joe Pesci again, this being his first notable film role since Lethal Weapon 4 all the way back in 1998, and despite all that time, his acting skills are still as strong as ever. Al Pacino is also a joy to watch, being one of those actors who will chew the scenery in every film his is in, no matter how it may turn out. However, I felt that Harvey Keitel was underused, with his character only appearing in a handful of scenes. This is a shame as I believe there was potential he could have been just a memorable as the rest of the cast, had he been used more frequently.Overall, any fan of Scorsese or this classic style of filmmaking will find plenty to enjoy in the director's latest outing. I do feel that newcomers to his work may be put off by the film's three-and-a-half hour runtime, but if anyone can handle binge-watching an entire season of a Netflix show in one day, then this shouldn't feel too much different. To quote Roger Ebert; 'No good movie is too long and no bad movie is short enough'.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,1,4,5 December 2019
Creed," The best of the Rocky sequels
","Creed is a sports drama film which is essentially the seventh movie in the Rocky film series. Not only is it a solid entry into the series but it also stands on its own as a great sports movie. So far, I consider it the best of the Rocky sequels, which is saying a lot.Adonis Creed Johnson (Michael B. Jordan), the illegitimate son of former heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed, is a young man who dreams of becoming a professional boxer. After some unsuccessful attempts of making big in his hometown of Los Angeles, Adonis travels to Philadelphia, where he meets up with Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), the friend and former boxing partner of his father. Although reluctant at first, Rocky takes Adonis under his wing and trains him to become a heavyweight champion boxer, following in his father's footsteps.Filled with great boxing fight scenes, Creed is respectful to its source material and contains the right amount of heart and emotion. Michael B. Jordan gives a great performance in the lead role, you can really tell he's worked hard to make his character convincing. However, Sylvester Stallone steals the show as an older Rocky Balboa. It's fascinating seeing this character whom was once the student become the teacher. I would not be surprised if his performance earns him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards.I rate it 8.5/10. If you're a fan of the Rocky film series, definitely give this one a watch.",9,3,11,26 November 2015
Spotlight," A damning and shocking look at the hypocrisy of one of the world's biggest religious organisations and the people who were brave enough to expose them
","Spotlight is a drama film starring Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Liev Schreiber. Based on the true story of the Boston Globe's uncovering of child sex abuse by Catholic priests, it is one of the best acted dramas I have ever seen. It is a damning and shocking look at the hypocrisy of one of the world's biggest religious organisations and the people who were brave enough to expose them.In early 2001, the Boston Globe's group of investigative journalists, known as 'Spotlight', work tirelessly around the clock to uncover the recent child molestation cover-ups involving priests at the local Catholic Churches. During their research, the group discover that these cover-ups may go back even further than they had originally thought, even to the Vatican itself.Well acted and well-written, Spotlight handles its dark subject matter very carefully. It would have been easy to exaggerate the heroic nature of the group of journalists but instead they are shown as regular people who want nothing more than a sense of justice. The cast were all fantastic, Mark Ruffalo in particular gives one of the best performances of his career as Michael Rezendes, as do Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams and Liev Schreiber.I rate it 8.5/10.",9,2,3,5 May 2016
Aquaman," Gives the DC Extended Universe the much needed push it has needed for some time
","Aquaman is the sixth installment in the DC Extended Universe. Starring Jason Momoa in the title role, it proves that DC films are experiencing a resurgence and will likely prove to be healthy competition with Marvel.One year after the events of Justice League, Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa) learns he is heir to the throne of Atlantis, an underwater kingdom populated by sea life and humanoid lifeforms known as the Atlanteans. However, Arthur's place as king is challenged by his half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who intends to invade the surface world and reclaim it back for the ocean. Being half-human and half-Atlantean, Arthur must try to stop Orm from succeeding in his genocidal plan and give Atlantis the ruler it deserves.High spirited and likeable, Aquaman thankfully gives the DC Extended Universe the much needed push it has needed for some time, similar to how Wonder Woman did in 2017. There is a comfortable balance between comic relief and serious drama, but never so much that it feels like it is ripping off or downright plagiarising its style from Marvel. In terms of plot, the film feels like a hybrid of Thor and Black Panther, and its only major issue is that the story occasionally becomes muddled in its exposition scenes which does affect the pacing at times. Jason Momoa is without a doubt the perfect actor to play the titular hero, as he effectively elevates the character beyond being the laughing stock he has been among comic book fans for many decades. His scenes with Mera (Amber Heard) were great fun to watch and were the source of some of the film's more lighthearted moments. Willem Dafoe was also used well and wasn't merely reduced to being a cameo, and in addition to this, it was quite unusual to see him play a good guy in a comic book film. Be sure to stay back for an important mid-credits bonus scene.I rate it 7.5/10",8,1,3,26 December 2018
Deadpool 2," A fun and hilarious sequel to the original
","Deadpool 2 is the sequel to the 2016 superhero film Deadpool starring Ryan Reynolds in the title role. Directed by David Leitch (John Wick and John Wick: Chapter 2), it is a fun and hilarious sequel to the original, thanks in part to Reynolds' lively performance.Two years after the events of the first film, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), still going by his alter-ego 'Deadpool' continues to live out his days as a mercenary travelling around killing the bad guys. One day, Deadpool is forced to form a team of superheroes known as the 'X-Force' to protect a mutant kid from a dangerous futuristic time-traveller named 'Cable' (Josh Brolin).Although lacking some of the freshness of the original, Deadpool 2 is a worthy sequel in just about every sense. The meta-humour and fourth wall breaks still hit home when they need to and the action scenes are expertly choreographed by John Wick co-director David Leitch, taking over from Tim Miller. Once again, there is no doubt that Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool. His comic timing is perfect and even some of the character's most dramatic scenes can be taken seriously in the right context. However, it is Josh Brolin who shines the most. He nails the role of Cable and he holds his own without drawing too many comparisons to his recent performance as Thanos. Be sure to stay during the credits for two hilarious bonus scenes.I rate it 8/10",8,6,18,16 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," A much needed jolt of life that was lacking greatly in its two predecessors
","Thor: Ragnarok is the third standalone Thor movie and the fifth film in Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople), this installment gives the Thor films a much needed jolt of life that was lacking greatly in its two predecessors.Two years after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) finds himself imprisoned on a distant planet where he is forced to do battle in a gladiatorial duel against his former friend, The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Meanwhile, Thor's home realm of Asgard is under attack by the powerful Hela (Cate Blanchett), who plans to bring it to an end during the oncoming apocalyptic event known as Ragnarok.Considering how bleak and serious the first two Thor films were (mainly the second film), Thor: Ragnarok thankfully takes a different route by injecting more humour and colour into the story to become one of the most fun and entertaining films in the MCU to date. All of the film's comedic moments worked well, and didn't feel as though they were just inserted for the sake of generic comic relief. Another issue I feel is that the original two focused too much on Loki (Tom Hiddleston), making us forget that Thor was supposed to be the main character. Thankfully, Loki, while still having an important and amusing role in the story, is merely a supporting character and Thor himself is given the proper development needed to move the film along nicely. As with all films in the MCU, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.I rate it 8/10",8,53,96,26 October 2017
Ready Player One," A thrilling and fast-paced experience that only a director like Spielberg could handle so well
","Ready Player One is an action adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. Based on the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline, it is a thrilling and fast-paced experience that only a director like Spielberg could handle so well.In a dystopian 2045, the world has become hugely overpopulated and derelict. As a form of distraction from the real world, many use an online virtual reality software known as the OASIS where they can live out their fantasies using an anonymous avatar to interact with other 'players'. One particular player, teenager Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), uses the OASIS to escape his boring life in the slums of Columbus, Ohio. After Jim Halliday (Mark Rylance), the creator of the OASIS dies, he leaves behind one final challenge for players to find three cryptically hidden keys which will grant them his entire fortune and full ownership of the OASIS itself. Wade enlists the help of some of his friends to find the keys before an evil conglomerate corporation can do so for themselves.In the hands of a lesser director, Ready Player One could have easily been a mindless mess of pop culture references and nostalgic gaming imagery, but thankfully with Steven Spielberg at the helm, the film manages to work remarkably well in its own right. Rather than revel in its own self-referential nature, the film for the most part keeps its nostalgic allusions to a minimum, though admittedly it is still fun to pick out anything recognisable at times. Multiple viewings may be required to spot everything. The fast-paced action and narrative allow the film to feel much shorter than its actual running time of 140 minutes and the story never drags. The film itself serves a commentary on humanity's over-reliance on using technology to escape reality from both a positive and a negative perspective. The one major problem I felt was that some of the important supporting cast were underdeveloped and during the third act, this becomes annoyingly obvious. Within a few years, I am almost certain that Ready Player One will achieve cult status among gamers and film fans alike.I rate it 8.5/10",9,0,4,29 March 2018
The Hateful Eight," Not quite on par with some of Tarantino's better movies, but still a worthy entry into his expanding filmography
","The Hateful Eight is a Western film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. While it's not quite on par with some of his better movies, it's still a worthy entry into Tarantino's expanding filmography. It's filled with all the directorial trademarks one would expect from his movies.During the cold winter of Wyoming, some time after the American Civil War, a bounty hunter and his prisoner take shelter in a cabin with a group of strangers to avoid an oncoming blizzard. Throughout the course of the night, an awkward tension starts to build as it becomes evident that not everyone is who they claim to be.This film contains all of the typical Quentin Tarantino movie elements. It has brutal violence, dry one liners and some creative cinematography. Samuel L. Jackson once again gives a memorable and bad-ass performance, as do Kurt Russell and Walton Goggins. My only real gripe with the film was that the pacing at the beginning was very slow. I guess it was to showcase the tense atmosphere building up, but I feel that this could have been accomplished through alternate means. Overall, if you're a fan of Tarantino's work, then I recommend seeing it.I rate it 8/10.",8,4,12,20 January 2016
"I, Tonya"," A no holds barred, tongue-in-cheek look into the life of the titular skater and the infamous legacy she has left behind
","I, Tonya is a biographical film about controversial figure skater Tonya Harding. Starring Margot Robbie in the lead role, it is a no holds barred, tongue-in-cheek look into the life of the titular skater and the infamous legacy she has left behind.Since the age of 4, Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) had been forced into the sport of figure skating by her abusive and domineering mother, LaVona (Allison Janney). As she grows older, Tonya becomes one of America's greatest figure skaters and attracts a whole legion of fans along the way due to her bold and brash personality. While training one day, Tonya meets Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), and the two start dating and eventually marry, against LaVona's wishes. However, their marriage is rife with physical and verbal abuse against each other, and over time this takes its toll on Tonya's abilities as a skater.The film portrays its subject in a surprisingly sympathetic light. We, the audience, are shown that a great deal of Tonya Harding's actions and personality traits are not entirely her fault, but that of the people she was unfortunate to have been surrounded by. Margot Robbie gives a career-redefining performance as the title character, hopefully putting an end to any doubt that she cannot play serious roles like this due to being considered too 'beautiful' or 'glamorous'. However, Allison Janney stands out as Tonya's tyrannical mother, who is clearing exploiting her daughter's fame and fortune for her own personal gain, much like many of today's 'pageant moms' .I rate it 8/10",8,1,1,25 January 2018
Molly's Game," A solid directorial debut from the veteran screenwriter
","Molly's Game is a biographical drama film based on the memoir of the same name. Written and directed by Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing, A Few Good Men, The Social Network), it is a solid directorial debut from the veteran screenwriter and yet another interesting look into the mindset of a real-life individual.In the early 2000s, Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) an aspiring skier, dreams of making it big in the 2002 Winter Olympics. After sustaining a serious injury to her spine, Molly decides to take a year off and move to Los Angeles. While there, Molly lands a job as the office manager for a real estate developer named Dean (Jeremy Strong), who also holds underground poker games with many rich and famous individuals. Molly helps Dean out by appealing to his poker players and in doing so, makes large sums of money from tips alone. Eventually, Dean feels that Molly has become too independent from him and he fires her, leading her to decide to run her own underground poker games.Right from the get-go, the film draws its audience into the world of its titular character. The rapid-fire dialogue, a trademark of Sorkin's style, immediately helps us get to know Molly's motivations and aspirations in life and what makes her so intriguing in the first place. Sorkin's directorial style is somewhat reminiscent of Edgar Wright, with its quick-cut editing and brisk pace and his approach to telling this story in particular feels like how Martin Scorsese did with The Wolf of Wall Street. Jessica Chastain gives one of the best performances of her career as Molly Bloom. Her delivery of some of the film's best lines is perfectly on point and feel natural coming from an actress like her. Idris Elba is also worth noting as Molly's lawyer, Charlie Jaffey, a man equally as fascinated by her life story as the audience itself.I rate it 8/10",8,2,5,1 February 2018
Moana," A nice addition to Disney's 3D animated film library
","Moana is a CGI musical animated film from Walt Disney Animation Studios. Featuring the voices of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Temuera Morrison, and newcomer Auli'i Cravalho, it is a nice addition to Disney's 3D animated film library and a fun journey of self-discovery.On the small Polynesian island of Motunui, Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), the daughter and heir of the island's chief, lives in harmony with her fellow inhabitants. One day, Motunui is struck by a terrible curse brought on by the Demigod Maui (voiced by Dwayne The Rock Johnson), which causes food and vegetation to become scarce. Determined to fix this, Moana departs from the island to search for Maui to help her in accomplishing this task.Despite containing some of the typical Disney tropes and clichés, Moana manages to feel fresh and vibrant, thanks in part to its huge heart and likable charm. I particularly enjoyed the nice blend of the Polynesian culture, which includes those of Samoa, Hawaii, and New Zealand. The film is very beautiful to look at and the visuals can be stunning at times. The songs, in particular, 'You're Welcome', are catchy and compliment the film quite well, and never feel annoying or as if they were written specifically to win awards, unlike a certain song from another Disney film about letting go. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is amusing as Maui and he certainly projects enough of his good-naturedness into the role. However, it is newcomer Auli'i Cravalho who stands out the most, mainly due to how well written her character happens to be.I rate it 8/10",8,0,2,16 August 2017
BlacKkKlansman," A confrontational and highly effective 'Joint' by the veteran director
","BlacKkKlansman is a biographical drama film co-written and directed by Spike Lee. Based on the non-fiction book 'Black Klansman' by Ron Stallworth, it is a confrontational and highly effective 'Joint' by the veteran director.In 1972, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) is hired as the first African-American detective at a Colorado Springs police department. Initially given menial tasks around the police station, John decides to branch out and requests to work as an undercover agent at a local Ku Klux Klan rally. Fully aware that the KKK would never accept a black man into their organisation, John suggests the idea of using his co-worker, white Jewish police officer Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), to pretend to be him when meeting with other Klan members in person, while still maintaining verbal contact over the phone.As ingenious as it is aggressive, BlacKkKlansman is easily one of Spike Lee's best films in years and a solid commentary on society's views on racism in America. As to be expected, Lee does not hold back in showcasing the racial epithets and slang used against African Americans. However, he also chooses to juxtapose this with an extreme depiction of black nationalism in certain scenes, and this brings something of a balance to the overall story and makes it seem less biased. The acting between the two leads John David Washington (Denzel Washington's son) and Adam Driver is fantastic and it helps to make what may have been considered a farfetched plot had it not been a true story seem so believable. If one can stomach some of the more extreme scenes of racism and injustice, then this 'Joint' is certainly worth the time to watch and discuss afterwards.I rate it 8.5/10",9,10,20,16 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Captures the lighthearted spirit of the titular hero while also keeping it closely in line with the other recent Marvel films
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is the second reboot of the Spider-Man franchise and the fourth film of Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Tom Holland in the eponymous role, this film captures the lighthearted spirit of the titular hero while also keeping it closely in line with the other recent Marvel films.Eight months after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is still attending high school while living with his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). Using the specially designed suit given to him by Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Peter continues to fight crime in his local neighbourhood in Queens, New York while juggling his school life. One day, Peter uncovers an illegal weapons plot led by Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton), and despite being warned not to get too involved in major affairs, decides to step in and stop Toomes before it's too late.Filled with all the fun and excitement one can expect from a Spider-Man film, and indeed, a Marvel film in general, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fast-paced ride from start to finish. I especially enjoyed how despite being primarily a collaboration with Sony, the film still felt very much like the Disney-owned Marvel properties. Tom Holland is young and witty in the lead role, as was previously seen in Civil War, however this time he isn't merely reduced to a scene-stealing supporting role. Michael Keaton, as to be expected, gives a convincing performance in the villainous role of Vulture, this being the third winged character he's played in his career (after Batman and Birdman of course), and thankfully isn't forgettable. As is the case with most Marvel films, be sure to stay back for a post-credits scene, because this one in particular I found hilarious.I rate it 8/10",8,2,10,6 July 2017
Suicide Squad," Despite some plot holes and a somewhat generic villain, Suicide Squad is overall a pretty enjoyable film.
","Suicide Squad is the third film in the DC Cinematic Universe. Even though I still had doubts as to whether it would be any good, considering the lukewarm feelings I have for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, this film is a big improvement. So far, I consider it the best of the three films in DC's Extended Universe.Months after the events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, government official Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles a team of apprehended supervillains to undertake dangerous missions in exchange for lighter prison sentences and clemency. These supervillains include expert marksman Deadshot (Will Smith), former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Elise Robbie), fire manipulator El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Australian assassin Boomerang (Jai Courtney), and the reptilian Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje).While the film suffers from a poorly edited and choppy first act, as was also the case with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad has such a fun, manic vibe to it that it is hard for me to dislike. I feel that the best scenes involved Deadshot's backstory and Harley Quinn's fall from grace as a respected criminal psychiatrist. However, it is Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker that was the biggest surprise for me. His chilling take on the role fits the film's aesthetic perfectly. The soundtrack was great too, which included music from Queen and The White Stripes. Despite some plot holes and a somewhat generic villain, Suicide Squad is overall a pretty enjoyable film.I rate it 7/10.",7,6,12,4 August 2016
Doctor Strange," A surreal but interesting look into the psyche of the title character
","Doctor Strange is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comic Book of the same name. Although I wouldn't consider it a Top 10 film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I still found it to be a highly enjoyable origin story. Along with Guardians of the Galaxy, this film wasn't afraid to take risks or stray too far from the typical Marvel superhero formula.Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon, is involved in a car accident that seriously damages the nerve endings in his hands. With his career now ruined, Strange sets out for Nepal, where he heard a paraplegic learned how to walk again. While in Nepal, Strange meets the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), a mysterious person who runs a society of loyal followers tasked with defending the Earth from evil inter-dimensional threats. Intrigued by the possibility of unlocking his full potential, Strange undergoes a lengthy training process with the Ancient One to become a master sorcerer.Perhaps the most thought-provoking of the Marvel films, Doctor Strange is a surreal but interesting look into the psyche of the title character. Benedict Cumberbatch feels like he's giving it his all in the lead role and even his American accent wasn't too bad, although it is far from perfect. Mads Mikkelsen also gave a solid performance as the film's villain Kaecilius, who didn't just seem like a generic bad guy wanting to take over the world. However, Tilda Swinton steals the show as the Ancient One, Her spiritual lectures in the film really struck a chord with me. The visual effects were fantastic, strongly reminiscent of Inception and 2001: A Space Odyssey. So far, I'd say it's the most visually gorgeous looking film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I look forward to seeing the Doctor Strange character in the future Avengers film.I rate it 8/10. Like with just about every Marvel film, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.",8,7,14,27 October 2016
Interstellar," Spellbinding
","Interstellar is a science fiction film co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Inception, Batman: The Dark Knight etc.) and starring Matthew McConaughey. I found it absolutely amazing, rarely do I use a word like 'spellbinding' to describe a movie but I really do feel like Interstellar is well worthy of it. Matthew McConaughey was excellent as well. He really shows the great emotional range he has as an actor.The story is about a group of explorers, led by former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who embark on a journey through a newly discovered wormhole near the planet Saturn. Their main mission is to save humanity from extinction by an environmentally devastated Earth.The film was not only beautiful to look at, but it was very well written too. However, like with Inception, you REALLY need to pay attention to pretty much everything that happens to fully understand what is going on. It's difficult for me to go into too much detail without giving away important plot points so you'll just have to see for yourself.I rate it a very high 9.5/10 and I highly recommend it to any fan of Christopher Nolan and anyone who enjoys intelligent science fiction. I personally consider it one of the best and most thought provoking science fiction films I've ever seen.",10,2,3,5 November 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," One of the cleverest and best written films of its genre in several years
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a black comedy murder mystery starring Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, and Woody Harrelson. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths), it is quite possibly one of the cleverest and best written films of its genre in several years.In the small town of Ebbing, Missouri, divorced mother Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) grieves over the murder of her daughter Angela several months earlier. Fed up with the way local authorities are handling the investigation, Mildred decides to take matters into her own hands and rent out three abandoned billboards near her home to try and find the culprit herself.Featuring well-balanced comedy and drama, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a highly entertaining and amusing film, which also serves as a commentary on police ineptitude and vigilantism. The film's screenplay crackles with wit and clever humour, which helps move the story along at a brisk pace. Frances McDormand is superb as Mildred Hayes, a character so well written it is practically impossible not to cheer for her whenever she is onscreen. This is easily her best role since Fargo, which this film feels like something of a spiritual sequel to, due to its Coen brothers-esque tone. Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson also gave great performances as the local police trying but failing to find who killed her daughter. Despite their incompetence, the two are still likeable for the most part and we feel their frustration while searching for the culprit.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,2,5,3 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A real mixed bag of a conclusion with much to enjoy and express frustration about
","Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker is the third installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy and the ninth and final chapter of the 'Skywalker saga'. Directed by J.J. Abrams, it is a real mixed bag of a conclusion with much to enjoy and express frustration about.As has been the case for both 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi', I will not be providing any kind of synopsis, as I feel it would give away potential spoilers. The only thing I will say is that it takes place one year after the previous film and leave it at that.While there is still that trademark Star Wars fun to be had, The Rise Of Skywalker often feels unsure of itself at the most crucial of times. At the very beginning, the audience is shown several different interwoven stories at such a breakneck pace that it becomes overwhelming to take in all this information at once. It seems as though the filmmakers are trying to squeeze in as much material as possible to make up for all this lost time. I believe most of these plot elements would have been better off explored throughout the previous two films, which would have lead to a better structured conclusion than what we ended up with.Director/co-writer J.J. Abrams, who returns after successfully bringing the sequel trilogy to life with 'The Force Awakens', tries his best to conclude the saga on the most enjoyable note possible. However, considering how much this film's predecessor, 'The Last Jedi', apparently deviated from his original vision, that appears to have been easier said than done. Several surprises and twists felt like after thoughts and don't inspire awe like those seen in previous entries of the series. In spite of this, Abrams still does manage to provide fanservice to longtime viewers, some of which were clever yet subtle references to other films.Most of the characters felt relegated to secondary roles, with few standing out as little more than just to help the plot along. This is particularly annoying as we have been treated to their development through each of the previous two films only to have them brushed aside to make way for its lead characters instead. With that said, Daisy Ridley still remains the standout as Rey. It is her convincing acting that holds the audience's attention as we watch Rey work hard to discover who she truly is in this galaxy far, far away.Overall, even though The Rise Of Skywalker may not be the epic conclusion to this decade long saga that everyone may have anticipated, I'd say it does end things in a satisfactory manner. Since Star Wars is literally a religion to some people, several viewers are going to love this film or hate it no matter what. As long as we steer clear of the toxic animosity shown in the aftermath of 'The Last Jedi', this film and the rest of the sequel trilogy could provide an interesting topic of discussion for many years to come.I rate it 6.5/10",7,2,14,19 December 2019
American Sniper," Bradley Cooper gives another memorable performance in the title role
","American Sniper is a war drama starring Bradley Cooper and directed by Clint Eastwood. I found it well acted and cleverly directed as well. Bradley Cooper gives another memorable performance in the title role.The film is a biopic about real life Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper). As a young boy, Chris learned all of his sniping skills from his father by hunting deer. Now an adult, he decides to put them to good use by joining the US Navy. After the 9/11 attacks, Chris is sent over to Iraq to serve alongside his fellow soldiers and while over there, he manages to kill 255 people, making him the deadliest marksman in US military history. However, in doing so, he ends up saving many of the lives of his fellow men and even some other innocent Iraqis. As a result, he is considered a hero by his country and earns the nickname 'Legend'. Upon returning home from the war to his wife (Sienna Miller) and two children, Chris is still traumatised about the events of the war and feels like he will never be able to adjust to normal everyday life.Bradley Cooper's performance carries the film. He was very convincing in the leading role. Clint Eastwood's direction is very good as well. He manages to blend real life events with cinema very effectively. Even though some of the war scenes tended to drag at times, they never felt forced or glorified. However, due to some of the violence, this is not a film for the weak-hearted.I rate it 7.5/10",8,12,16,23 December 2015
Lion," This film shows that no matter where we are in this world, we cannot escape who we really are
","Lion is a drama film starring Dev Patel based on the true story of Saroo Brierley. Touching and heartwarming, this film shows that no matter where we are in this world, we cannot escape who we really are.In 1986, a young Indian boy named Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is separated from his family while out one day with his older brother. After surviving on the streets of Calcutta for some time, Saroo is eventually taken to an orphanage where he is later adopted by an Australian couple named John (David Wenham) and Sue (Nicole Kidman). At first, Saroo is weary of his new adoptive family, but over time, he warms to them. 25 years later, the older Saroo (Dev Patel), still haunted by visions of his childhood, decides to search for a way to reconnect with his birth family, whom he believes are still waiting for him.Surprisingly, the film depicts more of Saroo's backstory in India than his actual search for his family, which is fine as this allows the audience to feel what he has been missing out on for so long. Dev Patel's portrayal of a young man searching for his birth family was fantastic and reminiscent of his role in Slumdog Millionaire. Nicole Kidman only really shines in one short scene, although it certainly leaves an impression on the viewer.I rate it 8/10",8,0,0,23 February 2017

It serves as a fitting conclusion to Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Set months after the events of Avengers: The Age of Ultron, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a burglar who is down on his luck in terms of finances breaks into the house of a wealthy man and steals a strange looking suit from his highly secure vault. However, unbeknownst to Scott. the suit and house belong to Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who designed the suit to shrink in scale but increase its users' strength. Pym tracks down Scott, and takes him under his wing to train Scott to use the suit effectively. With the help of Pym's daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Scott eventually becomes the superhero known as Ant-Man. Scott's training is now complete, and the three of them must now plot a heist that will save the world from a new, powerful enemy.The film manages to be both hilarious and emotionally deep in all the right places. There were plenty of really funny moments that don't weigh down the film's serious tone to any extent. Paul Rudd, with whom I'd originally had doubts as to whether he could properly play a superhero, pulls off the lead role pretty effectively, even if he does occasionally lapse into his Judd Apatow-style comedic persona. However, the biggest surprise was Michael Douglas as Hank Pym. He felt like he fit more into the Marvel Cinematic Universe better than any other actor in the film. I also enjoyed how his character played a more significant role as a mentor, rather than just a generic background helper.I rate it 8/10.",8,4,10,15 October 2015
Bohemian Rhapsody," A solid and well-told biography of the famous singer brought to life by a spectacular performance from Malek
","Bohemian Rhapsody is a biopic about the life of Queen frontman Freddie Mercury. Starring Mr. Robot's Rami Malek in the lead role, it is a solid and well-told biography of the famous singer brought to life by a spectacular performance from Malek.In 1970, young Pakistani British Farrokh 'Freddie' Bulsara (Rami Malek) aspires to be a successful singer/songwriter. One day, Freddie approaches the band 'Smile' after their lead singer quits and asks to replace him. Despite their reservations, the band recruits Freddie and begin to start performing with him across various pubs and colleges in London. One year later, the band has become world famous after Freddie decides to change the group's name to 'Queen' and his own name to 'Freddie Mercury'.Energetic and touching at times, Bohemian Rhapsody does a superb job of showcasing how one extremely talented yet imperfect man helped transform a small London band into one of the hugest and best-selling rock groups in history. Rami Malek's performance as Freddie is simply flawless, even more so than what Sacha Baron Cohen could have ever been. Malek perfectly embodies and emits just the right amount of swagger and flamboyance Freddie was best known for beyond simply physically resembling him. There were even times where he indistinguishable from the real man. The music, as to be expected, was amazing, and being a longtime fan of Queen, I had to resist the urge to sing out loud in a cinema full of people. The film's depiction of the band's 1985 LIVE AID performance at Wembley Stadium is so realistic one would swear they were actually in the audience. While some purists may complain that the film follows the typical biopic formula and does little to derive from it, I feel that this does not diminish the overall entertainment quality too much and I recommend filmgoers see it on their own terms and decide for themselves.I rate it 8.5/10",9,1,3,1 November 2018
Baby Driver," A quintessential example of Edgar Wright's work
","Baby Driver is an action comedy film starring Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Bernthal. Directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World), this film is a quintessential example of the popular director's work.In Atlanta, Georgia, a young and talented getaway driver calling himself 'Baby' (Ansel Elgort) is forcibly employed by a mysterious heist kingpin known only as 'Doc' (Kevin Spacey). Baby has serious tinnitus due to his involvement in a car accident as a child which killed his parents, which he drowns out with music from his iPod. One day, Baby is recruited into one ill-fated heist, which, as as he expected from the beginning, requires him to take matters into his own hands to protect both himself and those he cares about.With fast-paced editing, breathtaking car chases, memorable characters, and the best retro soundtrack since the Guardians of the Galaxy films, Baby Driver is definitely a worthy entry in Edgar Wright's filmography and features all of the director's hallmarks. What the film lacks in comedy, it more than makes up for in sheer action and fun. The cast was perfect, Ansel Elgort is likable and fun to watch as the title character, you can't help but cheer him on as he pulls off some of the most creative car chase scenes since Mad Max: Fury Road. Kevin Spacey also gives a Frank Underwood-esque performance as Doc, menacing, yet, compelling. However, I believe that Jon Bernthal was underused and should have been more involved in the story, as he doesn't play as big of a role as was previously thought.I rate it 8.5/10",9,1,4,13 July 2017
Justice League," Feels more like a Marvel film rather than a DC film, which is both a good and a bad thing
","Justice League is the fifth installment in the DC Extended Universe superhero franchise. Directed by Zack Snyder, the film shows that along with Wonder Woman, DC may be experiencing something of a resurgence in 2017, but still has a fair way to go before they have truly caught up with Marvel.A short time after the events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck), along with his ally Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), decide to form a group of heroes to combat a new enemy. This team, in addition to Bruce and Diana themselves, includes Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a superhuman with aquatic abilities, Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller), a young man who can move at super fast speeds, and Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher), a cybernetically reconstructed former athlete with the ability to manipulate technology.Fast paced and generally lighthearted, Justice League feels more like a standard Marvel Cinematic Universe film rather than an actual DC film, which is both a good and a bad thing. It's good because it allowed the film to be more entertaining and fun with its action and humour, and it's bad because it doesn't exactly feel original in that sense. I believe Joss Whedon is the one responsible for this different approach. The musical score, composed by Danny Elfman, was quite impressive, almost as though he was referencing his days of composing for Tim Burton's Batman films. The villain, Steppenwolf, was nothing more than another forgettable CGI bad guy with generic world domination tendencies, which is pretty much on par with most early Marvel villains. The new heroes were introduced reasonably well, but it felt as though their proper backstories are being shelved for their upcoming solo films. Aquaman and The Flash provide some decent comic relief during some fight scenes but Cyborg felt somewhat underused. Like with Marvel films and unusual for a DC film, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.I rate it 7/10",7,3,9,15 November 2017
The Revenant," Amazing cinematography and one of Leo's best performances to date.
","The Revenant is a Western drama film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. Directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu (Birdman), it features some amazing cinematography and one of Leo's best performances to date.In 1823, a group of trappers and hunters are searching for pelts in the unsettled wilderness of Louisiana. One of the group's lead hunters, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) stumbles upon a mother grizzly bear and her two cubs. Glass is then brutally mauled by the bear and is mortally wounded in the attack. Glass is left behind to die by the rest of his hunting group at the suggestion of John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who claims that carrying Glass with them will only slow them down. However, Glass overcomes some of his minor injuries and slowly but surely attempts to make it back to civilisation.This film is violent, unnerving and sometimes hard to watch, so I don't recommend it to those with a weak stomach. However, if you feel you can handle it, I should also mention that the film is filled with beautiful cinematography and a sense of realism that is quite rare in motion pictures today. Leonardo DiCaprio gives another brilliant performance in the lead role. If he doesn't at least earn an Oscar nomination, then I will be very surprised. Tom Hardy was great as well, it's always satisfying to see him play villainous characters so well.I rate it 8/10.",8,1,4,7 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," One of Spielberg's best most recent movies
","Bridge Of Spies is a historical drama film starring Tom Hanks, co-written by the Coen brothers, and directed by Steven Spielberg. Even though its subject matter of the Cold War is something I know very little about, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am now more interested than ever to learn more about it. I rank it among the best of Spielberg's most recent movies.In 1957, tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War are at their peak. Spies from both the American CIA and Soviet KGB are a major threat to the security of both world powers and each side often resorts to hasty measures to stop any classified information from being leaked. In Brooklyn, New York, Rudolf Abel is arrested under the suspicion of being a spy. James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is assigned as Abel's defence lawyer. However the idea of defending a potential Soviet spy proves to be an unpopular and difficult task for Donovan. Meanwhile, over in the Soviet Union, an American spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down and captured by the KGB. As a means to ease tension between the two warring countries, Donovan proposes a swap between the two prisoners of war, Abel for Powers.Despite containing barely any action scenes and being almost entirely made up of talking, the film never feels boring or slow paced. This is most likely due to the Coen brothers' clever screenplay and Steven Spielberg's creative direction. There were many suspenseful moments where it felt like the prisoner negotiations would go horribly wrong and that kept me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hanks also gives another memorable performance as James B. Donovan, once again proving his versatility as an actor.I rate it 8.5/10.",9,103,141,28 October 2015
Split," Not a complete redemption for Shyamalan's filmmaking credit but certainly a step in the right direction
","Split is a psychological thriller film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and starring James McAvoy. While not a complete redemption for Shyamalan's filmmaking credit, it is certainly a step in the right direction.After attending a birthday party, three girls named Casey, Marcia, and Claire are kidnapped by a mysterious man identifying himself as 'Dennis' (James McAvoy) and are held in a prison-like basement. While trying to escape, the girls discover that 'Dennis' is actually one of 23 distinct personalities belonging to the man in question, and is conspiring with a fellow personality to aid in the release of a frightening 24th, known only as 'The Beast'.Suspenseful and often chilling, Split feels like a much needed return to form for the once disgraced writer/director. Shyamalan successfully channels the Hitchcockian method of storytelling that was present in his early films. As one would expect, there is a twist ending but unlike Shyamalan's recent duds, this one actually works quite well. James McAvoy gives a frightening, deranged performance as a man suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and he never overacts or hams up the unhinged nature of his character. Shyamalan still has a long way to go before he fully redeems himself of his recent terrible films but if Split is anything to go with, he's definitely on the right track.I rate it 7.5/10",8,5,15,12 April 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The best Spider-Man related film Sony Pictures have made in years without Disney's help
","Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is an animated superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie, 21 Jump Street), it is quite easily the best Spider-Man related film Sony Pictures have made in years without Disney's help.In New York City, teenager Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) is bitten by a radioactive spider and reluctantly becomes the new Spider-Man after Peter Parker's incarnation suffers a terrible fate at the hands of Kingpin/Wilson Fisk (voiced by Liev Schreiber). However, one day, Miles meets several other variants of Spider-Man and soon discovers that he isn't the only version of the iconic hero to exist within the bounds of reality. With Kingpin's new plan about to be set into motion, the group of alternate reality Spider-Man-type heroes must work together to stop the evil mastermind before it's too late.Fast-paced, action-packed, and fun, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is just the type of Spider-Man film Sony Pictures has needed to have made for some time. The film superbly emphasises that anyone can be a superhero, no matter your age, race, size, gender, or even species for that matter. Unlike previous films, which often became cluttered with conflicting plot elements and an overabundance of villains, this one actually manages to find balance in its narrative and thankfully kept things consistent with just one main villain. In addition to this, it was great fun seeing the different versions of Spider-Man interact with each other, especially during the final stand-off with Kingpin. I just wish there were more scenes like this throughout the film as unfortunately most of this was saved until the very end. The animation style perfectly suited the comic book style storytelling the film was going for, right down to the on-screen onomatopoeia and inner monologues. The voice acting was great too, including a humorous performance from Nicolas Cage as a 1930s noir Spider-Man, as well as a posthumous cameo from Stan Lee. Being a Marvel film, be sure to stay after the credits for an amusing bonus scene.I rate it 8/10",8,6,27,13 December 2018
Dunkirk," A near perfect look into the mindset of a soldier in the midst of wartime chaos
","Dunkirk is a war film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, The Prestige). Based on the real-life Dunkirk evacuation of World War II, the film further proves that Nolan is one of the best living directors and cements his legacy as a brilliant, unique filmmaker.In 1940, over 400,000 allied British and French troops stationed on the beaches of Dunkirk in France find themselves surrounded by German troops. With the enemy closing in fast, the allied troops desperately try to find ways to escape across the English Channel to the safety of the British mainland.Despite its limited dialogue, the film offers a near perfect look into the mindset of a soldier in the midst of the wartime chaos. Not since Saving Private Ryan has a film so effectively pulled this off. The unnaturally loud and piercing sound of bullets and gunfire evoke feelings of fear and panic in the viewer, giving off the impression that they too are on the battlefield. The audience is given real sense of a race against time (time being a recurring theme in several Christopher Nolan's films) thanks in part to Hans Zimmer's fantastic, yet, minimalist score. There's not a single moment in this film that does not elicit suspense or tension in the viewer. Christopher Nolan's creative use of cinematography perfectly showcases the desperation of the soldiers in their need to escape. Overall, I consider Dunkirk not only among the director's all time best films, but one of the best war films period. I rate it a very high 9.5/10",10,5,12,20 July 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The best X-Men film yet
","X-Men: Days of Future Past is the seventh X-Men film and the sequel to X-Men: First Class. I can say it's hands-down the best X-Men film yet, both expanding the main plot of the franchise and fixing most of the mistakes that some of its predecessors had made. Bryan Singer, who directed the first two X-Men films, returns for this installment, taking over from Matthew Vaughn.The story focuses on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) being sent back to 1973 by Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) to team up with their younger selves (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender respectively), who are still at odds with each other after events of the previous film, and urgently change history from an event that will threaten the very existence of both humanity and mutants.The action packed moments were very well handled and the dramatic scenes were particularly poignant, especially the parts with Professor X and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). There was also one hilarious scene involving the mutant Quicksilver, which had me in stitches.I rate it 9/10.",9,0,0,21 May 2016
Captain America: Civil War," A dark and emotional chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","Captain America: Civil ͏Wa͏r is the first Marvel superhero film of 2016 (second if you count Deadpool). Last year, I said that Avengers: Age of Ultron was the darkest and best Marvel film so far, however, after seeing Civil War, I think we have a new contender. It represents a dark and emotional chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.After the Avengers fail to stop a terrorist plot in Nigeria, a superhero regulation act is set up by the United Nations that restricts the heroes from taking matters into their own hands. The team is divided over whether or not they should go along with this act or protest its restrictions. Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is strongly against it while Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) strongly supports it. This causes a major rift in the team and could possibly bring an end to the Avengers initiative altogether.So far, this is the darkest, most emotional and best acted film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I feel that it covered a lot more ground than Avengers: Age of UItron and gave the heroes a more solid reason to fight one another, unlike in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Despite its darker tone, there were still some hilarious scenes of comic relief throughout the film, mainly from Ant-Man and Spider-Man. The new heroes were all great as well; Chadwick Boseman was bad-ass as T'Challa/Black Panther and newcomer Tom Holland was youthful and witty as Peter Parker/Spider-Man.I rate it 8.5/10. Just like with most other Marvel films, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.",9,8,15,28 April 2016
Jackie," An interesting look into the life of an iconic woman
","Jackie is a biopic about Jackie Kennedy, the former First Lady of the United States. Starring Natalie Portman in the title role, the film is an interesting look into the life of an iconic woman who was something more than the mere wife of the American President.In the aftermath of her husband President John F. Kennedy's assassination, former First Lady Jackie Kennedy (Natalie Portman) agrees to an interview with a magazine journalist. Throughout the interview, the mourning Mrs. Kennedy discusses how she deals with the grief of losing her husband, the consoling of her children in their time of need, her own faith in God, and the impact her husband's Presidency will leave on history.Natalie Portman embodies the role of the First Lady with just as much dignity and poise as the real person. This is easily her best acting performance since Black Swan. However, the film's sub par production values and script make it seem more like a History Channel docudrama rather than an actual Hollywood movie. I just wish the film would have explored more of Jackie's life after she had overcome her bereavement rather than just this one moment.I rate it 7/10",7,0,1,19 April 2017
Inside Out," A strong return to form for Disney Pixar.
","Inside Out is the latest animated feature film by Disney Pixar. After their previous three movies (Cars 2, Brave and Monsters University) failed to impress me, naturally my expectations were quite low. However, this worked to my advantage because I can say that this is one of the best films they have ever made. It represents a strong return to form from the legendary animation studio.Riley Anderson is a young girl who lives a happy life with her loving parents and friends in Minnesota. Guiding her through life are Riley's personified emotions; Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. However, at the age of eleven, Riley and her parents relocate to San Francisco after her father finds a new job there. This change in location and atmosphere comes as a shock to young Riley and her emotions desperately try to help her cope with living in a new city, going to a new school and trying to make new friends, with sometimes disastrous results.This is one of the most clever, poignant, touching and original films that Pixar have made to date. I loved the concept of how the emotions in our heads know what is best for us and are trying to navigate us through life. Also, its moving story about acceptance and change will strike a chord with anyone who has moved someplace different and have tried to fit in and adjust to a new life. I would even rank it alongside Up and the Toy Story films in terms of how emotional it can get. My only real issue is that some of the film's themes may be too complex for really young viewers but I guess as long as their parents are with them to explain some of the more difficult to understand concepts then there shouldn't be a problem.I rate it a solid 9/10.",9,14,46,15 October 2015
Yesterday," A fun, sweet-natured film that truly does bring to light how much impact The Beatles have left on the world
","Yesterday is a fantasy comedy written by Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually). Directed by Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours, Trainspotting), it is a lighthearted romp brought to life by some great music and acting performances.Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is a struggling musician from a small town in England whose dreams of making it big are beginning to fade. One night, the entire world experiences a twelve second blackout and during this time Jack is struck by a bus and is later hospitalised. Upon being discharged, Jack is astonished to discover that he is now the only person on Earth who remembers The Beatles and their music. Using this to his advantage, Jack starts passing off Beatles songs as his own to assist him in becoming the famous rockstar he always wanted to be.Even though it doesn't quite achieve the satirical edge it hopes for, Yesterday is still a fun, sweet-natured film that truly does bring to light how much impact The Beatles have left on the world, whether we realise it or not. The film has a distinctly British flavour and it's unlikely it will appeal to international audiences, where some of the more subtle eccentricities may go right over their heads. The overall premise is similar to the 2006 TV series 'Life On Mars', where the main character is hit by a vehicle and transported to an alternate timeline, although this film is considerably more comedic in tone. Danny Boyle seems like an odd choice of director for a film like this, but he does a pretty good job carrying this unorthodox subject matter the whole way through. All of The Beatles songs featured are used perfectly during the film's big musical moments, and are expertly performed by newcomer Himesh Patel in the lead role. Surprisingly, a supporting appearance from Ed Sheeran of all people provided some of the film's funniest moments, as he proves to have solid comic timing. While not a must-see on the big screen, this film would certainly be worth a watch upon home release.I rate it 7/10",7,1,4,27 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," A near-perfect conclusion to the infinity saga and a brilliant culmination of 11 years worth of films
","Avengers: Endgame is the fourth Avengers film, the sequel to Avengers: Infinity War, and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by the Russo brothers, it is a near-perfect conclusion to the infinity saga and a brilliant culmination of 11 years worth of films.Following the events of Avengers: Infinity War, half of life in the universe has been wiped out after the intergalactic dictator Thanos (Josh Brolin) acquired all six infinity stones and snapped his fingers. In the aftermath of this horrific act, the last surviving Avengers bound together to come up with a plan to attempt to undo Thanos' actions whatever the cost may be.As emotional as it is entertaining, Avengers: Endgame concludes just about everything on a high note while at the same time opening doors to new exciting possibilities. Despite the film's three hour runtime, every minute is used carefully and thanks to the solid direction of the Russo brothers, it is never boring. Each important hero is used to their full extent and the audience is constantly reminded why we have invested so much in their character development after all this time. For anyone who has been following the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the past 11 years, this will most certainly not disappoint. Unlike previous Marvel films, there are no post credits scene to stay back for.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,4,14,24 April 2019
Toy Story 4," A sequel that I never knew we needed, but am definitely glad was made
","Toy Story 4 is the fourth film in the Toy Story series and Pixar's 21st film overall. Directed by Pixar storyboard artist Josh Cooley and featuring the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, it is a sequel that I never knew we needed, but am definitely glad was made.Two years after the events of Toy Story 3, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz (voiced by Tim Allen), and the rest of Andy's former toys have adjusted to their new lives with their current owner Bonnie. However, over time, Bonnie has neglected playing with Woody in favour of the other toys, and this causes him to reminisce over his old friend Bo Peep (voiced by Annie Potts), who was sold off to a mysterious buyer several years ago. One day, Bonnie brings home a new toy she made out of a plastic spork named Forky (voiced by Tony Hale), who believes that being played with is not his purpose but instead is merely 'trash'. After Forky and the rest of the toys are taken on a roadtrip with Bonnie and her family, Forky runs away and it is up to Woody to find him before Bonnie discovers he is lost.As heartfelt as its predecessors, Toy Story 4 is one of the greatest unexpected sequels ever conceived and adds so much more to its already long lasting legacy. Just because the toys' time with Andy is over, does not mean that there aren't any more stories to be expanded upon. Anybody who thought Toy Story 3 could not be topped with its touching ending needs to think again. This ending was so poignant that it reportedly reduced Tom Hanks and Tim Allen to tears while they were recording for Woody and Buzz, respectively, and it is easy to see why after watching. The vocal performances of these two veterans certainly hasn't dulled over the past 24 years and they sound as lively as ever, alongside newcomers to the series. This film also features the vocal talents of comedians Key & Peele as the hilarious stuffed toy duo Ducky and Bunny, who provide some great comic relief, as well as Keanu Reeves voicing Duke Caboom, a toy Canadian stuntman struggling with his own personal insecurities. In addition to all this, the beautiful animation and use of colour truly shines this time around and it shows how far Pixar have come since their feature film debut with the original Toy Story back in 1995. Will there be a Toy Story 5 in the near future? As this film has proven, we just may end up needing one after all.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,7,26,20 June 2019
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Just as wonderful as the original
","How to Train Your Dragon 2, the sequel to the How To Train Your Dragon (obviously), the animated film which came out in 2010. I consider it a great sequel, just as wonderful as the original, making it another Equal Sequel. I really enjoy sequels that expand on the first film's story rather than just rehash the original's plot, and this film does just that.Set 5 years after the events of the original, the Viking Hiccup and his friends are now young adults who have since made peace with the dragons and live in harmony with them in their village. Hiccup and his dragon Toothless now often go on adventures together, exploring new lands and territories. One day, the two of them discover a cave made of ice that is home to many new wild dragons and the mysterious Dragon Rider. Upon this discovery, the two end up in the centre of another conflict between humans and dragons, which they attempt to resolve.This sequel was a bit darker than the first one, but it still retains the charm and wonder that the original had going for it. I really liked how it showed another way that humans can be the real evil monsters and not the dragons themselves. Hiccup is a lot wiser and more determined than he was before, and that made the resolution much more satisfying to see.I rate it 8.5/10 and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loved the original.",9,5,8,24 June 2016
The Favourite," An odd take on one particular British monarch's legacy and the ones who served her
","The Favourite is a period drama directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster, The Killing of a Sacred Deer). Starring Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, and Rachel Weisz, it is an odd take on one particular British monarch's legacy and the ones who served her.In the early 1700s, Britain is at war with France and the British Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) sits upon her throne taking advice on ruling from her loyal adviser Sarah Churchill, the Duchess of Marlborough (Rachel Weisz). However, one day Sarah's broke cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) shows up looking for work and catches the attention of the Queen. Over time, Abigail gains the Queen's favour and is promoted as her personal attendant, much to the envy of Sarah, who feels she is being pushed aside for someone better.Well-acted and shot, The Favourite is an interesting yet strange film about an intense rivalry in 18th century England. Both Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz are appropriately catty and spiteful towards one another, and it is fun to watch how each one tries to outdo the other. Olivia Colman also shines as Queen Anne, clearly having fun playing up her character's eccentricities. The film has wonderful set pieces, much in the vein of Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon and Milos Forman's Amadeus, and one can certainly appreciate the effort that has been made to make the film look as authentic as possible. Unfortunately, though, the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a questionable ending. In terms of plot, there is not much shown other than the two servants vying for the Queen's attention and considering the film's two hour running time, this almost feels like a wasted opportunity for some showcase of the war between Britain and France. In addition to this, the film is a slow burner, not becoming particularly engaging until about twenty minutes in. It is understandable why this has little mainstream appeal and most audiences will be put off by its slow start, but overall, the film is still worth seeing for the solid performances of the three lead actresses and the eye catching set design.I rate it 7/10",7,1,1,31 January 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," A celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun
","Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,265,634,25 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," One of the most ambitious and brilliantly made love letters to an important era of movie making and an instant classic from such a fantastic filmmaker.
","Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the ninth film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, it is one of the most ambitious and brilliantly made love letters to an important era of movie making and an instant classic from such a fantastic filmmaker.In 1969, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), once one of the biggest Western actors on TV, struggles to find work in Hollywood. As Rick laments his fading fame, his best friend and stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) also deals with his own problems as a result of apparent rumours of him murdering his wife. One day, Rick manages to land a role in a new Western series called 'Lancer', and while he attempts to impress the director with his acting abilities, Cliff is meanwhile uncovering some unsettling information about a group of hippies squatting at the compound of his old workplace.As fascinating as it is engaging, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood proves that nine films in, Tarantino can still amaze us with his unique style of storytelling and personal perspective of the world around him. His vast cinephilic knowledge frequently shines through as we see him check off just about every Hollywood trope without ever resorting to typical cliches. In addition to this, the ways in which Tarantino immerses his audience in the free-spirited era of 1960s America is a sight to behold. His choice of soundtrack, the witty dialogue, the clever use of cinematography, and even the special effects of inserting modern actors into films of that time (similar to Forrest Gump) felt seamlessly accomplished. Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are in perfect sync with each other, being that they are both actor and stuntman respectively, so much so that it is virtually impossible to come to a conclusion as to who gave a better performance. Margot Robbie is worth noting as well as Sharon Tate, the young actress married to director Roman Polanski who was also struggling to be taken seriously in Hollywood. Her portrayal is respectful and thankfully Tate's real-life fate is not used for cheap entertainment thrills. This film is a must-see not only for Tarantino fans but also for anyone with an undying appreciation of cinema in general, much like Tarantino himself.I rate it a very high 9.5/10",10,26,42,15 August 2019
Gone Girl," One of the best mystery films I've ever seen
","Gone Girl is a mystery thriller film starring Ben Affleck and directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network etc.), based on the novel of the same name. It was excellent, one of the best mystery films I've ever seen. It was very well paced and kept my attention the entire time. Ben Affleck was great too. I think it's safe to say he's well and truly redeemed himself by now.The story focuses on a man named Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), whose wife Amy (Rosamund Pike), amid their failing marriage and losing both their jobs, suddenly goes missing one morning. Due to the amounting evidence against him and the way the media portrays him, Nick quickly becomes the prime suspect for her disappearance.As I mentioned previously, Ben Affleck was great in this movie. It showed the potential he has to be a good Bruce Wayne/Batman in the upcoming Batman VS Superman film. The direction by David Fincher was excellent as well. All of his director's trademarks were there, from his silhouetted dimly lit scenes to his ambient musical score composed by Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails.I rate it 9/10. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys mystery films and the work of director David Fincher.",9,2,6,6 August 2016
Get Out," If David Lynch and the Coen Brothers collaborated to make a blaxploitation comedy, with a dash of horror for good measure
","Get Out is a horror comedy written and directed by Jordan Peele. One of the cleverest movies of its genre I have ever seen, it leaves an impression on the viewer thanks to its underlying social satire and great performances from its cast.Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya), a young African-American man, travels with his Caucasian girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) to meet her parents at their wealthy family estate. While there, Chris makes himself at home but soon discovers that not everything is as normal and orderly as it seems on the surface.The film is essentially a slow burner, the plot doesn't become especially engaging until about halfway through the second act. However, this is all worth it for the highly satisfying conclusion that has been building up the entire time. Most of the film's characters, on the other hand, are interesting from the very beginning, particularly the protagonist Chris and his backstory. The quirky and surreal vibe of the film feels like if David Lynch and the Coen Brothers collaborated to make a blaxploitation comedy, with a dash of horror for good measure. Overall, writer/director Jordan Peele's debut effort is a great success and I look forward to seeing more of his films in the not-too-distant future.I rate it 8/10",8,10,18,3 May 2017
Aladdin," A fun live action update of the animated original, despite struggling to justify its existence
","Aladdin is a fantasy film based on the 1992 animated Disney film of the same name (itself based on the Middle Eastern folk tale 'Aladdin and the Magic Lamp'). Directed by Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Sherlock Holmes), it is a fun live action update of the animated original, despite struggling to justify its existence.In the city of Agrabah, Aladdin (Mena Massoud), a good natured street thief, is recruited by the Sultan's Grand Vizier Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) to search inside a cave for a mysterious magic lamp. Upon finding the lamp, Aladdin is betrayed by Jafar and is left die when he inadvertently frees the Genie of the Lamp (Will Smith). The eccentric Genie declares Aladdin his new master and tells him that he can grant him three wishes for just about anything, including the social status to marry the Sultan's daughter Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott).With its catchy music and nice setpieces, the live action Aladdin is a respectful update of the 1992 film, but unfortunately this is not nearly enough. Many years from now, it will be the original animated film people will be intending to see instead of this one. While some live action Disney remakes can bring something new and exciting to the story, such as Dumbo and The Jungle Book, this version of Aladdin does very little that has not been done before. The songs are the same, the plot is the same, and the character motivations are the same. The cast does a reasonable job, with Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott as Aladdin and Princess Jasmine, respectively working well together due to their believable chemistry. Will Smith also injects his trademark wittiness and likeability into his performance as the Genie, but never once does he come close to topping the late great Robin Williams. However, Marwan Kenzari seems too young to be playing Jafar, as this role would be better suited to someone closer in age to the Sultan himself, likely around middle age. The one thing I feel this film did somewhat better than the original is the romance between Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. The 1992 version went with the typical 'falling in love after one day' trope whereas in this one, the audience can actually feel their love blossoming over time. Aside from that, this remake is inessential for the most part.I rate it 6.5/10",7,2,6,26 May 2019
The Theory of Everything," Well made and often very moving
","The Theory of Everything is a biopic about world-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking and his first wife Jane Wilde Hawking. I really enjoyed it. It was well made and often very moving.The film covers most of the important moments in Stephen Hawking's (Eddie Redmayne) life, beginning with his courtship and eventual marriage to Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones), a literature student whom he met at Cambridge University. Over time, Hawking begins to lose control of his muscles and he is unable to use his hands and feet to accomplish even the simplest of tasks. The doctors diagnose him with motor neuron disease, an illness which causes the human body to slowly and permanently shut down the ability to move limbs but is told his brain will remain unchanged. He is given 2 years to live. In that time, however, Hawking starts a family with his wife and gives lectures at universities on his theories of black holes and the birth of the universe. Despite his condition getting worse and worse, Hawking still tries to see the positive side of life and even manages to write his famous book 'A Brief History Of Time', which becomes a bestseller.Eddie Redmayne's performance as Hawking was so convincing I often had to tell myself he isn't the real person. Felicity Jones was great as well as Hawking's loving and committed wife Jane Wilde. The love story between them always felt genuine and never forced.I rate it 9/10. I also recommend watching the 2004 TV movie 'Hawking' starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a companion piece for this film.",9,0,2,23 December 2015
The Lion King," A visually appealing, albeit pointless remake that adds almost nothing new
","The Lion King 2019 is a CGI photorealistic adaptation of the 1994 Disney animated film of the same name. Directed by Jon Favreau (Iron Man, Cowboys & Aliens, The Jungle Book), it is a visually appealing, albeit pointless remake that adds almost nothing new.In the African savannah, Simba (voiced by JD McCrary), a young lion prince, eagerly waits until the day he takes over as king from his father Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). One day, Mufasa is murdered by his jealous younger brother Scar (voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor), forcing Simba to flee his kingdom or face a similar fate. After covering a great distance, Simba meets a meerkat and warthog duo named Timon and Pumbaa (voiced by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen respectively), who take him in and teach him their carefree lifestyle. Eventually, Simba learns that he must take responsibility and reclaim his rightful place as king from his wicked uncle.While it does showcase some nice use of colour and cinematography, The Lion King 2019 offers little else worth recommending over its animated counterpart. The story is the same as the original, the songs remain unchanged, and even most of the dialogue is word-for-word identical. At best, director Jon Favreau is merely a conductor of someone else's symphony, a far cry from his work on 2016's The Jungle Book, which took risks and felt refreshingly new. In addition to this, the photorealistic CGI often had the film at a disadvantage as it fails to convey any real emotion from the animals. In the 1994 film, the animal characters were able to look a variety of different emotions due to the artistic freedom of it being animated as a cartoon, whereas in this film, each animal looks stoic whenever they're supposed to be sad or angry. Overall, to the small percentage of those who haven't seen the original, this film may be alright, however, all others should stick with the 1994 classic instead.I rate it 6/10",6,4,12,18 July 2019
The Elephant Man," A compassionate, tragic look into the life of one unfortunate yet fascinating intellectual
","The Elephant Man is a drama film based on the life of Joseph Merrick and starring John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. Directed by David Lynch (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet), it is a compassionate, tragic look into the life of one unfortunate yet fascinating intellectual.In 1880s London, surgeon Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) visits a carnival in his local area and stumbles upon a freak show as its most popular attraction. While there he discovers that the show's main exhibit is 'The Elephant Man' (John Hurt), a man with hideous birth deformities giving him an almost elephant-like appearance. Intrigued by this poor man's plight, Frederick rescues the so-called Elephant Man to learn more about his condition, only to discover that he is far more intelligent than his monstrous appearance suggests.Easily one of David Lynch's best films, The Elephant Man effectively paints a human portrait of the titular character and showcases him in the positive light he most certainly deserves. Despite being more linear than most of Lynch's work, the film still contains many of his directorial trademarks, including close-ups on eyes and flashes of surreal imagery. John Hurt gives a terrific performance in the title role and the makeup effects applied to his face were fantastic. Interestingly enough, this film helped serve as a catalyst for Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to introduce the 'Best Makeup' category at the Academy Awards.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,1,1,13 March 2018
A Quiet Place," Brilliantly suspenseful and acted
","A Quiet Place is a horror thriller film directed and co-written by John Krasinski (Jim Halpert from The Office). Starring Emily Blunt and Krasinski himself in the lead roles, it is a well-made highly effective film of its genre and a solid entry in Krasinski's directorial resume.In a post-apocalyptic 2020, the world is overrun by quick blind monsters that hunt their prey based on sound. One American family of four, a father (John Krasinski) a mother (Emily Blunt), their son (Noah Jupe) and deaf daughter (Millicent Simmonds), try to survive with what little resources they have, knowing that if they make even the slightest noise, the monsters will appear within seconds to shred them to pieces. Brilliantly suspenseful and acted, A Quiet Place invests its audience right from the very beginning and successfully manages to be frightening with its minimalist concept and setting. Due to the limited spoken dialogue, the story is cleverly communicated via small set-pieces such as newspaper clippings and calendars. John Krasinski proves himself as a capable horror director, breaking away from the comedic actor persona most have identified him with for some time, and the chemistry between him and his real-life wife Emily Blunt was always welcoming to watch during some of the film's more lighthearted moments. The child actors were excellent as well, particularly the deaf in real-life Millicent Simmonds playing the family's deaf daughter, which adds a strong sense of realism to her character. However, some small nitpicks prevent the film from becoming a true classic. For example, there is no explanation of why electricity still works for some people and how the news of the monsters spread worldwide without anyone attempting to figure out any possible weaknesses. That aside, the horror film is still worth one's time.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,3,8,5 April 2018
22 Jump Street," An Equal Sequel
","22 Jump Street is the sequel to the action-comedy 21 Jump Street, which came out in 2012. I found it to be a solid sequel, just as hilarious and action-packed as the original. The first film was easily the funniest film I saw in 2012. I was pretty much laughing the entire time and that's also the case with this film.The story involves police officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) once again going under cover as students, this time at a College rather than High School, to find the supplier of a drug known as 'WHYPHY' (an acronym for 'Work Hard Yes, Play Hard Yes' and pronounced like 'Wi-Fi'), which has killed another student. During the investigation, Schmidt hooks up with an art student and Jenko befriends a pair of athletic jocks, which puts a strain on their close friendship.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have great comedic chemistry, as seen in the previous film, but once again Ice Cube steals the show in every scene he's in. I really wish he'd do more harder comedy films like this, unlike those crappy Are We There Yet? family films. Even Ron Swanson himself, Nick Offerman, gets a few funny moments this time around.I rate it 8.5/10, the same score as the first film, making it an Equal Sequel. If you loved the original, definitely give this one a watch. But even if you haven't seen it, there's a recap at the beginning of this film to help you fill in the blanks.",9,1,3,21 June 2016
Call Me by Your Name," A beautifully told and often poignant story of forbidden love
","Call Me By Your Name is a drama film starring Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet. Based on the 2007 novel of the same name by Andrè Aciman, it is a beautifully told and often poignant story of forbidden love.In 1983, a young man named Elio (Timothée Chalamet) lives near a countryside town in Italy with his parents. One day, Elio's archaeologist father invites an American graduate student named Oliver (Armie Hammer) to stay with them over the course of the summertime to help out with his paperwork. During Oliver's six week stay, he and Elio bond over their mutual Jewish heritage and their emerging feelings for one another.Touching and melancholic, Call Me By Your Name never feels pretentious or forced in its showcase of love and romance and it leaves a powerful impression on the viewer right up to the end credits. Both Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet have great on-screen chemistry and director Luca Guadagnino does a superb job in showing their growing relationship throughout the course of the story. The film's cinematography is fantastic. We are often shown the glorious open Italian landscape, which serves as a great setting for some of the film's more dramatic moments. The soundtrack, which includes songs from musician Sufjan Stevens, is worth noting as well. Stevens' lyrics about personal longing and coming-of-age suit the film's tone perfectly and help project the viewer into the mindset of its two lead characters.I rate it 8.5/10",9,1,3,22 February 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," A solid entry into the series, but not on par with its two excellent predecessors
","X-Men: Apocalypse is the latest installment in the X-Men franchise and the third film in the rebooted series. While not on par with its two excellent predecessors, I still found it to be a solid entry into the series. However, I recommend seeing the original two films first.In 1983, the mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) awakens from a millennial-long sleep and vows to destroy mankind and take over the world. With the help of his Four Horsemen; Psylocke (Olivia Munn), Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Archangel (Ben Hardy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Apocalypse plans to create a world for mutants only. It is up to the X-Men, lead by Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), to work together and prevent Apocalypse and his team from succeeding.Filled with all of the explosive action and comic relief one would expect from the franchise, X-Men: Apocalypse unfortunately falls a bit short of being equally as good as the two great films that preceded it. The story would be hard to follow unless one has seen the previous films. With that said, I still really enjoyed the film for what it was. I particularly enjoyed the way that it expended on Magneto's story and showed how he just wants to be accepted for who he is, despite his mutant powers. I also really liked Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones) as the young Jean Grey. However, it is Quicksilver (Evan Peters) who steals the show in some of the funniest comic relief I have ever seen in a Marvel film. I can only recommend this film to those who have seen all of the previous X-Men Movies, if you haven't then I say watch them first.I rate it 8/10.",8,14,28,19 May 2016
Hidden Figures," A simple feel-good story that helps shine a light on the pivotal contributions of three overlooked heroes
","Hidden Figures is a historical drama film centred around the events of the space race in the 1960s. One does not need to understand the complex mathematical equations shown in this film to find it enjoyable. It is a simple feel-good story that helps shine a light on the pivotal contributions of three overlooked heroes.The film is based on the true story of female African-American mathematicians Katherine Goble (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe), who played important roles in NASA's space program in the early 1960s. Despite the discrimination and racial segregation occurring within this time period, the three African-American women manage to prove to everyone that they are more than capable of helping put astronauts into outer space.Despite its predictable outcome and some moments of sensationalism, Hidden Figures still feels nice to watch mainly because of the positive message it portrays; that no matter what opposition you may face, keep working hard to prove yourself and you will eventually earn the respect you deserve. The three African-American actresses all gave great performances. The segregated world of the 1960s is shown to full effect, as the three women endure prejudice and injustice, and as a result, the viewer can't help but cheer for them throughout their struggles.I rate it 7.5/10",8,3,10,22 February 2017
Coco," One of the most heartfelt and charming stories in Pixar's film library to date
","Coco is an animated fantasy film by Disney Pixar. Directed by Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 3), it is a touching story about the importance of family and tradition passed on from generations past.In a small Mexican town, a young boy named Miguel aspires to become a famous musician like the popular actor/singer Ernesto de la Cruz. However, due to a long-running ban on music enforced throughout his family, Miguel keeps his dream a secret from his relatives. On the night before the Day of the Dead festival, Miguel accidentally finds himself transported into the Land of the Dead, where he decides to seek out his great-great grandfather to help him return to the Land of the Living.While not quite as clever and humorous as other works from Pixar, Coco is certainly one of the most heartfelt and charming stories in their film library to date. The film does a fine job of showcasing some intriguing aspects of Mexican culture and family tradition in a quirky but respectful manner. There were several moments that felt highly reminiscent of the Studio Ghibli classic Spirited Away, with its fascinating depiction of the afterlife and the beings who make their home there. The animation, as to be expected, is visually gorgeous to look at and the Land of the Dead felt so vibrant and alive, rather ironically. The voice acting is solid, especially from newcomer Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel, but Benjamin Bratt also shines. These are the types of films Pixar should continue making for audiences and not sequels for the sake of merchandising and money, like the Cars series.I rate it 8.5/10",9,0,2,27 December 2017
1917," A raw, down-to-earth account of a significant moment in the First World War shown off with beautiful cinematography
","1917 is a war film co-written and directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Skyfall). Starring George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman, it is a raw, down-to-earth account of a significant moment in the First World War shown off with beautiful cinematography.During World War I on April 6, 1917, one section of the British army are informed that the Germans are faking a retreat as a means to ambush an attacking Battalion of more than 1,600 men. Since the Germans have cut all technological lines of communication, there is no normal way of letting the Battalion know that they are being led into a trap. Left with no other option, two young British soldiers Schofield (George Mackay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are tasked with delivering a handwritten warning letter to the Battalion, with whom the latter's brother is a part of. With time clearly not on their side, the two of them must carefully navigate through dangerous enemy territory to transfer the message before it is too late.Cleverly utilising both landscape and its actors to tell a compelling story, 1917 may be one of the most ingenious war films to grace cinemas in quite some time. Much like Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk before it, the film uses the backdrop of a World War to show how every second counts in just about all important situations. We are constantly on edge over whether or not these brave young men will survive any obstacles they are put through, from the rat-infested trenches of no-man's land to an eerily quiet abandoned farm. The theme of mateship is evidently shown throughout, with both soldiers ready to risk it all to defend each other in the face of these hardships.Co-writer/director Sam Mendes, who based this film on stories his grandfather Alfred told him as a child, brilliantly implements the work of acclaimed cinematographer Roger Deakins to give the impression that the whole thing is shot in one take. This puts the audience into the perspective of a World War I soldier, feeling all the claustrophobia of the cramped trenches and the shell shock of nearby explosions. There were several moments where I wondered how certain things would be shown to the audience without the need to cut away but each time the film amazingly found ways to do this. This is similar to Alejandro G. Inarritu's 2014 film 'Birdman' and Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 classic 'Rope', which were also edited to look like they were filmed in one continuous take. While there are apparently some hidden cuts at times, there is only one that is plainly obvious. I am intrigued to figure out where the other cuts are and repeated viewings should help in that regard.Relatively low-key actors George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman each do a fine job of carrying the film, much like their characters carrying the important message to the unsuspecting Battalion. The decision not to have big name actors in the lead roles works to the film's advantage, as it does not distract from the fact that these are supposed to be normal everyday soldiers who don't stand out in a crowd. With that said, more well known cast members like Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Andrew Scott make for welcome additions to the film playing minor but crucial supporting roles.In conclusion, while it may seem that the horrors of war have already been shown off enough by this point, the film proves that if it is told correctly, we can still be informed of how difficult things were for any soldier on the front line risking it all for not only his country but his fellow man. The sense of public duty and overall determination is a powerful thing, and at the end of it all, it is what keeps the human race going as a species.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,1,4,9 January 2020
Big Hero 6," Captures the best of both the Disney and Marvel worlds
","Big Hero 6 is a Walt Disney Studios animated film made in partnership with Marvel, based on the comic of the same name. I very much enjoyed it. I'll admit the trailers didn't really impress me all that much but to be fair this is a difficult film to make a trailer for. It really felt like it captured the best of both the Disney and Marvel worlds.Set in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo (San Francisco and Tokyo combined), 14 year old Hiro Hamada is a robotics genius who forms a team of superheroes to combat a masked supervillain from causing destruction. Aiding Hiro and his fellow heroes is the lovable robot Baymax, built by his older brother for personal healthcare and companionship.There was so much going on in this world the film has created. San Fransokyo felt alive and like a realistic city. Hiro is a likable protagonist and Baymax is such a fun character as well. He reminded me a bit of Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy, albeit, with a wider vocabulary than just saying who he is. This film also features probably my favourite Stan Lee cameo of all time.I rate it 8.5/10. Taking into account the Marvel side of the film, there is a post-credits sequence to stay back for.",9,2,4,27 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," One of the most emotionally heavy films in the entire Star Wars saga and easily one of the best in the franchise
","Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the second installment in the Star Wars sequel trilogy and the eighth 'Episode' in the overall series. Written and directed by Rian Johnson (Looper), it is one of the most emotionally heavy films in the entire Star Wars saga and easily one of the best in the franchise.As with Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I will not be posting any type of synopsis or mention of plot elements at this time, as discussing even the slightest moment could potentially spoil this entire film. All I will say is that it takes place shortly after Force Awakens and I will leave it at that.Like its predecessor, The Last Jedi does just about everything right in terms of storytelling and character development, a far cry from George Lucas's prequel trilogy. The acting is strong and packs just the right amount of emotional impact a Star Wars film should. Practical effects and on-location sets are shown more frequently and CGI is only used when absolutely necessary. One common criticism some had with Force Awakens was that it retread too many moments in other Star Wars films and felt unoriginal, however, in this film, there are several surprises and twists involving with some character's actions and their backstories that will likely come as a shock to many viewers. I still believe that the Star Wars series is in safe hands with Disney and I am already highly anticipating the release of Episode IX.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,5,30,14 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Action packed and very funny in places
","Guardians of the Galaxy is the second of 2014's Marvel action/superhero movies, the first being Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I really enjoyed it a lot more that I originally thought I would, considering the strange subject matter featuring a talking raccoon and a tree.The story focuses around Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), whom 26 years after being abducted from Earth, is thrown right into the middle of a conflict involving the possession of an orb which is being sought after by Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), a dangerous extraterrestrial supervillain. During this, Peter is forced to form an alliance with a group of alien misfits in order to prevent the orb from falling into Ronan's hands. The misfits are Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a green-skinned orphan woman, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a genetically engineered talking raccoon, Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) a tree-like humanoid and Drax The Destroyer (Dave Bautista (Batista) a butch warrior seeking vengeance against Ronan for murdering his family.The film started off kind of strange but it became better from the second act onwards. It was action packed and very funny in places. I particularly enjoyed the talking raccoon Rocket and his wisecracks. I would love to see him and Tony Stark having an argument in a future Avengers film. The soundtrack was excellent as well, filled with classic rock songs from the 70s and 80s.I rate it 8/10. Like with just about all of their films, there is one post-credits scene to stay back for.",8,1,5,6 August 2016
The Imitation Game," Benedict Cumberbatch gives possibly the performance of his career
","The Imitation Game is a historical thriller starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, based on the life of code-breaker Alan Turing. I found it very suspenseful and the subject matter was fascinating too. Benedict Cumberbatch gives possibly the performance of his career.Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a brilliant but socially awkward mathematician recruited by British Top Secret Intelligence to help crack Enigma, an extremely cryptic code created by the Nazi military during World War II. Enigma is considered impossible to decipher but Alan, along with his team of code-breakers, believe it can be solved, not necessarily by a lone human, but with a machine.Benedict Cumberbatch was fantastic in this movie. He really channels the way he plays Sherlock Holmes from Sherlock into his portrayal of Alan Turing. Keira Knightly was great as well as one of Turing's code-breakers Joan Clarke.I rate it 8.5/10.",9,3,4,23 December 2015
Jurassic World," A worthy sequel
","Jurassic World is the long awaited fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise. While nothing will ever be able to replicate the wonder and joy the original film brought, I can say that this one comes very close. It is a worthy sequel that makes you forget the mistakes that The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III had made.Twenty-two years after the events of the first movie, Isla Nublar has been revamped and redesigned into a properly functioning dinosaur-themed park named Jurassic World, as was originally envisioned by John Hammond. However, after 10 years in service, the park's popularity and tourism rates are declining. In an attempt to attract more tourists, the park's genetic engineers come up with a plan to introduce a new dinosaur, a hybrid Tyrannosaurus Rex known as the Indominus Rex. This idea backfires horribly when Indominus escapes its enclosure and goes on a rampage.This film gets right what its two predecessors got wrong. It manages to expand the fictional universe that Jurassic Park had started without seeming too contrived or forced. The characters were likable as well, especially Chris Pratt's character Owen Grady, a bad-ass, yet kindhearted raptor trainer. The third act alone redeems the franchise of The Lost Word: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. My only real complaint is that the CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) dinosaurs didn't always look very convincing. I guess CGI in the 80s and 90s looked better than the CGI of today.I rate it 8/10.",8,22,45,15 October 2015
Silence," A fascinating and thought-provoking piece of cinema from the veteran director
","Silence is a drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, and Liam Neeson. Based on the book of the same name, it is a fascinating and thought-provoking piece of cinema from the veteran director.In 1640, two Portuguese priests, Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver) travel to Japan to recover their mentor (Liam Neeson), who has been missing for sometime and is rumoured to have committed apostasy. Upon sneaking into Japan, where Christianity is strictly outlawed, the two priests attempt to preach Catholicism to some small villages, all while avoiding detection from local samurais.Whether one is deeply religious or not, this film leaves a lasting impression and will likely cause one to question their personal beliefs. I particularly liked the nice blend of Eastern and Western influences throughout the story, which adds to its intriguing tone. The Eastern parts seem reminiscent of director Akira Kurosawa's work and the Western parts feel like classic Hollywood. Despite its 161 minute running time, the film never feels boring or slow, mainly due to Scorsese's clever directorial techniques. This has been a passion project for the acclaimed director over the past 25 years and certainly shows. One can't help but notice the care and attention to detail he put into making this film.I rate it 8/10",8,1,4,15 March 2017
Logan," A fitting swansong for both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart
","Logan is the third and concluding film in the Wolverine trilogy and the final appearance of Hugh Jackman in the title role. After two mediocre solo films, this one more than makes up for their shortcomings. It is a fitting swansong for both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart.In the year 2029, an aging Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) lives in a hideout on the Mexican border caring for the elderly Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). To make ends meet, Logan works as a chauffeur around local towns in Texas. One day, a young mutant named Laura (Dafne Keen), who is being pursued by armed forces, suddenly turns up at Logan's residence and he is forced to come out of hiding to protect her at all costs.Dark, violent, and highly emotional, Logan is an appropriate ending to the long lasting Wolverine saga. Hugh Jackman once again gives it his all in the lead role. It's sad to know that this is very likely the last time we'll ever see him play this iconic character, but this film will certainly cement his legacy deep in our minds. Patrick Stewart, who also gives his final performance as Professor Charles Xavier, was great as well. One can't help but feel sad for this once great mind succumbing to the detrimental effects of old age and senility.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,0,5,2 March 2017

It manages to be action-packed, dramatic and even very funny in all the right places.After the Avengers lead a successful raid against a Hydra outpost, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) revives his secret peacekeeping program Ultron (voiced by James Spader) to help safeguard the planet from evil. However, Ultron interprets the idea of keeping Earth safe as a need to eradicate humankind from existence. Ultron shortly escapes from Stark's laboratory to act out its mission and it's up to the Avengers, along with their new allies, the twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) to stop Ultron from carrying out this genocidal act.Even though it is darker than the first film, Avengers: The Age of Ultron is still able to capture the charm and humour from its main characters that we have grown to love over the years. Tony Stark is still as witty as ever, delivering his trademark hilarious one-liners and Hawkeye's (Jeremy Renner) scenes have some of the most poignant moments in any Marvel film. But perhaps the biggest surprise were the twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who played a much more important role than I thought they would. There's rarely a dull moment.I rate it 9/10, a bit higher than its predecessor, which I rated 8.5/10.",9,25,50,15 October 2015
Hotel Mumbai," An intense, unrelenting look at this cowardly act of pure evil and the selfless heroism of those who tried to help
","Hotel Mumbai is a crime thriller film based on the Mumbai terrorist attacks of 2008. Starring Dev Patel, Armie Hammer, and Jason Isaacs, it is an intense, unrelenting look at this cowardly act of pure evil and the selfless heroism of those who tried to help.In late November 2008, a group of ten terrorists arrive in Mumbai, India by a small boat. Upon splitting up, the terrorists travel to various locations around the populated city to massacre as many innocent people as they can. After taking out several civilians in smaller locations, the surviving members of the group meet up at the luxurious Taj Mahal Palace Hotel to finish their act of terror. While they shoot their way through the hallways, the hotel's staff put their lives in the line of fire in an attempt to save as many guests as possible.As unflinching as it is jarring, Hotel Mumbai is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that successfully showcases the heroism of the titular hotel's brave staff members in an earnest, collected manner. Despite the film's two hour runtime, not once is it ever boring thanks to the creative direction of Anthony Maras, who puts his audience right at the forefront of the conflict. The film's violence, while not too graphic, is extremely intense as no one is spared from the terrorist's gunfire, not even small children or the elderly. If one can stomach enough of the bloodshed to appreciate this otherwise well-made movie, then it is certainly worth at least one viewing. However, being that this is not for the faint of heart, viewer discretion is strongly advisedI rate it 8.5/10",9,87,278,14 March 2019
Everest," Shows how this dangerous sport can easily become a life or death situation for all those involved
","Everest is a drama film about the 1996 Mount Everest disaster which resulted in the deaths of several mountain climbers. Even though I know absolutely nothing about mountain climbing, nor do I have any interest in ever doing so myself, I really liked the film for the most part. It shows how this dangerous sport can easily become a life or death situation for all those involved.Since Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay first successfully reached the summit of Mount Everest in 1953, many other mountaineers have tried, and often failed to do so as well. One such mountaineer, a New Zealand man named Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), had managed to ascend to the top of Everest a record 4 times. This movie chronicles what would have been his fifth successful ascent to the top. Upon reaching the peak of the world's tallest mountain, Rob, along with the rest of his fellow mountaineers, are caught in a deadly snowstorm, which hinders the groups' progress in descending back to the bottom. Several members of Rob's group end up separated in the freezing cold snow with no other way to reach one another. Many frantic attempts at communicating with them via radio by the crew at the base camp offer them limited reassurance that most of the mountaineers will make it out of this expedition alive.I feel that this film's true story transitioned very well onto the big screen. The cinematography of Mount Everest was excellent and really made you feel as if you were right there with the mountaineers on top of the world's tallest mountain. Jason Clarke, in a role originally intended for Christian Bale, was great as Rob Hall and Keira Knightley was very good as well playing Rob's pregnant wife Jan. Josh Brolin shines too, playing an American doctor named Beck Weathers who wanted to climb to the top of the mountain with Rob's group. Even though this film solidified my determination that I will never go mountain climbing, I still very much enjoyed it.I rate it 8/10.",8,0,1,15 October 2015
Midsommar," A bizarre series of events held together by its gorgeous visual style
","Midsommar is a horror mystery film starring Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor. Written and directed by Ari Aster (Hereditary), it is a bizarre series of events held together by its gorgeous visual style.After her sister murders her parents and herself, Dani (Florence Pugh) is in a distraught state, which puts her at odds with her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor). A short time later, Christian's friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) invites him and his group of friends to join them in Pelle's midsummer festival in Sweden. Hoping to ease Dani's mind, Christian decides to bring her with him to the festival and upon arriving at the commune, the two discover that the group of celebratory participants are all members of a centuries old Pagan cult with strange, backward traditions.While it is certainly not for all tastes, Midsommar manages to stand uniquely among today's modern horror films due to its interesting stylistic choices. The film's slow pace will be off-putting to many viewers but it is necessary in building tension as we are shown the increasingly unsettling nature of the cult. This creepy build up in atmosphere kept me invested in the story as I feel that simply having the cult shown to be weird from the very beginning would have not left as much impact. The only other cult related films that are similar to this would be The Wicker Man and Eyes Wide Shut.Visually, this film is rather beautiful to look at. I particularly loved the production design and creative cinematography. Even though each cult member wears white, they are given one unique feature about them, whether it's a facial irregularity or the colour of their hair. Yet, from a distance, they all appear to look the same. The film's stunning use of cinematography often framed the screen in the style of a painting and sometimes there were subtle uses of asymmetry to remind us that not everything is as it should be. It's rare for films of this type to employ this type of quality control, and I believe we have writer/director Ari Aster to thank for this.In terms of the cast, they all did a fine job. None of the main actors felt wasted and were each given their own special moment to shine. However, Florence Pugh left the strongest impression due to how expressive she was during the film's most intense scenes. It would be difficult to show the amount of distraught her character is going through without resorting to hammy overacting, but thankfully Pugh manages to rise above this to give a solid, memorable performance.Overall, this likely won't scare too many people as I don't believe it is intended for mainstream audiences, but those who have an affinity for art films or surrealist pieces should find the right amount of entertainment value. As previously mentioned, it is in the vein of The Wicker Man and Eyes Wide Shut so if you enjoyed those films, this should be a worthy addition alongside them.I rate it 7.5/10",8,2,4,14 November 2019
La La Land," An affectionate tribute to the Hollywood musicals of decades past
","La La Land is a musical film written and directed by Damian Chazelle (Whiplash) and starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. I'll admit musicals are a guilty pleasure of mine, but it's been a while since I last saw one that I really got into. Thankfully, La La Land has done just that, with its memorable songs and clever choreography.In the city of Los Angeles, aspiring actress Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) meets aspiring Jazz pianist Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) and the two fall in love. Throughout the course of their relationship, the couple strive harder and harder to make something of their potential careers in the fast-paced and surreal city.The film plays off as an affectionate tribute to the Hollywood musicals of decades past, complete with stylish dance choreography and bombastic set pieces. Also, despite its jovial tone and brightly-coloured presentation, there are plenty of bittersweet moments that prevent the film from becoming too sappy and overly sentimental. The songs were all great and they all segued perfectly into the plot. The chemistry between both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is fantastic. Both actors seem like they were having a blast filming their dancing and singing scenes.I rate it 8.5/10",9,9,15,22 February 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Improves on just about everything that was enjoyable about the 1991 film
","Beauty and the Beast is the live action remake of the classic 1991 Disney animated film. Based on the French fairy tale of the same name, this adaptation is so far the best live action update of a Disney film.In 18th century France, a beautiful young woman named Belle (Emma Watson) is imprisoned by a savage Beast (Dan Stevens) inside his giant castle. Unbeknownst to Belle, the Beast is actually a Prince who has had his physical form altered by a curse. The curse will only be broken once the Beast wins her love in return, otherwise he will remain a monster forever.This version improves on just about everything that was enjoyable about the 1991 film. The songs sound better, the set design looks better, and even the pacing feels better. The film moves at a breathless speed, but never so much that the story is hard to follow. Emma Watson is perfectly cast as Belle, not merely for her physical appearance, but for her range as an actress. The film even has some moments of dark humour and the occasional self-referential quip about certain situations the characters may be going through at someone else's expense, similar to Disney's previous live action adaptation of The Jungle Book.I rate it 8/10",8,0,5,23 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Still retains most of the fun and action that made the original such a hit
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the sequel to the 2014 film and the third entry into Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Based on the Marvel Comics characters, this film still retains most of the fun and action that made the original such a hit.A short time after the events of the first film, the Guardians of the Galaxy, lead by Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), are still travelling through space on their usual adventures. One day, after escaping from a barrage of enemies, the Guardians meet a mysterious man named Ego (Kurt Russell), who claims to be Peter's true father. Ego takes Peter to his homeworld, where he intends to live with and be a true father to him. However, the rest of the Guardians feel something doesn't seem right and investigate what Ego's true intentions really are.Filled to the brim with dry humour, great action, a catchy soundtrack, a funny Stan Lee cameo, and the rest of the Marvel film staples, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a worthy follow-up, although it does lack some of the freshness and surprise that was in the 2014 original. I particularly enjoyed the extended character development given to characters Drax (Dave Bautista) and Yondu (Michael Rooker). Once again, though, it is Vin Diesel as (Baby) Groot who steals the show in just about every scene he is in. As to be expected, there are some post-credits scenes to stay back for, five of them to be precise.I rate it 8/10",8,9,17,27 April 2017
The Shape of Water," After more than twenty years in the business, del Toro is still full of surprises
","The Shape of Water is a fantasy film starring Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, and Octavia Spencer. Directed and co-written by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth, Pacific Rim), it is an emotional story about friendship and a refreshing return to the fantasy genre from the veteran filmmaker.In the early 1960s in Baltimore, Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins), a mute woman, works as a janitor at a top secret government laboratory run by Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). One day, the lab receives a humanoid amphibian creature captured from a South American river. Over a period of time, Elisa forms a special bond with the creature and devises a plan to help it escape with her.Visually stunning and poignant, The Shape of Water is exactly the type of film one would expect from Guillermo del Toro and shows that even after more than twenty years in the business, he is still full of surprises. Like Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water feels like a fairy tale for adults, with its storybook-like tone and fantasy elements. The film is uniquely tailored to del Toro's style, as it likely would have been awkward and disturbing in the hands of any other filmmaker. Sally Hawkins was simply brilliant as the mute Elisa Esposito, considering she has no dialogue whatsoever and her acting is entirely visual. Michael Shannon was also great as Colonel Richard Strickland, a man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.I rate it 8/10",8,53,102,18 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," A fascinating and often funny look into the making of The Room
","The Disaster Artist is a comedy-drama film directed by and starring James Franco. Based on the non-fiction book 'The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Film Ever Made' by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell, it is a fascinating and often funny look into the making of The Room, a film widely considered to be one of the worst ever made.In San Francisco in 1998, aspiring actor Greg Sestero (Dave Franco) meets a bizarre, long-haired, heavily-accented man in his acting class named Tommy Wiseau (James Franco) and the two form a strange friendship. One day, Tommy persuades Greg to move with him to Los Angeles in hopes of pursuing their mutual dreams of stardom. Tempted by the thought of becoming famous, Greg immediately agrees and the two embark on an adventure through Hollywood. After neither of them receive any movie offers, Tommy decides to make his own movie, which will be written, directed, produced by and starring him and Greg in the lead roles.Charming and fun to watch, The Disaster Artist is an amusing but cautionary tale about following one's dreams and the longing to make it big in Hollywood, even if it does detract a bit from the book it was based on. The filmmakers did a superb job recreating some of The Room's most (in)famous scenes, from Johnny's (Tommy's) anger on the rooftop ('I did not hit her! It's not true!') to his argument with his future wife ('You are tearing me apart, Lisa!'). James Franco is mesmerising as Tommy Wiseau. His mimicry of Tommy's mysterious European accent and mannerisms are on point, but never so much that they feel like outright mockery. James' real-life younger brother Dave Franco was also great as Greg Sestero. One can't help but feel sorry for the real Greg with what he went through helping Tommy get this movie made. While not a requirement, I strongly recommend watching The Room before seeing this film, as I feel it would help put certain moments in the proper context. Also, be sure to stay after the credits for a hilarious bonus scene.I rate it 8/10",8,1,7,6 December 2017
Sausage Party," An enjoyable send up of Disney Pixar films
","Sausage Party is an adult CGI animated comedy film. I'm a big fan of Disney Pixar animated movies and this film is a fun and enjoyable parody of them. Even though the humour sometimes felt forced, the film's message of self-discovery is what I believe holds it up.At 'Shopwell's' supermarket, all the anthropomorphic groceries on sale dream of one day being picked by customers to be taken to their new homes. However, some of the groceries soon learn the terrible truth of what happens to them once they have been purchased by humans. A sausage named Frank (voiced by Seth Rogen) attempts to warn his fellow Shopwell's grocery items of their inevitable fate before it is too late.Filled to the brim with crude jokes and political incorrectness, Sausage Party is an enjoyable send up of Disney Pixar films. The animation was nice to look at and definitely on par with most of today's CGI animated features. The jokes didn't always work, but the ones that did had me laughing out loud. This film is not for the easily offended and definitely not for children, but if you enjoy the comedy of Seth Rogen and his stoner buddies, then I recommend seeing it.I rate it 7/10.",7,19,41,11 August 2016
Joker," One of the most enthralling depictions of a man's decent into madness and the effects it has on those around him
","Joker is a standalone origin story of the eponymous DC Comics villain from the Batman series. Starring Joaquin Phoenix in the title role and directed and co-written by Todd Phillips, it is a brilliant, enthralling depiction of a man's descent into madness and the effects it has on those around him.In 1981 in Gotham City, mentally ill Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) takes care of his ailing mother in their run-down apartment while working a menial job as a clown. Being isolated from society, Arthur struggles to fit in with those around him, frequently bullied and beaten up by several unruly people. Determined to make something of himself, Arthur tries laughing his way through his ever-mounting problems to become a successful comedian and leave an impression on the world, no matter how far he must go to get his point across.As shocking as it is engaging, Joker succeeds spectacularly by showcasing a realistic character study of a madman and how often individuals like this are ignored by society. Throughout the film, it seems every character Arthur Fleck encounters is either a hypocrite, a liar, disingenuous, or all of the above. Each moment of his collapsing mental state is shown with intricate care, never once seeming like it is all happening at once but instead as one bad situation after another. This draws comparisons to the characters of Travis Bickle from 'Taxi Driver' and Rupert Pupkin in 'The King of Comedy', both of which were social rejects who resorted to more sinister means of gaining attention.Joaquin Phoenix simply owns the role as Arthur Fleck/Joker, practically besting Heath Ledger in almost every way, which is saying quite a lot considering the long-lasting impact Ledger's portrayal has left on pop culture. Phoenix's dark sunken eyes and skinny frame (whom he reportedly lost 24 kgs/52 lbs in preparation) works to his advantage and adds so much tragic pathos to the character while at the same time showing him as someone we should avoid idolising. This could easily be the role of his career and he deserves every bit of praise he earns.Martin Scorsese, who was initially attached as an executive producer, has clearly left his influence all over this film, with several of his cinematic techniques worked into the final product. Director Todd Phillips, best known for directing The Hangover trilogy, handles this film surprisingly well, implementing several of Scorsese's trademarks, from the jarring bursts of graphic violence to the murky cinematography of downtown Gotham City. It almost seems like this film is being used as an allegory for any controversy that some of Scorsese's work may have been indirectly responsible for, like how 'Taxi Driver' inspired John Hinckley Jr. to shoot President Ronald Reagan to impress Jodie Foster.Overall, while I do think this film is excellent, I must take care in whom I recommend it to. This needs to be viewed with the correct mindset, understanding that the actions of Arthur Fleck should never be admired and taken at face value. Anybody who unironically believes that Arthur has done nothing wrong by the end should seek the professional help they urgently need.I rate it a perfect 10/10",10,4,10,3 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Aliens meets Starship Troopers meets Groundhog Day
","Edge of Tomorrow is a science fiction film starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. It had a very clever plot and well-paced action scenes. What intrigued me about it was that it is based on a Japanese graphic novel (or manga) called 'All You Need Is Kill'.The story is about an army officer named William Cage (Tom Cruise) who gets caught up in fighting a war against an elite alien race along side Special Forces soldier Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt). Shortly after dying the first time he is dropped into combat, he discovers that he is stuck in a time loop which repeats the same scenario over and over. Realising they can use this to their advantage, Cage and Vrataski hone their battle skills each time the loop occurs and hatch a plan to kill the aliens and win the war.This concept was very cleverly executed. It was like Aliens meets Starship Troopers meets Groundhog Day. When the movie wanted to be funny with jokes about deja vu, it was hilarious. Even Tom Cruise, whom I normally despise, was very good in this movie, not taking himself too seriously and Emily Blunt was enjoyable as well.I rate it 8/10.",8,4,7,4 June 2016
Whiplash," One of the best acted movies I've ever seen.
","Whiplash is a drama film starring Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons. It was fantastic. Along with Birdman, I'd say it's one of the best acted movies I've ever seen.Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is a young man who aspires to be one of the greatest drummers of all time. Being the only musically inclined member of his family, Andrew feels he has a lot to prove to both himself and the rest of the world. After enrolling at one of the most difficult music conservatories in the country, Andrew ends up being mentored by the harsh, abusive, yet well respected Terrance Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), who is determined to make sure that his students will stop at nothing to reach their potential. Over time, Fletcher's unorthodox teaching methods start to take their toll on both Andrew's physical and mental health but he realises that it may actually be benefitting him.The film was so well acted it almost felt like I was watching a documentary. J.K. Simmons gives a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance as Terrance Fletcher and Miles Teller was great as well. I don't usually care much for Jazz music but after seeing this movie, I have a new found respect for both the genre and its musicians. You can really see the blood, sweat and tears (literally!) that goes into some Jazz performances on stage.I rate it a solid 9/10.",9,2,4,23 December 2015
It Chapter Two," A solid follow-up to the original that continues the streak of excellent adaptations of King's work
","IT Chapter Two is the sequel to the 2017 adaptation of Stephen King's horror novel of the same name. Starring Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Isaiah Mustafa, and Bill Skarsgård, it is a solid follow-up to the original that continues the streak of excellent adaptations of King's work.Twenty-seven years after the events of Chapter One, the Loser's Club have all grown up and left the town of Derry, Maine, with the sole exception of Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), who chose to remain as the town librarian. One night, Mike realises to his horror that IT has returned and has resumed feeding on scared children. Before IT can claim more victims, Mike calls up his childhood friends one by one to reunite them and fulfill the vow they took when they were younger to destroy IT permanently.Much like its predecessor, IT Chapter Two relies on scaring the audience through building up a creepy atmosphere of uncertainty and inner torment within the main characters, rather than with typical jumpscares. In spite of that, this film was considerably more drama heavy with less horror elements, likely due to the previous film featuring children a great deal more and the protagonists now being mature adults. The grown-up Loser's Club cast in this film each do a fantastic job mirroring their child counterparts. All of them bring their own uniqueness to their characters, with Bill Hader standing out the most as the grown up Richie, who injects some much needed comic relief into some of the film's more dramatic moments. However, once again, it is Bill Skarsgård as IT, in particularly his clown form Pennywise, who is truly terrifying as a supernatural force to be reckoned with. Despite the 170 minute runtime, the film is never boring and is brilliantly paced and edited thanks to the creative direction of Andy Muschietti. This really does feels like the conclusion to what could be considered the ultimate Stephen King adaptation, complete with all of the usual tropes and even some surprising references to his other work. With that said, IT Chapter Two is certainly worth watching, provided Chapter One has been viewed first of course.I rate it 8.5/10",9,49,98,5 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," A sufficient reboot of the King Kong franchise
","Kong: Skull Island is a monster film starring Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, John C. Reilly, and Brie Larson. Packed with all the giant monster movie clichés and fun action scenes one would hope to see, it serves as a sufficient reboot of the King Kong franchise.In 1973, a group of explorers led by a band of soldiers journey to a mysterious uncharted island in the Pacific Ocean. Upon arrival, the group realise the island is swarming with giant monstrous animals and insect-like creatures who have called this place their home for millions of years. After becoming separated amidst the chaos, the groups eventually meet with the local natives who worship a skyscraper-sized ape named Kong who protects them from the giant monsters. While the film doesn't offer much in terms of actual plot, the action and fight scenes more than make up for it. The special effects were great and the CGI for Kong and the other giant monsters were all very convincing. The characters were all essentially stock action roles but thanks to the believable performances from the lead actors, they're still fun to watch. I also enjoyed the fact that Kong has more screen time and a greater relevance on the film's story, unlike with how Godzilla was barely in the 2014 film. I look forward to seeing these two monsters duke it out in a future film.I rate it 7/10",7,48,94,9 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A fitting finale
","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the third and final film of the prequels to The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It was a fitting finale that I very much enjoyed. This film makes everything in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth stories come full circle.Picking up right where The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug left off, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the Dwarfs are forced into combat to protect the treasure of Lonely Mountain from falling into the wrong hands. Many of the different races of Middle Earth (Men, Elves and Orcs) are now marching toward the mountain to either do battle or resolve the whole thing peacefully.This is easily the most action packed of the three Hobbit films. The final battle scenes are very well shot, although they still pale in comparison to anything in the original Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Martin Freeman is once again great as the young Bilbo Baggins who really shows his courage and determination this time around. Also, Middle Earth looks amazing as usual (it makes me really want to visit New Zealand one day!).I rate it 8.5/10, the same scores as its two predecessors.",9,0,2,25 December 2015
Finding Dory," A more mellow and slow-paced follow-up, which certainly isn't a bad thing
","Finding Dory is the long awaited sequel to the Disney Pixar classic Finding Nemo. While Pixar aren't well known for the quality of their sequels and prequels (with the exception of the Toy Story films), this one was actually very good. It's a more mellow and slow-paced follow-up, which certainly isn't a bad thing.Six months after the events of Finding Nemo, Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) suddenly remembers something important about her childhood and sets off to her original home, located in Morro Bay, California. Due to Dory's frequent short-term memory loss, she has great difficulty trying to piece together the fractured remnants of her memories and often forgets things at the most important of times. Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), with his son Nemo, follow after Dory to help her along with her journey to discover what it is she is really looking for.Beautiful to look at and quite touching at times, Finding Dory is a worthy successor to the excellent original film. Being more slow-paced than its predecessor, this allowed for more poignant and atmospheric moments to really take effect. The voice acting was great as well, particularly from Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. I also enjoyed many of the new characters introduced, my personal favourite was Hank, a cynical Octopus voiced by Ed O'Neill. If you enjoyed the original, then I recommend seeing this one.I rate it 8/10. Special mention also goes to the cute animated short at the beginning titled 'Piper', which is about a baby Sandpiper learning how to feed itself.",8,5,18,15 June 2016
Arrival," A must-see for anyone who enjoys cleverly written sci-fi
","Arrival is a science fiction film starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. Easily one of the most thought-provoking films I have seen since Interstellar, it is a must-see for anyone who enjoys cleverly written sci-fi. However, if you are expecting non-stop action and explosions, you will be disappointed.In random locations around the world, twelve mysterious alien spacecrafts touch down with unknown intentions. A special team is assembled by the US military, led by Colonel Weber (Forrest Whitaker), to attempt to communicate with the aliens. The team enlists the help of expert linguist Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to help translate the alien language to figure out if they are here for peaceful reasons or to declare war on humanity.Featuring clever and intriguing themes about the nature of humanity and our place in the universe, Arrival is a thinking person's sci-fi film that delivers everything you'd expect and more. Director Denis Villeneuve's creative use of cinematography and long shots inside the alien spacecraft is very reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I think he's a great choice to direct the upcoming Blade Runner 2049. Amy Adams gives an excellent performance in the role of Dr. Louise Banks. There was never a moment in the film where her character felt unbelievable or forced. I highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys science fiction with something intelligent to say.I rate it 8.5/10",9,5,10,10 November 2016
Parasite," A quirky, yet surprisingly well-made romp that could only come from somewhere like Korea
","Parasite is a South Korean black comedy directed by Bong Joon-ho (Snowpiercer, OKJA). Based on a screenplay by Han Jin-won and Bong Joon-ho, it is a quirky, yet surprisingly well-made romp that could only come from somewhere like Korea.In Seoul, the unemployed Kim family, led by Ki-taek, his wife Choong-sook, son Ki-woo, and daughter Ki-jeong try to get by in their cramped basement apartment. One day, Ki-woo's friend suggests to him that he take over as a tutor for the daughter of the rich Park family while he travels abroad. Over time, the rest of the Kim family start taking jobs offered to them by the Parks at their large mansion while masquerading under fake names so as not to give away that the four of them are related and eventually start to reap the benefits of the Park's swanky lifestyle.With its unique Korean style, Parasite has just the right balance between dark comedy and family drama that it never bores its audience. It's just so much fun seeing how each member of the Kim family were adjusting to their new lavish ways in a house that doesn't even belong to them. This feels like a commentary on societal class in Korea, in how each citizen likely has their own perspective on how to live in the moment. Even better is the ending, which I will not spoil, but what I will say is that it concludes the story in the best way possible. If you watch one Korean movie this year, make it this one.",9,1,5,3 October 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A clever satire on the behind-the-scenes worlds of both the film and Broadway industries.
","Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a black comedy starring Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Stone and Edward Norton. It is one of the best acted films I've ever seen. The script was well written too. It is a clever satire on the behind-the- scenes worlds of both the film and Broadway industries.Riggin Thomson (Michael Keaton) is a washed up film actor who once played an iconic superhero during the early 90s. Since leaving the role that made him famous, Riggin is now dealing with family problems, including his former drug addict daughter Sam (Emma Stone) and his strained relationship with his girlfriend Laura. He is also haunted by the voice of his character of Birdman and even hallucinates that he still has all of Birdman's superpowers. Determined to get his career and life back on track, Riggin decides to write, direct and star in his own Broadway play, overseen by his best friend and lawyer Jake (Zach Galifianakis) and starring alongside the arrogant method actor Mike (Edward Norton).Michael Keaton was outstanding in this movie. It really feels like he is finally getting the recognition he deserves as an actor. Everyone else was great as well, including Edward Norton, Zach Galifianakis and Emma Stone. The cinematography is worth noting as well. It felt like the audience was right there with the character of Riggin every step of the way through all of his trials and tribulations.I rate the film itself 9/10, but the acting from the cast gets a perfect 10/10.",9,1,6,23 December 2015
The Water Diviner," Russ definitely shows he has what it takes as a director
","The Water Diviner is a historical drama about the Gallipoli campaign directed by and starring Russell Crowe. I really enjoyed it. It was very respectful to both the Turkish and ANZAC soldiers who fought in World War I.Russell Crowe plays Josh Connor, an Australian father of three boys who were sent off to fight at Gallipoli on the 25th of April 1915. A few months afterwards, the three brothers were reported as missing in action. One year after the war had ended, Josh travels to Turkey to locate the bodies of his sons and bring them back home to Australia for a proper burial to fulfil a promise he made to their mother.The film was very well shot, the sweeping cinematography really showcased the vast, sprawling Australian desert and the cramped, dank conditions of the trenches at the Gallipoli battlefield. Russell Crowe's character was very likable too, a larrikin Aussie with a deep heart who just wants closure on what happened to his sons. As far as directorial debuts go, Russ definitely shows he has what it takes.I rate it 8/10.",8,1,3,20 December 2015
Wonder Woman," Exactly the type of movie that the DC Universe has needed for some time
","Wonder Woman is a superhero film starring Gal Gadot in the title role and the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe. Directed by Patty Jenkins (2003's Monster), the film not only redeems the DC Universe of some of its previous missteps, but also breathes some new life into the superhero franchise as a whole.In 1918, the Amazonian princess Diana (Gal Gadot) trains with her fellow warrior sisters on the isolated island nation of Themyscira. One day, an American pilot named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands near the island. After being rescued by Diana, Steve tells her and the other Amazonians of the outside world and of a 'war to end all wars' currently being waged by the human race. Refusing to allow the death and carnage to continue, Diana decides to leave with Steve and fight alongside him to hopefully put a stop to the evil people responsible for this war.Featuring a well paced plot and some creatively choreographed action scenes, Wonder Woman is exactly the type of movie that the DC Universe has needed for some time, considering some of the poor creative decisions that were made in its three predecessors. There was also a good balance of humour scattered throughout the story, very much in the vein of some Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, but never so much that it feels forced and tacked on at the last minute. Gal Gadot's performance in the eponymous role is great, her acting range has improved significantly since Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. My only real complaint is that the film does follow a typical 'superhero origin story' format and does little to detract from that. However, considering how interesting the main character is, this does not draw away too much enjoyment from the overall film.I rate it 8.5/10",9,52,114,1 June 2017
Marriage Story," An often poignant story about a declining marriage told with a rare feeling of sincerity
","Marriage Story is a comedy-drama written and directed by Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale, Greenberg). Starring Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, it is an often poignant story about a declining marriage told with a rare feeling of sincerity.In New York City, Charlie Barber (Adam Driver) lives with his former actress wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and eight-year-old son Henry (Azhy Robertson) where he works as a theatre director for a successful stage company. Due to Charlie's commitment to his hard work, he and Nicole's once happy marriage begins to fall apart, and Nicole decides to move to Los Angeles where she has been offered the lead role in a TV pilot, taking Henry with her. Due to the lengthy travelling distance from east coast to west, Charlie struggles to find time to see Henry in amidst working on his current stage play and risks losing all custody of him in the impending divorce as a result.With its powerful acting and careful direction, Marriage Story successfully sets itself apart from most other family dramas to become one of the best of its genre in years. It is not often to see a film that can balance both sides of the conflict with such care that it makes you truly think about the ramifications it has on not just the two fighting parties in question, but also the other family members as well. What is also taken into consideration is how extended family are affected too, with Nicole's mother and sister clearly having a close relationship with Charlie throughout the film, realising that their lives will be forever changed by this divorce as well. Of course, in the end, it is obvious that the most affected by all of this will be the child, being exposed to such heavy responsibilities at a young age, like deciding which parent they prefer to live with.Writer/director Noah Baumbach handles this subject matter with just the right amount of realism to avoid spiralling into cliched territory. This may be due to the fact that Baumbach is a divorcee himself with a young son, and likely wished to depict this heavy topic as genuine as possible so as to reflect his own personal experiences. As well as this, Baumbach appears to have taken influence from films such as 'Kramer vs. Kramer' and even his own film, 2005's 'The Squid and the Whale', all of which dealt with the subject of divorce in both a light-hearted and serious manner. If I did have one problem, it is that the ending does showcase some brief unnecessary sentimentality, which does detract from the previously mentioned realism, but considering what we have seen each character go through, it only feels like a minor issue.Both of the film's lead stars gave excellent performances. Seeing Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson verbally bounce off one another with such fiery intensity is truly a fascinating sight. I often found myself forgetting the two aren't actually a couple in real life as their chemistry is simply perfect. There is so much to appreciate in each time the two were interacting, thanks in part to Baumbach's solid script, which gave them several memorable scenes depicting the degradation of their marriage.In conclusion, I believe this film will certainly strike a chord with anyone who has been through a divorce or has witnessed one unfold before their eyes. Personally, I haven't experienced either, but that did not affect my overall opinion of the film and that likely shouldn't for anyone else. My advice is to take in what the film has to say on this serious topic and appreciate what its writer/director and lead actors have presented for our viewing pleasure.I rate it 8.5/10",9,5,8,12 December 2019
Straight Outta Compton," Opens your eyes to the influence and legacy the group has left on the music industry, both good and bad.
","Straight Outta Compton is the biopic about the controversial hip-hop group N.W.A and each of its five members. As far as biopics go, this one was very informative for the most part. It really opens your eyes to the influence and legacy the group has left on the music industry, both good and bad.In 1986 Compton, California, five friends Dr Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, MC Ren and DJ Yella form the hip-hop group N.W.A. Their first hit single, Eazy-E's 'Boyz-n-the-Hood' becomes a smash hit and gets the attention of music manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), who is hired to become the group's manager. A short time after this, the group is picked up by label Priority Records, who help them to produce the group's debut album 'Straight Outta Compton', which becomes a huge success both commercially and critically. With their newfound nationwide fame, the group begins to feel the pressures of the controversy they have stirred in their song lyrics, in particular, the infamous 'F--k Tha Police'. Many race riots ensue and the group is blamed for inciting violence against the police and other authority figures.Whether you're a fan of hip-hop or not, the film still makes for a fascinating look into music history. It transports us back to a time when hip-hop seemed like the only real voice that young people growing up in Compton, California really had. Throughout the film, there is occasional inter-splicing of real news footage showing what was going on in Los Angeles at the time. This adds a feeling of realism to the film's narrative and makes you feel like you're living though what's going on. The film's lead actors, including O'Shea Jackson Jr, the real Ice Cube's son, all did a fantastic job in their roles. Paul Giamatti was great as well, playing the group's manager Jerry Heller. My biggest problem with the film, however, is that it only really shows us the lives of Dr Dre, Ice Cube and Eazy-E, whereas we're barely told anything about N.W.A's remaining two members MC Ren and DJ Yella. I am aware that they had nowhere near as successful careers after the group disbanded, but it still would have been nice to have known more about them at the same time.I rate it 8/10.",8,3,28,15 October 2015
Black Panther," A benchmark in the MCU and is easily one of its best standalone films
","Black Panther is the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the sixth film in Phase 3 of the series. Directed by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed), it sets the bar to an all time high for Marvel films and provides a brilliant lead-in to Avengers: Infinity War.Shortly after the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) returns to his country of Wakanda in Africa to be crowned as its new King. However, upon arriving home, T'Challa finds his position as King challenged by a old enemy whose intentions are far more sinister than merely seizing leadership over Wakanda and its citizens.Featuring some of the best written supporting characters and action scenes in a Marvel film, Black Panther is a benchmark in the series and is easily one of its best standalone films. The film's world building element showcases the vibrant and futuristic look of Wakanda, a fictional African country proudly entrenched its heritage and tradition. We also gain a somewhat James Bond/Jason Bourne vibe from the film at times, with its spy thriller elements and exciting car chases. Director Ryan Coogler does a suburb job fleshing out the main villain Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), whose motives go beyond merely world domination and lust for power. Chadwick Boseman is fantastic as the title character, the serious but kindhearted King who only wants what is best for his people, as was briefly touched on in Captain America: Civil War. Like with every other film in the series, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.I rate it 8.5/10",9,10,43,15 February 2018
Mother!," One of the strangest, most bizarre, confronting, and surreal experiences I have ever had to sit through
","Mother! is a psychological horror film starring Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem. Written and directed by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan), it is one of the strangest, most bizarre, confronting, and surreal experiences I have ever had to sit through while watching a movie.In a country home, a well-known poet with writer's block (Javier Bardem) and his wife (Jennifer Lawrence) live their lives in peace and quiet. One day, a mysterious couple (Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer) turn up at their door to take refuge in the home and a series of strange events begin to occur.While undoubtedly thought-provoking, Mother! is equally as sensationalistic and divisive in the way it handles its themes and symbolism. This is definitely not a film for mainstream audiences and seems to be intended for those who enjoy the surreal work of filmmakers David Lynch and Lars von Trier. Jennifer Lawrence does a fine job conveying her confusion as to what is happening around her, almost as though she is channeling the film's audience itself. As a whole, this is a difficult film to review correctly as it contains so many complicated metaphors and references that few would actually understand. It may require more than one viewing to properly take in everything it is trying to say.I have no rating for it.",Null,0,0,21 December 2017
Creed II," A solid follow-up to its predecessor and a great boxing film in general
","Creed II (a.k.a. Rocky VIII) is the sequel to 2015's Creed and the eighth installment in the Rocky film franchise. Starring Michael B Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, and Dolph Lundgren, it is a solid follow-up to its predecessor and a great boxing film in general.Three years after the events of the previous film, Adonis Creed (Michael B Jordan) has won several boxing matches to become the World Heavyweight Champion. However, Adonis' celebration is short lived as Viktor Drago (Florian 'Big Nasty' Munteanu), the son of Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), steps forward to challenge him. Despite the refusal of support from his trainer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), Adonis decides to accept the challenge as a means to get revenge against Viktor's father Ivan for killing his father 33 years prior.Still as feel-good as the Rocky films as can get, Creed II matches its predecessor in just about every way possible. Michael B Jordan is once again fantastic in the title role and he does a superb job holding the viewer's attention throughout the story. His scenes with Tessa Thompson were so touching and added a necessary degree of sweetness to the film that was often needed. Sylvester Stallone is also great as the elderly Rocky Balboa, and despite being limited to a supporting role, he still manages to have a memorable role in the story, especially when seeing him go eye-to-eye with his old nemesis Ivan Drago. In terms of plot, the film is an amalgamation of Rocky III and Rocky IV and while some outcomes were fairly predictable, there are still the occasional surprises to keep the audience on their toes. The only major complaint is that Viktor Drago's character wasn't developed as well as he should have been. There was only really one important scene of dialogue with him and his father but for the most part it just seemed like the only reason he was in the film was to be used as vessel for his father to channel his grudge against Rocky in the boxing ring. Overall, this is a solid sequel and a worthy eighth film featuring the character of Rocky Balboa and it would certainly be interesting to see where the franchise goes from here.I rate it 8.5/10",9,1,2,29 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A decent superhero movie.
","Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is the second film in the DC Extended Universe and the sequel to 2013's Man of Steel. In spite of the overwhelming negative feedback I noticed it has been receiving, I found it to be a decent superhero movie for the most part. It seems that this film was made for fans of the first one, rather than for the casual film- goer.Eighteen months after the events of Man of Steel, the world is divided over whether or not Superman (Henry Cavill) is the saviour they really need. As a result, Batman (Ben Affleck), the dark vigilante of Gotham City, decides to take matters into his own hands and travels to Metropolis to fight Superman one-on-one in an attempt to keep him in check.Despite the great explosive action scenes and the very idea of finally seeing these two famous superheros duking it out with one another, the film is unfortunately marred by pacing issues and bad editing, particularly during the first act. The film's runtime of nearly 2 and a half hours also poses a problem, as it bogs the film down with a lot of unnecessary exposition. Even so, I still really enjoyed the cast, in particular, Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman, whom I believe to be one of the best on-screen depictions of the character. Gal Gadot was also surprisingly good as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince, even though her screen time was quite short. However, I have mixed feelings about Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He just seemed to portray him as a spoiled rich kid rather than the psychotic megalomaniac I was hoping to see. Overall, if you liked Man of Steel, then I recommend watching it.I rate it 7/10.",7,2,7,24 March 2016
The Greatest Showman," A dazzling and fun showcase of Jackman's talents as an actor and an interesting look into the life of its main subject
","The Greatest Showman is a musical drama film loosely based on the life of circus showman P. T. Barnum. Starring Hugh Jackman in the lead role, it is a dazzling and fun showcase of Jackman's talents as an actor and an interesting look into the life of its main subject.In New York City, P. T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) lives with his wife Charity (Michelle Williams) and two daughters in a basic house working a menial office job. Despite their relatively simple life, Barnum has ambitions for greater things and after losing his job, he takes out a huge loan from the bank to start his own wax museum of oddities and freaks. After slow business, Barnum's daughters suggest showcasing 'living' exhibits and so decides to recruit real life performers for his museum, eventually leading to a high number of attendance from curious spectators.There's no denying The Greatest Showman has irresistible dance numbers, memorable songs, and an interesting plot, but unfortunately the story does feel predictable at times and some of Barnum's circus performers feel annoyingly underdeveloped. It's a shame the film does not focus enough on personalities of the other performers, outside of the fact that they're human beings rather than 'freaks of nature'. Despite this, the acting from its cast is solid, particularly Hugh Jackman in the title role, who is a delight to watch from his energetic presence to his dramatic sincerity. As far as modern musicals go, this is one of the best.I rate it 7.5/10",8,4,8,19 April 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Successfully blends quirky humour and heavy hitting drama without ever losing sight of its own unique identity
","Jojo Rabbit is a comedy drama war film written and directed by Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows). Based on the novel 'Caging Skies' by Christine Leunens, it successfully blends quirky humour and heavy hitting drama without ever losing sight of its own unique identity.During the last years of World War II, the timid ten-year-old Johannes Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) joins the Hitler Youth as he longs to defend his Nazi German homeland from the allied powers. Supporting him along the way is his imaginary friend - an eccentric childlike version of Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi). After refusing to kill a rabbit during a training exercise, Johannes is given the derogatory nickname 'Jojo Rabbit' by the other youth members. One day, Jojo discovers to his shock that his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) has been hiding a young Jewish girl named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in the wall of their house. Knowing full well that they will all be executed if the Nazis find out, Jojo decides to strike a deal with Elsa in that he will protect her in exchange for her sharing 'Jew secrets' with him.As is the case with all of Taika Waititi's films, Jojo Rabbit is filled with his signature tongue-in-cheek comedy that even the most casual of audiences can enjoy. Most of the laughs come from scenes where Jojo's interacts with the imaginary Hitler, which is what someone of his age would perceive Hitler to be like. However, whenever the film needs to touch on serious topics, such as the Jewish plight under Nazi rule, the film never trivialises such a thing and handles it in a respectful manner. This is a difficult film to get the tone just right for, but thanks to the careful efforts of Waititi, he manages to strike that perfect balance between funny and sombre.In terms of production values, this may be Waititi's best work to date. His use of muted background colours is particularly noteworthy, as it helps make his lead cast members stand out in several scenes, especially during parts where they need to be seen separately from other Nazi characters. The use of cinematography is great as well, as we are shown the widespread Nazi presence in Jojo's small village, whether it's the tanks all lined up against buildings or the 'unpatriotic deserters' being hanged in the streets. This again reminds us that even though the film is technically a comedy, it still uses Nazi Germany as a backdrop, who were responsible for many horrific acts.All of the cast members did a superb job in their roles. Young newcomer Roman Griffin Davis carries the film in such a natural fashion that it is hard to believe that this is his very first role in a motion picture. He and Thomasin McKenzie, the latter of whom rose to prominence with her memorable performance in the 2018 film 'Leave No Trace', had such wonderful on-screen chemistry and I loved watching the two of them interact with one another in spite of their character's polar opposites. Scarlett Johansson is also worth noting as Jojo's mother Rosie. Even though her screen time is limited, she leaves an impression thanks to her ability to chew the scenery as much as possible.In conclusion, while the film's use of Nazi Germany as a backdrop for a comedy may seem off-putting to some mainstream viewers, any fan of Taika Waititi's work should enjoy it immensely. It truly shows how far he has come since his humble beginnings back in New Zealand and certainly has me on board for any future projects he has lined up for us.I rate it 8.5/10",9,1,3,26 December 2019
Midway," One of the better entries in Emmerich's filmography, but only barely
","Midway is a war drama film directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Patriot, 2012) based on the decisive Battle of Midway during World War II. Starring Ed Skrein, Patrick Wilson, Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart, and Woody Harrelson, it is one of the better entries in Emmerich's filmography, but only barely.In 1941, America chooses to remain neutral to the ongoing conflict raging across the globe. On December 7th of that same year, the American naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii is attacked by the Japanese, killing several people and forcing the US to enter the war. In the aftermath of this preemptive strike, the US stages the battle of Midway six months later, a subsequent retaliation against the Japanese at the US territory of the Midway Islands in the Pacific Ocean.There's no denying the actual effort being put into making it look as modern and unbiased as possible, but this retelling of the battle of Midway still has some glaring issues. For a start, the film treads cliched territory with corny dialogue and flat characterisation of its real life subjects. Lines such as 'This is for Pearl Harbor!' and 'We have awoken a sleeping giant', (the latter of which was taken from the 1970 film 'Tora! Tora! Tora!') feel like the typical over-the-top Hollywood sentiment one would expect from a war film like this. In addition, most of the characters were underdeveloped, being pushed aside to make way for an action scene. All of this is a shame because I believe all of these problems could have been avoided if only there were a better screenwriter at the helm.Roland Emmerich, while I don't think he is a particularly good director, does actually handle this film surprisingly better than expected. According to some research, making a film about the Battle of Midway had been Emmerich's passion project for a considerable amount of time and it definitely shows at certain points. His choices in cinematography during the air battles are quite interesting, often featuring the pilots charging their way into enemy fire like the way an army of soldiers on the battlefield would advance into the crossfire on land. This style of creativity was previously shown in Emmerich's 2000 film 'The Patriot', which was not a perfect film by any means, but came off as entertaining enough to prove that he could handle a film based on war with the right amount of precision and care to not be considered entirely terrible. In addition to this, I enjoyed the way he chose to show the differing viewpoints of the American and Japanese strategists as each side plans on how to deal with any potential attack. We see how the Americans tended to go for an all-out assault on their enemies while the Japanese were more about biding their time, patiently waiting out for the appropriate moment to strike.As mentioned earlier, most of the film's characters felt underutilised and underdeveloped. If you're going to make a film about a real historical event that went the way it did due to the figures involved, you'd better make sure you do their characterisation justice. There were some characters that I completely forgot about as they were only in one scene and then we never see them again until the ending coda. If it weren't for the fact that some of them were played by well-known actors like Dennis Quaid and Aaron Eckhart, I would not have realised their importance in the story. With that said, Ed Skrein's depiction of Lieutenant Richard 'Dick' Best was the only person I felt had some dimension to him. Even though the British born Skrein's attempts at an American accent came across as cartoonish at times, in particular his liberal use of 'Goddamn it!', he at least had some likeability and admirable traits that kept me invested in what he may end up doing next. There were also some nice scenes with him and his wife, played by Mandy Moore, that did remind the audience of what he is fighting for, apart from his country.In conclusion, while I do appreciate the effort Emmerich has gone to making something he has wanted for a long time, I believe he needs a better screenwriter to collaborate with. All of the potential is there in terms of his direction but the poor dialogue and character development is his biggest downfall. In spite of all this, I would much rather watch this film again than Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor.I rate it 6/10",6,1,1,12 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Does everything right that the Prequel Trilogy did wrong
","Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens is the long-awaited seventh installment in the Star Wars film series and the beginning of the brand new Sequel Trilogy. Without giving away too much, I'll say that it is the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. It does everything right that the Prequel Trilogy did wrong.Normally, I would write a synopsis here. This time I refuse to do so. There are so many secrets and twists in this film that revealing the smallest plot point could potentially spoil the entire movie. All I will say is that it takes place 30 years after the Original Trilogy. I will leave it at that.The whole film felt like a breath of fresh air to anyone wanting to see a new Star Wars movie. Almost everything in this film worked really well. The characters, new and old, lent themselves to so many memorable moments and even some great comic relief. Unlike the Prequels, which focused too much on politics, this film focuses more on the action and story. J. J. Abrams has proved that the Star Wars series is in the right hands at Disney, he was the perfect choice as the film's director. I already can't wait for Episode 8.I rate it a very high 9.5/10, the same rating as Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.",10,24,64,17 December 2015
Deadpool," The role that Ryan Reynolds was born to play
","Deadpool is a superhero comedy film based on the Marvel comic of the same name. As an adaptation of a crude, violent and hilarious comic book, it is very successful.

One day, Wade is diagnosed with cancer in most of his important internal organs. In an attempt to cure the cancer, Wade undergoes a top secret experiment which leaves him with accelerated healing powers and a sick, twisted sense of humour. As a result, he becomes Deadpool, the 'Merc With A Mouth'.Filled with all the meta-humour and action one would expect to see, Deadpool is one of the best comic book adaptations to date. You know a movie is off to a good start when even the opening credits have you laughing. There's no denying that this is the role that Ryan Reynolds was born to play.

","Kingsman: The Secret Service is an action spy comedy film based on the comic of the same name and directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass, X-Men: First Class). I thought it was great fun. It was action packed and really funny in all the right places.Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton) is a teenage delinquent, who lives with his mum and her abusive boyfriend in a small flat in London. One night, Eggsy steals the car of someone he doesn't like, crashes it into a police car and is sent to jail. A short time later he is bailed out by man named Harry Hart (Colin Firth), a veteran secret agent who informs Eggsy that his father was one of their top agents who died saving Harry's life 18 years ago. Harry takes Eggsy under his wing and leads him into the world of espionage to stop a dangerous super-villain Mr. Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) from taking over the world.There are plenty of allusions and references to other action spy films like the James Bond and Jason Bourne series and this movie satirises many of their most memorable moments really well. The film's action scenes were also very well choreographed and this is thanks to Matthew Vaughn's fast paced directing style. Colin Firth was great as the English gentleman style secret agent Harry Hart and newcomer Taron Egerton was also enjoyable as the protagonist Eggsy. There was rarely a dull moment.I rate it 8.5/10 and I recommend it to anyone who liked the first Kick Ass movie and Hot Fuzz.",9,2,7,23 December 2015
Green Book," A delightful road movie with terrific performances from both of its actors
","Green Book is a comedy-drama film directed and co-written by Peter Farrelly (Dumb & Dumber, There's Something About Mary). Starring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, it is a delightful road movie with terrific performances from both of its actors.In 1962, New York bouncer Frank 'Tony Lip' Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is looking for extra money after the nightclub he works at closes for renovations. Thanks to one of his friends, Tony lands a job as a chauffeur for 'Doc' Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a talented African-American pianist embarking on a concert tour of the American Deep South. Due to the strong animosity against African-Americans in the Deep South, Tony is required to take on extra work along the way as he is also required to use his skills as a bouncer to protect Doc and ensure he has a safe journey with his band.Heartfelt and funny, Green Book takes what could have been another generic road trip movie and turns it into one of the most interesting depictions of an otherwise unlikely friendship. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have superb chemistry with each other and the film's witty screenplay frequently had me looking forward to every moment of dialogue between both of them, especially during the driving scenes. The film also does a fantastic job of establishing the prejudiced atmosphere of the American Deep South in the 1960s without making its citizens seem too much like caricatures of typical white supremacists. Director Peter Farrelly near-flawlessly balances the film's comedy and drama, which is surprising as he is primarily known for his work only in the former genre. He has certainly shown he is more than capable of handling films like this and I am hopeful he can keep this up in any future projects he may end up involved in.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,1,1,24 January 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," More grounded than its predecessor
","John Wick: Chapter 2 is the sequel to the 2014 action thriller John Wick. Once again starring Keanu Reeves in the title role, this follow-up feels more grounded than its predecessor and thankfully tells a much different story.Four days after the events of the original, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) successfully retrieves his stolen car from the Russian gangsters and returns home. After arriving home, John is greeted by Santino D'Antonio, an Italian crime lord who forcefully assigns John with fulfilling one last 'impossible task' as part of his blood contract to the crime underworld. Upon setting out to complete the task, John soon learns that a $7 million bounty has been placed on his life and he must now try to survive every hit-man and hitwoman in his vicinity coming after him.While the most obvious route would be to completely rehash the original, John Wick: Chapter 2 follows an entirely different plot, choosing to expand upon the title character's backstory and his motivations. In the first film, several outcomes felt obvious and predictable but in this sequel it often felt like things could have gone either way. The action scenes are more frequent and even feel better choreographed this time around. There were also more fist fights in this film, alluding a great deal more to the kung fu films that it was influenced by. The creative use of colour and lighting returns and the filmmakers do a good job using them to enhance the mood and tone of a scene. Keanu Reeves continues his nuanced performance first seen in the original and it definitely works to his advantage during some of the film's more dramatic and self-reflective moments.I rate it 8/10",8,0,1,2 August 2017
Annihilation," A strange, thought-provoking, and often surreal story about a mysterious journey into the unknown
","Annihilation is a science fiction film starring Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac. Directed by Alex Garland (Ex Machina) and based on the novel of the same name, it is a strange, thought-provoking, and often surreal story about a mysterious journey into the unknown.After a strange meteorite impacts near a lighthouse, it engulfs the surrounding area in a bizarre glowing energy field, which expands in size over time. The US government dubs the phenomenon 'The Shimmer' and sends in a group of soldiers, led by Kane (Oscar Isaac) to investigate this anomaly. One year after the soldiers mysteriously vanish, the government send in Kane's biologist wife Lena (Natalie Portman), along with a group of scientists to discover what happened to the missing expedition.Told in a non-linear narrative, Annihilation dares to challenge its audience's perception of storytelling, with its dark themes and intriguing characters. This is a proper science fiction movie with actual scientific dialogue and very few action scenes, much in the vein of 2016's Arrival so this is definitely not for the casual filmgoer. Director Alex Garland showcases stunning visual effects juxtaposed with the underlying social commentary of human nature and humanity's place in the universe. Natalie Portman shines in the lead role, further proving her range as an actress, and her performance leaves a lasting impression on the viewer, as does the film itself.

Nelson), Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Huck Milner), and Jack-Jack, continue to protect their city from danger while also trying to live out their lives as normal citizens. One day, Helen is recruited by an organisation called DEVTECH, who are devoted to restoring the reputation of superheroes and regaining their popularity with the public. With his wife now away working for DEVTECH, Bob is tasked with looking after the kids and tending to their needs, which proves to be much easier said than done.The film is more action-packed than its predecessor and thanks to improved animation techniques, is far more exciting at times. All of the charm and familial love of the original film still remains in this sequel and once again there was a good balance of comedy and drama. Most of the original voice cast returns, including Craig T. Nelson as Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter as Elastigirl, and of course Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone. In the previous film, it was the character of Edna who stole show in every scene, this time, it is the adorable baby Jack-Jack who gets the most laughs every time he is on screen. The only major issue is that the villain was highly predictable with generic motives and as a result was much less clever than Syndrome was in the original. Overall, this sequel was worth the 14 year wait and hopefully there will be a third installment in the not-too-distant future.I rate it 8/10",8,19,51,14 June 2018
Spectre," A solid entry into the James Bond franchise
","SPECTRE is the latest installment in the James Bond franchise and the fourth film in the series to star Daniel Craig in the lead role. While I didn't find it quite as enjoyable as 2012's Skyfall, the film is still a solid entry into the series. It contains all of the hallmarks and fun moments that a James Bond film should have.While on a mission in Mexico, James Bond (Daniel Craig) steals the ring from an assassin which has a mysterious symbol of an octopus. Believing the symbol to be some sort of cryptic message, Bond digs deeper into the origins of what it could mean. In doing so, Bond discovers that the symbol is the logo for a dangerous criminal organisation called SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion) led by the sinister Franz Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz). Upon discovering this, Bond realises that the organisation has ties to his past and he now must figure out how to stop them from carrying out their deadly terrorist attacks around the world.Filled with all the explosive action and dry one-liners you'd expect to see from a James Bond movie, SPECTRE is a fun ride from start to finish. I was very pleased with how it tied the previous three films together with a clever sense of overarching continuity. Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Skyfall) showcases some very creative cinematography and suspenseful scenes of stealth throughout the film. Daniel Craig once again proves he's the right man for the lead role and I believe he still has it in him to make at least one more Bond movie. Christoph Waltz was great as well and I think he's a great choice as a Bond villain.I rate it 8/10.",8,4,10,12 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," One of the best action movies of the decade
","Mad Max: Fury Road is the fourth installment of the Mad Max franchise and the first film in the series in 30 years. To call it the best action movie of the year would be an understatement. This is easily one of the best action movies of the decade. It successfully breathes new life into this classic action film series, and brings it to a whole new generation.In the year 2060, Australia and the rest of the world is in ruins after a huge apocalyptic event occurs. As a result, humanity is broken and food, water and fuel is scarce, so much so that violence and murder is common from those seeking out ways to survive. Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy, replacing Mel Gibson) is still adrift in the desert many years after the events of the third film when he meets Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a tough, no- nonsense woman of action who is searching for her homeland. Furiosa has captive with her the five wives of King Immortan Joe, a vicious military leader who rules over the desert kingdom known as the Wasteland. Reluctantly, Max and Furiosa, along with one of Joe's former soldiers Nux (Nicholas Hoult) ally together to fight back against Joe to free his wives from his clutches and try to restore order to the Wasteland and its people.This is easily one of the most bad-ass movies I have ever seen. The car chases are extremely well filmed and choreographed, much better than any of the ones in its predecessors. I also liked how it kept its gritty atmosphere, which I felt was very lacking in the third film. Tom Hardy is a decent replacement for Mel Gibson playing Max, as I feel that Mel would be too old for some of the stunts required in this film, although his accent did keep drifting between Australian and British throughout the movie. But the real surprise was Charlize Theron as Furiosa. She channels some of the more bad-ass female film characters like Ellen Ripley from the Alien franchise into her performance. There's never a dull moment.I rate it a solid 9/10.",9,3,11,15 October 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Despite Gibson's chequered past, he is still capable of creating gripping and emotional movies
","Hacksaw Ridge is a war drama film starring Andrew Garfield and directed by Mel Gibson. To quote South Park; 'Say what you want about Mel Gibson, but the son-of-a-b***h knows story structure!', and that is made very clear in his most recent directorial effort. This film proves that despite Gibson's chequered past, he is still capable of creating gripping and emotional movies.The film depicts the true story of Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield), a combat medic who because of his religious moral code, refused to use a weapon during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Despite initially being labelled as a coward by his fellow soldiers, Doss ends up saving several lives in the midst of the bloodshed.As to be expected, director Mel Gibson does not hold back in his depiction of the carnage of war; bodies are shredded by bullets, heads are blown off, and soldiers are set on fire. However, due to the infrequency of the violence throughout the film (most of the violence takes place during the third act), it never feels glorified. Andrew Garfield gives possibly the performance of his career as Desmond T. Doss. From his scrawny appearance at the beginning to his courageous combat medic persona on the battlefield, Garfield always feels like he's giving it his all.I rate it a solid 9/10",9,2,5,20 February 2017
Sully," An interesting look into the psyche of an everyday man who inadvertently becomes a hero
","Sully is a biographical drama film starring Tom Hanks and directed by Clint Eastwood. Based on the true story of veteran airline pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger, the film is a nice tribute to its title character and the people he saved.Late in the afternoon on January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 departs from LaGuardia Airport in New York to Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina. Three minutes into the flight, the plane is struck by a large flock of birds, which seriously damages both its engines. The quick thinking of pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) results in the plane landing in the middle of the freezing cold Hudson River. All 155 passengers and crew survive the crash landing and Sully is hailed as a hero by the media. However, Sully feels overwhelmed by the sudden fame he has received and to make matters worse, an official investigation is opened over whether or not Sully should have acted as he did or if he recklessly endangered the lives of his passengers.Featuring another solid performance by the ever-versatile Tom Hanks and careful direction by Clint Eastwood, Sully is an interesting look into the psyche of an everyday man who inadvertently becomes a hero. The audience always feels connected to Sully's plight as a reluctant target of the media and the post-traumatic stress he goes through in the aftermath of the crash. The only major issue I had with the film is that the supporting characters did not have much to work with. It just seemed like most of their dialogue was there merely to enhance the character development of Sully himself rather than to bring a different perspective to the story.I rate it 7.5/10",8,2,4,8 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," A successful return to the series' horror/sci-fi roots
","Alien: Covenant is the sixth installment in the Alien franchise and the sequel to the 2012 film Prometheus. Once again directed by Ridley Scott, this film marks the series' successful return to its horror/sci-fi roots that has been absent for some time.In the year 2104, the crew of the colony spaceship Covenant receive a radio transmission from a nearby uncharted planet and decide to travel there to investigate. Upon arriving there, they discover that the planet appears to be perfectly habitable and an ideal place for possible human colonisation. However, after closer inspection, the crew make a terrifying discovery that this seemingly perfect utopia is not what it seems on the surface.Expanding upon some of the philosophical themes first brought up in Prometheus and even answering a couple of confusing questions that film previously raised, Alien: Covenant is a worthy entry in the franchise and a huge improvement over what the series was turning into. Director Ridley Scott makes full use of the scenic planetary landscape to make this environment believable and realistic for human habitation. The threat of the Aliens feels real and the tense atmosphere makes the danger feel like a real possibility. This film also has a great deal more blood and gore effects than its predecessors, but most of it seems like tacky CGI rather than practical effects, I still miss the old practical look and feel of the original films. Like with Prometheus, most of the human characters are flat and uninteresting. It just seems as though most of the development went into the android characters of David and Walter (both Michael Fassbender) rather than the human crew.I rate it 8/10",8,36,72,11 May 2017
The Martian," A welcome return to form for Ridley Scott.
","The Martian is a science fiction film starring Matt Damon and directed by Ridley Scott. I'm a big fan of Ridley Scott's work as a director, but I feel that most of his recent films have been very hit and miss. However, The Martian serves as a firm reminder as to why I am a fan of him in the first place. Not since Interstellar have I seen a sci-fi movie this thought-provoking or cleverly written.After an intense sandstorm devastates a manned mission to Mars, the crew are forced to abandon the desolate planet and astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead and left stranded. Unbeknownst to the crew, Watney survived, albeit injured from the storm, and tries to find ways to survive the inhospitable climate of the red planet. Being a botanist, Watney figures out how to grow food for himself out of the crew's leftover vegetable supplies and uses his scientific knowledge to create water using hydrogen crystals and oxygen from the crew's base camp. However, these supplies can only sustain him for a matter of months as a rescue mission from Earth will take 4 years to reach him. Watney must find a way to signal back to Earth that he is alive and is in urgent need of rescuing before he runs out of food and water.Despite its somewhat bleak tone of survival in a hostile terrain, the film still manages to have its fair share of funny and heartwarming moments, which are seamlessly intertwined into the film's more dramatic scenes. Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the wisecracking, yet intelligent astronaut Mark Watney and his positive attitude toward his survival is what keeps us invested in the story. The rest of the cast are great too, which includes Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara, Jessica Chastain, and even Donald Glover from Community. I was also particularly pleased with the film's pacing, there was never a moment that felt rushed or slow and boring. This is a welcome return to form for the legendary director Ridley Scott.I rate it a solid 9/10.",9,155,267,15 October 2015
