Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the most underrated films in history
","I saw the Phantom Menace for the first time when I was 5 years old, and I remember being blown away by what I had watched. It was fantastic through the eyes of a child, something George was clearly trying to do. Now I am an adult, and watching it through the eyes of one, I can see all the mistakes, but that does not make the movie bad.For one, Star Wars has always been a series that has been aimed at children. Yes adults like it also, but Star Wars is not just popular for its films, but for its video games, toys and books. Most of which are for children. This film was great and it showed one of the best adventures of the 90s. When people complain about this film, their excuse is usually the same: too much CGI, poor acting and poor writing and poor direction.Yes the CGI is a bit dated, but it was really spectacular in some scenes. The acting was great in this film, as it was in the next two. The only actor who didn't give the best, was the young Jake Lloyd. It would be unfair to criticise the performance of someone who was a child at the time, of course he was not going to give a Al Pacino performance. The writing is OK, I guess, but really ask yourself this - what Star Wars film has good writing? None. They all have fantastic stories, which is why people love these films so much.George did a great job at expanding on his already loved saga. He gave us new worlds, new characters and showed us the Jedi Order, something we have been wanting to see for a long time. This film is a joyful adventure, with a great story.The character of Jar Jar is often another point of hate from 'older fans'. 'OLDER' fans. To a child, Jar Jar is a funny, clumsy stupid alien who acts insane, much like many Disney cartoon characters. I have a child of my own, and she thinks Jar Jar is hilarious, she is always pointing and laughing at him. THIS IS WHAT GEORGE WANTED! This film will always be criticised by people who just don't like it, or don't want to like it. But this is not a bad film. It starts of an adventure which would eventually lead to episode 6, and the future movies. Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace is a great film and a fantastic science-fiction movie.9.6/10",10,19,28,20 August 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A great war movie and an interesting Star Wars film
","I have loved Star Wars since as long as I can remember, I love every single movie, 1-7 all of them. I was very hyped to see this film, and I was not disappointed. This is a great movie, with some epic moments, but also some minor complaints.First of all, the look of this film is absolutely brilliant. From the mixture of particle effects, mixed with CGI, from the colour, the look, the cinematography, is all brilliant, with no faults at all. It feels very much like a part of the original trilogy, but some aspects come straight from the prequels too, which I am thankful for. The make- up, the production design, to the sound effects, are all done to perfection. But by far the greatest thing this film has going for it, is its visual effects. BY GOD ARE THEY AMAZING! I could not fault one single frame which held CGI, it is done so dam well. There are two motion capture characters in this film, and they are done so well it will leave you completely shocked. You know they aren't real, because well, without spoiling anything, the actors are either too old or dead, but it is just fascinating how they achieved this.Now for the characters and story. Each main character in this film is done very, very well, with all if them having their own personalities and traits, and all bring something to the table. Many critics have moaned (as they always do) about stupid things like them. The characters are great, yes some of them are given no backstory at all, but they are so good to watch, you don't care.The story is very well done, and if you have seen episode 4, you know what is going to happen, but it is done so well, and keeps you invested. Now I know everyone wants to know about Darth Vader, and I will say this, he has two scenes ... yes that is it ... two bloody scenes. However, these are very, very good scenes. Hearing Darth Vader speak gave me goosebumps, and I wanted to cry from all the epicness. He has one outstanding scene, which I won't spoil, but it was ... ahhhh soooo gooooooood!I have few complaints, but they do not necessarily effect the movie, itself, one is that there is no opening crawl. For a kid who goes to see this movie, they will be very confused why there is no crawl, nor the Star Wars main theme, yes that's right, no Star Wars music blasting in you face, which brings me to my next complaint. The music is ... disappointing. There is not one memorable score in this film, not one at all. It is shocking how, bland it is, when the composer is an Oscar winner, who has done great work in the past. Every Star Wars film has dozens of epic scores that you find yourself humming after hearing, this had none. The next is the ending, the ending is pretty dam crap.The movie ends to absurdly and fast that I was asking myself, right whats next then? But then you could just answer, go watch episode 4, because it ties directly into it.This movie is great, it is slightly better than Force Awakens, but I would rank it behind, Revenge of the Sith, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. After watching this film, it gives A New Hope more meaning and depth, and the next time I watch it, I will be more engrossed than I ever have been because of this movie.9.4/10",9,3,13,15 December 2016
Passengers," Highly underrated
","When I first seen the reviews of Passengers I held off watching it until it came out on DVD, and after I finished watching it, I was very surprised at the bad reviews. This is not a bad movie, but also not a great one either.The movie starts off very, very well with some absolutely spectacular set pieces, visuals and sound. I haven't seen set pieces this good since the Empire Strikes Back. They truly are a work of art. In the opening we are introduced to Chris Pratt's character, Jim. And in this first act of the film, Chris gives without question his best acting ever. Not only because of how good he is here, but how he breaks out of his usual typecasting funny, clumsy loon, who makes a fool of himself, here he is an isolated mess, with a very Jesus like look. This in my opinion was the best part of this movie, as it deals with what we all fear most, being alone. The second act changes from a drama to a romance movie, when Jennifer Lawrence's character Aurora is introduced. I really believed Jennifer in this role, her character was well thought out and I wanted to know more about her background. The chemistry between Chris and Jennifer was flawless, they truly worked well on screen, which I was glad for. If not this movie would have fell flat on its face. This is however, where the movie slows down a lot, and may turn a lot of people off. It gets bogged down in very corny romance, and I must say, very steamy sex scenes for the rating it has. It's not a bad section of the movie, but I really did think it got very slow and predictable.The third act changes into a thriller, and is handled very well. While I'm no science expert, I think some of the space scenes were a little far fetched and during this section we are introduced to Laurence Fishburne's character, who was pretty much just there, he doesn't do much at all and his underdeveloped character didn't have anything interesting to do at all. Passengers is a very underrated movie, and it irritated me greatly about its reviews, even more so when the piece of trash Ghostbusters 2016 got more positive reactions by idiotic critics. This movie won't be for everyone, some will hate the slow paced romance, but if you like that, this movie will please you.8.3/10",8,1,3,16 October 2017
Suicide Squad," Decent, but messy
","First of all, the critics have been very harsh on this film, it is not as bad as people are making it out to be, but it is not a great film either. It is entertaining, but messy as hell. The editing in this film is dreadful, and like Batman V Superman, you find yourself watching it, and know instantly that something is missing. They must have cut a lot out of this film, as some scenes make little sense, and jump between each other, making it quite confusing.It does start off very well, the first twenty minuets are very good. The Batman cameo, and Deadshot character was very well done. Will Smith did a great job as he carries this movie. His charisma is perfect and suits his role very well. Now Margot Robbie was ideal for Harley, she was perfect, everything she did was well thought out, and you truly believed that she was insane.The main villain in this film, is a little letdown. Without spoiling anything, the villain felt more like a video game boss. But the most interesting thing, is the Joker. Jared Leto is a fantastic actor and he was ... very underused. We were given the impression that the Joker would be a big part, as they kept his character quiet. While Jared was fantastic here, you truly believed that he was mental and loved Harley. There was some sweet moments with him, but he was given barely any screen- time. No one should compare Jared's Joker with Heath's Joker, they are two different characters. But Jared does a fantastic job at making you want to see more, and I hope we see him as a major villain in the future movies.This is a good film, but it is all over the place. I want to see a completed version of the film, which I believe would be a lot better. 5.4/10",5,0,3,7 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It tries to fix an impossible problem, and does, and doesn't succeed at it
","Star Wars:The Rise of Skywalker was supposed to end the 9 movie saga, bring a close to one of the most epic movie series of all time, beloved by millions across the world... At times, it manages to accomplish this, but in the end, fails. I will however defend J.J Abrams as much as possible, I salute the man, for trying to at least, satisfy the fans. I will try not to repeat what most people have said, but the Last Jedi is responsible for this movies failure. You can tell a story was set up in episode 7, and that episode clearly had a path, and episode 8 rewrote the path, and now we have what we have. The sequel trilogy could have been a remarkable adventure, with out old trio of heroes alongside the new, but it never does this. It just felt like another generic visual blockbuster, with no heart, no soul, no imagination, and no respect for its fanbase.The Rise of Skywalker tried to hard to end the series, and this isn't a bad movie at all. I will look at it the way I look at Game of Thrones season 8. Something with potiental, that failed to deliver, not because of the cast, or crew, but from the ones who lead it all. The producers of this series should have had a goal, a planned out storyline, but instead, they went off course, and steered us into a ditch. This movie has a lot of good points about it, there are truly some gut-wrenching moments, one with Chewbacca scream, that had me fight a tear. The movie is filled with so much, it could have been great, but was bogged down with a story that doesn't fit in with the rest of the series. Bringing Emperor Palpatine, may have been their plan the entire time, but he wasn't even hinted at, previously, not once. His presense should have been looming over all our heroes throughout the trilogy, but instead he shows up randomly, like .... hey folks. The Leia scenes were good, a little weird, but I think it's in our brain to see it strangly, due to Carrie's sad death, it makes me wonder what they had instore for her. The visuals are brilliant, the acting is great, Adam Driver is clearly the standout here. The music .... I'm not sure of. John Williams' seems to have been shoved off at the side in this trilogy, while, in episodes 1-6, you felt his music. It was like a character in itself. The music in here, is difficult to even listen to.Episode 9, is a good movie, not great, but I didn't hate or despise elements that I did in the previous movie. But this film is a mess, it tries too much. I don't blame it though, because of what has come before.

Aliens," One of the greatest movies of all time
","Aliens, sequel the critically acclaimed Alien is quite possibly the best sequel of all time. Not only does it do the original film justice, but improves on it on so many levels.For one, Sigourney Weaver gives one of the best performances of the 80s in this epic horror flick. This is one of the few films that is difficult to fault, due to its great direction, writing, acting, visuals, sound and soundtrack.Straight from the start you are put into a thrilling movie that has not one down time, and is constantly on the movie, with perfect pacing throughout. James Cameron does a masterful job at creating suspense throughout the course of the movies runtime, and manages to craft some of the best actions scenes in film, something you rarely see in films nowadays. This movie is highly recommend for those who love both horror and action, as this movie blends with genres perfectly, as Aliens is one of the greatest movies of all time. 9.4/10",10,0,2,26 April 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," One of the greatest superhero films of all time
","I have never been a full X-Men fan, I have enjoyed each one of them, with the exception of Wolverine Origin (which was garbage). First Class was a great reboot of the franchise, but I never thought the sequel to that would as as great as it was.Right off the bat, you are thrown into a fantastic story-line that draws you in. Seeing the old cast along side the new, was spine-tingling. The futuristic themes of this film work very well, and the film is edited perfectly to merge and blend the past and future. There is next to no complaints I have about this film, while this isn't the realistic superhero movie you would see in the Dark Knight trilogy, this film most definitely matches it in terms of emotional impact and entertainment,The acting has never been so good in an X-Men film like here, every single actor in this film gives a top-notch performance, with James McAvoy being the stand-out. Jennifer Lawrence is also fantastic here, and it was good seeing her as the character blue Mystique rather than Jennifer we see in the first one. It is difficult to say who the main villain of this film is, as there is many to choose from, but Magneto does a great job.Quicksilver is in this movie, and despite his limited screen-time, he gives the best scene in the film. The action is also very good as well, with no shaky cam, and no serious fast cuts. This is the best X-Men film so far, and a perfect superhero movie.9.6/10",10,2,3,12 June 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Very entertaining
","First of all, this movie is directed brilliantly, the Russo brothers do a fantastic job and translating the comic into a very entertaining movie. The writing is fantastic, and the actors, with Downey being the highlight, and the movie makes you switch between both sides, and makes it difficult to decide on which team to stand with.Now Tom as Spider-Man, is the best choice the Marvel Movies have made since Downey as Stark. He is fantastic here, despite his limited screen time. He really shines as the web-slinger, and his comedic performance does not seem forced, and it ends making you hungry to see more of him. The other characters are also very entertaining to see, and there is not one dull moment with them, and their chemistry is fantastic, one of the major things that keep this movie on its feet.The best thing about Civil War, is the action, this is some of the best action I have seen in a movie in a long time. There is some shaky cam in some parts, however it can make some of it hard to make out, but also very effective.Now for the bad stuff, first, the runtime. It can seem very long at times, with some scenes added feel shoehorned in there, to make the movie a little longer. But the worst aspect is by far the CGI. I know - all the other marvel movies have had decent special effects, but this one, not so much. Some scenes look OK at best, but other times, specifically the Black Panther, you can tell how fake he is. The leaping, the explosions, and even some of the powers look so bad. Robert's CGI head is also very noticeable on his Iron Man suit without his helmet, and it distracts every time you see him like this. The green screen effects are also very bad, and you can see it's fake from a mile off.Other than that, there is nothing else bad about this movie. It is better than most Marvel movies, behind only Guardians of the Galaxy. 8.4/10",8,11,24,29 April 2016
Twilight," A entertaining movie, but very cliché
","I am possibly one of the few guys in the world that actually enjoys these movies, and their book counterparts. This movie is very entertaining and has a good story, buried under that cheesy poor writing. The movie starts off with promise, and its visually appealing, it is shot rather well. But when the movie goes on it changes and their are some truly cringe worthy moments. The dialogue here is dreadful at times, and you could find yourself looking away, or even skipping past it. The acting is not bad either, Kristen Stewart does a very good job here, while her performance dies over the course of the series, you can believe her acting here. Robert Pattinson does a mediocre performance as the vampire Edward Cullen. Their chemistry on camera is good, but the best as it could have been, but enough to understand their relationship. While this movie does have its moments, like the baseball scene, the fight scene at the end and the Dance scene. It is filled with ridiculous writing, not even the book has this much terrible writing. The portrayal of the vampires is what people will despite the most, they have no fangs, they don't burn in sunlight and they are almost superheroes. This movie fails to add the creepy atmosphere a vampire movie should have, and does a poor job and making you fear the main antagonist of this film.This movie is not bad, and if you can look past the bad writing, and enjoy it for what it is, you could respect it more. Some people however will hate it, which is understandable. 6/10",6,1,3,13 May 2016
The Favourite," A bland and boring film with a remarkable performances
","The Favourite tell the story of the later years of Queen Anne, a monarch not often shown on the big screen, and the character shines with the brilliant performance of Olivia Colman.The beginning of the film is very good, as we see the back and forth between Emma Stone's Abigail and Rachel Weisz's Lady Sarah. The rivalry between these two was very well done, and it played for some great comedic scenes. However after this passes, the movie slows down even more, and becomes boring. As nothing really happens afterwards, other than a few political scenes.This is the type of movie a selected number of people will love and respect. It has good writing and is acted brilliantly. However it is very, very slow. The entire film takes place in the Queen's Palace, and we are treated with very well done production and costume designs, but we revisit the same rooms and halls, and it gets bland. Also this film is categorised as a comedy, and it tries so very hard to be one, some of the comedy works, others doesn't. A movie like this should have been a straight up drama, considering the topic, and the performance by Olivia, which is one of the best of the year. But it plays for laughs way too much, and feels goofy and over the top at times.Other than the great production and costumes, the movie also has a very unique cinematography style, something I haven't seen in a film before, it uses strange angles and zooms, and relays a lot on long takes, which is always a plus. Most of the other background characters are wasted, but do provide some comedic scenes.The Favourite is a very well made movie, just a boring one. If you enjoy movies like this, you will find great entertainment in it, but if you don't you will find yourself checking your watch.5/10",5,1,6,7 January 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," A good film, but expected more
","This movie had a difficult task, trying to top 'Days of Future Past' which in my opinion is one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, while this film was good, it fails on many aspects that made the previous one so good.The acting here is very good, there is not one bad actor here. Michael Fassbender is the star performer here, the scenes in which he was the centre of, always turned out great. But I would go as far to say, we did not see enough of him. The movie follows the heroes more, but does do a great job at showing the threat of Apocalypse. Oscar Isaac as the main villain was a brilliant choice. From the trailers and posters, I believed that he would be over the top, but instead he is intimidating. The story on the other hand, is not too compelling. X-Men, X-Men 2, First Class and Days of Future Past, have all had great stories. They were all perfectly paced, with enough going on to keep you both, invested in the main characters and everything else that's going on. This film is a mess. Some characters were a complete letdown, we were made to believe that they would be kick-ass, but instead they stood in the back not uttering a word. I would say that I was not greatly disappointed in Jennifer Lawrence character here, while she was important, I believed that she did not suit well in the hero role. Mystique is a villain, and she should stay that way. By having her being an hero this time around, does seem right.This film is not bad, the critics, yet again don't know what they hell they are doing, with their ridiculous reviews, but this is not even close to being as good as the other X-men films we have had. With the exception of Origins: Wolverine (shivers). Go see the film is you are a fan of the series, and you will possibly like it, but don't expect it to be as good as the last one.7.4/10",7,14,23,17 June 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi is good, but I expected so much more
","Star Wars the Last Jedi is the only Star Wars film that I felt slightly disappointed with. While this film is not bad, and some of the harsh criticism this movie faces is a bit too much. However, this film is massively flawed and underwhelming on so many levels.Now the first ten minuets or so of this film are brilliant, the open crawl, then straight into a very entertaining space battle. It was all Star Wars and everything I wanted in the Force Awakens. Although this scene also has a ridiculous unrealistic part. We all know that Star Wars is the most unrealistic space opera in the world, but here they took it too far. When the Resistance Bombers just drop their bombs, and a character is openly lying on a ledge while space is right under her! This was ridiculous.The movie slowly takes a turn when we meet Luke Skywalker, which I despised. We waited two years to see the encounter with Luke, and some fans have even waited decades to finally see the legendary Jedi Master. In the now Legends, Luke was a badass, wise and powerful. In the trailers they built up this great meeting between Rey and Luke, and we got ... that! It was so Disney to completely wreck that scene. I don't know what was going through their heads when they thought that was a good idea. The film begins to fall a little, it becomes filled with plot holes, slow paces scenes and a lot of unnecessary side quests. The introduction of Vice Admiral Holdo was good, I enjoyed her character, despite her being an overall weak character. Laura Dern does a good job with what she's got, but her character was bland. They could have easily replaced her with Admiral Ackbar, who we have all loved since Return of the Jedi. The character of Rose is ... okay at best, I think she too, was weak and had little to do other than just be there. DJ was useless and did little to nothing. All these things bring this film down even more. Phasma also was dreadful, and had less to do this time around than the last movie, then there's Snoke.I was so looking forwards to seeing this character in person, Andy Serkis is one of the greatest actors in the world, and his motion capture skills are unparalleled. And while he is brilliant and intimidating in the role, Snoke is also underused and useless, only providing a story plot point for our main characters. However one of his scenes led to one of the greatest action scenes in all the movies.But my biggest issue with this film is by far, how the treated Luke Skywalker. They ruined his character in this film. He was iconic, loved by millions, and they wrote him like that! What a bloody waste. However they gave Leia the honourable tribute to Carrie Fisher, and I truly loved her character in this movie. And I know some had an issue with her 'scene' in the movie, I loved it. I thought it was a beautiful scene that showed just how powerful she could have become. Our main heroes are Rey and Kylo Ren who are for the most part, doing nothing for most of the movie other than talk. Their stories get more interesting as the film goes on. Finn is just Finn, and Poe has a lot more to do here as well. The Last Jedi is a good film, but a heavily flawed Star Wars film, it lost all the magical adventure feeling of the previous movies. Yes, I even like Episode 1 more than this. But despite its flaws it is entertaining, and has some moments of brilliance, and a breathtaking soundtrack by the great John Williams, but this didn't feel like Star Wars.7.3/10",6,1,5,25 December 2017
Logan," A beautifully powerful movie
","Logan, the final instalment in which we will see Hugh Jackman, and I must say what a send off! Right off the bat, from the first minuet the film opens, you just know that this film is going to be different from the previous X-Men movies, with the exception of Deadpool. It is violet, and they do not hold back.The violence in this movie is used very well, and not just there for the sake of making it gory. It felt good seeing Logan slash people to bits, and actually see the ferocity of the character. Like we haven't seen since X-Men 2.The story of Logan is brilliant, and it is very emotional and powerful. Not only is the banter between Logan and Charles perfect, but the acting is ... gold. I would go on to say both actors deserve Oscar nominations for their efforts, because it is that good. And it is not just them, the young actress Dafne Keen gives a breakthrough performance, and her acting is totally believable, and she acts very well along side these other two power-houses. Every performance is great, from the minor characters, to even the group of kids. There is nothing to fault about the acting at all.However, this movie is not for everyone. While X-Men fans will love it, some may find it to be a little slow, especially when compared to all the other instalments. This is not action packed, it's slow and takes time with the characters. There are parts that are very slow, and halt the story a little, but not enough to make it become boring.Aside from the overall story and acting, the technical achievement of this movie is its best aspect. This movie had a budget of $97 million, and it looks beautiful. From the fantastic cinematography to the visual effects. It just shows you that you don't need a massive budget to pull a movie this powerful off. Look at Wolverine: Origins, $150 million, and that movie looks like it was made by a bunch of amateurs. Overall, this movie is fantastic. I would say it is one of the best in the series, but not the best, I think Days of Future Past still holds that spot, but this is one of the better ones. 8.4/10",8,0,5,18 March 2017
The King," A good movie, but also....boring?
","Let me just say, I think this is a good movie, the production, the directing, writing and acting are all brilliant, but the movie is also very slow, and drags a lot during the first and second acts, for the most part. With a runtime of nearly two and a half hours, something that begins to bore you that soon into the movie, that is a problem. The only thing that kept from from turning it off, was the amazing performance of Timothée Chalamet - despite his consistent whispering throughout the film.The third act is where the movie really takes off, and we get a very intelligent, and well shot action scene. It was very similar to the Battle of the Bastards from Game of Thrones, and it served the movie well. The music in this film is also very good. One of the best things about this movie, was none other than Robert Pattinson. Who would think the emotionless vampire from Twilight would come so far. He shines here (pun not intended), despite his very minimal screen time. His French accent was also very good, I did notice a few off words here and there, but other than that, he was an intimidating villian to the movie. I just wish we got more of him.However, my biggest complaint, and anyone who has seen the trailer or the news, is that the movie kind-of tried to set itself up to be a romance. Well, that's what I got from it. There is literary no romance in this film at all, and Henry's love interest doesn't appear until very late into the film.Despite it dragging in tons of places, the King is still a good movie, abit very slow. If you don't mind those kind of films, then you will find a great deal of enjoyment from the King, if you are expecting an action-packed war film, or a love-stricken romance, this isn't your movie.6/10",6,1,5,3 November 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," One of the best MCU sequels!
","I didn't go into this movie with very high expectations, mainly because I was one of them fools who valued a critics opinion beforehand. But I was very surprised once I walked out the cinema. This movie is brilliant, far better than I expected it to be.Guardians of the Galaxy is my favourite MCU movie, it was funny, mature and visually breathtaking, this film is no different. From the very first scene, we get a look at how the Guardians work with each other, and the chemistry between all the characters is done to absolute perfection. My least favourite character from the first movie, Drax, is now one of the best characters in the entire franchise, he shines in this movie, and has some of the best lines in the film. Also, Baby Groot - just wow. I wasn't expecting them to have handled him so well, he wasn't over the top, or trying to be too funny - he just was!Like all Marvel movies, this is visually stunning, with incredible blue/green screen effects, some of which are so well done it is hard to believe that most of this film took place in a studio. The make- up, the costumes are brilliantly done. Also the soundtrack, sound and very well directed action scenes.However, while this film is great, it does have its flaws. Unlike the first movie, this film takes place in either space or one planet. There isn't much going on in this film, aside from Peter getting to meet his father, that's it, with a few other sides things happening. I wasn't overly fond of the Nebula and the Gamora part, I believe it was forced in there, and didn't really add much to the overall story. But even better than the actual main plot of the story, the best part in the scenes with Yondu, he was incredible in this movie. Not only do we get more time with him, but his character has an emotional arc this time around.Every character has their time to shine in this film, and each has at least one epic moment. This would have better a better film than the first, if it was not from the rather slow middle-part, and some unnecessary scenes, but it is still one of the best MCU movies, and one of the funniest films of the year so far.8.2/10",8,1,6,1 May 2017
Joker," Unless you're rich, or somebody, the world doesn'tcare about you...
","The title says it all, that is the message I got from this movie after walking out of it. This movie, is the most realistic comic book movie ever made. It is so powerful, and so well made that at times I forgot I was even watching a movie. It was engaging, terrifying, and will probably give you anxiety by the end of it. As you follow Arthur throughout the movie, this is the type of movie that makes you hate society and the rich people who look down on everyone else in the world. Critics are giving this movie bad reviews because they are jumping on the media bandwagon, of believing that this movie is going to spark violance, without even praising the movie for being a movie. It is one of the best acted filmsI have ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of the decade as Arthur Fleck/Joker. His performance is so powerful, so realistic, that you could swear the character was real. I loved how in the beginning of the film, you see Arthur as this broken down man, who is ignored, and abused by everyone, to the legend that will be known as Joker. There hasn't been an actor to potray a psychotic character so convincing since Jack Nicholson from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (another actor who was brilliant as the Joker). Even the supporting cast all did brilliantly, from De Niro, to Frances Conroy, everyone in this movie gives amazing performances.This movie is beyond its time, I guarentee,if this movie had been made in the 70s-80s, it would be considered one of the greatest movies ever made. Everything about it screams classic. From the brilliant directing style from Todd Phillips, from the outstanding cinematography, and the heart-pounding soundtrack. There is nothing about this movie that has problems. Some may be a little turned off by it, they may find it disturbing, because of how real it feels, but you can't deny how well made this film it. The same guy who directed the Hangover movies made this ..... let that sink in. One of the best scenes in the entire movie, and I will not spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but there is a scene where Arthur is being spoken to, and the camera focuses on Arthur's face. It doesn't cut away, it slowly zooms in, and showed the powerful jawdropping performance by Joaquin. He didn't even say a word, yet his expression told a thousand words. It was at that moment, I knew this movie was going to be special.Now I know most people are going to compare Joaquin's joker, with the legendary Heath Ledger, and I don't want to compare them, since they are so different, yet similar. They both carry their own movies, and this is certainly the best film to feature the joker character since the Dark Knight, but this movie is much more personal than that movie.There isn't much that could be said about this film without spoiling it, but it is brilliant, and ignore any critic reviews you read, because they are all in the pockets of the ones who want to shut movies like this down. They don't care about issues like mental illness, portayed like this. They would rather see a man in a dress, and call it art. This movie is real art, it is extrodanry, and films like this come once in a life-time. I really hope we see more of Joaquin in the future, since he isn't a sequel type of guy. I really hope they make future movies, based in this universe, and doesn't make them lose their touch. Just imagine a Lex Luthor film made by these guys? Or Riddler, hell, even Penguin. But I do believe that we will see this Joker again, even more so since Matt Reeves is making a Batman movie. And people who are familar with his work, understand that he makes very real, very grounded movies, and his style would only fit a superhero universe like this one. Fingers crossed people!9.5/10... Masterpiece - 'I hope my death makes more cents than my life.' Best unspoken movie quoet ever.",10,1,2,7 October 2019
It Chapter Two," A great movie, that could have been even better...
","IT Chapter 1 was, in my opinion, a fantastic movie, not because of the scares (despite not having many), but because of the characters. The kids in that movie were just flawless, they worked so well off each other. I didn't think the grown-up versions wouldn't even come close to the chemistry that their younger counterparts had, and I wasn't wrong. Despite having a brilliant cast as the older versions, they just didn't have that same spark. Now this can be because they haven't seen each other in 27 years, most of them are estranged, and are living very different lives. Of course they wouldn't be the same as they were as children, but I felt this dragged it down a little. But despite this, every actor played their role perfectly, with the highlights being Bill Hader as Richie Tozier and James Ransone as Eddie Kaspbrak. These two were flawless as the older versions of their characters. The other actors, were also very good, but you would expect the likes of James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain to give great performances. And like the previous movie, Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd nails it as Pennywise. You can tell he inherited his family's trend of playing psychotic characters, because he is so good here, he is almost too good. The character of Henry Bowers was pointless, and added nothing to the film, he could have just been cut out completely.The movie has tons of pros and cons, with 'some' of the direction, cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting being the main highlights of the film. It is a stunning looking movie, from the lighting to the camera angles. But there are also tons of bad things about the movie, that stopped it from becoming better.One thing is that, it over uses CGI. While in some scenes, they clearly used practical effects, and make-up, because some of the creature designs are remarkable, its just a shame that some of the scenes that could have been terrifying, were filled with unnecessary CGI, especially at the end. Another problem I had with the movie, is its pacing. The movie seems to cut and dash between scenes, despite the movie being ridiculously long, like seriously, this movie is almost as long as Avengers: Endgame, that isn't normal for a horror film. The film drags in places, yet, I cant think of what scenes they could have cut out, because the scenes shown, were needed, but at the same time, while I was watching, I felt like they had cut tons of the film out. Some scenes were too quick, and felt rushed.But my biggest complaint was that it tried to put TOO much comedy in there. The first chapter was funny at times, but the comedy was well done, here there are some terrifying and thrilling scenes, and they are bogged down with quick one-liners. It ruined those scenes. Why the director did this is a mystery.IT Chapter 2 is a good film, it has some great moments, but also some bad ones. The scenes with the younger versions were the best scenes, and some of the creepy eerie moments, where Pennywise was tormenting children, were all perfect. But the film suffers from the typical shove CGI here, shove CGI there, and it really brings it down, as well as the pacing. But despite that, I still enjoyed it.7.6/10",8,4,7,7 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best in the franchise so far
","This movie blew my mind as a child, I waited for years and years to see the conclusion to the greatest movie franchise of all time, to put all the puzzles together.The very start of the movie blasts you into a great battle scene, with fantastic visual effects and an outstanding soundtrack. While yes this movie does have its faults, like some of the dialogue, and some scenes that feel rushed or out of place, but as soon as this movie shots you into the action or really emotional scenes, you forget about all that,One of the most annoying this is this film's ratings, only a 7.6 on here when it should be at least an 8.3 or 8.4. It is sheer entertainment, with a great performance from Ian McDiarmid (Emperor). This movie ties in all the movies nicely, and while it does still have its flaws, that does 'not' make it a bad movie. There are plenty of bad movies out there that don't get same hate that episodes 1-3 get. 9.9/10 brilliant film, my personal favourite of the franchise.",10,6,13,3 April 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A great movie experience, but not a great movie itself
","I went into this movie with very little expectations mainly because of the reviews it has. Now its score on Rotten Tomatoes is a bloody joke! Those ridiculous old critics who give this movie a bad rating seem to forget it is there to entertain, and it does just that. This movie starts out spectacularly, with Bruce (Ben Affleck) rushing through the city while it falls apart, great cinematography in this movie. Ben as Batman was a great choice, he was the best part of this movie by far, and his action scenes are very well directed. Henry as Superman was also very, very good, the pain he shows in this movie is so well done that he may eventually match the original superman. However, this is not a great movie. It is a bloody mess, the editing is choppy, some scenes make little sense, and if you have seen the trailers, you know that they wasted a great villain here. Doomsday should not have been in this movie, it was painful to see him wasted. The you have Lex Luthor, now Jessie is a great actor, but not suited to this role, he is more like the Joker than Lex. While his performance is not bad, he is no Lex Luthor. That is the main issues with the movie, but while this does drag its rating down to a 7, it is still a great experience to have in the movies. The visual effects are great, the fight scene everyone goes in to see, also does not let you down. 7/10 no where near as good as the 'Dark Knight Trilogy' but better than most superhero movies. On par with Man of Steel. Watch the movie, but don't expect too much.",7,1,5,3 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great .. but not Amazing
","I went to watch this film with very high anticipation, maybe it was because of this I was a little disappointed. While it is a great film, with things such as, particle effects, fantastic direction, brilliant visuals and outstanding performances from all members of the cast. However there are things that this film suffers from, that stops it from being the best that it could have been.1. The overuse of reused plot points: This was a major disadvantage to the film, as it felt way too much like Episode 4, and not just a little. Nearly every single story aspect has been taken straight from A New Hope, and it clearly shows.2. The Fast Pace: If there is one thing that Episodes 1-3, do incredibly well, is balance its pace out very well. This one is too much. There is almost no time to sit and talk about things, to let us viewers understand what is going on. They don't explore or inform us of anything that it is going on. Like why is that there? or who is he? They don't explain anything, which makes it confusing and because of its fast pace, it draws you out of the characters and the story.3. The Villains: Kylo Ren is a great villain, however the others, Hux, Snoke, and even more so Captain Phasma, are all let downs. They bring nothing to the story, other than standing there looking good. When they are on screen, they have almost nothing to do.4. The Soundtrack: Yes, I know, weird that a John Williams Soundtrack can possibly be a letdown. The soundtracks for every other Star Wars movie is fantastic, but this one, it does not have that many memorable themes, aside from a few. This movie is good, and a great entry into the Star Wars saga, but it was not as good as it could have been. Other than that, it is a Star Wars movie, and even having that title gives it a boost. 9/10 for overall score, it could have been a 10, if they slowed things down and thought of a more newer story.",9,2,38,23 January 2016
Warcraft," Average,. but not bad
","I am not a World of Warcraft fan, never really played any of the games, nor read up about its lore, but was drawn to this movie due to its fantasy themes, so my review is from a non fan, as I assume many people who watch this movie will be the video game fans.This movie is no way near as bad as many critics are making it out to be, but then again, critics are fools, and only believe a film is good if it is going to nab that best Oscar. However, while not bad, this film is not good either. It is a mess.The good things about this film, is its visuals. It is visually stunning to look at, with almost perfect CGI, gorgeous art direction, set pieces, and costume design. The actions scenes were very well done in some scenes, and the magic in this film is spectacular to see. There have been many fantasy movies that have never displayed magic like this. The acting is also good in this film, with each main lead performing as best as they could with the average screenplay.The main villain in this film is ... OK. I understand that he 'is' a video game villain, but they could have make him a little more realistic, rather than the over-the top one we got. The characters are so boring, that the only one that even draws you in, is the main orc, but even then, he isn't actually in the film as much as he could have been. He is the only character that has any development, as the others are pushed aside.Now the bad. The faults here do not fall on the director, who does a great job at converting a video game into a movie, but with the screenplay. The story is all over the place, and is a wasted potential. This film could have rivalled that of Lord of the Rings, if it had been written better. The characters are bland and boring, and the pacing is dreadful. The editing was also very poor, with many scenes cut together, seeming very mismatched, and don't make much sense.One of the major issues I would personally say about this film, its the film not giving us more to explore. I wanted to see vast wilderness, more of the beautiful cities, maybe some oceans, villages and towns, give us more to look at, as the film is visually breathtaking. Other than that, this film is not bad, it has its flaws yes, but it is an entertainment. It is one of the better video game adaptations, but don't go into this film expecting a great movie, or a dreadful one. Expect to be entertained, but that's it.6.5/10",6,1,7,10 June 2016
