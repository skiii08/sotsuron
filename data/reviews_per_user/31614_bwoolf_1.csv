Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Bait and Switch...
","I was a huge fan of Kill Bill: Vol 1.  I liked the excitement and story and enjoyed the mix of film styles. Kill Bill: Vol 2 is, on the other hand the most boring, self-indulgent piece of cinematic crap I have had the misfortune to sit through.  I can see why Quentin edited all this junk out of the first one and how he NEVER could have released them in the opposite order.  He spends endless amounts of screen time explaining/showing minutia which you at least hope will be useful later in the film, but ultimately turn out not to be.  His trademark style of mixing up the sequencing here is a total failure as he's constantly interrupting any chance of building tension or a story to go spend 15 minutes on some point that turns out to just detract from the film. Quentin desperately needs someone to stand over his shoulder and say 'NO' when he's in the editing room and decides to keep a scene running a solid 10 minutes longer than it should. If you feel Ridley Scott was obscenely self-indulgent in that travesty of a film Hannibal you will feel worse about Vol 2 as it doesn't even have a saving grace shock you ending that at least made Hannibal a water cooler topic. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",1,9,17,25 April 2004
