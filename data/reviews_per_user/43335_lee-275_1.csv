50 First Dates," Strong central performances, let down by irritating minor characters
","I went to see this film tonight without much hope. After all - Adam Sandler?! He gave a reasonably good performance in The Wedding Singer, but hasn't done much of note since.I have to say that he surprised me, and I was impressed by his strong, self-assured performance. Drew Barrymore also gave her usual accomplished performance.The central premise of the film - that Henry (Sandler) has to woo Lucy (Barrymore) anew every day due to her short-term memory loss - is an intriguing one, and handled extremely well by the two leads.However, the presence of Rob Schneider as a Hawaiian local and Sean Astin as a steroided-up fitness freak (complete with oh-so-funny comedy lithp) really dropped the quality of the film several notches.The ending (although Hollywood Happy Ending) was treated reasonably well, and helped prevent the film from being a complete waste of time.If only someone would realise that Schneider just isn't funny...(and neither is Walrus vomit)",Null,1,1,10 April 2004
