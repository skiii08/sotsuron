Ali," An exciting movie for boxing game and Michael Mann's fans
","If you are the fans of Michael Mann and boxing, you are sure to enjoy the movie,especially the fighting scenes.Michael Mann has proved again that he is a master of photography.This movie makes me learn more about Ali.Will Smith does a very good job.You can see his determination every minute.I must make mention of what a personality Muhammad must have been. He was very opinionated, but also stood up for what he thought was true. I remember one comment about Ali being that he was 'a loud mouth', and that was so true. I mean the way that he must have fired up his opponents before a fight, by his blind arrogance is truly amazing. Again praise must be given to the way that Will Smith captured Ali's personality, to be really coming 'the greatest'. It is a shame that Muhammad's life has been affected by the horrible 'Parkinson's disease'. Yet I am sure that he is giving a great battle against this.",8,0,1,3 May 2007
