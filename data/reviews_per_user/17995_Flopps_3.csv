Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," better than expected
","I can't believe all the negative criticism about this film.After all I've heard I expected to see a travesty of film making. but it all fits in as well as I could imagine. Let me explain. I don't want to give away any spoilers...There's some speculation about the nature of anakin's birth. I think it's rather obviously mis-understood by the jedi, rather than a mary-like-affair.The Idea that the film is more child like than the others is pathetic. It's more complicated (the senate's plot to overthrow  the status quo)than anything we've seen yet.Yoda does not sound like Fonzy bear (or what ever it's name is)...He doesn't crack one bad joke in the whole of the film.Anakin is going to be a real bad ass guy. There's no doubting this. So he has to be 'seen' by the emperor. Nothing too unlogical about the youths amount of luck there.And as for Jar Jar Binks...He might be irritating, but has anyone seen Hanks in Forest Gump or Reeves in the Matrix??? they're a hundred times more annoying...and they're real!!!!",9,0,0,23 June 1999
The Big Lebowski," funniest film ever
","For a long time my mind was divided between: Monty Python's the life of Brian or Monty pythons search for the holy grail as the funniest film ever. After seeing this latest Coen bros. production, I've had to change my mind. The drugs...the sex...the bowling and the carpet... All summed up when Goodman, looking very unimpressed, turns to the dude and says: 'eight years old Dude, eight years old!'",10,0,0,28 January 1999
Blade Runner," More complicated than it looks at first
","When I first watched this film I really thought it was good, and I thought I understood it.but after seeing it a few times more, and reading the book (do androids dream of robot sheep...or something like that) this film turned into a real mind buster.Do the figures add up? Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.Certainly worth seeing. Just trying to work out who's what is an experience in itself.",8,1,3,30 January 1999
