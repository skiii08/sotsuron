Walk the Line," Worth seeing for the music history
","This movie, which covers the period of Cash's childhood in Arkansas up to his public engagement to June Carter in 1968, among other things provides a good presentation of early Rock and Roll/Rockabilly/Country and Western music and its performance: it therefore will be of interest to anyone who follows these genres. The film is marvelously directed and acted with great sets, sound, and period costumes, however, those who like me find the typical music star lifestyle of 'groupie' sex, booze, drugs and bad behavior tiresome will probably find much of it tiresome. Cash fans may wonder why his famous song about his dressing only in black is omitted, even if his color choice is commented upon in a few lines of dialog.",8,0,0,10 March 2006
Troy," A few pluses, a lot of minuses
","Do blue-eyed flaxen-haired bronzed Brad Pritt and Diane Kruger really resemble Greeks, ancient or otherwise?  Can you really thrust a sword or a spear through pieces of armor plate, front and back?  Did Troy really look like this place?  You could go on, and in fairness there are a lot of questions about the historical basis of the Iliad on which this is very loosely based. How possible would it have been in Greece, for example, with its denuded hillsides (munched by goats) to find enough wood to build 1000 ships?  But back to the film. I agree with those who say Brad Pitt was the wrong person to cast as Achilles, while Peter O'Toole puts in a good performance but which in no way compensates. I also had misgivings about Orlando Bloom. Most of the other actors are adequate, nothing more.  The realism of the battle scenes varies a lot, sometimes good, sometimes ridiculous.  Ditto for the accompanying sound effects.  At times the film manages to resurrect fleetingly the feel of historical epics of the past ('Ben Hur', 'Cleopatra' etc), and that is one of the pluses.  Another plus is that some people might be inspired to investigate the classics and/or ancient Greek history.   But overall there are just too many faults and too much lacking.  5/10.",7,12,26,4 June 2004
L.A. Confidential," About as good as it gets
","In my opinion this is one of the top 10 movies ever to come out of Hollywood; just about everything - scripting, casting, acting direction - is faultless, and it has great period setting and feel.  Some didn't like Kim Basinger, but I think she was ideal for the part that she played. The theme of police corruption - those who are supposed to be the good guys but aren't - is a good setting for viewer involvement ...hint to budding scriptwriters out there. As other commentators say, if it hadn't been for the syrupy 'Titantic' (with its two awful lead cast members), this would have won the best picture Oscar for that year. It is one of the must-sees for anyone who aspires to making good movies.",10,1,4,25 June 2004
Forrest Gump," Silly but superbly crafted ramble through US history
","'How do we provide a US history lesson, warts and all, that is both entertaining and sentimental?' may have been the question the script writers/producers asked themselves and settled on a slightly mentally and physically retarded boy in (of course) bigoted Alabama who just happens to later be present in most of the momentous occasions in US history of the second half of the 20th century. Well he doesn't stay physically retarded for very long, quite the opposite. We get to see to see quite a few American icons (OK, John Lennon was English, but like some of the other notable people we see he got assassinated by a mad gunman.) The film manages to maintain a didactically neutral attitude towards the events and people it shows - the facts alone - but is heavy on sentimentality, which no doubt is good for box office takings. Inane it certainly is, but has excellent set design and cinematography, has good flow, and great songs on the soundtrack. Worth watching. 8/10",Null,0,2,5 September 2004
The Aviator," A movie of proportions befitting Howard Hughes
","This is one of the few movies of recent times that I came out of wanting to see again. While in no way a thorough docudrama of Howard Hughes' life (I recommend viewers at least read the IMDb biographic details of him before seeing the movie) we get a good insight into his complex nature, aspirations and mental problems. His two most most extravagant projects, the movie 'Hells Angels' and the Hercules aircraft get the major attention as we would expect, but it is a pity that his role in producing 'Scarface' receives only passing mention. Unfortunately I agree with those who say Leonardo di Caprio was the wrong person to cast as Hughes, but he does put in a good performance, while everyone else is superb; I particularly liked Alec Baldwin. Gorgeous sets, costumes and cinematography make it all a sumptuous visual delight which at no time becomes tedious. A must see.",9,0,0,8 March 2005
Before Sunset," Endearing despite being a talkfest
","The original film was based on something that happens frequently in real life - two young tourists from different countries meet on a train in a country foreign to both of them - and the film followed their developing relationship from there over the rest of the day in Vienna.  The premise of this sequel that he could then go on to write a best selling novel based on that, get media attention in the Shakespeare & Co bookshop in Paris etc., is rather far-fetched - and her showing up there is even more so.  Nevertheless it's the quasi-reality relationship thing which appeals.  What do they talk about, how do they interact, will they resume where they left off (well that's a safe guess) will they get passionate, have sex?  The setting of an amble through Paris, including a boat ride along the Seine, on a summer evening is also nice.  Julie Delpy is credited as one of the writers and you wonder how much is based on what she really thinks.  It's no surprise that it took only 15 days to film, but it is a surprise that $10 million was spent on it, given that much more complex films like 'Kissing Jessica Stein' can be made for $1 million, but I guess those involved with this don't come cheap.",Null,0,0,30 July 2004
K-19: The Widowmaker," Worth watching
","As another commentator says, this film isn't 'Das Boot', but it is still an involving enough story with enough drama to be worth watching.  Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are both good in their roles, as we would expect them to be, and the portrayal of other submariners seemed credible to me. Of course there is much underlying doubt about how close it all is to the way it actually happened, particularly as Hollywood isn't exactly noted for adherence to historical accuracy, but the basic facts aren't in dispute - scary stuff!",Null,0,0,17 November 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," A visually stunning landmark in cinema history
","More than almost any other director Kubrick appreciated that cinema should be a rich visual experience and here he provided it like no-one else had done before or has done since, from the opening landscapes to the metaphysical room at the end.  The only way to fully appreciate it is on a big screen; I have been lucky enough to see it on one measuring 60 x 30 ft. It was probably the first film to effectively present a solar system theme and the vastness of space. At the time the film was made, of course, the space program was in full swing and the actual first moon walk had yet to take place so it was extremely topical. But apart from a few technological things the film hasn't dated at all and is just as powerful now.  I think it should rate in the top 10 of all movies that have been made.",10,1,3,1 May 2004
Rock Star," Uneven satire
","The script of this movie contains a mixture of elements which are variously funny, silly and painful, and generally it is pretty schizophrenic. Although the subject bands play heavy metal, the soundtrack is mostly what is described as hard rock (there is a  difference) and composed by people with talent, unlike what is supposed to be the case with 'Steel Dragon'. Unfortunately the soundtrack doesn't compensate for the formula dross that the bands play.  There are things which are just so unrealistic (has the scriptwriter ever tried to conduct a conversation with someone at the front of a rock concert?) that they just have to be dismissed.  Other things - like the life of debauchery in between composing and performing - are certainly spot-on, but which is no cause for joy for the spectators..  The first half of the film is mostly a humorous send-up a la 'Spinal Tap', the second half becomes ponderous and quasi-philosophical.  The lead actor did nothing for me, but Timothy Spall is always good, and Jennifer Anniston is very easy on the eye, if not much else.",Null,0,1,12 March 2004
