The Legend of Bagger Vance," See this movie only if you really feel you have to!
","They say you don't have to be interested in golf to see/enjoy The Legend of Bagger Vance.  They say it's not a 'golf movie.' They're right: It's not a golf movie, but it's definitely a sports movie. Every step of the (dull and senseless) plot is utterly predictable, if you've seen at least one sports movie.The breakdown: Sports great falls from the top of his game, loses girl. Unknown Jesus figure helps hero 'find his swing.'  Hero has to redeem himself, recover his game, and win back his girl-- all while playing (for some unknown reason) in 'the biggest match of his life -- of all time!' against the worthiest adversaries of his game.The screenplay was absolutely horrible, but very funny at times. Unfortunately, the humor was completely unintentional.  The acting by the supporting cast was pretty shaky.  The cinematography and music were embarassingly cheesy.Partway through the film, I realized that it wasn't going to get any better, and I decided to focus on the eye candy, namely Matt Damon (and Charlize Theron is undoubtably a reason for any man to see this film).  The acting of the three leads wasn't too bad.  Will Smith was fairly charming as the title character, and Damon and Theron were fine in their own right, but chemistry between them was lacking.  This movie failed to hold my interest as a golf movie, a sports movie, a love story, or a tale of redemption.Go see The Legend of Bagger Vance -- just leave your mind at home.",4,0,1,5 November 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Scary, beautiful, and fun!
","Of course, every die-hard Tim Burton fan saw this movie opening night, but even one who shies away from horror flicks, like myself, will enjoy this cinematically beautiful film.  Critics have complained that the story deviates too much from the original Washington Irving novel (a timeless complaint), but the film has inspired me to read the book and I'll let you know which plot is more spell-binding.Johnny Depp stars in this thriller ('romance'? don't go expecting to see a love story) about the efforts of a cowardly police inspector, Ichabod Crane, to solve the mystery of the Headless Horseman (great casting: Christopher Walken) in late 18th century New York.  Depp fits right in with the mannerisms, language, costumes and setting of the period.  The actor is obviously comfortable with his character, giving an amusing side to an otherwise gruesome movie. Christina Ricci is also well-cast as the mysterious yet innocent Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of the town's de facto head. The supporting cast is also effective, with the exception of Miranda Richardson as Lady Van Tassel, Katrina's stepmother.  The actress' demeanor and poor delivery do not correspond with the period of the film.The story is well-visualized by Burton, whose cinematography is fitting. The combination of setting, foggy lighting and the absence of all color except red are put together expertly.  His teamwork with Danny Elfman, who wrote the music, is once again superb.  The dialogue, it seems, was especially written for Crane: Depp's character has the best lines, and the writing is in other places somewhat awkward.Sleepy Hollow is a great movie, and a must-see for all Burton, Depp, or Elfman fans.  Those with weak stomachs should probably avoid this film, as it is (very realistically) gory.",Null,0,0,22 November 1999
