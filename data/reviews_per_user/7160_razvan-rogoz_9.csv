The Equalizer," Dumb
","I'm sorry to say but this movie is borderline pathetic. It tries to be a combination between Taken and 80s action movies and fails at both. Why?For a single reason. I didn't sympathized with the main character, the hero. In movies like Taken, I could understand his motivations and drive because honestly, we would all do the same.But in this movie, the motivation itself is a cliché. I liked the villain more than the hero, at least the villain was sophisticated.Plus, this isn't Call of Duty. This guy can run, jump, fight, get shot three times and still be alright, fix his wounds with honey, defeat a team of special forces, kill a dozen people in the city and nobody saw anything or took his fingerprints and I could go on like this until tomorrow.The plot defies logic (in the final act, it would have been simpler to simply bomb the entire complex where the hostages were and they would be done with it), the hero is made to look very smart and resourceful compared to everyone else and generally, the movie is a bore.Look, Hollywood, this is 2014. Our Iqs increased a bit since 1990. Enough with the one man army plot. Enough with the 'good guy kills 100 bad guys' type of story. It is not realistic. Even the Matrix was more realistic than this movie. A similar movie was The November Man but at least that was a bit more realistic. By the end of this movie, I despised the hero, felt like I've lost two hours of my time and wished I saw something else instead.If you want to see something good, see Training Day instead. That is his BEST movie. Or watch Taken 1, 2 and 3. Or any other movie that isn't designed following the 1980 'Commando / Rambo' formula.",5,8,14,3 January 2015
World War Z," Not what I've expected ...
","I don't even know how to review this movie.First I was mad about how they are taking a book about the psychological effects of such a zombie war (and there was some smarts point in the book, believe me) and transformed it into the next '28 Days Later'.Then I saw the movie. Started well enough, good acting, clichés but well executed ones, a few predictable plot twists (actually, with the exception of one plot point, this may be the most predictable scenario ever written), good special effects and some variety.This was in the first 30 minutes. Then it started. * Unstable pacing. In some moments you just want to get it over it and it goes on and on and on. In others it ends way too fast. * The action scenes are predictable at least. Ranging from the Navy Seals to regular soldiers, from '28 days later' like scenes to 2012, they are predictable. Nothing WOW here, only well executed. * The movie is too long as it's stretched to be too long. For such a thin plot, it takes about 20 - 30 minutes longer than it should take. BUT wait ... when it finally picks up the pace after a painful 30 minutes (which should have been suspenseful) it ends.Yes, it ends. And then if from 0 to 1:39 was A to B, the ending is B - C - D - E - F ... you get the point. There were so many cool things that could have been included in the plot directly like the bombing of a football field, the battle of Moscow but no, you will only find them there.So this movie is a huge disappointment at least from my side. Why? Not because it's another zombie flick. I don't care. I've enjoyed almost all of them. There is nothing better than to see a dark, action oriented movie like Resident Evil. It's a disappointment because it builds tension and it builds it and it builds it and the release sucks.OK, so they find some kind of vaccine. Guess what? We knew that from the beginning since this was his mission. I wasn't expecting it with everyone dying.Brad Pitt's acting is good, actually very good. The characters are interesting - his wife, the Mossad girl, the Navy Seal, the smaller boss (general secretary of the UN), etc.However, it's not as exciting, not even close as in the trailers, it captures little to none of the book (simply detailing the battle for NY would have made for a better script), it's not really dark (I don't know what tone they wanted to strike - because it's neutral, nor dark or optimistic. While the characters are decent, it's hard to get attached to any of them and I'll stop here.I rarely write long reviews. I rarely write reviews for movies I don't like. But I can't understand how this got a 7.3 plus how it's so different from the trailers.",6,2,5,16 July 2013
12 Angry Men," Best movie of it's kind
","To be honest, I did not expected a lot from this movie. I knew that it was in the top 250 and that it was a cult classic. However, a lot of the top 250 movies were boring for me so this was not a strong indicator of quality.The only boring portion of the movie were the first 30 seconds. Afterwards you are thrown in a room where you can observe and understand human nature better than in 4 years as a psychology major.This is a movie about how our past, our jobs, our social, emotional, mental, economic contexts determine who we are. We have the guy who simply doesn't care. We have the shy guy who is very smart but influenced and by the end of the movie, gains confidence and courage. We have the passive aggressive guy. We have the wise guy. We have the aristocrat.We have 12 different personalities, thrown in a room trying to reach a single conclusion. And how they do that, each on their own is art. This movie is amazing, not only as artistic value but from what it can teach you. It is paced so well, not a moment longer, not a moment sooner. The actors are generally amazing and Henry Fonda played his role very, very well. Without trying to insult this masterpiece, it's like Big Brother but with a strong, very strong intellectual and maybe even philosophical background.",10,2,3,27 March 2013
Interstellar," Deserves #1 on IMDb
","Simply put it, this is a masterpiece.I had no expectations when I went to see this movie. The 'complaining' brigade on IMDb made this happen, since they are always unsatisfied.However, even if the action lost momentum in some parts and the movie is LONG (almost 3 hours), it is simply a masterpiece. From the story, to the acting, to the soundtrack (search 'No time for caution' on YouTube) to the bitter sweet conclusion, to the fact that 99% of the movie is actually scientific (and yes, I've searched that up), it is the best movie I have ever seen. If you thought movies like Inception can blow your mind, then watch this.",10,5,12,28 November 2014
Man of Steel," Actually good ...
","To say it upfront, it's not what I expected and this is a good thing. I've expected a Marvel like movie full of clichés, good vs. evil, morality vs. lack of it and so on.It was not. It came with a lot darker tone, similar to 'The Dark Knight', good CGI (actually, very good CGI), high production values, good acting and a relatively interesting plot.It's not a perfect movie, not by any standard. It takes a bit too long, it becomes predictable after a while and it ends without a bang.However, for all intensive purposes, it was time well spent. Superman is actually interesting here, not some perfect superhuman but a human with his own weaknesses and the battle scenes are on par with War of The Worlds.Go see it. You won't leave disappointed.",8,1,7,17 July 2013
22 Jump Street," Funny.
","I don't really know what to say about this movie.There were some moments in which I started laughing  and laughing  and laughing  and I couldn't stop myself. As far as I'm concerned, if a movie has a single moment that can generate that, it is a good movie.On the other hand, in a classic Scooby Doo fashion, the plot was very predictable. It was not hard to know in advance what was going to happen, almost scene by scene. So if you want some good laughs, rent the DVD. It is worth it. Alone, with someone else, sober, drunk, doesn't matter. There is at least one scene in which you'll feel like you're going to get sick from so much laughing. If you want a smart plot that will keep you captivated until the very end, this is not. This is the kind of movie that you consume to have a good time and that's all. Two hours after, you'll forget almost everything about it.",8,0,3,23 October 2014
Jurassic World," Fun
","Call me crazy, but I think I've enjoyed this movie ... even more than the first one.Now don't get me wrong. There are no philosophical questions here about nature and playing with DNA. No lesson about how not to force evolution. This is a summer blockbuster and that's about it.It contains action, comedy, mystery, a few good laughs and a few 'I wonder what is going to happen next' moments.I haven't seen the other Jurassic Park movies (except the original and the 3D release) but if you want an enjoyable movie which is not too deep nor that revolutionary, but well executed, watch it. I just wish that in the next sequel they'll move away from the formula. It would be interesting to see how dinosaurs escape on the mainland, not on the island. For better or for worse, there isn't a lot of tension knowing that they can simply bombard the entire island and get it over with.However, again, this is no Citizen Kane. It's the equivalent of Transformers or Independence Day on a quality level.",8,68,134,20 September 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," Funny & Smart (but not so scary)
","This is a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. From the ground up, it wants to include every possible cliché of horror movies possible.The way it does this is interesting. It is not like Scary Movie. Instead, it alternates between classical slasher horror with comic relief with an action movie vibe and with scenes that are so bad that they are good.As long as you take it for what it is, a great late night movie that makes fun of itself in some moments and becomes rather seriously in others, it is great and the ending is just brilliant.Btw, this is not really a horror film. It contains horror elements but for all intents and purposes, it is more of a comedy than a horror.",8,1,3,12 December 2015
Warcraft," Nostalgia is a dangerous thing ...
","Let me put it this way.At some point, World of Warcraft had 10.000.000 paying customers. If we take this plus everyone who bought Warcraft 3 and the other titles in the series, you've got a pre-sold audience for a best- selling movie.Movie adaptations of games usually are hit and miss. Resident Evil was okay but that's about it. Most are a joke. Warcraft though ... is okay, even good.The production value on this is very high. From the effects used to the editing to even the story, it makes sense. There are some small easter eggs that only WoW players will understand that are a nice add to the movie. It is not the next Lord of the Rings movie but it is way more than a way to capitalize on a video game.Why have I've paid the ticket for it? Nostalgia is dangerous. After spending tens of hours in Azeroth, I couldn't resist seeing it in a movie adaptation and I wasn't disappointed. Even if I barely remember the characters by name (they do sound familiar though), it stays true to the universe and the entire two hour was a roller-coaster ride, with hardly any moment to catch a breath.It is a perfect movie? No. It is one of the best video game adaptations ever made? Yes. I've seen most of them. This takes the first prize by a large margin. However, with a $160 mil budget, it was expected.And with an potential market of: 1. 4.5 millions from Warcraft 3. 2. 100 accounts created in WoW ...... You have a pre-sold market that wants to see it, no matter if it is good or bad. The thing is that it is actually good. If you also add the fact that there are many people who never played the games and want to see it, I don't doubt this will enter the top fifty best sold movies of all times. So yes, spend your $10 on it, it is worth it.",Null,3,6,26 June 2016
