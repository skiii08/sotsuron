Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," not good
","The creation of Jar Jar Binks was one of the most odious crimes ever perpetrated against the human race. Not only do I refuse to give this movie a single star, but I recommend that George Lucas face a military tribunal. When he is found guilty, he should spend the rest of his life confined in a prison cell with Jar Jar.",1,0,1,27 November 2001
