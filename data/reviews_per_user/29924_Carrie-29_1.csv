The Blair Witch Project," No fair!
","Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but this film is still stunning and unbelievably intense.   _Blair Witch_ makes seeing movies a real experience -- it so tests the boundaries of film reality and creates an alternate universe that, sure, is logically flawed, but really sucks you in.I, for one, have rarely witnessed the energy I felt in that theater with hundreds of screaming people.",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
