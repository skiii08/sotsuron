The King's Speech," The King's Speech
","The King's Speech takes place in late 1930's Britain and focuses on the monarchy of the royal family at the time. The current king is King George the 5th and when he passes on, the role of the king will go to one of his sons, either George, or his brother Edward. The film focuses on George though as he is married and has two daughters and in a lot of ways would like to become the next king of England, except his one struggle is the way he speaks. Since he was a young boy he developed a stammer and can not pronounce or talk at the same speed, or pronounce it the same as everybody else. With the current invention of radio becoming a big hit, George knows that he must learn to lose his stammer and so he is introduced to a speech therapist named Lionel Logue. George has seen different speech therapists before, so is very sceptical and unoptimistic that anything will be different with Lionel, but to his surprise, under Lionel's direction, he is getting better. Lionel who has a very unorthodox and unusual ways of doing things, connects with George, not only as his speech therapist, but as a good friend as well. This tale based on a true story is about their friendship and how in more ways than one, they are able to help each other out in life and as friends. Next to Mao's Last Dancer, I found The King's Speech to be the most uplifting and inspiring film of 2010. I think what makes it that way to me, is the fact that these two men, who in many ways are total opposites and how they are able to both reach each other and help each other out in life and how lasting and important their friendship is to each other and the beautiful and helpful times they will have together. The other inspirational part is about George and his stammer and how he is continually helped by Lionel to overcome it. We also see Lionel, working also as a friend to coach George, on the pressures of being in the limelight and in the royal monarchy and basically life itself. Along with Mao's Last Dancer, this is the type of film that warms your heart and makes you want to stand up and cheer after you have seen it. My favourite parts of the film were George and Lionel interacting with one another because in those scenes there is so much heart, human emotion and at times some very funny moments as well. The film's screenplay draws us back to the 1930's and instead of being a stuffy, or boring film, I instead found it to be so full of life and humour and so inspirational about who we can become as people and how the ones who are dear to us, can really help us out in the end and that friendships are a wonderful thing. The history aspects of this film were fascinating to me as well and of course the main point of George getting, or trying to lose his stammer was fascinating to watch because of the great character build ups and the way these characters interact with one another. It is a fantastically written film and the writing comes through with very good direction and of course excellent acting. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are terrific here as George and Lionel and they give so much human qualities to these characters that in any well done film such as this, you get to care for them and have your own sense of respect for them and just watching them is a complete and total joy. Colin Firth will win the Oscar for his portrayal of George at the Oscars in a few weeks and it is a well deserved win. The film with it's period piece settings are very suitable and enhance the historical aspects of the film and all the supporting actors do a great job here as well. To me though the thing that stayed with me and touched my heart was the message that with help from others be it friends, spirituality, or the ones closest to us, we can get help with the burdens, or things we have been struggling with and that every one of us does have one true great friend who can inspire us to go on and do great things and we can be at the side of that friend and go on to inspire them to greatness as well, no matter what field, age or any situation you are in. The King's Speech is a very entertaining film and works because of it's great direction, script and acting as well as the core messages of the film that will inspire us and warm our hearts. This is one of the best films of 2010.",10,0,1,14 February 2011
Black Swan," Black Swan
","Black Swan is about a young woman named Nina, who is auditioning for a new version of the classic ballet Swan Lake. Nina really wants the lead role in this part and she gets a lot of pressure from her mother Erica, at home as well as her strict and no nonsense teacher named Thomas. As Nina continues to practice and work herself to the brink of exhaustion to get this part, we soon start to see changes in her. When we first meet her she seems quite kind and gentle and in a lot of ways let's people push her over, but soon her friendly and forgiving attitude starts to go and we see Nina's personality change before our eyes as she grows increasingly more paranoid and eventually experiences, or drives herself to some kind of madness because of all this. I really wanted to like Black Swan. When it came out I could not wait to see it, but unfortunately I could have waited and it may have been best if I had never seen the film at all because I did not like it one bit. Basically, I felt the storyline of the film and just the overall look, feel and style of the film were all copied off of older Roman Polanski directed thrillers such as Repulsion and The Tenant. Having seen both Repulsion and The Tenant quite a few times, it was very easy to see where this film borrows (or should I say copies) from both of those two films with the story, certain aspects of what happen in the story and the style and direction as well. The film just did not feel fresh, or original. Instead it just felt like it was recycling these other two movies with only a handful of new footage that the writers came up with themselves thrown in. Basically this is a very ugly looking film and it was kind of awkward to sit through. As time passes during the film, events and situations get so bizarre that they are no longer fascinating, but instead over the top and ridiculous. Although, I never laughed out loud during this film, several people in the audience I was with did and I have to say that I could not blame there. There is not a moment of intentional comedy in the film, but because everything seems so forced, overly melodramatic and at times foolishly ridiculous, at times you can not help, but laugh by the mess of the whole film. Even the acting that is really getting praised I am still not sure what I thought about. Natalie Portman, who plays Nina and won a Golden Globe award for it last weekend does deliver a lot to the role because it seems like a really exhausting and physically demanding role and to learn ballet to play the part is also quite impressive. I wouldn't say it was a terrible performance, it's just that it never won me over in the sense that I really cared for Nina, or for the outcome of the film. I think if the film had been handled better and gone in a different direction, I probably would have felt differently. Barbara Hershey as Nina's mother was just campy, over the top and melodramatic acting that I did not care for at all, but out of all the performances I would have to say the two strongest, or at least the ones that I found worked were Vincent Cassel as Thomas and Mila Kunis as a rival dancer named Lily. They were able to do their parts without over acting them and by still bringing some intrigue and fascination to these characters. I think if Black Swan had been written and directed using original ideas and an original way of filming it, instead of copying Polanski films and using all the old horror clich√©s and tricks around, then with the talent involved, it could have been a really good film, but as it is it is uneven and I go as far as to say it is a mess in just about every way and one of the worst films of 2010. Oddly enough the film is being praised by a lot of critics and up for some major awards, which I just do not get at all. Maybe, I missed the point of this film, or perhaps the other critics did. After watching this film I do not care who is right, I just do not want to sit through this film again.",5,6,11,23 January 2011
Changeling," Changeling
","Changeling is a new film apparently based on a true story that took place in the late 1920's. The story focuses on single mother Christine Collins who lives with her nine year old son Walter. One day after returning from work, Christine can not find Walter anywhere and so she enlists the help of the police department, but the events that follow were to forever go down in history and show the corruption of the police department at that time, or at least in that city. Changeling is technically well made with great attention to detail trying to make everything look and feel like the 1920's, and I think they do a great job with costumes, sets and music, but other than for some technical achievements, I feel that there is little else to recommend with this film. First of all, I know that this film was based on a true story, but the events that take place in the film are so far fetched and unusual that while you are watching it, it feels more unpleasant than compelling. I also found a lot of problems with the script such as the many added subplots in the film that I personally did not think needed to be added. I also do not think the characters were as developed as much as they should have been and I don't think we as the viewer are given a chance to emphasize with the Christine character like we should be able to. Part of this problem comes from the many additional subplots I mentioned that take away from the real story, or at least what is supposed to be the main story that the film focuses on. I also found the acting in the film to be too overly melodramatic and over the top at times, so often it did feel quite unbelievable and forced which a true story film should never do. I also found the last half of the film exposing the corrupt police department went on way too long and the film started to hammer out a message that became repetitive and preachy and it was more tiresome than inspirational. The film could have lost at least 20 to 30 minutes of scenes that didn't particularly fit in the movie, or added much to it. The last half did drag very often and several times I felt like checking my watch to see what time it was and when this film would be over because it's one longer film where you can really feel it's length. I also thought the film gave too many instances of false hope to the Christine character and there was one too many scenes of her on the phone talking to the missing person's department and such that also could have been cut because it gives us the viewer false hope for the character and it just further made the film longer than it should have been. I think the main problem with this film is the script and had it been reworked over a little bit it could have been a very good film, but as it currently stands I can not personally recommend it.",7,5,11,2 November 2008
The New World," The New World
","The New World is set in 1607 and is about the Europeans who come across a settlement with several Native Americans and the one captain named John Smith falls in love with one of the Native American girls named Pocahontas. The film shows their relationship and also the conflicts and differences between the Europeans and the Native Americans. The film also shows Pocahontas's relationship with an aristocrat named John Rolfe as well. The entire film is shown in her point of view. Winner of The NBR Award for Best Breakthrough Performance By An Actress (Q'Orianka Kilcher, who plays Pocahontas) at The National Board Of Review. The New World is a very well made film. It's direction is good a long with performances, original music, cinematography, art direction, set decoration, costumes and makeup. But unfortunately the film itself is very slow moving and it gets to the point where it almost becomes boring. The film's director Terrence Malick is known for having gorgeous looking movies and this movie does look gorgeous and is very well made by the cast and crew. The film's script and pacing needed work however. Other than being a visual treat for the mind there was little else to enjoy about the film. The characters needed to have more going on and there needed to be a little more action or conflict in the film. I don't mind films with a slower pace that have a good story to it, but there is relatively no real concrete story here. Another problem I had with the film was I had a lot of trouble understanding what the actors were saying a lot of the time and that didn't help with the film either. I will give The New World a mild recommendation for it's look and the way it was so masterfully done, but as a film meant to entertain and provoke interest this film fails on that level. I do hope however that Terrence Malick begins work on another film soon because he is a gifted director with a great eye who just needs a better script the next time around.",6,0,2,2 June 2006
Scarface," Scarface
","This review of Scarface, is of the 1983 version directed by Brian DePalma. The film is about Tony Montana, who is a criminal from Cuba, who comes over to America. He starts out by working in a fast food restaurant and then soon ends up working for a drug lord in Miami. Tony, soon makes a name for himself and starts to deal drugs and becomes a crime lord himself. The film deals with drugs, deceit and violence as well. Scarface, has become a very popular film and has even become a cult film with a big legion of fans who quote the films and wear t-shirts of the main character. There is also a video game of this film in the works. I saw this film because of the numerous recommendations I got to see it and plus I'am a big fan of director Brian DePalma, but overall I was disappointed with the film. It was basically nothing more than a big budget Hollywood action film. The film had no character development so you hardly knew the characters and the movie jumps around a lot and often gets muddled in it's storytelling. The film also lacked Brian DePalma's great direction. He usually has a dark stylish look but this film does not have it. It looks too Hollywood and too mainstream. The film feels this way too. It really did very little for me. It was entertaining but I'm probably not going to see the film again or remember much of it in later years. This is a disappointment for DePalma but you do have your group of dedicated fans who would say that I'am dead wrong.",5,2,6,6 February 2005
Walk the Line," Walk The Line
","Walk The Line is based on the true story of the late music legend Johnny Cash. The film shows Johnny growing up on a farm to becoming a musical success, his rocky marriage, his dependency on pills, falling in love with his singing partner June Carter and becoming one of the most popular musicians of all time. Winner of The BSFC Award for Best Actress (Reese Witherspoon, who plays June Carter) at The Boston Society of Film Critics Awards; The BFCA Award for Best Actress and Best Soundtrack at The Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards; The Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, Best Performance By An Actor In A Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Joaquin Phoenix, who plays Johnny Cash) and Best Performance By An Actress In A Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at The Golden Globe Awards; The NSFC Award for Best Actress at The National Society of Film Critics Awards; The NYFCC Award for Best Actress at The New York Film Critics Circle Awards; The OFCS Award for Best Actress at The Online Film Critics Society Awards; The SFFCC Award for Best Actress at The San Francisco Film Critics Circle; The Satellite Award for Outstanding Actress In A Motion Picture Comedy or Musical and Outstanding Motion Picture Comedy or Musical at The Satellite Awards and The Actor Award for Outstanding Performance By A Female Actor In A Leading Role at The Screen Actors Guild Awards. Walk The Line has good direction, a good script, excellent performances by both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration and good costumes. The film is well made in just about every possible way and both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did their own singing for the film and each are so good in this film that they both deserve Academy Awards for their performances. They were two of the best performances I saw in a film from last year. The film is also very entertaining, full of spirit and energy, has an interesting and compelling story and is a fascinating look at these two lives of two music heroes. Some biographies do a lot for me and others don't have that big an effect on me. Walk The Line had a bit effect on me and I walked out of this movie loving every minute of it. Walk The Line is an excellent film and a great achievement from everybody involved in the film. One of the best films of 2005 and I'm sure that now all the studios who passes on this film are kicking themselves for doing so after seeing this great final product.",10,0,0,11 February 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan
","Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan is based on the Borat character from the television series Da Ali G Show. For those of you who have never seen it, Borat is a journalist from the country of Kazakhstan, who in sketch for the show would be in America interviewing different Americans and trying to learn about their culture and what makes their country different from his. In the television show everyone Borat interviews is real and for the most part much of what Borat says is unscripted and the response from the interviewee is not scripted either. This is very funny because Borat is so ignorant of American customs and always says and does the wrong thing which in our society may be deemed unsuitable, so it is very interesting to watch the person being interviewed squirm because they are uncomfortable and just their reactions to this unknowing and anti Semitic character. This movie is a full length feature of the Borat character who travels to America to make a documentary for Kazakhstan and along the way offends and makes a lot of people uncomfortable and at the same time exposes their ignorance and bigotry. A side story to the film is that while in America, Borat watches an episode of the television series Baywatch and instantly falls in love with actress Pamela Anderson, so he plans to go to California with his producer Azamat and marry her. Some of the film is probably scripted in certain scenes, but a lot of the scenes where we see the genuine reaction of those Borat interacts with is very funny. Sacha Baron Cohen who plays Borat and co-wrote the movie does an excellent job of playing Borat and he is so good at playing this character and doing on the spot comedy. A lot of the things Borat does in this film is outrageous and in our culture just so very wrong and he has a knack of picking the best people to pull his jokes on and with their reactions and Borat's crazy behaviour they are all pulled off very well. I laughed often during this movie and the audience was laughing a lot too. I don't think I have seen a crowd laugh at a movie this much in a long time. Because of Cohen's brilliant portrayal of Borat and the way this film works so well in the laugh department whether the film is scripted or not I ended up really liking this film. I must also note that I was a fan of Da Ali G Show and of the Borat character on there as well, so when I found out about this film I was very excited. Fans of the television show and the character will definitely like this film and even if you have never seen the series you can still enjoy this movie and you don't need to have seen the film to see this movie. I would also like to add that many may find the film offensive, but I personally found the film to have a message and I think this movie is against bigotry and trying to show the ignorance of people and that it needs to stop. Cohen himself is Jewish and he is definitely trying to make a point here. For a great comedic performance and non stop laughs with a great satirical kick to them I definitely recommend Borat and I hope when the Golden Globes come along that they will nominate this film for Best Comedy/Musical and Best Actor in A Comedy/Musical. If this film were to be ignored it would be a shame. I also look forward to other projects Sacha Baron Cohen will be involved with and this film if it hasn't already will definitely make him a star and he is one comedian who really deserves that honour.",8,1,6,11 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hulk
","The Incredible Hulk is a live action film version based upon the Marvel comic book's famous superhero who has become famous through both television and even a feature film from five years ago. I have seen small parts of the live action Hulk television series from the 70's, but only small parts and never an entire episode. Also growing up I did read some graphic novels, but I was never really into the many superhero comics that existed, so before going into this movie I only knew a little bit about the Hulk from what I have seen of the television shows and the trailers for the two films. I would guess that the more knowledge you have about the history of Bruce Banner and his alter ago the Hulk, the better off you are enjoying this movie. Unlike some of the other superhero films we have seen lately, this version does not really give us as much of a back story of the Hulk, or Bruce Banner. The film takes place after all this has happened and how Bruce became the Hulk, we learn in flashback scenes and just through conversations that the characters have with each other. Still, I did not find the film hard to follow because of this and it still made it easy enough to follow for someone like myself who was never really been into the comics, television shows, or other sources of media that the Hulk has been in. Reviewing a film like The Incredible Hulk, or even Iron Man, or some of the other action superhero movies lately, is not quite as fun, or always that easy to write about compared to an art film such as Mister Lonely, which was the last film I saw in theatres. I find it easier to write more about experimental, or artistic films, or even films with a lot of in depth characters or happenings going on. I personally like to analyze the films and characters in the movies that I 'am watching and I 'am not trying to sound biased, but usually in a film of this kind, you do not have a whole lot of character study, intelligent dialogue or thought provoking material that will stay with you long after the film is over. However, I can say that much like the other kind of films I have reviewed this summer (I'm talking more about the Hollywood releases that mostly have been about superheroes and have big budgets and so on) The Incredible Hulk is not anything groundbreaking or new and probably not even particularly needed since we just had a Hulk film a couple of years ago and we are getting bombarded with superhero films, but on the positive side this movie has an excellent pace and will have enough action and enough going on to please even the most particular film viewer. Like many of these type of films I see simply because my theatre doesn't usually get the artsy or intelligent films, I liked this film simply because of the entertainment factor and that is all I can really go by for my recommendation. And by recommending it, I'm given it a positive rating, but would much rather persuade people to see something like Mister Lonely if it is playing in your area, or even the vastly underrated film Sex And The City, which is a Hollywood film, but unlike the Hulk it is clever, has well developed characters and leaves you more to be satisfied with intellectually than two hours of mediocre special effects and action scenes that are really nothing new. If you are a big fan of Marvel comics and the Hulk then this film will be for you and for those who live in a city like mine where you are stuck with films like this, you could do worse than seeing this film because it is entertaining and even though it's strictly by the books it is entertainment and I guess that is what people want to see when they go to the theatre, so this may be right for you. As for me I liked it, but I don't think it will be something I'll see again, or remember even a couple of months from now when I have seen more and hopefully better films.",8,2,3,23 June 2008
The Monuments Men," The Monuments Men
","Overall, I am quite surprised at the weak ratings that The Monuments Men, is getting from both critics and audiences. I personally really liked it a lot. No, the film is not action packed with a lot of violence, or explosions, or things like that, and I for one was glad that it wasn't like that. The film wasn't action packed, but I did not find that it had a slow pace, or was boring whatsoever. Instead, I found the film which was based on real people and a true story and events to be respectful and thoughtful about these people, their mission and the subject in general. We get to know the characters a little bit and get to like them and the actors who play them all do a really good job here. The film also looks great and it's attention to detail for that time period is also very impressive. I found the film interesting on a number of different levels. The second world war aspect of the film was interesting enough, but I also found the story of these men who went in and tried to uncover these various pieces of stolen art masterpieces to be equally as interesting and that is more or less where the film places it's focus. I think because I love art and respect it, that the whole art recovery and search part of the film intrigued me and just seeing these masterpieces stolen and later being searched for was intriguing to me. I also liked how the film kept everything low key and did not overly elaborate, or embellish things making it feel more realistic and less like a major Hollywood film. If this had been filled with action, explosions and a lot of violence, I do not feel that it personally would have worked. Instead we have a much quieter and gentler film which is more sensitive to both the subject of the war and also has it's appreciation of art and these men deeply embedded in it's appreciation in this film. I personally cared for the characters in this film and the mission they were on and I really did want them to uncover and find all this stolen art. Whether they do or not, I will not give away for those who have not seen the film. Overall, I was very impressed with the film's look, tone and quiet and yet respectful treatment of the subject. Some may find it slower moving and may be a bit disappointed with it, but I found there more to take in and appreciate with the film being that way. I hope more people give The Monuments Men, a chance because I personally found it to be great and I know that there is an audience out there who will think the same as I did.",Null,1,3,24 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Captain Phillips
","Captain Phillips, which is based on a true story and of the book by Richard Phillips and Stephan Talty, has been getting a little bit of backlash from the media, because some events in the movie weren't accurate, or were embellished for the film and weren't as close to the truth as some may have wanted. I guess this does not bother me personally because I for one do not remember specifically the exact details of this story when it happened in 2009, nor have I read the book which serves as a guide to the film. So for those who want perfect accuracy and were looking for an one hundred percent accurate film, I can not comment on that. Some of my more regular readers on this site may be a bit surprised that I went to see and review a film like Captain Phillips, because for the most part I do not either see, or review action films because I often find them boring an clich√©d and full of long unnecessary effects and just things that to a lover of a good film script, or acting, more, or less leaves me dry. Captain Phillips, on the other hand is a horse of a different colour though. Yes, there is a lot of action in it and I guess it would technically be considered an action film, but this is what I would call an action film done right. The film captures your interest pretty much right from the beginning and at times it can be a very intense and harrowing film. The film even though it is a little over two hours, moves at a brisk pace and because of how involving the film is, we do not feel the running time and instead as a viewer we are so immersed into the events going on before our eyes that we really do not care how long the film is because we want to see what will happen to these characters and how everything will be sorted, or what the end consequences will be. The film is directed by Paul Greengrass, and to be honest, this is the first film I have seen by him as a director. I wanted to see United 93, when it came out, but unfortunately I have not seen it yet, but I do plan on it. I was very impressed with Mr. Greengrass's direction in the film and it really does add to the overall affect that it left me with. Other than Tom Hanks, who delivers a top notch excellent performance here, all the other actors were unknown to me and I don't believe I had ever seen any of them in anything else before, but I actually think that helped the film. By casting lesser known actors, or perhaps people who are acting for the first time, it gave the film a certain authentic quality to it and it felt more real and less like a Hollywood film. Speaking of a Hollywood film, even though this is a Hollywood production and is a wide release film, it didn't feel like a Hollywood film at all. I loved the choice of the unknown actors and also the fact that the film was shot in a cinema verite style making everything seem more gritty and enhancing the unpleasantness and the heat, fear and conditions the characters are in. The final shots of this film were so powerful and so unlike a mainstream Hollywood film that I could both really appreciate it and the final shots were haunting to me, but also powerful and something that will stay with me for quite awhile. The editing of this film is also top notch which includes jumping from scene to scene and event to event with skilled precise from the editors and I think it was also one of the film's strongest points. I also like how the pirates in this film were given personalities and were not just overly exaggerated cartoon like clich√©s of what a pirate, or evildoer must be. They interact with one another and we can somehow connect with them as much as we can even though we do not sympathize with them, but the film does humanize them in a sense and makes them seem like everyday people, just caught up in a terrible way of life and living. Again, I think the acting from everyone is really strong here. Tom Hanks' delivers one of his strongest performances in years as someone who is level headed under pressure and also at the same time brave, but also terrified and unsure all at the same time. The affect his performance and what this character goes through is all the more believable because of his strong performance. All the lesser known actors do a great job too and their performances seem real and are equally as powerful and affective. I like how these characters were able to interact and also that between the captain and the pirates, at times there almost seemed like they had a sense of honour and respect for one another. The way they communicated was one of the film's strong points as well. Captain Phillips is exhilarating and a powerful film to watch that because of how well done it is, it is bound to leave you feeling something after you leave and you will be totally immersed in the film as they do this. A first rate action film.",9,0,1,9 November 2013
3:10 to Yuma," 310 To Yuma
","3:10 To Yuma is a remake of a film of the same name made in 1957 and based upon a short story by Elmore Leonard. The film is set in the old west and is about a rancher named Dan Evans who agrees to escort a captured outlaw named Ben Wade to the next town to be taken on a train to the Yuma jail. Dan is a good man with honest intentions and good principles and he is also short on money and wants to support his family, so he agrees to go along with a group of other people to take Ben to the train station. Along the way they encounter difficulty with members of Ben's gang trying to prevent them from getting to the train station and getting Ben there proves to be a more difficult task then they had planned. I haven't seen a lot of westerns before, I mean I have seen some, but not enough to make me an expert of the genre, but if they are done well I do like them and I did like this remake of 3:10 To Yuma. Keep in mind I have never seen the original, so I can't compare the two films, so I' am rating this film purely on my unbiased viewing of it. Technically the film was very well made with good direction, editing, costumes and the film looked exactly like the old west and the attention to details with the costumes and sets were well done. Also this film was different from a lot of other westerns I have seen in the way that I found there was a lot more depth and personality in these characters and there was more to this film than simply action scenes and shootouts, which was another thing I admired about it. Granted when there was an action scene or shootout they were done with good editing and stunt men and it ended up being very entertaining. Probably my favourite part of the film was getting to know both Dan and Ben and what makes Dan a good man and why he is so devoted to his family and being a good citizen and why Ben is an outlaw and why everything he does leads to violence or something evil. At one point in the film the characters do talk to each other regarding something similar to this and in a way you almost get the feeling that Ben admires Dan and has some respect for him and perhaps wishes he wasn't so late in life as to not have a chance to change his whole life around. So in between the action I found some good comparisons between characters and because the acting by the two main leads were so impressive it was pulled off very well. For being a more intelligent and different western which I admired and because of being well made technically and good performances I recommend the remake of 3:10 To Yuma to fans of westerns and even to people like myself who haven't seen many, but might want to give them a try and here is a good place to start.",8,2,7,8 September 2007
War Dogs," War Dogs
","I was so hoping that War Dogs, would be a breakthrough film for writer/director Todd Phillips, much in the way that last year's The Big Short, was not only the most mature film of writer/director Adam McKay's career, but it was also what I would consider to be his best film and it even won him an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, amongst other nominations and honours that the film received. I say this because up till this point, both Phillips and McKay had been known mostly for lowbrow comedies that were obnoxious, crude and featured very juvenile humour and antics which would probably appeal to teenagers and maybe guys in their early 20's, but after that the appeal would greatly diminish within older and more mature viewers. I admit and I have my reviews on this site to prove that I have liked past works by both these directors, but again they were just amusing comedies that I would see once and then probably not bother with again and while humorous and entertaining at the time, they would have no lasting impact, or affect on me other than having a few chuckles amongst the other filmgoers at the theatre. McKay broke through this barrier last year with The Big Short, and now he has plans to do other more serious and yet entertaining films like one he has lined up with Jennifer Lawrence, and while I am sure he will still do his immature comedies, he has proved that he can and has the ability to do more serious and ultimately much better work. Having now seen War Dogs, I can safely say that not only has Phillips shown his truest talent as a writer, director and ultimately as a filmmaker, but I also think like McKay he has made the best film of his career. War Dogs much like The Big Short, focuses on real people and events that unfold before our eyes and the film is very satirical at times and also gives a good commentary on things such as how these two young men could have conned the American government the way they did and basically how easy it was for them to get filthy rich and do so under everyone's noses, or without them being aware. The film looks at war and weapons and how the American government goes about it's daily business with these types of foreign affairs and activities and the filmmakers here give a very critical and sometimes scathing look at such things showing that as voters, citizens and everyday people, we really sometimes have no clue as to what our government officials are up to, or what goes on behind the scenes and it also leaves one thinking that these people must not always be completely competent, or on top of things the way they should have been because otherwise we wouldn't have a film like War Dogs, or a true story and events such as this film depicts because anyone who knew what was going on would have put an end to it a long time ago, or so I hope. The film is just as good as any political spoof, or skewering by offering up many things for us as viewers to both be amazed and horrified at in equal measures. All the while though, Phillips proves he can tell a good story and both make an impact with it and completely engulf us into the world of arms dealings and the seedy goings on that these characters were involved in. The film can be quite humorous at times both in crude ways which Phillips still knows how to do, but yet he improves upon here and yet the film is so riveting that while not a thriller we are still so fascinated by what is going on in front of us that it would be a major mistake to leave the theatre even for a couple minutes and dare miss a second of this riveting story unfolding before us. The film's script is sharp with both it's quite perceptive and sometimes painfully accurate criticisms of what these two men did as well as the failure at the time of the American government, but it also raises good questions about what anyone would resort to and what depths, or lows we might go to in order to make a name for ourselves and be filthy rich even if it means facing major consequences. The acting here from the whole cast is also excellent and some of the finest work of both Jonah Hill and Miles Teller. Phillips has proved he can make one great film and I hope like McKay they continue to make serious and thought provoking films of a higher quality like this and not just go for the easy, or stupid laughs like in the past because in both cases that would be more or less selling themselves out and isn't that basically what they were both against with these two movies? I hope they will continue to work seriously, but as it stands, War Dogs is one of this year's finest achievements and overall best films.",10,4,12,20 August 2016
The Hangover," The Hangover
","The Hangover, is about a bachelor party in Las Vegas for a couple of friends that ends up going totally wrong, resulting in the friends trying to remember what exactly happened the night before and retrace their steps to eventually get back home again in time for the one character's wedding. More problems and off the wall hilarity follows. It seems recently that a film like The Hangover could really be a hit, or a miss. It is an R rated comedy that is very crude and sometimes very silly and something like that could go either way with critics. We have all seen how well the R rated films of Judd Apatow have been received as well as films like Borat and Wedding Crashers. All of those films for the most part I enjoyed a lot and I will add The Hangover to the list of R rated adult comedies that actually work really well. The comedic performances, which I always find so important to a comedy, are right on target here with a few exceptional performances from some of the supporting cast and overall they make the film work. The film's script is like I mentioned, pretty off the wall and it really is a wild and crazy movie, but it makes for a very entertaining, hilarious and at times exciting ride that you just get fascinated by watching. You do not perhaps want to be one of the characters in this film, but watching them and as things keep getting worse and worse for them in totally unpredictable and bizarre ways it is very captivating and will sure to keep you entertained. Even if this genre of comedy is not your particular taste, I would find it hard for someone to be bored by this film because it is so faced paced and wild that we feel the characters and us in the audience have just entered a non stop roller coaster ride that will make us laugh, feel a bit nauseated at times and will certainly keep us alert and wanting more of the crazy ride we are on. That, I feel is an appropriate way to describe this movie. And even though a lot of the film is silly and a bit on the far fetched side, a lot of it is very creative and just to make an almost two hour film work so well as this one does, you have to acknowledge the talent that went behind it. The performances work, the script works and the fast paced direction all work and make this film not just an above average comedy, but instead a very good comedy that is one of the best of the past few years. It is very funny, entertaining and like I mentioned it will capture your interest and take you on a wild jolted ride till the film ends. I personally really enjoyed myself when I saw this film and this is a perfect example of an adult comedy done right that is pure entertainment, but done well, so we are not only entertained, but get a lot of laughter and enjoyment from watching it. One of the best comedies of the year so far and for fans of the above mentioned films, this is highly recommended for you as well.",10,5,10,11 June 2009
Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette
","Marie Antoinette is a unique telling of the story of the legendary French ruler. In the film Marie an Austrian girl is set to marry King Louis XVI in France after it is arranged by the parents. Marie is only 14 when they get married and still as a young woman she has a lot to get used to living in the palace and dealing with scandal, politics and what other people are expecting of her. The film is told in Marie's perspective and deals with her many years being a ruler and her marriage and the problems that later became of her and France. Marie Antoinette has good direction, a good screenplay, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration, good costume design and good hair and makeup. This movie is one of the most gorgeous looking films I have ever seen. Everything from the sets, makeup, costumes and more all look great and very much like the 1800's. It is a visually stunning looking film. The film also has good performances, direction and a very original and unique script that approaches the story in a very interesting screen. Behind the scenes of this movie the film is virtually perfect with everything down to the last detail looking perfect on screen and playing out very well. The film's writer/director Sofia Coppola makes the film interesting by adding some humour to it, giving it a good pace and even putting in some modern day music set to some of the scenes as well as classical music and it all works very well. I could see how a lot of directors would try and make this movie and it would end up a dry and boring period piece, but this film is anything but that. I also liked how the story was told in Marie's perspective and the film showed her as being a normal human being and showing her just like anyone else. Because of her age I think the film did her justice by showing that she was a little immature at times and did some things purely because of her age and that she wasn't really mature or ready enough to be in this sort of situation. I liked how the film portrayed her and didn't try to make her look perfect and wasn't afraid to showcase her difficulties and true self during this movie. Because the film looks great, is entertaining, original in the style it brings the story and because it is a well paced and well made film in every way I really enjoyed this film. That being said some of the things I liked about this film will not appeal to everyone and I'm sure historians will find enough that isn't truly accurate of the real Marie Antoinette and that may ruin the film for them. Still, I enjoyed it a lot and I think people like myself who didn't know a lot about the real Marie Antoinette in the first place may find enough to like in this film and appreciate it as I did. It definitely won't appeal to everyone, but for a more artistic crowd this movie will probably play for them pretty well. I would also like to note that I wasn't really big on Sofia Coppola's first two films The Virgin Suicides and Lost In Translation not because they were bad films, but because they just did little for me. This film did a lot for me and I see a lot of greatness in Sofia's direction which makes me almost want to re-watch the previous two films and makes me eager to see what else she will put out in the next couple of years.",8,1,4,28 October 2006
Detroit," Detroit
","While sitting through the new film, Detroit about the Detroit riots from 50 years ago and also what happened afterwards at The Algiers Motel, which could be described in no other terms than extreme police corruption, intimidation as well as flat out abuse of power and racism, it left me pondering as I sat in my theatre seat about how exactly I would rate this new film in my review for it and what also I would say about it. The problem proves to be a perplexing one because as one who reviews films would know, you basically have to review a film on a number of different levels and looking at several sections of criteria and merits within the film to give the film a proper rating and overall review. If, I was to look at this new film as someone who is overall judging the technical achievements, or faults within it when it comes to things such as direction, writing, cinematography, acting and just overall how this new movie was made I have to say with great and precise determination and praise that it far excels in each and every one of these levels of craft and overall filmmaking. There really is no weak link here because everything on a technical as well as skilled level is just done so well here and everyone both in front of and behind the camera has achieved true greatness with this film and I think however you felt about the film after you came out of viewing it, I think few people could say that it was poorly made, or even the least bit amateurish because nothing could be farther from the truth. It is probably the most skilled and polished piece of work I have seen thus far this year as far as sheer craft, technical ability and overall filmmaking talent goes. So why am I hesitating and not just singing the film's praises repeatedly over and over? My main problem lies not so much with the film's subject matter, or what it is about, because even though I am sure that there was much fabricating and the writer and director took a certain amount of liberties when telling this true story and even within the end credits it admits that some, or maybe more than we think of what we saw was up to the writer and director involved because some things that would make the film more coherent, or just that much more effective as far as storytelling goes was added, or dare I say made up to make things a bit juicier, or probably the best word I can use here is 'shocking'. I realize that to make a film powerful and overall to have a great affect upon it's audiences you have to leave your viewers sometimes with strong emotions, or a sense that what they just saw was powerful, or moving, or whatever adjective best suits the film in question. This is a story that definitely needs to be told to shame both the police force and attitudes of the law enforcement in this particular situation, but also raise questions about one's own moral duties, or questioning inwardly about what we ourselves would do in these particular situations. To film a story like this, I realize that to capture it authentically you do need to show some violence and brutality up to a certain point as well as both scare and perhaps even provoke your audience into some kind of fear, or tension to really get the mood across about what you are displaying on screen. On the other hand, I felt that while this film needed to be forceful with it's approach that it crossed on my levels what is appropriate and after awhile the language as well as the violence seemed to not just border, but over engulf itself by being far too excessive with it's use of screen violence and language that at times it was not only a turn off, but also quite unsettling as well. I realize the filmmakers really wanted to pack a punch with this story and the overall product and they certainly achieved that, but perhaps going to this far an extent was not necessary in my opinion and I feel that in the meantime they are going to turn off many potential viewers of this film and may even cause more sensitive audience members to leave the theatre in disgust. I feel that to make a film effective you do not need to resort to these type of tactics to get a response from your audience and again here it feels excessive and almost like it was trying to attack and manipulate the audience. However as far as technical achievements go this far far surpassed all my expectations on that level, so I am giving it a perfect rating for that alone as well as the fact that this is a story that needs to be told even if it would have been just as effective, or preferable if they toned down the brutality a notch. Overall you be the judge, but be forewarned.",10,9,24,6 August 2017
A Star Is Born," Bradley Cooper's A Star is Born
","As it is plainly visible from the homepage on this site for the new film, A Star is Born, there are so many user and critic's reviews for this new movie, that I can safely say that I can't say anything that hasn't already been said, or written about it, but in my effort to try and review most of the new films I see at the theatre, I will certainly try my best to do a worthwhile review, even if the majority of the people who usually read these reviews have had enough reviews of this new film already. As, I think it is also pretty clear, this new version of this story is nothing new as it has been made already three times and I also have to be honest and admit that I have never to this day seen any of the other versions, so how closely this new film follows them, or if they have a certain sequence, or story arc between them I do not know, but from what I understand, writer/director Bradley Cooper borrows a little bit from all versions, but also certainly makes this film his own with his own unique stamp on it and also a very unique and worthwhile debut as a writer and director as well also in this case as a singer and songwriter as well. I think over the years having seen many films about showbusiness and the lives of either actors, singers, or people in the entertainment industry in general we as an audience have come to expect certain things from these movies. Usually they feature a celebrity of some kind who can not deal with the various pressures from being famous and this causes them often to go off the deep end with either alcohol, or some kind of substance abuse, or abuse of their bodies in some excessive way. I think it would be something new and even perhaps refreshing to have a story about a celebrity who avoids these pitfalls and basically can hold their own both while performing and keeping a handle on their personal life, but perhaps I am being the naive one here and the many deaths of musicians and people in the entertainment industry just goes to show that success and fame truly can be a hard act to juggle and maybe more credit, or understanding is due to those who in some ways we know very little about outside their public persona. The substance abuse issues are certainly on display in this new version as well and jealously, power hungry managers and agents and the various pressures that stem out of and because of this is all here. It is handled in an interesting if not altogether entertaining version and the performances can be very powerful here even if at times it does border a little bit on melodrama. I think a lot of questions people had about this film include how is Cooper as a writer/director/singer and how is Lady Gaga in her first starring role for the big screen? I can safely and assuredly tell you that Cooper directs and writes like he has been doing it for ages and he truly is a wizard behind the camera and his writing as well as singing is all well done also. For his performance I can also say that I think it is the strongest as well as the best performance of his career thus far and I think choosing to write and direct films and to only direct films he has written himself is a wonderful career move and gives hope to Hollywood as we have another true auteur in the making and a good one at that. Lady Gaga who I know has appeared on American Horror Story, which I have never delved into, but here for her big screen debut she is certainly very impressive not only with her singing and songwriting, but also a emotional performance and a moving one at that. I think it is pretty much guaranteed that both Cooper and Gaga will be up for acting Oscars as well also with Sam Elliott in a wonderful supporting performance. The songs where Cooper and Gaga accompany each other are well done and should also be up for nominations as well as writing, directing and even Best Picture. The film is certainly not my favourite film that I have seen this year, but that is not to say it isn't worth seeing because it certainly is and I was impressed at how many people at my theatre came out to see this film in it's second week and overhearing how much they loved it. For a mainstream outing it is as good as it can get in a time of remakes and cliches being done countless times, but I look forward to seeing more from Cooper and Gaga and what they have left us with is certainly impressive and worth the time out at the theatre.",9,9,18,14 October 2018
Gravity," Gravity
","Originally going into Gravity, if I have to be honest about it, I was not quite sure what to expect and my expectations were not all that high. Seeing the early trailers for the film made me a bit concerned that the film would either be incredibly boring and just another long line of excuses in using this 3D technology for effects and what not, or that the film would be kind of like the summer spectacle films released that have big star power boasting it as well as a lot of special effects and action scenes and quite frankly I was not interested in seeing a movie like what I just described. On the other hand there were tons of reviews by critics and users online calling it one of the best films of the year and some calling it one of the best science fiction films of all time. The great reviews did peak my interest a little bit and I finally gave in and went to see Gravity. My thoughts? Overall, pretty impressed. The film was not boring, or self indulgent with special effects as I had worried that it may be and also it was not action scene after action scene with endless and ridiculous special effects either. What, I got instead was a more quiet and subtle film, but nonetheless one that packs an emotional punch. To either compliment, or ridicule the special effects and visuals of the film, would not be right seeing as I opted out of seeing the film in 3D and instead just saw a regular projection booth version of the film. While some of the cinematography and visuals were impressive, I think they would have even been more so in 3D and that is where a lot of praise from critics and online reviewers are coming from, so seeing as I did not see it in that medium, I will stay out of that debate and just say that what I did see was impressive, but that with most films like that, that it was neither here, nor there for me and the effects neither added anything, nor took anything away from my viewing experience either. Gravity, is above all a film about survival. I will not go into any more details than that, so you can enjoy this spoiler free review and discover the film on your own if you decide to do so. The film has a shorter running time and while sometimes I like films to have a bit of a longer running time to add more character and depth to said films, I personally found that keeping Gravity, at the length that they did was not only a good decision, but one that suits the film perfectly as well. Everything you could want was put into the 90 minutes of this film. You had really good character study as well as interesting storytelling and an added emotional content that I felt really helped create mood and both empathy and fascination in watching the characters as well. There were times, especially in the beginning of the film, where it got quite tense and I could feel myself going with the film into those emotions and feeling the type of dread and fear that these two characters are feeling. It wasn't the most pleasant feeling in the world, but at the same time I appreciated that the film had an affect on me like that and that what I was watching was connecting to me and myself to it as well. Going through their whole ordeal during the course of this film, I got scared for these characters, cared for them and at times were rooting for them to make the right decisions to save themselves and get to safety. The empathetic and emotional content really added to the overall feeling of the film thanks to some top notch writing and direction as well as the very impressive lead performances of the film. If, I have to be perfectly honest about it, I would have to say that nothing I have seen Sandra Bullock in has ever really wowed, or moved me in any way. That being said, I have not seen a lot of her films because they have never interested me and same with the style of performances she often gives as well. Keep in mind that I never saw the role that gave her the Oscar for The Blind Side. Perhaps if I saw that, I may feel a little bit differently. I have to say however that she completely held her own in this role and gave a terrific performance that is sure to earn her an Oscar nomination next year as well as perhaps the Oscar itself. She shows so much vulnerability and strength in this role, but we can still see how fragile and scared she is inside during the course of the film and how she tries to triumph that is not only interesting to watch because of the writing and directing, but also for her strong performance as well. It completely changed my thoughts on her as an actress and I hope she is allowed and chooses more projects like this where she is allowed to show this great acting range that she has. The film has a slower pace at times, but there is so much both visually and with the characters that you try and take in, that it is never boring and you are always watching with absolute fascination and awe. I credit the filmmakers for not making an action packed film with explosions and special effects and instead giving us a real story that looks real and feels real too. We feel what these characters do and their ordeal through this film is often felt on us the viewers which is not always an easy task to accomplish.",10,1,2,21 October 2013
Wind River," Wind River
","Wind River, is a film that certainly packs an emotional wallop and punch to the gut and will be sure to linger with you quite awhile after you have seen it. This is accomplished not just simply because this is a film and filmmaker in total control of their craft and just filling the project with emotionally rich and well developed characters, a haunting yet beautiful musical score and also a sense of tension as well as dealing with the grief and the hurdles that these characters have to go through as well as incorporating a message that because of it's resonance and truth now more than ever is sure to connect with many people who look at the news on a daily basis and know just generally about the true subject matter of this film. By divulging this I am not giving any spoilers away for this film, but it is indeed based on true events about a murder and rape outside of a Native American community to a young Native American woman. The film takes place and I assumed that actual events also took place in Wyoming, but as a Canadian who has never been to Wyoming, I can certainly tell you that missing and murdered Aboriginal women is nothing new in Canada and has dominated and been a big part of the news over the years and sadly decades even. The last federal election we had here in Canada, this was an issue that was brought up by the opposition parties against then prime minister Stephen Harper, who with his Conservative party seemed a little chilly if not downright cold on the matter where there was little to no follow up, or investigations to these murders and missing girls across our country. While, I generally do not consider myself to be a member, or fan of the Liberal party which is currently in power under Justin Trudeau, I do hope however that they follow up with their initial persistence during rounds of parliamentary question periods and look into these deaths and murders with not only more resources, but also funding and the proper authorities to follow through with it. Are these a case of outright racism against these girls, or are there more underlying problems that may have to do with it? Here in Canada as well as depicted in the state of Wyoming, here in this film, it shows the true and yet sad state of how society in many ways has failed it's Native population. I am not sure how publicized it was at the time, but these days you can find much information about the residential schools that these young Natives were sent to several decades ago and how these schools affected them severely psychologically and perhaps in many other damaging ways as well. I know that within the Aboriginal communities alcohol and drug abuse can be a major problem and I say this because as depicted with some of the characters in this film, I think a lot of these individuals have not only been discriminated against within their own communities, but also by the governments who have sworn to protect them and this unfortunately has led to communities and areas that are supposed to be well funded and taken care of, but instead there has been cases of corrupt leaders who are stealing money away from their own people not to benefit others, but instead to lavish themselves with yearly bonuses and fancy living. The homes were these people are living are often run down and dilapidated and are in no means safe to call proper homes, or should even pass the health bill for safe living. I feel that these individuals often feel like there is no hope for them and often society has shunned against them which has caused them to turn to suicide and other means of abuse to one's self including high volumes of not only suicide, but also of alcohol, drug use and in many cases it is no wonder that these poor people can not survive on anything less than their monthly welfare checks. Hopefully soon the governments both here in Canada and over in America, will realize what a national problem will be and already is and I hope they will be swift to act and actually accomplish something to greatly benefit these people. The film also deals with the subject of grief and loss which is something that I think any audience member who sees this film can agree with. It shows that time may go by, but these wounds are internal and we may come around eventually to accepting certain things, but we will always have that deep loss and void that perhaps only true healing can fix. This is a powerful film fuelled by a passionate and yet moving screenplay and anchored by terrific performances and direction. This is certainly a film to see and also talk about after and perhaps get involved, maybe even within your own community because this is a problem that needs to be addressed and ignoring it any longer will just escalate things to an even greater tipping point.",9,1,5,9 September 2017
Star Trek," Star Trek
","First of all, I would like to start off by saying that many of the films I review for this site are not films that really have an everlasting effect on me, or for the most part would be films that I would watch again if they were on television, rent them at the video store, or public library, or buy them on video, or DVD. I live in a town with pretty much just one theatre that only caters to the people who like the big, loud and obnoxious Hollywood films that for the most part are a piece of garbage and a lot of the time I have no interest in seeing them. Often if a film gets good reviews I will go and see it to see what all the hype is about, but largely I have found that the critics nowadays have gotten a lot more conservative and tend to go for the non threatening and what I would call 'light entertainment' films, rather than something with more substance, or artistic importance. The films with artistic importance and that are thought provoking and sometimes controversial, or with non linear story lines is the type of films I prefer and seeing as my theatre does not get them, I have to order them, or buy them when I am in bigger cities that do carry such good films. I have reviewed some very good art, foreign and independent films which I was able to see in bigger cities and put the reviews here. Films like Mister Lonely, Saraband and Vicky Cristina Barcelona are an example. With that in mind I am getting really tired of all of this Hollywood trash and yet I go see it anyways because like I said the critics now seem to go for them more than the independent, foreign and art films which is a real shame. I guess what I am trying to say with all this is, when I review a mainstream and very Hollywood type film such as Star Trek, even if I give it a moderate to really good review, please remember that I mostly rate these films as Hollywood films and they do not even compare to a lot of the films I would see in a bigger city or a university theatre that would cater more to my taste. I rate these films as Hollywood films. If they get a 9, or a 10 that means they are pretty good for a Hollywood film and if they get less than 8, you should forget about them. With all that said, now on to Star Trek. This version of Star Trek is a prequel to the 1966 television series created by Gene Roddenberry. I would not call myself a very knowledgeable, or loyal fan to the Star Trek series. I have seen some of the original episodes from the 60's and I enjoyed them as well as the animated series that followed a few years later. I have seen documentaries such as Trekkies, or some television specials about the Star Trek fan universe and just how loyal some of those fans are. That being said, I don't know how many of those fans would like this remake of the original series because the original series was quite philosophical and dealt with moral issues as well as science and I think this was one of the big attractions to many viewers. There was some action in the original series, but I at least, found it more thought provoking for a series of that time and genre than most other science fiction shows, or movies and that is probably why I could get into it more than the Star Wars franchise. Not knowing all that much about the Star Trek world, or past characters and story lines, I mostly review this film as mostly a newcomer to all of this. The film did have quite a bit of action in it, but I didn't feel it dominated the film and neither did the special effects, which I appreciated. The characters were developed quite well and the chemistry between them was well written I thought and the few yet minor scientific, or philosophical points I did enjoy, but there is not as much here as in the series. I mostly felt that the film had a good pace, it was entertaining and well written and structured for a film of this kind. I was overall impressed and liked it quite a bit for a Hollywood mainstream release (note: Hollywood mainstream release). I thought it was better than most other sci-fi action films of recently and if there was a sequel this is one case where I would be tempted to see it. Take in mind that I have heard some die hard fans were displeased with the film, but seeing as I do not know everything they know about the series and the ones that followed, I am rating it as a newcomer and what I saw I liked quite a bit.",10,2,10,19 May 2009
Darkest Hour," Darkest Hour
","In reviewing Darkest Hour, I find it extremely difficult to write this review without making comparisons to this year's other film about Winston Churchill, simply titled, Churchill, starring Brian Cox in the leading role. The two different films have areas where sometimes they compliment each other and at other times it is as if they could not be any further distant, or opposite from one another. This same thing happened when back in 2005 you had Bennett Miller's film version of Capote come out telling the true story of writer and social figure, Truman Capote as he researches and writes his most famous book, In Cold Blood. The film was a smash with critics and was nominated for several Academy Awards including winning the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman the Best Actor Award for his uncanny and terrifically spot on portrayal of Capote. About a year, or possibly even less than that you had Infamous come out which starred Toby Jones as Truman Capote this time and yet still was about him conducting the interviews and even befriending one of the inmates on death role for the crime he committed which would later result in Capote's best selling book, In Cold Blood. I never saw the version with Toby Jones entitled, Infamous, but I remember one critic on television saying that of the two versions, Infamous was the one he preferred even though it got neither the awards, or media coverage that the earlier Seymour Hoffman film did. Is this always nescessary to have two films about a certain event, or person coming out in such short time apart from one another? And yet as I saw Churchill back in the Summer, and am now have seen Darkest Hour, in the days following Christmas, I have to make a distinction about which film is the better of the two and also which one I liked better in my opinion and I will go against popular opinion here and say that I actually preferred the Brian Cox film better for reasons which I will now elaborate on. The Brian Cox version of Churchill, I found to be not as technically polished, or shall I say that it did not come near as having the same financial backing, or behind the scenes talent that Darkest Hour did. You can tell right away that Churchill was more of an independent production whereas Darkest Hour probably cost a fair bit to make and of the two, Darkest Hour trumps it in terms of visual flare having what I consider to be some of the best cinematography, lighting and period piece attention to detail of any film I have seen this year. How the crew of Darkest Hour can set a tone and a mood just simply by it's lighting, or use of objects whether numerous, or few in a room was quite respectably and admirably done. The film was gorgeous to look at even though at times some of the scenes it was capturing were bleak, or the furthest thing you can think of away from the word 'gorgeous'. Also of the two performances, both were good, but Gary Oldman as Churchill in Darkest Hour, wins the prize here just as he most likely will on Oscar night as well. Everything from the miraculous make up and hair transformation of Gary Oldman into Churchill to his ravenous and empowered performance is the stuff that Oscar voters go for and truth be told it was an excellent performance. Brian Cox's performance used little to no makeup and yet while still a good performance on it's own merits, Gary Oldman's will be the one that is remembered. In terms of film structure and composition, Darkest Hour also overtakes the earlier film and you can tell that a much more experienced team worked behind it and they achieved what they set out to do and then some. So if Darkest Hour is visually a better film as well as technically structured better and has a better performance, why do I go with what is obviously the underdog between the two? I think more than anything it comes down to the fact that I overall found Churchill more of a pleasurable viewing experience and I was not only engrossed, but also fascinated by it's subject matter and for a fan of history as well as politics it was a satisfying night out at the movies. Darkest Hour on the other hand often to me felt very dry and at times it bordered on even being a bit slow, or dare I use the word 'boring'? It wasn't nearly as exciting, or as engrossing as the earlier film and I felt it also lacked emotion whereas it looked great, but there seemed lack of empathy at times and I do not think we got to know Churchill as well as we did in the earlier film where it often focused on his deteriorating health and on the rocks marriage as well. Darkest Hour feels more like a history lesson out of a really academic text book which is informative, but makes for a dull and dreary study session. Still both films have their merits, but of the two I have made my choice which I prefer and I am sticking by it. I am probably in the minority with my opinion kind of like that sole reviewer who preferred Infamous, to it's more awarded and decorated Capote, but in this case sometimes smaller is better and more effective.",7,0,3,1 January 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Inglourious Basterds
","For those seeking a realistic and accurate World War 2 film based on real facts and history and much in the style of classic films from the late 40's onwards, then you will be disappointed with Inglourious Basterds. For those who want something completely original and different from any war film you have probably ever seen and one of the most stylish and at times wonderfully weird, then this film is for you. For 2009, Inglorious Basterds is the first film of the year that comes close and pretty much succeeds as sheer perfection and a masterpiece of the ages. While, I choose not to give anything away about the story the film has a feel of films from the 60's and 70's (even though it does take place in the mid to late 1940's) and it borrows a lot from the Italian westerns of the 60's as well as some revenge and pulp/cult films of those eras. Some may feel that this may make the film a bit campy, or unrealistic. Yes and no. Some of the scenes and especially some of the violence is very over the top and for me at least it was so much that way that it didn't bother me as I have known it to bother some other people who saw it. The film is definitely not campy though. Weird, different, unusual and unique? Yes, but campy no. We have one of the year's best scripts and direction on display here with top notch dialogue and a stylish and very interesting style of direction that I really felt made the film the director's own without being a copycat of other war films. Yes, he is paying tribute to the 60's and 70's films I have mentioned with the style of it, but realistically, how many war films have you seen played out like that? The acting is also at it's best here with a very strong cast. There is not one weak performance out of all of them, but the absolute best goes to the scene stealing Christoph Waltz who plays Colonel Hans Landa. This is a character that can frighten, amuse and completely fascinate you and just the range Waltz has with this character is brilliant and I think is one of the first performances of the year that I definitely think will be up for an acting Oscar at next year's awards. Like I said everyone else did a great job as well. There are some fairly lengthy scenes in the film that just consist of character's talking, but the dialogue is so great here that instead of being boring it is fascinating and a complete joy to see these characters get into it, so to say, with their words. The film also has an artistic quality that often feels more like a European film and not that of a traditional Hollywood one and I really appreciated that. There are also some scenes in the movie that because of the acting, dialogue, music, script and direction are moments of sheer brilliance and there are a handful of scenes in this film that I will probably never forget because of how effective they were and how beautifully shot and delivered they came across. I will not give away any of these scenes, but those who have seen, or will see it will know what I am talking about. The film is also tremendously entertaining and what I wasn't expecting was actually how funny some of it was with some of the wise cracks of the characters, or just some of the more awkward, or over the top scenes in there. The audience I was with laughed a lot as well, so I must not have been the only one who found them funny. This film just oozes with brilliance and a unique touch sorely lacking in today's Hollywood films. This is a great piece of film-making on pretty much all levels. Again, I must add that you should read a little bit about the film in order to know what you are in for, because I can see a lot of people loving this film and admiring it as I have and I can also see people hating it. As for being controversial, it didn't offend me, but it wouldn't surprise me if some people were offended by it. A truly original and mesmerizing work that is so far the year's best film and one that will become a classic whether with a mainstream, or cult audience and will find greatness with such audience. One of the best films of the year.",10,2,10,23 August 2009
Coraline," Coraline
","Coraline is a stop motion and three dimensional animated film based upon the book of the same name by Neil Gaiman. The story focuses on a young girl named Coraline, who has just moved into a dark and dreary town with her two parents, who pay little to no attention to her at all. When Coraline goes to sleep she dreams of an alternate version of her new home and a much warmer and kindler family. Coraline wishes she could live in this dream world permanently, but as she soon discovers it really is not as it seems and there is actually a lot of danger lurking in this seemingly happy and carefree world, Coraline must eventually save herself and save the day and all of this is done in fantastic animation complete with 3D glasses the theatre gives you to view the movie in. There has been a lot of animated films as of late and for the most part they do not really appeal to me and for the most part I do not end up seeing them. I also do not care much for 3D animation all that much. I find it feels too computerized and I miss the days of hand drawn animation. Even the stop motion animation used in Coraline and the director's other film The Nightmare Before Christmas, I much prefer to 3D animation. It just looks a lot more interesting and I do not know if this is just coincidence, or not, but the stop motion films seem to have better stories and more originality than I find the 3D ones have. I also like the new computer type animation where the director films live scenes and paints over them with a computer program as seen in films like Waking Life. Back to Coraline now. The film with it's visuals, animation and the 3D glasses that accompanied the film made it a visual feast and it was a complete pleasure to look at and I really enjoyed that aspect of the film. Coraline's story was full of dark and more grim story telling, but I have always had a fascination with that kind of material, so it pleased me to no end. I also found the film to be fascinating, it moved along quite well and I wouldn't normally comment on something like this, but I found the voice actors for the film were really very well suited to the characters they were playing. Coraline is a film for anyone who likes the unknown, or mysteries, or for fans of 3D, or just animation in general I think it would be hard for anyone to not appreciate something of this film's top notch animation and the wonderful storytelling that went with it. This film has tons of excitement, great visuals and is all and all a very entertaining night out at the movies, which is often needed in the dark and grim months of the winter, much of like where Coraline lives. This film is highly recommended.",9,0,1,8 February 2009
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2
","Iron Man 2 is based upon the comic book series created by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. The film is also a sequel to the 2008 film Iron Man. Basically, I figure that if you are reading this review and you are interested in seeing Iron Man 2, then you are probably a fan of the original film two years ago, the comic book series, or perhaps both. For that reason I am not going into a lengthy synopsis of the plot because the fans know what they are in for and they are the ones who are going to go and see this movie. The 2008 Iron Man film, I found to just be okay. I think the thing I really liked about it was Robert Downey Jr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He was narcissistic and arrogant and the performance was pulled off perfectly. However there was little else for me to be impressed upon in the first film because I found most of the other performances to be lacking character and emotion, the story really did not do anything for me and the action and special effects sequences went on too long and became a big part of the story, whereas I prefer more background on the characters, the hero and the villains. It was an okay film, but not great. I wasn't sure how I would like Iron Man 2 after my disappointment with the first outing of what is sure to become a series, but I actually liked Iron Man 2 better than the first film, a lot better. First of all, I found the acting a lot better in this one from everybody and the newcomers were really good also. Secondly the film gave us more of a back story to the characters and villain and I found it got more personal this second time around. Instead of just non stop action and explosions there were more scenes letting us know these characters better and I found that to be far superior and more interesting than non stop excitement from the special effects department. I also found this version to have more humour in it and there are certainly some smiles and chuckles coming your way and it made the film a lot more fun and entertaining for me than the first one. I think fans of the first one will likely be a bit disappointed with this version and the reviews tend to reflect this because it is not as action packed as the first film and I have also read complaints that people had of the writer and director trying to put too much into one two hour film. There is quite a bit going on this time around, but I did not find that the film suffered because of it. Instead, I found it gave us more to look at and think about and was a pleasant alternative to the non stop action scenes I mentioned above. The writing I also liked a lot better because it gave us more time with the characters, had a more interesting story and because some of the one liners and humour that I mentioned were in the film earlier. These last few years it seems that most superhero films have been compared to 2008's The Dark Knight because of what a great film it was and I would have to agree. I don't think you will get too many that will get the genre right and give us as interesting a look at it as in The Dark Knight, but we may yet still be surprised. Iron Man 2 while I am giving it the same rating as The Dark Knight, is not as good as The Dark Knight, but as a film in this genre, I do think it is one of the better ones. The Dark Knight was more gruesome, dark and disturbing while Iron Man 2 is definitely lighter and more kid friendly than The Dark Knight and is not as much into the development or psyches of the characters. Iron Man 2 knows this and more, or less just wants you to have a good time watching it and leave feeling entertained. For those goals Iron Man 2 succeeded and then some.",10,5,8,17 May 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Forgetting Sarah Marshall
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall is about a man named Peter whose actress girlfriend, Sarah ends up dumping him for another guy. Because they were together for five years and because of Peter's love for Sarah, he is crushed by this news. He starts off by moping about his house and soon his job which leads to his stepbrother suggesting he take a vacation to clear his mind and forget about Sarah. Peter gives in and soon he is in Hawaii for a mini vacation. To make things awkward though, Peter runs into Sarah, who is also vacationing in Hawaii with her new boyfriend which makes Peter even more depressed until he strikes up a relationship with the clerk at the hotel he is staying at named Rachel. Running into each other frequently, Peter tries to forget about Sarah and start things with Rachel, but things may prove to be a tad more difficult as he has a hard time adjusting to the break up and Sarah's new boyfriend. I really wanted to like Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and while I didn't hate it, it didn't particularly wow me either. I found little to no humour in the film and when it tried to be funny, I found the jokes to be stale and some of the same material got repeated several times which just got to be tiresome and boring after awhile. I also really couldn't identify, or like any of these characters because most of them got on my nerves with their constant whining and self loathing. I also found the characters to be really into themselves and self indulgent which made it even harder to like them and identify with them and find pleasure in watching them. I guess there were a few moments where the creativity peaked, but mostly the film didn't feel particularly new, or anything worth raving about. The performances while not bad, couldn't really save the film either from just being a mediocre film that could have been a lot better. When you have a comedy that isn't particularly funny, inventive, or when the characters grate on your nerves, you know it isn't going to be a hit movie and Forgetting Sarah Marshall was certainly no hit in my books.",7,3,11,3 May 2008
Argo," Argo
","Argo is being hailed as one of the best films of the year and has a very good chance of being nominated for many Academy Awards next year and maybe even winning Best Picture. When the film had ended in the theatre in which I saw it, most of the audience applauded, but I did not and to be completely honest, I do not get all the hype and praise that this film is getting. Yes, technically it is a well made film, but to say anything else other than that and then I would be lying. Critics have called it riveting from start to finish, but I actually found the film dragged quite a bit and to me was quite dull. I also didn't think the mix of the scenes of the characters in Hollywood and then jumping to the hostages in Iran worked. It did not work because in these Hollywood scenes they are mostly played for laughs and supposed to be humorous with Alan Arkin's character and his foul mouth and John Goodman's character who is kind of oblivious to the Hollywood scene. This all was supposed to be funny and whether I laughed, or not was not the issue, but I found having a good part of the film being like that and then going over and trying to be all serious and tense with the hostage situation in Iran did not feel suitable. I didn't find the film could find the right balance between the humour in the Hollywood scenes and the more melodramatic and political scenes taking place in Iran. It all felt quite out of place and I didn't feel it complimented, or followed up each scene well because of it. It just felt awkward and like poor screen writing. Another problem I had was that I found a lot of the characters, especially the hostages to be quite smug and arrogant. I really have no idea whether this was intentional on the film's behalf, or not, but I found that they got on my nerves after awhile and because of that I could not relate, or feel any empathy, or compassion towards them which is a big flaw for a film like this because I think the film wanted you to be very concerned about these hostages and by giving them more personality and allowing us to care for them, I think the tension and our relationship and attitudes about them would be a lot different and I think if they had done that, the film would have impacted me more. I know it was my own choice to go see Argo, and pay the almost ten dollars I spent to see it, but I have to admit that these type of stories are just getting tiresome to me. Almost everyday on the news I see terror in the world and different regions against each other and a lot of hatred and violence going around. I watch it on the news to see what is happening in the world and to keep up on current events, but at the same time it does get to me from time to time and sometimes I am flat out tired of seeing all this negativity and hatred towards one another. Because of that, Argo felt to me like a news story I had seen one too many times this, or any other week recently and I just was not in the mood to see a two hour movie about it. That may have been my fault walking into a movie like this, but I have to be honest and say my opinions about it. There were also parts of the film that felt overly glamorous to appeal to a wide audience and a lot of it seemed to be made in such a way that it would cater to people and especially Oscar voters. Oscar voters love films like this and going by the way the audience I was with reacted, they did too. However to me it just felt forced and like it was trying to glamorize everything a little too much for those miniature bald statues. I do commend Ben Affleck for trying to make a serious film and I think he has come a long way in his career and he showed great promise with his last directorial effort The Town, but Argo simply did not work for me.",6,2,6,18 October 2012
Hostel," Hostel
","Hostel is about three young men who are backpacking through Europe. Their names are Paxton, Josh and Oli. Once they get to a Slovakian city things start to get weird and the friends begin to see less and less of each other. Eventually they discover a torture chamber where people come to watch others getting tortured for amusement. Soon the three backpackers might end up as victims of this chamber and of the unusual people around the city. Hostel has good direction, a good script, and good performances by the cast, good film editing and good cinematography. The film is a real adrenaline rush. It has a lot of energy and action, especially in it's second half. In the film's first film there is some good humour as we get to know the three characters and as things go along and people start to disappear the film really kept my interest and I was really curious to find out what would happen next. This is a well crafted horror movie with a pretty original script and some good atmosphere and style. It is very entertaining and full of action. It also has scenes that will make you squirm and get a little uncomfortable as well. All in all Hostel is a stylish film that is an entertaining and action packed film that also has some good horror in it as well. Hostel is the second film from writer/director Eli Roth who brought us 2003's Cabin Fever, a film that I also enjoyed. Roth does a good job here again and if he continues to stick to his own original scripts and his own direction, then I think that he may become one of today's better horror directors because he did a good job with the well crafted and smart Hostel.",8,1,4,7 January 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe
","The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The With And The Wardrobe is based on the novel of the same name by C.S. Lewis. The film takes place in England during World War 2 and is about four siblings. There names are Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. To keep them safe from the war they are sent away to live with a professor. One day while playing in the big house Lucy discovers that if you enter the wardrobe you will enter a winter land called Narnia. Her siblings do not believe her, but finally they look for themselves and see that Lucy was not lying. The siblings make friends with the local creatures who tell them that the land is cursed by the evil witch Jadis who has cursed the land to always be winter time. The animals protect the siblings from Jadis and they are introduced to a lion named Aslan who shows them that they are the only ones who will be able to save Narnia from the evil queen. The end results in a battle between good and evil and the fate of Narnia rests on their shoulders. The film has good direction, good performances by the entire cast, good cinematography, good art direction and good set decoration. The film started out really promising and I thought I would quite like it, but by the end I was quite disappointed. I thought the film was well made and it is a good looking film, but mainly I had trouble with the film's pacing. As I mentioned before, when the film started out I found it quite interesting, but as it went along I felt it dragged and soon it became slower and slower to the point where I was getting bored with the film. I feel that if perhaps the film had been trimmed and edited a little better that this may not be the case. I felt the end (especially the battle scenes) just went on for far too long and I just lost my interest. The book that this film is based on is quite popular and I'm sure that many people will really enjoy this film. I say this because I' am personally very picky when it comes to adventure/fantasy films. Really popular films such as The Lord Of The Rings just do not interest me and I think that this is a film that falls in the same category. I 'am sure that many adventure and fantasy film fans will enjoy this movie and me not really being a fan of the genre will stick with my opinion that I did not like it. However I do feel that I could have liked this movie with a little better pacing and editing. But as it stands I can appreciate the direction and the way the film looks, but other than that this film was just not for me.",6,0,1,10 December 2005
Public Enemies," Public Enemies
","Public Enemies is based on actual events in the 1930's during the Great Depression dealing with notorious bank robber John Dillinger and his gang of men. The film shows John robbing many different banks and hiding out from the police and Federal Bureau of Investigation, who have named him 'public enemy' number one. The film also focuses on the man who is determined to bring John down and to have him captured once and for all. A side plot involving a romance between Dillinger and a woman named Billie, is also featured. Films like Public Enemies can go either way for me. Sometimes they are high on substance and little on a good story and more on action and style, which I do not really care for, or there are also those which are very well structured and put together and leave the viewer entertained, thrilled and marvelling at the achievement. Public Enemies for me, fell into the second category. Yes, it does have a lot of style and was made with what looks like a big budget and popular Hollywood actors like Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, but the film does have a very involving story and even though it is quite stylish and was made for quite a bit, it never goes overboard with being unrealistic, or trying to show off with a lot of special effects, or technical tricks. There is one action scene that does go on for several minutes, but I found it to be very well paced as well as quite suspenseful and thrilling, so the fact that it was a longer scene did not bother me at all. I also found that the script had enough to keep us as the viewers interested and intrigued for the entire length of the film. I also liked some of the twists and turns that the film took and revealing some of the true intentions and real motives, of these characters. The only thing I would have changed with the film was to have more of Marion Cotillard's character Billie, because I found her to be quite interesting and it was a great performance, and yet I did not feel we got to know her as well as we could of and I would have liked to have known more about her and because the performance was so good, every time she was on screen it was a real pleasure to watch. Some scenes especially near the end with her in it are quite powerful and show the range of her great acting. Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are great also, but again we do not see as much of Christian Bale's police character as we do Depp as Dillinger. Mainly the film is about Dillinger, and having being advertised that way, it was no real surprise to me that the film mainly focused on him, but I would have liked a little more of the supporting characters as well because when they were on screen, I found them to be interesting and added more to the story than if it had just been about Dillinger robbing banks the whole time. The script really does develop the characters well and as I mentioned there are some powerful moments as well as thrilling moments to capture anyone's attention. The film looks good with it's cinematography (which is digital and has brought forward some complaints) to the great looking replica costumes of the era. Public Enemies has style and a great deal of substance to really fulfill any real movie lover's expectations and I felt mine were met and I really enjoyed what I saw. One of the best films of the year.",10,3,7,5 July 2009
Coffee and Cigarettes," Coffee And Cigarettes
","Coffee And Cigarettes, is a film with several different segments of people talking which has been filmed over a period of 17 years. Some of the segments include two twins in a cafe while a waiter thinks that one of them is a good twin and one of them is bad, two older men while one tells the other the dangers of smoking, a woman who will not be left alone by her waiter and my favourite of all is when actor Alfred Molina meets up with actor Steve Coogan for drinks and Alfred tells them that they are related. Coffee And Cigarettes, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everybody involved, good black and white cinematography, good film editing and good production design. Writer and director Jim Jarmusch, really shows us his talent for writing very unique characters and giving them great dialogue and things to talk about in this movie. Also a lot of the actors play themselves in the movie and make pop culture references to one another and it is always sharp and right on the dot. Coffee And Cigarettes, is smart, charming, humorous, offbeat and very unique and unusual, engaging, entertaining, thought provoking and is very well crafted and put together and finely acted and made. Coffee And Cigarettes, will certainly not be for everyone because the film is all talking and some may not understand the characters or their conversations and some skits are better than others but I did quite like this film. It shows it's characters for who they are. Sometimes they are funny, sometimes they are weird but always they are simply human and the film shows that. A smart and compelling talking movie that you might even want to discuss later with your own friends over a cup of coffee.",7,1,2,19 February 2005
Oldboy," Oldboy
","Oldboy, is a Korean film although it is dubbed into English. The film is about a man named Oh Dae-Su, who is kidnapped and locked in a private prison for fifteen years. When he is finally set free he is given five days to find out who did this to him and he plans on finding out and getting revenge for his imprisonment and death of his wife. Oldboy, has good performances from everybody in the cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good art direction. The film starts off with a very interesting premise and the visual look of the film is great but the story seems to go downhill as the movie moves along. One of the big problems I had with this movie is that I had a really hard time understanding it and I found it very confusing and muddled. When the movie finally got near it's ending time I found the film too long and it got boring and I felt like it could have ended a lot sooner. Also in some ways the movie was kind of pointless to me and it really left no impact. I thought I would like this film quite a bit because of very good reviews it has received and some recommendations I have gotten for the film but other than it's visual style the movie did nothing for me. An American remake is currently underway for this film and usually I'm opposed to remakes but maybe if I saw this film from a different point of view I might like it or respect it more.

Superbad," Superbad
","Superbad is a new comedy about teenage best friends Seth and Evan who will be graduating high school in a couple days and later going their own separate ways seeing as they both got accepted to different schools. Seth and Evan are very awkward and shy with other students and in particular the girls. After hearing about a party on the last day of school they make a plan along with another friend named Fogell to buy alcohol with a fake ID and bring it to the party and to later hopefully end up with one of the girls they each fantasize about. On the way to the party things go terribly wrong and Seth and Evan end up having one of the most wild nights of their life and an end of a school year that they will never forget. Superbad is about teenagers and the way the film is marketed it will clearly draw in the teenage crowd even though this film is not suitable for anyone under 17 because of the graphic sexual language and situations featured in this movie. The film was written by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg who apparently wrote the film as teenagers themselves and now years later their script has been made into a movie. Superbad really worked for me for many reasons. First of all I found it very honest and accurate and depicting teenagers and their way of talking and behaving during the high school years. It was so precise in it's attempt to do this that in ways it reminded me of my school days and some of the people I knew and grew up. And as for anyone who doesn't think this is how teenagers talk or act, then they certainly didn't go to a public or high school like I did where this behaviour is so common that it's almost a clich√©. I also liked how the film covered the awkward parts of school and social situations as well as dealing with the opposite sex. The way Seth and Evan were so close to each other and avoided all other people to be with each other is probably also more typical of teenagers than most people would realize as well. Some younger people watching the film might wonder if Seth and Evan are homosexuals, but they are not and the film just shows how close they are and as a result of being so socially awkward they have alienated themselves from other people and just focused on their friendship alone which I mentioned above is not all that uncommon. The acting and strong writing also made the movie great because it all played out like a classic comedy that one would (even though they probably shouldn't be) watching as a teenager and like many of the classic teen comedies from especially the '80s such as the John Hughes films or even Fast Times At Ridgemont High, Porky's or from the 90's Dazed And Confused. This film will instantly become a cult hit and a favourite for years to come because of it's great comedic performances, writing and downright hilarious situations these characters are put in. The dialogue while very crude and raunchy is also very well written and believable as well. Not to mention the fact that many films about teenagers cast people who don't even look like teenagers (usually because they are a lot older) and this film has perfect casting. Superbad made me laugh, kept me entertained throughout and reminded me of some of the pleasant yet awkward times of my own years at school. This film along with Hairspray and Knocked Up (featuring some of the same personnel as this film) is one of the most entertaining and fun times I've had so far this year at the movies. And it is one of the best films of the year and destined to become a cult classic and rightly so.",10,1,7,25 August 2007
Creed," Creed
","When I first saw the trailer for Creed, back in the Summer, I thought to myself that it was a very impressive trailer and judging by the trailer alone, that the film itself could be fantastic if they did the film right, which judging by the trailers, it looks like they did. This is one case where you had an excellent trailer to a film and the film completely lived up to it's expectations in each and every way. I wouldn't personally consider myself a fan, or very knowledgeable about the Rocky Balboa films. The only film in the series I have seen (up till now) was the original Rocky, which came out in 1976 and won the Oscar for Best Picture for that year. I really enjoyed that film a lot, but I never did seek out any of the sequels until this recent release of Creed. I think one of the reasons I did choose to see Creed, was because it did follow the Rocky films in a sense, but in another way it completely became it's own movie as well. I will explain more as we move along in this review. The film has a gritty and urban setting which the original Rocky did as well and I found it worked well in the original film as does it here as well. It further helps to show the background and environments that the characters come from and what they live and experience on a day to day basis. These are characters who were not handed everything in life, but had to go through difficult times and situations and built themselves out of their environments and the setbacks that they had to deal with to make names for themselves and not only providing themselves with a means of living, but functioning and surviving in a world that proves to be tough even after you have made it. I don't want to give too much away about the characters as not to spoil anything about the film, but I found that giving the film a new perspective and a new hero to follow was a much needed and welcome plot device. Rocky, played here again by Sylvester Stallone, is still here, but this time he takes more of a supporting role and we really get to see Michael B. Jordan, shine here as our new boxer and hero who we root for during the film. Rocky, is still very much an important part to this story and again without giving anything away, we root for Rocky during this film too. Here he plays an older and wiser type of figure who trains and guides along Jordan's character. Stallone here gives what I think personally is the performance of his career. He really downplays the character and plays him very straightforward yet relaxed and the performance feels and plays out so naturally, but there is also a lot of heart, wisdom and backstory to the character that he is fascinating to watch (as is Jordan's character) and yet we love him and respect him for who he is and everything he has accomplished as well. I hope Stallone is nominated for an Oscar for his role here and I would be a very happy man if he even won the award for the performance. It's that subtle yet excellent at the same time. The film's cinematography at times gives it a raw and almost documentary like quality which suits the film well because of the areas of town and the different backgrounds to the characters and the whole urban backdrop to the story which works so well here. This is a film with excellent character study and acting from the entire cast, but it also works well as a sports movie and has intense boxing scenes and yet you are completely drawn into them and rooting for our hero all the same. People say that Mad Max: Fury Road was the comeback series of the year, but I would argue wholeheartedly that Creed, not only reinvents the Rocky films, but it makes one great stand alone film as itself as well. This is the type of film where you root for the characters and end up cheering for them all in the end. Creed has heart, action, entertainment and is one of the most crowd pleasing movies of the year, but also one of the most brilliantly done and I would put it in my top list of best films of the year. A real breakout achievement as a film for Rocky fans and everyone else too.",10,2,5,28 November 2015
Constantine," Constantine
","Constantine, is based on the comic book Hellblazer by Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis. The film is about a man named John Constantine, who has been to Hell and back and can see demons running along the streets in the city. After his visions start to get to him John tries to commit suicide and dies for a few minutes but is reborn again. Finding out that it is a sin John, tries to rid the world of demons so he can earn his way into Heaven, because the doctors tell him that he will be dying soon due to his chain smoking. Meanwhile a detective named Angela Dodson, is investigating the strange death of her twin sister and goes to see John, because she thinks the death may have to do with the occult. Soon, John shows her his world of angels and demons and soon they have to fight humanity from evil. Constantine, has some need visual effects but that is about it. One of the big problems with this movie is that it is trying to cram so many plot ideas and situations into one movie and it just does not work and after awhile becomes muddled and confusing. The film is only two hours but it feels like forever. The film really started to drain me and for the last hour or so I kept yawning because of how bored I was and I just didn't care what was going to happen in this movie. Also near the end the film got so silly that it became laughably bad with some of the situations and dialogue. I've never read the comic book that Constantine, was based on but in my opinion it should have stayed a comic book and not a movie because we got some really good talent here that has been wasted.",4,0,4,2 March 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Brokeback Mountain
","Brokeback Mountain is based on a short story by Annie Proulx. The film is set in the early 60's in Wyoming where two young men meet during the summer where they are to ranch sheep on a mountain side. One is a ranch hand named Ennis and the other is named Jack who was a rodeo rider. During their time spent together the two men start to bond and fall in love with each other. After that summer they continue to go back to the mountain side to see each other, but this is hurting both their marriages to their wives and their children. Will they continue their relationship or will they have to cut it out before their families start to find out more about it?

Brokeback Mountain has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The film is a beautiful looking movie and is very well made. I enjoyed the film's story and thought that there was a lot of good character study and development in this movie. I thought the actors each did a good job of demonstrating their character's true selves as well. The movie is very touching and has a lot of tenderness and emotion. The film is believable and I think an accurate portrayal of the way things would be in this situation. Also I would like to add that I was deeply involved in this film and I cared about these characters and wanted to see what happened to them. Even with a running time of over two hours I never found the film to be boring or slow at all. I thought the film did a good job of showing these characters for who they are including their strengths and weaknesses. This is a touching, beautiful and sometimes sad and poetic movie. This is a very well done film and it should do well when it comes to the Academy Awards. One of 2005's better films as well.",9,5,6,14 January 2006
About Time," About Time
","The problem with About Time, is that it is not particularly a bad film, but at the same time it is not really a good one either. The film is purely and simply mediocre. The premise of the film sounded interesting enough with it's blend of romance/comedy and even a little bit of science fiction (if you really want to call it that), but I just felt that the film went nowhere with this material. In the right hands a story idea like this could have really been something wonderful if it was in the hands of say, Charlie Kaufman, or someone like that, but here the material loses steam and interest fast and I didn't feel the film used this interesting premise in any interesting ways. Events happen in the film where there is some sort of mishap, or embarrassment and so henceforth we go to the science fiction aspect of the film and changing the outcomes of many situations, but the problem is that the film used this plot device and gimmick too many times and it just never went anywhere and after awhile it never really seemed fresh, or original, but instead a film that has just one too many clich√©s and plot holes and it really did not feel like anything new, or breakthrough, but instead just a rehash of films that I have seen so many times before. I appreciated that writer/director Richard Curtis, tried to make us connect with these characters on the screen and giving us moments of which to laugh and cry, but again none of it really registered, or connected with me personally. I might have had a few laughs during the course of the film and at times it did hold my interest, but I just overall was not all that interested in how this film would end, or what would happen to these characters and the plot device/gimmick that was introduced into the story. At times the film almost felt a little emotionless as well. Things just seemed to drag on and it was never really all that interesting and at times, I do admit some of the emotion, or things going on, did feel a bit forced and the true emotional build up, or allowing us to care, or connect with these characters was never there. I have seen other Richard Curtis films before which I have liked, which was one of the reasons I chose to see About Time, but this I feel is one of his most underdeveloped films from a writing perspective because of how we never can connect to any one person, or event and just that none of it is all that interesting. I was hoping that like Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry's wonderful Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which did have a unique and original plot device and gimmick, but that film made us care and relate to the characters and situations more so than most films I have seen and was a film that always was fascinating and kept your interest and because of how personal and realistic it got, you could both identify with it and laugh and cry with it at the same time. The plot device there was not underused, but used in the right way and it ended up being one of the best films of the 2000's and one of the best films around period. I was hoping that writer/director Richard Curtis would have taken the same route with About Time, but unfortunately the end result was too flat. This isn't also to say that I hated About Time, because I didn't. There were times where I appreciated some of the humour in it and when the emotional content did not feel too forced, I felt that I did connect with it in some ways, but unfortunately those moments were too few and far between. I didn't like the film and I didn't hate it. I think that it is going to be one of those films which I will probably remember for a couple days and then as time goes by, I will forget most of what I saw on screen because it did not resonate, or connect with me as I wished it would have. I still like Richard Curtis and I would recommend viewers a lot of his other films whether written, or directed by him, like Love Actually, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary, or my personal favourite, the made for television movie The Girl in the Caf√©. All worth checking out. I wish he would have repeated some of the successful material in those films for About Time, but as it stands About Time, is neither good, or bad, but simply mediocre and nothing more.",7,5,9,18 November 2013
Spotlight," Spotlight
","Tom McCarthy's new film Spotlight is sure to be one of the most talked about and perhaps even one of the most controversial films of this year. The true story of a group of newspaper writers and their editors who decided to expose the vast number of cases involving sexual abuse within the Catholic church. This is a film that is extremely powerful to watch and while you are watching the film it affects you deeply because of the sensitive subject matter that it is dealing with and also because what these writers are uncovering is extremely disturbing and sure to leave you feeling uneasy and even perhaps a bit nauseated while watching the film. The fact that all of this is based upon true events that did not just occur over a short period of time, but spanning decades and perhaps even longer than that and the fact is that unfortunately the types of abuse documented and reported upon in the film are still happening to this day. The film takes place in Boston, Massachusetts and while a lot of priests and members of the Catholic church were uncovered there, it unfortunately doesn't just stop there, but spans all across the United States as well as pretty much all corners of the world. To my knowledge with the release of this film, I have not heard, or read about any backlash, or negative comments from the Catholic church regarding the matter, but on the other hand, if the film is factual which it certainly says it is, perhaps the church does want to remain silent on this issue especially because as I stated above it covers over the decades and is still a continuing problem. When, I make these remarks I must add that I am not an atheist, or have a personal vendetta against the Catholic church, or Catholics in general. While, I do not go to a Catholic church, I do and have watched a Catholic television series for years now and have really enjoyed the sound teaching of the program and in many ways it has been a blessing to me. Also, I do not think that the intent of the filmmakers here was to stir up trouble, or slam religion, or religious institutions in general. I think the main purpose of this film was to show everything that was being covered up for all these years and is still covered up to this day and the fact that these people claim to be worshipping God and obeying His word, but in fact living deceitful lives that go against the true teachings of the Bible and everything that their faith stands for. The film is not condemning religion at all, but instead the people who use religion as a means to pervert their own lies and injustices and claim that it is all okay because they hide under the cloak of the church and so for them it must be okay when really it is not. This is a fascinating film to watch and just like any good news story, or world event that is unfolding before your eyes the film is in equal parts fascinating, entertaining and yet as I mention above that because it is dealing with sensitive issues and based on fact that it is also extremely affecting and will certainly leave an impression on you after you leave the theatre and perhaps for longer than that. Everything is done right with this film from it's excellent screenplay which incorporates real facts, events and people and glues us to the screen in a film that is more captivating and in a sense more thrilling than any other action films of this year, or perhaps many others. The entire cast here is all top notch as determined people who are bound and determined to get to the truth of this story. They are not just doing this as to make names for themselves, or to bring themselves a lot of money, but instead because the subject matter is also personal for them and the people that they interview and meet, so in a sense they are out to right an incredible wrong and will stop at nothing to uncover this. The characters each respond to the matter in their own ways which also leaves a very interesting and percept view of the whole subject and runs the gamut of how each individual would, or maybe would not feel in this type of case, or situation. The character development and the portrayals by the actors is excellent. This is one of the strongest casts I have seen in awhile. This is a film for people who stand for truth and love deeply moving and affecting films and this is certainly a film that will leave it's mark on the audience and perhaps society as well which is all because of the power and talent that went into making it. One of the year's best.",10,2,3,8 December 2015
500 Days of Summer," 500 Days Of Summer
","500 Days Of Summer is a new comedy drama that examines and probes deep into your normal average romantic films and gives us it's own look at relationships and why they do sometimes work and why sometimes they don't. Just briefly it is about a young man named Tom, who falls for his new co-worker Summer and while they begin to bond and become good friends, he wants a much more committed relationship, whereas she wants it to be casual and sometimes seems to be giving Tom the brush off, so to speak. With the help of his friends and little sister, Tom tries to put all the pieces together to win Summer over, but along the way he does discover a lot more about himself, her and how tricky relationships can be. 500 Days Of Summer is not your typical film about love and I am hoping that that fact will not put too many viewers off. If you were hoping to see a predictably happy and schmaltzy head over heels in love film, then you should probably check for a different film to see, or if you are a little more experimental than give this one a try. By the end of the film it reminded me a lot of some of my favourite Woody Allen relationship comedy dramas of the 70's like Annie Hall and Manhattan. They both offer up some of the most witty, human and realistic looks at love and relationships I have ever seen and both sets of films do so in a quirky and sometimes offbeat kind of way and also blends comedy into the mix to make things interesting. Even the character personalities of Tom and Summer reminded me of a lot of the male and female leads in those Woody Allen pictures as well. A lot of the times because of how real and believable they seemed and because they were actually smart and well spoken characters who knew what they were talking about and what they wanted. They can get a bit high strung and over analyze things at times, but I also enjoyed that perspective of the film as well because honestly speaking, which of us does not do that at all in any sort of a difficult situation? I also really liked Tom and Summer because while watching the film I felt like I got to know them better and it were like watching everyday average people and even with their quirks and sometimes stubbornness that at times drove them throughout the film, I still really liked these characters, flaws and all. Not to mention that Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel who play these characters do a fantastic job. I also must mention the low key yet interesting direction of the film's director and the brilliant dialogue and look at human nature and relationships that felt like the most honest film about said subject I have seen in awhile. All this may sound like a heavier and more depressing film, but it is anything but. At times it was very cheerful and always left the door for the characters open to new possibilities and outcomes. Some of the humour in the film works quite well also, so it is not a depressing experience at all. I think if anything the film will offer couples who go to see it a lot to talk about. Not necessarily concerning ruining their relationships, but perhaps in some ways to make it better and discuss things about it that they normally might not have. For it's depth, insight and charm 500 Days Of Summer is a definite winner and one of the best films of the year.",10,4,8,29 August 2009
Juno," Juno
","Juno is about an eccentric 16 year old girl named Juno MacGuff who soon discovers that she is pregnant. Being 16 and pregnant isn't that easy as Juno soon finds out and during these nine months and right till the end of her pregnancy, Juno matures as a person and learns about life, love and a lot of other things most people at that age would not learn until much older. I realize that I 'am not going as lengthily into the plot of this film as I may have in some of my past reviews, but Juno is really a great film to experience and I feel that if I were to give away any more it wouldn't exactly be giving away any big secrets, or plot twists because the movie isn't like that, but I feel experiencing the movie without having too much knowledge or idea of how it might turn out will probably enhance your viewing pleasure because you get to see the magic of it's wonderful script and performances unfold before you and that is a far greater enjoyment than having known about the film's many quirks and wonderful characters that you may otherwise not be able to enjoy as much. The film's script is quite literally brilliant and one of the most original and heartfelt to come out of the Hollywood system in awhile. Everything from Juno's teenage urban vocabulary, the pop culture references, or just the film's wonderfully unique and charming characters that are really a treat to get to know throughout the film. While the plot of the film is simple enough there are so many different layers to all of these characters and their personalities and true self portraits get to shine during the film. And like I said because these characters are so original and at the same time so human and realistic it's authenticity is really felt. The script also features a lot of humour, great one liners and a lot of human situations that show us just how real this movie is and it is done with a real sharp taste of what it would be like for someone in this situation as well as showing the emotions, drama and life lessons including love that these characters discover. All of this is told to us with the brilliant spot on performances and the wonderful script that will make us laugh and other times warm our hearts with the loving and caring nature that the main characters show off. This past year we had Juno and Knocked Up both dealing with unplanned pregnancies and making it very humorous and at the same time very real and touching at the same moment. This film is so rich with it's writing and acted out with sheer brilliance by it's cast and it deserves a spot on the list as one of the year's best films and a wonderful performance by lead actress Ellen Page (who will likely get an Oscar if Julie Christie, or Marion Cotillard don't get it) and a real and wonderfully written script by Diablo Cody which just gets me thinking about how much I loved it by just thinking about it. This film works as a comedy, a drama, a character study and a human interest story with a lot to give it's viewers. One of the year's best.",10,1,5,5 January 2008
Don Jon," Don Jon
","Don Jon, was a film that I had to be a little patient with. What first started as a vulgar, raucous and teen oriented film having little more than jokes involving perverseness and sexual humour and was something that I figured I had wasted my money on, turned out to completely surprise me and ended up as one of my favourite films of this year. Yes, the film does have a lot of sexual humour and content in it, but it has some reason to, seeing as the film is dealing with addiction to pornography. And what may have seemed immature and like teenage humour for the first little bit of the film, soon went away and it became one of the most insightful and intelligent films of the year. I have heard the comparisons to this film from 2011's Steve McQueen directed film, Shame which is also about sexual addiction. Unfortunately, I have not seen Shame yet. I missed it at theatres and every time I go to the library to rent it, it is out, so for obvious reasons I can not compare the two of them. Don Jon, did have a lot to say both about young men and women, sex and relationships. It's the kind of film you would almost want younger teens to see in order to learn something and perhaps plan their own lives and future relationships a little more differently. Here the internet pornography sites serve as a form of escape for this main character and while he likes being around women, he can not connect with them in the same way as he feels he can with things he sees on the computer. This further complicates things for himself because what we see on the internet and in magazines often times are things that are made to look perfect, beautiful and however you want to put it, but other than just looking at it, there is no real connection, or relationship to it. It is hollow and empty and void of any emotional connection or feelings to another person. Perhaps that is why this character can not relate to real women. Everything up to now has been completely empty and void of any feeling, or connection and in his mind if he doesn't have to attach himself in any way to a real woman, he wonders what the point of that is. Throughout the course of the film, our lead character, Jon, meets two very different women, who will both change his outlook and outcome of his way of handling relationships and finding truer meaning to both himself and others as well. The film while crude and a little graphic at times, is far more into psychological and character study than one may think and it is one of the most insightful and accurate looks at young, or basically any type of relationships that I have seen in a long time. Jon, is with one woman who seems to be his dream woman, but right from the start we do not really like her, or at least I didn't. She herself had an unrealistic view of relationships that was more about status symbols and image than about real love for one another as well. The other woman we meet knows more about relationships and more about Jon himself than he may want to admit, or care for her to know, but there is a whole different type of connection and intimacy level there. The film shows that so often young men treat women as sexual objects and fantasies and actually how we can be so demeaning and almost sexist towards them. At the same time, this selfish attitude hurts other people and ourselves because we can not truly ever find anything that is real if we continue on this way because everything has to be perfect, or just like it is on movies, magazines, or the internet and it gives us a false distortion of reality, relationships and other people. The film is the first film written and directed by actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt whose acting has impressed me over the years, especially in films like Gregg Araki's Mysterious Skin. Now he shows that he can not only act, but write and direct as well. The film has moments of laugh out loud humour, but it also has a tender and emotional side to it as well. It examines these people and what is really behind them and the hurts, or the things they have been through and it is honest both about men, women and relationships in general. As the film ended, I could totally understand the way the film ended and why Levitt, decided to do it in that way. It felt realistic for his character, but at the same time also connected to beauty and happiness. I enjoyed the screenplay and direction immensely as well as the performances were all quite good as well. I liked the quick jump cut editing and the film's use of music in certain scenes, I felt worked really well also. I know some viewers will be turned off by the material and subject matter, but it really is a film worth seeing if you are in a relationship, or even if you are not and this is a film that definitely has something to say. I look forward to future writing and directing projects for Levitt, and as it stands Don Jon, is one of 2013's best and maybe most misunderstood films as well.",10,109,182,7 October 2013
Match Point," Match Point
","Match Point is set in London, England and is about a young man named Chris Wilton who is a tennis pro and now teaches others how to play tennis. Chris's friend Tom introduces him to his sister Chloe and they hit it off and are soon to be married. Chris also meets Tom's girlfriend named Nola who Chris instantly feels attracted to. Tom and Nola break up and Chris gets married to Chloe, but Chris starts to see more and more of Nola until they begin a rather serious affair. Soon, Nola wants Chris to live with her and dump Chloe, but Chris will not do it and Nola threatens to if Chris won't. This complicates matters leaving Chris having to decide between the two women and choose what to do. Winner of The David Award for Best European Film for writer/director Woody Allen at The David di Donatello Awards and The Goya Award for Best European Film at The Goya Awards. Match Point has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast and good cinematography. Even though Match Point is written and directed by Woody Allen it is nothing at all like his other films. This is not a comedy and is instead more of a drama/thriller. Also instead of being filmed in New York like most of his movies are this one was filmed in England. This is one smart and crafty story of love and an affair that goes way out of control. I liked the film's dialog and the characters were all very well played by the actors who played them and I also thought that they were very well written. This is one film were there are many important characters and elements to the script and each are written in here for a purpose and the film plays out very well. I liked the thriller style of the movie that presented itself in a classy kind of way that old thrillers from the 30's or 40's would have and I thought the movie's pace was good and the more the film went on the more curious I became of what would happen next and I was thoroughly enjoying myself at this film and I was not disappointed by the time it was over. This is one classy and smart movie that really stands out for it's writing, direction and acting. I have always been a fan of Woody Allen and his films and I understand that some people just don't care for his usual comedies. This is unlike any Woody Allen movie he has done before and it really stands out from the others and as much as I like his comedies I think that he has done a great job at doing a thriller and you do not have to be a Woody Allen fan to enjoy this movie. One of the most intriguing, smart and classy films of 2005. I heavily recommend it.",9,0,0,28 April 2006
Midnight in Paris," Midnight in Paris
","Midnight in Paris is about an engaged couple named Gil and Inez who go to Paris, France because her father is setting up a business deal there. Gil and Inez, we soon learn are very different people. He is a struggling author who loves the sights and sounds of Paris and finds it all very romantic and beautiful. His idea of a great time there would be to walk down the streets in the rain and capture the romance and beauty of the moment. Inez is more of a materialistic person who would much rather get a ride than walk in the rain and doesn't much care for Gil's opinions about art, or the different surroundings in Paris. One night while walking alone in the city, Gil is invited into an old vehicle and because he is drunk he accepts, and is then taken back to Paris in the 1920's where he gets to meet some of his favourite authors, artists and other very influential people in the field of art in the 1920's. He gets to be friends with them and for the evening gets to be with them in the 20's, but when he wakes up, he is back in 2010 with Inez. Gil goes back to the same spot every night and is taken back to his artist friends and soon meets a French woman who he starts to fall in love with, but how will he be able to stay in the 1920's permanently and what will he do about Inez? I absolutely loved Midnight in Paris. I have never actually been to Paris, or any parts in France, but have seen a lot of French films and pieces of art to know that it is a classy and beautiful city and this film captures that beauty and magic. It is a gorgeous looking film with it's cinematography as well as the sets and costumes. The film has tons of great one liners and made me smile frequently throughout the film. The whole cast is great and all do an excellent job here. The idea behind the movie is really intriguing and it makes for some very entertaining viewing and it sure made me feel good after I saw it. This is a film that is so light and funny and absolutely charming that I found it hard not to love every minute about it. The dialogue is great, the story is funny, romantic, fascinating and entertaining and it is definitely beautiful to look at as well. This film captures a lot of what is classic and sentimental from classic films by giving us a very original idea and humour and giving it class, innocence and beauty. I think fans of classic films will love this movie as well as anyone who enjoys good movies and comedies that are smart and do not rely on raunch, or bad language. Midnight in Paris really brightened up my evening and a certain joy came out of watching this film. I highly recommend it and I hope it is a hit at next year's Oscars because I think it is one of this year's best films and a true masterpiece.",Null,3,3,22 September 2011
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Hellboy 2: The Golden Army
","Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is based upon the comic book of the same name by Mike Mignola and was previously a live action film entitled 'Hellboy' in 2004. In the film a beer drinking and cigar smoking misunderstood mutant with attitude who also acts as a superhero along with a special team set up by the government, has more on his plate to deal with when some other mystical creatures with evil plans come around and an above average comic book film with outstanding makeup, sets and special effects follow. In case you have not already noticed, 2008 is definitely the year of the comic book movie. We have gone from Iron Man to the Hulk and this summer's most anticipated superhero movie The Dark Knight hasn't even been released yet. To some people all these hero movies must be someone's dream summer for movies, I on the other hand am getting tired of it real quick. I would much rather be watching an original thought provoking character study, or just something entirely new and not based upon previously published material like a comic book, video game, television series, etcetera. I guess I will probably have to wait till fall to get my wish. It's not like Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is a bad film, no far from it, but it still follows the same type of hero formula that we have seen all too often in past years and even within the first few summer months of this year with the kind of films the distributors are releasing. Hellboy 2 is probably a lot better than the previous hero films of the summer because it's makeup and visuals are outstanding and almost cry for effects Oscars and there was a good deal of humour, personality and even edge to these characters and the story, which made it more than just a clich√© of these type of films. A lot of the different creatures in this film look fantastic and to design some of these things one must admit and admire all the talent that went behind it. Still there was enough in here that was fairly predictable and by the books. Had it been a little darker, or spent a little more time with these characters that were more interesting than the plot itself, than it could have been a lot better. Also, I found that the film did drag a bit in the second half and I was beginning to lose interest. Judging by the online reviews and the reviews of critics, I'm sure this film will be a hit commercially and with the film going audience. And while it is not a bad film it is still nothing new, or exciting and I probably would have had more of an experience seeing one of my own movies in my collection. 2008 is so far a very weak year for movies, especially compared to last year's really good line-up, and one can hope that it will only get better.",8,3,7,12 July 2008
Cloverfield," Cloverfield
","Cloverfield is about a group of young adults who while having a party discover that some enormous creature is rampaging through the streets and that buildings are being destroyed and people are dying. The film features only a handful of main characters fleeing from the monster and one of them has a hand-held camera with him, so basically what he films is what we see. There were things I liked about Cloverfield and some things that only made it an okay film for me instead of a great one. The whole idea of a film being seen from the hand-held camera point of view isn't exactly new, but I thought the filmmakers did an interesting twist with this and it gave us a more personal side to the people running from the creature. While the hand-held camera movements were very shaky and did make me kind of motion sick and nauseated, I still appreciated this original way of storytelling and handling the movie. Another thing I liked about the film is that even though it is released by a big mainstream distributor and got a wide release, it didn't really feel like a big Hollywood movie at all because of how everything happened realistically and for a monster film it didn't really feel all that preposterous at times because of how real the characters, their situation and how they handled it was. Also there are not a lot of big fancy special effects, or camera tricks here making the film look more gritty and real. Because the film is not predictable and doesn't suffer from old horror movie formulas that have been done to death I applauded the film for it's original take on this genre of film as well as the direction and storytelling. Other than making me a bit nauseated, which I don't count as a negative feeling for the movie the only real problem I had with the film is that it started to drag a bit in the middle and the suspense and intensity of the film as well as the characters really started to die off for me in the second half. Had it been a little more suspenseful and had a little bit more action, or just anything else to keep my interest up, it would have made this film a really good one rather than just an okay one. Still, I was pleased that a mainstream Hollywood company would release a film as different and original as this, so I can say that that impresses me, but the film itself is only okay and I do feel it could have been a bit better.",7,0,2,26 January 2008
Silent Hill," Silent Hill
","Silent Hill is based on a popular video game and now it has been made into a full length film. The story is about a mother named Rose whose daughter Sharon often walks in her sleep and talks about a place called Silent Hill. When Rose confronts Sharon about it she tells her that she does not remember. Soon Rose finds out that there is a place called Silent Hill and decides to take Sharon there to see if it brings back some memories and to see why she always mentions it while sleep walking. On the way into Silent Hill they have an accident and soon Sharon is missing. Silent Hill is a deserted town with nobody around. Rose looks around the mysterious town for Sharon and discovers many horrors and evil as she goes along. At the end of this film I had mixed feelings for it. Some things I liked about the film was the way it looked with it's cinematography, great visual and special effects and a stylish and creepy look that I just loved. I also liked how the film looked and felt like a nightmare come to life because there were creepy things going on and it didn't always make sense and it felt like the characters were almost in a dream world. I liked the whole aspect of that. Now onto the things I didn't like so much about the film. I thought it started out interesting enough, but as the film went on I found it kind of slow moving and with a running time of over two hours I found the film a bit too long. Near the end of the film I also found it to be a bit too silly and some of the acting was too over the top for me and some of the dialog wasn't very well written either which made the film look awkward near the end. I still liked the look of the film a lot and I liked the concept up to the end, so there were some strong points in this film, but I just didn't thing it tied it too well together at the end and I think the film could have been a bit shorter. I've never played the video game that the film is based on, so I wouldn't be able to say whether fans of the game will like the movie or not, but I'm sure there is an audience for this movie and they will probably like it. I didn't think this was a terrible movie, but rather a flawed movie that could have been a lot better than it was.",6,0,3,22 April 2006
Crash," Crash
","Crash, is about the lives of several people who deal with racism in some way shape or form in their everyday lives. Crash, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everybody involved, good original music and good cinematography. There were many things I liked about Crash, and then some things I did not like about it. The film deals with racism and that is the main theme of the movie but the director focuses on it so much that after awhile it feels like he is trying to teach a lesson on it and makes us his students watching an educational film on racism. I thought it went a little overboard and after awhile it felt like the movie was nothing more than a film trying to show us what is right and what is wrong and how miserable these people are because of it. The film also gives us a moral ending that maybe we will be all better if we change our ways and are not racist. The film also felt like sometimes it wanted to shock us with these racist characters and situations just for the sake of shocking us and make the world a better place and get it's morals across but at the end the film doesn't have much to say other than do this because it is right and don't do that because it is wrong. And near the end of the movie I felt like the director was trying so hard to make us care about these characters and identify with them that it almost got a little sappy. It's like he wanted us to cry or feel depressed just to get this message across but it doesn't work. At least for me it didn't. The film is also jumbled and doesn't deal with having so many characters in one film too well and during the second half of the movie it started to get slower and felt like it dragged at times. The film started out good and it has some good scenes and is interesting for the most part and has good performances but ultimately I found the movie too preachy about it's message and the film is so concerned with it's message that it does little else with the film. I still enjoyed the film enough with it's performances and involving first half but because of this relentless preaching and the jumbled plot of the film I don't think it is the masterpiece critics are making it out to be.",7,1,10,15 May 2005
BlacKkKlansman," Blackkklansman
","Spike Lee has not had a commercial, or critical hit since 2006's Inside Man, and after that he would often attempt to get bigger films off the ground such as Miracle at St. Anna, or his remake of Oldboy, a few years ago, but both films were neither received well, nor did they have the box office receipts to prove they were hits, in fact the complete opposite. Lee, who I have always admired as a filmmaker, did get other projects going since and during that time, but mostly they were smaller films that would only play in the very biggest of cities meaning that if you lived anywhere else you would either have to rent, buy, or stream the films in order to keep up to date with his body of work. Lee needed a film that was both going to be a critical success, but also one that would attract audiences and actually make some money as well. When his new film, Blackkklansman premiered at Cannes, I am certainly not sure what audiences, or critics were expecting, but the result turned out to be Lee's best reviewed film in probably longer than a decade as well as winning some of the top prizes at Cannes, which in my mind because of their very particular, yet often right on the money judgements, this meant that Lee's new film was great, but how would audiences fare and let alone the movie when it had a theatrical release date right in the middle of summer which we often know can be very difficult for smaller and more intelligent films? Blackkklansman continued to earn rave reviews as more critics were able to see it and the film was even given a wide release by it's distributor and the film was made for roughly 15 million dollars and after not even a month of release it has already doubled that amount in box office returns and has many saying that it is certainly a contender for Best Picture at next year's Oscars and in my mind, I wouldn't be surprised if the film, or Lee himself were standing on that stage next year picking up their awards. Having now seen the film myself, I will have to be honest and say that the style and tone of the film was a bit of a surprise to me because I was not expecting it to be so comedic and yet I found it often worked by also dealing with pretty upsetting subject matter and allowing us a chance to breathe and also to get immersed within the film and have a good chuckle as well as getting some hard hitting material as well, so I felt the balance which at first may have taken a little bit to get used to, ended up working beautifully. The story in itself is one of this year, or any recent year's most interesting plots around and the fact that it is all based upon a true story further adds fascination and a great emotional impact at the end of the film. The performances both by the leading cast as well as supporting were all fantastic and some of the best of the year. The script which Lee had a hand in writing is often smart, funny, intriguing and like any of Lee's best films, it also hits home and gets a point across that will certainly leave you shaken and stunned by the time you have walked out of the theatre. Lee has always been known for being angry at the world's injustices especially regarding race and this new film is no different. I appreciated that the violence in the film was toned down and realistically there was very little of it, so I think it would also bring more viewers in that way. The racial hatred, bigotry and language of which the film has lots, can be offensive and almost sickening at times, but we know why Lee went for this and he certainly gets his point across and then some. This is a film that is fascinating entertainment and also entertainment that will make you think about what you have just seen and may even change the way you look at current events and American history itself. The all too true aspect that is most disturbing is that this kind of hatred and acts of violence still exist and there are too many of these type of stories in the news today which makes the message of this film all the more timely and prevalent. This is one of the year's best films if not the best film of the year so far.",10,8,16,3 September 2018
Pan's Labyrinth," Pan's Labyrinth
","Pan's Labyrinth is a Mexican film in Spanish with English subtitles. The film is set in the 1940's in Spain and is about a young girl named Ofelia who comes with her mother to live with her evil stepfather who is an army general during the end of World War 2. To escape the sadness and evil around her, Ofelia discovers a labyrinth in the back of the house and meets a creature who resembles a faun who tells her that she is a princess and must complete several tasks to come back to her kingdom. Ofelia does these tasks and is taken away into strange new worlds and are introduced to several unique creatures. In the real world Ofelia's mother is pregnant and with her evil and overbearing stepfather things are getting a lot worse and seeing as the film is set in the mid 40's during a fascist Spain there is a lot of violence and evil going on around her and sometimes in order to escape that Ofelia will have to go back inside the imaginary world to complete her tasks in order to be somewhere safer even though danger lurks in the fantasy worlds as well. Winner of over 22 awards so far, Pan's Labyrinth has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design and good makeup. Before I state what I liked about the film I would like to get the fact that although this is a fantasy film and looks like it would be great for children that it is probably not suitable for them receiving an R rating in the states for graphic violence and language, so parents please be advised. Getting that out of the way I must say that I really enjoyed this film. When Ofelia is in the fantasy worlds they are full of beauty and are gorgeous looking and at the same time they are often wonderfully grotesque and weird, so the look and effects of this film are fantastic. The imagination behind writer/director Guillermo del Toro is amazing and he has created a wonderful blend of fantasy and real life horror that balances out well and plays perfectly. When in the real world everything is dark, dreary and depressing looking, but while in the fantasy land everything is usually bright and more cheerful. This film plays out like a perfect fairy tale with dark elements, a hero, a villain and lots of weird stuff in between to keep us amazed and to capture our interest. The film is very dark, but anyone who has read fairy tales will be able to tell you that most of them are and it suit's the film and it's style very well. This is a gorgeous looking, creative, interesting and very well done film that is one of the best films of the year and I'm glad there is finally a fantasy film out there for adults to enjoy. I really enjoy fantasy films, but the majority of the recent stuff out there like Lord Of The Rings or Harry Potter isn't really my style, so I'm happy to say that this film certainly filled the bill and I was very impressed by the end of it. For those who are into fantasy and don't mind that the film is dark then you are in for a great story and a wonderful world of surprise that the filmmaker captures for you. I hope this film continues to do well and I hope the fact that it is subtitled does not hold people back from seeing it because it really is an amazing film and meant to be seen.",8,4,8,10 February 2007
Knocked Up," Knocked Up
","Knocked Up is about a young man named Ben Stone who doesn't work and just sits around and hangs out with his friends hoping they can get a celebrity nudity site off the ground. One night at a bar Ben meets Alison Scott and one thing leads to another and after not seeing each other for awhile she finds out that she is pregnant with his child. Alison gets back in touch with Ben and the two of them try to work things out and accept that they have a few things to change and accept while making way for a baby in their lives. The film is a comedy, but with some heartfelt and dramatic moments as well. Knocked Up is by the co-writer and director of The 40 Year Old Virgin which is one of my favourite comedies of the last few years and one of my favourite films of 2005. Once again writer/director Judd Apatow blends together crude comedy, drama and a lot of life situations that are actually very well thought out and written. Someone going by the trailer of this film might dismiss it as being a stoner comedy or just another crudely done sexual movie. Well the film does have those moments and when it does it is often very funny and some of the jokes referencing things from pop culture to just plain buddy talk is also well written with sharp dialogue and works because of the great writing and from the great performances by the main stars and it's strong supporting cast as well. The film works also as a film about dealing with the future and issues that like it or not, may happen to a lot of people out there, but instead of condoning what they do the film shows the good times and bad and also how Ben and Alison start to grow on each other and how willing they are to work with each other for their upcoming child. The dramatic scenes are also played out with humour and work well with it's more gentle and softer side that works well also because of good character chemistry and the fact that we are able to believe these characters and what are happening to them and because of the sharp writing, performances and humour that go along with it. In a month where we are bombarded with unnecessary Hollywood sequels and just bad popcorn films, I hope that people will go see Knocked Up because of how well it works on so many levels and because of the talent and skill behind it. It will appeal to those looking for a date movie or a comedy and this film will appeal to both men and women. Knocked Up is certainly one of the most entertaining films of the year so far and also one of the most thought provoking and genuinely sincere and funny films of the year as well. This will be one of my most favourite films of 2007 and after two great films in a row I look forward to seeing what Judd Apatow brings us next because for a modern day comedy when most of what we see is unoriginal and just isn't very good, this is the exception and it is a comedic masterwork.",10,2,8,2 June 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street is based upon the stage musical of the same name by Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler. The film is set in a very poor, dirty and dark London, England where a man named Benjamin Barker is introduced to us. We find out that he once was a happy barber married to a beautiful wife and had a new baby daughter till all this was taken away from him by a corrupt judge named Judge Turpin who sentences Benjamin to jail for 15 years, so he can end up having his wife. The 15 years have passed and Benjamin is out of prison and now goes under the name Sweeney Todd. He then meets a woman named Mrs. Lovett who lets him stay in her upstairs room above her pie shop. Sweeney has plans for revenge against the judge and the town, so he starts up his barbershop business again only to lure clients in and then slit their throats. To dispose of the bodies he decides along with Mrs. Lovett to make them into meat pies and sell them. Sure enough the pies become a hit. Meanwhile, Sweeney wants his daughter back from Judge Turpin and with a young man who is in love with her they plan a way to get her back and Sweeney also plans to take on his revenge for the Judge and continue to keep the bodies piling high. All this of course is set to musical numbers which are sung by the main characters of the cast. I first found out about the stage play musical of Sweeney Todd in my high school drama class when a teacher was telling us the general plot about it and from that moment on the story intrigued me and having always had a love of musicals it was definitely a musical I wanted to see. Thankfully, I have now seen Tim Burton's adaptation of the musical for the screen and I was very impressed. The film's set, costumes and makeup all give the film the bleak and depressing look it needs while really setting the mood for the film and playing as a backdrop to the story. The story itself is full of catchy and well done songs and it is also filled with morbid humour, lots of blood, dead bodies and one of the most interesting, original and wickedly entertaining plots to come along in awhile. Morbid and dark films have also appealed to me probably because my love of the different and the strange and as I mentioned earlier I have also enjoyed musicals, so all the ingredients (no pun intended) were here for me to completely enjoy this film and I did. The film was completely unpredictable from start to finish and I had no idea in which the direction of the story was going, but by the end of the film I was very satisfied with how the film ended and played out. The original, dark and plain out genius story was further enhanced by great acting, music and a lot of style and mood created by the backdrops and Tim Burton's wonderful eye of the macabre and the visually beautiful yet disturbing imagery. The film plays out like any classic musical you can think of, only it's rare you get one this violent or gruesome. However that just added to my enjoyment of the film because the darker and more wild this film got the more my interest grew and it kept my attention for the duration of it's length. If you like horror movies and happen to not mind musicals then this will definitely be a film for you. For musical lovers who do not like horror or the macabre then you best look elsewhere, but for people who appreciate both you will have a downright good time with this film. Definitely one of the year's best.",10,2,8,22 December 2007
Black Mass," Black Mass
","After a string of critical and box office flops such as The Lone Ranger, Transcendence and Mortdecai, Johnny Depp was in need of a box office and critical hit. Some critics are saying that this new film, Black Mass, will be Depp's comeback role and may even net him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, but I think personally that those critics are being too premature. Thankfully for the most part, I tend to choose what I watch very carefully, so I have avoided those three recent Depp features that I mentioned earlier in this review. However, I have found that in the last 15 years or so, that Depp's roles and the movies that he is being offered are not what they used to be. I know that the Pirates of the Caribbean movies are really popular with fans of all ages and just recently I attempted to watch three of the entries in that film series with having the ultimate outcome of me caring very little for it. Some of the visuals and makeup and effects can be neat enough at times, but that is not what I look for in a movie. To me they are just more or less like big budget action films catered to a younger audience that despite whether critics love them, or hate them, they are going to make a lot of money. As for Depp in the films, I feel that his role as Captain Jack Sparrow is essentially a one note performance and while it may have worked in the first Pirates movie, I now think it is getting old and there is really nothing new, or relevant to say about what has become an iconic character, or films. The films themselves are just mediocre and the performance just feels old now because we have seen it so many times now and I feel there is nothing new, or revitalizing that they can now bring to that franchise. Despite my thoughts another film is currently in the works in that series which is slated to be released next year. I also find that other Depp roles recently have gotten too over the top and almost cartoonish in a way and I feel that it certainly hurts the films themselves and makes Depp often seem annoying, or really trying too hard for no reason. I'll list Tim Burton's failed Alice in Wonderland version as an example of this. I particularly liked Johnny Depp in the 90's where he was in a string of really original films, but gave great performances and depth to the characters as well. Think of films like Edward Scissorhands, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Ed Wood, Dead Man and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas just to name a few films from that time period. These films were actually great films and featured great Depp performances in them as well, but sadly it almost seems as if he is getting away from those smaller yet vastly better films. With, Black Mass it is possible that the film could earn Depp an Academy Award nomination, but for myself I would not nominate him personally. While he is good in the role of real life gangster Whitey Bulger, I feel that often the role is downplayed a bit and when Bulger, should be menacing and almost scary he comes off more subdued and even passive and I think the result of a terrifying and intimidating gangster is not really something the film, or the performance managed to pull off. I appreciated that the film showed different aspects of Bulger's character and not just as a violent psychopath, and I often found that some of the more quiet and personal scenes were more effective in both terms of acting and writing. Another thing I found that I think others will too is the fact that Depp's Bulger seems to be more of a supporting character and doesn't really carry the film in any way and is more of a background character. Whether that was intentional, or not I do not know, but the others characters when they were on screen did not seem to have quite as much screen presence and weren't as interesting to watch. I actually found the best performances in the film to be small supporting performances from typically great performers such as Juno Temple, Peter Sarsgaard and Dakota Johnson. Their roles are quite strong, but I feel are some of the best in the film and I almost wished they could have been in the film longer than they actually were because they were omitting off great performances and because of that they were fascinating to watch and added more to the film that sadly for the rest of it was missing. Black Mass, is not a bad film, but neither is it the great masterpiece I think a lot of people were hoping for. It is just simply an average film in pretty much every way except for a few bright performances which I mentioned above and also some of the cinematography was quite good at times as well. I think another thing that holds this film back is it really doesn't bring anything new to the screen. We have seen these type of mob films before and much better ones, so unfortunately there is nothing to distinguish this one apart from the countless others that have come out before it. It is a film that I think because it plays out like something you have seen before and also because it adds nothing new to the table that after it leaves theatres it will be a film you will see on television now and again, but will quickly be forgotten by a lot of people because there is just nothing really memorable about it.",7,2,10,21 September 2015
Nacho Libre," Nacho Libre
","Nacho Libre takes place in Mexico and is about a man named Nacho who works at a religious orphanage as the cook. The orphanage has no fresh ingredients for food, so the food that Nacho cooks is terrible. Having always been a fan of Mexican wrestling, Nacho meets a young man named Esqueleto who agrees to train with him and be a wrestling team together. The two of them never seem to win any of their fights, but they get paid even if they don't win, so they continue to do this, but must keep it a secret because the orphanage considers wrestling wrong. Also when a new nun named Sister Encarnacion comes to the orphanage Nacho falls in love with her and wants to impress her, but also must keep the wrestling a secret from her as well. Nacho Libre has good direction, a good script and a good comedic performance by Jack Black (who plays Nacho) as well as a good supporting cast. I was really surprised how much I liked Nacho Libre. I found it to be an entertaining movie and it had a lot of offbeat characters and situations which I really liked. This is a movie that is really different than a lot of the other summer movies that are coming out right now and that is one reason I liked this movie. It's humour, characters and situations all use a bizarre and original type of humour that I feel works well and it helps make the movie more unique and special than some of the other comedies out there. I also liked the film's story and there are some amusing parts as well as some sweet and touching moments that go along with this story. A lot of people said that this movie didn't look too good after they saw the trailers and I'm sure to a lot of people the movie does look silly and juvenile, but I think if you like odd humour and can appreciate a movie like Napoleon Dynamite (which is also by the same director here and co-writers) which had a similar sense of style and humour than you should be able to appreciate this film as well. This type of humour isn't for everyone which probably leads to some of the negative reviews you might have read for the film, but I was thoroughly entertained by this film and I think it will appeal to both adults and kids as a fun movie for everyone. With it's fun and well paced story and off the wall humour I definitely recommend Nacho Libre to fans of that type of humour and of similar movies like the film Napoleon Dynamite.",8,2,5,26 June 2006
The Town," The Town
","The Town is based on the novel Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan. The film takes place in Boston, Massachusetts and we soon learn that this is one of the biggest bank robbery capitals in America. As the film goes along we are introduced to a team of bank robbers, who after several elaborate heists have always managed to walk away with a lot of money and still have not been arrested, or caught for it. We also meet an FBI team who is closing in on the robbers because of enough background information and evidence they have to finally get their culprits, if only they can catch them in the act. There is also a romance that blossoms in the film, but due to the circumstances of the characters, it is going to take deceit and eventually loyalty to make it work, if it does end up working at all. If you see the film, you will know what I am talking about. The film is all about loyalty to friends, loved ones and even the authorities and all these different characters will be put into a situation of which to choose to best suit their lives and the ones around them. When I first saw trailers for The Town several months ago at the theatre, I already thought then that this looked like it was going to be a really good movie. The trailers and my expectations were correct. What I was surprised by though, was that The Town wasn't the movie I thought it was going to be. The trailers made the film look a certain way and while I was watching it, I discovered that in a lot of ways it was a different film than advertised. This is not a complaint because I loved the final product. The Town works because of it's tight script which has some very good character study and development and it puts the different characters in tough situations and moral dilemmas and watching them decide what to do that will be best for themselves, but also for the ones around them, I found fascinating to watch and fairly realistic and not clich√©d, or predictable at all, which I really compliment the film on. The film also has a terrific pace to it. It does have very little action scenes in it and they are not really needed to make this film more exciting. I say this because the lives of these characters become so involving to us that we really want to see what happens between them and what decisions they make and we do get in a sense to even care for them. It is so involving and fascinating that the over two hour running time is rarely felt because everything is so captivating. The acting is all very good here as well. I would not single out a single performance as being the best because I think the whole cast really does good work here. The direction is tight and focused and really brings the film together and makes for a really entertaining and thrilling watch. Last week I reviewed the Australian film Animal Kingdom which is also about criminal activities. In some ways they are the same and in some they are different. I personally liked The Town better because I really felt we got to know these characters better and the on screen chemistry was great. This film also successfully blends different genres including drama, action and even romance and all were pulled off terrifically and it felt more human to me. The Town is one of the best films of 2010 and I am glad it is doing so well with critics, audiences and the box office.",10,0,2,18 October 2010

The film starts out with a young man named Dan, looks across the street at a young woman named Alice, and immediately becomes fascinated with her. A few moments later Alice, is involved in an accident and Dan, goes with her to the hospital and soon they start to become friends. A year passes and the two are now a couple. Dan, has just got off publishing a book about Alice's life and is being photographed by a photographer named Anna, who he soon gets a crush on and starts seeing. Also a lonely doctor named Larry, finds Anna at an aquarium after a cruel dating joke on the internet and soon falls in love with her. The characters can't settle on one love though and through the film they all end up hurting each other with betrayal and lies after all four of the people meet. Winner of The NBR Award for Best Acting By An Ensemble at The National Board Of Review. Closer, has good direction, a good screenplay, great performances by everyone involved (including an Oscar worthy performance by Natalie Portman as Alice, and Clive Owen as Larry), good cinematography, good film editing and good set decoration. Closer, has great dialogue with rich and fascinating conversations the characters indulge in, the film has a great ensemble cast and is well made, as a well thought out script, some very powerful and emotional scenes, it is fascinating, compelling, a good character study and is an entertaining and well made film. The end seemed to drag and felt a little long at times but that is only a minor complaint. A very good film which I hope gets nominated for it's great dialogue filled screenplay and excellent performances by Natalie Portman and Clive Owen. One of the year's best films.",8,3,4,5 February 2005
Shutter Island," Shutter Island
","Shutter Island is based upon the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. The film takes place in the mid 1950's where a United States Marshal named Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule are sent to an island where there is a maximum security prison for patients with mental health disorders and many of them have become violent and are there because they have killed others. Teddy's assignment is to locate a patient who went missing. The task seems almost possible, due to the fact that the island is in the middle of nowhere and because of all the security around and because the island is surrounded by tons of rocks and water and you would not be able to get off the island alive. While at the institution Teddy soon discovers that not everything is as it seems and he could be the next one in danger while visiting and investigating this case. Shutter Island is proof that there are still great horror films being made today that are not remakes of other films and ones that have original ideas and are made to perfection. The script grabbed me almost instantly and it is not particularly an action packed film, rather more of a character study and a psychological horror film that keeps giving you clues and building up the suspense until the final moments of the film. This is one classy horror film with tons of atmosphere to the music, direction and sets to a wonderfully captivating and twist turning and fascinating story. Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Teddy gives one of his all time best performances here and shows us a man who has his own demons that he is facing and why he comes off the way he does and why solving the mystery of the island and institution is so important to him. The supporting actors all do a great job as well and add to our curiosity of the film and exactly how it will play out. This film reminded me a lot of the classic horror films where it doesn't really rely on a lot of brutal violence, or things jumping out at you, or loud noises to get you scared. This film does it by building an atmosphere what with a creepy and brooding musical score, well developed and mysterious characters and by the script which keeps adding more and more for us to digest and piece together until we really want to see what happens at the end. The thrills come from watching these characters (Teddy in particular) in torment and wrestling with his personal problems and things that could easily make, or break this case for him and his strong determination to see it to the end and unravel what he thinks the mystery of the island is. Teddy's character alone is fascinating to watch all by itself because of DiCaprio's great performance and by how many layers there are to this character. Through the film we see things from Teddy's past that may seem insignificant at first, but in the end you will see that everything is in here for a reason and it all sort of makes sense at the end. It is one of those films that you will have to interpret in your own way and I appreciated that about the film as well. And as I was saying watching Teddy and his past traumas and the things that have brought him to be the man he is now, one with little patience and quite aggressive and how he slowly starts to get worse as the film goes on is absolutely fascinating to watch, again from DiCaprio's great performance and the wonderful material he was given to work with. I sat in utter awe of this film and what I was watching before me because I got so into the plot, the characters and wondering what would happen, that I could not take my view anywhere else other than on the screen. The audience I viewed the film with seemed to have the same fascination as I did because there have not been too many times when I have sat in a completely full theatre and to have complete silence from the audience the whole way through. Whether they all liked the film as much as I did, I do not know. However it did keep their interest and must have fascinated them in one way, or other and had some type of effect on them. Many will unfortunately, probably come into this film hoping for a violent and terrifying film like a lot of the films that come out today in the horror genre. This is one of the better ones that relies on an original and fascinating script, lots of atmosphere to build the mood and suspense of the film and great actors delivering great performances from top notch material. All the elements of a great horror film are here and they all play out beautifully. This is the first film I have seen of 2010 and I already know that it will be among my favourites of this year by the time it is over. A great film worth seeing for fans of horror, thrillers or just good psychological character studies. Heavily recommended.",10,2,9,24 February 2010

Capote has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by the entire cast (and I' am positive Phillip Seymour Hoffman will win this year's Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Truman Capote), good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The film is well crafted and well made and really focuses on its story and characters showing their good and bad sides and concentrates on what makes them do the things they do. The film also had some very good character study. I also found that the movie had a good pace and was absorbing and compelling. While watching this film I became interested in what was going on and this is one movie where the characters and the things they do and the choices they makes fascinates you. The film is also riveting and a stylishly made film that looks like it just came out of the 50's time period. Overall a compelling and very well made film that I'm sure will continue to win more awards and get the attention of more theatre goers.",8,1,2,6 February 2006
Life of Pi," Life of Pi
","I remember when the novel Life of Pi came out and how popular it was. I have never read the book, but have read Beatrice and Virgil, which is also by Pi author Yann Martel and was very impressed with it. The movie version of Life of Pi, was nothing short of amazing. This is a film where everything seems to be done right. As readers of my reviews know, I am not a fan of 3D, or basically even in seeing films in 3D, but to me, Life of Pi was different. The 3D was not used in a self indulgent way to showcase today's technology, or to brag about it later on like so much of Peter Jackson's later films have been. Instead the 3D in this film is done to further enhance emotions and to affect us while watching certain scenes. We often see scenes of absolute beauty and some that are frightening, or perhaps ugly, but the 3D here is put to good use and is not done in an overly flashy way. The story itself I found to be incredibly moving and also inspiring. I do not want to go into too many details about the plot, so I do not spoil it for other viewers, but this is at times a deeply spiritual film that most viewers should walk away with feeling moved and grasping things that they might not have before. That is unless they are totally hard of heart. Through the journey of the main character, Pi, he learns so many important life lessons and things he can use later on in life. The film shows that while he does go through some very difficult and challenging times, that he does not quit, or give up and has the willpower and the faith to persevere even if at times everything looks absolutely hopeless. By relying not only on himself, but a higher power he is giving this endurance and strength to keep going and even during the most agonizing and stressful of times, he still has that perseverance and does not give up. It shows us that through life's trials often something very good comes out of it. In life none of us like going through challenging, or difficult times, but I think all of us can say that through difficult situations that we have gone through that we have learned more about ourselves and have become better equipped for future situations as well. Trials often bring us closer to the things that are actually important and crucial to our lives, but on the same thought, I realize that others do not always respond to them as well and lean to things that could be detrimental to one's health such as drugs, alcohol, or sex, but what if we relied on a higher power like Pi does in the film? Being a Christian myself I know all about that. Through my life I have gone through numerous trails in my life and I know that there will be more coming, but through all of those trials, I have been able to rely on God, and while often in those situations I felt anxious, or like giving up myself, I learned that he was with me through those trials and he was not going to abandon me. Every rough, or difficult situation in life I have gotten through. No, going through it was not always easy, or fun, but at the end my relationship with God improved and it often allowed me to trust and rely on Him more. Often these trials seem to be pointing out something in our lives that we need to change about ourselves. It could be something like an addiction, or some type of sin that while it may not seem so, is actually harming us rather than bringing us joy, or pleasure and do we really need those things in our life? What if we could live doing what is good for us and to keep our bodies healthy. Wouldn't that make us both happier, healthier and more appreciative that we gave up our old ways of sin, addiction and the things that caused us to stumble. Pi grows in this film as he goes through these trials. They mature him, give him a stronger and more trusting relationship and understanding of God and helps prepare and shape him for what may come in days, weeks, or even years ahead. This was such a revelation to me seeing all this on screen. I knew all this beforehand, but who doesn't need a reminder from time to time and a little encouragement never fails to help. What was often called an unfilmable book has turned into a motion picture experience that is something that I found beautiful for the eyes, ears, senses and my soul. I felt uplifted and encouraged as I left this film. It gave me so much to think about, but also so much to be thankful for in my own life. Director Ang Lee and screenwriter David Magee have given us a beautiful film here that works as a technical achievement, but on so many other levels as well. I hope that what I have said will not have turned off people from seeing it, but rather given them a curiosity to go and see it for themselves and see what they discover, or take away from it. This is a groundbreaking achievement in cinema and for our own selves as well. Be sure to see it on the big screen while you can. One of 2012's best films.",10,43,74,25 November 2012
American Sniper," American Sniper
","It's hard to review the new film, American Sniper, without mentioning, or at least briefly discussing the various controversies and differences of opinions concerning one's morals and values and the film itself. For that reason alone, I find it essential to mention these things in this review and also to explain my own thoughts on the matter as well. American Sniper, is based on the true story of Chris Kyle, who went on to serve four tours of duty in Iraq, during the war in the early 2000's and became known as one of the best and most lethal snipers of all time. The film details his accounts while on duty in Iraq, as well as his relationship and marriage to his wife, Taya, and the different effects, Kyle dealt with after his enlistment. One could say that the film is bigoted and promotes hate towards Arabs, and those during the war at that time. It is a fair criticism as the film shows scenes of intensity and violence with little, or no empathy for those being killed and almost glorifying and condoning what the Americans are doing. I am not here to say that the war following the 9/11 attacks was a good thing, or a bad thing, but I think certain sensitivities should still be kept in balance when making a film like this, even if the other side is labelled as the enemies and that is where the war itself is taking place. Another criticism was the film's pro and glorified use of weapons and war itself. The film certainly does seem to be pro war and pro American troops and from the first few minutes of the film to the end credits, it does not hide this fact. Some have said that Kyle himself and his portrayal by Bradley Cooper, makes him look like a psychopath with no empathy, or feelings towards those he is killing, or the type of job he is doing and having no remorse for it. On that part, I would have to disagree. I know little to nothing about the real Chris Kyle, other than what I just observed in this film and going by the film, I would have to say that in Cooper's performance you do see that he is bound and determined to protect the troops with him, himself and the people back home in the country he loves, but I could see glimpses of hesitation and sometimes guilt with what he was doing when the killings took on a more personal meaning and role for him, especially after he has a wife and family of his own. You see that later he hesitates and sometimes does not want to do, what he is forced to do and later these such events and the brutality and violence and deaths that he witnessed will later come back to haunt him. He is still patriotic and will not turn down his duty, but at the same time, I can not say that he always, or even ever enjoyed it, or found it to be particularly easy. Some have said that the film makes Kyle a hero and one to almost be praised, or worshipped. I can see the evidence of such remarks, but I think the main task of the filmmakers here is to show an unbiased account of Kyle and everything he went through both during and after his tour of duty. He was certainly patriotic and killed a lot of people in the line of duty, but as I mentioned above, I do not always think it was the most easiest thing for him to do and you can see where he has hesitations, doubt and even sometimes questions what he is doing after having a family and loved ones of his own makes him question life and what he is doing more. Also later when Kyle is suffering from PTSD we can certainly see that all of this has taken it's toll on him and he certainly didn't escape unaffected, or unscathed from his experiences. Simply put, if you do not agree with war and look down on it and the American troops and any glorification of war, or violence, whether you agree with my points, or not, then this film is certainly not for you and I would not go to spend money to see it at the theatre. With my own political views and ideologies, I have to admit that they do flip flop from time to time and I do not support one political party more than the other at the present moment. Sometimes, I will like what one party is doing and then totally be against the other and vice versa. Ultimately, I would say I have become cynical of politics and politicians and do not always know what to believe, or support when it comes to issues such as this. As a film, American Sniper is tightly directed with excellent writing, editing and performances. Bradley Cooper, gives a subtle performance where he doesn't show a lot of emotion on the outside, but inwardly you can often tell what is character is feeling and the struggles he is going through. Sienna Miller, is equally as good as his wife. The film is powerful and extremely well done and is certainly a film that will make you think and gives a lot of food for thought and things to debate. For that reason alone it is an excellent film and worth seeing.",10,10,25,29 January 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," The Devil Wears Prada
","The Devil Wears Prada is based upon the novel of the same name by Lauren Weisberger. The film is about a young woman named Andy Sachs who gets a job at a fashion magazine as an assistant to the magazine's editor named Miranda Priestly. Andy finds out that working for Miranda is no easy task having to answer and take calls from Miranda all day and do several errands for her without ever being thanked or told that she is doing a good job. Miranda is a very tough boss and enough to make some people go crazy. A co-worker at the magazine named Nigel starts to get friendly with Andy and gives her a whole new wardrobe seeing as everyone who works at the magazine is fashion obsessed and Andy's previous clothes were bringing her ridicule. Andy's family and friends are soon realizing that Andy is spending all of her free time doing things for her job and that she is neglecting them and herself. Eventually, Andy will have to make a decision on whether to stick to a job that millions of young women would kill for or continue to work for a woman like Miranda and continue ignoring her family and friends. The Devil Wears Prada has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, great performances by the main cast members and a good supporting cast as well, good film editing and good costume design. The Devil Wears Prada is probably a movie that more women will see than men, but in the long run I really liked this film. The acting is great and Meryl Streep who plays Miranda will undoubtedly get an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and Stanley Tucci who plays Nigel will likely get a Best Supporting Actor nomination as well. Meryl Streep uses her face, movements and body language to play this character and she does a great job of it. The film is also very entertaining and has a very sharp and well written script. There are a lot of intellect inside jokes in this movie and some of the dialog between the magazine co-workers is sassy and smartly written. The film is compelling and in a lot of ways this is a very pleasant film with a likable young woman who has to decide about her future and her family and friends at the same time. This movie entertained me and kept my interest and it has a well polished directing job and great performances that will not go unnoticed come awards time, so basically in every way this movie is a hit. And even though this movie looks like a mere chick flick I think it would be a really good date movie and that guys will enjoy the film and the acting as well. The Devil Wears Prada is one of the first great comedies of the year and starts off the summer as one of the best film's so far this year. A huge success of a film.",10,1,2,6 July 2006
Corpse Bride," Corpse Bride
","Corpse Bride, is set in the early nineteenth century and is about a shy and timid young man named Victor Van Dort, who is being arranged to marry a young woman named Victoria Everglot. While they are rehearsing the wedding Victor, can't seem to get his vows right so he heads off into the woods and practices placing the wedding ring on a bony finger sticking out of the ground. To Victor's astonishment out comes a living corpse who now thinks that Victor and her are married. The corpse bride takes Victor, to live with her down under but Victor, wants to go back and marry Victoria, but at the same time he is in a bit of a situation because he also accidentally married the corpse bride. Winner of The Future Film Festival Digital Award for the film's directors Mike Johnson and Tim Burton at The Venice Film Festival. Corpse Bride, is a great looking film and I really liked the stop motion animation they did for the film. The film is also stylish and very neat to look at, is entertaining, creative, charming, very inventive and it plays out like a fairy tale with a lot of macabre humour but is appropriate enough for younger viewers. Corpse Bride, sometimes looks and feels like The Nightmare Before Christmas, because of similar animation, style and music but on it's own this is still a good film which is visually fascinating and has a sweet story that I think will appeal to those both young and old. I have been a big fan of Tim Burton's for a long time and I think there is a very good chance that this film will be nominated at next year's Oscars for Best Animated Film, and I think it has a very good chance of winning because although I haven't seen any of the other animated films that have come out this year so far, this one has been the highest rated so I'd say it has really good chances and I would personally for one really like to see Tim Burton win an Oscar.",8,2,4,24 September 2005
American Hustle," American Hustle
","I was lucky enough to be able to see American Hustle, twice in theatres and each viewing made me like and appreciate the film even more. Because there is often so much going on in this film, I feel that most people would probably do better with a second viewing as I did, as I understood things better, picked up on more things and also appreciated the sense of humour the film has as well as ultimately enjoying it a lot more than on my first viewing. I still liked the film the first time I saw it, but after a second viewing I can safely say that it was one of my favourite films of 2013. In the wrong hands this film could have been your average Hollywood type grifter and con man film, but talent like David O. Russell and his amazing cast make it ever so much more than that. The original screenplay by O. Russell and Eric Singer is brilliant. I loved the way it combined the crime elements of the story as well as the drama and some of the most delectably offbeat humour, some of the best I have seen in awhile and I smiled and laughed out loud many times during the film. It's one of the more original and unique films of this year and that is one of the reasons I liked it so much. Here is a film where you have some very strong components that all seem to work to perfection. You have great acting from the main cast right down to the supporting characters. They are all great in their roles here and with a lot of these characters they have been given a couple of more dimensions than your usual Hollywood characters, so there is more to them than you may think and after the film is over and you have thought about it for awhile, you really start to appreciate everything this cast and crew did with these characters because they are so interesting, offbeat and sometimes charming at the same time. Once you piece the entire film together after you have seen it, it really makes you appreciate everything that went into it with the great writing, cast and directing. I love when you have a film such as this where the writing is so sharp and you have an excellent team of actors knocking their performances out of the ball park and delivering top notch material to already top notch writing. It is often a joy to watch. I enjoyed the 1970's setting of the film with the interior and exterior shots of buildings, the flashy clothes the characters wear and the selection of pop and rock songs that were popular at that time, which play in the film's background. All of it helped enhance the mood and made you believe that either it was the 70's, or you were watching a film from that time. I also really liked the stylish nature of the film's cinematography and direction. There were a number of camera shots and editing that I really enjoyed and found both interesting in a visual kind of way, but it also gave the film style and it's own unique way of getting this story across. I personally feel that director David O. Russell, is on a hot streak. I really enjoyed I Heart Huckabees, when I saw it back in 2004 and I loved The Fighter and readers of my reviews will know that Silver Linings Playbook, was one of my top 3 films of last year. This is a guy who can tell an excellent story and gets the best possible acting out of his actors. Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar last year for Silver Linings Playbook, and I have no doubt that she will be nominated for her performance this year in American Hustle. All the performances in this are awards worthy, it has just been an impressive year and Lawrence, is so far the only for sure lock as far as awards nominations go, but the whole cast is absolutely fantastic here. At one point I read that David O. Russell, was considering doing a biopic of cult director Russ Meyer, but I have not seen, or heard any more about that project. Seeing what he could do here with his humour and take on the 1970's, I would personally love to see that film get made, being a personal fan of Russ Meyer and now of David O. Russell as well. I am sure however that whatever his next film is, that it will be a hit because he seems to be on a hot streak with no signs of slowing down. As it stands, American Hustle is one of the most original and fun films of 2013 and I recommend if you have a chance to see it more than once as I did, because you'll appreciate it even more and I think that is the way the film was meant to be seen.",10,4,8,6 January 2014
Incendies," Incendies
","Incendies is based on the play by Wajdi Mouawad. The film is a Canadian film in French and Arabic with English subtitles. Going into the theatre to see Incendies, I really knew nothing about it. I had not read any of the reviews that came out, but I had heard from the television news shows that it was supposed to be very good and now with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, I assumed that it was going to be a really good film. I decided not to read anything about the plot before I saw the film because these days I find that so many critics gave away too much crucial information of the films in their reviews that when you finally do see the film it does not have the same affect on you. So having known nothing about Incendies and then watching the story unfold before my eyes was quite an experience and I would recommend you do the same if you are at all inclined to go see it. Other than the film's director Denis Villeneuve, I was not familiar with anybody else who appeared in the film, or worked on the sides, but I must say that they all did a fantastic job. This is the type of film that when you are watching it, you are not quite sure what will happen, or how the climax, or the ending will come, but when it does, it makes sense to you and leaves you with a multitude of feelings. At times Incendies was not always the most easy film to watch, not because it was overly violent, or graphic because I thought everything was handled in a very tastefully done way, but it still sucks so much emotion out of us and we get to care so much for the characters and what they are going through as we watch it before our eyes, that we can not help but feel sad, enraged, or even physically ill watching it at times. I should clarify that the film does deal with some of the goings on with the Middle East and the wars, tension and prejudices that came out of some of those wars and moments of terror that people at that time and still are going through. I also liked how when dealing with such a tricky and controversial subject matter such as this that as I mentioned it was all very tastefully done and none of it felt like you were watching a Hollywood movie. I think if this had been a big budget, big name star movie extravaganza, then it probably would not have worked. The reason it works so well as it is, is because the fact that it is so character driven and deals with events that have gone on in the past and in some similar and different ways are still going on today. The film felt personal to me. It felt like the people involved with the film had something to say and instead of sugar coating everything and making it an easily watchable film with a feel good portion of it, it instead goes for all your emotions and in a sense almost takes you on the journey and the personal trials and tribulations that the characters in the movie have gone on and understandably we can almost feel their pain, exhaustion and hurt because the performances have this sense of believability and authenticity to them, that everything we see them go through feels like the real thing and the way they handle each situation is believable and not far fetched at all. The characters in the film give us something to believe in because they are searching for the truth and will go to many lengths to find it, even if at times it is difficult, or even dangerous and the amount of honour and pride they carry with them to set out someone's wishes is truly remarkable. This is an incredibly powerful film that as I mentioned, does put you through an array of different emotions, but I did not mind that because I felt I could connect with the characters more because of this. The look and feel of the film is not big budget or fake looking, which makes all the interior and exterior shots look real and further enhancing the emotions, or moods we are supposed to feel in each scene. The acting by everyone involved is all terrific here as well and this is just a really well put together film with a great cast and director and wonderful material to work and mold into this brave, haunting and yet life changing experience. I have not seen any of the other Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominees, but having just seen Incendies now, I would say that it has a good chance of winning because of how masterful and great it is. Do not just take my word for it, go and see it when it opens in a theatre near you. This is certainly one of the best films of 2010.",10,29,56,10 February 2011
Nightcrawler," Nightcrawler
","Over the last several months after premiering at what I believe was The Toronto Film Festival, and/or various other festivals, I had been hearing a lot of good feedback about Nightcrawler. Critics seemed to love it as did the audience members who had a chance to see early screenings of it. When the film was given a wide release and all major critics reviewed it, it got very impressive reviews with some calling it one of the year's best films. While, I did like the film and found a lot to admire about it, I still did not love it and would not go as far as to call it a masterpiece, or even one of the best films of the year. Jake Gyllenhaal went to great lengths for the character he portrays here by losing a lot of body weight and muscle tone as well as the fact that his character seems to be on an adrenaline, or caffeine rush because he always seems ready and raring to go for everything and he hardly ever blinks his eyes and can go on long detailed conversations with a lot of big jargoned words and very detailed sentences. For the first half hour, or so of the film I found his character actually really irritating and I found he was getting on my nerves and I could not imagine watching a character like this for a whole two hour movie. Luckily for me, I soon started to grasp the point and the various ticks and mannerisms of his character and what felt like perhaps a forced, irritating, or over the top performance at first, I soon started to appreciate the great lengths he went to, to portray a character as nuanced and hard to pinpoint in exact words. The story and film itself is quite a disturbing and very unsettling one that did disturb me and gave me an unpleasant feeling while watching it, but I wont hold that against the film because I think that that is one of the feelings the viewer is supposed to feel during and after the film. The film is a social commentary and is in some ways a satire, but I personally didn't find anything to laugh out loud about, but I did appreciate it's social commentary about the desensitization of people today and their lack of empathy, or feeling towards others and just violent and despicable deeds in general. Also, I found it interesting and appropriate how it showed just how desperate television stations are to broadcast something shocking, sensational, graphic and just plain disturbing to capture the viewer's attention, not because they are great, dedicated, or even talented journalists, or broadcasters, but for the single fact that violence, sex and anything shocking, or cringe worthy will always draw viewers whether it is a good, or negative response and that equals viewers and money for them and the station they work for. All this satire and commentary I appreciated greatly and found it both to be insightful and a good commentary and sociological commentary of us and our times. The film primarily takes place at night time and has some of the best cinematography I have seen so far this year. With the lights of the homes and businesses lit up in downtown Los Angeles, it gave the film the perfect look it needed while being visually pleasing as well. I thought the supporting performances from Rene Russo (who I haven't seen in anything for a long time) as well as Riz Ahmed, were also very good as well here. The music was atmospheric and suited the tone and mood of the film perfectly while the editing which at some points was slow and yet other times was extremely fast paced was excellently done as well. I think one of my few flaws with the film was at times it did feel a bit cold and perhaps a bit too nihilistic, or isolationist for my taste. I can get why the filmmakers decided to go that route and while it certainly does suit the film, I just really found it hard to really have much connection to the film, or these characters. I guess it did affect me in some pretty powerful ways in certain aspects because I left the film feeling jolted with feelings of unsettledness and was quite disturbed by what I had seen as I mentioned earlier. It did have a profound affect on me that way, so in that regard the filmmakers did a very good job. This was the first directorial effort of writer/director Dan Gilroy, and I must say it was an impressive one and while the film did not win me over completely, I still found a lot to admire about it and I see a promising career ahead for Mr. Gilroy and I think Jake Gyllenhaal will continue also to do good work and having a good career as well.",9,1,4,10 November 2014
The Aviator," The Aviator
","The Aviator, is based on the true life story of Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes, was very eccentric and he directed such films as Hell's Angels and Scarface. Howard, had a lot of money so he founded his own aircraft company where he would design and build aircrafts. He even broke a couple of speed records with some of his aircrafts. Howard, also dated a lot of women including actress Katharine Hepburn, and later in his life he lived mostly in a hotel room running his business from there. The Aviator, has good direction, a good script, good performances by everyone involved (especially Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Howard Hughes), good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration and good costume design. The film is made by director Martin Scorsese, who I like very much as a filmmaker but I wasn't very impressed with his last film Gangs Of New York. Martin Scorsese, makes up for that film with this one. The Aviator, is entertaining, well made, is very good visually, is interesting, compelling, Leonardo DiCaprio gives an Oscar worth performance, the film is enthralling, the film is stylish, a good character study, gives us another Oscar worthy performance by Cate Blanchett who plays Katharine Hepburn and is just a very compelling and excellently made film from it's acting down to it's in detail production design. I would have liked to have known a little bit more facts about Howard Hughes, and his life but that is only a small complaint and I was very pleased with the rest of this film. A great film and one of the year's best.",8,1,2,7 February 2005
Burn After Reading," Burn After Reading
","Burn After Reading is a darker comedy about several very interesting individuals who all cross paths with each other, which is not necessarily a good thing at all. We have a CIA agent who has just been fired and decides to write his lifelong memoirs, the ex CIA agent's wife who is having an affair with a womanizing playboy who is also having an affair with other women that do not include his wife and we have two dimwitted fitness trainers at a workout gym who one is pretty brain dead while the other who isn't very smart either, hatches a plan in order to raise several thousands of dollars to pay for numerous plastic surgery operations that she thinks she needs. Throw in some paranoia, the Russian embassy and the CIA and you have a lot of weird things going on. Pretty much all of the main characters I have listed for you in this film are very into themselves and in a sense they are all pretty nihilistic and with no morals or anything righteous about them. The only really kind, or nice character in it is a supporting character who works at the fitness gym. Having said that, I think that the characters are all the more interesting because of this. Burn After Reading is a very quirky comedy and I admit that within the first 15 to 20 minutes of the film, I was not really sure what would be happening, or what type of a film I had just walked into, but needless to say I liked it a lot. There have been some pretty original and unique films this year so far and I would add this one to the list as well. Everything is so over the top and unusual that I think it is hard not to acknowledge what an original piece of work this is. The actors all do a great job of playing their characters and I think that they really hold the film together because if it wasn't for this great acting ensemble, I don't think the film could have been pulled off as well as it did. Also the original script and direction makes for very entertaining viewing and this is definitely a very interesting watch. I myself am a fan of darker comedies and this one has elements of very juvenile almost ludicrous elements of comedy, yet at the same time it is also done with great writing skill and the darker elements thrown in also add a lot of neat twists, turns and surprises that for me at least, were very enjoyable and to say the least, unique. I admit that the advertisements of this film do make it look very stupid and the film deals with a lot of stupid people, but the material is razor sharp and once you watch it you will realize just how many brainy ideas and thoughts went into this film. Burn After Reading is certainly not going to be a good time for everyone, but those who enjoy the writer/director team's other efforts, should know what they are getting into and hopefully you will have an enjoyable a time as I did.",10,1,6,21 September 2008

","28 Weeks Later is a sequel to the film 28 Days Later and follows the previous film several weeks later (as the title suggests). The film takes place in Britain where the army has helped keep an area of town safe where the survivors can stay and everything seems fine until the virus that infected everyone from the first film is back infecting people and a young brother and sister along with a woman from the army are on the run from the infected and trying to make it to a place where they will be safe, but unfortunately for them the virus is spreading quickly and they don't have long to run and hide from the carriers of the disease. Back in 2003 before I saw 28 Days Later, I found the screenplay at my local bookstore, so I sat down and read it. This also lead to a fellow book enthusiast sitting beside me telling me for some reason that he believes that zombies actually exist, but that is another story. Anyways, I was quite impressed with the screenplay of 28 Days Later, so I saw it in theatres shortly after and was impressed by the film as well. When, I heard that a sequel was being made and the original writer and director were only involved as producers, I wasn't so sure if it would turn out well or not, but after having just seen the film I must conclude that this new director and writer pulled it off, and quite well I may add. The film took a little different approach then the first installment whereas this version has a lot more action and things happening where the first film had a more slow approach and built up the action and suspense as it went along, but this film started with non stop action right within the first ten minutes. This isn't to say that the first film's approach was bad in anyway because it wasn't, it was just kind of nice to see it done in a different kind of style and pace. The non stop action and the very fast editing worked for me and kept me quite entertained and the movie held it's own while remaining stylish and delivering thrills and gore as well. There were also more dramatic scenes in the film and times where there was no action and things were being explained and it got to show what was going on with the city and the characters a little bit, but those scenes were well done and worked as well. The manic energy and pace of this film captured my attention and interest right from the start and with it's stylish direction, good editing and just fast action and happenings I really had a good time with this film. The horror scenes worked well as did the action scenes and from a technical point the film was well made and as a rule any horror fan can tell you that most sequels do not work (and this does not just apply to the horror category either), but this film worked on every level from story to direction to just having a good time and like I mentioned earlier I liked how it had some of the same qualities I liked about the first film, but I also liked how it took some new approaches as well. This is one of the better horror films and sequels of recent years and if done properly I could see how a third installment in the series could work as well, but for now this one is better than okay and for a film of this kind it really is very good.",9,7,16,12 May 2007
The Revenant," The Revenant
","The Revenant, was a film that with it's style and the way it was done certainly reminded me of films and directors of past and present, but overall it was a film experience that I will probably remember for quite some time. The film is supposedly based on a true story which is not necessarily a bad thing at all, but when you watch this film and see all that the characters go through, I think you will also be absolutely amazed that people could have actually gone through and lived like this and even survived some of these circumstances and situations. The film is so life like with it's makeup and set locations to it's wonderfully real and yet beautiful and almost mystical cinematography that we believe everything that is going on before us and the film affects us that more deeply because of how realistic and life like everything is. The film with it's filmmaking style as others have said, reminded me a fair bit of the grand epics of Stanley Kubrick like 2001: A Space Odyssey, or even The Shining at times and then you have some dreamlike sequences and shots that really compliment nature and the outdoors and really make it an important part of this film and some of those shots and dreamlike scenes reminded me of the work of Terrence Malick, and how nature and just beauty even when found in tragic situations and circumstances is always there and how nature and the outdoors is really a huge part of us and some of those particular sequences are beautiful to watch and Malick always used the world's best cinematographers and here Emmanuel Lubezki does the wonderful and is sure to win an Oscar for the film and what is further interesting is that Lubezki has also worked with Malick, on such films as the upcoming Knight of Cups, To the Wonder and Tree of Life. The film also at times reminded me in style of Paul Thomas Anderson's grand epic, There Will Be Blood and again that was not surprising because the production design was by the great Jack Fisk, who worked on There Will Be Blood as well as working with Malick on Knight of Cups, To the Wonder, The Thin Red Line, Days of Heaven and Badlands (some of those films he was the production designer and others the art director), so I think you can see where and why I base these connections. The Revenant, is certainly an experience and an assault on your senses and I mean that in the best way possible. Everything from the visuals which include wonderful cinematography to the haunting and yet thrilling musical score to just being one in the barren wilderness all brings together a feast and visual stimulation for your eyes, ears and every part of your body. It certainly is a film to see and behold. The story to the film is a fascinating one and that does really make you want to see where and what it will do next. The film is longer in length and for the most part does a really good job of handling a longer running time. I also liked the whole aspect of man versus man, man versus nature and even man versus animals that was incorporated into this story and yet again transports us to the wilderness and how these men were living and shows that you don't need a modern setting, or technology to make a film truly interesting, thrilling, or action packed because in this period piece film everything it needs for such a thrilling film is all right on display at it's disposal and with the exception of one scene in particular, the special effects are kept at a low level and natural effects such as make up and real environments are used instead and I found that it looks and gives us a more genuine feel and overall experience with the film that makes it feel more real. Leonardo DiCaprio who plays the lead character here does go through the unthinkable and just how he has the determination and strength to keep pressing on and ultimately trying to right a grievous wrong is fascinating to watch. DiCaprio put his body through what must have been a really intense and gruelling film shoot that looks like it was probably the most difficult film he has ever acted in. The results are great however as he gives us one of last year's best performances and will be sure to win an Oscar for his performance. This is a film not only about survival, but also about what really drives us in life and what we set forth as our missions and goals in life and how we set out to seek them no matter how tough it may seem. How the film also incorporates the native people into this story and giving them interesting roles that were not just stereotypes was another interesting aspect I also liked about the film. This is certainly a film with it's beautiful and mystical look will amaze you yet with it's brutality and honest and realistic depiction of these circumstances and settings makes The Revenant a film you will not soon forget which is the best compliment I can give the film and I truly do mean it.",9,0,2,7 February 2016
Bridge of Spies," Bridge of Spies
","Bridge of Spies, the new Steven Spielberg directed film about an American lawyer who is asked to defend a man accused of being a Soviet spy during the Cold War, reminds me of the type of films that James Stewart would have starred in back in the 40's and 50's. It especially brings to mind some of his collaborations with director Frank Capra. All these films took place at a similar time and deep down Bridge of Spies both has the nostalgic qualities of those early movies as well as it proudly an American picture and represents it's country with dignity and respect, but also ingrained into the film is a message about loyalty, honour and humanism. Tom Hanks, plays the James Stewart type character in this film and he is a loving family man and cares deeply not only about his family, but his country and doing the right thing as well. When he is asked to defend Rudolf Abel, the man convicted of being a Soviet spy, Hanks' character James B. Donovan, doesn't really have to think about it for too long. He knows that defending such a man as Rudolf, especially during the Cold War, is a risky move and one that is bound to raise many an eyebrow of his friends and neighbors, but also could bring some repercussions upon him and even his family. Donovan accepts the job though because he is under the impression and belief that everyone is entitled to a fair trial and that Rudolf also deserves his share of justice and having been defended whether he really is guilty, or not. A character who puts others first instead of himself is one of the attributes that reminds me of a lot of the loyal and truly honorable American characters that James Stewart used to play. Take, It's A Wonderful Life for example. Stewart's character George Bailey does so much for the town in which he lives as well as everyone living in it that he has always put his own dreams and desires on the backburner to see to it that there was a fair lending system in his city and people were not controlled by the evil, Mr. Potter, who more, or less tries to take over the town and the town people's money. James B. Donovan, is another one of those characters who absolutely is proud and loves his country and while what he is doing may be called 'un American' by some of those around him, he strongly believes that giving Abel, a fair trial and representing him is everything that America stands for. Including true democracy and freedom of speech and the right to be defended in a court of law. Another honorable film character it brings to mind is Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird. We have seen these type of heroes and films before and yet there is something that keeps bringing us back to them. I would be a liar if I said there has been a single Christmas is the last ten to fifteen years when I haven't watched It's A Wonderful Life and have been completely wowed and deeply moved by it on every single occasion I watch it (which does turn out to be every year). These are the type of films that were shown after the Great Depression, or during, or after the Second World War because these types of films were definitely morale boosters and in a sense (especially back then), that is why they were made in the first place. I have read some complaints about Bridge of Spies and this certain World War 2 era nostalgia and type of acting. I have read complaints calling the acting in the film hokey and more melodramatic, which is something I can understand a lot of people who would watch a modern day film would have a problem with. I admit myself that in my journey through all sorts of different films from different years and decades, that I used to have a problem with American films made in the 40's, or 50's because of the melodramatic acting style. And yet, I could have easily watched a European film from that same time period and have had no qualms, or issues with the acting whatsoever. While, I admit that melodramatic acting is still not one of my favorites (whether it was done back then, or currently), I have learned to accept it and look at it more as a sign of the times back then more than anything else. I think that is also how you have to look at Bridge of Spies because it is very faithful and accurate in recreating those times, so that acting style has to stay. It wasn't a problem for me though and look at Mark Rylance's performance as Rudolf Abel. Not melodramatic in the least, but a very fascinating and interesting character to watch that does eventually become endearing to us the viewers. This is a film that I found to be quite inspiring and moving and that is one of the strong reasons I am recommending it. The performances (keeping in mind the time period) are all very good as well and this is one of those films that is a feel good film that captures your interest and keeps you in a good mood after you have left the theatre. A real accomplishment in this day and age and one to be honored.",9,0,1,9 November 2015
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Sunshine
","Little Miss Sunshine is about a very dysfunctional family with a father named Richard whose attitude is that everyone has to win all the time, the mother Sheryl, the suicidal uncle Frank, the son who doesn't talk named Dwayne, the grandfather who speaks whatever is on his mind and a young girl named Olive who wants to be in a beauty pageant being held several states over. To not let her down the family gathers into their VW bus and travels to get to the pageant, but along the way they argue, experience all sorts of problems and learn a lot about each other. Little Miss Sunshine has good direction, a good original script and Oscar worthy performances by the main cast. It took me a little bit to get into this film, but after seeing it and thinking about it I appreciate the film even more. The film had sharp writing and there are a lot of really good conversations between the characters in this film and especially near the end of the film there is a lot of satirical humour that worked quite well I thought. I thought everyone played their parts great and after awhile you really start to like this family and it doesn't really matter that they are dysfunctional and have their own problems because in many ways I think people will be able to relate to at least somebody in the film. I also liked how at the beginning of the film everyone in the family was really wrapped up in their own lives, but because of this trip they learn more about each other and start to work together more as a family. This movie had a lot of dark and offbeat humour in it as well and I liked how it gave the film a certain edge that few comedies have. There are however still some warm hearted scenes and scenes of togetherness and bonding that I thought worked quite well too. This is a very original comedy in a lot of ways and I liked how different it is than most of the regular comedies we have been seeing lately. I think a lot of people will appreciate this film and it will become a hidden gem for most people who will give the film a chance because when I saw this film in theatres the audience really seemed to be loving it. For being original and having sharp writing and a great performance by the cast I recommend Little Miss Sunshine.",8,1,4,26 August 2006
Hugo," Hugo
","Hugo is based upon the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. The film is a period piece film, taking place in 1930's Paris, France. Fans of director Martin Scorsese may also want to note that this is his first time directing a family film and also one in 3D. The film is full of enchantment and lots to behold and wonder at, so I feel that if I was to give too much away it would spoil the film, so I suggest you look elsewhere for a plot synopsis, or even watch the film's trailer. I found a lot to like about Hugo, but there were also a few things that I had problems with as well. First the good. The film looks great. Normally, I am not a fan of films in 3D because I find that they look fake and it just feels ever so much more like you are watching a computer program, or video game and does not feel real in any way. The visual effects in Hugo are all extremely well done and they look believable and give the film a great look. Every so often a character's face may look a bit askew when trying to capture it with the 3D background, but that does not happen too often and for the most part it looks great. The whole film looks great from it's visual effects, costumes, set decorations, make up and cinematography. It's a wonderfully authentic and dazzling piece of eye candy that also looks and feels of 1930's Paris, France and has all the charm and beauty of the city as well. The acting here is all very good from everybody. The whole cast is very talented and they all do a great job in their individual roles. The adults are good and the kids do a great job here as well. The story to the film is very original and for me I was quite intrigued as to how and where the film would go and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a little bit of everything from fantasy, mystery, comedy, science fiction and is even an open love letter to a certain art form that if you see the film you will know what I mean and I think that reason alone is why film lover Martin Scorsese made the film in the first place. The film enchants with it's visuals, keeps us interested with it's adventuresome and likable characters and the different magical and mysterious things going on. The film is marketed as a family film, but I can definitely see adults appreciating the film more than children, but older children may find something here to like as well. Now on to the few things I had a problem with during the film. I thoroughly enjoyed myself during the duration of the film, but there were times when the film did feel a bit long. It's not an overly long movie at two hours and seven minutes, but there are certain scenes that do drag on a bit and after the film is over it somehow feels like the film was much longer than the running time I just provided you with, even though it is not. Also, I did like all of the characters in the film, but I felt that there were too many subplots going on during the film that took away from the main story. It's not that they were not interesting, but they didn't have all that much to do with the central theme, or message of the story and ultimately just made the film longer and this is in parts where it began to drag, so I would have to say some of the additional stories were a little unnecessary. Had they been trimmed down, or edited a bit, or maybe found a different way to incorporate them into the film it could have worked, but as it is they don't. Those are probably my only problems with the film and while I still liked it a fair bit and admired a lot about it, I can not honestly say that it is a great film, or one of the year's best. Still there is a lot here that I think movie lovers will admire and get a lot out of, so I still recommend Hugo and it is a nice feel good film, especially appropriate now in time for the holidays, so I would still recommend it, but for me it had enough flaws to prevent it from being a masterpiece, but it is still definitely worth seeing even if you have to pay a little extra for the accompanying 3D glasses.",7,6,8,28 November 2011
Silver Linings Playbook," Silver Linings Playbook
","Over the past several years we seem to have several romantic comedies coming out each year. Most of them do not interest me one bit and I stay away from them. I am sure you know which ones I mean. The ones that are predictable and despite all odds a handsome leading man ends up with his beautiful female leading lady and the chemistry does not feel real and it all feels so contrived and clich√©d and it's one of those situations where if you have seen one of them, you have seen them all. Thankfully, Silver Linings Playbook is an exception to that rule. It is a film that is more, or less a romantic comedy, but also deals with mental illness and real people and their feelings. The film at times would indeed make me laugh, but at other times I sat in quiet amazement over the wonderful performances that were on display here from the whole cast and also the top notch writing that brings us deeper into these characters and provides for much entertainment and brilliant dialogue. I know some people were a little concerned about having a film where the two main characters have both suffered from and still do to an extent, mental health issues. However, I did not find that the film put that element in there to mock, or single out these characters, but instead to show a different perspective on every day life and in this case different views on love and relationships as well. When you are first watching Silver Linings Playbook, for the first half hour, or so, you really do not know which way this film is going to go, or what type of a film that it will be, but I was pleasantly surprised on all accounts. Both stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are terrific in this. I have only seen Bradley Cooper in The Hangover, before this and while it was humorous and entertaining, I think we all have to admit that it is not an awards calibre movie. Bradley Cooper shines in this role and gives us so much to walk away from the film thinking about as does Jennifer Lawrence as well. This is the first film I have seen Jennifer Lawrence in and she was also terrific. There is a certain element of mystery and a sense of uncertainty about her character as you watch the film. She seems to have put up barricades around herself, probably to protect her, but as the film goes along and she lets down those walls and you get to see more of her character and look past her insecurities and neuroses, you really do start cheering for her and hoping it will all work out for her as well as Bradley Cooper's character as well. It has been awhile where I have seen a comedy drama with such well layered and developed characters as they are here. They felt real to me and because of that, I could often identify with them, feel for them and feel a certain connection to them. Every minute of screen time they had, I just wanted to continue to watch them over sheer fascination of these characters and because of how well written and how well played they were. Supporting actors Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver do a great job here as well and to be perfectly honest about it, I think this is one of De Niro's strongest films and performances in years. Silver Linings Playbook often brought a smile to my face, gave me something to think about and at times almost brought tears to my eyes because of the sheer simplicity of it's characters and the beautiful relationships they have developed with one another and how they just don't give up when things get tough, or throw in the towel, so to speak, but they actually go and want to better themselves and improve their lives and get over the stigma and stereotypes of mental illness and prove that they can make it on their own and achieve what they want to achieve. This film was really special for me. It made me laugh, almost cry, allowed me to identify with the characters and lifted my mood watching the film. It put me in such a good mood that I wanted to stand up and cheer after the film was over. What a monumental piece of filmmaking where everything seemed to have gone perfectly. This alongside with The Master, are my favourite films to date of 2012. I see big things ahead for Lawrence and Cooper and David O. Russell is proving what a great screenwriter and director he is after this and The Fighter. Congruatulations to you all, you were all fantastic and did a great job.",10,3,6,20 January 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is based upon the novel of the same name by Stieg Larsson and was previously made into a film in 2009 starring Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace and directed by Niels Arden Oplev. This American version of the book (the other version I mentioned was Swedish), stars Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara and is directed by David Fincher. First off I would like to say that I have never read the book of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, or seen the Swedish adaptation either. I know that a couple of years ago the book became immensely popular among avid readers and that two sequels were released with the books and shortly after with the three films done in Sweden and now we have the American version of the first book and film. So having never read the book or having seen the Swedish version, I am going into this film as a newcomer unfamiliar with all of it. When the film first started playing a cover version of Led Zeppelin's The Immigrant Song, to some poorly conceived opening credits, I really had no idea whether I would like this film, or not, and to be honest it did take me a little while to get into it and used to the style of the whole thing, but once I adjusted and got used to the characters and what was going on in the film, I found myself totally enthralled with it and absolutely loving it. The film will definitely not be for everyone because it is very dark and macabre and features some very graphic violence, which I am sure will turn some viewers off. That being said I found the film to be absolutely fascinating. I am not going to give away any of the plot, because many of you going to see it I am sure will have been familiar with either the book, or should I say books, or films. If you have never seen any of them like myself, you will be so captivated by what is going on, you will need no previous knowledge of the films, or books in which to enjoy it. I thought the acting here by the entire cast was absolutely fantastic. Each person did the best job they possibly could and in a film like this, that means taking many risks and even doing a lot of quite physical and demanding work and they all did a terrific job. If the Oscars gave an award for best overall cast in a movie, this should certainly be one of the nominees. The actors each had their own personality to the characters and further enhanced what made them intriguing, different, or even evil. I must also give huge credit to the novelist Stieg Larsson and screenwriter Steve Zaillian, because both have created characters here that are so multi dimensional and they have so many different sides to them that we are not only intrigued and fascinated by them, but we also want to learn even more about them and because of the strong characterization and development we feel for these characters whether it be pity, empathy, or downright fear. I also liked how the characters evolved as the film went on and they were not just the typecast characters that I thought they would be. The film is a mystery and there is so much going on in this film, but it all plays out so well that none of it is boring, or feels useless and the way they crafted and put everything together like this was absolutely brilliant. The musical score as well as the lighting, cinematography and direction further gave depth and feeling to the mood of the film and at types we would feel really fearful, or in a state of suspense, or other times shocked, or even intrigued by what we had just watched. This is a dark and macabre little movie and like I said, it would definitely not be for everyone, but I credit the filmmakers for going with it and not shying away from anything and just producing a sometimes hard to watch, but overall fascinating and mysterious masterpiece. Everything about this film is so masterfully constructed, I think as lot of major film buffs would find it hard not to love, or find a lot to like about this film. The film's director David Fincher directed 2010's The Social Network, which I considered to be the absolute best film of that year and here again he impressed me very much and made what I consider to be the best film of 2011. This guy is definitely going places and has the talent and resume to prove it. This is a hands down masterpiece.",10,2,7,8 January 2012
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," The 40 Year Old Virgin
","The 40 Year Old Virgin, is about Andy Stitzer, a forty year old man who works in an electronic store and doesn't have much of a social life and is very awkward around women. Some of his co-workers at the store invite him out one night and they discover that Andy, is still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity. One day in the store Andy, meets a woman named Trish, who gives him her phone number and eventually Andy, works up enough courage to go on a date with her and they start to really like each other but Andy, is still very awkward when it comes to sex and he is going to have to tell this to Trish, much to his embarrassment if he can actually get up enough courage to tell her before things get awkward. The 40 Year Old Virgin, has good direction, a good script, good comedic performances by the whole cast, good cinematography and good film editing. The film stars and is co-written by Steve Carell, who does a very good comedic breakthrough performance and his writing for the film is very good too. I was very pleasantly surprised with this film. It is sweet, funny, entertaining, fun, enjoyable, clever, good natured and a good time. This film is just as good as this year's Wedding Crashers, and both films are two of the best comedies I have seen in awhile. The 40 Year Old Virgin, really showcases a lot of talent and it is put to good use and it works as a comedy and a romance and it is sweet and a lot of fun. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.",8,4,8,23 August 2005
The Men Who Stare at Goats," The Men Who Stare At Goats
","The Men Who Stare At Goats is based upon the book of the same name by Jon Ronson. At times the film claims to have parts that are based on a true story, but I think each individual who watches the film will come out of it with a firm opinion on that matter, whether they think it could possibly be true, or the complete and total opposite. I am sure anyone who is interested in the film, or is at least curious about it, has probably seen the film's trailer, or has read movie reviews on it. For that reason I really do not want to talk about the plot of the film because I really do not want to give anything else away that may have already been shown, or talked about in other reviews, or the film's trailer. That being said I was not entirely sure what type of film this would be, or what kind of lasting effect it would have on me, but overall I was pretty satisfied. I definitely have to give the cast and crew credit for making a film like this because it is so bizarre and in many ways brilliantly unique and I am sure that there are enough studios and actors and directors who would pass up this material for that reason, so I definitely admire this cast and crew for going ahead and making a movie like this. Other than being really impressed by the film's unique story (if you can call it that in loose terms), or just by it's style and direction, I also found it to be quite captivating and there were definitely a lot of laugh out loud moments during it and it is definitely not a boring film and again whether you decide what you are watching is true, or the strangest and most unbelievable thing that you have ever heard, or in this case seen, I still guarantee that you will be interested and want to see where the director goes with it. The comedic performances here are all right on target and well done. They do justice to the material as does the director, screenwriter and the music set to the film really emphasizes it's style and the era and state of mind that it is trying to get across. In other words it is well done. At times the film is very ridiculous and as far out there as you can possibly get, but like I said earlier, it is very interesting and makes for quite an entertaining watch. I again applaud the individuals who brought this to the screen, because they have done a film like no other and for that reason alone The Men Who Stare At Goats is worth seeing at least once because it is quite different from any other film this year and stands on it's own for originality and ludicrous humour. Recommended for at least one watch and for those who are curious about it.",9,4,8,8 November 2009
Jarhead," Jarhead
","Jarhead, is based on the book of the same name by Anthony Swofford. The film tells about Anthony's experience as a young man as he was a lance corporal in the United States Marine Corps. He was in the scout/sniper position and was in Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait during the Gulf War. The film shows Anthony's relationship with the other Marines and the sergeants and what they do while they are stationed out there and what they do before they can finally come home. Jarhead, has good direction, a good script, great performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The film is well made in just about every possible way and it is a very engrossing and compelling film. The film has some very powerful moments, is bold and one of the strongest things about the film are it's characters. The film focuses on several different characters through the film and I found that the characters were all very interesting and we got to get some personality traits here and they were all well played by the actors. Jake Gyllenhall, who plays Anthony Swofford, does a very good job of playing his character through different emotions and situations and one this film's strongest points is it's different characters. The film is about a war but there is no real combat or fighting scenes in this film. Instead of that it's how these characters react to the war, the training and each other. I found this to be more interesting and powerful than if it had long epic battles in the movie. This reminded me of the film The Deer Hunter, because in that film it shows more about the characters than the war also. The other thing that is really good about this movie is it's look and feel from it's great director Sam Mendes. I immediately knew Sam Mendes, would be a great director after I first saw American Beauty, in 1999. It was one of my favourite films of that year and it left quite an impact on me. I then saw his second film Road To Perdition, which I did not like as much as American Beauty, but I thought it was great too. Now, Sam Mendes comes to us with Jarhead, and it is quite a great achievement and I think after only three films so far in his career that he will win many more awards and he is on the path to becoming one of today's best directors. I think some may be disappointed in Jarhead, for not being more faster paced or having the battle scenes but for a powerful film about characters and how they react to war and these situations this is a film for you.",8,3,5,6 November 2005
Inside Out," Inside Out
","For me, modern day animated films can be a tough sell. I love animation and have since I was a child. I grew up watching a lot of the Walt Disney cartoons that kids today still watch and love. As, I grew older I got interested in more adult oriented animated films such as the work of Ralph Bakshi, Bill Plympton and films such as Gerald Potterton's Heavy Metal. I also found as I grew up that I was not really all that interested in 3D animation which really seemed to be taking off. To me it looked like you were staring at a computer program, or game and I felt it lacked emotion and a lot of the story relied on the new age type of effects and techniques the animators could now use with these computer programs and techniques. I also found the writing of the films got lazier and it just overall did not win me over at all. There were some good exceptions within the last 15 years, or so of some really good animated films such as Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away as well as Sylvain Chomet's The Triplets of Belleville. Such beautifully animated and extremely creative and well written animated films like these were unfortunately becoming a rarity. A lot of the stuff Disney and it's collaboration with Pixar, was unfortunately not working for me all that much either as I found that they often had a hard time of balancing whether to make a film that worked for both adults and kids and I sometimes found that as above mentioned, that I had problems with the 3D animation and the writing relied too heavily on this new technology and effects. There were a few exceptions, but to me something like the Shrek films (I know these are Dreamworks films and not Pixar) and films of that kind which were heavily praised and adored, were to me extremely overrated. Thankfully now with Inside Out, we are getting back to a type of animated film that has animation I like as well as a great story, creativity and will definitely work for both the adult and child audiences going to see the film. This film takes a premise of something that I think we can all relate to and makes a fascinating and very creative movie out of it, that also turns out to be a lot of fun. This one however, particular interested me. The whole human brain and dealing with emotions and the human psychosis has fascinated me ever since I was a child. At a time in my life, I felt like I wanted to be a therapist, or a counselor one day and human problems, emotions and various neurosis of different people fascinated and compelled me. Through the 90's I remember being a huge fan of the animated series, Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist and found the show very humorous as well as also really enjoying the dialogue between Katz and his patients and what was meant to be humorous and was, was also fascinating to me with what makes one think, or feel, or act this way. Inside Out, takes this to a whole new level by giving five of every human's basic chemistry and emotions into fully animated and into talking characters. We have Joy (each character is named after their emotion), Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. The actors who do the voice over work do a terrific job and the writers have given each a wonderfully true and yet fun and playful personality and each depicting the certain feeling that they are meant to represent. Joy (who is one of the main characters of the film) is so bubbly and just an absolute joy to watch that you get enjoyment and just feel happiness just radiating from her that she is literally a joy to watch. All the other characters each have their own priceless moments and really add to the film as well. The human characters in this story each depict average everyday people and the different emotions we go through on an everyday basis making the film easy for a viewer of any age to relate and connect to. The film is creative in both it's writing, voice over work and animation. The film takes us through many adventures and many brilliantly conceived ideas and plot devices, but also hits home once in awhile and makes us think of our own body chemistry and our own emotions at times. This is the most creative and flat our brilliant I have seen in a mainstream animated film in a long time. Inside Out works for both adults and kids and is fun, visually pleasing and has everything that should set off the perfect modern day animated film. Disney and Pixar's best in awhile.",10,7,32,11 July 2015
No Country for Old Men," No Country For Old Men
","No Country For Old Men is based upon the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. The film is about a man named Llewelyn Moss who is hunting in the desert and uncovers a crime scene of a drug deal gone wrong. In his findings he also uncovers a briefcase full of money which he takes home with him. Meanwhile a ruthless killer named Anton Chigurh who wants the money that Llewelyn stumbled upon is now after him and Llewelyn has to watch his tracks and do everything to avoid this crafty man who will stop at nothing to get the money and to kill him also. This was a film that really is an effective thriller. The plot and the different twists are all very clever and unpredictable and unless someone read a spoiler filled review of this movie, or read the book then I guarantee you will also not know which direction this film is going to go in and what is going to happen to the characters. The mood and tension is also brilliantly set up by very little dialog and noise from the main characters and in the stalking scenes the shadows, lighting and the fact that there is little to no music in those scenes further sets up a powerful and thrilling mood and keeps you captivated to see what will happen next. This is also a very good looking film and because of the way it was shot it adds to the film's look that it tries to convey with shadows, darkness and isolated places and rooms that because of the way it was filmed really helps with the atmosphere and mood of the film. When there is talking in the film the dialog is often well written and even when we just see the camera following the characters around and seeing what they do next, this is also a great character study and an examination of what one would do in a certain situation type of movie. After I left the film at the theatre, I didn't feel that everyone in the audience was totally impressed by the film, or the way it was done. I personally found a lot to appreciate with this film and even though the plot sounds generic enough, there really is a lot of intelligence and thought behind it and because of the mood and layout of the film it further enhances just what a thrilling story this is. I also liked how the film was unlike a lot of Hollywood films in a way that it didn't use clich√©s, or try to do a predictable ending, or anything like that. I also admired the film all the more for that. Even though I liked this film a lot I could definitely seeing myself liking it more and more with repeat viewings and will probably grow to like it even more over time and I think the same could be said for others, or maybe even the few who were in the audience with me who I didn't get good vibes from. This is a film that will probably grow on you each time and each time will enhance your appreciation for it.",8,2,4,1 December 2007
District 9," District 9
","District 9 is one of the most original, thought provoking and entertaining science fiction films to come out in years. It has some of your usual traits of the genre such as aliens, spaceships, a futuristic and apocalyptic setting and gadgets and futuristic weapons. Also what it does have that many recent films of the genre, or many in general do not have is a gripping story and a social commentary message that goes along with it. Never before have I seen a film with a story that shows us humans as racist and intolerant towards alien visitors to this planet of ours. The aliens are sectioned off into poor and rundown areas and are then planned to be forced out of their homes and live in a compound of small tents continually guarded and monitored by human government agents. The aliens in this film are not evil invaders come to destroy us, but instead are here to make homes and raise their families. Because the humans are so intolerant and violent toward them, they want to leave home, but do not have the capabilities of doing so. The story also focuses on the one government worker named Wikus Van De Merwe who is sent to reassign these aliens to their new homes, but is later found himself on the run from his co-workers and the government because of corrupt and evil minds working beside him. Wikus's life is completely changed upside down. The film starts off with him as a mild mannered and sweet man, but as he is forced to defend for his life we see him change radically and do what needs to be done in order to survive. The transformation by both actor Sharlto Copley and the job done by the director and screenwriter are amazing. It's true human psychology and character development at it's best and the performance by Copley is amazing and will be sure to bring him Hollywood's attention and more roles for him in the future. The first half of the film and some of the last half is also done in a documentary type of style which I found to be an interesting way to tell the story and the whole film is shot in a realistic cinema verite style which I think works perfectly here to make you feel as if you are there and to give the film a look of authenticity. You have probably read my complaints on many films that go overboard with special effects and have little to nothing of a concrete story. Here we have a brilliant screenplay and while the special effects don't play a large role on the story, they are still here and are actually well done and do not take away from the real source of interest which is the characters and the situations they are in. I never thought I would be saying this about a science fiction film, but some of it feels like a documentary on some sort of news program dealing with poverty and social issues (although this time using aliens) as well as intolerance and racism as well as having action and the futuristic aspects as well. What a genius way of getting a message across and entertaining the viewer and leaving a lot to talk about after the film. A completely engrossing, sometimes disturbing and altogether unique concept that hammers home a message that is relatable to our times and probably will be for years to come. A brilliant achievement of film-making all around and one of this year's must see films and also one of the best. If the Academy Awards went out of their usual type of selected materials for Best Picture, this one would definitely hold a strong chance of being nominated, or maybe even winning. We can at least dream.",10,1,6,17 August 2009
Mamma Mia!," Mamma Mia!
","Mamma Mia is a live action version of the Broadway musical which is set to songs from the 70's pop group Abba. The film takes place on a Greek island where a young woman named Sophie is set to be married in a few days. All her life, Sophie, has never known who her father was, so she comes upon her mother's old diary and decides to invite all the men who could possibly be her father. Throughout the next couple of days Sophie learns to think for herself and we can see the close bond between her and her mother and family who are all a little shall we say eccentric. This results in a lot of old fashioned style musical numbers and dancing and a lot of over the top yet fun characters. Much like the Abba songs featured in the film, Mamma Mia is very sugary, playful and sometimes downright silly, but it all makes for an enjoyable time at the theatre. A lot of the film's characters, the actors playing them and the plot can be ridiculously over the top and silly at times, but you can tell the cast is having a great time here and there are a lot of laughs to be had and overall this isn't a movie to be taken too seriously, it's just a fun night out and an entertaining two hour diversion that is actually a lot better than this summer's movie fare so far and how refreshing it was not to see a film that was based on a comic book, or overloaded with mediocre to bad special effects. Basically the weekend I saw Mamma Mia was also the opening weekend of The Dark Knight, and it doesn't take a nuclear physicist to figure out that The Dark Knight will be the top film at the box office, not only for this weekend, but for many weekends to come. I myself am a little tired out of all these big action superhero films and I'm still debating whether, or not to even see The Dark Knight, but for those who want something just a little different, but still fun and entertaining than I think Mamma Mia will be the film for you. Just like this year's Sex And The City movie, Mamma Mia is being thought of and bad mouthed as a film strictly for the girls with no redeeming value for the male viewers. Being a male viewer, I actually found a lot to enjoy in this big ball of fluff. The songs which I would never go out and buy or anything, are still catchy and even though all the performers are really camping it up they are still having fun and you will have fun watching them. There are a lot of visual and sly in-jokes in the film that will be sure to cause a chuckle and like any of the old traditional musicals that this film is modeled after it is basically a big vibrant and joyous film with big flashy musical numbers and a lot of hamming it up from the cast and crew. I overall had a very good time with this film and while it may not be as good as some other past musicals from this decade like Dancer In The Dark, or Hedwig And The Angry Inch, it is still a very good time to be had and for those looking for something different than The Dark Knight, I think this is a good film to try.",9,2,4,19 July 2008
Batman Begins," Batman Begins
","Batman Begins, is based upon the Batman comic books and is a prequel to the previous Batman films made. The film takes place when Bruce Wayne (Batman) is an eight year old child who lives with his rich parents in Gotham City. His father Thomas Wayne, owns the Wayne building and and tries to do good for the city. One day after leaving an opera Bruce's parents are killed by a robber and Bruce is raised by the family butler Alfred. When he gets older Bruce travels and on the way is taught martial arts and several years later returns home when he was presumed dead. Bruce gets a job working at his father's company which was left to him and he sees how the city is run with corruption and violence so he plans to use his martial arts skills for good. Bruce meets Lucius Fox, a scientist at the Wayne building who he has discovered has made several weapons and a suit which was meant for the army. Bruce takes the equipment and alters it a bit and soon becomes Batman and tries to right the wrong in Gotham City by bringing down the various evils. Batman currently has to take down a drug lord and a doctor who is releasing his toxic drug in the water supply of the city. Batman Begins, has good direction, a good script, good performances by everyone involved, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction and good set decoration. I was a big fan of Batman and Batman Returns, and I remember liking Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm and the animated Batman series as well. I however did not like Batman Forever or Batman And Robin, so I wasn't quite sure if I would like this film or not. One reason I liked Batman and Batman Returns so much was because of the dark atmosphere and setting provided by director Tim Burton for both films which was sorely missed in Batman Forever and Batman And Robin. I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised with Batman Begins. The film has a great story that at times is serious and at other times very entertaining and original. The film is also engaging, stylish, well acted and well made, is entertaining with a lot of action, it is fun and unique. Actor Christian Bale makes a good Bruce Wayne/Batman and I liked how the film's director Christopher Nolan didn't use a lot of CGI for some of the effects. The film is good looking and has a nice dark futuristic type atmosphere and the film as some good art and set decoration. Batman Begins is the first real surprise I have had with a movie in theaters this year so far. I really thought the film would just be a dumb action film that would be quickly forgotten but I was sure wrong. There is a lot more to this movie than the action and it is very thought provoking and engaging. And then we get the action and the film is very entertaining. This film works on many levels and hits all the right keys to being a perfect superhero film and is just as good as the original Batman from 1989 by Tim Burton. One of the best action films I have seen in years and a true masterpiece. One of the best films of the year.",10,0,1,3 July 2005
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Grand Budapest Hotel
","The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the most entertaining and fun times I have had at the movies so far this year. With an elaborate and all star cast, plus Wes Anderson's usual original and eccentric type screenplays and beautiful cinematography, music and a brilliant performance by Ralph Fiennes, make this film a definite must see at the theatre. The film has it's own unique look and style to it which is very pleasing to the eye as well as suiting the setting and tone of the film as well. The performances are all great here, but I have to single out, Ralph Fiennes, as our lead character M. Gustave. This is a character who is suave, classy, charming, funny and one of the most interesting characters I have seen in a film in quite awhile. Fiennes plays this character to sublime perfection and it is an absolute joy to watch this character and Fiennes portrayal of him on screen. Fiennes has been nominated for two Oscars before, but has never won and I sincerely hope that The Grand Budapest Hotel, will become his third nomination and maybe even first win. It was just such a lively and spirited performance and as I said both a joy and very entertaining to watch because of how well written the character is, plus Fiennes' top notch performance. The writing here by Wes Anderson, is brilliant as is most of his screenplays and while I have admired every film I have seen by him (Bottle Rocket is the only one left I have to see), I would say that The Grand Budapest Hotel is both is strongest and best film since 2001's The Royal Tenenbaums. Sometimes, I feel that some of his later films have a little more style to them than substance, and while I still have liked everything he has done, I think I still do prefer his earliest films such as Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums the best. While, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is certainly high on style from it's elaborate sets, costumes and makeup and while it is an absolutely gorgeous film to look at, I did not find the style overwhelmed the film, or took away from the story in any way. Some of his films I have had that criticism with to certain degrees, but here I think Anderson found the perfect balance of both style and substance. It has an absolutely wonderful screenplay full of fascinating and well written characters as well as a lot of action, adventure and humour along the way as well. Going along with this wonderful story is a lot of beautiful cinematography, sets and art and set decoration which further add to the film and give it an amazing look that seems relatively familiar to us, but at the same time, also like nothing we have ever seen before. I like how Anderson chose to do a period piece film and add elements of old cartoons and spy novels and movies to the film to further enhance the action, adventure and overall fun sense that the film carries with it from start to finish. I know that Wes Anderson's films are certainly a required taste and are definitely not for everybody. I have shown his films to people in the past and they didn't care for them at all and I have also read film reviewers who just never got his work, or understood the appeal people find with his films. Although while reading some reviews of The Grand Budapest Hotel, I did notice that some critics who usually did not care for Wes Anderson's work, that this time around they changed their minds and really embraced and found a lot to like with The Grand Budapest Hotel. Perhaps that is because in certain ways it is one of Anderson's most accessible films because of it's high energy and fast paced script and direction. Also, I would challenge almost anyone to sit through this film and not find it fun and entertaining. I think you would find few who would disagree. Still, I fear there will be some who just will not be able to get into the film finding it perhaps too quirky, or offbeat for their tastes, but at the same time for anyone who maybe has never liked Anderson's previous works, or are new to his body of work, I would say that The Grand Budapest Hotel is a great place to start. I hope that because of this film's release early in the year that it will not be shunned, or forgotten come next Oscars season. There is plenty the film could be nominated for such as Best Actor (Fiennes), Best Original Screenplay as well as cinematography, makeup, costume design and art direction. I think based on the excellent reviews the film is receiving that is still could be fresh in voters minds come next fall, or winter, so hopefully it does get some nominations and maybe even Anderson his first Oscar after three nominations and no wins. As for The Grand Budapest Hotel, it is simply sublime in every way possible and I laughed, was entertained and in a perpetual state of joy as I watched this wonderful piece of creativity and art. I had an absolute blast and I think many other viewers will as well, so if this film is playing anywhere near you, be sure to see it now because the theatre is the right place and atmosphere to do so. As it remains, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the best films of 2014 so far.",10,1,5,21 April 2014
Gone Girl," Gone Girl
","I was eagerly awaiting the release of Gone Girl, with high hopes and expectations based on the reviews that I had read, plus also because of David Fincher's very impressive body of work. All in all, I would have to say that I liked the film very much, but I did not love it. I think one thing that may have impacted my decision a little bit, was through no fault of the film whatsoever, but of online movie critics. I was reading different reviews of the film online (some of professional critics and some not) and I just found that in the reviews that I read, too much information was leaked out and spoiled about the movie, so that when I went to watch it, there were certainly plenty of surprises, but all in all I mostly knew where the film was going and I now wish I had entered the theatre knowing nothing about the film and that probably that might have made a bigger impact on me then. The style and satire of the film was also something I had to get used to. The constant media coverage surrounding the characters and the events in this film and the police who were profiling to the point of actually being obnoxious, to me at first was kind of aggravating. As the film went on however, I noticed that this was some tongue in cheek and almost satirical humour from the point of view of the writer and director. Just the fact that today's media and news outlets control so much of our thoughts and perceptions about certain events and news stories and there is always some sort of media bias, or slant to each situation. Here in Canada, we have the network broadcaster, CBC, and I can only truthfully watch some of their news programs because I find that so much of it is slanted and biased with a more liberal, or left wing style approach and while that may be fine for some, I find their politically correct and skewered way of doing the news often annoying, not truthful and not to my way of thinking, or my attitude towards world events, or politics. I only watch the station sparingly. It does seem you get that kind of bias from whatever news, or station you watch and just some of the bias is more obvious than others. So, I appreciated the film's jab and poking fun nature at this subject as it has long been a beef with me as well. I had to get used to the obnoxious cops and newscasters in the film, but when I did I appreciated the satire all the more. A few other complaints about the film revolve around certain events and sometimes it almost did seem very implausible and unrealistic. After you have seen the film (no, I am not giving anything away), you look at the film and start to wonder why certain things went to such measures of the extreme to pull off other things and it just baffles the mind. Should one be impressed by this type of storytelling? Repulsed? What was the message, or theme that they wanted to get across to us the viewers? The film was interesting on a level where we break down the characters and try to analyze them and figure out why they are doing what they are doing, but in the end there was fascination on my part, some disbelief and just plain some stuff that I did not get. The film's length did not bother me, but I did feel that certain scenes especially towards the end of the film could have been trimmed down a bit and overall were just not necessary to the film, or to the plot. There were a few plot holes in the film that I had a little problems with, but now on to what I did like about the film. As a whole, Gone Girl, was in very capable hands and the filmmakers did mostly succeed in doing a very good film. The acting from Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike and the entire cast was all excellent and almost certain to cause some acting nominations at next year's Oscars. The film was slick and stylish with it's lighting and creepy, but atmospheric music. The film did keep and hold on to my interest even though it was a longer film and it awakened a whole bunch of emotions from me while watching the film. I always think that if you watch a film and it makes you feel at least something, then the filmmakers have succeeded on their end of the spectrum. While the film is far from perfect, it is still a very powerful and chilling film that is very well done and worth watching, I just would not recommend reading too many if any reviews on the film before you actually decide to go and see it. I will be curious to know what The Academy Awards will make of a film like this. It certainly is a warped and very different film, but could that lead to Oscar gold? I look forward to when the nominations come out to see for sure. As for Gone Girl, it was very close but not enough to be a masterpiece, or a perfect film, but it still is very good and worth seeing at least once.",9,1,9,13 October 2014
Django Unchained," Django Unchained
","I've often felt that when Quentin Tarantino directs his own scripts the results are for the most part huge successes for critics and his admirers as well. When he has written something like Natural Born Killers, or True Romance, both of which were directed by other directors, they had some mildly interesting moments, but for the most part did not work. Here we have Django Unchained, which he has both written and directed and while I am a Tarantino fan, I have to be honest and say that it is the weakest, or at least one of the weakest of his films as a writer and a director. I was a little torn and undecided exactly what to say in this review because there were certainly parts of this new epic that I really admired and considered to be quite well done. On the other hand, there were parts that were terrible and an ordeal to sit through which made the film feel uneven and the 2 hours and 45 minutes of the film dragged, I mean really dragged. I could understand that he wanted to revisit familiar territory and make a spaghetti western with a combination of a blaxploitation film thrown in as well. Whether you like Tarantino, or not, you will have to admit that a lot of his ideas and concepts are borrowed from older, or basically other people's films. He seems to repeat and show the same type of story lines, dialogue and style in almost all of his movies, which I guess is paying off due to the high box office grosses of the films and also the numerous award nominations as well. Django, did not work because it tried to do too many things at once and on almost all accounts it failed. There were times when it tried to be humorous and it tried to set up a gag, or a punch line for amusement, but those scenes just felt so out of place and it didn't seem like Tarantino knew what he was writing and the actors often seemed clumsy and having difficulty delivering these lines and scenes. Instead of being interesting, or funny, or humorous as it's intentions were it just felt painfully awkward and like scenes that belonged in another way different type of film. I know I have criticized others droning on about the length of one's film before, but this time I can not excuse Django Unchained, because it's pacing and timing was all over the place and felt like an editing mishap and overall a mess. We have so many scenes that just do not work because they are written and performed awkwardly and they don't seem to have any clear purpose, or reason for being in the film other than to use up time. Take director Michael Cimino for example. Heaven's Gate has a scene that lasts a very long time when they are at the character's university early on in the film. The scenes goes on for a very long time, but has little to say and has no real relevance, or has any point, or purpose being in the film. It just drags. Same with his The Deer Hunter, which I like considerably more than Heaven's Gate, but what about the wedding scene in that film? The same thing. It goes on without any real purpose, or anything relevant to say. That is one of Tarantino's big problems with Django Unchained, it is almost like he wrote a bunch of ideas down on cue cards and when it came time to pulling together a script, he had to use every single last idea, note, or brainstorming idea he had and put them all in this film whether they worked, or not, or even made the film seem messy and jumbled. He didn't really seem to care. I have nothing against long films, or even films that have slower scenes in them, but they have to offer some kind of benefit to the film, the story, or the overall experience of the film. If not, having them in there just makes the film long, ambiguous and tiresome. There were things I liked about Django Unchained, particularly the supporting performances by Christoph Waltz (who continues to shine after Inglourious Basterds), Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. They are all at the top of their game here. One thing I really missed in this film that is more evident in other Tarantino films, is his flare for dialogue. My favourite scene of the whole film is where the main characters are sitting at a dinner table and Tarantino, creates tension and a mood because of his great knack of dialogue, what the characters say and getting these great actors to play it. I wish there had been more scenes like that in the film, but unfortunately there were not. The action scenes this time seemed a little too over the top and corny and a lot of the film did too, which further made me wonder what type of a mood Tarantino was going for. A lot of it just really seemed like they were trying to ham it up and be ridiculous, but those scenes were followed by others of extreme brutality and gruesomeness that didn't work either. I continue to admire Tarantino as a writer and filmmaker and while Django Unchained had a few honourable merits, there were not enough for me to call this a great film, or make me want to see it again.",7,3,9,2 January 2013
Drive," Drive
","Trying to give as little away as possible, I will tell you that Drive is about a racing car stuntman who also works at a garage. He is a quiet person and a bit of a loner, but he strikes up a friendship with his next door neighbour named Irene. Irene's husband is just getting out of jail and the driver character seems to bond with them all, especially Irene and her son Benicio. This leads to helping Irene's newly released husband on a robbery mission that goes horribly wrong and the rest of the film is a mix of a thriller and action film. I am going to say first off that I thought Drive was a very good movie, but it could have been a lot better. The first half of the film did everything right. The lighting and cinematography was haunting yet gave the film a lot of style as did it's music and Ryan Gosling's performance as the driver was excellent. The characters and the way things were done was also excellent. The first half of the movie we find Ryan Gosling's quiet character so fascinating because we know so little about him and we want to keep watching to learn more about him. He was a very well written character and Gosling gives a subdued yet passionate performance at the same time that is pulled off beautifully. The film had a haunting beauty to it, but also a sort of dread and mystery that I was really enjoying. The film looked great, had a great cast, music, cinematography, pretty much everything. So why was it not a perfect film? The first half of the movie was so interesting and innovative that I felt the second act really let it down. The second half reminded me like it could have come out of any action, or thriller film playing today. Yes, it was stylish, but at the same time nothing really new. When you take the beginning of this film that is so groundbreaking and new and then you use the second half to present a very familiar formula we see all the time, I just did not feel it worked. Drive is still worth seeing, but I should mention that some may be turned off by the violence. It is still worth seeing for Ryan Gosling's excellent performance about a mysterious yet troubled person who is really a deeply layered character that I just found fascinating. The look and feel of the film which reminded me of old cult movies from the 70's or 80's and also had a very European feel was very fresh and interesting and I really liked it. I just wish the second half would have gone a different way and focused more on the characters and the mystery of the driver character than going all gory and vigilante on us. It is still definitely worth seeing, but if the second half was as good as the first I could definitely call it one of the year's best films, but as it is I will say it is very good, but needed improvements.",Null,3,9,18 September 2011
The Theory of Everything," The Theory of Everything
","Before going into and seeing, The Theory of Everything, I really did not know too much about Stephen Hawking. I of course knew who he was and that he was a famous physicist for his work on black holes and other such matters and I had also seen video clips and photos of him, but really knew otherwise next to nothing about him and I have never actually read any of his books, but after seeing the film I am a little tempted and curious to do so, even if the subject matter does go over my head a bit (I both did poorly and did not enjoy high school physics class). On the other hand, those who go into The Theory of Everything, looking for an elaborate account of Hawking's work and his science and the method behind his work, then those people may be in for a bit of a letdown as this story while it does focus on Hawking's life, it mostly focuses on his long marriage and relationship with his wife, Jane, who wrote the book on which the film is based on. The film focuses heavily on the relationship between Stephen and his wife, Jane and the hardships they had to deal with due to his various health problems that he developed when they first become interested in each other till the present time. Eddie Redmayne, who plays Hawking, does a phenomenal job here. He starts out as a shy, somewhat bookish and nerdy student who has a fair bit of humour to him and also has a love of education and finding out the big questions and answers of the world. As his illness develops and progresses over the years, we see how hard it is for him to move, speak and just do everyday things whereas he is eventually confined to a wheelchair and has to speak through a computer. Redmayne's performance is so believable and must have been really hard to pull off as we see him struggle to eat, walk, speak and just how he twists his face and muscles and how much physical difficulty and pain is involved in this as well as his strong desire to succeed and to achieve more and more each day is evident in Redmayne's wonderful performance which must have been exhausting and difficult to play, but he does an excellent job here in what I think is one of the year's best performances. Equally good here is Felicity Jones, who plays Jane. While the role is not as demanding physically, it is more demanding emotionally as we see her totally devote herself to all of Stephen's every waking needs and how she went out of her way to both care and love for him. At times it was certainly difficult and I am sure she just wanted to give up, but we also as in him, see her determination to make things work and she is an incredibly strong person and character and you can see that everything she does has her full best and wonderful intentions. Her performance is an emotional one and is beautifully and brilliantly portrayed as well and is also one of the year's best performances. When the film first started out, I thought it would be a fairly safe and by the numbers biopic, but it really took me by surprise at how interesting I found these characters, their lives and the situations they found themselves in. Again because of the brilliant performances and masterful script and direction we can both care for and have empathy for these characters as well as personally cheer them on and wish all the best for them as we are sitting quietly in our theatre screens glued to the screen with captivation and interest. The film has an excellent pace to it and works well as a biographical film, but works even better as a story of love and the difficulties and sacrifices it took to make it work and just how strong both Stephen and his wife are at the end of this film after all they have gone through. It really is an inspirational and feel good film when you think about it after all they accomplished and went through. Sure there are moments of heartache and when we see them suffer, but it is not all grim. We also see moments of happiness and how these two, from the second they met, really do love each other and had a marriage full of trust and devotion to one another. The film is doing well in limited release and expanded wider in theatres this week and I feel very privileged to have been able to see it on the big screen. It is thoroughly fascinating from start to finish and features two of this year's most believable and best performances and also gives us hope and encouragement while we may be not exactly in their same circumstances, but for other things as well. The Theory of Everything, is a real triumph and one of the best films of 2014.",10,97,133,29 November 2014
Room," Room
","Of all the films coming out last year, I would definitely have to say that Room was one of my most anticipated releases and one of the films I was most looking forward to. Having now seen the film, I must say that it did not disappoint. I was mentioning in my review for Brooklyn about how we are getting a lot of really good female driven films that have great female performances and great perspectives from a woman's point of view and I would certainly add Room to that list as well. Room, is not based upon a true story, but the events in the film were most likely taken out of the newspaper headlines because we have had a lot of these cases surface and come to light within the past couple of years. The film does an excellent job of conveying what being trapped in a small space would have been like and while the film is quite disturbing at times and leaves you with an unsettled feeling it is also emotionally very powerful and also has moments of great beauty and humanity thrown into the film giving it a wonderful balance of both tragedy, loss and despair as well as hope and love and knowing that with time that everything will turn out okay. The two lead performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are amazing and two of the best performances of this past year, or really any year lately. Larson has proved what a talented actress she is with films like Short Term 12 and now Room will definitely be the film she will receive a much deserved Oscar for. I was really in disbelief though that Jacob Tremblay did not receive an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Jack. Here is a young kid who delivered one of the best child performances I think I have ever seen in a film and he proved himself totally capable of handling and delivering a performance in what is an emotionally really intense film and one that I think even people more than half, or triple his age would find difficulty in doing, but he makes his performance so natural and believable and we believe every second what he is thinking and going through and with his total fascination with the world and the things around him. This was a great oversight for the Academy by not nominating him because it was certainly one of the top performances of last year and worthy of an award. I am so glad that Brie Larson was nominated though and her performance is so great that I know she will be walking away with Oscar gold. Here is a character who goes through the unthinkable and yet while she still struggles during and after her circumstances, we see what a brave and independent woman this is and how for all the years in captivity she put her young son, Jack and his needs in front of her own and always looking after his best was just amazing and completely heart warming to watch. As others have said this film truly captures the deep and personal relationship between a mother and son and the endless love that goes with it. Larson's character is loving and caring for Jack, but we also see how she is strong and even later in the film while dealing with depression and trauma for what she went through we are completely with her every step of the way and again this is such a beautifully natural and realistic performance and one that must have been extremely emotionally draining and challenging to play each and every day, but Larson pulls it off flawlessly and is totally deserving of what is sure to be her first of many Oscars. The film would unfortunately maybe be too difficult for some to watch because of the heavy emotional content and the subject matter of the film, but I would challenge any serious film goers to give the film a chance anyways because it is such a wonderful cinematic experience and one that will surely move you and challenge you in many ways. Often throughout the film as I mentioned earlier, there is also scenes of love, family and maybe even in a sense coming to terms with yourself and the events of your life and these such moments did bring tears to my eyes and deeply moved me. This is a film where we certainly see that there are a lot of bad people in the world who do terrible things to one another, but the film does not let us lose hope because we are also confronted and experience the love between this mother and son and a relationship that does get challenged, but never broken and the strength that family and the right people in your life can have. This is not a film about despair, or the evils of mankind and yet while it does deal with that, this is overall a film about hope and overcoming your past and struggles and finding your peace in life even after a terrible trauma which is further helped by your loved ones. The film is certainly realistic and gritty at times, but all the more natural and real because of it and this is one of the most emotional and best cinematic experiences I have had of last year because we identify with these characters every step of the way and we feel hope and compassion for them and in many ways see that the outside world and things in it are truly beautiful and a wonder to behold and that personal growth and healing can happen to us all no matter what our circumstances.",10,1,6,31 January 2016
Across the Universe," Across The Universe
","Across The Universe is a musical set in the 1960's about a group of young adults who discover love and friendship among other things of the time such as the war and protests that came with it. The film's characters sing and the music of the film is of classic songs by The Beatles and instead of just playing the original songs the actors in this film sing them themselves and the music is set against the events going on in the film as well as some visually stunning backdrops and cinematography all meant to look and have the feel of the whole 60's psychedelic era and very reminiscent of the Beatles animated film Yellow Submarine only unlike that this is not animated. This film seems to be pretty divided by critics and audiences. I have read some reviews by critics who have loved the film and others who have hated it. I have heard of some members of the audience walking out of this film and others who will not even see it because they think it looks terrible. I personally thought this movie was great and even though I liked it a lot I could see where it might not be for everyone. I have heard some people say that the story in this film wasn't really anything new and lacked originality. I enjoyed the story and while it interested me and kept me entertained I think the real highlight and thing to see about this movie isn't necessarily the story, but the music it is set to and the wonderful and almost hallucinatory sequences they are set to. I personally am a big fan of The Beatles music, so I enjoyed the soundtrack to this film immensely even though I have heard many of these songs before on classic rock stations that almost play them to death. However because these songs have so much energy and because they are still catchy, well written and just enjoyable songs I didn't mind hearing them again and I thought the main and supporting actors did a good job of singing them and as I already stated the sequences and images they are set to make for some very unique viewing. The colours and visuals of this film were very bright and really a treat for the eyes because of the uniqueness, originality and sometimes beautiful things they are set to. This really is a film that relies heavily on style and visuals, but the phrase style over substance isn't totally applicable here because I really enjoyed the story and the characters as well. This film was like watching a time capsule of the 60's from everything to the wardrobe to the hippie/beatnik lifestyle the characters lived and acted. This is a gorgeous and unique film filled with originality and wonderful music set to (at least what I found to be) an engaging story that could easily have taken place now almost 40 years later as well. This was a treat for the eyes and the ears and I enjoyed every minute of it.",9,1,3,13 October 2007
The Mist," The Mist
","The Mist is based upon the novella of the same name by Stephen King. The film takes place after a big storm where some of the townspeople gather in a grocery store and soon find out that outside of the store there are bloodthirsty creatures lurking around, so for safety they decide to stay protected in the store and barricade themselves in. However things take a turn for the worst when the store can not hold back all of the creatures and the people in the store soon realize that along with the creatures their own worst enemies are each other as well. Basically, The Mist reminded me of a type of film that would be released in the summer months because it is what I would call a popcorn film because of the action, entertainment and fun of it. The film also reminded me of a bad movie in the sense of some of it is very over the top, laughable at times, but despite this also very captivating and a joy to watch for a two hour entertaining diversion. I don't often say this, but the things that made The Mist so over the top including some of the acting and plot twists were also some of the things that added to the film's campy charm. And I never felt it was so ludicrous that it was embarrassing for the cast or the filmmakers. On the other hand there are a few strong performances in the film and the story is very intriguing and full of action and enough to keep you involved for the two hour running time and some of the effects aren't that bad either. There were also a few darker and more powerful moments injected into the film and instead of feeling awkward or out of place in an otherwise very campy film, I felt they worked and even strengthened the film in parts. What I also enjoyed was the film's character study which introduced us to many different characters and as the film goes along it also shows us their true human nature and will to survive and sometimes ending up doing terrible things to others to achieve their own survival. Basically other than a few main characters the others were mostly out for each other and the film captured realistically what it most likely would have been like in a chaotic situation like this no matter how far fetched the actual story is. I realize that I gave this film a very high rating, but it entertained me and kept my interest and because of some strong touches to the story as well as some well written characters and the fact that this is just one big popcorn film that would have been a big grosser had it been released in the summer months, so for all these reasons and if you are a fan of Stephen King or campy B movies that are a lot of fun then you probably will find something to like in this film as well.",9,0,6,24 November 2007
Gran Torino," Gran Torino
","Gran Torino is about a recently widowed elderly man named Walt Kowalski who lives in a more run down area of town and Walt is personally haunted by demons of his past and is a very conservative and bigoted person in his old age. He disapproves of a lot of the things the younger generation is now doing, can not relate to his sons, or grandsons or granddaughters and particularly has a problem with the new Oriental neighbours that moved just next door to him. The film eventually deals with Walt getting over some of his prejudices and making friends with the two neighbour children and bonding with them and also doing whatever he can to protect them from a gang that is targeting the two of them. The trailers and advertisements for Gran Torino make it look like an action film, or very much like one of the Dirty Harry films star and director Clint Eastwood would have done in the 70's, but this is actually quite different than what the trailers and advertisements would lead you to believe. The gang violence and dealing with them is a large enough part of this story, but I would say that the relationship that grows between the two neighbour children and Walt is the real story here and the one that is mostly focused on. Walt's own problems from past experiences to his current state of life are also a big burden on his life and we get to know more about Walt as the film goes on. What once looked like a cantankerous, bitter and racist old man actually through good storytelling is transformed into a really human and complex character with many deep layers that would need to be unraveled in order to help him and for him to be at peace. I personally really liked how the film's screenplay developed the Walt character and the others as well and there was a good mix of character study, drama, some amusing moments and even some action in the film and they all worked really well together in telling a powerful and thought provoking study of our own selves and the things we must change, or forget to move on in life. The screenplay is top notch allowing for some great one liners from Walt and an interesting and compelling story that is sure to interest most viewers who would give the film a chance. Clint Eastwood's direction also suit's the film well and more than anything one thing that really carries this film is Clint Eastwood's performance as Walt. Like I mentioned earlier at first Walt comes off as a grouchy and bigoted old man saying racist and bigoted things like he didn't care who heard them and then he almost becomes like a father figure to these kids living next door and we see the things he has continually struggled with in his life and how he sets to personally get rid of them. Overall a very powerful performance and one of Clint Eastwood's best that is definitely Best Actor worthy material. I also give Clint and the film's screenwriter a lot of credit for making a film that is so edgy at times and I think people who are worried about being offended, or turned off by the film should give it a chance and see that there is so much more to the film than just Walt's racist language. Overall a surprisingly moving, compelling and a great character study movie with an excellent performance makes Gran Torino one of 2008's best films.",10,0,4,18 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," The Hurt Locker
","The Hurt Locker is set in Iraq during the war and is about the team of soldiers who are sent out to find and deactivate hidden bombs. For me at least, war movies can be a really hit or miss thing, particularly depending on the individual film in question. I feel that a lot of them use the same kind of formula and style in their story and direction, so sometimes it feels like if you have seen one then you have seen them all. What I am talking about in particular is movies with strong leading characters who are portrayed as heroes and end up saving the day, or becoming a hero, whether they end up living, or dying in said film. With this statement I am not saying that I am for, or against war or have anything for, or against soldiers, but when you have so many different films in that genre that follow the same cookie cutter outline, it does get tiresome. At the same time there are some really great war films that break out of that mold and present us with many not a totally historically accurate piece of work, but at least an original way of looking at it and different with it's overall presentation. I had heard a lot of great things about The Hurt Locker and going by these reviews and some impressive trailers, I decided that it really was the type of film that I would like to go see at the theatre. I must say that it was an absolute privilege to see a film this good on the big screen and with an audience. Like the kind of war films I was praising above, The Hurt Locker does deal with a real war and real situations (no, it is not based on a true story) , but it is told with such power and filmed with a gritty realism and a scriptwriter with a knack for getting into the minds of these characters, that makes The Hurt Locker a compelling, tense and fascinating watch. The film does not have a political agenda for the viewers watching it. It does not support the war, or say that it is totally against it. A trait of the film that I admired. It does show soldiers who are completely dedicated to their mission and are willing to die for their principles, but at the same time we see that this war and the tremendous stress and pressure that they are under on a daily basis is obviously really starting to get to them and that it may take years, if not their whole life to get over it. The two main soldiers in the film are brilliantly played by Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie who both deliver award worthy performances as men who are brave on the outside and inside, but also have a realistic perspective on the war and the situation they are in and realize that they may not make it out alive and if they do they might not be the same people as they were when and if they make it back home. There are also parts of the film that show us the tender sides of these characters as well such as when Jeremy Renner's character befriends a young Iraqi boy and Anthony Mackie's character who is intent and determined to get himself and his team out of harm's way. I do really enjoy war films with a more human element and perspective to it because even though I have never been to war I can understand and hear on the news the tremendous fear and doubt that must go through these soldiers and this film showcases that as well as their bravery and also what they are like when they are in their quarters and just having a good time with fellow soldiers and friends (another powerful scene in the film). For it's gritty and realistic direction, character driven and fascinating script along with top notch performances, The Hurt Locker is one of the best films of the year, if not the best film I have seen so far this year. Forget all the other films I have given great reviews to, so far this year (yes, I know there are a lot), but forget those and do yourself a favour and see The Hurt Locker if it is playing near you, or when it comes out to rent. It is an unforgettable and brilliant piece of cinema that I was lucky and privileged to see on the big screen. A great achievement in film.",10,2,12,17 September 2009
The Illusionist," The Illusionist
","The Illusionist is based on the short story Eisenheim The Illusionist by Steven Millhauser. The film is set in the late 1800's and is about a magician named Eisenheim who does magic shows in theatres. As a child Eisenheim fell in love with a girl named Sophie, but her parents did not allow them to see each other anymore. Years later as adults now Eisenheim meets up with Sophie again and she is engaged to the crown prince named Leopold. Eisenheim hopes to use his illusions to get Sophie back to him. Also after a murder is committed in town Eisenheim helps to show Chief Inspector Uhl and the rest of the town who the killer is using his magic and illusions. The Illusionist has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good set decoration, good costumes and good makeup. The film is very good looking and everything is down to the very littlest detail making the film look like it takes place in the 1800's and the whole crew who made it look like that did a very good job. The story is very original and I liked the romance part of the movie, the mystery and even the scenes where Eisenheim is performing his illusions. The film at least for me was completely unpredictable and lots of surprises lay ahead for me and they were good surprises and added a lot to it. The film is well made in pretty much every way and the story had a good pace I thought and really drew me into the movie and it kept my interest very well without ever losing me. Even watching the scenes with the magic tricks were really neat to watch and just as the audience in the movie was amazed by the tricks I enjoyed watching them from where I sat as well. I again compliment the movie on it's very original story and a lot of imagination and creativity went into this script and it blends well with the different genres of the film. I was very pleased to see my local theatre get this film seeing as it is an independent film and as much as I liked it I would have to say the audience who I saw the film with really enjoyed it as well, so I applaud my local theatre for getting this film and I hope more people go see it. This film is award worthy in many different ways and at the end of the movie I was very satisfied by what I had seen. One of the best looking and more original films of the year and also one of the best.",8,0,1,2 September 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button
","The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is about a man born with unusual complications who later goes on to lead a normal life, but his unique condition may come back to haunt him and he must deal with that as he seeks work and falls in love. I was overall quite disappointed with this film. After seeing how many awards and nominations it has earned, I figured I would really like this story, but it left me with much to be desired. Technically the film is very well made with great makeup, sets, cinematography and visuals. I also liked the overall visual style and the period piece settings as well. The acting from the entire ensemble cast was also quite good, so I guess my main problem lies with the film's screenplay. I thought the first half of the film was fascinating and really quite involving and unique. I was actually quite intrigued about what would happen to this character in the second half of the film and that is where I was disappointed. Whereas, I felt the first half of the film to be quite interesting and have a good pace to it, I could not say the same for the second half. To me an original and intriguing idea just used many old Hollywood clich√©s and story lines and for me the film really started to drag. Normally, I do not have a problem with films with a longer running time and if I am really enjoying said film the time goes by really quickly for me, but this film had a longer running time and it was dragging for me and I was getting quite impatient for it to end. Not to mention that the second half of the movie was very sappy and melodramatic to the point of being ridiculous. It's one of those films that tries so hard to leave you with a lasting emotion, that it actually tries too hard and goes overkill with overly sad music and situations. I have nothing against sad movies, or even crying at a film, but when the film feels so forced on the viewer like this, it just does absolutely nothing for me. I wasn't heart warmed, or deeply saddened. I was just basically bored and ready to leave the theatre. If the second half of the film had been quite as well written, or original as the first half I could definitely see this film winning many awards and getting tons of praise, but as it currently stands I think it is just an okay film that could have been a lot better. Still this is just my opinion and others seem to love this film, so you the reader have to make up your own mind over the movie, but for me it just didn't hold up as well and resulted in another typical Hollywood film released at Oscar time hoping for a nomination, but with nothing new, or original. Too bad because it showed such promise.",7,1,5,11 January 2009
Pawn Sacrifice," Pawn Sacrifice
","Before going to see the new film, Pawn Sacrifice based on the true story of Bobby Fischer and his ultimate chess match between the then Russian champion, Boris Spassky, I encountered quite a bit of opposition from different people regarding the film and basing opinions on it before they had even given the film a chance and watched it. A lot of people seemed to be disenchanted by the fact that Tobey Maguire, was playing Bobby Fischer. I think a lot if not most of these criticisms were based on the fact that people did not seem to think that Maguire, neither looked, or had the same type of presence that Fischer had. Also being known as extremely temperamental (which later turned out to be a long battle with mental illness), would Maguire be able to pull off more of a complex role such as this? I think in a lot of people's minds it was kind of like the casting choice of when they got Ashton Kutcher to portray Steve Jobs in the 2013 movie about his life. I think it is safe to say that when Danny Boyle's version with Michael Fassbender opens next month that there will really be no comparison between the two performances and one will likely lead to Oscar gold whereas the original performance was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Actor for Kutcher. I will have to defend Maguire here and say that his performance throughout the film was pretty spot on. How truly it reflected the mannerisms, or real life episodes of Bobby Fischer, I do not know, but for a two hour film he captures your interest and gives what I thought was a decent and thought provoking performance. It won't win any awards, but for what it was it was good enough. Whether another actor would have portrayed and done the role more justice is something I do not know, and unless they make another biopic about Fischer, we will just have to wait and see. Another criticism was that the film should be a biography of Fischer and capture his whole life story as opposed to just covering the part of his life in the late 60's and early 70's with his chess match with Boris Spassky. While a full film covering all of those details would be absolutely fascinating, it would no doubt probably take too long to do and be a long film to watch, so I give credit to the filmmakers here who do touch also upon Fischer's early life and do a pretty good job of condensing everything into a two hour film. I would love to see a three hour biopic, or miniseries about Fischer, but who knows if that will ever happen. As the film stands though it is quite good. The film looks like it was done on more of a miniscule budget and I find that this aspect helps the film by not being overly flashy, or like a big budget Hollywood film. It feels more like a small indie film that is more concerned with storytelling and performances, which is what I generally tend to prefer anyways. The film is fascinating in several different aspects. Bobby's personality for one as one who is certainly dealing with paranoia and various forms of mental illness is riveting and fascinating to watch. You can see him further unravel as time goes by and how he makes these chess games his life and that it may also be the undoing of him. The fact that a lot of the people around Bobby including the American people and government seemed to me at least to be exploiting Bobby because of how good he was at chess and yet he certainly was a disturbed person, so should this have all been allowed to go on? And the fact that all the various world events at the time (the Vietnam War, the Cold War, the Watergate Scandal) all seemed to be put on the backburner over a game of chess between the Americans and the Russians. You can't help but feel that this was almost a clever diversion using a talented yet tormented man to bring forth this diversion whether he was mentally, or physically up to it, or not. Watching people play chess would probably turn a lot of people off because of sheer boredom, but here it is fast and slick and every bit as exciting as watching any other championship game of sports. The filmmakers have successfully managed to make chess and the playing of it interesting as well as showing all the world events at that time being wrapped up in these games and by also delaying, or ignoring the current political situations at the time. As well as Bobby's unraveling into mental illness and those trying to exploit him to better the name of America, the film does certainly leave a lot to think about. The writing is captivating here and the direction is low key but suit's the film perfectly. Maguire does a better than average job playing Fischer and the always good Michael Stuhlbarg and Peter Sarsgaard are great supporting players. The film is a look back at time at important events and makes you think even more about them, whether critically, or positively and makes a captivating time of it all. Definitively recommended viewing.",9,3,8,26 September 2015
Lincoln," Lincoln
","Lincoln, is a film that works on several different levels much to my delight. As a film about a famous historical figure, a drama and an involving character study as well. Because most people will have probably learned about Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation in history class and many other details about Lincoln, some of this story will seem familiar because of facts we have learned over the years from textbooks and grade school and high school classes. However the film offers a lot more about Lincoln, that I had ever contemplated, or basically knew before going into the film. The film basically does focus on Lincoln, as he is in his second term as president and the civil wars has been going on for a couple of years now. Henceforth the decision to abolish slavery and put an end to the civil war. Historically, I do not know all the little minor details and things that some historians, may, or may not have a problem with. Being a Canadian, I only know so much American history and I felt that I walked away from this film having learned more and appreciated more than I did going in. Whether this was because the film was carefully researched and displayed the facts and evidence carefully, or because it was a well put together and powerful film, or perhaps both that satisfied both my film critique of the film, but also gave me food for thought and helped fill in some of the background of American history that I had only ever had a basic concept of before. Having said that let me share with you some of the things that I did not know about and thought the film tenderly and affectionately brought to the screen. Abraham Lincoln, is seen here not as an overly complex, or difficult character to figure out, but I really liked that about the film. He is seen as a calm and soft spoken man who generally seems to care and have empathy and compassion for those around him. He seems to be slow to anger even though he does have occasional moments of anger and frustration trying to get this bill passed. We see that he loves his wife, but there is some distance between them, perhaps even lost love over an event that we learn in the film has grieved both of their hearts and unfortunately maybe had an affect on their marriage and feelings about one another as well. Then we have quiet scenes where we see Lincoln, playing with his young son and just the respect and love they have for each other. Those scenes I found particularly heartfelt and beautiful. The film does portray Lincoln, in an honored and respected view and going by the film I can completely see why they did that. Here is a man who is president of one of the largest and most powerful countries in the world. He has a lot of responsibility, a lot he has to get done and probably a lot of stress and pressure to deal with. However, he does not brush off his family, or have an arrogance to him, or even a sense of entitlement, or prestige that he thinks he is better than others. He seems to identify with the common man and woman of that time and we see that in the way he talks, behaves and perhaps how he is governing the country. I marveled at Daniel Day Lewis's brilliant performance of the president. It is not just a great performance because he looks and sounds like him. There is so much more to it than that. Just his posture and his soft voice and the fact that he can become so passionate about something and almost be in a rage and then the moments where he is laughing over an amusing story, or anecdote to where he quietly and lovingly plays with his youngest son. There is so much range, depth and emotion in this performance and Lewis makes us believe he is this man and he makes us have respect and love for him not just because he is a good man, but because he makes him believable and relatable. The supporting performances I all really enjoyed as well, particularly Tommy Lee Jones's performance also. The film looks authentic and though it is a slower paced film, I felt it captures the audience's attention because of the performances, the detail to authenticity and because of a story that is filled with engrossing and captivating characters and events and sometimes some great humorous scenes as well. I loved knowing more about Lincoln, both with his presidency and the legacy of his work, but also really appreciated getting to know him with the people that surround him, whether it be his family, co-workers, or people who have, or maybe even didn't vote for him as well. A powerful and affectionate portrayal that is not forced or sappy and emotional, but allows us to care because of these real people whose lives we can identify with before us and the passion and technique that went to bringing it to the screen. One of the best films of 2012.",10,5,12,18 December 2012

Million Dollar Baby, has good direction, a good script, great performances from everybody involved, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction and good set decoration. Million Dollar Baby, starts off a bit slow and I didn't know if I would like it or not but soon the film became more and more interesting and you could really start to like and care for these characters. And there is a lot more to this story than boxing and sports. It also deals with emotions and things that people actually have to go through like everyday struggles. In telling us this story Million Dollar Baby is intimate, full of emotion, powerful, a good character study, is touching and overall a sweet and tender film. Million Dollar Baby, is one of the best films of 2004 and it will appeal to those even who don't like sports. A truly great film that I hope does well this awards season.",Null,1,3,6 February 2005

The Imitation Game," The Imitation Game
","The Imitation Game, is a masterpiece of a film that I feel so glad to have been able to see on the big screen. My last visit to the theatre, I saw The Theory of Everything, which has a fair bit in common with The Imitation Game. Both are excellent films and some of the best of 2014, they are both British films, they are both period pieces, both based on true stories and real people and they deal with main characters (Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything and Alan Turing here), who are socially awkward and have very distinct types of personalities, but at the same time, while they may be limited in their social abilities both of these men were brilliant and both have changed how we view things and life here in the 21st century. Both films are equally fascinating dealing with genius minds at work and also how these characters function and deal with everyday life with their limited social abilities and other things that would later lead to difficulties for both of them. Both stories have elements of tragedy in and to them and yet at the same time both of these films and characters we learn to respect greatly and have admiration for, even with their flaws, errors of judgement and little idiosyncrasies. With, The Theory of Everything, as I stated in my review, I knew a little bit about Stephen Hawking before I saw the film. Not a lot mind you, bur I knew who he was and a little bit here and there about him. The Imitation Game, is a different thing altogether though. My history is more than rusty and I knew nothing about Alan Turing, or what he had accomplished and the story behind his life and work before I saw this film. In a way that was too bad that I did not know such a genius mind as his and all that he had accomplished, but on the other end of the spectrum, it was probably a good thing that I didn't know anything going into this film because everything that happened during this film was a complete and total surprise to me and I had no idea how the film would turn out (besides some of the more obvious and the little history I do know), but that I had not known about was surprisingly fascinating and captivated me while thoroughly entertaining me and giving me a rich and very rewarding cinematic experience. I would imagine that most people around my age group, or younger, would probably fall into the same category knowing little about the person, or subject matter, but again that doesn't matter and it makes the film all the more an educational and fascinating experience to be had. The screenplay here which is based on a book and of course, real facts is an excellent adapted screenplay giving much historical accuracy and deep study into the events and things that plagued these brilliant minds as well as the whole world during the second world war. The screenplay is also a great character study and delves deep into what makes Alan Turing, the man he is as well as exposing his insecurities, his social awkwardness, arrogance and pride as well as his downfalls and some of the torment he has carried with him his whole life as well. He is not just a simple character that is as easy to deconstruct as my review may make it seem. This is a multi layered character and person who has so much going on with his personality, emotions and what is in his mind that he is fascinating to study and to watch and the whole thing is further enhanced by Benedict Cumberbatch's spot on and excellent portrayal of him. Cumberbatch is now a household name and a popular one after his successful show and performance in the modern day Sherlock Holmes series as well as being in numerous excellent films over the past couple of years in supporting roles and doing a great job in them and now he has his own chance to shine, and boy does he ever. Keira Knightley, is also excellent in here as well. I find that when she is given great scripts and roles such as in Atonement, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World and now this, that she is a great actress as well and needs more of these type of roles. The whole cast here is excellent and worthy of acclaim and praise as well. The attention to detail during the film's period piece setting was both accurate and appropriate and I like how different aspects of Turing's life were brought up in this film showing many different sides and aspects of his life, some of which many of you do not know about and which I will not spoil for you in this review. All in all a extremely fascinating portrayal of an interesting man with a lot to offer, but dealing with his own demons as well and also this film does an excellent job of retelling an historical event and making it both fresh and important to today's movie audiences as well. The Imitation Game is a masterpiece and one of the best films of 2014.",10,4,12,10 January 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Charlie And The Chocolate Factory
","Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, is based on the book of the same name by Roald Dahl, and was also previously a film in 1971 entitled Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory. The film is about Charlie Bucket, a poor boy who lives with his parents and grandparents in a rundown house. Charlie, is fascinated by the town's chocolate factory run by the mysterious Willy Wonka. Nobody has seen him for many years and nobody is ever seen coming or going from the factory and yet his chocolate and candy treats are available all over the world and are very popular. One day it is announced that Willy Wonka, is having a contest where he is putting a golden ticket into five different chocolate bars and the child who receives a golden ticket will get a tour of his factory and a special prize will be given at the end of the tour to one lucky child. Charlie hopes very much that he will get a golden ticket because it is his dream to go into the factory. One day he discovers a golden ticket and along with his grandfather Joe, go along with the five other kids also accompanied by an adult guardian. The first is Augustus Gloop, who is an overweight boy who never stops eating. The second is Violet Beauregarde, who is very competitive and always brags about herself. The third is the spoiled and bratty Veruca Salt, and the fourth is a mouthy boy obsessed with television named Mike Teavee. Willy Wonka, leads them all through his wondrous factory and along the way they discover how bizarre Willy Wonka is himself and of course something unexpected awaits the kids further along in the factory. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everybody involved, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration, good costumes and makeup. As a child I read the book Charlie And The Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl, and I loved it. Soon after I saw the 1971 movie Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory, which I also thought was great and have since seen it a couple of times and have always enjoyed seeing it again. This new version is a great looking film with great sets, art decoration, costumes and makeup and it is visually imaginative and has a lot of neat visual treats that director Tim Burton, is well known for. Besides looking great the film is well acted and despite what some people are saying about Johnny Depp's performance of Willy Wonka being too similar to Michael Jackson, I thought he did a good job. The film was also entertaining and a fun movie that both adults and kids will enjoy. I was however disappointed that a lot of things from the book were changed in this movie whereas I would have liked it to have stayed faithful to the book. I also thought the 1971 film was a lot better because it was more faithful and it was a very charming film. For a reason that will always puzzle me author Roald Dahl, did not like the 1971 film and has since passed on. I'd be curious to know what he would think of this version if he was still alive. This version is good too but I think I liked it more for it's visuals and sets then anything else and in a lot of ways it lacks the magical charm of the first film. I'am still recommending this film and I also recommend the original version and the book as well which is a great book for kids as well as any book by Roald Dahl.",7,0,0,28 July 2005
Cold War," Cold War
","In a lot of arguments against modern films, or I guess the case could be made for older films as well, it seems as if audiences in general want all the easy answers and don't necessarily want to have to think for themselves or ponder a film and it's meaning after they have watched it. Cold War is a film that I think many would argue has not enough character development and a lot of viewers would be left scratching their heads as to why the characters in this film do what they do and why the relationship depicted in the film often feels strained and more like a love/hate relationship than one that is based out of love. I think here as with any number of art house, or films that would leave more up to the audience's interpretation as an emotional means, but also to have a lingering if not haunting effect upon the viewers after the film is over. There is I would argue a fair bit of character study on display here and what is not shown, or maybe instead is implied to the viewers, I would still say speaks volumes about the character's tendencies, personalities and overall motives as to how they live their lives and what is the logic or reasoning behind a lot of their decisions. The two main characters are often seen fighting either verbally, or a few times physically and there seems to be a general sense of tension and hostility between them. At other times we seen them in the throws of passion and as if they would never leave each other and like they mean the absolute world to one another. And yet these characters go years and sometimes close to decades without seeing each other and forming other relationships and commitments with their lives, but there still seems to be a yearning and a tiny if yet large fire blazing inside them whenever they do reunite whether it be for a brief, or lengthy period of time. One could argue that these two lovers are often very cold both emotionally and on a romantic level with one another, but I think for both of them that it is only a part of the attraction to one another and while they have tried (how hard is up to interpretation) to live apart, we somehow know and feel that in a sense despite the peculiarities within the relationship and the lack of emotion or depth still lingers a love that will ultimately conquer the contradictory forces both in their home lives as well as the country's backdrop as to where they are living as well. This is a film that is certainly a fine example of stage and spectacle and some of the song and dance numbers whether it be a more folksy traditional number on stage, or to the smoky and yet ambiance filled scenes set in Paris clubs that feels both cool and classy at the same time. This is a film that is heavy on mood and atmosphere and some of these scenes are amongst the finest I have seen in any film of last year, or in recent memory. The cinematography here is also amazing with any number of single shots, or frames that could easily be put on display in an art gallery with how much it says in each shot as well as the beauty captured in and around the events in and out of focus. The black and white photography is probably the best looking I have seen recently and the film's cinematography nomination at the Oscars was more than well deserved. Joanna Kulig who plays the lead character, plays her with a lot of intense emotion and feeling and yet can be quiet and vulnerable at times when the role requires it as well. It is one of the most impassioned and yet heartfelt and longing performances in recent memory and she could have easily won any number of acting awards for this spot on and powerful portrayal. The film looks great and sounds great and is certainly a sight to behold and I am pleased to say that it gives it's viewers a lot to think about and does not gives us a cheap way out, but instead allows us to linger on it's beauty and it's ugliness and the film is all the more resonant and powerful for having done so. One of 2018's best films and one of the most stirring and accomplished films in recent memory.",10,2,5,10 March 2019
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight
","The Dark Knight is based upon the Batman characters created by Bob Kane and is a follow up to 2005's Batman Begins. I remember in some earlier reviews of mine this year that I stated that I didn't even know if I would end up going to see The Dark Knight. After giving Batman Begins a perfect rating on this site you are probably wondering why I wouldn't want to see a sequel to a film I enjoyed so much. Well, when I saw Batman Begins in the theatres I thought it had a lot of style, action and kept me compelled and entertained and I found it a really good time at the movies. Hence the perfect review I gave it three years ago. Then, I saw it again on DVD and I did not like it at all. The thrills and excitement were gone and everything that held up so well the first time had vanished and rather than seeing all the good things I enjoyed about it on my first viewing, instead on my second viewing I found parts of it boring and I started to have a few problems with the acting performances. I still kept the rating on this site to a 10 because that was my first initial reaction to the film, but after not enjoying the film much at all seeing it a second time and having been entirely sick and tired of all the superhero films coming out this year I really couldn't have cared less if I saw The Dark Knight at all. Then all of the really good reviews for the film came pouring in all over the internet and I kept hearing how dark and bleak this version was and I even heard of one critic who couldn't recommend the film because of how dark it was. This intrigued me because I have always been a fan of darker fare and the fact that family members saw the film and told me that I would really like it ended up in me seeing it. And to my surprise I thought it was as close to perfect as a superhero film could possibly get and I would most certainly call it a masterpiece. The acting was all top notch from every performer involved especially by the late Heath Ledger who played the role of the Joker. I have seen Heath Ledger in other films such as Brokeback Mountain, or I'm Not There and to play this role he isn't more or less playing himself, but instead going totally out of character and playing a twisted and menacing psychopath and everything the Joker says, does and the evil in his facial expressions show that he is a true terrorizing evil. All of this is perfected by Heath Ledger who gives the best performance of this year so far and I would compare his performance as the Joker to last year's best performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. Day Lewis won an Oscar this year, so I see no reason why Heath Ledger couldn't get nominated, or even win the award in his memory seeing as he tragically passed away earlier in the spring. His performance was one of the best parts of the film. What was also so good about the film besides the top notch acting, direction and cinematography was it's story. Instead of being filled by non stop explosions, high tech gadgets and over blown self indulgent special effects, this film instead mostly focused on the characters and for each one involved we are driven deep into their minds to see the madness of the villains and the good and also troubled lives of the others including Batman himself. The character study here is so fascinating that anyone taking a sociology or psychology course couldn't help, but be interested. The story in the film had me drawn in from start to finish and I liked the menacing and dark tone to the film which I found all the more interesting and I liked how this film did not use formulas, or clich√É¬©s and instead gave us a straight out story that you would not know how it ended till the end credits rolled. The Dark Knight really hit me and made an impression on me. Even days after leaving the theatre I 'am still thinking about the film and certain scenes and characters in it. This is what I call a powerful, thought provoking and stay with you film that is so good that it has almost a power to remain in your mind like this. The Dark Knight is a brilliant achievement and I will go as far to say that it is the best superhero film I have ever seen simply because it is not like other superhero movies and this is also the best mainstream film of the year so far and I hope it is not shunned come Oscar time.",10,10,19,19 August 2008
Blood Diamond," Blood Diamond
","Blood Diamond is set in the late 90's in Africa and is about a fisherman named Solomon Vandy who is taken away from his family and forced to work in the diamond mines. The film is also about an ex mercenary named Danny Archer who is looking for diamonds. Solomon finds a diamond and hides it and soon meets up with Danny who helps him escape from the mine and Solomon promises to help Danny find the diamond he buried if Danny will help him relocate his family. The two are also helped by a journalist named Maddy Bowen. The film is in some ways a thriller about escaping the guards and the violence that rule the country and in other ways is a drama dealing with political issues and about a man trying to get back to his family. Winner of The NBR Award for Best Supporting Actor (Djimon Hounsou, who plays Solomon) at The National Board of Review. Blood Diamond has good direction, a good script, great performances by the cast, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. I was impressed by this film in the way that it was a longer running film, but it never got boring and always had a good steady pace. The performances are great and worthy of award nominations and I like how the film incorporated political issues into this story and at the same time got to focus on these characters and become a bit of a character study. This is a good looking film as well and it is well directed and has a good script too. The film is quite powerful and moving in several ways as we care about Solomon and wish to see him reunited with his family and we also feel bad for the people of Africa who have been subjected to all this violence and loss. This is a well made and engaging film with a great cast and crew behind it and a powerful and engaging story that should keep your interest right till the end. Blood Diamond is one of the better films of the year and I can see it's cast and crew being nominated for several awards by the end of the year.",8,1,3,9 December 2006
Elysium," Elysium
","Elysium wasn't particularly a movie that I wanted to see, but within the first while of the movie I thought it showed incredible promise. The premise and dealing with a subject that is very much a subject of discussion and debate today, the whole health care system, both in the United States and probably other parts of the world, is shown here in this story in what I perceived to be an imaginative and unique way of doing so. I was expecting the film to give me some food for thought and to give me something to think about and shed some light on what is a very controversial issue with a lot of people. While the film started strong and the premise looked like one that would deliver a satisfying, yet thought provoking film, was then thrown into the recycling bin and what we were left with was a gory, loud and unrealistic film full of lots of unbelievable action scenes, chases, explosions and good guy after bad guy more or less. The further Elysium, went on the more bored with it I got, and I checked my watch several times to see when it would eventually be over because once the action and the special effects started to take over and any shred of a story this film once had was totally gone, then I just stopped caring about the characters in the film, and the movie itself and I just wanted it to end. I just found that these long overblown action scenes were nothing new and just a display of special effects and action techniques that were neither interesting, or anything new to marvel at. I was a bit surprised by the end product, as I liked writer/director Neill Blomkamp's previous feature District 9, quite a bit. That was a film that was unique and with a good story that gave you a lot of food for thought and things to think about, but they also made it captivating and you cared for the characters and it was entertaining too. That is why I thought the first little bit of Elysium, showed such promise and I was hoping in a lot of ways that this would show and have a lot of the good merits of District 9, but they seem to have all been abandoned for action, explosions and blood and guts. The last half was almost a little too over the top in almost every was as well and some of it felt laughably bad. It's too bad this film didn't work because you had a very talented cast and crew who worked on it, but it seems all their efforts did not pay off. I think if Blomkamp had developed his screenplay better and abandoned all the action for a solid script that really had something interesting to say about the health care debate, but still have included the science fiction aspects and gave us something to reflect upon, then this could have been a great film. It just felt like Blomkamp got a bit lazy and instead of dazzling us with a great script, he chose to go the other way and supplemented the rest of the film with long, overblown and dumb action scenes. Elysium, was one of those films that I disliked so much, that I felt I had wasted not only my money, but my time as well by watching it. I hope that Blomkamp takes these words to heart and makes his next feature a lot more carefully because I really liked District 9 and this film showed some promise in the beginning, but overall did not work. I hope Blomkamp can make a good third film and I am confident that he will not just be a one hit wonder filmmaker with District 9, but he really has to apply himself for his third feature and overall abandon all the cheesy action for a good script, a task he is capable of and one I hope he achieves for his next feature.",5,1,4,27 August 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Alice In Wonderland
","Alice In Wonderland is based upon the books Alice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll. I am sure most people have seen the animated 1951 Walt Disney version of Alice In Wonderland and this new version is more or less a follow up to that film with one of the main differences being that it is not animated. This new version is in live action and when you go to the theatre to see it, they will be giving you a pair of those plastic glasses to see the film in 3-D. As a child, I do not remember how many times I saw the 1951 version of Alice In Wonderland, but it was always one of my favourite Walt Disney movies at that time. What, I liked so much about the original 1951 version was it's beautiful colours and unique characters and it was full of fun, mystery and a world of enchantment that really fascinated me and made me love watching this new world coming undone before my eyes. There was also a great deal of humour in it and it was a very entertaining and fun film to watch. Unfortunately, I can not say the same thing about this new 2010 version. A lot of the magic of the original film had disappeared for me and seeing this new version, made me wish I was watching the original animated one instead. While in the original everything in the world of Wonderland is bright, colourful and full of life, this new Wonderland is bland, dirty and not all that appealing. The light hearted touches such as some of the humour of the first film are mostly gone here. The acting here also I found to be bland from some performances and really almost one note performances, while other actors went so over the top for the roles with their acting style, that it became almost annoying and instead of being fascinating, or thrilling, it left me feeling bored. The costumes and the makeup of the film's characters all look okay to a point, but again a little too flashy for my likes, which did not fit the drab and boring backdrops that they used. The story also just did not captivate me. When, Alice is in her own world in reality, I found it to be uninteresting and quite boring and when she went to Wonderland, I found it over the top, annoying at times and not all that interesting really. I also had some problems with the film's script because it all felt a tad rushed. Then again I was glad to get out of the theatre when I did and if it had been much longer it probably would have given me more reason to complain. What, I was hoping for in this new version was another bright and beautiful world from a young girl's imagination with surprises and treats along the way to fascinate us and keep us in our own state of wonder. Instead, I found a dull and boring film that also relies heavy on technical effects, rather than story, making it another case of style over substance. Other people in the audience seemed to really like the film, so I am sure there is an audience for it, but it just was not personally for my taste at all.",5,3,8,7 March 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Drag Me To Hell
","Drag Me To Hell, for me at least was a much welcomed return to the old days of horror films that today's type seem to ignore. Instead of going for torture, or sadistic violence it relies more on a well written story, convincing acting and scares that don't come from graphic gore or brutality. The story I thought was very intriguing and was a rather original premise and once the macabre and horror film type scenarios come into play in the film, it grabs you and does not let go. I actually found myself jumping out of my seat several times during the movie and a lot of the time I did feel tense and exhausted because I personally really felt for the character in this film and after all that went on you felt as exhausted and scared as the main character of the film because it was handled so well and with tight direction, performances and script we feel like the character in the movie, which isn't always that great a feeling, but it leaves an impression on you and will definitely be a memorable experience. There were a lot of gross out effects and moments in the film that actually were a mix between being so gross and bizarre that it was almost humorous and at other times it made you squirm in your seat and feel nauseated. There still is enough violence and terror in this film, but I did not think it went into the hardcore violence just for sensationalism style that many of the films of the genre do today. This is a film that teenagers can actually see and those who are a fan of the horror genre should love it. In the theatre I was in it was mostly occupied by teenage boys and girls and there were a lot of screaming coming from the girls and various comments made during some of the grosser or more dark parts of the story. The film always got the atmosphere and the moments right, no matter what kind of a scene it was going for. The first part of the movie before it became a horror film was still interesting and played out as any well done drama would and the second half when it becomes a full blown horror film it had everything from music, to creepy sound effects and lighting and mood as well to really make one feel uneasy. This is one film that grabbed you and would not let go because a lot of it really happens so fast and there is so much energy and zest to this film that while you are grabbing the arm rests of your seat and your heart is pounding, you are still so into the film that you can not look away. This is thanks to a talented cast and crew who with previous experience, show that they know their horror movies and they can do them well, very well. This is one of the funnest and most uncomfortable (yet in a good way) horror movie going experiences I have had in quite awhile and this is probably one of the best horror films of the decade because it hit every note right and passed the originality test with flying colours and even while borrowing some trademark styles and techniques of older films, it didn't feel like a rip off of those older films, but rather an homage to them and honouring them. This film was a very fun experience and because I do have a taste for horror films this film really satisfied me and I look forward to seeing it again sometime soon and hope it leaves as big an impact on me as the first viewing I had. One of the best horror films of recent memory and one of the best films of the year so far.",10,4,8,31 May 2009
Selma," Selma
","It seems a film like Selma, could not come out at a more appropriate time than now. I am sure that everyone who reads this review and has paid attention to the news this past year, whether in print, online, or on television will be familiar with all the murders that have been going on and labelled as racially motivated. These stories (and there were quite a few of them), dominated the news headlines because of the uncertainty and ambiguousness of the killings as well as inciting people to create riots and marches and in some ways showing that even after all these years with the march in Selma, Alabama as well as the work that Martin Luther King, and others have done, will perhaps still not fully be realized, or come to the dream ending that they were originally hoping for. Were all these recent events across America, based solely on racism? I am no expert in criminology, or anything like that, but it certainly makes one take notice and consider such options for a moment. The film is an interesting testament to the racial times during the mid 1960's and the battle for integration and segregation no longer as well as the right to vote for all African Americans. The thing about this film coming out as timely and at such a time as this, is that it shows that in some ways we have accomplished a lot, but in other ways not so much. The message and the theme behind Selma, is certainly an interesting one and it is a very well made film, but I just wished I liked the film better than I did. While, I still enjoyed it and found a lot to admire about it, I did not find it a perfect film, or a masterpiece. I find it quite hard to actually pinpoint the negatives about this film because I really did not have too many problems with it and it was a well made film, both on the sides of work in front of and behind the camera. I liked how the film was more of an independent production and that everything in the film was more low key, subtle and gave a more authentic feeling and look to the events. As with any Hollywood film dealing with real people and subject matter, I often feel that the smaller you go in scope, sometimes the better your film will turn out. If this had been a film made for a lot of money with a lot of big names and actors in it as well as a lot of pomp and expenses poured into making it a big, huge, epic film, than I think the simple yet subtle tone the director went for, would have been destroyed and I don't think the film would have come out as well, or had as lasting an impact. The film is also a little slower in it's pace with no major action sequences, or anything like that, but instead thoughtful scenes involving dialogue and good acting and emotions to further emphasize everything that Martin Luther King, was trying to achieve and the various setbacks and racial overtones that were preventing him from achieving his dream. While the film was very interesting, well acted, written and directed, I did not feel I could connect with it on an emotional level like I was hoping for. At the same time, I did not wish for the film to be overly dramatic, or even melodramatic in either it's acting, tone, or music. That would have felt forced and ruined the film for me completely. I was also glad it did not go the route of Lee Daniels' The Butler, which could have been a really good film, had it avoided all political bias and manipulation that I felt completely ruined the film. Fortunately, Selma is not like that. Back to connecting on an emotional level, I just felt that often times the film and the characters and people in it, often felt distant to me and I could not connect, or emphasize with them as much as I wanted to. Yes, I certainly got the feeling that everything that was going on back then with the racial attitudes as well as some of the violence that erupted from it was terrible, but I often felt that Selma, looked at and addressed such issues at a distance and at times I found the film to be not quite delving deep enough into the character study, or the feelings and emotions that were happening to these people. The film certainly is not a bad film and I am still giving it quite a good rating, but it was one of those films that didn't affect me the way I wanted it to. Take 2013's 12 Years a Slave for example. That was an excellent film dealing with slavery and racial attitudes at a different time period, but it still felt just as relevant today and while the film was very brutal and sometimes hard to watch in it's depiction of such brutality and horror, I felt that it hit me hard on an emotional level and really made for an unforgettable movie experience. I could connect to that film and felt more of an impact with it and unfortunately, I could not say the same for Selma. Selma, did not need to resort to brutality to get my attention, but I just wished that it did not seem as stark, cold, or distant with the characters, or subject matter at hand and I think I would have enjoyed it even more if I could have connected to it in the same way as 12 Years a Slave.",8,1,4,19 January 2015
Grindhouse," Grindhouse
","Grindhouse features two full length feature films plus some fake trailers in between the two films. The two films plus the trailers are supposed to look and feel like the cult and exploitation films that were made in the 70's and appeared often as double bills at the drive in. For those unaware or unsure if they have ever seen an exploitation or 'grind house' film then you should know that they are usually films not made for a lot of money, often they look very grainy and have black lines every once in awhile going down the screen, cracking and popping noises during the film, not very good acting, often a lot of sex, violence and other things which usually made them X rated and usually they were very sensationalistic films meaning that pretty much everything in those type of movies were over the top from the acting, to the story and of course the violence and sex. Exploitation films started early and often tried to be educational such as the film Reefer Madness which has now become sort of a comedy classic because nobody takes it seriously anymore. Other sub genres of the exploitation era were blaxploitation (and featured such films as Shaft and Blacula), sexploitation (which featured any film by Russ Meyer such as Supervixens or Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!), shock films which were meant to be pretty shocking and repulsive, women in prison films and much much more. Basically if you have seen a film from the 70's with any of the criteria I have mentioned in this review with the few examples I have given, then you have seen a grind house film. So, I don't go on forever about this genre I will skip right to my review of this film Grindhouse in which there are two feature length films one being called Planet Terror and written and directed by Robert Rodriguez and the other is Death Proof which is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Having been a big fan of cult and exploitation films since I was a teenager I have noticed that often with these type of films the critics tend to give a lot away in their reviews and spoil all the fun, so I will not go into any detail whatsoever about what the two films, or even the fake trailers are about and I will instead tell you what I liked, or should I say loved about this double feature. As I mentioned above I love cult and exploitation cinema. To many people they would just be classified as trashy or good for nothing films, but I have always loved how fun, shocking and sometimes unintentionally funny they could be. Plus in my opinion any of those exploitation films from the 70's is more fun than any Hollywood popcorn summer movie they are releasing these days. Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino and the guest directors who made the fake trailers completely captured everything I loved about these 70's films and put it into this double feature. The films were entertaining, captured the look and dialogue of the 70's films and every last detail was done to perfection. If I were to pull out one of my exploitation films from the 70's out from my vast DVD and video collection and actually sat down and compared those films to these two films made in 2007 and meant to look like the 70's then I think it would look absolutely the same and everything they captured from the feel to the way of storytelling is so perfectly done it is amazing. Of course with all exploitation films they are likely to offend or turn off some, but I always liked that and I had a blast seeing this in theatres. These films entertained me and reminded me of the past films I loved. Also the fake trailers were done to perfection as well and if you have ever seen a 70's movie trailer then you know you really need to commend these guest directors for doing such a great job. For being one of the most fun, campy, outrageous and totally entertaining films I have ever seen in a theatre plus bringing me back memories from my favourite films and capturing the essence of them completely then you can probably already guess I loved Grindhouse. If this film sounds like it would be right up your alley then make sure to see it in theatres because it is one of the most fun theatre experiences I have ever had.",9,1,7,16 April 2007
The Artist," The Artist
","The Artist takes place in Hollywood in the late 1920's and focuses on a famous silent movie star named George Valentin. He has made quite a name for himself starring in some very profitable films over the years, but his career could be put on hold, or end permanently with sound and talking movies coming into play. The film also focuses on a young dancer named Peppy Miller, who gets her big break working on the talkie films, but early in her career she did work with George, and has always cared much for him and now will also do what she can to save his career. Because, The Artist is about a silent movie film star and takes place in the late 1920's the film that we are watching is actually a silent film. Most of the characters say what they have to say through expressive facial gestures and when there is an important moment of dialogue it is printed against a black screen in between shots of the characters. I have read online and even with people I am acquainted with, I keep hearing that people do not want to see this film for the simple reason that there is no talking in it. Never mind the fact of all the awards it has won and all the other great reviews and acclaim it has gotten. People can not seem to get over the fact that there is no talking. This did not bother me one bit, but having seen many wonderful silent films from the 1920's, or even earlier, this did not bother me because it does not impact, or take away from the story, it is basically just a different way of presenting it. I think if those skeptics were to see The Artist, their opinion would change quite quickly because this is such a delightful film that I would really find it hard for people not to like it. The film is very entertaining and captivating and the performances by the entire cast are all very good here. Yes, there is no talking, but they convey what they have to say and their feelings that come out of each scene with great posture and body language that once you get used to it, you do not miss the talking at all. The black and white cinematography looks great here as well as the costumes and sets of the era it takes place in. I also quite appreciated the story behind the movie and dealing with silent films drastically coming to a halt when sound is finally available and major studios jump at the chance to make talkie films in order to cash in on what they figure will be a huge success and the way of the future. Watching a film like The Artist, in 2012 we all know that the talkie films did become a huge success and that is how we watch films, or have watched them from that point on throughout the decades. It doesn't focus on this, but later on you have to wonder about what will happen to the characters when Technicolor comes in and films are no longer in black and white. I don't think that is quite as big an issue to people as sound because we still occasionally today have films made in black and white that try to capture a style and time period of long ago. I also wonder if maybe in his own way director, Michel Hazanavicius is also commenting on the current state of film in general these days. With the closure of some major video store chains it is now getting very hard to rent films and everything seems to be going over to digital. If we want to see a film we now have a hard time just going out and renting one, when the now preferred format is downloading off the internet and using streaming services to do so. I think eventually the few remaining stores and chains that even sell videos, DVDs and Blu-Rays will also unfortunately die out and again everything will be made digital. It will be a great convenience to many, but also to many a great inconvenience. People still seem to enjoy actually getting out and watching films at a movie theatre, but who is to say that that will last forever and if it one day soon may be available for people to watch on their own home systems as well. For us with any major hobbies such as film, or even music, the future of this media can be scary. The Artist tells a story with so much feeling and drama, but at the same time with a lot of humour and romance that it is a joy to behold. I absolutely loved this film from it's wonderful and feel good story to the great acting, directing and writing. I did not find that what they tried to do here with making it a silent film was gimmicky, or done to sell more tickets, or be self indulgent. I found it a very ingenious way of capturing the movies of old and bringing a part of them back to life for us. The film is entertaining, charming and great to look at and with great performances. Last year really seemed to pay a lot of tribute to classic cinema with Hugo and now The Artist, and I hope more people will give films like The Artist a chance and older silent films in general. This film was the little film that could. It came out of nowhere and won the attention and acclaim of critics and awards circles and also won my heart over as well. I absolutely loved every minute of The Artist. A classic in the making and one of the best films of 2011.",10,1,5,5 March 2012
La La Land," La La Land
","Recently filmmaker Ridley Scott admitted that he found the current state of cinema to be declining and even himself admitted to being asked numerous times to be a director, or somehow involved in any number of superhero related movies. Thankfully to this day he has not done so and while some of his choices as a director, or producer tend to be a little perplexing and leaving the viewer wondering why he did said project, I think he may be on to something with the general statement that cinema does seem to be declining in quality and what would have played on the big screen even 30 to 40 years ago, is not the same today and that same level of expertise, artistry and quality just doesn't seem to be there a lot of the time. Jean-Luc Godard once famously said that cinema began with D.W. Griffith and ends with Abbas Kiarostami. With the unfortunate passing of Kiarostami this past year, does that mean cinema is definitely gone for good? In some ways yes, but then again on the other hand you have a film like La La Land which is very much in the same kind of style and spirit of the movies of yesterday while being completely original on it's own, so maybe in a sense there is still hope for today's cinema yet. Within the first ten to fifteen minutes of La La Land, I really was not anticipating that I would end up liking the film as much as I did. The film started out with bubbly and very much pop flavoured dance and musical numbers that seemed so happy and bright that I felt that if the whole movie was this upbeat and sunny than I probably should have seen something else at the theatre instead because what I was witnessing was so sickeningly sweet that it would even turn most kids who grow up on that stuff off of it. Thankfully however the trailers I had seen for the film as well as everything else I knew about it proved to be true and that wasn't the kind of film this was going to be. Instead we do have a film that in it's own way is trying to recapture the magic and charm of the movies that generations ago people grew up on and films and music that we should be watching today instead of the countless hours we throw away on mindless entertainment and games with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The film loves old Hollywood from the movies to the actors to the big budget musicals of yesteryear. It also pays homage to music such as the jazz classics that I know any die hard jazz fan would go head over feet over. In a sense those also attuned to movies with a more European feel (think the French New Wave of the 50's and 60's) will also most likely find a lot to like here as well because this film is not simply just plagiarizing these movies and cultural icons of old, but instead borrows from their styles and techniques and as I said earlier, they make a movie all their own using those trademark pieces of style and music and they do so in a way that is pulled off to perfection and will leave even the hardest of film critics longing for movies from decades ago pretty pleased at what still proves to be talent and good work with movies and filmmakers in this current generation. The film is more than anything else a love story between two people who often at first seem completely at odds with each other, but with any good romance, sometimes the opposites do attract and can lead to magic. The film also incorporates old Hollywood and the fact that many classic films and even styles of music are dying because today's generation is different. People are now so into themselves, or their electronic devices that they no longer have the interest, or curiosity about the true arts anymore. I once had a film professor acquaintance who told me that in his university film class that the students he had did not want to see older movies, but things that were current, or modern at least to them. How incredibly sad. La La Land reaches out to those lost arts and shows us that these forms of art definitely need to stay alive and need to be rediscovered by each and every generation. The film also details the struggles of trying to make it in the arts scene and with all the rejections and disappointments you get, sometimes it definitely is hard to keep your chin up. However these characters have perseverance and will give it everything they got and ultimately prove that dreams can happen and sometimes with a little help you get not just get what you want, but maybe something better is lying just around the corner for you. La La Land has a lot of style, the musical numbers are all very well done and it's a film with some great character development and it truly will be relatable to this generation, but countless others as well. This is a film of originality that proves that Hollywood is not dead yet, nor is film and we might just have a few surprises left from some up and coming filmmakers, so with films like La La Land, Hollywood and film is still alive and thriving for now at least which I think is a great place to be.",10,5,12,15 January 2017
Up," Up
","Up is a new family friendly 3D animated feature from Walt Disney Studios and Pixar Animation. I do not always go to see family films, usually because I feel they are aimed at more of a younger audience and there is not much for me to enjoy, or be entertained by. Up is a different story entirely. Once, I started to see all the glowing reviews of the film, I figured I would at least give it a chance and I was so glad I did. I think there is a lot here that adults will enjoy and reflect upon and enough that will entertain children and keep them interested and make them laugh. For adults the plot does deal with aging and overcoming obstacles and learning to reach your dreams and deal with the sadness and loneliness in your life. The film does briefly deal with some of these issues which are more, or less things that will happen to everyone of us at some point in our lives, which is just a natural part of getting older and losing our mobility and perhaps losing the ones we love. Although we all know this will happen to us sooner than later, as the film shows, it is still not easy. While some adults may feel that these issues are not what they would want to subject their children to, don't worry because this film is a great film to see with the whole family and while there are some mature and thematic elements to it, it is nothing a child could not handle and it is not done in a disrespectful, or disturbing way. It may be sad, but wasn't also a lot of other Disney films that children have been watching for years? Also for the youngsters in the audience the film deals with adventure and again following your dreams, making friends and doing the right thing. Both of the main characters in the film seem to learn these life lessons from one another and they make a captivating, funny and charming two leads to this film. While, I appreciated the subtle and more thematic moments of the film there was still a lot of uplifting moments that were both touching and sweet. There was a lot of comedy as we are introduced to some wonderfully creative creatures later in the film and also a subplot that deals with good versus evil and a final showdown that will keep everybody watching. Up is a thoughtful and sometimes thought provoking film, but it still has the other qualities like humour, magic and adventure that families love about these kind of films. Not to mention that I really enjoyed the animation as well. I left the audience feeling really uplifted at the end of this film and it was a thoroughly entertaining 90 minute film and sometimes I even wish it had been longer. Another great addition to this year's lineup of movies including Adventureland and Drag Me To Hell (not family films though) and one of the best films of the year so far.",10,1,5,1 June 2009
Snowden," Snowden
","Over all the films I have seen by writer/director Oliver Stone over the years, I have always found him to be his absolute best when he is tackling a story, or a film centered on either politics, government and the conspiracies that sometimes go with it and various other headline grabbing issues involved with those who are currently, or were at one time in political office. I wish Stone would stick to making more of those type of films such as JFK, or even W., which I for one thought was vastly misunderstood and underrated by the critics. I am so glad that as a filmmaker he has chosen again to shed light on what is bound to be a controversial film and figure in it's lead subject, Edward Snowden. Now if you have seen any of Stone's films related to politics, or anything slightly controversial, or even if you have just listened to him on a television interview, it is no secret that he tends to be more liberal at heart and is more, or less against capitalism, or what would be seen as more conservative type ideologies, or beliefs. Surprisingly though, I thought he would paint an absolutely scathing portrait of George W. Bush in his 2008 film W., but much to my surprise and delight I found the film to be almost more sympathetic towards Bush and more, or less saying that he missed the ball (as demonstrated in some cleverly used metaphorical images in the film) as a president, but maybe his intentions were not all bad and he isn't the demon that the liberal media made him out to be. Certainly food for thought and something different than Stone's more typical left wing bias. Here we have the film, Snowden and again right from the beginning of the film we see that he is clearly on the side of Snowden, and truly believes that what he did was a truly patriotic and heroic act and that Snowden was truly acting on behalf of Americans and their freedom and ultimately their privacy and well being and with his film he is very clearly saying that Snowden is a hero even if not all persons think so. The film even if it does have this particular bias, or theme in mind while portraying him and the events that led him to leaking all this classified information against the government, even so the film is tremendously fascinating and truly one of those films that truly engages the viewer in thoughts and much deep thinking not only during the film, but afterwards as well. We as an audience are led through the events that cover almost a ten plus year history of the events that led up to Snowden making this decision and why he chose to do what he did. The film also shows that what Snowden did was certainly not an easy choice and it did bring him many tough decisions and problems that affected his relationships as well as his own health. The whole gamut of why he did what he did and the reasons he had for doing it and what Stone and company consider to be a totally and completely selfless act and that is part of why what he did was in their minds so courageous and why he should be labelled a hero. Watching this fascinating and engrossing account certainly gave me a lot to ponder and think about while watching the film and I do not know if it was just the overall power and effect of the film that got to me, or how absolutely convincing it was in it's overall argument in Snowden's favour, but I have to be honest and say that they make a very valid and true point with this film and this is truly something to be considered and evaluated seriously and maybe what the government was doing was wrong and in this case, perhaps Snowden was truly justified in doing what he did and maybe the label of 'hero' is actually well deserved. The film constructs this case as if it were a prize winning PhD thesis and it truly wins marks for effort and persuasive storytelling while also being convincing and giving every side a fair chance. The screenplay truly accomplishes a lot and is so well constructed and put together that it is one of Stone's best not just lately, but of his whole body of work. The performance here by Joseph Gordon Levitt as Snowden, was one that I found to be a truly interesting performance and character and not just with the different tone of voice that Levitt used, but by humanizing and really allowing us to empathize and support what Snowden was doing. The fact that what he did also cost him a lot adds to this and Levitt's performance truly shows an honourable man with many inner demons and struggles who goes to a lot to achieve what he thinks is right. This is one of the most powerful films of the year and also the most interesting and I encourage everyone who is interested in this case, whether you be for, or against Snowden to give it a shot and I think you will be pleasantly surprised. One of the year's best.",10,5,13,17 September 2016
Woman in Gold," Woman in Gold
","While watching the new film, Woman in Gold, based upon the true life stories of Maria Altmann and Randol Schoenberg, I couldn't help, but think of caparisons and links between this film and last year's The Monuments Men. Both films deal with World War II and recovering art that was stolen by the Nazis during that time. While, The Monuments Men was a bit more of a period piece in some ways, Woman in Gold, flashes back between the past and present, but mostly deals with the present time. I personally enjoyed George Clooney's The Monuments Men, even though the film was anything but embraced by critics, who more, or less called the film a mess. While not my favourite film of last year, or even of George Clooney, I still found a lot to admire and appreciate about that film. Woman in Gold, as I mentioned above, does deal with a very similar subject, only I feel it is more of a personal account of one woman and her lawyer's experience with this than the men who went to recover the art in The Monuments Men. I feel that because, Woman in Gold, is dealing with real people and how they have been affected by the Nazi tragedies of the second World War and how they are now trying in a small way to get a piece of their heritage back, and we see the different emotions as well as the anger and resentment that still met them on their journey to do this, that for this reason alone, I find Woman in Gold, to be a much more personal film than The Monuments Men, and also a better made film in general, while I still did like both films. Unfortunately it seems that a lot of critics are dismissing Woman in Gold, much like they did with The Monuments Men, although this one is getting slightly better reviews than the previous film. I personally found a lot to like here. Helen Mirren, who I have always found to be a really solid actress, delivers another great performance here as Maria Altmann. Mirren's portrayal of her is as a feisty older woman who has seen a lot of tragedy and endured a lot of hardships in her life because of the second World War, but in her own way she is definitely a fighter and is a strong willed and courageous woman and also stubborn in a good way, whereas when she sets her heart and goals on something she will set out to achieve them, even if the situation looks hopeless. I found I cared deeply for this character and her strong willed spirit and also her feistiness was contagious and I could laugh and be amused at her character often as well. It was a great performance of Mirren's that goes along with many of her others. Ryan Reynolds, I have not seen in a lot of films, simply because a lot of what he normally stars in, is not the type of films that I would normally go and see. I have however found that he is getting better with his film choices lately like Adventureland and last year's The Captive. Both films I liked very much. I have never seen, Buried, but heard he was very good in there and that it was probably his strongest performance to date. Having said that, I found that he was excellent here as Randol Schoenberg, Maria's lawyer who eventually turned into her biggest supporter and close friend. At the start of the film, his character is not that interested in taking on Maria's case, but once he decides to do so and reflects on past memories, or what he finds out about his own and also Maria's past with the second World War, he is bound and determined to help her recover what was rightfully hers at any cost, no matter the money, or difficulties they may go through trying to achieve this. His character his certainly strong willed in his own way too and you really warm up to him in the second and third acts of the film and I think his character is just as fascinating and well played as Maria, and Mirren's portrayal of her as well. What makes, Woman in Gold, more than just a pleasing period piece film for two hours is the strong performances by it's two very capable lead actors here as well as the very impressive attention to detail the filmmaking crew used to make this story come to life as well as the fact that this is a really interesting true story and along the way we deeply care for these characters and their mission and really want to see them achieve what at one time seems impossible. The back story of Maria's life growing up during Nazi occupied Austria, to the fight she has in the present day is both equally captivating and riveting in it's own way. Randol's contemporary story is just as good as we see him trying to leave his mark in the world as a lawyer and also trying to raise a new family as well. As, I said before we really get to care for and root for these characters all the way. Overall, this is certainly a crowd pleasing film that will certainly please fans of Mirren, and make new fans of Reynolds and for any history and art lovers as well. A really well done and made picture that is better than what the critics are saying.",9,1,4,20 April 2015
Don't Breathe," Don't Breathe
","Don't Breathe, is a film that I thought within the first little while of watching it was setting itself up for what could be a really interesting horror film, but also one that had something interesting to say as well. Take for example that the film is set in the present time and takes place in Detroit, Michigan. The film shows dilapidated and run down houses and shows an economy that is far from booming and that basically the people who live there are living in shabby conditions and don't have a lot of money, or the best resources to support themselves. This is interesting by itself for the simple and honest fact that just a handful of years ago, Detroit did end up going bankrupt and the city was in dire need of an economic and financial rescue. The film could have really gone somewhere with this and made an interesting social commentary about it such as the fact that the main characters in the film basically support themselves by breaking and entering into houses and selling the goods they receive on the black market. They do this because this is the only way of life and the only way to make cash that they know of and it is their dream to eventually move out of this impoverished community and eventually head to California, where despite droughts and potential earthquakes, the economy is always booming and there are jobs in abundance, or so it seems in the film industry and movies themselves. This could have been an interesting social comment, or just a thoughtful look at how many people in the world are suffering now with little to no money and having to resort to desperate acts in order to take care of themselves. Something else that could have given food for thought, or added some much needed depth to the film was the character of the blind man. While, I am not going to say too much as to not give away any spoilers, I will say that he is a man tormented by inner demons which have all seemed to have befallen him through no fault of his own and now has made him the bitter and twisted person that he is. Things such as loss of loved ones plus the horrors and traumas of war also come into play here. As said earlier, these could have all made for the ingredients of an interesting film and one that has something to say, but unfortunately the film never really does anything with these interesting plot build ups, but instead just lets the film fall into familiar territory and become like so many horror films that we see on the mainstream market nowadays. The sad thing here is that the film is technically well made with excellent direction, cinematography, editing and the acting is better than most horror films these days allow for. I will even credit the film and say that there is certainly a fair bit of tension at least for the first little while of the film and it does have a couple of moments where it leaves the audience in actual fear, or suspense which is a job that is not easily done for horror filmmakers recently. These are all strong points of the film and for the first while the film really captured my interest from the second it started, but the unfortunate thing here again is that the film is basically a game of cat and mouse and even though the film is relatively short in it's running time, the sad thing is it becomes tiresome and I began to lose interest way before the end credits started to roll. Things in the film just kept getting more and more preposterous and hard to believe and it seems like they were just using all the old tricks in the book to keep this film going and trying to be interesting, but by that point I had long stopped caring and I was more, or less just waiting for the film to end, so I could go home again. This is a film that certainly showed potential with items and agendas that could have been really eye opening, but would also make not only a thrilling, but engaging film and yet the filmmakers seemed to have run out of steam early on and not really knew how to conclude this film, or elevate it to any higher levels of quality. While it stands it is far from the worst film of the year and it does have enough merits to it, but there have been better horror films lately and sadly this is far from one of them which makes this film more of a rental, or a television watch than to actually go and sink money into the theatre to see it.",7,4,10,27 August 2016
Sicario," Sicario
","The new film Sicario, is a film that if I had to do my best to describe it, I would definitely call it an experience. It is one of those films where once the film starts, it takes you into it's own world with it's characters and the events going on and you get so engrossed and fascinated by what is going on and at the same time the film affects you deeply and leaves a big impact on you during the duration of the film and also once you have left the theatre. The film is so stylishly done and such an intense film to watch and in regards to this intensity and the suspense that the film generates, it is all because of the amazing directing job of Denis Villeneuve who as we have seen in the past with films like Incendies, shows that Villeneuve really knows how to frame a scene and evokes excellent performances from his cast and with his use of music in a film as well as just how every single frame and shot is stylistically done to perfection is one of the truly great things about this film and this is a film that is quite intense to watch and I mean that in the best way possible. Once it gets a hold of your interest it does not let go for the remainder of the film till the end credits when you are finally able to breathe and to pause and reflect on what you have just watched. The film when I say this is not a horror film and nor is it scary either, but just very suspenseful and intense and as I have said above, is just totally captivating and it sure takes us as an audience on this ride and takes us into it's own whole during the 2 hour running time of the film. The acting here by the whole cast which includes Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro is all superb, but I think of all the performances the one that really stood out for me was Del Toro's. He plays a character who is shrouded in mystery and we only start to learn more about his character and his character's past as the film goes along. His character is certainly ambiguous in a lot of ways, but that is a great thing because whenever you are watching his character Alejandro, you really do not know if this is a good character, or a bad character, or if you should be rooting for him, or as cautious, or as on edge as some of the other people in the film (particularly Emily Blunt) is around him. This is a character we watch with great fascination and at times he can almost be chilling to watch and yet it is such a captivating and unforgettable performance that I think in particular that this character and performance will not soon be forgotten and if I had to give my two cents worth, I would say that Del Toro will definitely be up for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance in the film. The performance is that powerful and that good. Emily Blunt is also very good here as a character who questions constantly what is going on around her and if what the people she is working alongside are doing is ethical, or if they are just making up their own rules at the time. She is a strong character in many ways, but you also see that at times she can be scared and in her own way also quite vulnerable. She was more or less the common sense character in the film who had the morals and gumption behind her, even when others didn't. Josh Brolin's character was cocky, arrogant and definitely full of himself and he was a joy to watch because at times the performance could be quite entertaining and almost humorous to watch. Here he proves again what a good actor he is. The film stylistically as I mentioned earlier is one of the best looking films I have seen this year, or really in any other year also. The cinematography was done by Roger Deakins, who I consider to be one of the best in the business. He has given us so many beautifully shot and haunting and yet beautiful scenes in so many films and here he again does an excellent job. In fact I can not think of when his cinematography was not amazing, but it is here as well and captures the haunting yet almost tragic circumstances the characters are in and some of his nighttime shots are just amazing. The film's musical score by Johann Johannsson, is more of an electronic score, but oh how it suit's the film perfectly and adds to that perfect intensity and suspense that the film needs. He does a great job here as well. Ultimately this is a film with very little character study which would usually bother me, but here it is not a problem as we are so glued to the events and characters we do have and here we have the case where the less we know the better. This is certainly a film experience and one that I was so glad I took and again I hope to revisit this film again some day and be totally captivated by it again. One of the absolute best films of the year.",10,1,8,5 October 2015
The Descent," The Descent
","The Descent is about a group of female friends who travel into the mountains and decide to go on a cave expedition. Once in the cave things seem to not turn out as they had predicted and soon they will be put to the ultimate test in order to stay alive and make it out of the cave. Winner of The British Independent Film Award for Best Director (Neil Marshall) and Best Technical Achievement for the film's editing at The British Independent Film Awards and The Empire Award for Best Horror Film at The Empire Awards. The Descent has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good makeup. The Descent is a film from the United Kingdom and thankfully it was bought by a North American distributor and released here. The film is very tense and has lots of grimy, claustrophobic and scenes that will make anyone a little tense who is scared of heights or tight places. The film is very atmospheric with dripping walls and good cinematography and a good music score to go along with the film's mood and further enhance the tenseness of the film. I liked how these women were well written and they were smart and believable characters unlike most of the dumb and clich√© characters we find in most horror movies. And these characters do their best to survive and they don't do the typical horror movie thing by making stupid moves and regret them later by losing their life. These characters you actually feel for and you can feel and relate to their fear and quest for survival. The film is set in a cave for the entire movie, but not once does it get boring or tedious. Once this film grabs you it takes you on a ride and won't let go easily. The writing here is very sharp with well written characters and an unpredictable and suspenseful film that really does keep you thrilled the entire length of the movie. The film also looks great and because of it's atmosphere and look it makes the settings all the more real and because a lot of the film is in the dark it adds to the mystery and suspense of the film. I was very entertained by this movie and it also did it's job of keeping me on the edge of my seat and pretty tense throughout the whole 99 minute running time. This film is vastly superior to almost all of the recent horror movies (with a few exceptions such as The Devil's Rejects), but this film is very special because it doesn't rely on a big budget to scare you and it doesn't go overboard with it's music or gore. These are real people in terrifying situations and because of how real and claustrophobic director/writer Neil Marshall makes the scenes we feel pretty much what the characters feel which is a feeling of dread. This film was very powerful and one of the best horror films in a long time. This film will be looked back upon in years to come as a great addition to the horror genre and in several years it will become a classic that will be rented numerous times for Halloween get parties and just times when you and your friends want to watch a scary movie that delivers the goods. The Descent works on all levels that a great horror film should work on and I'm glad to say that I really liked this film and it is one of the best films of the year and one of the best horror films in a long time. Also, I would like to thank the distributor for picking up this film and releasing it in North America and the marketing for this movie was great and thankfully gives away virtually nothing from this movie, so all the suspense is for you to experience when you see this for the first time which I hope you the reader will do.",9,0,1,5 August 2006
Three Colors: Blue," Blue
","Blue is a Polish film in French, Polish and Romanian with English subtitles. The film is about a woman named Julie who survives a car accident while her husband and daughter were killed. Julie tries to start life again on her own in an apartment in Paris. Along the way Julie discovers things she did not know about her husband and she has to come to terms with her life now that her husband and daughter are gone. Winner of The CEC Award for Best Foreign Film at The Cinema Writers Circle Awards; The Cesar Award for Best Actress (Juliette Binoche who plays Julie), Best Editing and Best Sound at The Cesar Awards; The Goya Award for Best European Film at The Goya Awards; The Guild Film Award Gold for Foreign Film at The Guild of German Art House Cinemas; The Silver Ribbon for Best Female Dubbing at The Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists; The LAFCA Award for Best Music at The Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards; The Sant Jordi Award for Best Foreign Actress and Best Foreign Film at The Sant Jordi Awards and The Golden Lion (for director and co-writer Krzysztof Kieslowski), The Golden Osella for Best Cinematography and The Volpi Cup for Best Actress at The Venice Film Festival. The film has good direction, a good script, a good performance by Juliette Binoche, good original music, good film editing and good cinematography. The film's director and co-writer Krzysztof Kieslowski made this film in a trilogy of films he called the Three Colors trilogy which is followed by the films White and Red. Blue is a quiet and small film in many ways. There is not a lot of dialogue in the film and the general story is relatively simple when you first view the film, but after viewing it you will later think about it for awhile and have some questions about it. The movie is good looking and I think Juliette Binoche did a very good job expressing her emotions just by her facial expressions and mannerisms instead of using talking seeing as there isn't a lot of that in the film. The film also has a beautiful yet haunting look to it which is very artistic and stylish. Although the film is a little slow moving I was never bored with it and as it moved on I grew more and more curious about the Julie character and I really wanted to see what would happen with her at the end. There is also some neat twists and unpredictable scenes in here that I thought worked quite well too. I must also commend the film for it's great character study of Julie, a woman who is grieving and is also in a state of self discovery. The film is a small and quiet film but it is fascinating and neat to look at and also is quite a thought provoking and intelligent film.",8,1,2,18 December 2005
The Departed," The Departed
","The Departed is an Americanized version of the Internal Affairs trilogy from Hong Kong. The film is about a young man named Billy Costigan who is assigned by the police to go undercover and be a part of the Irish mafia and do whatever their leader Frank Costello tells him to do. The police are trying to crack down on Frank and they figure if Billy gets enough information on him that he can lead them to him and they can make an arrest. Meanwhile another cop named Colin Sullivan is trying to help the police crack down on Frank as well, but little do they know that he has been a long time friend of Frank and whenever they come close to catching him Colin always tips him off, so he doesn't get caught. Frank soon starts to realize that he has a traitor among his men and tries to find out who that is and the police know that one of their men is tipping off Frank and they try and find out who that is. The rest of the film is a cat and mouse game of who ends out and top and who gets caught or not. The Departed has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The Departed is a smart film that has a good story and lots of neat twists and turns and you never know how the film is going to end. I thought everyone behind the camera and on screen did a great job and the story kept my interest and entertained me and kept me in suspense wondering what would happen to these characters. The conversations between these characters are very well written and the dialogue between them is very good as well. The film has a nice stylish look and at times also looks gritty which helps give the film the needed edge and feel that it needs. There are a lot of interesting things in this story and while the movie does involve several characters it never complicates the story by throwing in unnecessary side plots or other things involving the characters and when it does it all works well. This film is pulled off very nicely by it's cast and great director Martin Scorsese. For being an unpredictable, compelling and well made film that packs a powerful punch especially in it's last half I would say that The Departed is one of the best films of the year and another great film for Martin Scorsese's film r√©sum√©.",10,0,0,14 October 2006
The Witch," The Witch
","Back in the year 2000, I had the pleasure of seeing the director's cut and re release of The Exorcist on the big screen at my local theatre. This was such a thrill for me as I was not around in 1973 to see the film when it was first released in theatres and now having a chance to see not only one of my favourite horror films, but one of my favourite films of all time on the big screen was an experience that I was to savour and that was a great all around film experience for me. Overall as I mentioned, seeing the film on the big screen in stereo sound and with additional unseen footage was great. I also thought that being able to see and experience the film with a then live audience full of people who perhaps had never seen the film before as well as fans of it probably who even saw it back in the 70's would be a real treat, but unfortunately seeing it with a live audience was one of the drawbacks of the film. All the then teenage viewers who were in the film audience amongst me, were instead of being in fear, or absolutely captivated by the film as they should have been, they were instead laughing and mocking the film as if what they saw on the screen was one of the funniest things they had ever seen. I was completely in disbelief and truly was despairing of this generation of moviegoers, even if I unfortunately fall into that same age group and demographic. I mention this in this review of the new film, The Witch, because the exact same thing happened to me while I was watching this film with a live audience who typically fell in the teenage age bracket as well. People were not only laughing and sneering at the film as if this was the funniest film to come along in quite awhile, but they also mocked it, were squirming in their chairs with boredom and countless times various people of the audience would leave and then come back into the theatre which each time caused the heavy theatre door to make a large slamming sound as they would enter and then exit the theatre and this happened frequently throughout the film. I think in both cases with The Exorcist, and now with The Witch, both films are very good, but the proof shows that they go beyond the typical maturity level of a teenage audience and those who attended my screening. The Witch, is a smart film with sparse and bare settings and backdrops that reminded me of the European films of Bergman, Tarkovsky and even Lars Von Trier's last few films in his depression type trilogy with Antichrist and Melancholia being the main examples. The acting was all by people who were relatively unknown to me as was the director and most of the crew if I have to be honest about it, but their dedication and craft on this film was excellent and this ended up being one of the most effective and interesting horror films of recent years. There certainly were moments in the film that were almost baffling, ludicrous and even hard to understand at times, but I at least was so compelled and interested by what was going on that even the more bizarre aspects of the film were intriguing to me as opposed to being something that bothered me about it. The film is getting rave reviews from critics and for good and appropriate reasons because technically it is one of the best made horror films from an artistic standpoint as well as any serious fan of the genre can tell you how effective and thought provoking this experience was. The people in my theatre like the people almost 16 years ago who laughed and mocked The Exorcist, are from a generation who like their horror films violent and with loud, annoying and sometimes just plain idiotic jump scares and stuff that most of us would just avoid, or roll our eyes at if we saw. Too bad that all these years later that today's teens are still enjoying the same old garbage and are totally aloof to anything of any artistic merit such as the two films in question. With time we will see how these films continue to fair, but I have a suspicion that critics and horror fans will be on my side and these teens will eventually grow up and their past tastes will be left in the dust. Time will certainly tell.",9,0,4,20 February 2016
The Holiday," The Holiday
","The Holiday is about two women who each have recently had problems with the men in their lives. Amanda lives in California and Iris lives in England. Neither of these women have ever met before, but they both want to escape for the holidays, so they talk online and decide to swap houses and automobiles for two weeks, so in other words Amanda would be staying at Iris's house in England and Iris would be staying at Amanda's house in California. Once they both reach their destinations they are both pretty bitter about men, but each of them soon meets different men in their lives who mean a lot to them and may make their holiday something to remember. The Holiday has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast and good original music. At first I wasn't really getting into this film and thought it would be a film that would probably appeal more to a woman than to me. Also the Amanda character played by Cameron Diaz annoyed me at first and I found her kind of artificial and ego centric. However as the film played on I found myself really liking this film. The characters grew on me and I found quite a bit to like about this movie. The chemistry between all the different characters works very well and their parts are all quite well written and the actors playing them each do a good job. I found that the film also developed and showed a lot about these characters which I enjoyed because the more I got to know about them the more I liked them and they were able to grow on me more. Each character in this film brings something unique to the table by being different and by really making this film more interesting than perhaps it sounds. The really rewarding thing about this film is how well the characters work with one another and that they are well written and well acted. This film is a romantic comedy and for the most part a lot of romantic comedies do not do a whole lot for me because I find them silly and more for the female viewer than the male viewer, but this movie offers a lot of humour, heart and is just generally a pleasant feel good film that I think both male and female viewers will enjoy. One of the better films of the year and one of the better romantic comedies of recent years as well.",8,130,190,2 December 2006
Steve Jobs," Steve Jobs
","One of the best descriptions I have read of the new film, Steve Jobs, is that it is like a play, or an opera done in four different parts. In describing this, I will not be giving away anything about the film, but may instead draw more interest on your behalf to the film, or perhaps just the opposite. The film is written by Aaron Sorkin (who wrote the brilliant screenplay to 2010's The Social Network) and based upon the book by Walter Isaacson. The film is divided up into four different parts and as earlier described, this is like watching a play, or an opera because each of these segments of the film is for the most part, consisting of only a couple of characters and actors on set at a time (there may be some lingering in the background to fill out the scene), but generally the main action and dialogue in each of these sections consists of back and forth dialogue between Michael Fassbender (who plays Steve Jobs) and any number of the various supporting actors and characters that go along with this true story. Each scene is set up as a play, or opera and ultimately plays out that way as well. This is a film with no action, no special effects, or anything like that, so for those seeking that, they better look elsewhere. Instead we get these brilliantly set up scenes with Aaron Sorkin's top notch dialogue and each of these great actors and actresses interacting with each other and with the fantastic writing and lines they are delivering, this is pure movie-making for any fan of the craft and an absolute joy and pleasure to watch. No action is needed in this film because Sorkin's dialogue and script is so good that he manages to cover a good part of Jobs' life and what was going on around him into these four parts of the movie using these great actors and instead of showing the action it is all described to you in detail with the great back and forth dialogue between the actors. I know that to a lot of you, the idea of watching a couple of people in one room, just basically talking back and forth between each other for the duration of the movie must sound like pure torture and like something that would be painful and extremely boring to sit through. These people couldn't be more wrong. Steve Jobs is so fascinating to watch because of the great writing and dialogue between the characters and each of these actors and actresses so brilliantly get into these roles and can debate and recite these lines as if they went to the top acting and debating schools because the lines and the performances are pulled off so flawlessly here. The film also showcases Jobs' life through dialogue and we see him at various stages in his life focusing on his business enterprises, his relationships with those around him including coworkers and an estranged wife and daughter as well as how in many ways he was a ruthless business man who had a vision and would stop at nothing, or no one to achieve what he truly thought was best for his product, company and stock shareholders. Something that is no doubt going to pop into the minds of many people watching this film is why there was made a film of a man like Steve Jobs, who perhaps in many ways isolated himself away from family and the affections and considerations of others only to become extremely wealthy and looking after his own self? A lot of people may be against Jobs the person and the movie made about him because of this. Even for those who are anti business and anti capitalist, there is still a message here and a great story to be told and without giving anything away, the film does show some tenderness on Jobs' part and doesn't demonize the man, but instead does what any decent and accurate portrayal would do, and that is to make him human. Sure, there are things that we may be turned off about regarding Jobs and his treatment of his coworkers and business partners and right down to his own wife and daughter, but when we really look at the film we do see that there is a tenderness as I mentioned above in the mind and behaviour of Jobs and that is something that is explored throughout the film and by the end of the movie I think that is clearly seen and understood. As well as his icy coldness towards others and his ruthlessness in the business world, whereas I might not have taken the same route as him if I were in that position and you may argue that you wouldn't have either, you still have to be impressed at him as being the conductor behind the massive orchestra and business that Apple became and no matter what Jobs was like as a person, you have to acknowledge that he did know what he was doing, what he wanted and how he was going to achieve it. Plus, I am sure many of you reading this are operators of such Apple products and may be even using them now while you are reading this. Ultimately this version of Steve Jobs is filled with top notch writing, brilliant performances and excellent direction in a film that is both fascinating, in some ways a cautious tale, but all the same one that is totally human and honest and for that it is a masterpiece.",10,1,5,25 October 2015
12 Years a Slave," 12 Years a Slave
","Steve McQueen's masterful, 12 Years a Slave, is one of the most hard hitting and powerful films that I have ever seen. The film is brutal in it's depictions of slavery and the unjust treatment and attitudes that were directed towards African Americans at that time. The film, which is based on a true story, is a film of tremendous artistic merit and also when you watch the film and leave the theatre, it leaves a profound effect on you. After the film was done and I was watching the end credits roll, I felt a lump in my throat and my eyes were beginning to irritate me because they were becoming watery and deep down inside my body and my soul, I knew that I had just seen an excellent and undoubtedly accurate depicture of mankind at one of it's lowest and most unforgivable times. I hated watching these slave landowners in the film and I felt deep down in my heart, both empathy and pity for the way these characters were treated by these racist and evil men. The film hit home in such a way that after I left the theatre, I was quiet for quite some time both getting over emotionally, what I had just saw and witnessed, but also the feeling the film left me with which was as I mentioned a feeling of horror and disgust and also a sense of awe and sheer appreciation towards filmmaker Steve McQueen and his wonderful cast and crew for creating a film based on facts and bringing it to be so lifelike and realistic that the film left a profound impact on me and left me with a lot to think about afterwards. Yes, the film is brutal in it's depiction of what these slaves go through and at times it can be extremely hard to watch because the film does not shy away from the brutality, mistreatment and torture that these slaves went through. It can be hard to watch, but at the same time, I felt the decision the filmmakers chose, to show the film in that intense detail was what added to the film's power and the overall effect it left on me. I know that unfortunately some may shy away and decide not to see the film for that very reason, but I strongly urge those viewers to reconsider, because 12 Years a Slave, is a film that I honestly think that everybody should see. It's important to see because of the injustice and poor treatment that is basically a part of our history and a part of history that should not be forgotten, or ignored. At the same time it presents an unpleasant and harsh look at American history, it also shows that in some ways things have improved over a span of several hundred years. Right now America, has their first African American President of the United States of America. Whether you are a fan of Barack Obama's policies, or not, is not important here. What is important is that as a people we have come forward a little bit. Something like that would not have even been dreamed of in the days of slavery, or even the racist attitudes going through the 1950's and 60's, but I think we are on the right path in a way. Unfortunately though, you will still have people who are set in their closed minded and bigoted ways who through their own learning and behaviour, still harbour racist attitudes. I know I have met and heard of people like that and I think that we all know that it still exists. These are some reasons I am still glad that 12 Years a Slave was made. It was a powerful portrait of one man's hellish journey through slavery and the many others he met while there as well. The film boasts an incredible cast who all deliver top notch and Oscar caliber performances. The screenplay is excellent by both drawing us in and keeping us glued to our seats and by invoking power, feelings and thought through it as well. The cinematography was beautiful and Steve McQueen's direction paid much attention to detail and helped further the message I think the film was trying to leave on the audience. I also liked how the film did not use bombastic music, or fake sentimentality to make us cry, or to get the emotional feelings across to the viewer. I felt the way I did at the end of the film and during it because the film made me care for these characters because these events actually went on and seeing them in their brutality and allowing us to care for these characters and the injustice they went through, hits home in a way that my writing could not do justice to. Let me just say that this, as I mentioned above, is one of the most powerful and emotionally overwhelming films I have ever seen. There are still a lot of 2013 films that I haven't seen and still need to see, but as it stands now, the one that should be taking home Oscar gold next year is clearly and undoubtedly in my mind, 12 Years a Slave. Don't miss it while it is still in theatres. One of the best films of 2013 and one of the most powerful and moving films of all time.",10,2,5,1 December 2013

They go to weddings pretending to be related to someone there and hope they can pick up girls. They have done this many times before and the next wedding they crash is of a daughter of a treasury secretary where the two best friends pose as brothers. While at the wedding John meets his daughter named Claire Cleary, and John starts to fall in love with her. Another of the treasure secretary's daughters named Gloria, falls in love with Jeremy. Gloria convinces her dad to let them come and stay with them for awhile at their summer home. John, and Claire really seem to hit it off but she has a mean boyfriend who she may be getting married to soon. And, Jeremy finds Gloria kind of weird and in some ways wants nothing to do with her. Many conflicts arise and so does the humour as the two best friends pose as people they are not and try to not get caught as well as John, trying to woo Claire, and Jeremy trying to stay away from Gloria, and some other members of the very odd family. Wedding Crashers, has good direction, a good script, good comedic performances by Owen Wilson (who plays John Beckwith) and Vince Vaughn (who plays Jeremy Klein) as well as a good supporting cast, good original music and good cinematography. Next to Batman Begins, this film is the second biggest surprise of the year so far. I loved this film. Wedding Crashers, has great chemistry and good comedic performances by both Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn which really make the film work, some smart writing and it is an amusing, charming, fun, entertaining, sweet, enjoyable and everything you could want in a comedy that comes out just perfect. The film makes you laugh, is sweet and a lot of fun too. One of the best comedies I have seen in awhile and also one of the best films of the year so far.",10,1,7,18 July 2005
There Will Be Blood," There Will Be Blood
","There Will Be Blood is based upon the novel Oil by author Upton Sinclair. The film takes place in the late 1800's and moves into the 1900's and is about a silver prospector named Daniel Plainview who discovers oil which leads him to great riches and gives him power when he starts his own oil drilling companies. Daniel is approached by a young man who takes him to his family's property and land where Daniel soon discovers that it has tons of oil under the ground, so he sets up a place to live and starts drilling for more profits. During the film we are also shown the relationship between Daniel and his young son H.W. and how the profits he is making soon start to turn him from an honest hard working man into someone that is soon unrecognizable and the film shows his descent into this character and how he his changed because of this. There Will Be Blood is more of a look at the character of Daniel and what makes him who he is and why he does what he does and he is brilliantly played by actor Daniel Day-Lewis and is written so perfectly that we really get an in depth look at the character and what is going on in his mind. The film's story is mostly a look at Daniel and the different people he interacts with, but mostly it is a look at him and the story is told in an epic way because of the dynamic presence and portrayal by Daniel Day-Lewis and the strong writing of Daniel's personality and dialogue. The film is also one of the best looking films I have seen in quite awhile with gorgeous cinematography and great sets, costumes and a wonderful musical score as well. In many ways There Will Be Blood is an epic film because it is a period piece movie and it is a little longer with it's running time, but in that time, so much stuff is going on and no scene feels wasted, or unnecessary because every moment we spend with Daniel drives us deeper and deeper into his character and because he is such a fascinating character from start to finish that he really makes the film a compelling watch and because he is such a layered character with so much going on in his mind that he becomes completely human and his descent into greed and power and perhaps even loneliness and remorse is all the more interesting because of the great script and acting performance that really propels this character onto the screen. The film didn't drag much with it's longer running time and there was so much to appreciate here with the gorgeous look and feel of the film to it's thought provoking and involving story and performances that really make this film a unique and all too hauntingly real portrayal of this sort of situation where one is driven by man made evils. One of the best looking films I have ever seen and one of the best character films as well. There Will Be Blood stands out because of it's excellent work in front of and behind the camera and makes for a truly compelling and interesting watch and is even more so because it is really unlike any film I have seen before and I mean that in the best way possible. One of last year's best achievements and best films.",10,3,7,2 February 2008
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Wolf of Wall Street
","The Wolf of Wall Street, which is Martin Scorsese's new film based supposedly on a true story and book by Jordan Belfort, is not only the single worst film I have seen in 2013 so far, but it is also one of the worst films that I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. The film sounded interesting enough as I have an interest in wall street and the business world and more times than not I have enjoyed Martin Scorsese's films and Leonardo DiCaprio as well as their collaborations together, but this film just did not work. First off, I think that this is one of the most vulgar and profane films that I have ever seen. I would actually be curious to know how many profanities were uttered during the course of this film because it must have been an awful lot because there was barely a minute that went by without someone cursing. Besides the filthy language and lots of it, the film showed the lifestyles these characters lived and showed in graphic detail all the immoral and perverse things that they were up to. Basically this was the whole of the film, showing a bunch of spoiled an arrogant rich people behaving badly with no real message, or anything to wrap the film up with. The film was just endless excess and then some. I have seen a lot of films over the years including some that have objectionable content of varying degrees and styles and usually unless it is done in a certain way, I do not let it bother me, but for The Wolf of Wall Street, it felt like there was no point to it and the whole objective of this film was to be loud, crude, rude and vulgar. To be honest I am shocked the film did not receive an NC-17 rating. I guess I was not the only person to have felt this way because people actually left during the screening I was in for this movie and I read that during an official screening of the film with cast and crew, someone actually went up to Scorsese and said 'Shame on you!'. I wish I could have said the same thing right to his face. This is the type of film that I absolutely hated so much that I wish my friend, who very kindly paid for the tickets for the movie, would have asked for his money back because this film was almost 3 hours of my life that I will never get back, 3 hours I could have spent doing something better, or seeing a much better film. I am personally really surprised at the high ratings the film is getting and also all the awards nominations as well. Did they see the same film I did? To me though, there was nothing that made this film special at all. Every single character was loathsome, so to say I admired the acting would be hard for me to say, seeing as I did not care about any of these characters and after awhile they got on my nerves and I just wanted the film to be over. The film's screenplay was just excessive bad behaviour and wild living with no moral, or point to it, other than just showing it and going as far as they can with the content and hoping that the audience has a wild and fun time with it, which I didn't. Also the film was way too long. At almost 3 hours in length sitting through this monotonous and vulgar bore was actually painful. I sat and squirmed in my seat and wished for better lighting in the theatre, so that I could check my watch to get a rough idea of when this piece of trash would be over. Alas, I sat patiently and this film would just not end. The editing was all over the place and there were scenes in this film that had no point of being in there and others just went on for way too long. The film is being classified as a comedy, but I do not think I laughed once. Often it's attempt at humour, or trying to make me laugh was just scenes that I found awkwardly executed and filmed and they looked clumsy and poorly done. The whole film felt like it was made during a college fraternity party and written and made after everybody had probably way too much to drink. This is certainly a major disgrace for Martin Scorsese, the man behind such classics as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. I didn't think with all his talent that he could make a film this bad, but he proved me wrong. Unfortunately, people are going to go and see this film and probably kick a big kick out of it for all the wrong reasons. I will certainly throw a fit if this wins any major awards over much better and deserving films this year though. As it stands, The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that I hope to never see ever again in my whole life and it was a rare occasion where I saw a film where I wanted a complete refund from the theatre chain. The absolute worst film of 2013 and don't make the same mistake I did by paying, or sitting through it.",1,37,74,30 December 2013

","The Last King Of Scotland is based upon the novel of the same name by Giles Foden. The film takes pace in the 1970's and is about a young doctor from Scotland named Nicholas Garrigan who decides to travel to Uganda to become a doctor there. After being set up with one or two other doctors in Uganda, Nicholas meets the new president of Uganda named Idi Amin. Amin is quite taken by Nicholas, so he decides to make him his own personal physician and moves him to a bigger hospital. Nicholas and Amin also become quite friendly and Amin seems to have a real soft spot in his heart for Nicholas and he sort of takes him under his wing while at the same time often coming to Nicholas for help for medical reasons and advice for the country. Soon, Nicholas sees that Idi isn't always just fun and laughter and that he has a dark side which later resulted in hundreds of thousands of people being murdered in Uganda causing Idi Amin to go into exile until his death in 2003. The Last King Of Scotland is the winner of 22 awards including the Oscar for Best Actor (Forest Whitaker who played Idi Amin). I thought this film was a masterpiece from start to finish and certainly one of the best films of 2006. The film is directed with great skill, has a good script, good cinematography and good film editing. Don't think I've forgotten about the acting because that is one of the things that makes this movie so great. Forest Whitaker completely transforms into Idi Amin and totally owns this character and at times makes him seem jolly and fun to sometimes downright frightening and menacing. Everything from Whitaker's facial expressions, body language and right up to the way he portrays this character is brilliant and is very worthy of the Oscar for Best Actor. James McAvoy who plays Nicholas also does a great job here and I think he was very overlooked when the award season hit. What could have been a long and political movie turns out to be a film that is more about characters, their personalities and what is going on in their minds. The character development and study of this film is great and the characters are brought to life by the great acting, script and direction. This is also a good looking movie and is immensely entertaining, at times thrilling and always compelling right up until the end. This is a powerful and engrossing film which has lots of talent behind the camera and right in front of it. I liked how the movie went more for the characters than the political stuff and although he was called a brutal murderer I liked how also the film gave Amin a more human side because it made him all the more real and believable. This is a towering achievement in film that sets the bar from acting to directing and is one of the best films of 2006.",10,1,2,3 March 2007
American Gangster," American Gangster
","American Gangster is based on the true story of Frank Lucas, who became rich and powerful after he started smuggling heroin into the country from Vietnam on planes returning from the Vietnam war. A detective named Richie Roberts, starts to investigate Frank and soon starts to gather enough evidence to eventually bring him and his drug empire down. American Gangster is an impressive film for many reasons. For starters the film has a very intelligent and well written script that is perfectly carried out by the acting cast as well as the film's director. The attention to detail and capturing the mood, music and just the era of the late 60's and early 70's was also well done I thought. The film is longer in length, but I found it to be a truly engrossing and captivating picture that I did not once find it boring or slow at all. I found the pacing to be just right to have enough of a character study going on, but also enough to keep us interested and entertained. The editing and stylish behind the scenes camera work by director Ridley Scott, I also appreciated as well as the very powerful and believable performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe who play the two main leads. There have been a lot of different gangster films over the years and while this one could have been unoriginal and nothing new compared to a film like Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas, I felt that there was enough here to make this it's own movie without having to borrow ideas or formulas from other films that are similar in story and genre. This was a fairly original and captivating story which probably is helped by the fact that it is a true story and an interesting one at that. To capture the mood and era of when this all happened I give a big thanks to the film's screenwriter as well as Ridley Scott once again. Like I said earlier I was engrossed and captivated by this film and it never once stopped interesting and entertaining me. The film is more than a piece of entertainment helped by a great cast and crew who all do their best work here which is actually award worthy stuff and I wouldn't be surprised if this film did eventually get nominated for something in the next couple of months. This was an original and well done film that was engrossing and had a terrific pace to it helped by a great cast and crew that make this an award worthy film.",10,0,6,3 November 2007
The Wrestler," The Wrestler
","The Wrestler is about a middle age man named Randy Robinson, who for the past twenty, or so years, has made a living as a professional wrestler. He used to be at the top of his game and considered one of the best, but now as he is encountering health problems and aging, Randy is still good, but doesn't always get the same breaks as he once did career wise. We see Randy struggling to make ends meet and taking up other work in order to bring more money in and we also see him reach out and try to connect with people, all the while also not being able to change from the hard lifestyle he has lived for quite some time now, including alcohol, drugs and a lot of wear and tear on his body. Randy must now choose what is most important to him in life and how he is to accomplish those things and stay true to his promises as well as becoming healthier and getting rid of his own personal demons and trying to get his once promising career and life back. The Wrestler completely blew me away when I saw it. I thought Mickey Rourke's performance as Randy was nothing short of brilliant because of the way he went all out for this role and just the emotion that pours through almost every scene he is in. It's a brilliant performance and one worthy of all the awards it is getting. The supporting performances by Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood are very good as well. I like how the film's director shot the film in a very gritty and realistic style approach making everything look all the more real, drab and depressing. This is not a fancy bells and whistles film, it is just raw and honest, much like the characters and the story. I for one really appreciated this style of direction and thought that it suited the film beautifully. The story for me was captivating from the first frame of the film to the last. The characters are so well developed and we learn so much about them in the two hours we are watching them, that you could swear you have known them for an eternity. The way the film shows the character's flaws and weaknesses only adds to the great character study by showing these characters as who they really are and not sugar coating anything. At times we can feel sorry for these characters, hate them and even have some pity for them. All of this is perfected by a great original screenplay and the great performances that go along with it. The wrestling scenes themselves are brutally violent, but the way they are set up are fascinating to watch and the way the cast and crew pulled them off is also applaud worthy. I liked how the film showed a darker side to human nature and showed us characters and lifestyles that most people might normally look away from, but here in this film they are brought out in front and in focus and while you the viewer may still not agree with these characters, or what they are doing, the way they live or perhaps damage their lives is heartbreaking to watch and you literally can not look away while this is going on. This is a very powerful movie that is brutally honest and I mean that in the best way possible. The film also leaves you with a lot of emotions and some scenes will definitely stay with you long after the movie. What a rewarding experience it was to see such a brilliant piece of art like this. One of 2008's best films (if not the best film of that year) and also one of the best of the past 10 years, or so. If a theatre near you has still not gotten The Wrestler be sure to e-mail your local theatre chains and nag them until they get it because this is just great stuff to behold and deserves to be seen.",10,0,1,21 February 2009
Dark Shadows," Dark Shadows
","Dark Shadows is based on the television series of the same name by Dan Curtis. For those who have never seen, or heard of the Dark Shadows television series, it was a Gothic soap opera that ran from 1966 to 1971. It was followed by the films House of Dark Shadows as well as Night of Dark Shadows and was remade into a television series again in 1991 and a television movie in 2005. Now we have this new theatrical movie version based on the television series which is directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp among it's quite impressive cast. Before seeing this 2012 movie version of Dark Shadows, I had never previously seen the different television shows, or movies that it was based on. I remember seeing the original series from the late 60's on in reruns on some specialty station on television, but I never saw more than a few minutes of it, so I walked into this new movie version not knowing too much about the plot, or back story from the previous films or television series. Also because I have never seen the originals I can not compare this new version to them either. From what I gather the original was done in more of a slow paced style and played out more melodramatically like soap operas usually do. This film version does do a bit of that, but I think unlike the series and movies, this version also incorporates humour into the story as well. This new version of Dark Shadows did not really get good reviews at all. I remember reading numerous bad reviews from critics and even average movie goers who were posting their blogs, or reviews of it online, and did not seem to like it. I fall into another category then because I absolutely loved the film. The fact that it was a Gothic horror costume drama that takes place in the early 1970's mixing the music, dress and culture of that era plus the more macabre events going on as well as some pretty humorous scenes as well, I found myself really enjoying it. For one thing, I really liked the atmosphere and look of the film. With it's great cinematography and visuals the film looked very good and quite appropriate to showing a castle from hundreds of years ago, plus the way they put in elements of the 1970's I felt worked very well and added more fascination and humour to the film as well. The performances from the entire cast were very good. After, I had thought about the film some more, I think I appreciated the performances even more because the actors had to be over the top and melodramatic when delivering their lines, but also do it in such a way as to be believable and realistic. It wasn't the type of melodramatic performances from say Hollywood movies of the 1940's, or 50's that I usually have a problem with. Often, I find that those performances from the older films do not hold up that well compared to today's movies and acting because they often feel dated and the performances lack emotion, or any shred of believability, or realism. It often felt very forced and over done whereas the acting in Dark Shadows does not and I would have to say that the performers do quite a good job and it is a very talented cast. The story to the film I found very compelling and fascinating. It required elements of the macabre and Gothic horror which I found to be fascinating and intriguing and I found that most of the humour that went along with it worked really well also. There were quite a few times when there was a certain line, or moment in the film that put a smile on my face mostly because of the good delivery and performances of the actors. The film managed to be dark and creepy, but never actually scaring, or disturbing us, or going over the top with violence, or gore. The film is fairly over the top in it's storytelling style, but it never took the easy way out by using expensive special effects and lots of gore. Instead it focuses on a well put together story that drew me in and captured my interest to the end. I was enjoying this film so much and found it so entertaining that afterwards I thought to myself about what critics did not like about it. Perhaps they just did not get it. I found everything worked together so well and was put on by a marvelously talented cast and crew that I never did find much faults, or criticisms about the film. Instead, I found it entertaining from start to finish and it really fascinated me with it's original and fascinating storytelling and it's unique delivering of how it went about telling us this story. I loved the acting, music, scenery and pretty much everything about the film. I know I am going to receive a lot of flack about this, but I would have to say that I loved Dark Shadows. Every minute of it and I am not ashamed to admit that. This film as it seems is certainly not for everyone, but I for one adored it because of it's sheer entertainment and fun.",10,7,16,14 May 2012
Ray," Ray
","Ray, is based on the true story of Ray Charles, the blind African American musician. The film shows us clips of Ray's childhood and how he witnessed his brother drown in a washtub and that by the age of seven he lost all sight completely. The rest of the film shows Ray's rise to the top with his music career and it also shows his rocky marriage with his wife and his addiction to heroin and other women before he went to rehab and later quit and has become one of the most popular and well known soul musicians of all time. Winner of The BAFTA Film Award for Best Performance By An Actor In A Leading Role (Jamie Foxx, who plays Ray Charles) and Best Sound at The BAFTA Awards, The BSFC Award for Best Actor at The Boston Society Of Film Critics Awards, The BFCA Award for Best Actor and Best Soundtrack at The Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, The FFCC Award for Best Actor at The Florida Film Critics Circle Awards, The Golden Globe Award for Best Performance By An Actor In A Motion Picture Musical Or Comedy, The Golden Satellite Award for Best Actor In A Motion Picture Comedy Or Musical, Best Actress In A Supporting Role Comedy Or Musical (Regina King, who plays Margie Hendricks, who one Ray's band members who he has an affair with) and Best Original Screenplay at The Golden Satellite Awards, The KCFCC Award for Best Actor at The Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards, The Sierra Award for Best Actor at The Las Vegas Film Critics Society Awards, The ALFS Award for Actor Of The Year at The London Critics Circle Film Awards, The NBR Award for Best Actor at The National Board Of Review, The NSFC Award for Best Actor at The National Society Of Film Critics Awards, The PFCS Award for Best Performance By An Actor In A Leading Role and Best Use Of Published Or Recorded Music at The Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards, The Actor Award for Outstanding Performance By A Male Actor In A Leading Role at The Screen Actors Guild, The Seattle Film Critics Award for Best Actor at The Seattle Film Critics Awards, The SEFCA Award for Best Actor at The Southeastern Film Critics Association Awards and The The VFCC Award for Best Actor at The Vancouver Film Critics Circle. Ray, has good direction, a good script, good performances by everyone involved (I will be shocked if Jamie Foxx, does not get the Oscar for Best Actor), good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, and good costume design. A film version of Ray, has actually been planned for close to 20 years but the reason it hasn't been done until now is funding. Ray, took quite awhile for me to get into it and was a little slow starting off and I think I would of preferred if things were shown in chronological order instead of flashbacks but I enjoyed the film nonetheless. The film is well made in basically every way and the film is compelling and interested and is a good portrayal of the life of Ray Charles. I probably would have appreciated it a little more though if the screenplay was worked around with a little better but still a good film.",8,1,2,15 February 2005
Inception," Inception
","Walking into the new science fiction film Inception, I was really not sure what I was going to think of it, or if I was going to like it at all. I had seen many reviews for the film on the internet and although most of the reviews said the film was great and had endless praise for it, there were a few negative reviews that I read, that got me a bit concerned. Overall, I think I was worried about being stuck in an almost two and a half hour movie that was not going to make sense and would be really heavy on special effects and overblown action sequences. Well, once I ended up seeing the film and thinking about it, I was sort of right, and also sort of wrong about the film. To dissect the film easily, I would have to say that the first part of the film, I absolutely hated. In the first half I found the logic, or what they were trying to pass as logic and the basic synopsis, or plot of the film was ambiguous and really not going anywhere for me. I was not sure exactly what was going on and I felt the film did not give me a chance as a viewer to understand, or even care about the people and events going on in front of me. Everything was so out of order and chaotic and there was no ounce of character or plot development anywhere to be found. What, I was watching for the first half of the film were characters mumbling about riddles and the dream world and your subconscious and it was neither intriguing, helpful to the story, or entertaining. There was also a lot of special effects and visual gags and scenes in the first half, that kind of looked neat for a few seconds, but then I found myself getting bored with it. The first half of the film where they are just forcing us to try and accept and have some sort of fun with this preposterous and ambiguous logic they have in this film, I found to be absolutely boring as well as the eye candy and special effects scenes. Several times I glanced over at my watch in a dark theatre and was able to make out the time and hoping that the film was moving faster according to my watch than what I was observing because I could have easily have fallen asleep anywhere at this point. In other words this was the first half of the film and I hated it and could not wait for it to be over. Then to my surprise, the film actually got better, a lot better. We soon got to know more about the main characters in the film and one in particular about his past and the demons he has been haunted by in both his dreaming and waking life. I found this to be interesting and fascinating. As the film moved along in this pattern, I also found myself understanding the film more and what was once ambiguous and boring, became understandable and quite thrilling. The second half I found to be more philosophical and a thinking person's film, but in a clear and coherent way where you could actually understand most of it and the parts you didn't made for some excellent thought provoking discussions you could have after the film. The second half also had a lot more mazes in it and was more accessible featuring action scenes and a lot of thrills. It wasn't overblown with special effects like the first half was though. This time the chases and the mission to beat the clock, so to say, was actually intriguing and I really wanted to see where the film was going to go with all of this. At the end of the film, I would have to say I was satisfied. I picked up on a lot better writing, direction and acting in the second half that was actually really good. However, I just wish the whole film could have been this good instead of the endlessly jargon filled discussions and out of this world logic that the first half presented. I would still say that Inception is worth watching and based on how many good reviews there are of the film, I think most people had no problem with the first half at all. For those like me though, I would still say see it in a theatre, but be prepared to wait awhile for anything really good to happen and sit back and enjoy the second half because you most likely will. Because of a very strong second half I will give this film an 8 out of 10 rating, but believe me, if it had all been this good, the rating would be much higher.",8,1,5,3 August 2010
Lord of War," Lord Of War
","The Lord Of War, is about Yuri Orlov, who decides to become an arms dealer. Yuri, becomes very powerful and soon gets married to a woman named Ava Fontaine, and he lies to her about his profession. Soon, Yuri is going to different countries to sell guns and the places he is going to are very dangerous and an Interpol agent named Jack Valentine, is on his case and he also Yuri tries to continue to keep his job secret from his family and friends and soon has to make his own decisions as to whether to continue with his job or give it up to have a normal life and be with his family. The Lord Of War, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everyone involved (especially Nicolas Cage, who plays Yuri), good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The Lord Of War, is compelling, fascinating, powerful, good character development, a sharp script, engrossing, thought provoking, entertaining and stylish. Lord Of War, works as a dark comedy and becomes more of a drama as it goes along and works well when all put together. The film is very fascinating and entertaining and also makes a powerful statement and will leave you thinking after you see the film. I was very surprised by this film and it is a lot different than the ads will lead you to believe. One of the year's most powerful and best films.",8,1,7,17 September 2005
Arrival," Arrival
","Having now seen three of Denis Villeneuve's films on the big screen (Incendies, Sicario and now Arrival), I hope I do not repeat myself, or my other reviews when I say this, but he is definitely a director who is completely aware and knows how to perfectly arouse and set the viewer's senses to an almost stunned, or at least a very kind of awe inspiring emotion that is completely generated and fuelled by the powerful emotion and power that his films so masterfully play within us with our emotions and senses of vision and hearing. There are some scenes in Arrival, one scene in particular very early in the film where the three main characters are suited up in their protective suits and are investigating a mysterious pod and looking to see what the contents are inside of it and what, or who it represents. The scene sounds ordinary, or simple enough I do admit. However with Villeneuve's slow motion camera and the powerful musical accompaniment of Johann Johannsson's powerful score, the scene is anything but. As we get closer to investigating this pod and what, or who may be inside, I could feel a feeling of tension building up inside of me and I generally felt suspense and also a riveting feeling of fascination and curiosity as to what these characters may find. In a sense I also deeply felt a fear of the unknown as I was not sure what these characters would run into, or whether it would be good or bad. The film in this scene in particular had the same masterful power that Sicario did for example at building suspense and creating a feeling of uneasiness and yet at the same time completely transforming us into the events we are witnessing on the screen and allowing us to be every bit a part of them and everything feels so real and life like and it is as if we are not just watching the film, but that we are also a part of it. Like last year's Sicario, Arrival is by no means a suspense, thriller, or horror film in any way. Also most of the film does not have that impending sense of dread, or doom whereas I felt for one that Sicario did. However this scene in Arrival, was so brilliantly done and played on every single part of my senses and emotions that I would have to say that single handedly it was the most powerful and rewarding part of the film for me. Not to say that the film is bad in any way because it is not and while I vastly prefer Incendies and Sicario, to Arrival, I still found a lot of merit and things to compliment the film on and very few faults. The film if one had to classify it would be labelled as science fiction, but this is more a science fiction film where logic and one's emotions and senses play a large part and anyone looking for huge explosions, or massive special effects and action scenes should look elsewhere. Thankfully here Mr. Villeneuve knows how to create a decent science fiction film with a story that actually makes us think and uses smart and gifted people to play and tell the story and we are never at a loss, or bored, or left restless for any lack of action, special effects, or any of the same stuff we see year after year in your typical Summer movie blockbuster. This film is way smarter and better made than all that and it uses real people and situations that come out of real life to create a story that is in some ways quite unbelievable, but in it's own way and with it's precise and persuasive storytelling, we are hooked not only for reasons of sheer interest, but also we now have our emotions invested into the film, so however the film ends we are in it for the long haul. Amy Adams, does a very good job of playing a woman who has had past tragedies in her life that prevent her from finding joy and peace in a lot of ways, but she is also while hesitant about a lot of things, also a very independent person and one who relies on logic and emotions to make her decisions and do what she thinks is right. She is a damaged person in many ways and we see her daily struggles, but we also see that deep down she has the resources and the power to overcome that if she will let it. The supporting performances from Renner, Whitaker and Stuhlbarg are also all good as they are all typically good actors and do fine here as well. I did however find that the film at times lost some of what made it so interesting in it's second half which I didn't find quite as strong as the first and I also found there to be a lot of things that didn't quite add up, or several red herrings, or things that just didn't all come together for me. I wouldn't say that I didn't understand the film, or maybe I should say that some of it I got and other parts just left me puzzled and there was still a lot left unanswered, or that didn't make sense. This proved to be a bit of a problem at times. Still for a modern day science fiction film which is not typically what I would go see, Arrival is better than most and I thank Villeneuve for giving us a thinking person's film and not just more of the same old stuff that we have seen countless times before.",8,3,10,26 November 2016
The Big Short," The Big Short
","The Big Short, is based upon fact and deals with the people and businesses involved in the recession we had in 2008 as well as the major housing bubble that attributed to this recession and the failure not only of the big major banks, but Wall Street itself, and the many businesses and individuals who were affected because of this. Because this is still such a recent event, I am sure that it is still fresh in everyone's mind who is reading this review. It was all you would see on the television and print news back at the time and to say that it was not a big deal would be a great understatement. Based on the fact of enormous greed and people who had no scruples and to some extent having no clue what they were doing all these businesses were shut down and many people went bankrupt and not only lost their homes, but everything else they had as well. The whole situation was investigated in a fascinating and yet powerfully disturbing way in Michael Moore's documentary, Capitalism: A Love Story. At the time I saw the film, I claimed that it was probably the most disturbing film that I had seen that year, more so than any horror film, or thriller that had come out of Hollywood and I still stick with that statement. With the film adaptation of The Big Short, director and co-writer Adam McKay brilliantly blends fact and real events with comedy and entertainment and brings us one of the most entertaining films of this past year, but also one that will leave you furious and totally indignant with the whole banking system and everyone who was in charge of this massive mistake that was done out of sheer greed and stupidity. I think to a certain extent that you should have some knowledge of Wall Street, or banking rules and terminology to get all the facts as well as the jokes that are so important to the script and to the film itself. Then again, I know that financial literacy is not particularly a popular thing, nor is it something that you are taught in school unless you pursue post secondary education, but I think the film still manages to initiate the uninitiated in the whole world of banking and the endless language that they have seemed to have made their own with their own words and jargon to describe everything in words that most people would never understand (and maybe in a sense that is part of the point of doing so). The film will still make sense to those unfamiliar with all this and prove to be a still vastly entertaining and powerful film experience. Adam McKay who is mostly known for his comedies with Will Ferrell which range from being somewhat decent to sometimes unwatchable has created a brilliant piece of work here. The dialogue is sharp, fast and snappy and the characters are all extremely interesting and captivating to watch. They all have their own set of quirks and eccentricities and yet that is part of what is so fascinating to watch about them. There are also some wonderfully done celebrity cameos here and the use of quick editing and jump cuts is done so well here that is is one of the best uses of editing that I have seen in a film this year. The screenplay with it's razor sharp dialogue and it's blend of comedy and fact does a fantastic job of doing the unthinkable which is making a film on an event like this and making it interesting to viewers who would normally never care about this type of thing and end up being one of the best and most entertaining times at the movie of this past year. The film is funny in many ways, but at the same time it never forgets that the subject matter that it is dealing with is because of what happened to innocent people that it is both tragic and heinous what happened and how these bankers got away with all of this. You will walk away from this film entertained, but at the same time you are furious about it all as well and I mean that strictly as a compliment. The acting ensemble here along with Spotlight and Straight Outta Compton, is some of the best of the year and any nominations for the acting, writing, directing and editing are totally and completely justified. This may not be the easiest watch for those unfamiliar with all this, but I ensure that if you give it a chance you will definitely be surprised at what a great film this was. Alas, if only The Wolf of Wall Street could have been this good. Nevertheless one of 2015's best films.",9,1,1,9 January 2016
Prometheus," Prometheus
","Prometheus is a prequel to the 1979 film Alien also directed by Prometheus director Ridley Scott, and according to Scott, both films take place and are set in the same universe. The 1979 film Alien, has always been one of my favorites. It works as both a great science fiction film as well as a horror film as well. When it came out in 1979, Alien was nominated for two Academy Awards, and won one for Best Visual Effects. The film was well received by critics and audiences and proved to be also a major hit at the box office. It has also been credited as being one of the scariest films ever made. What worked so well for the original Alien, was it was a great looking film with it's sets and production design and keeping special effects very minimal, which could have also been because of the time it was made, but how they managed to pull it off was brilliant. The film was very affective at both keeping your interest as well as putting you in a feeling of dread and terror. Everything about the film worked and was successful at being a class act horror film. The music, the claustrophobic feeling you get from watching it and of course, not knowing what exactly is going to happen, or if it will, or when. The film launched the career of actress Sigourney Weaver, and showed that a woman could be a leading heroine and also be extremely tough, yet vulnerable and carry a movie all on her own, without needing the likes of Stallone, or Arnie to help her. The film looked great, had a great atmosphere and feel to it and plus it really was effective at creeping you out and keeping you entertained as well. The film because of it's success was followed by numerous sequels, some being quite good and others not. Now we come to Prometheus, done by original Alien director, Ridley Scott and also giving us a somewhat new story, but trying to make it connect somehow to events that we would later see in Alien, and the above mentioned sequels. When, I first saw the theatrical trailer for Prometheus, I thought that it would either turn out to be a great film, or a huge flop. It had the potential to be both. Luckily, I gave it a chance and went to see it and it is certainly no flop. With, Prometheus, Scott is again able to capture the style, mood and atmosphere of the original Alien. It's a fantastic looking film with it's sets and production design giving it a very futuristic yet believable and fascinating look to it. Much to my delight the special effects were kept at a minimum and what we got instead was top notch makeup and costume design people as well as some of the best technical artists in the business making everything look and feel great and it's affect is quite impressive. I did not see the 3D version of the film, but there is so much still that you can take in and take away from the 2D version of the film. The new worlds and places these characters take you to are so breathtakingly beautiful, yet haunting and mysterious at the same time that it almost has an overwhelming affect on you while watching it. The film's cinematography also made everything looked great and heavily contributed to this feeling. The story for the film did borrow some elements from the original Alien film, that I think a lot of fans of the series will also quickly pick up on, but there is also a lot of new stuff to absorb and take it as well as enjoy as well. The film's script is actually quite philosophical and intelligent and to say I totally understood everything with just one viewing, I would be lying. This is a film that requires you to pay attention and just devote your mind and your senses to the film for it's two hour running time and just let yourself go with it. I think on repeat viewings the film would still hold up terrifically well and I think it is one of those films that you will understand more as well as also appreciate more on a repeat, or several repeated viewings. The feeling of dread and terror is also in this film. I don't think it's affect was quite the same as the original Alien, but nevertheless still quite affective and using major skills and talent in delivering the scares including great music, timing, atmosphere and just building up the tension and surprises while keeping the gore at a minimum and not going overboard with fake looking gore, or special effects. The performances from Noomi Rapace as well as Michael Fassbender are terrific here and they really carry the film along with it's good supporting cast and it's very talented crew behind the camera. Really for me there was nothing not to like about this film. The advertising and marketing of the film was done in a great way to not give anything away, but to make us want to see it anyway. The film is epic and grand in the scale of 2001: A Space Odyssey, or even last year's Tree of Life. It is extremely affective and is certainly a thinking person's science fiction film, but also for the horror film fan as well. This is certainly a worthy prequel to the original Alien, and one day I think it will be held in the same regard and grow with it's stature and reputation over time. One of 2012's best films.",10,6,16,11 June 2012
Straight Outta Compton," Straight Outta Compton
","Just like I commented on last year's film Selma, I feel that the new film Straight Outta Compton about the rise of the rap group N.W.A. and it's group members including Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, could not have come out at a more crucial time. The film does indeed work very well as a musical biopic of the group's rise to fame, but as well as being a powerful film about the lives of the members of this rap group, the film also touches on key issues that were happening in the late 80's and early 90's and that are still affecting America today. The film depicts police brutality and the racism of the police at that time toward the African American community. People being stopped on street corners and harassed by the police for doing absolutely no crime, or misdemeanor other than the fact that they were standing at the wrong place at the wrong time. The film also incorporates the famous beating of Rodney King by police officers into it's story as well and the film works just as powerfully as Selma, as a statement against racism and against the powers that be that are suppressing and promoting racism, but I would argue that out of the two films, Straight Outta Compton is the better film and while some may argue that this film glorifies violence and gang behaviour, I would instead argue that it definitely depicts the everyday lives of these people and shows how they have made themselves in a society full of violence, narcotics and racism and how they struggled against these things and still managed to come out on top as one of the world's most influential groups and that was very impressive to me. The film still does depict the violent and sometimes offensive lyrics of N.W.A. and shows people trying to live the gangster type of lifestyle, but I think at the same time that some of these people were definitely a product of their surroundings and the home environment and world where they came from and how the system and society around them was often times failing them, yet at the same time these men grew for the most part out of the stereotypes and made names for themselves. Another interesting aspect of the film that it touches upon is the whole issue of censorship and freedom of speech. As anyone familiar with the group's lyrics and public performances can tell you, the group and it's members were often getting themselves into trouble over their lyrics and content which later resulted in arrests and threats from the Federal Bureau of Investigation against the group. One song in particular that addresses the corrupt and racist nature of the police of that area around the time was a particular instigator. Yet again, these young men were saying through their own type of poetry and street wise language and commenting yet again on the here and the now and because there was so much racism in that area and the police were at times racial profiling and just brutal towards the African Americans, it is not surprising the that particular song was so powerful and almost in a sense became an anthem for young people at that time. The film when it works as a musical biopic is also very powerful and well done. All the usual elements are here including arguments amongst the group and the shady business people they encounter and the typical lavish and yet unscrupulous way of living that resulted from the tons of cash their music was bringing in. I was surprised at how well this film turned out and how much I loved it. Everything about the film was done right. The acting which was mostly from an unknown cast (except for Paul Giamatti was the group's manager) all deliver exceptional performances here and of the films I have seen so far this year, I would have to say that this film has the strongest acting and ensemble cast of any film that I have seen so far this year. So kudos to these up and coming actors as they really got their stuff together and knocked it out of the park performance wise. F. Gary Gray's direction was also very impressive to me. I wasn't sure how the film would look and turn out with him as a director, but I would say this is his finest accomplishment and best direction to date. The film is at times gritty and very suitable for it's urban setting and at other times can be flashy and lavish as these young men are taken out of the ghettos and moving into more established areas and also doting more money to their homes and way of life. Yet those earlier parts of their life still affect and are part of their lives which is another powerful point of the story and the film does a good job of balancing both worlds. The film while it is longer it length certainly breezes right past you and is certainly the most entertaining two and a half hour film I have seen in awhile and it is so involving and captivating that it feels like there is not a single wasted moment, or frame in this whole picture and the pace and rhythm of the film is just perfect. Straight Outta Compton works as the most entertaining film of the year so far definitely, but it also works on a social scale as well and delivers a message that was important at that time and is still incredibly relevant today and just as powerful also. One of this year's best films.",10,10,47,22 August 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises
","The Dark Knight Rises is supposed to be and hopefully is the last of writer/director Christopher Nolan's Batman series. The first film in the series, Batman Begins, I know I gave a perfect rating, but after seeing it a second time, all the imperfections and things I thought were good the first time I saw the film, all turned out to be bad and I had no idea why I even liked it in the first place. The second film in the series, The Dark Knight, was a different reaction from me completely. I thought that it was a great film. I liked how instead of a lot of action and special effects we were given a great character study with a much worthy Oscar winning performance by Heath Ledger as The Joker. The film was extremely dark and bleak and by being so, it avoided all things that could be predictable, or clich√É¬©. It was an excellent character study and was very entertaining as well. Now we come to the much awaited third and supposedly last film in this franchise, The Dark Knight Rises. I did have higher hopes about this new one since Nolan achieved perfection with The Dark Knight, but as it turns out I wish I had saved my ten dollar admission fee and done something else instead. Pretty much everything I can think of about The Dark Knight Rises was bad. The acting here is all very limp and flat and doesn't make us care, or connect to any of these characters whatsoever, so it is very hard to feel, or care what happens to them. The film is the longest in the series and you can certainly feel that. It really drags along and several times during the film I wish I would have checked my watch in the darkness of the theatre to see when this thing was over. It just dragged for a very long time. Probably my biggest problem with the film lies in the story however. The script for this film was all over the place. It had non sequitor after another and just these events that did not make one ounce of sense and it all felt extremely out of place. The last half of the film felt almost surrealistic in a way and it was all handled very badly. It all seemed so ridiculous and stupid that I literally could not believe what I was watching before my eyes. The first thoughts that came to my mind was that Nolan and company did not know how to end this series and were blowing any credibility they had along with it. It all just feels so out of place, unbelievable and silly. It's not that it was particularly hard to follow, I felt I got it, but there was not a whole lot to get. It was just a terribly mangled set of ideas that were not put in the final product well at all. Nolan seems to be really big on the scene right now after these Batman movies and Inception (which I wasn't particularly fond of either) and I just hope he can figure out how to construct story lines and characters better and maybe try his hand at a different genre after these because from The Dark Knight and even an earlier film like Insomnia, he does show talent, it's just that this last attempt did not work. I will continue to give his work a chance though and hope he improves as a writer and director. To say this Batman franchise was a failure, would not be accurate. The Dark Knight, I think set a personal best among superhero films and he is to get the credit for that. With that film he achieved perfection in a summer time blockbuster that also appealed to the art house crowds and to people who would normally never see a Batman film. He did that by using a great story and actors and by making it bleak and dark and really grabbing us and forcing to deal with our emotions and that of the characters and he succeeded phenomenally. I would still have to call The Dark Knight Rises the worst film I have seen this year so far and I will probably never watch it again and for my personal advice to Christopher Nolan, is to not put too much in to one story as to overcrowd it and just focus more on characters and believability and less on special effects and making 'epic' films. I know he will succeed in the end, just not with this film.",4,5,12,23 August 2012
Iron Man," Iron Man
","Iron Man is a live action version of the comic book series featuring characters created by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. The film focuses on a rich weapons manufacturer named Tony Stark, who while on a business trip to Afghanistan, is kidnapped and forced to work on illegal weapons. With the help of a doctor who was also held captive, Tony eventually creatures a robotic body filled with different defence techniques and weapons, which he uses to escape and get back to America. Now back in America, and surviving a near fatal experience Tony, puts away his wild lifestyle and focuses on getting rid of weapons and making the world a safer place. Eventually, Tony has to put on the robotic suit once again to fight an evil co-worker and protect the city and world from weapons and evil. Lots of action and a build up to a probable sequel follow. Normally superhero action films aren't usually the kind of film that I pay much attention to, but within the last little while there have been some above average superhero films made and Iron Man, joins the team of successful ones. The film works on a large part because of Robert Downey Jr's top notch performance where at once he plays an arrogant and spoiled playboy to becoming a good hearted protector of things gone bad, so either way his snappy performance pulls it off quite well like it does in most of the films he stars in. The script the filmmakers have to work with is fairly intelligent and combines a look at the different characters in the film and much to my liking focuses more on them and has quite a good build up before it gets into action and special effects. More time is spent with the characters and how Tony, becomes Iron Man, and I much preferred this to a non stop special effects extravaganza. Even when there is action scenes they do the job of entertaining and don't go overboard by being too long, or too overblown by special effects, so that worked for me as well. While, I didn't think the supporting performances were quite as good as Downey's performance, they still held their own and for a film like this Oscar calibre performances aren't totally necessary even though what Downey pulls off is gold. I liked the pace of the film and thought it moved along quite well and for a film of this type I think the writers and filmmakers did a pretty good job of making something that could be loud, tedious and non stop with special effects into a more compelling and human story that combines the typical superhero movie elements, but does it well due to good timing, writing and direction. A good entry into this summer's movie schedule and an overall pleasant surprise.",8,1,2,17 May 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Vicky Cristina Barcelona
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is about two American friends who are both in their twenties, who decide to go to Spain for a few months during the summer. The first of two girls is Vicky who is engaged to be married to her fianc√© back home in America. Vicky is studying to complete her masters degree and overall is more of a conservative person. Cristina on the other hand has been in some amateurish type films and she really longs for romance whether it may be a one night stand, or a real lasting one. Cristina is a lot more adventurous which can not always be a good thing and even though at times Vicky and Cristina are the total opposites of each other they still work together well as good friends. While on their trip in Spain they meet an older Spanish artist who invites the both of them to come stay with him at his house and enjoy the many sights around them. Ultimately the film is about relationships. Some that work, others that do not and for people who get left out and are not particularly too sure of what they want. All this is told through narration and of course great dialogue and acting from the cast. Some of the television advertisements for Vicky Cristina Barcelona make the film look like some sexy, or erotic comedy, but I can most assuredly tell you that this film is neither one of those two things. Instead we are treated to a really interesting character study about relationships and the trials and sometimes the not so always pleasant things that happen in them. I found a lot of the film to be an accurate and honest look of this subject by providing us with everyday characters who would probably handle the relationships in this movie like most people of their age, or even older would as well. The writing and dialogue from writer/director Woody Allen is at it's best and he really deserves a Best Original Screenplay nomination for the film not only because of the well spoken, thought provoking and sometimes funny dialogue, bur for also writing and crafting such a story with some unique and overall really human and realistic characters that are examined in this tale of relationships which is a subject that Woody Allen does often and well too. The acting for the most part was really good with a standout performance by Rebecca Hall as Vicky. The other performances are quite good too, but I found Rebecca's performance as Vicky had the most emotion and depth to it and she delivered it perfectly. Spanish actors Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz yelling back and forth in Spanish at each other is also very interesting to watch and I enjoyed Bardem's playboy character. I'd probably have to say that the weakest performance in the film comes from Scarlett Johansson who plays Cristina, simply because her character doesn't have the same insight or is as dynamic, or as interesting as the other characters. Not to say that she weighs the film down, or anything like that, no not at all, but compared to the others it just really is not a standout performance, but because of the way her character is written, she is not given as much to work with and she is not as interesting a character as say Rebecca Hall's Vicky, or anything like that. Still that would be my only mild complaint about the film, but because of how the film plays out, one weak performance can not stop a movie with otherwise great acting and writing from being a great film. Listening to these characters talk was a very enjoyable experience if you are a fan of good writing and with the interesting dissection of these characters and these honest looks at their love lives I would say it is all done very well. This is also a beautiful looking film and is a lot to take in and think about. Even though I would not call this film a comedy I would say it works perfect as a drama and because of all the mastered writing and acting that went into it, I would say it's one of this year's finest accomplishments and one of the best films of the year so far.",10,7,17,21 August 2008

Sweet And Lowdown, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everybody involved, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, set decoration and good costume design. Sweet And Lowdown, is written and directed by Woody Allen, who is one of my favourite writers and directors but I was disappointed with this film. It wasn't a bad film and it was well acted and well made but there wasn't an awful lot to it. Not too much goes on in this movie and it doesn't really give the characters a chance to be as interesting as they could be. Also coming from Woody Allen, I didn't find the film funny at all. It also lacked his usual great dialog. Still the film is entertaining and I recommend it but it is not one of Woody Allen's best films.",7,0,0,6 June 2005

The Deer Hunter, is a very well made film and is a compelling film and a good character study. The film is about the Vietnam war but at the same time it is as much about war as it is about the effect the war has on these man and that they may never be the same. The film is powerful and entertaining as well as a thought provoking movie. The film is a very good film and one of the best movies about the Vietnam war or about the lives of the survivors of the war. I'am also surprised that the film's director Michael Cimino, hasn't done that much or is that well known after his great direction of this film.",8,0,2,6 August 2005
Beowulf," Beowulf
","Beowulf is an animated film based on an old English poem thought to be written between the 8th and 11th century and nobody has ever known who the author was and people still do not know, but the poem has become very popular throughout the years and has been the basis for other films as well. The film is animated using a technique called motion capture where the film's directors would film action and things in motion by the film's actors and later animate it over with 3 dimensional animation. The same technique was used a couple of years ago in the film The Polar Express also by Beowulf director Robert Zemeckis. The film takes place in late 500 AD in England and is about a village that is terrorized by a monster named Grendel who frequently comes to the surface of the Earth and kills whoever is being merry and making music. King Hrothgar sends for a warrior named Beowulf to slay Grendel and after doing so, Beowulf soon becomes king of the land, but a lie that he has covered up with his famous battle will soon come back to haunt him and the kingdom. I think because of the animation and visual style of the film and also because it's story and action sequences that people will compare this film to this year's earlier film 300. While I gave 300 a pretty favourable review on this site mostly because of the visuals I felt that the visuals were better than the story and film itself, but luckily Beowulf uses great animation and visuals along with a truly exciting and entertaining story. Beowulf is a beautiful film to look at because of it's animation and I thought the story was full of action and excitement which was enough to capture my interest for the film's length. I have always been into mythology and stories of that kind, so for that reason Beowulf also intrigued me even more and I think that today there is a large audience into the sword battle and monster films, so I think this film should appeal to many and with it's great pace it will surely entertain. The only thing I had a problem with in this film was a few lines of dialogue that the screenwriters put in that were unintentionally funny in a crude kind of way when I don't think they were particularly meant to be, so for that reason I don't think those few scenes really fit in and I noticed the audience laughed like I did at said moments, so I knew I wasn't the only one with this complaint. Those lines and scenes just didn't suit a serious film like this. However this is only a real mild complaint while the rest of the movie I enjoyed immensely because of the fascinating story, the non stop action and the visual beauty of the animation. This is one of the best animated films of the year so far and I think if people were to ignore those few scenes and lines of dialogue I mentioned above then they should be in for a good time as well as a visually stunning experience as well.",9,4,10,18 November 2007
Moonrise Kingdom," Moonrise Kingdom
","Moonrise Kingdom is the type of film that is beautiful and quite something to behold on several different levels. First off, the film looks amazing. It takes place in 1965 and with the wonderful cinematography of the film as well as the colour contrast they use for the buildings, sky, wilderness and so on, it all looks so beautiful and some scenes leap out at you almost because of their bright beautiful primary colours and others suggest a scene that may be more serious, or downplayed, but whatever the mood, or setting of said scene the film looks fantastic and certainly deserves a cinematography nomination among other things at next year's Academy Awards. The music of the film which mostly uses a lot of famous classical pieces such as Benjamin Britten, for example are all very beautiful and set the tone and feel of the film wonderfully as well. The film is actually quite concerned with music and it does have somewhat to do with the plot and the classical pieces among others that have been chosen for the film all sound beautiful and really create atmosphere and the moods and tones of each scene they are set in. So, Moonrise Kingdom is certainly a joy for the eyes with it's beautiful looking cinematography as well as production and art design and it also sounds great, but to say that is where the film stops on it's numerous levels of mass achievements would be totally unfair to the film and not giving credit where it is really due. The film about two young lovers who run away and the wonderfully eccentric townspeople who go looking for them has a lot more to it than what it may seem. Through the eyes of this young boy and girl (Sam and Suzy to be exact) we are somehow transported back to our own childhood and adolescent years and with great storytelling and character study we are able to connect and relate to these two young characters. Growing up everyone has their own story of their teenage years, their first love, their relationships with others, but the film does deal with some issues that should be universal and has hit all of us at one time, or another. Issues such as not belonging, or feeling like a misfit. You may be surrounded by all sorts of different peers and family members, but how many of them really get you as a person and can start a conversation, or even a friendship with you, or is it too difficult for them and also perhaps for you because of insecurities and differences of hobbies, interests and above all perception. When we are young we judge people by the clothes they wear, what they are into and all sort of superficial things that we later regret later on in life. However because of this we have often excluded and been the cause of hurt feelings and isolation to others. That is explored here. The dysfunctional relationships we can have with our parents where we may not always understand them and on the same topic they may not always understand you is developed here. However through it all, these two characters do connect and fall in love and start what is actually a very beautiful and endearing friendship. While the film could have been depressing, or another movie about today's so called 'lost youth', the film takes a different direction by instead embracing and celebrating what not only makes these characters different among their peers, but with the adult characters as well. We start to understand them better and care for them and maybe we were too harsh to judge them at first alongside the actors who share screen time with them. The film is ultimately a wonderful feel good film and it's brimming with such wonderful originality and creativity, I think it would be hard for some not to like it. Yes, the film has a style and tone all of it's own, but is so uniquely different and wonderful, instead of criticizing it, let's celebrate and reward it for the originality on display here. The actors from young and old all do a terrific job here and overall Moonrise Kingdom, is terribly and wonderfully original and creative and has the power to remind us of our childhood and maybe can even help heal some of those wounds with it's beautiful and entertaining story. One of the best films of 2012.",10,3,6,21 September 2012
Flight," Flight
","When, I first started seeing trailers for Flight, back in the summer, it looked like a much different movie then it actually turned out to be. I think Denzel Washington is a good actor, but over the years I have not gone to see him in much, simply because a lot of the films looked like loud action films where he displays none of his acting talent and is basically doing those type of films for a paycheck. I much preferred him in dramas such as Malcolm X, The Hurricane, or even American Gangster, from a few years ago. I am happy to say that while nowhere near a perfect movie, Flight is better than I thought it would be and Denzel, is able to show off his acting abilities in a film where there is no real action, or adventure, but rather a fairly well developed character study that deals with the issue of substance abuse and in this case, alcoholism. I found a lot of Flight, did work well. The acting from the whole ensemble cast was quite good and the performances seemed real and believable. The screenplay often as well seemed realistic and charted what I would imagine the ups and downs of an alcoholic would be without sentimentalizing it too much. At one point during the film, I was afraid it was going to go in a certain direction that to me would ruin the whole film and more, or less be an ending that would perhaps appeal to many, but to me would ruin pretty much everything the film had going for it, or was trying to say, but much to my surprise the film did not take that way out and I appreciated it for that. When, I think of powerful and realistically done films dealing with alcohol abuse, two films that come to mind are John Cassavetes' Opening Night and John Huston's Fat City. Both films included powerful performances and were not shy in showing the pain, struggle and heartache that alcohol, or basically any type of addiction could have on a person and also their work life, their performance and how it affects their health and the ones around them as well, whether it be co-workers, family, or friends. Those films were hard hitting and made not as pieces of entertainment, but rather as character studies were we walk away from seeing them having learned something and gone for quite a powerful ride feeling the tumultuous and often draining experience of what it would be like to be these characters, or even to watch them. I would have to say that Flight, does not have the same impact, or delivers in quite the same way. Yes, Denzel Washington is very good here and most likely he will be nominated for an Oscar for his performance, but at times I didn't always feel that Denzel was the right choice to play this character. Denzel, is a very popular actor and with a few exceptions like Training Day, we are mostly accustomed to him playing the roles of clean cut heroes who more, or less save the day in whatever type of situation the film he is in calls for. He is a little too famous, handsome and well known for this type of role and that is one of the reasons why it does not work. I remember back in my school days hearing the testimony of a man who lose almost all of his family due to drug addiction and he wanted to stress that people who are addicted to drugs did not look glamorous, or cool as they have been made to look in the movies. His example was John Travolta and Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction, and how while they did a lot of drugs in the film, they always had glamour and a certain style to them and I would have to agree with that remark. There are certain scenes in Flight, that are a little more gritty and feel a lot more realistic, but there are also scenes where sometimes things happen and it feels like they have been done that way to overemphasize things and make everything a lot more dramatic, whereas to me it felt forced and did not always work. Instead of an over 30 million budget, make a smaller film with lesser known actors and try to make it gritty and intense and not like a glamorous 30 million dollar Hollywood film. One other aspect of the film that I did not appreciate was how it seemed to portray Christians, or basically anyone religious in the film as fanatics and while the audience laughed at them, the film seemed to be as well. Truth is that if Denzel's character had paid even the slightest bit of attention to them, or what they were trying to say to him, he most likely would not have been in the situation he was in. Flight, works as an intriguing and entertaining story, but it is not as powerful, realistic, or as well acted, or researched as it could have been. Worth seeing as entertainment, but only offers minimal food for thought.",8,2,3,25 November 2012
Munich," Munich
","Munich is based on the book Vengeance by George Jonas. The film and book are inspired by the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany where a Palestinian group came and killed and held hostage some of the Israeli Olympic team. After this occurred a group of men including an intelligence officer are sent all over Europe to kill different men who were behind the killings that went down during the 1972 Olympics. After committing these murders the intelligence officer named Avner , has to battle some demons of his own. Munich has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, great performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. When I first went into this film it took me a little while to get into it and understand what was going on, but from there I started to love the film more and more as it went along. It is very well made and has great acting and also is really an involving film. This film captured my interest and it would not let go. I was compelled through the whole movie seeing what these men did and I found the last bit of the movie where Avner has to deal with his own demons and thoughts of what he did to be very well acted and a good character study. The film also has some thought provoking moments and lets the viewers make up their own opinion of what happened after the Olympic tragedy. Munich is a powerful film that has quite a punch and it entertained me and kept my interest the entire time. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg and I would say that this ranks up there as one of his best films ever. This film deserves many Oscar nominations for the things I mentioned above and I hope that people see this movie and that it is awarded come awards time. This is one of the best films I have seen of 2005 and probably one of the best films I have seen it quite awhile. A truly powerful and moving experience and one of the best movie going experiences I have had in awhile. Munich is a true masterpiece.",10,0,1,8 January 2006
Godzilla," Godzilla
","For me, usually the summer time is a fairly weak time of movies, so during the summer I review few movies and just do not get out to the theatre all that much because of lack of selection. As my usual readers know, I am not one for the usual summer fare that comes out each year. Superhero films, sequels, prequels, big budget action films with a lot of special effects. None of that is in my range of taste whatsoever. I prefer the fall and winter seasons, because then you have all the award worthy films trying to win Oscars coming out and sure not all of them are always great, but it is a much better selection and they are better films quality wise than what we are subjected to during the summer time. That being said, I was not sure whether or not I would like this new version of Godzilla. It was released during the summer time, had the special effects, 3D glasses and big budget and all the things I usually avoid from a summer movie release. The last time I saw the character Godzilla, on the big screen was Roland Emmerich's 1998 version, which I saw when it came out and I thought it was absolutely terrible and for obvious reasons associated with that, I have never seen it since. A few years ago, The Criterion Collection issued a DVD and Blu Ray release of both the original 1954 Japanese version of Godzilla, directed by Ishiro Honda and in the same package also included the 1956 American version directed by Ishiro Honda and Terry O. Morse and starring Raymond Burr. I ended up getting that DVD release and I enjoyed both the Japanese and American versions of the film (while I still did like the Japanese version better). With this new version of Godzilla, I have to say that overall I quite liked it. It was better than I thought it would be, not a masterpiece, but for a film of this kind, quite good and it exceeded my expectations for it. I have read online that a lot of viewers were disappointed with this new version, but for the reasons they did not like it, it seemed like those were a lot of the reasons I did like it. The film while it does have scenes of monsters, destruction and mayhem, did not focus exclusively on this and actually built the story up a fair bit before we are actually even introduced to Godzilla. I liked how it showed how these events occurred and sort of setting the tone and mood for what would come later in the film as well as giving a back story both to the human characters in the film as well as the monsters as well. So for that reason alone, I think a lot of people who just wanted non stop action for their two hours were disappointed because the film actually had a lot more to offer than that, by way of a fairly well developed screenplay and characters. I am not usually a fan of 3D, or the glasses, but I did not find that this version used it in an overwhelming, or self indulgent way as to take away from the story. The 3D really did not play all that big a role in this film and focused more on story and characters instead of the monsters themselves, or the explosions and crumbling buildings and I thought that was the right way to go. The film had a good pace and captured my interest from the beginning and continued to hold it to the end. Also while some of the Godzilla sequels over the years (we might even include the 1998 version in here as well) got very campy and silly, this version played it seriously and got rid of the hokey ness and bad effects and acting of some of the other versions in this 60 year long series. While the acting was not really good, or bad in this new version, I did feel that the performances suited the film and the tone they were trying to go for. We have a lot of good actors in this new version and I would not say they were wasted here, but rather they all came out to do a film like this and probably had fun and now they can all go back to the serious and dramatic roles that we are more accustomed to seeing them in. The effects for the film were impressive, but not too flashy, or in your face either and the action was handled just right, so it seemed believable enough without getting too ridiculous, or far fetched with it. I thoroughly enjoyed myself during this film and overall I was entertained which is the job of a film like this. Would I buy it? No. Would, I see it again someday? Maybe. As it stands it works exceedingly well as a summer popcorn film that actually has more to offer on the table than your usual summer blockbusters and has more of a thinking person's mentality to the film and giving it a certain edge of seriousness and taking away all camp and silliness. The film was more about story than explosions, or action and that is one of my main compliments for the film and while it may turn some viewers off I know it will win over more, including people in my camp and stance for these kind of films as well.",8,2,4,30 May 2014
300," 300
","300 is based on the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. The film takes place in 5th century B.C. and is about the battle of Thermopylae in which 300 Spartan soldiers lead by King Leonidas fought Xerxes and the Persian army. The film shows us several of the battles until one side finally won. The film uses real actors, but was filmed in front of a blank screen and then the background was made digitally and many of what you end up seeing is digital including some of the animals in the movie, the background as I already mentioned and right down to the gore from the battle scenes. Having really liked the film Sin City which was based on graphic novels by Frank Miller and was also a film he co-directed I was waiting in a lot of anticipation for 300. Overall, I was fairly impressed, but I did have a few problems with the film that would have otherwise probably lead me to give it a higher rating. I will start off with my few negatives about the film. First of all the dialogue in the film was not very good. There is not a lot of conversations in this film seeing as most of it is battles, but when the characters did talk their vocabulary consisted of lines that you would only find in a non very well written comic book. I realize comic books or graphic novels aren't known for having great dialogue and conversations, but having also read the Sin City graphic novels I felt that they often had very good conversations and in the stories that required narration I thought it worked quite well. Maybe I'm being a little hard on the film for this seeing as it does take place in the 5th century and a film about battles isn't supposed to sound like a Shakespeare play, so maybe I should cut it a little bit of slack, but still I thought the characters could have talked a little better and said things that would not later be considered something that would later turn into some sort of catchphrase for wrestling or something in the same vain. The only other complaint I had about the film was the pacing. At times the film moved really well and I was really getting into it which was great, but there were a few scenes that kind of dragged on for me and had they been edited or arranged a little differently I thought it could have had a bigger impact on me and would have drawn me closer into the film. Those being my only flaws of the film I will get to the positives of it. I will start by saying that the way they digitally made this film makes it look gorgeous and I really liked the style of the film that was really enhanced by this look. Except for a few scenes the movie moved fairly well and at one point I was surprised the movie was already done by the time it was over. Also for a movie that relied heavily on stylized battle scenes for the most of it's running time the film did manage to entertain for most of that time whereas in other films it could have become tiresome and tedious. For being a great looking and action packed and entertaining film I will recommend 300, but don't go in looking for anything remotely historically accurate or to be blown away by acting and dialogue because you won't find that here. On the other hand what you may find may just be what you are looking for in a movie anyways.",8,3,7,17 March 2007
The Thin Red Line," The Thin Red Line
","The Thin Red Line is based on the novel by James Jones. The film takes place during the second World War and focuses on the soldiers and their battles in Guadalcanal. The film focuses on one soldier in particular named Private Witt. This film has won over 17 awards worldwide. The Thin Red Line has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good art direction and set decoration. The film is a gorgeous looking movie with great cinematography and photography. It is a beautiful film to look at. The film is a little slow in some spots, but overall it captured my attention and kept me interested. There isn't a lot of plot to this movie, but I liked how the film managed to show us what these characters went through and some of the struggles and different things that happened to them during this war. The one soldier that the film focuses on named Private Witt is a likable and kind character and I liked how we got to see the war from his perspective and his thoughts and views on it. This is a war movie, but it is done in such a way that it is much more of a war movie. Yes, it does have battle scenes and violent moments but there is also scenes where the soldiers travel around where there is little or no dialog and we focus on the beautiful scenery and feel curious and compelled to know what happens next. Probably much like the soldiers felt at the time. This is a compelling film and also a film that has some good character study and beautiful moments of scenery and moments of silence that make us appreciate the characters and the film so much more. This is a great movie and one of the best war movies in a very long time.",10,2,5,21 May 2006
Green Book," Peter Farrelly's Green Book
","I love it when filmmakers who are usually classified, or tend to stick within one genre, or type of film only and then they eventually break that cycle and area of familiarity and do something radically different. In recent years I have cited examples such as Adam McKay who got away from his Will Ferrell films to do The Big Short, and not only was it the best reviewed film of his career, but it also won him a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar. Something that most likely would not have happened if he had just stuck to his usual fare of manic if not sometimes annoying comedies. Also please take Todd Phillips who is also known for often raunchy teen oriented comedies such as The Hangover trilogy and others that pretty much fall into the same category. He branched out and tried a mix between comedy and drama in War Dogs, and whilst the film got mixed reviews generally, I would personally say that it was the best accomplishment of his career and further reaching out for new goals, he was also the producer of this year's version of A Star is Born which has been a big hit with audiences, critics and at the box office. Some say that it still has a very good chance to nab several Oscars, possibly even Best Picture. Now in this case with Green Book, we have writer/director Peter Farrelly who is again known for mostly doing gross out, or raunchy and immature comedies such as the Dumb and Dumber films and various others. I have liked some of his and his brother Bobby's work in the past, especially something like There's Something About Mary, but more often than not, their particular brand of humour was often far different than my own personal taste. This time around, Peter takes a true story and helps write the screenplay and directs, but here he chooses a film that has just as much if not more laughs than the films he would normally do, but also at the same time he gives the film a timely message of friendship and acceptance and I think anyone who is not deeply moved by the film on some level probably saw a different film than I did. It is full of rich humour and some of the best work from dependable actors Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. The film is all the more timely because as we all know the problem with racism in our world is still running rampant and how refreshing it is to see two men from completely different backgrounds and are more or less worlds apart from one another and how they form a bond and connection that will lead to a lasting friendship and a road trip across the Southern United States that I doubt either man would ever forget. Viggo's character is a bouncer in several nightclubs in the Bronx area of New York. He has a large appetite, uses coarse language on a regular basis and is a little rough around the edges and tends to have a habit of either winning people over with his schemes and dubious personality, or at the same time completely offending, or turning people off as in the case of Mahershala Ali's character. Ali's character is a concert pianist with many degrees and doctorates and is very well spoken and educated. He couldn't be more different than Viggo's character if he tried. And there is also the cultural differences such as Viggo's Italian background and Ali's character being of African American descent. This looks like it would be the worst possible match in history and yet Viggo drives Ali's character across the United States for about two months to get him to his various different concert performances. The two will occasionally bicker with more often than not, Ali's character being completely exasperated and often offended and turned off by Viggo's character's more street type talk and peronality. However, as time goes by the two do form a common bond with one another and actually start to become friends. As well as on several occasions while in the deep Southern states that Viggo will come to Ali's rescue and one humourous instance where Ali uses a powerful ally to bail them out of a tough spot. This is a film about putting any and all prejudices aside and seeing goodness within your fellow man and learning to appreciate that. This road trip truly shapes these two characters in marvellous ways and we see that deep down under a rough exterior that Viggo's character has a huge heart and that Ali deep down is dealing with loneliness and his own trials and tribulations, but is further helped by Viggo's friendship and way, or should I say lack of way with words and handling people. This is an absolutely wonderful film that made me laugh more than any other film this year and at the same time it warmed my heart and moved me and helped me to appreciate the racist attitudes of the 60's when the film takes place and again show how we still need to further move ahead as a society. The performances by the two leads are I think the two best male performances I have seen this year and the characters are so wonderfully vibrant and full of emotions, personality and life all thanks to a meticulously researched and well scripted story for our actors and characters.
A film of this type of quality does not come along too often, so I suggest you see it while you can and do not be surprised to see various Oscar nominations and even potential wins. One of the best films of this year.",10,2,4,25 November 2018
Click," Click
","Click is about a man named Michael Newman who lives with his wife Donna and his kids Ben and Samantha. Michael is a workaholic and spends more time on work that he is on his family. One day while getting frustrated with all the remotes in the house he goes down to a department store and gets a mysterious universal remote control from an unique man named Morty. Michael finds that with this remote control he can turn down the volume of his dog's bark, fast forward through fights with his wife and many other unique things. But soon the remote is working on it's own and begins fast forwarding through Michael's life and all the big important things coming in the future. Michael now has to stop the remote before it fast forwards through his whole life and if he can ever get back to where he was he wants to seriously consider his life and how much time he is spending with his job rather than his family. Click has good direction, a good script, good performances by the cast and good film editing. After watching this film I was surprised at how different it was than the usual Adam Sandler films. Sure it has some crude humour and the typical kind of Adam Sandler jokes that you will find in almost all of his movies, but this film is also touching, sweet and has a lot of feeling and emotion. The film reminded me of a modern day version of the film It's A Wonderful Life only in an Adam Sandler kind of way. I really liked this film for it's original script and idea and there were some amusing moments in this movie and also a lot of tenderness and heartfelt moments. This film works as a comedy and it works as a drama as well. Proving he can also provide a great dramatic performance in films such as Punch Drunk Love, Adam Sandler does the same here and the result is a very entertaining, fun and touching film that should appeal not only to fans of Adam Sandler, but to a lot of the film going public as well. I really liked the original ideas and plot of this film and I liked the goofy parts and most of all I liked the last half of the film where Michael re-thinks his life and where us the audience are treated to a lot of well done drama scenes. Click works on a lot of levels and next to Punch Drunk Love is probably Adam Sandler's best film. I hope with the success of this film that Adam Sandler does more dramas seeing as he has proved on several occasions that he can and I hope he chooses more original films like this. Click gets a big recommendation from me and I was very pleasantly surprised how much I liked it.",9,1,5,11 July 2006
Pineapple Express," Pineapple Express
","Pineapple Express is a new comedy about a 20 something year old stoner named Dale, who along with his drug dealer named Saul, are both on the run after Dale saw something that he probably shouldn't have and the film's two antiheroes end up running from crooked cops and an evil drug kingpin while drug humour, male bonding and over the top action sequences follow. Basically if you are not a fan of stoner humour, or movies involving that type of humour, then it is a pretty safe bet that you are not going to enjoy this movie. For those who just enjoy a good comedy much like myself then there is a pretty good chance you will like it if you are a fan of Cheech and Chong and other films or sketches of the same variety. I've heard some people were also put off by some of the more graphic violence in this film, but I think a lot of the violence is done in such an over the top and almost cartoonish way that I think it is hard to take it too seriously, or be really offended by it. Seeing as this is a comedy a lot of the violence is more slapstick and even when there is bloodshed it is usually played for laughs. While, I didn't find this film as funny as the writers previous film Superbad, I still found a lot to enjoy and appreciate about the film and there were still several moments where I had a grin on my face and was amused by some of the clever one liners, or some of the on screen shenanigans that were going on. A lot of the humour like most of the R rated comedies now does rely on a lot of crude humour and language, so I guess if that is not your kind of entertainment then this film probably wouldn't be for you either. What, I found impressive about the film was it's fast paced and humorous script and I also liked the on screen chemistry from the film's two lead actors. Once again some have complained that this film was too long for a comedy, but I really did find the film to move really fast and I thought it had a good pace to it and because it was so entertaining with non stop humorous scenes and action (especially in the second half) that I find it hard to believe that people were getting tired of it. I was enjoying myself so much that it could have been over two hours and I probably would have still enjoyed it as much as I did. The film doesn't particularly break any new barriers and I have seen a lot of other films in the past year or two that I would say are funnier, but this film still works really well largely because of the great screen pairing of Seth Rogen and James Franco and the fresh one liners and over the top yet fun action in the second half. Pineapple Express worked for me and if you are a fan of films of this kind then I'm sure you'll enjoy it as well and I'm sure this will be a film that will end up in a lot of DVD collections and work as a late night cult film for some years to come and that is not a bad thing at all.",9,1,4,9 August 2008
Inside Llewyn Davis," Inside Llewyn Davis
","Leave it to the Coen brothers to give us one of the most original and unique films of last year. They have been doing this most of their career from Blood Simple, up to and including, Inside Llewyn Davis, with very few missteps along the way. This is a later film I saw of 2013, but as of now I would have to say that it is my personal favourite film of last year. Why? Well, I will do my best to explain that in the following few sentences. First off, I like the character Llewyn Davis a lot. That isn't to say that he was a great, or inspirational character, or anything like that. In fact the character himself is a pompous and full of himself person with not that much going for him and his over indulgence and pride and arrogance are the downfall of him. He is not all that likable a character, but that is what I liked so much about him. He is our antihero for this film and his personality and the many assorted predicaments that he gets himself into, during the course of this film are so intriguing and fascinating that this is one film that grabbed me from it's opening shot to it's closing one. I laughed with and at Llewyn, sometimes felt a little pity for him, but mostly just really enjoyed watching him as he tries to make a name for himself in the music industry and sort out the various annoying problems that go on in his life, some of which, as I mentioned, he causes himself because of his attitude and his big mouth. Fans of other Coen brothers films know that they like their music and really good cinematography and this film is not failing in that regard either. A lot of the film's original folk music (actually performed by actor, Oscar Isaac, and cast) is very good and really suits the setting of the early 1960's Greenwich Village folk scene. I still can't quite contemplate how 'Please Mr. Kennedy' did not end up getting a Best Original Song nomination at the Academy Awards. The cinematography (which it is nominated for) is superb. The film takes place during a long and dreary winter and the cinematography gives the film a bleak, cold and very depressing look which really enhances the mood and tone that the film is going for. It was achieved successfully. The acting was also fantastic from Oscar Isaac, playing Llewyn Davis, to the various supporting characters that he meets during his travels as well. As, I mentioned earlier, Isaac performed the songs written for him and he gets so into character playing this unlikable and self indulgent character, but also lets us laugh and occasionally have pity for him as well. It is a brilliant performance that should have been nominated a lot more than it has been. All the supporting characters and actors are great as well and the thing about these supporting characters is that each and every one of them is just as interesting as it's main character, so watching them is an absolute joy as well. The Coens always do their own screenplays and they have a certain style that has become familiar to fans of their work and this film brilliantly shows their madness and creativity. The character development runs deep and the film is so entertaining and often gives us a lot to laugh at as well. It is also fantastically different and offbeat and really unlike any other recent film in memory, which I give them a lot of credit for. They know how to set certain scenes, build up characters and surprise and shock us out of nowhere with things we just did not see coming. The film is about music and the folk scene of the early 1960's, so fans of music, or people who lived through that time should easily enjoy and find a lot to identify with in this film. For someone like myself and many others who were not around at that time, there is still so much to love here and the story is one that can appeal to any and every generation of film fans who appreciate unique and great works of art which we have on display here. This film is a great work of art from the talent and skills behind and in front of the camera. This is a film that entertained and grabbed me from when it started to when it ended and made me laugh and just made me appreciate the brilliance that is the Coen brothers for another great film in their already impressive lineup. Inside Llewyn Davis, is my favourite film from 2013 so far and if you are in the mood for something different, original and artsy, then it may be one of your faves too.",10,1,2,14 February 2014
Sin City," Sin City
","Sin City, is based upon the comics of the same name by Frank Miller, who also co-directed the film. The film is in black and white and looks like a film noir from the 40's. All the male characters are tough as nails and smoke and wear trench coats and all the female characters are scantily dressed prostitutes. There is only some things in the movie that show colour such as a character's blue eyes or a red dress on a character. The story has several different stories all involving a lot of action and a lot of energy. Sin City, has good direction. a good script, good performances from everyone involved, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good set decoration and good makeup and visual effects. Sin City, is an excellent looking movie with it's costumes, sets, makeup and black and white cinematography that looks like it has come right out of the 40's. It should definitely be nominated for some awards just for the way the film looks. The film took a little while for me to get into because it starts right off with a bang and has non stop action which at first I found hard to get into because it was hard to get character development and concentrate on one thing for too long. But by the third story starring Clive Owen, and Benicio Del Toro, I was into the movie and was enjoying this very exciting and energy pumped ride. The film is extremely unique and original, is well made, has great dialogue, has interesting characters, is an interesting film to look at, is a very entertaining film, is fun, exhilarating, has some funny moments and is a visually stunning and entertaining film. The film is very violent and is not for young kids but I have been told it is very faithful to the comic books it is based on and having not liked many movies based on comic books I can tell you that this one holds out, and it holds out well and is really a very good film. One of the most entertaining films of the year so far and also one of the most original.",Null,0,2,1 April 2005
True Romance," True Romance
","True Romance, is about a young man named Clarence Worley, who one night in a movie theater meets a girl named Alabama Whitman, and after that they go get some pie and then go back to his place. Later that evening Alabama admits to Clarence that she is a call girl and was hired by Clarence's boss to sleep with him. Alabama tells Clarence, that she is in love with him and he is in love with her so they get married. Clarence one day decides to go and get Alabama's stuff which is being held at her pimp's place. His name is Drexl Spivey. Once Clarence gets there he kills Drexl, and most of the people in the room and along with getting Alabama's belongings he also takes a suitcase full of cocaine worth a lot of money. Clarence and Alabama then visit Clarence's father Clifford Worley, and tell him that they are going to California for their honeymoon. A man who works for a well known gangster visits Clifford and tries to find out where Clarence and Alabama are because apparently the cocaine belongs to his boss. So while in California, they have a gangster on their trail and while trying to sell the cocaine to a movie producer and things are not as they seem during the deal. True Romance, has good direction, a good script, good performances by everyone involved, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The version of the film I saw was the unrated version. True Romance, has some great dialog and is a very fun and entertaining movie. The film is full of action and thrills and it is all done very stylishly. The film is well made and has a good script by Quentin Tarantino, which he sold before he made his first film Reservoir Dogs. The film does have some flaws and some characters I might wanted to have seen and learned more about and some scenes kind of felt like they went on a little too long but the film is generally a lot better than most action films out there and the acting, writing and style of the movie make it also an above average action film. In fact the film is really good and it was a good film for Quentin Tarantino to have been involved in to start his career. A very good action film that is full of energy and will definitely appeal to action fans and fans of Quentin Tarantino.",8,1,3,8 July 2005
Her," Her
","Spike Jonze's Her is one of the most perceptive, original and truthful films I have seen in quite awhile dealing with love, loss and loneliness. The film takes place in the not so distant future, but everything in it seems believable and even the more science fiction, or futuristic parts of the film all seem like things that could be next, or coming up for us. The story about a man falling in love with his operating system does sound quite unusual I do admit, but when you watch the film, several things become quite apparent during this time. First off, the film's lead character Theodore. We see him as he goes to work each day and how he doesn't seem like all that joyful a person. He goes to work, spends a few hours at home playing video games, but he really does not have too many connections to the outside world and other people other than those he runs into once in awhile at work. We see the loneliness and sadness in his eyes and demeanor, as he tries to reach out a couple of times and yet we sense a certain awkwardness and hesitation on Theodore's part and realize that he is socially awkward with both women and men and perhaps also because of bad relationships in the past he is shielding and more or less protecting himself from getting hurt again. Now enter Theodore's new operating system, which calls itself, Samantha and can talk with him, joke with him and the two of them bond and connect during their conversations with one another, despite the fact that Samantha, is just a computer and there is no real intimacy, or human connection to this relationship, other than what is on the surface. I think this is one of the things Theodore loves so much about it. Samantha, is always there for him to help with his electronic files and such, but also as someone to talk to whenever he wants to and someone he can talk about things he might normally have difficulty talking to others about. At the same time, Samantha is more than just a computer system in the way that she can actually carry on conversations, joke, make anecdotes and carrying on with Theodore in conversations like she is right there in the room with him and knows him personally and deeply. The film is about as I mentioned above, love loneliness and loss as Theodore becomes a much different person when he has Samantha with him and he also looks at the world in an entirely different way. However what I think the film is trying to say here is, is this normal? Should a relationship like this be able to function? And in a sense isn't Theodore in a way, going back to his old antisocial ways and not really bonding with any human beings, but instead a piece of electrical equipment? The film looks at this from all these angles and the great thing about this movie is that we can certainly empathize with Theodore, because who out of all of us has never felt lonely, or sad and just wanted to reach out to someone in those moments of desperation. At the same time we feel sad for Theodore, as this is the only stable thing in his life at the moment and we see how he badly needs a human relationship and someone real to talk to, whether it be a romantic relationship, or otherwise. The film is quite original in it's way of depicting all of this, but it never feels weird, or out of the norm. It all feels believable and an accepted form of society. I love how Spike Jonze gives so many different aspects and layers to his characters here, so they are not just one dimensional, but have so much more to them as well. Even the operating system, Samantha has so much to her even though all we can do is hear her. The film is classified as a comedy, but during the duration of the film, I think I felt more sadness overall than comedy, because certain aspects of this story are certainly heartbreaking. We do have some funny moments, but overall I would classify it as a drama. Spike Jonze delivers one of the most original, thought provoking and insightful films and screenplays about romance and human connection that I have seen in quite awhile and his Golden Globe win for Best Screenplay was well deserved. Joaquin Phoenix, who is an actor that continually impresses me more and more all the time delivers a fantastic performance as a sad and in some cases a desperate man that we learn to care and have our own feelings for. It was one of the best male performances of last year. Equally as good is Scarlett Johansson as the voice of Samantha. No, we never do see Samantha as anything physically other than a small computer, but Johansson conveys so much feeling and depth in just her voice alone for this performance, that I think it is one of her all time best performances. This film will give you a lot to think about and reflect upon and that is another reason why I loved it so much. For a film that challenged my way of thinking and for being so honest about it's subject and subject matter and moving me inside and because of the great writing and acting that accompanies it, Her is one of the best films of 2013 and one that I hope more people will discover currently in it's wider release at theatres.",10,1,4,14 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Slumdog Millionaire
","Slumdog Millionaire is based upon the novel Q & A by Vikas Swarup. The film takes place in India and is centered around a young man named Jamal Malik who has just made it onto the Indian version of the popular television game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. As the show goes along we are told in flashback scenes of Jamal growing up in the slums of India and eventually falling in love with a girl named Latika. Jamal's past experiences whether they were good, or bad, have helped shape his life and provide the answers to many of the questions in the television game show that he is now on. Jamal has had a lot of difficult times in his life, but through personal growth and determination he wants to take the top prize and get in touch with Latika who he has not seen for years. Early last fall I remember reading on several different movie websites that Slumdog was definitely going to be nominated for several Oscars and become a huge crowd pleasing hit. Back at that time I knew very little about the film, but those early predictions were right as the film is now nominated for ten Oscars, has won tons of other awards and is on many critics' top ten lists as one of the best films of last year. I wanted to see the film quite badly, so I repeatedly e-mailed my local theatre to see if they would get the film. They replied back with an article from The New York Times entitled Films Reach Theaters a Drib Here, Drab There by Michael Cieply. The theatre closest to my home did not get Slumdog, but another one not so far away did and that is where I saw it. Overall, I quite liked it. I would not go as far as saying it is one of my favourite films of the year, or the best of the nominated films, but I did like it. The script having been based on a novel is very original and I liked how we saw Jamal grow up in a very harsh and disturbing way, but to grow out of it and become what could be a huge star. The film shows the greed, corruption and danger he has to go through along the way and I found it all quite interesting and it almost played out like a modern day fable with a good lead character, many villains and untrustworthy people along the way as well as a big prize at stake. Not too mention the love story aspect of the script as well. All of this worked for me and did a fairly good job of keeping my interest and involving me with the characters and the story. Visually this film was quite spectacular as well. It had a gritty tone in some scenes and is bright and illuminated in others. The cinematography, visuals and fast paced editing gave the film a certain style and I for one really liked it and found it appropriate to the story and overall movie. A lot of the actors in the film did quite a good job and I think the location shooting in India shooting the scenes showing Jamal's upbringing was quite well done and needs to be acknowledged as well. Sometimes, I felt Slumdog had a little more style than it did an involving story, but there were still times where I was quite fascinated by what was going on in front of me and there was so much to admire here that I found it hard not to give this film a favourable review. While not my favourite film of the year I still found lots to like about Slumdog Millionaire and for the more curious of filmgoers it is definitely worth seeing once, or perhaps twice to truly appreciate it.",9,1,3,25 January 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Max: Fury Road
","I think what would be most appropriate when reviewing a film like, Mad Max: Fury Road, is to do a move that the late great, Roger Ebert did a couple of times. When he reviewed his own film, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (which he wrote along with writer/director Russ Meyer) and when he reviewed John Waters' Pink Flamingos, he gave neither film a star rating. With, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, the reason was quite obvious, because he wrote the film and was good friends with Meyer, and regardless of the film being a cult masterpiece (which I think it is), he did not give it a star rating because the rating would have been biased, so instead he gave more, or less of a recap of information and what putting together the final film was like in general. John Waters' Pink Flamingos (which I would also consider a cult masterpiece) was one that Ebert felt that he could not give a star rating to because he felt that a rating system did not belong, or would not be acceptable for such a film. If you have seen, Pink Flamingos (and every lover of the offbeat really should), you can definitely see what he is talking about. The film, while I still like it very much, is extremely offbeat and you could use any number of adjectives to describe it (whether you liked it, or not), but to rate it as one of the great films of all time, or even what to rate it at all, would prove definitely a perplexing and difficult problem for some. I would personally give perfect ratings to both Dolls, and Flamingos, and I personally own both films and consider them and look at them very highly. Yet bizarrely, I find I am running into Ebert's dilemma when it comes to Mad Max: Fury Road though. I simply do not know how to rate it. As my alias on this site suggests, I am definitely a fan of all films offbeat, misunderstood and stuff that the general public has shied away from. So why am I finding it so hard to give a rating to Mad Max: Fury Road, which definitely falls into a lot of those categories? I think part of this is while I certainly did find a lot I liked in Mad Max: Fury Road, and in general, I would have to say that I did like the film, I think part of the dilemma for me is that this is an action film and very few action films rank very highly, or favourably in my palette of taste for films. To say that, Mad Max: Fury Road is not an action packed film would be the understatement of the year because from the second the film opens till it ends, it is action packed from start to finish and sometimes is so over the top in it's action and violence and often even it's fast editing style which jumped from scene to scene as if filmed by a madman, reminded me of Russ Meyer's own editing style, which was very similar only he never really made a film like this and this editing feels like Russ Meyer's style with a day's worth of coffee and energy drinks thrown in. Before, I run out of space to write, I must say what I liked and disliked about this film to be a proper reviewer. Basically, there was nothing I did not like. Even though the action genre is definitely not my thing (never has been, never will be), I still liked Mad Max: Fury Road and found things to like and dare I say, even admire about the film. My biggest compliments probably come on the technical side of the film. The cinematography capturing a post apocalyptic wasteland and showing all the gritty and barren backgrounds to the absolutely and sometimes hideously looking people inhabiting this space, was all very well done. The makeup, costumes and cinematography was all first rate in every single way. The editing (which I described above) is also extremely impressive and worthy of praise here as well. The acting is definitely not award worthy, but I felt all these actors did really hold their own and did a decent enough job here. What, I really found impressive and an admirable trait for this film, was that a major studio like Warner Bros, would go to all the efforts to get this film made and spend one hundred fifty million dollars to do so, is an incredible feat and I am impressed that a major studio would shell out that kind of money for a film so offbeat and definitely bizarre as this one. Warner Bros and other major studios would do that type of thing all the time back in the day, but now unfortunately it is becoming more and more uncommon. Perhaps with this film there is still hope for Hollywood yet. As it stands, I will not give this film a star rating because I don't feel I can, but I did definitely enjoy the film and it certainly never left me bored for it's two hour running time.",Null,4,10,23 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Hacksaw Ridge
","Mel Gibson's new directorial effort, Hacksaw Ridge, is not only one of the best war movies of recent years (some are saying the best since Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, which I would agree with), but it is also a rare film of courage, standing true to what one believes in and is ultimately an excellent and encouraging story of one man's Christian faith and the decision to go to war as a medic and yet refuse to carry a gun, or use or deploy any acts of violence whatsoever based on his beliefs. Our main character Desmond Doss, is brought up in a home where there is a fair bit of dysfunction largely based on the father's difficulty with what was then horrific memories and reflections of the first world war in which he served and which now causes him much pain and sorrow leading him to use alcohol as a means of trying to heal his wounds in what would today be considered as post traumatic stress disorder. While there is fighting and arguments among the Doss household, Desmond does cling to his Christian faith and even as an adult carries those beliefs with him even while enlisting to go to war. Desmond's idea is to be a war medic and save lives instead of killing others as he considered himself to be a conscientious objector and was totally opposed to violence and killing based on his strong Christian beliefs. Desmond while at boot camp and training to go to war is often made fun of verbally and also attacked physically for what the other soon to be soldiers did not understand and took to be an act of cowardice and oh how Desmond would prove them wrong. Desmond was certainly persecuted for his beliefs and his faith, but the absolutely amazing thing is that he never denounced his faith, or wanted to give up and he kept persevering even though it brought about condemnation and laughs and jeers from others. This is not giving any spoilers away, but Desmond does make it to the war and through praying and keeping true to the word of God as well as obeying the fellow soldiers and ultimately having the outlook of loving your neighbour as yourself he does far more than any of his fellow soldiers thinks he is capable of and truly proves himself to be a hero not only as a soldier and medic, but also as a true Christian soldier and one who placed God first and foremost in his life and would not disobey on the battlefield, or more importantly to the God who saw him through these personal and physical battles and would ultimately see him not only rewarded for his faith and devotion, but also Desmond truly becomes a wonderful example to his fellow soldiers and those in command of what a great Christian witness he is and one that the other soldiers because of his example that they would not soon forget. The film while very violent at times especially in it's second half should not stop viewers from seeing and embracing this inspiring and truly inspirational film and true story. This is not just simply a war film, but a man's own personal war against the people and powers that be that tried to suppress him and his faith only to be proved wrong and ultimately giving God the true and total glory that he deserves through Desmond's wonderful example and act of courage and faith. This film is about as good as you can get these days and everything here is done to sheer perfection from the outstanding acting to the war scenes to the makeup, sets and everything done to capture not only the period elements of the time, but also to not only take us to those battle lines, but make us feel as if we were right there and experiencing them for ourselves. There were some scenes that were so realistic that there were certainly times I jumped out of my seat in pure terror and other scenes were I was so deeply engrossed into the film and it's story as well. I hope that the R rating and the more graphic violence does not keep people away, but instead that people give this film a chance and be totally encouraged and yet blown away by the sheer power and yet beautiful nature of this amazing film. I hope that those who have written Mel Gibson off for comments he made ten years ago, can look past that and judge the man's art and not the man himself because he truly made a masterpiece with this film and it not only stands as one of this year's finest films, but also shows that good movies can still be made these days and I hope this film takes off and not only inspires, but truly shows what a Hollywood production can still do in the proper hands and that they can still achieve greatness. One of this year's best films.",10,8,15,5 November 2016
The Social Network," The Social Network
","The Social Network is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich and follows Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg as he creates what is now one of the most visited websites and forms of social networking ever entitled Facebook.The film shows the socially awkward and acid tongued Mark Zuckerberg as he creates the website and after time he keeps getting more and more members signing up and joining it and after it becomes a big success that is when the different lawsuits come out. I am not a particularly really tech friendly person. I know how to use parts of a computer and the internet, but if you were to ask me to build a website from scratch, design anything, or anything to do with coding I am completely lost. The Social Network does talk about how they create the site and some big technical words may come your way, but it is not the whole film and doesn't leave those who are unfamiliar with it confused and not able to get into what is going on in the film. There is so much I absolutely loved and adored about The Social Network that I will try and remember it all and get it into this review. First off the direction is great. Yes this is a Hollywood big budget movie, but it does not feel like one. Because the film itself is pretty dark the atmosphere and mood set by the director is more low key and has a haunting and at times macabre look to it that suits the going on happenings of the characters around. When, I talk about this I do not mean to say that The Social Network is a horror film, but instead that in other ways it is disturbing and very dark and the dim lighting and use of what I guess would be fluorescent lights to give some scenes a haunting glow, I thought was pulled off perfectly and set the tone for the film really well. The script to the film is amazing for several reasons. It takes a true life story that in the hands of another director, or script writer could have become a fairly unoriginal biopic, but instead it breathes life and there is so much energy here. The characters, or at least a lot of them in the film have very rich vocabularies and they tend to talk very fast, but just listening to some of these conversations is fascinating because of the quick wit of some of the characters and what they say as well as some of the awkwardness around it as well because a lot of these characters have very poor social skills (is that why they created a social networking site?). The script which goes back and forth from the characters at school to talking with the lawyers during the lawsuit is all absolutely fascinating and with the quick jump cut editing it feels fresh, alive and something that we do not see all that often. The acting from Jesse Eisenberg who plays Mark Zuckerberg is a brilliant performance because of his smug arrogance as well as his sharp wit and acid tongued speech to his social awkwardness. It's all here in this performance and it's great. At the same time all of the supporting characters do a great job as well. The Social Network not only looks at the creation of one of the biggest and most profitable websites of all time, but also shows the decline of today's youth. The teenagers and young adults that are portrayed in the film all have huge egos and are really egocentric, narcissistic and nihilistic. They care for themselves and themselves only and in some ways will do whatever it takes to succeed. In it's own way, perhaps the creation of Facebook has led to some of this. Instead of talking to a friend, or family member on the phone, you now all do it on Facebook and you lose that sense of personal touch and the relationship to the person. The conversations one has on the internet or cell phones is a lot different than it used to be and illiteracy and bad grammar and English skills are on the rise and is some of these sites to blame? The film also looks at these dangerously empty lives of these young adults who try and fill in what is missing with drugs, alcohol, sex and money, but we see that they are never really happy and continue to lead an empty existence. The film is a brilliant character study in that way. I found myself loving The Social Network from close to the beginning right up to the end and the film lingered with me. I thought about it and what I would tell others and say in this review about it. The film is powerfully and masterfully made with an enormous amount of talent behind it. Mark my words in years and decades from now The Social Network will still be watched and talked about by a lot of people and will go down in history as one of the best films of all time. The way it captures the mood and feel of today's youth is brilliant and is a real eye opener while being tremendously entertaining at the same time. This is one of the best films I have seen in quite awhile and I think it is safe to say also that it is one of the best films I have ever seen.",10,7,14,3 October 2010
The Great Gatsby," The Great Gatsby
","The Great Gatsby, based upon the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is probably a book a lot of you, or at least most of you, probably read in one of your high school English classes. I was in a split class one year, where one grade was taking the novel and the other one was not, so unfortunately to this day I have never read the book, but as a treat for the class the teacher showed both grades in the split class the 1974 film version of the novel by Jack Clayton, and starring Robert Redford, and Mia Farrow. Most of the class, well pretty much all of it, really disliked the film, but I was one of the few who really enjoyed it. To this day the only Fitzgerald novel that I have read is Tender is the Night, and I also saw the 1985 television miniseries of the novel with Peter Strauss, and Mary Steenburgen, and I quite enjoyed it. Part of me was somewhat concerned about this new Gatsby version with it's pricey budget and the fact that it was shot in 3D and also delayed in release a couple of months for re-shoots. Fortunately, the film met and surpassed all of my expectations. What, I really loved about the film was not the 3D look, or feel to it, which was okay, but I found neither added, or really took anything away from the film, but what I really loved was the general message that Fitzgerald and the screenwriters were trying to say with this film and I suppose with the original novel as well. Gatsby, is such a mysterious person who throws huge lavish parties that must cost a fortune and all the big names and socialites in town are there, partying it up and having a great time, but few really know Gatsby, or even what he looks like. How, Gatsby got through to an average everyday man like Nick Carraway, is in it's own way fascinating and kind of heartfelt as well. We see Gatsby, as a mighty man with a vast fortune and power and he can pretty much do anything he wants, or acquire, or buy anything with a price tag on it, but the one thing that he does not have and which I think is sorely lacking in his life and he knows it, is love. He puts on heirs, dresses in the best clothes and throws these huge parties, but I think in a sense this is all trying to compensate for his loneliness and to buy approval from others. He is never really thanked for his parties and nobody ever really seems to make too big a fuss about him until Nick comes along. We can see why Nick is so much in adoration of Gatsby. He learns of Gatsby's tales and how he made a name for himself in the world, but is humble and kind deep down and really in need of friendship and love. There was one scene in the film, that I can not say too much about because I do not want to give it away, but it revolves around the reunion between two characters in this film and just the way the scene is set up with the direction, acting, music and the way it was scripted really hit home for me. Not so much because I have been in a similar situation, but because this situation that the characters had between each other felt real, somewhat awkward and at the same time, beautiful. I was extremely moved on several different occasions during this film and I do not think the tender emotion, or some of Fitzgerald's philosophies and character critiques were lost here in translation with the big budget and with the 3D. The film in it's own way is very sad in it's own right as well and what is especially sad about these scenes and events are because it is so typical of mankind and society, not just at that period of time, but throughout the ages and even happening this very day. How some people just crave money and living the life of luxury and fame and wealth and how they do not care who they hurt, or how they go about getting there. Gatsby, with all his wealth and fame, still remains humble and an exceptional human being, but the others around him are all unfortunately in it for themselves and nobody else, which ultimately ends up with the sad part of the film and the heartbreak. The Great Gatsby, works so well because even though it takes place in the 1920's it could really take place anytime because it's theme and message is one that still rings true to this day. Heroes, antiheroes and everyday people are shown here, warts and all and I loved that about the film. The film looks epic and lush and is pleasing to the eye, the acting is all very impressive as is the direction and adapted screenplay. It shows the downside to America at that time and time over the decades and that unfortunately sometimes nice guys do really finish last. An excellent expose of human nature as well as an emotionally moving and entertaining journey through that. One of the year's best.",10,2,5,13 May 2013
The Simpsons Movie," The Simpsons Movie
","The Simpsons Movie is a full length feature film based on the animated series that has become one of the longest running and most popular television shows of all time. For years the film's producers said they were going to make a movie and they finally did. Originally back in the early 90's they were going to make a movie that didn't end up happening and the idea for the movie later ended up being the Kamp Krusty episode of the series which also remains probably the episode with the shortest running time in the whole series. I have been pretty much a fan of the show from the beginning, although I do have to add that over the last few years the newer episodes with a new team of writers is just not nearly as good as the first several years of the show back in the 90's because those episodes were television gold. These new episodes seem to get more far fetched as they go along and being a fan of the absurd and weird, I usually wouldn't have a problem with that, but with the new episodes it gets to the point where it isn't clever or funny anymore and it is just ridiculous and growing out it's welcome quick. With that being said I found some things I did like about The Simpsons Movie and some things that I didn't like. It took me awhile to go into the film simply because I didn't find much or most of the film for that matter very funny at all and most of the jokes I felt just didn't deliver the punch line as it should have and after only a little while I was growing a bit restless of the film because I wasn't finding it funny, it was getting old and like the new episodes it was too unbelievable to the point of being just annoying. Also it seems over the years and with this film too that most of the humour comes from Homer Simpson doing things that are really stupid and these scenes seem to generate the most laughs. As pointed out in a special episode of the series, someone did point out that Homer seems to get dumber as the show goes on and I would have to agree and some of it just isn't funny anymore and it is getting a bit tired, old and just not as entertaining as it used to be. Those were my main complaints about the film. On the other hand, I did seem to warm up to the film in it's second half and I tended to just watch the film for what it was which is basically a long episode of the show and it's not meant for any real deep thought or purpose other than entertainment. So overall I did get into the film with it's second half and it did entertain me. However the film was still somewhat a disappointment and I wish it would have been as good as some of the original episodes from the 90's and I guess I was hoping it would be seeing as many of the original writers are back for the movie. So all in all the film was entertaining, but I was still somewhat disappointed and if there were a sequel to this movie I don't know how interested I would be in seeing it.",7,1,2,11 August 2007
The Fighter," The Fighter
","The Fighter is based on the true story of Mickey Ward, who hopes to become a boxer as his older brother Dicky used to be quite good and was even in a huge fight on television that earned him a lot of respect. Dicky now these many years later is a crack addict and also Mickey's trainer, but he can never get to their training sessions on time and also a lot of the time he is burned out and oblivious to what is going on around him. Mickey's mother Alice, is his manager, but so far Mickey's fights haven't been all that successful and he longs for more. After meeting a feisty bar waitress named Charlene, she gives Mickey confidence and helps analyze the situation and helps him realize his true potential to become a champion fighter, but if he is to be successful he may have to do it without his family behind him because as Charlene sees it, they are holding him back more than anything and not really helping. The Fighter is a movie about boxing as I said above and about someone trying to become a boxer, but you do not have to know anything about the sport of boxing to enjoy this movie because that is only one aspect of the story. I personally am not really into sports, so if this film had just been a lot of sports manoeuvres and long drawn out boxing matches, I can imagine that it would not have been for me, but the way they put it together made me love what I was watching and earned a huge amount of respect from me after I had watched it. Mickey grew up in a rough side of town with seven sisters, a crack addicted brother who is continually getting into different forms of trouble and they just live a different type of lifestyle. They smoke and swear continuously and there is a great amount of dysfunction in this family. I am glad that this film did not shy away from those parts, but instead focused on them and made them an important part of the story. Yes at times the film is quite gritty and earthy and even at times disturbing, but it feels real and generates real emotion in us the viewers. If this had been a big glamorous Hollywood project with big production values and everything a little more flashy and slick I could not have seen the film having the same impact that it does now the way they did it. We also get to see the family interact and although there is so much dysfunction and even a bit of greed in them, I think deep down they do really want what is best for each other, but they just have to find that out first and discover it inside themselves. The story here is terrific. It gives us great character depth and study of all the main characters and does what I like best in these type of films, when they show the heroes, or main characters of these films and do not cover up their flaws and weaknesses, but instead put them on display and work with those elements to further enhance the story and make it believable. The film has a great pace and is absolutely riveting to watching. The direction is handled very well here as is the screenplay and it comes off beautifully from these top notch actors and their performances. Everyone is so good in this film in the different roles and personas they have to portray. For example, Christian Bale really gets into the look and the face and body language of a drug addict and at times it looks a little interesting, but he also shows us how tragic it is and that we really need to care for this character and all the emotion and work he puts into this performance is brilliant. I think of all the films I have seen Christian Bale in thus far, I would go as far as to say that this is so far his best performance in what will be a very long career. Also do not be surprised if he wins a Supporting Actor Oscar next year because he is truly deserving and I can not think of too many other male performances this year that were just as good, or even better. The supporting cast is all great here as well and also deserving of praise. This film will draw you in, fascinate you and take you on a roller coaster of emotions, but it is one you will be glad you went to see. Along with The Social Network, The Fighter is so far the best American film I have seen of 2010. Granted, I still have a lot to see, but this is a perfect film and in boxing terms a real knock out. Go see it at once.",10,4,7,19 December 2010
Up in the Air," Up In The Air
","Up In The Air is about a middle aged man named Ryan Bingham, who works for a large company who has hired Ryan, along with many others to professionally let people go of their jobs. Ryan, will fly all across America and is paid by other companies to do their dirty work, which in this case, is letting go of employees. Ryan has been doing this for years and feels he has a certain technique and style to it. He also doesn't have a place of residence other than a hotel room and otherwise most days of the year he is on airplanes, travelling and in various assorted hotel rooms. Ryan also does professional speeches on how to lose baggage (for example relationships and stress that goes along with it). Ryan seems like the perfect person to deliver these types of speeches because he has not one bit of baggage. He has never been married and has no real emotional connections and claims to like it that way. Things change however, after he meets a woman while at one of the hotels. Her name is Alex, and after meeting a couple times, Ryan starts to decide, whether or not he should eventually get over his fear, or dislike of commitment and finally do something in that area of his life. Another part of the story focuses on Ryan's new co-worker named Natalie, who is an overly confident young woman, who goes on the road, or should I see in the air, with Ryan to different destinations to learn how to fire people properly. At least that is what Ryan calls it. The film looks at many different kinds of relationships and characteristics of these characters and also is right on time with it's back story of letting go of employees due to the current financial recession being felt all over the world. Up In The Air works for several reasons. One, I think is the well layered characters here. For example, Ryan the main character. He comes off as quite sure of himself and what he is doing and many people seem to think he is quite happy with his lifestyle and the choices he has made. However as we watch the film we start to realize that maybe that is just a front he is putting on and deep down he is a sad and lonely person and perhaps scared to commit to any kind of relationship, perhaps out of fear and because he is so used to his lifestyle and change is never easy. Alex and Natalie are well developed characters as well and we get to see more about them through the film and it is just as intriguing and interesting to watch as with Ryan's character. All of these characters are brought to life by great performances by George Clooney (Ryan), Vera Farmiga (Alex) and Anna Kendrick (Natalie). They are deep and layered performances and we feel as if we have gotten to know these characters quite well after watching them, but on the plus side, there is also some mystery left to them, which leads the viewer to some intriguing thoughts and deconstruction of the film after being viewed. Count on Oscar nominations for all three acting performances. The film's script is also a winner blending in comedy, tragedy and real life melodrama. Not once does the film feel unrealistic, or sugar coated and it is one of the more believable and realistic films dealing with relationships in the past little while and because there are no easy answers to these characters, or their situations, I think the way they are handled is very appropriate. And again the depth and layers to these characters plus some good dialogue and occasional humour lead to a sure to be nominated best adapted screenplay as well as best director for Jason Reitman. Up In The Air is a powerful film in many ways. I think for many it will leave us reflecting on our past, or present and think about the situations and current times we are in. It definitely leaves an impact on the viewer and will have you thinking, which I think a great film does. It blends sadness and humour quite well and makes for an intriguing watch. One of the best films of 2009 and will continue to be a winner among the awards circuits and for good reasons too.",10,3,9,3 January 2010
Atonement," Atonement
","Atonement is based upon the novel of the same name by Ian McEwan. The film takes place in 1930's England where a young girl named Briony Tallis witnesses several incidents all in the course of one day and one of them involving her older sister Cecilia and the house's servant Robbie Turner. Not knowing what to make of the events, Briony lies to the authorities in a move that will affect Cecilia and Robbie for the rest of their lives and will also haunt her for the rest of hers as well. This film really is a perfect showcase for the different characters in the story and their emotions, thoughts, feelings and decisions. Going to the authorities and ruining the lives of the people around her are brought on by Briony most likely because as we can see she is brought up into royalty in a very strict, classy and conservative environment and probably has no insight or ideas of what she is later to learn on the night when everything changes. Because she has had such a carefree and in a sense isolated life she has been hidden from these sort of situations and also because of an underlying issue that we learn later in the film is the cause for her harsh and life changing decision she makes by going to the authorities. The film brilliantly captures the different characters at several stages of their life and how the events of the past have hurt them and how they will never be the same because of it. The emotions whether let out or bottled in are really shown by the very talented actors who portray these characters in the film and the film's script gives us a lot to think about and shows us a side of human nature that may seem cruel or ugly, but in most cases is probably more likely than we would like to admit. The story is at times moving, haunting, thought provoking and is paced well especially in the second half and is a film that leaves the viewer with a lot to think about after the initial viewing. Not because the film is in any way particularly confusing, but because of the different social studies of these characters and because of the decisions they make out of ignorance, or for other reasons. The film is set to a beautiful backdrop of wonderful looking cinematography, great sets and costumes that really capture the place and time and a beautiful musical score as well. The real gift of this film besides the very talented people in front of and behind the camera is the script and the book it is based on because it delves into these characters so deeply and shows us their raw and real emotions, flaws and what makes them do the things they do. I personally am one who likes a movie that makes me think and stays with me after I have seen it and this one did that for me. This was a wonderful theatrical version of a great script and novel that is brought to such life and beauty by the great cast and crew behind it. A beautiful, thought provoking and in ways a haunting film that stayed with me and made me want to analyze the film more and more because of these rich characters. This is certainly one of the best films of 2007.",10,4,6,19 January 2008
V for Vendetta," V For Vendetta
","V For Vendetta is based upon the graphic novel by Alan Moore. The film is set in Britain in the future and is about a young woman named Evey who is saved on the streets from a mysterious man in a cape and mask who calls himself V. V stands up for the evil government and leader who is trying to take over. V fights against the evil members of the government and takes Evey under his care to show her his ways and to teach her about what he stands for. V For Vendetta has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by the entire cast (especially Natalie Portman who plays Evey), good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction and good set decoration. The film took a little while for me to get into it and at times throughout the film there were things I found complicated and didn't totally understand, but overall I liked this movie. It's a good looking and stylish film and it has a very original plot and ideas. The film is entertaining and eventually starting to draw me into the film more and more. The film is classy and stylish and has lots of great atmosphere and some good action sequences that feel like this is almost a comic book come to life. The past few years there have been many good films based on comics and graphic novels such as Sin City or Batman Begins and this film looks and feels like a comic book and the people who made this movie made it right and the film is a great visual accomplishment and is very entertaining as well. An original and compelling film that should appeal to action and science fiction fans of all kinds.",7,0,3,18 March 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Talladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby
","Talladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby is about a professional race car driver named Ricky Bobby who seems to have everything perfect in his life because he always wins the big races. Soon a new French driver comes into town and threatens to take Ricky Bobby's top spot. Ricky Bobby seems to be losing his fans and the people he cares about because he is not racing and he soon decides to give it up entirely, but thanks to the help of his seldom seen father Ricky Bobby plans to get back in the race and win and also prove to everyone that he still has what it takes to be a great driver. Talladega Nights has good direction, a good script, good comedic performances by the entire cast and good film editing. I'm not into racing myself, but that did not stop me one bit from enjoying this movie. I didn't find the movie particularly funny either, but that did not stop me from enjoying it either. The film is entertaining and all the actors are at the top of their game delivering great comedic performances and the writing of the script was well done and allows the viewer to have a lot of fun. I liked how the film was very entertaining and throughout the film you begin to care about Ricky Bobby and want to see him accomplish his goal and get back into the race in win. Very many comedies these days allow you to care or see a more simpler side to a character and this film does this even while being a comedy and I think it was pulled off well. I also liked some of the more heartfelt scenes in the film and I thought those worked too. At the end of this film I was cheering for Ricky Bobby and wanted to seem him succeed and I think another good thing about this film was that the characters were very well written which does more than just allow us to like or dislike them, but instead as I said earlier to feel for them and want them to do well. Also, I'd like to note that just because I didn't find the film funny doesn't mean that you won't. I just felt that most of the jokes were given away in the film's trailer. Having said that this film is still one of the best comedies of the summer and it is very entertaining and the heartfelt stuff really worked for me and as a whole I was very pleased with this movie and I don't think fans of Will Ferrell, his films or the comedy genre will be disappointed.",8,1,4,23 August 2006
