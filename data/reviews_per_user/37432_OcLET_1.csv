Alien 3," Don't tell me about production problems
","The essence of a good review is not to give people a lecture on the making of a movie. It is to tell people if the movie is good or bad. The sordid production history of this POS should not influence in any way your opinion about its quality. We should always look at the end result, and in the case of Alien3 it is one of the worst sequels ever made. The script is incredibly dull with lots of plot holes and drag, the actors' performances are poor, Weaver is really really bad, the effects are atrocious even for a movie from 1992 (compared to brilliant contemporary movies such as Terminator 2 or Jurassic Park), and there is not a single moment of suspense in the entire movie. A shoddy piece of horror fiction that should have never been released, but the greedy studio couldn't keep their hands of this great Sci-Fi Duology.",1,5,7,12 May 2009
