Scarface," Greatest Gangsta Movie Ever
","I remember seeing Scarface when it first came out and being absolutely mesmerized by it.  I have to say that the cursing somewhat bothered me at the time, but it doesn't seem that extreme compared to a lot of films today.The chainsaw scene in the motel will ALWAYS stick in my mind.  I thought that was one of the most terrifying scenes I had ever seen on film.Al Pacino is unbelievable, at times a little over the top, but I think maybe that was intentional.This was Michelle Pfeiffer's first big breakout role.  After this one, the parts started pouring in.  I love her performance in this, especially the coke speech in the restaurant.For you gen-Y youngsters out there, you don't realize how brilliant filmmaking was in the 70's and 80's, before it was spoiled by the moronic big studio mentality of today.  You can criticize this film, but this was very daring and provocative stuff compared to the pap produced today.I'm a woman, and I love violent gangster movies.  This is one of the best ones ever.  I like it much better than the Godfather films.",Null,0,0,12 September 2000
The Birth of a Nation," Is Art Supposed to be Politically Correct?
","As a native southerner, I resent the implication that all southerners are racist.  The north did IN FACT brutally destroy the south out of misguided arrogance.  What they did to the south was FAR worse than a lot of the propagandized conditions of slavery, which was already on the way out anyway.Art and this film should be judged on artistic standards, not on political correctness.  And IDMB, I'll be very surprised if you print this comment, since you tend to delete all of my comments that are controversial or unsugar coated. Yeah, this is a challenge, and I'm sure you won't rise to the occasion.",Null,2,8,15 December 1999
The Patriot," Good Grief, all you PC people...
","I think some of the comments about The Patriot are just a reflection of the politically correct, brain washed, ignorant times that we live in.  And also a reflection of the majority of people in this country who have NO appreciation for what our founding fathers died for.Does every person living in this century KNOW beyond a doubt that EVERY black slave suffered horribly and had a miserable life?  Isn't it a possibility that some of them could have been treated well?  Isn't it a possibility that every Indian on the frontier wasn't slaughtered by the big, evil white man?  Isn't it a REAL fact that many, many Indians SLAUGHTERED, needlessly, white men who immigrated here?  Do you people not know that African slaves were sold into slavery by their fellow Africans, that many of them who came here were criminals?  And that it was the Spanish who created the slave trade, not the Americans?  And that the Africans had their own system of slavery in Africa?  And that the Indians brutally tortured and killed each other in times of war, and also took white men as war prisoners?I don't understand what all this PC stuff has to do with a movie about a war that CREATED this FREE country.It's sort of like American citizens biting the hands that feed them.  And in that time, war was considered a fact of life -- a means of survival. 
It's almost like some of these reviewers wish that we had never fought, at least in their unrealistic PC minds, the American revolution.  Then they wouldn't have had the opportunity to live in the greatest country that has ever existed. I guess it's not PC to talk about history at all, unless it's degrading the evil American white man, who in their cloistered minds, is the only race that has ever done anything wrong in the history of the universe.
All you PC'ers are TOTALLY missing the point!",Null,0,1,7 July 2000
