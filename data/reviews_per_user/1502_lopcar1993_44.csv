Angels & Demons," A die hard fan is please and here's why
","This movie is not like the book, and it doesn't pretend to be. No this film is meant to give you a whole new adventure and perspective of Langdon's first adventure. Angels & Demons was an awesome book it was earth shattering in the way it told Langdon's powerful rise from a world renowned symbologist to literary hero.The source material for this film is not as popular as the one for the DaVinci Code, and that's is the main reason this film wasn't as well received by fans as the first, but this adventure is all the more better and has much of the things that the first film had to leave out as to tell the story. Like twice the suspense, twice the action and twice the fun. All In Angles & Demons delivers what the should have, a fun and action packed adventure.Tom Hanks gives another amazing performance as the hard working and extremely intelligent symbologist that never seems to get a real day off, this film shows us an older and more reverent Robert Langdon, it shows us that Langdon has gone trough much change since his first adventure in Paris and London. We get to see Langdon become a full fledged hero instead of just some teacher trying to clear his name of murder. Now we have Langdon do what he does best, solving a 500 year old riddle and stopping an ancient secret society from destroying the Vatican.This film is not fast paced as the trailer makes it to appear, it's a very mild paced film with some very fast and sweeping moments that you have to come back a second time just to see those parts again. But if you give this film a chance I know it will please you, I know there's no changing the minds some of the die hard fans but for those that have read the novel and are willing to give the film adaption a shot I can promise you, form being a fan of the novel myself that this film will not disappoint, it'll give you what you came for and a little more.Angels & Demons is near- perfect and will have to go down as one of the best films of 2009 and is perfect summer entrainment for all people. And it delivers.",5,8,18,30 June 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Better than the first, much better
","This far more action packed and stylized film reboot is more angry and action packed than the cerebral and slower 2003's Ang Lee directed Hulk( which I prefer over this one.) The Incredible Hulk is very fast paced and hurtles trough it's story at lighting fast speed ( which doesn't hinder the film at all.) the pace makes it easier and harder to follow, what makes it hard is the fact that it just doesn't take it's time to explain allot of the minor details and explore the story more.On the flip what makes it easier is that it's complete fun form beginning to end and has a likable and well know actor at the helm as the main character, namely Edward Norton. Who did an exceptional job as Bruce Banner, Norton had the right mannerisms that Dr. Banner had in the comic. He put the his obsession with getting rid of the Hulk, he put his strong love for Betty Ross and his hatred for General Ross in there too.But here was one thing they didn't put much effort into Norton's Banner, his genius. This reboot focused more on the action then the story of it all, but hat doesn't mean this was a bad film, no in fact this was a well made and well acted comic book film. Louis Leterier directs an exceptional cast to a whole new level of action and style in the incredible Hulk. This reboot should not be looked down on it's great fun and very well done,albeit it's got more of the 80's series in then the comic's, but still nothing to frown upon. All in all The Incredible Hulk is just what the title says, Incredible and is definitely worth the watch.",6,3,7,29 April 2009
Minority Report," The future of Sci-Fi
","Minority Report is an exceptional piece of work, another great movie form Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise that shows you a whole new side to the Sci-Fi world. Minority report tells the story of John Anderson, the head of a experimental division that catches criminals before they commit the crime.All things are going well until someone sets Anderson up for murder. Now He's got one chance to clear his name try to find who set him up and why. Minority Report is an amazing film steeped in outstanding special effects and an amazing story based on the short story by the legendary king of Sci-Fi Phillip K. Dick, Tom Cruise is in top form and delivers one of his best and most potent action performances, solidifying why he is one of the best in the business. This film is an amazing example that shows what would happen if we had the power to prevent crimes before they would ever committed. IT shows that a power like that should never be used, but it could also be a benefit to our society. Minority Report is an exceptional Sci-Fi ride that you just don't want to miss. it's a movie that will keep you coming back to it for more.",10,0,1,1 April 2009
Star Trek," The best of the best!!
","When I walked into this movie I didn't have very high expectation's, now I'm no Trekkie but I use to watch Star Trek:The Next generation and Star trek: Voyager when I was a kid. I never really got into to them very much and even watching the original Star Trek I still wasn't much of a fan, but after seeing this movie I definitely am.J.J. Abrams Star Trek is basically taking us all the way back to before the U.S.S. Enterprise set out on it's first fateful voyage, it takes us back to the roots of Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew. Giving us an in depth look at the origins of one of the most popular T.V. Series of all time. This film does to the Star Trek series what X-Men Origins: Wolverine did for the X-Men series, it gives us a starting point, something to work from, something for fans to see how these famous character's came to be. And for people who have never seen the series, it gives them something to start with. It gives them a chance to experience a movie that is literally out of this world. Star Trek is a space tripping, mind blowing Sci-Fi adventure that is something all long time Trekkie's and non-fan's alike can enjoy and love. Star Trek will boldly take you where you've never gone before, and show you a world like you've never experienced.",10,3,12,27 May 2009
Underworld," One of the best Action-Horror films ever made !
","Underworld put's a whole new spin on the vampire/Lycan story line and takes us to a world the likes we've never seen before. Underworld stars Kate Beckinsale as Selene, a beautiful and ruthless vampire assassin(Know as death dealer's)) she has hated the Lycans for as long as she has lived, know Selene and the other death dealers have hunted the lycans to the brink of extinction. Or so they believe. Underworld is a sleek and stylish horror thriller that is sure to captivate and amaze, it doesn't matter how many times you seen it. Kate Beckinsale does an amazing job in the movie you can't stop watching. Underworld blends a sort of Gothic, graphic novel feel to it. It's like the film 'Sin City', except a little less sinful. This film uses a style that didn't become overly popular until such movies as 'Sin City' or 'The Dark Knight' but stands on it's own two feet with the dark and mysterious theme to it. Very few horror films can ever follow this style; or even live up to the style of this film, because it's so unique and different that you can't do anything but love it even those who say they hated it secretly own a copy of this film and don;t want anyone to know. That's what it is, it's a film that you don't tell anyone you've seen and if you have you say you hate it when you secretly love it. This is a guilty pleasure film, and a excellent one at that. Underworld may be forgot in 20 year or so, but those who went to see it and bothered to buy it will always remember it for what it was.",7,0,0,26 January 2009
Public Enemies," Amazing crime film!! One of the year's best
","You know Gangster flicks have lost there touch over the years, they've become more and more attuned to the times and they've lost the real true sense of what a Gangster movie use to be. This film is a throwback to an Era and a style of film making long lost to time itself.Public Enemies chronicles one of Prohibitions greatest and most notorious criminals. John Dillinger. This film was a breath of fresh air in the fact that it didn't use the things that have become so common in Crime films or even modern Gangster epics at that, It doesn't use pervasive language or Violence, it doesn't use strong sexuality(which in some is needed and some not so much.) and it also doesn't use constant drug use . It's done old school so that you can enjoy your time watching it while not being turned off by it at the same time, it's great on many levels It's kinetic energy and wild bank robberies and chases make it fun and really cool to watch. But what made this a great film is the fantastically crafted story and script by Michael Mann and his team it is thanks to him that this movie is elevated high above the regular gangster movie and shoots off into movie greatness.Johnny Depp(who doesn't seem to stop blowing my mind.) pulls another ace out of his sleeve and makes this movie one of his best and one of cinema's best. His portrayal of Dillinger is both smart and ruthless , cunning and slick it is he who brings up the caliber of this film and makes it so great to watch unfold in front of you. Christian Bale( needs to get an Oscar.) Does exceptional as the relentless blood hound of an FBI agent Melvin Purvis, his smart and unflinchingly ruthless portrayal of Dillinger's enemy is nothing short of breathtaking and brilliant. Marion Cotillard(who I never heard of before this movie.) Is not as good as I thought she could be, seeing as she won an Oscar, she kind of dragged in some places and was kind of not the strong willed type she fit the more ' I need to be taken care of' type, but none the less she did alright. But all in all the great cast holds up nicely and pulls no punches or stops to make this a fantastic film.Public Enemies is possibly one of the year's best films(No Transformer's II does not count.) It's smart, witty, clever, dangerously addictive, well played out and exceptionally well acted. It's again, as I say, a film to be relished and admired for it's style and atmospheric sense of honor to the 30's, Michael Mann creates yet another great entry in film history and can now be looked upon as one of cinema's great directors his film is nothing short of genius and bold and if you see it I can promise you it will deliver a great movie going experience. All in all Public Enemies delivers.",8,0,2,16 October 2009
The Mummy," An awesome adventure flick
","The Mummy is not an Oscar worthy film, but it is a great one at that. The Mummy is a remake of the 1932 original( also produced by Universal studios) the original Mummy stared Boris Karloff as Imhotep, but the difference between the original and the remake is that the story and some of the character's are different but the the mummy remains the same, all be it the visual effects are much better now then they were then but the basic plot of both the movies mostly remain the same. The Mummy stars Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah as a group of Egyptologist searching for an ancient city lost beneath the sand a century ago. without warning or regrade for what they have done they released a 3,000 year old mummy for his grave. Now them and a group of ancient warriors have to stop Imhotep from engulfing the world in total darkness for all time. The mummy is a completely engrossing horror thriller with some of the best visual effect ever seen, it's one of those film you'll be watching over and over again. And it will never get old no matter how many times you watch it.",10,1,2,9 February 2009
500 Days of Summer," Off-beat and quirky, smart and charming; all around a great film
","I love Romantic comedies, I love everything about them. The atmosphere, the style, the grace and humor(sometimes they got it sometimes they don't.) They are the very epitome of good fun and romance. But over the years this genre(like I said in my review of The Ugly Truth.) Has been stretched thin and mired down by bad and extremely bland Romantic Comedies that you could see what was going to happen before the film even began. But I'm truly and profoundly proud to say that (500) Days of Summer is nothing even close to the formula of romantic comedies, in fact it's one of the most complex and off beat entries in the genre to come out since in 20 years.This movie I had no interest in seeing at first cause I thought it was just another formula Rom Com and I thought it wouldn't live up to my standards. Boy was I wrong! This movie lived up to my standards and then some. 500 days of summer is clever, smart, funny, honest, heart breaking, touching, sweet and oh so much fun, it's the very core of a great Rom Com and it has the heart of a great romantic drama to boot. It's a film that won't disappoint you and it may change how you see life and love . I know it confirmed my beliefs on both. All in all this film was fantastic in it's execution of the story of a boy meet's girl, boy falls in love with girl, but girl doesn't fall in love with boy; it's so unique in it's portrayal of how love and fate sometimes don't come easy and that sometimes you find love when you least expect it. Or even looking for it for that matter. It was great on some many levels it just made me feel so good and feel so bad at the same time( which is unique fro a Rom Com.) And there lies the keys to it's success and it's unflinchingly honest portrayal of how love really works.Joseph Gordon-Levitt( Who I like, but has never made a movie that I liked besides Miracle at Saint Anna's.) really shows his stuff and proves he can really pull off a dramatic and comedic performance( In the same film! Which is very hard.) He brings a warm and very touching side to his character and he doesn't do it with grace or style but with the honesty of a regular Joe, which makes his character more likable. Zooey Deschanel( Who I didn't like until now.) makes her character Summer a heart breaker and a breath of fresh air, her character wasn't contrived or over done Summer was simple and plain and that makes her something of an off beat female love interest, but none the less is very effective. All in all the cast does nicely in this gorgeous and brilliant Romantic Dramedy.(500) Days of Summer is very rare as I've said and it's great and undeniable fun that is really and truly needs to be seen to believe . I don't think in all my years of watching movies have I ever been blown away by a Rom Com, but now I guess I can. This film has gone down as one of the best since Sleepless In Seattle but I'm happy to inform you that this movie surpass Sleepless in Seattle and makes that film look bad. It's a great utterly charming good time that is a film that will be remember and cherished for years to come. (500) Days of summer is 500 days you want to be apart of.",10,1,2,17 October 2009
L.A. Confidential," The best Neo-Noir ever made!!!
","I'm a major fan of film noir I love everything about the mood , the dim lighting, the dark colors and the dark story but I'm here to tell you that this film has none of those qualities. You see this film is what you call a neo-noir it's not exactly a film noir but it also is at the same time. L.A. Confidential is what you call a masterpiece among crime films it's so perfect, so well done and so well acted to the point you don't even realize that your watching a film, you see when you watch L.A. your living a film which is something of very extreme rarity and pleasure.When this film was released in 1997 nobody was interested in it and from it's box office opening it showed. But after just a week in theaters this film started to rack up the dough although it could have made allot more than what it did L.A. Confidential was a moderate box office success but it's popularity didn't stop, no this films fame and didn't end with it's theatrical run it soon became an instant Saturday night favorite and a landmark film effectively jump starting the 'Neo-Noir' genre and ushering in a whole new era of crime films, many films have tried to copy this style and many have failed( actually all have failed.) but this film has been so widely acclaimed by critics and fans alike that even if you could copy it's style, even if you could mimics it's appeal, even if you could copy the sense of humor and the sense of justice and brilliance that it had you would never be able to capture the awe and glamor that this film has it's so grand and beautiful that if your a filmmaker at heart you'll almost want to cry.L.A. Confidential is perfect in every way imaginable there isn't a single flaw or a single clique that exist in this film and let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film so much and if you have the heart for a period piece crime drama then look no further, this is the film. L.A. Confidential delivers.",10,3,5,27 August 2009
X-Men," One of the best comic book adaption ever made!
","exceptional!! X-Men is perhaps one of the best comic book adaption's ever made It has the style and humor the comic did, plus a little more just for your entertainment. X-men is a very well made, and exceptionally well acted film that will have you on the edge of your seat throughout. And you will also get a good dose of humor too, this film delivers what most comic book films don't, a sturdy well made film that allot of recent comic book films have followed. Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Spider Man, the Fantastic Four. They all follow the example that X-men set up, it's a film that you can look back twenty years from now and still call it the best. It doesn't matter how old you are, or if you even read the comic books or watch the original animated show. X-men is the movie that you'll want to see over and over again. I very highly recommended this great film. I hope my review helps~ C.R. Lopez 1.21.2009",7,0,1,22 January 2009
The Prestige," Amazing film!! One of the best of the decade!!
","I've seen some movies that try to blow your mind, I've seen some movies that try to challenge you and make you believe in the unimaginable. The Prestige does both, it challenges you while making you think you know what is going on and just when you have it all figured out it throws a Monkey wrench into your plans and leaves you totally baffled and dumbfounded even after the ending, so the real question is what is true in this film? and what is a lie? The Prestige Is brilliant, taunt, dark, sinister, sadistic, malicious, vicious need I go on? It's a film that you can revile in and admire for it's complex nature and dark themes. It's one of the most convincing and thought provoking period pieces I've ever seen since Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. It enters your mind and slowly but surely starts to poke at your brain and make you think what you know and believe is nothing but an elaborate hoax, a smoke screen to blind you from the truth that is buried underneath the complexity of this film it brings out the first basic law of life. Kill or be killed. And this film takes that meaning to a whole new extreme it uses treachery, betrayal, murder and deception to fully tell and improve the main basis of the plot and to bring out the dark nature that revenge has on a man's soul. All in all this film is nothing short of a brilliant and taunt masterpiece.Hugh Jackman(who finally makes a great film outside of X-Men.) Brings his acting to whole other world, he pulls no stops to be cruel and vicious. He brings a great darkness the likes we have never seen and an obsessive nature like on other. Christian Bale(Who in my opinion stole the show.) Is another who rocks the house in this film, he brings a more sadistic side than Jackman and really almost out classes him in this film. Bale really steps up his game and brings a whole new level of obsessive rivalry to this movie. But all in all the whole cast does magnificently in this handsomely mounted film.The Prestige is not your average film, it requires strict and complete attention to truly grasp and understand the story and plot. Kind of like The Matrix if you sneeze you will lose what is going on in the film, it's that complex. But when you get to understand it and know it it really is a truly magnificent film and a really treat to watch on screen. But I have just one request if you watch this movie, watch very closely because nothing in this film is what it really seems.",10,2,3,16 March 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," Amazing!! The best film of 2006 hands down
","Alice in Wonderland is one of the most beloved stories of our time, It tells of a young girl who falls down a rabbit hole and get's transported to another world where strange creatures rule and the possibilities of magic and adventure are endless. But it's been nearly 144 years since that story first appeared and ever since then film makers have been trying to tell the story a different way for years, But thanks to Guillermo del Toro we have the greatest spin off of all, El Laberinto del Fauno, or in English, Pan's Labyrinth.Guillermo del Toro has crafted a Fantasy adventure the likes no one has ever seen before, and I know that I've said that before but this film breaks some amazing new grounds in special effects and makeup. It's just a film that you have to seen to really, truly believe because if you love Fantasy and dark, deeply emotional films than this is your ticket. While this film is brilliant in every way imaginable it does have it's downside, The film is very creepy and violent and not suited for children and may leave them with nightmares of the grotesque creatures that are shown in this film. But none the less Pan's Labyrinth is a dark and beautiful film It's one of the most exhilarating movie experiences you will ever have and it's a film you will not forget.The Spanish cast of actors do amazing in this and give this film it's true power and worth, they bring a humanized side to an overall Fantasy movie and bring the stark reality of love, death, cruelty, sorrow and happiness to this film. All in all there fantastic in this film.Pan's Labyrinth is brilliant, dark, engaging, relentlessly entertaining, heart breaking, horrifying and beautiful. It's a film with so much heart and so much loss and amazing fantasy adventure that when the movie starts your sucked into a world where your greatest fantasies live. And where your greatest nightmare's can lie as well It's a bold , new ground of film making that will enchant and blow your mind. All in all Pan's Labyrinth is one adventure you do want to take.",10,2,11,2 November 2009
Gone Baby Gone," Another great entry in the Crime genre
","This movie is what you call a can't miss movie it has all the makings of a great film and let me be say that it is a great crime film at that, probably one of the best since Street Kings and Narc. It's execution and style almost borders on Noir and it does so with oh so much style and grace. Ben Affleck proves that he's as good an actor and screenplay writer(Good Will Hunting) as he is a director. Ben Affleck surpasses his previous screenplay which he won the Oscar for( which was just as good here) and creates an intricately woven and malicious Crime Mystery.When I first heard about this movie I had absolutely no interest in crime films I was more into Sci-Fi then crime. But now after almost three years and finally deciding to see this film I'm glad I did. This crime drama is powerful in it's execution and sinister in it's play on words and scenarios. It moves along like a wicked little machine taking you here and there and everywhere in it's story all the while keeping you totally in tune with the plot and the going on's of the film. It's so wrapped up in it's story that when you start watching it your slowly but surely drawn in and to tell you the truth this movie won't let you out until it's over and done with. This movie has a very well rounded cast of actors that all display there talents above there normal status quot, Casey Affleck is one who stood out in this film his strong performance drove this film and made it something more than just your run of the mill crime film, his performance stole the show him and Ed Harris blew away anything they've done in the past and have made a strong stand here and came out on top. Michelle Monaghan was beautiful as always but she got sandwiched by Cast Affleck and Ed Harris' strong performances and is almost a throw away in the film(which her character was anyways.) Morgan Freeman who's small but pivotal role was not a scene stealer but he did exceptionally well for the time he was on screen.All in all this film is something you can't miss, it's a study in the devious corrupt nature of man and the true meaning of justice for children. It's a film that you can see over and over again and it will still have the same affect as the first time you watched it. It's a devious ride of sin, lies , love and making the right choices even if they affect those around you. Gone Baby Gone is a movie that is going down in the crime section as one of the best of all time, and it rightfully deserves it this films delivers non-stop mystery and deceit that is hypnotizing and engrossing, All in all this is a can't miss thought provoking Crime drama that must be seen to be believed. Gone Baby Gone delivers.",10,0,0,25 September 2009
Watchmen," A mind-blowing conic book wonder!!
","Over hyped? No. A beautiful piece of movie making? Most definitely, the Watchmen is one of the best Anti-hero series ever made. I've had the innate pleasure of reading the graphic novel and I've just seen the movie and let me tell you it was exceptional, the movie had almost captured the graphic novel and completely put it to film, I had never been thus impressed in my entire life by a comic book adaption. The Watchmen tells the story of a group of not so heroic heroes, and as the film states one of them is killed and now the rest have to find out why. The Watchmen is an amazing visual feat that no comic book adaption has ever even come close to before. it has the same feel, the same style that the watchmen graphic novel did and I promise you, fans of the graphic novel will not be disappointed at all by this magnificent film, it's a treat for the eyes and the senses; and will keep you going all the way till the shocking end",10,4,9,31 March 2009
The Italian Job," One of the greatest heist films ever made!!
","The Italian job is an amazing heist film, and probably one of the best remakes ever made. The film stars Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker a brilliant thief who's team pull off the perfect heist and get's away with one of the biggest stashes in film history. But after Charlie and his boys get away with the loot somethings goes terribly wrong and now Charlie and his gang are off to L.A. to settle the score. The Italian Job is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and never get bored of it, it's an enthralling and pulse-pounding heist film that will have doubling over with laughter at the same time keeping you on the edge of your seat. I very, very highly recommend this amazing heist film. I hope my review helps ~ C.R. Lopez.",10,3,4,22 January 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Not as good and ending as it could have been, but good none the less
","Let me start off by saying I was disappointed in this film and overjoyed at the same time, why was overjoyed? Well because the Matrix: Revolutions answers allot of questions left in the second film. why was I disappointed? Well this film was a let down on a major scale it didn't feel like an ending to a great series it felt more like the season finale to a T.V. series, we'd see more of it next season and that didn't feel right to me, If they had given you more than just saying, ' Here you go! A half baked finale With a WTF ending and nothing to explain what happened afterward's.' That's what I felt The Wachowski brother's were saying to us loyal Matrix fans. They left us nothing in the end but the Matrix Revolutions. The half baked, exceedingly brilliant but ultimately flawed finale to The Matrix series.Was this a terrible movie? No, was it a great finale? Some would say so but I'd have to say it borders but this movie is not a bad ending to one of cinema's most complex and intriguing film series. But it leaves nothing to the imagination by this installment we've seen it all all the wire fu , all the philosophical meanings and all the preachy telling's of the war's end and Zion's victory. But is it that that makes this movie an alright finale Instead of an amazing one? Yes. Because Matrix fans have seen it twice already, by this time it's nothing new or anything cool anymore it's just the same stuff done over again. But don't get me wrong I didn't hate this movie I really liked it I'm just disappointed there wasn't more. Disappointed that they ended it without no further explanation of Zion of the machines of NEO. It just left you hanging in the wind. The Wachowski brothers did gives us one wild and fun filled ride along the the way with the first two films and I think if you agree with me this one does the same as the first two. But again what it lacks is the eye popping grandeur and mythological sense the first two films, the first in particular, had it gives you a great sense of justice and moral strength but it falls short on the passion it had instead it's lack luster attempt is very cool and stylish but nothing to go ga-ga over.Keanu Reeves( who did well here.) pulls an ace out of his sleeve and again makes this third installment, much like the second, bearable to watch. Hugo Weaving does great with his lines and serves up a good third round as Smith, Fishburne does much better than he did in the second, not by much, but better none the less. Carrie-Anne Moss looks tired and unattractive in this time around(as she did in the second.) she also is again the downside in this third installment, just like the second, she drags along so badly that it's not even funny to watch her talk. Monica Bellucci is a major high point tin this film, as she was in the second she gives it it's worth and a little more strength. Although not in the film much her time on screen is very enchanting. But all in all the cast, most of them, made this film a pretty good third installment.The things you got in the first two movies are not all present in the Matrix: Revolutions. The theme is very much the same, that's in this one. The story is very consistent and connects well with the first two. It doesn't have the same energy that the first two did. But what it does have is great popcorn entertainment style and class. It doesn't quite soar above that but it does come pretty close so is The Matrix: Revolutions a terrible film? No, it's it great fun to watch over and over again? Heck Yeah!! This film is not bad entertainment, it's not great entertainment, but it's not bad. Id' have to call it good entertainment it's a film you can come out of and say, 'Hey that wasn't half bad.' So I'd say it's worth the look and the time. But it's nothing special.All in all Revolutions falls short of the The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded but it does soar above the average film and there is where the secret of it's success lies. This film will give you a great time, nothing mind blowing but a great time none the less. All in all The Matrix: Revolutions is not half bad.",6,1,2,29 September 2009
Pitch Black," Not as good as it could have been, but a very good movie at that
","When I first saw 'Pitch Black' about seven years ago I didn't know what to think of it, I thought it was a very good Sci-Fi horror flick and that was pretty much it, But now seeing it again I has a whole new meaning. Pitch Black is the first movie in the chronicles of Riddick series and it introduces the world to Riddick.This film is not perfect, nor does it pretend to be, there's allot of bad dialog and sometimes the movie just seems to trail off in some places and doesn't follow a steady pace. But if you can over look that this Vin Diesel vehicle is pretty good.Pitch Black offers you a new insight to the creature feature genre. Instead of dinosaurs , croc's and giant bugs it gives you a whole new species to fear and loath, with that this film delivers only good creature violence and some awesome CGI but besides that it's not much more that a loud clunking action film nothing more nothing less. But all in all Pitch Black is an enjoyable, if not at times absurd, action film.",7,5,5,28 May 2009
Knowing," Knowing is everything, and this film knows!!
","What do we really know about the end of the world? Is there a pattern to predicting the future? These are the question's that this Alex Proyas directed Sci-Fi disaster film asks, it asks whether or not we believe in destiny or fate( which ever you believe in.) is real or not, weather it is just fiction or something more. Personally I believe in both, and this film explores both of those strange and bizarre occurrences . Nicholas Cage stars as professor Johnathan ' John' Koestler a man who's son amazingly stumbles upon a strange list of number's listing all the global disaster's for the last fifty years.Now he set's out to try and stop these last few event's from happening, but can one man really out run his fate? or the end of the world for that matter. Knowing presses a question that we all know, how will the world end? Well knowing takes it one step further and try to map out how will happen in it's own terms. This film puts a not so arch typical hero against the force of nature and puts our most frequently asked and most pondered question on the silver screen. Knowing how the world end is something we could never understand, this film brings it full center and opens us up to a world we've never know or seen before. Knowing is a definitely going to the Oscar's for visual effects and it's music and is surely going to please and shock audience's for all time.",9,6,13,14 April 2009
Collateral," One of the best crime thriller's ever
","Action films I'm always hesitant to see due to the fact that they can't balance out the story and the big sweeping action sequences in it.(Transformers and it's sequel comes to mind.) But now I've finally found another film, besides Die Hard, that perfectly balances story, action, and character development to the point of absolute perfection.I first heard of Collateral when it was recommended to me by a friend, seeing as none of my friends have good taste in films I wanted to pass it up. Well I'm now happy to say I'm glad I didn't. It was everything that action films today should be: taunt, suspenseful, extraordinarily smart, well thought out. Need I continue? Michael Mann(Who is the man! no pun intended. ) Crafts an ingenious little machine that creeps along at first very slow and then kicks it into full gear to blow your minds out in the end. It's bold and refreshing and is something amazing to watch unfold on screen as the cat and dog fight between Cruise and Foxx heats up. But none the less this is a brilliant film that is an amazing visual treat for the eyes and the senses.Tom Cruise(who gives another staggering and mind blowing performance.) plays a hit man like you've never seen before, he plays one with a conscience it is something truly amazing and breath taking to watch the way his character works on screen the ruthless way he kills without a seconds hesitation and then out of nowhere show's emotion for one of his kills, it's amazing and something to admire. Jamie Foxx(Who also delivers a fantastic performance here.) plays the cabby who has to drive around Cruise's character while he systematically whacks people. Foxx's performance is crucial and is in many ways, a contrast to Cruise's character and the way they almost become friends in a weird way is another fascinating thing to watch play out on screen. But all in all the two main leads and the rest of the cast hold up sturdy and strong in this brilliant film.Collateral is very complex in the way it portrays the relationship of the two main character's is played out so beautifully. The whole film is beautiful it's an amazing and monumental achievement in film making and is one of Cruise's and Foxx's best films to date. It's great fun to watch and see unfold in front of you and is shocking and heart breaking at the same time. All in all this is one hit you want to be in on.",10,1,1,24 October 2009
District 9," Amazing!! One of the years best films!
","I've seen Sci-Fi films that try and fail miserable to get that emotional reaction from audience by telling a recycled story and a dried up plot. But I'm finally happy to report that there is such a Si-Fi film, and this film is called 'District 9.' District 9 tells the story of a lone man, who is infected by an alien biotechnology and him and him alone becomes the only hope for the salvation of the aliens. It's a powerful film that resonates with Science Fiction classics of the 50's, 60's, 70's and early to mid 80's. It's an extraordinary example of human and alien courage and the cruelty that can bestowed on both(figuratively speaking.) I haven't seen a movie in a long, long time that has had a really deep lasting and thought provoking effect on me quite like the one this film gave me, I was left speechless by the dark and foreboding sense of justice and the heart that this film put into one mans struggle to free an oppressed race. It was staggering. This is a film that will not only go down in history as one of the best of the best in Sci-Fi, but it will also be remembered for it's heroics it's deep emotional connection you form between the characters, it's one of the best films of the year and is top dog in my book.The cast is mostly unknowns but for the most part they do an absolutely fantastic job.District 9 was a film when I first heard of it I wasn't too crazy to see it because of the documentary style of filming they showed in the trailer. But after finally seeing it I'm glad to say that it wasn't like hat at all.(well not completely.) The style and the feel of this film will capture you from the very first moment and won't let you go. It holds you in it's ingeniously woven and well thought out story web and the only way out is when the credits roll. But none the less District 9 is a film you will not forget until the day you die, it's a film not quite like anything you've ever seen or will ever see again, it's an ingenious little sleeper with a great heart and amazing emotional depth and character, it's technically brilliant and fantastically entertaining. All in all it delivers.",10,1,7,24 October 2009
Mamma Mia!," One of the best musicals around!
","Amazing!! Mamma Mia is the first genuinely funny and most lavishing musical I've seen yet. Mamma Mia stars Amanda Seyfried as Sophie a girl on the verge of getting married in two days, there's just one catch. She wants her father to give her away except she doesn't know who her father is, know it's a musical mystery to which of the three men she invited to the villa is her father, could it be Sam Carmichael the architect, Bill the free spirit, or Harry the quiet business man. Which one could it be? That's an answer for you to find out in this amazingly beautiful musical that boast some of the best ABBA song around and some other great music too. Mamma Mai is a treat for the whole family, it's one of those movies you can enjoy watching again and again.I very highly recommended this great film.",Null,2,6,23 January 2009
Twilight," It had good qualities, but bad acting and terrible scripting held it back from being better than what it is...
","While Twilight has an amazing premise and a great story to back it up, it can't help but fall prey to the terrible script and bad acting from the leads. Stephine Meyers' Twilight has a morbid energy level that resonates with a tale of forbidden love, and the story is highly interesting but it is extremely let down by a bad script, under direction and bad acting from the entire cast. What could have been an amazing Gothic, fantasy romance instead turns out to be nothing more than another teeny bopper romance film.Twilight is dark, complex and at sometimes it has it's moment where it really dazzles and amazes. But it falls short on an illogical script, unbelievable events and a story at times that defies all reason. But for the most part Twilight is an interesting film that does manage, in some strange way, to hold your attention for the first two acts of the film but it losses it momentum and strength in the third act and turns into a bad chase thriller. But all in all Twilight is a good idea and story muddled by everything imaginable in a film, but still is quite enjoyable even if it is preposterous and illogical.Kristen Stewart for the first act of the film(Before the entrance of Edward.) delivers a good performances, the second act she kind of starts to lag a little and in the third act her acting abilities are completely gone and she acts like an escape mental patient. Robert Pattinson is terrible in this film from his introduction to the end, he can't hold up the dramatic part he is assigned and really brings down the film causing Stewart to really try hard to keep it afloat , but sadly Pattinson brings Stewart down with him and the film fails to please except for it's dark style and the source material. But none the less the cast tries but fails to elevate this film above average and is just an average teen romance.Twilight is stylish and fresh but it wears out it's welcome by the third act and it becomes quite irritating and contrived. But all in all it's just another example of a good story and idea gone bad. Twilight is passing entertainment.",5,0,2,8 December 2009
Saving Private Ryan," One of the best WWII thrillers ever made!
","Truly amazing!! Saving Private Ryan is one of those rarities, it's a war film with heart. This amazing WWII film stars Tom Hanks as Capt. John Miller a solider who's seen too much and who is done with war, during D-Day him and his unit are ordered to find a single solider by the name of John Francis Ryan a private in the airborne division who just recently lost all three of his brothers in combat, now Miller and his men have to bring Ryan back alive while out running the Nazis and there conscious. Saving Private Ryan is a dedication to the men who died to protect there nation and there freedom they were soldiers who battled against oppression and evil. they fought for what they believed was right and conquered and this film shows that one man is just as important as the rest. I very highly recommend this astounding Motion picture. I hope my review helps ~ C.R. Lopez.",10,1,2,22 January 2009
Schindler's List," One of Spielberg's greatest film!
","Schindler's list is perhaps the best and most heartbreaking depiction of the Holocaust ever, It's a dark and heart breaking tale of one man's journey to become a hero to the Jew's of today, Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler a greedy factory owner who hires Jew's to minimum wage work for him. Soon enough he has all the money in the world and is happy as can be. Or so it appears, as the film progress you see the demeanor and attitude of Schindler change dramatically when he watches the Jewish people get slaughtered like animals by the Nazi's, after that he sets his heart on the sole task if getting them out of the camps and into his country. Schindler's List is the proved example of human kindness and compassion, It's a movie that will make your heart break and make the spirit soar at his heroic feet. Schindler's List is one of the greatest films ever made and will continue to shock and amaze people for all time. I very highly recommend this movie!",10,9,13,28 January 2009
Moulin Rouge!," Unmissable
","What beauty, what style, what grander Moulin Rouge is all that and more. Moulin Rouge is a beautiful and extremely intriguing film that is lush and lavish, Moulin Rouge's story is told by a love struck writer who while living in Paris trying to find the inspiration for his book, finds it in the strikingly beautiful Satine, a burlesque dancer at The Moulin Rouge.Moulin Rouge is a spectacular film that just rolls off the screen and sweeps you into another world of mystery and magic, Baz Lurhmann directs and writes for this sweeping musical/comedy that just to good to over look. This film has no low points but allot of high points, this film has amazing visual effects and amazing musical numbers( some of which you might know.) This movie also has many well know actors in it that all contribute to the films atmosphere and style, all the actors and actresses do an exceptional job in there parts, they make the roles feel so real and make there characters look and feel special in there own way. Tish movie isn't just another, it's a magical trip that you won't want to miss no matter what. All aboard the next stop, The Moulin Rouge.",8,1,2,19 April 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," More stylish than the first but more pitiful and terribly acted and plotted than the first..
","While New Moon boasts new locals, better acting and some over stylized action sequences it can't in noway measure up to the the minor success that Twilight had. It's style too earnest, it's story to contrived and boring and while the acting is much better than what was given in Twilight can't really save this film from being nothing but another entry in one of the most undeserving popular film adaption of Stephine Meyers' worldwide sensation books, making it a boring and under-made teeny bopper romantic adventure. Is New Moon good entertainment? Sorry to say, but no. Is it unbearable awful? Nowhere near it but it does come close in some scenes.New Moon is dull, dimwitted, over-stylized, under-directed, under-plotted and basically suffers from every problem imaginable and can't even surpass the first film but does give you a good look at what a strained relationship looks like. But besides that it can't seem to keep it's head afloat long enough to entertain or even convince us of what is going on in the story. But I will give it credit to it's new director Chris Weitz(Director of the atheist film, The Golden Compass.) He does well in elevating the acting and adding action sequences to the film to make it more appealing. But even the action is flat and lifeless and just adds to the nothingness this film already is. But all in all New Moon is nothing new at all and is just a failure that got lucky.Kristen Stewart does elevate her performance here for the most part but she falls short when the dramatic scenes come up and helps make this film extremely unbelievable and unconvincing. Robert Pattinson impressed me with bring his performance from bad to alright, and boy was he bad in the first film. But Pattinson up his performances and just when you think he's going to keep climbing but instead he falls right back down the ladder to the bottom again. Taylor Launter is nothing new or anything good in this film but I will give him credit for trying his hardest with the soapy dialogue and the dumb down plot. But even he can't save the film seeing as he is one of the reasons it fails with his bland and emotionless performance. But all in all the cast falls and when they do you can hear it a hundred miles away.Twilight Saga: New Moon is not what you expect or even want, it's a mess of a film that suffers heavily from it's poor script and under direction. It's nothing more than a crowd pleaser if you can call it that it's nothing new and certainly nothing special and it's a film I regret wasting m time on. All in all New Moon is an A-Bomb times a hundred.",1,7,10,8 December 2009
The Illusionist," A brilliant film, One of Ed Norton's best!
","There's one word that can describe this film, pure genius! this amazing period piece mystery stars Edward Norton as Eisenheim a traveling Illusionist who while doing a show in Vienna meets up with an old childhood sweetheart Sophie, she is know the fiancée of the crowned prince Leopold. The illusionist is a lavish film that is bathed in dark tones, and amazing cinematography. This film is much different them the Prestige a movie that came out in the exact same year, the Prestige deals with the three rules of a magician. While the illusionist doesn't it deals with mystery ,murder & deception. And it blends perfectly into such a way that this film will leave you absolutely stumped until the very end ( and I mean the very end!) Edward Norton turns in an Oscar worthy performance as a mysterious traveling magician, and Paul Giamatti(also exceptional) proves he's just as good as the rest. This movie is one that you can enjoy over and over again, and no mater how many times you see it you still be in awe of the vast beauty of it all.",8,1,1,6 February 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Posssible the greatest film in a decade!
","The curious case of Benjamin Button is a truly amazing dedication to life and how you should live it. David Fincher's amazing drama tells the story of a man named Benjamin Button, Benjamin isn't like other kids his age. In fact he's like nothing the world has ever seen before, He was a man born old, and as time went by Benjamin started to get younger and younger while the people around him get older and die. The curious case of Benjamin Button is a celebration about the meaning of living life to it's fullest. It's an inspiration to all people young and old that just because your getting older doesn't mean you can't live life like there's no tomorrow. I very,very highly recommended this truly exceptional film.",10,1,3,28 December 2008
Children of Men," Mindblowing film!! One of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made!!
","I was wandering in a DVD shop one day just looking for something to buy, anything that looked interesting and I came across Children of Men, at first I wasn't really interested in it so I went on to look for something else, but amazingly something compelled me to buy this movie. And I did, and now I'm glad I did Children of Men does what most dystpoia sci-fi adventures rarely do, they tell a story that all of us can relate to in someway or another. Children of Men stars Clive Owen as Theo Faron a disillusioned bureaucrat who has been tasked with the sole duty of escorting and protecting the first pregnant woman in 18 years to the Human Projects so they can utilize her pregnancy to fix the fertility problem with the world. It's a heart pounding & mind blowing visual race to get out of England before the government catches them and use the poor girls baby for publicity and to acquire money to fiancé there war with the rebels. Children of Men is a heart wrenching film that deserves to be called one of the greatest modern Science Fiction films ever made. I very highly recommend this amazing film.",10,2,11,9 April 2009
The Last Samurai," An amazingly beautifully crafted and executed Epic film
","When I first saw this movie I didn't like the concept, I didn't like the idea of an American solider turning on his kind to fight with the enemy. Boy was I in mature! Now seeing it again now more mature and more knowledgeable of history this film has allot of meaning to me. It's epic, sprawling, beautiful, intelligent, brutal, honorable and most of all heart breaking.The Last Samurai chronicles the story of a beaten and battered Civli War hero who's seen one too many innocent lives and people killed during his service in the war. Now in 1870's he accepts an offer to train Japans modern army to battle the samurai's, but soon in some strange twist of fate he finds himself learning form his enemy. It's an intense and heart breaking piece of film making that is of the highest caliber, it's a great and powerful film that tells a story of honor and respect and the way of the samurai. It's grand and spectacular and it gives so much of it's self and of it's story the power that it releases is in small capsules that slowly but surely open one at a time releasing strong and bracing scenes from each of them.Tom Cruise deliverer's one of his finest performances of his career as the battered Civil War hero. Tony Goldwyn is fantastic in the scenes he's in he gives a very good an very convincing antagonistic performance. Billy Connolly(in his small role) does good as always and puts on a very commanding show as the good sergeant. But it is Ken Watanabe who steals the show, his performance is absolutely fantastic and stunning as the leader of the Samurai, he pulls no stops to prove himself and take his game to the next level, he is utterly fantastic. All in all the cast does extraordinarily well in this handsomely mounted film.The Last Samurai is a blend of old traditions and honor mixed with American military strategies. This film put's up a very good fight and pulls no punches when it comes to story, characters, scenery it put's it's self in the middle of the fight as the Samurai did. It's a beautiful and grand film that needs to be cherished as much as it needs to be respected It's powerful in it's execution, beautiful in it's scenery and production and a staggering piece of film making at it's finest Edward Zwick tops all his previous films and creates a great and magnificent portrayal of what true honor is. All in all The Last Samurai delivers a truly great movie going that will not be forgotten.",10,12,26,11 October 2009
Inside Man," An amazingly unpredictable crime thriller
","Inside Man is a completely original and engrossing Heist film filled with tension and an air of mystery that won't let up to the very end. Inside Man stars Clive Owen as Dalton Russell, an elusive and brilliant criminal mastermind who amazingly plans and executes the perfect bank robbery. Now Russell has over 50 people held hostage in a bank and won't let them out until he proves he is the best there is. Denzel Washington stars as the cop Keith Frazer who is assigned to negotiate the release of Russell's hostages. As the hours tick on by and the situation becomes more tense Frazer and the police are starting to wonder what Russell is really after. Inside Man is one of the best heist thrillers ever made, it has style, perfect planning and intricate detailing into the mind of a brilliant criminal and bank robbing. it's an intense and well thought out film by Spike Lee(probably one of his best.) the film shows you what would happen if a man pulled off the perfect crime and got away with it, It also is trying to get across what it is like to be in a situation like this and what would the police would do if it escalated to the point that they would have to go in guns blazing. How would they get the hostages out safely? How would they stop the bank robbers from killing them all? And the most important one, can they stop him? This film is truly a treat for the eyes and the senses, it's a masterpiece of unparalleled proportion that can't be missed no matter what the cost. Inside man is the perfect steal. unpredictable",9,0,1,31 March 2009
The Da Vinci Code," Amazing adaption of an equally amazing novel
","When the book was released in 2003 following the huge success of Dan Brown's other novel Angels & Demons. No one not even Dan Brown himself could have Imagined what a huge global phenomenon The DaVinci Code would be, the book has been translated into almost every language it's old out millions of copies all over the world, and I happen to have a copy at that. SO when I heard they were making one of the greatest books in modern history into a film to tell you the truth I wasn't real all that optimistic, so when I went to go see the DaVinci Code in theaters during it's opening weekend I was floored and utterly stunned by how amazing and accurate this film was to the book, albeit they changed some things but that's the film industry for you. Now seeing it again after four years and it's still amazing.Tom Hanks turns in an amazing performance as Robert Langdon who will soon be considered one of the greatest literature characters of all time, Langdon is something of an enigma, he follows no code or by no means any standards and he always puts everything of himself to save lives at no cost to his own. Tom Hanks brings to life a character that people have come to love and admire. And he's done it with his own style and grace, Langdon isn't just some character on a page anymore no he;s been brought to life in an exceptional way the only the likes of Ron Howard and Hanks could.The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown was a global literary phenomenon but now it's also a global film phenomenon as well. I know allot of of fans put down this movie due to some minor changes that were made but if you look past that this movie will not disappoint.Unlike most books brought to the silver screen, this one is faithful and very thought out. It's not some half baked movie like Kiss the girls or it's sequel.No the DaVinci Code was made to be exactly like the book as much as possible and they did very well in my opinion, this movie is not prefect and it doesn't pretend to be, this movie is well thought out and made but at some parts it falls a little short of overwhelming. But if you see the bright side to this film and if you look at it for the great movie that it is, you definitely won't be disappointed. All in all The DaVinci Code delivers great any day entertainment.",10,4,8,6 June 2009
Titanic," The most amazing film I've had the pleasure of seeing!!
","some movies don't live up to their hype, some don't even live up to be movies. But this; this one does that and so much more. James Cameron's Titanic tells the story of Jack Dawson a poor and down on his luck painter who scores tickets for passage on the 'Unsinkable' Titanic, there he meets Rose Dewitt Bukator. Rose is traveling to Philadelphia to marry her rich snob of a fiancée Caledon 'Cal' Hockley, and on the way the two become fast friends and soon fall in love. For those of you who have heard the story or haven't heard of it at all this is the movie to watch. All be it it's not a hundred percent accurate but it does well with telling the tragic story of the titanic. The Titanic is a monumental achievement of film making at it's best and also one of the highest grossing film's of all time, It's a beautiful film with great heart and soul; you feel every emotion that's in the film love, joy, angry, sorrow ,fear and anguish. Titanic is a romantic film that no other in the genre can follow or surpass, it's an amazing love story and tear jerker all rolled up into one. James Cameron creates a beautiful and breathtaking scenery and magnificent special effects in a film to end all film's. Titanic is one of the greatest film's ever made and will continue to inspire people to believe in fate, and in love.",10,0,2,6 April 2009
The Happening," An amazing example of why not to abuse nature.
","The Happening is the most original, and most entertaining and pleasing apocalyptic thriller I've ever seen. This amazing film stars Mark Whalberg and Zooey Deschanel as Elliot and Alma Moore a couple who in the midst of there marital problems hear about strange occurrences that have been happening in New York city, people out of nowhere start killing themselves left and right and with no reason or explanation. Soon enough it hits everywhere in the northwestern area, entire groups of people are turning into suicidal maniacs and nobody know why. As Elliot and Alma are trying to out run this mysterious plague, they start to realize that this might not be what everyone believes it is, it might actually be something no one on this planet is meant to understand, something that cannot be explained by normal means, something that must be witnessed to believe, there's an event occurring. And it's happening right now in this film. The Happening blends Shyamalan's unique style of film making with eyeball freezing horror that you just have to see to believe. I very highly recommended this amazing film.",5,2,4,21 January 2009
The Matrix Reloaded," Amazing!! Almost as good as the first
","This movie is an adequate sequel, it doesn't quite live up to the original(what sequels do?) what it does is give you a ground-breaking exercise in mind bending, out of this world adventure and special effects. It's a layered and very well made Sci-Fi epic that can very well be a good sequel but saying it surpasses the earth smattering, ground breaking original is a little out of this world. Oh wait! That's exactly what these films are.The Matrix: Reloaded is exceptional well crafted and blended Science fiction adventure it brings more to the table this time than the first one and with a bigger and more grand style it serves up course after course of mind bending twists, out of this world action and more ground breaking special effects than the first film. This movie is not as philosophical as which is something that made the first so enjoyable ad good, instead Reloaded somewhat discards of the preachy moments of the first film and focuses more on the action and the thrills, which is good and all but that sometimes does not make a movie. No what made this series great was it's dark under tones and malicious story between deceit and truth and the line that sometimes that can get blurred along the way. But is Reloaded a bad movie? No way! Is it a good sequel to the The Matrix? Most definitely. Doe sit live up to the first? Heck yeah!! SO what is it that makes a great movie? Well if you've seen The Matrix and The Matrix: Reloaded than you've seen great film making on a rare and near-grand scale. It bust off the screen in an almost three dimensional style that can't be match or copied for that matter, The Matrix: Reloaded blew all the competition away at the 2003 box office and set a new standard for movie sequel excellence and the way it should be done. It's powerful and brilliant and an ingenious machine that ticks along, slowly counting down the minutes to the end. But honestly if your watching this film will you even care about time? Or anything around you for that matter? No you'll be too caught up in the extravagance and mind boggling splendor of this movie.Keanu Reeves turns in an adequate performance in this sequel to his super star making role in the first film. He brings more to the table than the first time around and makes the movie oh so much more better than if he wasn't in it. Carrie-Anne Moss was the only let down in this film in the first she was fantastic in this she was dragging herself just trying to keep up with Reeves and Fishburne, Fishburne was also a little stale in this film he doesn't give off the same fascination and vibe that made it so great in the first. But none the less Fishburne holds his own and comes out on top, Hugo Weaving(who I know have great respect for) keeps the same power and intensity that he had in the first film and he raises the bar in this one and goes all in with all two billion of him bring the fight to NEO's doorstep.It's a wild and insanely fun ride that can't be missed or ignored, it's great fun for anyone with a heart for complex stories and mind bending plot twist. This film delivers more and more each time you watch it and each time you feel differently. It's a great film with a great vibe with amazing eye opening special effects. Its great for anyone in the mood for a good time then look no further than the Matrix: Reloaded it'd your guide to wild, insane and out of this world fun. The Matrix Reloaded delivers.",8,1,2,28 September 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A terrible follow up to the adequate 2007 film
","This 2009 follow up to the Massive smash, minor critical hit is nothing short of dull, overly plotted, over crowed and most of all dumb. It tries to live up to the minor smarts the first film had, but it fails miserably because of it's over use of CGI and it's bad script and semi-interesting story. It fails to live up to the Transformers name or even the first film at that. All in all this film is a waste of 200 million dollar.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is nothing short of a good idea gone bad, Michael Bay tries and fails to bring up the value of the sequel to his adequate adaption of the popular kids show and toy line. But there are three main reasons that it failed. 1.) It's dull, overlong and it doesn't follow any strict set of rules or even a coherent plot for that matter. 2.) It's terrible and bland acting on most part of the cast brings down the high production values of this film. But to no avail they don't succeed very well. 3.) It's just a plain, old good car with bad parts. All in all this film could have been so much better.Shia LaBeouf(Who was alright in the first but bad here.) Tries his best with the bad script and terrible direction on the part of Michael Bay. But he fails to bring any convincing emotion or even good jokes to his character. Megan Fox(who is amazing to look at.) is bad, her bland and inside the box performance is hard to watch sometimes you just want to look at her instead of hear her talk. John Turturro( A saving grace in this film.) Brings the good jokes and the good acting to this film and really makes it one reason to see it just for his time on screen. Josh Duhamel( Another ray of hope.) Does well in this and shows his stuff and makes this film easy to sit trough. But all in all the cast(most of them.) Does alright with there assigned parts and makes this a bad film instead of horrible.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is dumb fun, it uses flashy and stylish CGI rock'em sock'em robot fights, an alluring female lead and bad jokes to entertain. But it fails miserable in it's attempt to be good and plausible entertainment. It drags along for way too long and is very boring at times. But on the bright side it is great fun and a good thrill ride to enjoy. But nothing more. All in all it was a shallow attempt at making a franchise that has been around for more than 30 years and turns it into a bad film. All in all Revenge of the Fallen is an A-Bomb.",1,2,9,18 October 2009
Shooter," An amazing action dazzler

Mark Whalberg stars as Bob Lee Swagger, a retired Marine sniper who after losing his best friend and spotter disappears from site, to live out his days alone in seclusion. ten years later he is approached by Colonel Issac Johnson who asks him to use his knowledge to stop an assassination attempt on the president. And that's where the story explodes into a take no prisoners thriller that will have your pulse racing. and your adrenaline pumping hard all the way to end. I very highly recommend this movie.

Vanilla Sky," Amazing film!! One of the bets mind bender's since The Matrix
","This movie was allot of things to me. It was strangely beautiful, oddly touching. Complex, brilliant, stunning , grand, outrageously entertaining; need I go on? Vanilla Sky was a movie at first I didn't think I would like but after awhile I saw that there was more too it than meet's the eye. It was a very touching movie in an odd sense it shows you the trails and tribulations of a man trying to grasp whether or not his world is real or a dream.There are things in life we don't quite understand and there are things we do, this film explores the latter it explores the perception that our world does sometimes seem like a dream and that things we do and things we don't can effect the realm of our imagination and the realm of our life. This movie doves deep into the physic of the human mind and it plucks at every sense and every feeling to provoke the main stimulus of our mind and it does it so well with such style and artistic beauty, It's a quintessential movie that mus be seen with an open mind and heart to fully comprehend the complex nature of it's story and it's deeper underlined meaning that is unearthed as the story moves along. It's astoundingly well made and crafted and is something that is going to become a classic as time goes on.Tom Cruise(who was utterly fantastic here.) delivers one of his most potent and brilliant performances as wealthy playboy David Aames, Jr. an successful publisher who finds his whole life turned upside down. Kurt Russell does as just a good job as Cruise in his forceful performance as the compassionate psychiatrist who becomes a father figure to Cruise and brings Cruise's character out of his dark place. It's a great father son type of relationship to see unfold on screen. Penelope Cruz does amazing here she's so graceful and beautiful and is something amazing to watch on screen, she's fantastic! But the real weak point in this film was Cameron Diaz, her performance was so annoying and bland that when she died you showed no pity what so ever. But besides that the rest of the cast holds up very nicely and does a fantastic job.This movie is a mind bending, melting pot of a film it's meant to bring out the most elated feeling of power and sorrow from the deepest part's of your mind. It's a film you can't miss at all it's amazing, breath taking, dark and so entertaining to watch. Vanilla Sky is a shoot out the lights , blow your hair back, mind blowing experience you have just got to see. All in all Vanilla Sky is a wild trip you'll want to take.",10,0,2,7 October 2009

Identity," An amazing psychological mind trip!!
","Identity is an amazingly well made and well acted slasher mystery thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat form the opening credits. It's a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable movie.Identity stars John Cusack, Ray Liotta & Amanda Peet as three of the ten strangers trapped in a run down motel during a savage thunder storm.

Speed," The best of the best!!
","Speed is something we all love, I know I sure do, the feel of the car going fifty miles an hour you passing everyone by like they were turtles. People cursing you out and flicking you off as you swerve in and out of traffic like a mad man. But wait! There's a problem, your not driving some supped up sports car. Your driving a LosAngeles city bus that is rigged to blow if it drops below 50 M.P.H. then bus goes kaboom!! And you and everybody else inside are toast(or more like smoked meat, but you get the idea.) This is the problem L.A.P.D. detective Jack Traven has. He has to keep a bus full of people alive while trying not to drop below fifty,talk about a major adrenaline rush.Speed is nicknamed 'Die Hard ob a bus', and to tell you the truth it is, Speed is an electrifying mix of adrenaline pushing action and heart stopping stunts, it's the kind of movie you walk into and know your just going to love it( how can't you?) this film is not meant to be Die Hard it's meant to be a film that rivals Die Hard, and right now it is still the only film that can rival it.Speed is not your ordinary action film it's one of the few with smarts, and plenty of it to go around this film throws out the smarts and action in perfect harmony, not many action films do that, and that is what makes this one so unique and original and so much fun to watch, Speed is the best action film when it comes to humor, intelligence's and most importantly Speed. It's a film you can watch over and over again and love every minute of it it truly is the top dog of action.",10,2,4,19 April 2009
X2: X-Men United," One of the greatest comic book adaptions ever made!!
","X2: X-Men United now how can you sum up this amazing sequel to 2000 X-Men, not in 300 words I'm sorry to say. X2 is one of the best comic book sequels ever made and still number one on my list as the greatest comic book ever made. X2 has the entire cast who made up X-men back and doing what they do best, giving you one heck of a wild ride. X2 picks up right where X-men left off, with Magneto in jail and the world feeling a little more threatened by the mutants of Charles Xavier, William Stryker a high ranking military official gain permission form the president to exterminate all mutants. Now it's a race against time for Logan and the Reaming X-Men to stop Styrker before he destroys all mutants'. X2: X-Men United is an amazing treat for the eyes and the sense's, it's a visual stunning and magnificent movies that people of any age can love. X2 introduce a new member of the X-men, night crawler(He was an original member in the comics) he plays a very pivotal role in this movie as do all the X-men, they all share traits from there comic book counterparts and that's what makes this film so enjoyable. All the actors bring a special style and pizazz to old friends and make them seem so new and exciting. If you enjoyed X-Men then X2: X-men United is the movie for you.",10,0,0,5 April 2009
The Matrix," The best Sci-Fi thriller ever made! Hands down.
","When I first saw this movie when I was twelve I didn't think much of it, I thought it had a confusing story and a mindless plot that was supported and only succeeded by out of this world slow motion stunts. Boy was I naive or what!? Now seeing it again after all these years I could see that I was not ready back then to handle a movie of this complexity and strange coherent means of story telling. But now I fully respect and love this movie for what it is and for what it always will be, mindbogglingly, mind blowing, out of this world fun.When the Matrix was released in 1999 this was the film to go see people were busting out of the theater's and telling anyone they can to go see this movie. It was the 'It' movie of the year and it gained the title justly. This film mapped out new territory in action and ushered in a whole new generation of action & Sci-Fi thrillers and video games as well(Max Payne comes to mind) it is one of the biggest and most beloved film of the 90's and has one of the biggest fan base out there.This movie unique and I mean unique story and style has such and impact on you when you first see it you'll want to see it the minute it's over and some more after that and after that and you'll want to see it a million times it's just that good. The Matrix put's a Gothic and dark spin on the dystopia and apocalyptic themes that have become very common in Sci-Fi films, this film does it one better it takes those overly used themes and creates a completely original and unique world around which everything we Believe is a lie. It has a great monolithic tone to it that makes it a masterpiece by any standards and it creates a great aftershock in which few films can actually do these days. It purposes that machines while enslave humanity and use us as a battery source to power there vasts armies of machines around the world. But that's what makes it so great to watch it gives you a sense of hope and a sense of justice that you just feel all the way to your bones.This movie has given the fellow movie goer what they've always wanted and always searched for in a film, great action, a smart story and plot, acting you can live with and put them all together and what do you got? The Matrix! This movie will stick with long after it's over and even after tour old you'll still remember one movie that rocked your world like none other. All in all this film delivers great any day entertainment that is like Laurence Fishburn said, ' Unfortunately no one can be told what the Matrix is you have to see it for yourself.' And trust me once you do you won't ever look at Sci-Fi or other movies the same way again. This movie delivers.",10,0,1,6 September 2009
Jurassic Park," One of Spielberg's best!
","You want great dinosaurs action, well you've got it! Jurassic Park is perhaps the best book to film ever made and one of the best creature features ever made, actually it is the best. Jurassic Park was a one of a kind film in ti's day it had amazing CGI and truly mind blowing automated prosthetic dinosaurs.Jurassic Park stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Wayne Knight and Samuel L. Jackson. as a group of people who are invited and who work on an island called Isla Nublar, no one knows what it is and for five years a man named John Hammond has been setting up a sort of biological preserve off the coast of Costa Rica, but this preserve is much different than any other it doesn't house animals it houses dinosaurs, a species of creatures not seen for over 5,000 years. now a group of scientist have the great opportunity to see these amazing creatures before anyone else, but in the blink of an eye this amazing experience turns into a swift rampaging nightmare that unleashes an awesome fury the likes the world has never seen before. Now theses scientist have to out run some of the most deadly predators the world has ever know. Jurassic Park is a high tech pulse racing, mind blowing and eyeball freezing adventure that won't let up till the very end. I very,very highly recommended this amazing film. I hope my thoughts helps~C.R. Lopez 2/4/2009",10,8,12,4 February 2009
