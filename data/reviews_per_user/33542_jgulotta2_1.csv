Skyfall," A epic fail
","If you have ever watched the classic Bonds then you will agree with my rating. If you have not then you don't know what a real Bond movie is and should watch them before you watch this. Story drops off somewhere in the movie and then is gone. Q really an emo Q, get outta here with that. Kill off M well another mistake. Daniel Craig is well...... Oh yea James Bond does not drink Heineken. License To Kill was the last great Bond, yes I know who played Bond, but this was the last of the true Bond style. Pierce did an OK job, but sometimes you just gotta stop a movie or series being made and give up being greedy Ms. Broccoli. Overall I will continue to enjoy my old Bond movies and plan to never watch anything produced with the motive of greed over quality in the James Bond films.",1,25,45,14 December 2012
