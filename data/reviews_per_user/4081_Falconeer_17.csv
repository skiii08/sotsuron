Blade Runner 2049," Worthy Sequel To A Film Masterwork
","This was a risky venture, making a film that is this slow and cerebral, in an age where social media and cellphone addiction has caused modern audiences to have the attention span (and IQ) of a flea. But 'Blade Runner 2049' defies the demands and tastes of modern, 'mouth breathing' audiences, by emerging as a sequel that retains both the mood, and pace of the original. Gosling, in the role of the young Blade Runner, 'K' doesn't quite have the charisma of Harrison Ford, but his cold, emotionless style of acting fits perfectly with the role he is playing. A detective, hunting down and 'retiring' older model Replicants, is a manufactured human himself, albeit a more modern and much improved model. But is he in fact, manufactured, or could it be that his childhood memories are authentic, and not just an implanted chip in his brain? And what connection does he have to Rick Deckard? This is the question, and main dilemma in this quiet and thought provoking film. And while not as flawless as the 1982 masterpiece, BR2049 is certainly the finest sequel to come out of Hollywood in two decades. Having the structure and pacing of a European film, it is so refreshing to finally see something of this caliber on the big screen again. That in itself is nostalgic; that feeling of being truly immersed in a movie at the theater, without being disappointed by inferior, rushed features that were so obviously just produced to generate a profit. It's interesting to note that. although this film is visually stunning, it still isn't as gorgeous as a film that came out 37 years earlier. But so many scenes in this sequel are unforgettable, and iconic. The 'return of Rachael' cameo was stunning and absolutely chilling, especially seeing the way they so coldly dispatch her when her image doesn't fulfill it's purpose. Of course without a solid script, this could have been little more than a series of pretty images. Thankfully, the story line is captivating from the very beginning. The mystery surrounding Joe's origins was well executed. in fact it was an emotional journey, as one can feel the character's pain caused by the desire to find his own worth and identity, a timeless subject that so many of us can relate to on some level. The final scene in the snow was filled with such desolation and loneliness, and i was not expecting to be so emotionally moved by a film like this. I cannot fathom the reviews that tear the movie apart and suggest that it is a bad film. I imagine those who hated this had no real understanding of the first film, or they are simply of the younger generation, who obviously possess no attention span whatsoever. BR 2049 is a film that Sci Fi fans will cherish, and want to add to their personal film libraries. It's bound to be a classic. It certainly won't be forgotten.",8,3,13,15 August 2019
Train to Busan," Forgettable, Generic Horror
","If you want to understand how far the quality of horror movies, and cinema in general, have disintegrated over the years, just watch one of these new-age, current movies, back to back with something like 'Return of the Living Dead,' (1985.) or 'The Beyond' (1981). The decline in quality of our entertainment is sad and astonishing. 'Road To Busang' is another modern zombie movie, utterly indiscernible from all the other current horror crap, with it's flat, cheap cinematography, fake looking CGI, and this desperate need these current zombie films seem to all have, in bringing emotional drama into a genre where it is laughably out of place and just ludicrous. Some exciting zombie chase scenes are present and the large cast is impressive, but we have seen it before, in movies like '28 Days Later.' Honestly, there is nothing new here, and the only outstanding quality is that little girl, who gives quite an impressive performance in this. On a side note, all the raves and compliments showered upon a cast member who played a cheerleader, made me curious to see what all the fuss was about. Imagine how shocked I was to see the 'Goddess' is actually some little girl with thin, stringy black hair that looks like a cheap wig for a witch costume, legs like toothpicks and the facial features of a down syndrome victim. Is this the current idea of beauty? Did anyone else wonder where her chin went? Maybe it got eaten by zombies. It seems like the beauty standards have gone down the sewer, along with popular taste in film and music. I find this a bit sad. 'Train To Busan' is one of those popcorn flicks that you watch once while texting on your phone...something that you forget 5 minutes after you see it. I refer to the majority of current films and music as 'throwaway entertainment.' Nobody is going to be talking about this movie 2 years from now...nobody will even remember it. I also doubt that anyone over the age of 18 that has more than 5 brain cells will think highly of this extended TV show.",5,3,6,19 October 2019
Rocky V," Rocky Redeemed
","After the embarrassing trash-fest that was 'Rocky IV,' which was a sledgehammer that destroyed a franchise known for having the perfect balance of action and drama, by morphing the characters into cartoons...we get a return to form. 'Rocky V' seems to be an apology for that veering off course, by bringing back the raw emotion that made the world love these iconic characters. Slammed for being 'depressing,' even though life can be depressing, and no matter how high a person climbs, they can always fall back into the sludge that they crawled out of. I'm guessing people didn't want to think about that, or anything, while watching something that must have looked like a throwback in 1990.
Returning to his Philly roots after losing his fortune, (by way of a far-fetched plot device but it's a MOVIE and it was necessary to tell the story it wanted to tell), Rocky and Adrian must rebuild their lives from zero. Having grown up in privileged wealth, Rocky's son, (played by Stallone's real-life son, Sage) doesn't adjust too well to life in a rough Philly slum. The kid needs to develop a thick skin when confronted by a jealous bully at school, and the fact that his dad is wrapped up in reliving his old dreams, by training the next big boxing champ, doesn't help his son cope. This is basically a father/son relationship story, and it wasn't what the 'Rocky IV' crowd wanted. But those who remember the original, were mostly happy to see a return to reality. And maybe the film makers were aware that more people could relate to hard times and poverty than mansions and Maserati's, but looking at some of the criticisms here, they overestimated the intelligence of Rocky fans. Seeing the 'old neighborhood' is such a nostalgia trip for those who grew up watching 'Rocky' and 'Rocky II' that any flaws can be forgiven. Seeing Mickey return in those emotionally charged dream sequences was another high point, as was seeing Sly acting with his real-life son, who was really good in the role. In the end, the message behind 'Rocky V' is a simple one, that family is more important than wealth and fame. The movie's final fight did not take place in some big boxing ring with lights and celebrities, but rather in a dirty Philadelphia street, with Rocky in a brutal, bare knuckles street brawl with his nemesis, Tommy 'Machine Gunn' Morrison, the up and comer that turned on him after being trained by the champ and then selling out to the sleazy world of professional boxing, which is exposed here in a very honest way. The fight is raw, and as hard as that brawl with Clubber Lang in the also excellent 'Rocky III,' only this time it takes place in the real world. Why so many people didn't like this movie is an absolute mystery to me.",8,1,2,24 July 2019
Hostel," Ridiculously under-appreciated film
","I waited 5 years to see this, but I'm glad I finally did. I can honestly say that most critiques of this film are inaccurate and unfair. 'Hostel' is an intense and extremely well-made modern horror film. Comments that 'the action' doesn't begin until after an hour, were obviously written by viewers with infantile attention spans, and video game addicts. The calm before the storm is known as tension building, or 'suspense.' 'Hostel' begins to get creepy almost immediately, before the guys even leave Amsterdam, when the Slovakian guy makes the comment about being able to do anything to the girls from this remote village. By the time Paxton and his traveling companions arrive in Slovakia, it is already obvious that what will follow will be something very bizarre and terrifying. Director Eli Roth has obviously learned a lot from, not only classic horror films, but also foreign film, as he takes the familiar direction of the slower, more suspenseful style of his Euro counterparts. Beautiful and strange little touches like the murderous children, and the ambiguous suggestions of one main characters sexuality also lend this one a definite Euro feel. Those that commented on the amount of nudity and sex in the film must have led very sheltered lives, never seeing a foreign film. The nudity is very brief, and only occurs at the beginning. The abandoned building where the torture/killings take place is truly brilliant in all it's dirty and bloody splendor, and the violence is realistic, shocking and disturbing. Anyone offended or sickened by said images should have done a bit of research before looking at the film, and known enough to steer clear of it. But no, they wanted to see it, just so they could rip it apart and call it 'sick.' These same people paid to see it; what does that make them? Hypocrites. 'Hostel' cleverly lulls the viewer into a false sense of security with an intentional light mood. The beginning portion of the film utilizes bright colors and upbeat music. The second portion sees the colors washing away, along with the light feeling. Halfway through 'Hostel' observant viewers will notice that the color is gone completely, leaving only shades of black, brown and gray, with the only real color being the red of the gallons of blood being spilled. The harshest critics should watch this one again only this time they might want to switch their brains on, and maybe they will see all the little nuances and symbolism that make 'Hostel' an intelligent, classic horror film. The thing that places 'Hostel' in a different league from similar films like 'Saw,' is the suggestion of evil on such a grand scale. While 'Saw' dealt with the anger and vengeance of one man, 'Hostel' suggests a world where an entire village might be in on the conspiracy of murdering innocents, and not even for some moral or spiritual reason; but rather these people are in it for nothing more than financial gain. 'Hostel' suggests an evil and an inherent corruption, an immorality on such a large scale, that the film can hardly fail at being one of the most evil and disturbing films of our time. As a horror film, therefore, 'Hostel' succeeds and surpasses all other imitators.",8,2,4,15 December 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Typical Disney mess
","The problem with Disney is that they try way too hard to sell the product, to rake in the big bucks, and it is quite obvious when one watches this 'epic.' While the cast is quite good and attractive, too much just did not work here. Why does Disney always have to include the standard 'talking animals doing the stand-up comedy bit?' The wolves looked good, genuinely scary, until the lead wolf started to talk. He sounded as menacing as Richard Simmons. I guess the guys at Disney were afraid that if they included any scary or intense moments at all, then the parents wouldn't shell out the bucks at the movie houses and then at the DVD store. Everything was so fanatically politically correct. No, the oldest boy could never stab the wolf that was about to eat his brother and sisters. The wolf literally jumped on the sword. I am not saying the film should have been filled with the same frightful images as the thousand times better LOTR. But this limp adaption of a classic children's book is just disappointing. Every commercial stunt was pulled here to ensure big numbers at the box office. I hate this kind of movie-making. And even more, i miss the days before computer imaging replaced real special effects, or real anything for that matter. Why build a magnificent kingdom, even if it is on miniature scale, when they can simply super-impose the image onto the screen? It must save the studios billions of dollars. The only problem is, it looks like crap. It was obvious that most of the landscape was simply not there. Personally if i want to look at this kind of thing, I would prefer simple animation, classic Saturday morning cartoons. I suppose after the cinematic milestone that was Lord Of the Rings, it will be quite difficult for anything to live up to that films grandeur. And perhaps computer imaging was used in LOTR, but it was done so much better. The landscapes, the cities, the million plus armies, actually looked real for the most part. I guess however, that kids will love 'Narnia.' Most kids are fairly easy to please. Look at all the junk on TV every Saturday morning! This one is a disappointment.",3,5,9,11 August 2006
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Braindead
","Another loud, brainless CGI summer flick to dull the senses. I realize that people want to shut off their brains during the summer holidays, but this is ridiculous. The fact that Jake Gyllenhal was cast as a 'Persion Prince' makes it obvious from the beginning, that this is nothing to be taken seriously. In fact, ALL the leads were white, in this very Arabic tale. I wonder why.. Strangely enough the the extras standing in the background all looked very Arabic/middle Eastern. They were being used as props it would seem. Anyone who doesn't feel like their intelligence is being insulted needs to pay a bit more attention. The story itself is lame and mind-numbingly repetitive, kind of like a video game. Oh yeah, this WAS based on a video game... and it shows; The whole film deals with people stealing a magical dagger from the other side, just to have it taken back again. The corrupt royal family steals the dagger from the Rogue (White) Prince, who looks like a surfer who wandered onto the set of 'The Arabian Nights.' Gyllenhal gets angry and he and his Princess, who looks a bit like Xena Warrior Princess, (really mid eastern looking too, huh.. especially with her freckles) take the dagger back. They exchange some witty (by idiot standards) banter before they are set upon again by the evil royals. The whole film goes on like this, and it is as enjoyable as watching someone else play a video game. I find it amazing that the same people who criticized 'The Last Airbender' actually like this tripe; 'Airbender' looks like 'Lawrence of Arabia' compared to this; it is a much better film, actually. The most unfortunate thing about 'Prince of Persia' is that it had real potential. The score was quite beautiful, and the costumes and set design were very good, (although not as great as 'The Last Airbender.' It seems Disney was afraid that if they cast real Middle Eastern types for the leads then this thing would not have had success. The sad thing is, they might be right. And the film could not be more inaccurate, historically; people swilling wine while two feet away women are wearing veils. Is this before the existence of Islam, or after? How come some women (in the background of course) must wear veils, while other women can walk around half naked, looking like Las Vegas showgirls? In the 30's and 40's, Hollywood would paint white people's skin, to pass them off as Asian, or Negro. It is sad that we haven't come very far, 80 years later. Maybe Hollywood doesn't realize that Asian actors do exist; they aren't all working in kitchen's or dealing drugs. But if you go into this noisy, tacky film, with the knowledge that it is based on a video game, then you shouldn't be too disappointed. set your standards low, just be glad that it isn't in 3-D.",5,0,2,21 September 2010
American History X," 2nd rate melodrama, unbelievably overrated..
","According to the IMDb list of the top 250 films of all time, THIS comes in at a staggering #44. If we are to go by this incoherent list, we are to believe that 'American History X' is a better film than Kubrik's 'Clockwork Orange.' It is superior to the 'Deer Hunter,' and the classic 'Third Man.' It even outshines Germany's epic masterpiece 'Der Untergang/Downfall.' After you are finished laughing, consider the film 'American History X,' a hack job so embarrassing that it's director, Tony Kaye wisely attempted to have his name removed from the final product. Why would a director want to deny responsibility for a film that is considered by countless idiots who consider this better than 'Metropolis??' Because 'A.H.X' is a mediocre film at best. From it's infantile, laughable, simplistic, and thoroughly inaccurate views on racism, to it's soap opera like melodrama, down to it's gross, comical overblown stereotypes, such as the ex-gang member 'uncle tom' preachings of Avery Brooks, as the black school principal, to the ultra stereotyped Jewish ideal, played by none other than Elliott Gould! Why weren't more people offended by this obnoxious representation of minorities? And of course, the skinheads were portrayed as ugly, stupid, and faceless monsters, with the exception of Hollywood movie star Ed Norton, who is a fine actor, but who was just too pretty to be believable here. A word of advice to future filmmakers: If you want to make a powerful statement about serious political issues, avoid using the latest Hollywood pin-up hunk to get the point across, as it just does not work. Remember Alan Pakula's 'Devil's Own' with Brad Pitt as the hunky IRA hero/terrorist? Enough said. Ed Norton plays Derek, a young man who turns into a hate preaching neo nazi skinhead after his fireman dad is shot while putting out a fire in the ghetto project. Norton does not look like he ever stepped foot inside a housing project, but that does not stop him from becoming the spokesperson/leader to a generation of mean, angry skinheads, all of which tower above Norton. And as good an actor as Norton is, I did not believe him in the role of a lower middle class skinhead; He sounded more like a sheltered private school boy trying to act tough. It seems that the filmmakers have never even met a real skinhead, as this portrayal was so unbelievably inaccurate. AHX makes the mistake that so many Hollywood films make; It attempts to manipulate our emotions with sad, wistful, dramatic music. This method was grossly overused here, and some of the dialog could barely be made out over the overpowering 'backround' music. More evidence of this films failings; if the script, and performances are good, we will feel the emotions on our own. Intelligent moviegoers do not need our emotions to be 'cued' by the appropriate music. This is a sure sign of a poor film. Derek's transformation from normal boy, to racist skinhead, to finally a strong, enlightened protector of his family and responsible brother/son, after an 'Oz' like stint in jail, would work fine, for a film made for television. But the fact that this thoroughly underwhelming movie scored so high on this website is proof enough that these ratings cannot be taken seriously. It saddens me that so many people cannot see the difference between truly good cinema, and mediocrity. It is more tragic that so many people can be this easily manipulated by this kind of Hollywood dreck. Having had the opportunity to view hundreds of films from around the world, I am not impressed by Hollywood's repeated attempts at making serious, intelligent films that deal with issues such as racism and poverty. Hollywood needs to stick with the flashy entertainment, the explosions, the comedies, the Sci-fi, as for this type of film-making, Hollywood can't be beat. And for those who want to see a truly good film dealing with the same subject matter as A.H.X, take a look at 'Mississippi Burning'. Here is a rare example of when Hollywood got it right; a well made, beautifully realized piece of cinema, that deals with the racism issue without being corny or ridiculous. As far as 'American History X' goes, do not believe the hype.",4,11,25,1 March 2007
The Butterfly Effect," Two hour MTV music video
","'Butterfly Effect' is the kind of movie that is quite entertaining the first time around, but on subsequent viewings the flaws become glaringly evident. The original idea was a good one, and in the hands of a competent film-maker, this could have been a classic. Unfortunately, the film looks like crap. The whole production has a cheap, MTV style look. Totally devoid of artistic flair, such as impressive camera angles or stylish lighting, this looks exactly like a cheapo TV show. I cannot fathom how something that looks like THIS has such a high rating on IMDb. The acting as well, is just about on TV show level as well. And I could not for one moment take the airhead 'surfer dude' Ashton Kutcher in a dramatic, serious role. This 'actor' doesn't look like he has ever experienced a real emotion in his life. Every character here was such a complete, phony stereotype; Hayley, molested by her dad, isn't just a wreck of a woman; She is the crack whore from Hell, complete with the facial scar. Or when things go right, she isn't merely a normal, well adjusted young woman; No, she is a living, breathing TV commercial, sorority girl in pink with the dork boyfriend. Ready to rule the world, just because she wasn't molested after all. And how did people contain their laughter at seeing Ashton Kutcher, fraternity boy with the yellow windbreaker and sports car? Everything here was just sooo extreme, and so outrageously;y exaggerated, as if we as an audience are so stupid, that we can only understand things in the most extreme stereotyped characters conceivable. Thumper, the obese roommate/buddy, absolutely laughable. Not only was the film poorly conceived, but it was offensive as well. exploiting subjects like sexual child abuse, prostitution, drug addiction, for the sake of making this tacky movie, pretty bad. And the absolute worst thing about this mess is that it seems to be making the arrogant, and highly ridiculous claim that it is somehow a film in the same vein as 'Seven', a film that is so superior to this MTV nightmare, that it is just ludicrous. During the scene where the kids, (who were the films only saving grace) were watching 'Seven' in a movie theatre, I really was wishing that I was watching that film instead of this one. And during the totally unbelievable 'prison sequence' I was wishing that I was watching 'American History X', or Sean Penn in 'Bad Boys'. Anything more realistic than a film where a 20 year-old Sorority babe says things like 'You said we were gonna be together forever, come Hell or High Water!' Are we supposed to believe that anyone under the age of 65, much less a Barbie doll sorority bimbo, actually uses terms like 'Come Hell or high water?!?' 'Butterfly Effect' has a good idea, but it has no idea of how to present it capably. I can see how people under 18 might think this is 'a cool flick', but it mystifies me that any intelligent adult would see this as a legitimate film. Yes, it is somewhat entertaining, and yes it is an ugly, 2 hour MTV video.",2,11,22,4 November 2006
Casualties of War," Dated, stagy Vietnam film
","DePalma is one of the most prolific American directors of our time, and has created some masterpieces such as 'Scarface' as well as some horror classics, 'Carrie' and 'Dressed To Kill.' 'Casualties of War possesses the same qualities that DePalma is recognized for; excellent, stylish camera-work and editing, a sense of intense drama, etc. his Vietnam war film even features a sweeping, epic score from Ennio Morricone. But for some reason he was not able to get one believable performance out of his usually talented cast. The usually brilliant Sean Penn delivers an embarrassingly bad performance as the bullying officer in command, complete with a cheesy, fake Brooklyn accent, while Michael J. Fox, (another talented actor) gives a typical, one dimensional characterization of the innocent by-stander, who must endure the horrors and corruption around him. his whole performance consists of making anguished faces and looking horrified or hurt. Strangely enough, the only memorable performance was given by the little-known actress who played the Vietnamese girl who is kidnapped, raped and murdered. The scenes of this girl suffering are genuinely harrowing, and her cries and look of utter horror at what is happening around her, will haunt many viewers long after they see it. This one had potential, given all the talent involved, but the hammy acting by the all-star cast, combined with an awful screenplay, sinks this one. The problem here is that 'Casualties' looks and feels too much like a 'movie.' This style works fine for other subjects, but when dealing with something like war, this was just not realistic or gritty enough. Recent films like 'Black Hawk Down' handle the subject much more effectively.",5,2,12,14 April 2010
Saw II," Tacky cash-in sequel 'oh, yes, there will be crap..'
","The original 'Saw' is a pretty good horror effort, for an American film, (although it can't compare with the stuff coming out of Japan.) It was bloody, but stopped right on the line of going overboard with the violence, which would have cheapened the film. It had a suspenseful story, with some real twists, and finally, a surprising, and satisfying ending. There were only two main characters, and this allowed for some focus on actual character development, and believable story. And so it received attention and praise, as something decent coming out of Hollywood these days is rare indeed. Unfortunately when a horror film is successful in the States, the parade of inferior sequels is inevitable. 'Saw 2' is no exception. First, lets state the obvious; You cannot make the same film twice and expect the same level of quality entertainment. The film makers here, seemed to want desperately to make a sequel that actually didn't suck. So they decided that they had to top the first one, by making it a hundred times bloodier. Well, they did succeed at that. And the first 'Saw' ended with a surprise finale, so they tried to think up another shocking last second revelation, to wow audiences. But this time they failed. Because the ending was contrived, and most of us saw it coming a mile away, because we know how the first one worked. And like I said, you can't pull the same trick twice, because we will always want something new, and different. At least when it comes to this type of film. Because films like 'Saw 2' have nothing else to offer, besides shocks and cheap thrills, and gore. There is not one scene in this film that is stylishly or artistically shot, or even competently shot for that matter. Most of the film looks like a TV cop show, or an MTV video.There is not one interesting character here (with the exception of Jigsaw himself). And this fact really sunk this film. Filled with the most insipid stereotypes imaginable. We have the macho dark-skinned drug dealer, the sexy Spanish-looking bad girl, the white bread 'honkie' who spends her entire time on camera crying with mascara running down her dirty face. We have one of the most ridiculous, one dimensional versions of 'the ex-junkie' that i have ever seen. We even have the 'token black guy'. It seems like the film makers were trying to make everyone like the film, by including a character that each one of us could relate to individually. I even found myself relating a little to the little juvenile delinquent with the estranged, cold father. Afterwards i realized what manipulative bull it all was. Nothing more than a money making ploy here. The thing that depresses me now, is how much some other people praised this film, some even saying it was better than the first film! Are todays moviegoers that stupid, that easily fooled? We should get one thing straight: Saw 2 is BLOODIER than Saw 1. That does not mean it is better. This film should only appeal to MTV and video game addicts, looking for gore set pieces and nothing else. And I will give credit where it is deserved; There are some good blood scenes here, including one of the most grisly and realistic throat-slashing scenes ever. Don't expect anything more, unless you have extremely low standards, or extremely poor taste in film. I will not be in attendance for the inevitable, (and inevitably stupid) 'Saw 3'.",2,2,3,15 October 2006
Green Street Hooligans," Fairly dumb & inaccurate, though entertaining drama
","It is interesting to note that the criticisms for 'Hooligans' is pretty much split evenly down the middle, with most American audiences praising this over-dramatized world of football hooligans, while the Brits can see this as the clichéd, sappy melodrama that it really is. As an ex US citizen, (I now reside in Germany) I was a bit saddened at how clueless many Americans really are as to what things are really like across the Atlantic. The Brits must have had quite a laugh at this unlikely tale concerning a Harvard University 'yank' named Matt, (played by Elijah Wood of all people) who gets kicked out of school and flies straight away to London, where he joins his boring sister and her boyfriend. It doesn't take him long to meet Pete, played effectively by the quite handsome Charlie Hunnam, (but sporting the fakest, most cringe-inducing Cockney accent I have ever heard), who introduces the small-in-stature Matt to the rough world of Hooligans. I am in no way a sexist, however this violent sub-culture is undeniably a 'guy thing', and it is obvious at times that this drama was directed by a woman. Though technically well-made, it is sometimes sappy, overly dramatic, and sickly sentimental, as is so typical for American films. Using dramatic music the film attempts to manipulate our emotions, especially the unbelievably corny song that plays over the final battle. A lot of the power that this film might have had was deflated by some unwise choice of music. This same approach helped to destroy another film dealing with similar subject matter, that film being 'American History X', another over-rated film. 'Hooligans' comes across as insincere and contrived. The actors were mostly fine, however Charlie's accent; if I, as a non- English person found Hunnam's Cockney to be awful, imagine what it sounds like to a London-born native. I understand why Hunnam was cast; he has screen presence, and a certain charm, but he obviously is no Brit. Are they afraid to cast an authentic English actor in a major film? Not to mention, Hunnam's character was way too young to be believable as the leader of a 'firm.' It is supposed to be realistic, especially with a film dealing with a subject like this. A film about hooligans is supposed to be hard, and this film is too sentimental to be 'hard.' Female director Lexi Alexander seems to have a certain respect for the scene, but she seems to romanticize it somewhat, and seems a bit out of her element here. It seems that Alexander has a fascination with this hard, violent and male dominated world, but she doesn't really have a true understanding as to what it is all about. I would advise all with an interest in the world of Hooligans and football violence to check out a film called 'Football Factory'. It seems to be quite a bit closer to the real deal. I admit though, that 'Hooligans' has it's moments. The close friendship that develops between Pete and Matt is nicely handled, and actually touching without being too corny. Their relationship is the best thing about the movie, although I thought it was lame when, at the films climactic rumble, when Pete gets his face beat in, that Matt didn't drop everything and run to his 'best mate'. That made me a little sick. Especially how it was presented in the end, that Pete had to lose his life, but it was worth it for the American guy to learn some stupid 'life lesson.'As a drama, 'Hooligans' is not bad, but as an expose into the world of hooligans and football violence, this doesn't make it. Filmmakers need to stop making films about subjects that they don't fully understand.",5,0,0,3 March 2007
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Unforgettable vision of human brutality..
","'Salo: 120 Days of Sodom' is quite simply the bleakest and most despairing vision of humanity you can can ever hope to see. A true 'horror film,' as it genuinely horrifies, without offering any pleasure one would expect from watching a film. For 'Salo' does not entertain, as it was not the intention of it's creator, the multi-talented genius Pier Paolo Pasolini. The film literally bleeds with a feeling of disgust and fury for the human condition. Old, jaded humans, so separated from their own humanity, can only feel satisfaction from taking from the innocent and beautiful young people, what had been taken from them by a cruel and corrupt world. 18 beautiful and virginal teens, locked away in an ornate palace by the Italian fascist regime, these four powerful men go to unimaginable lengths to corrupt the children. Inevitably, they fail to do so, and that fact is the only thing about the film that possesses a sliver of hope. Interestingly, the guards that are employed to watch over the enslaved children, are just around the same age as the teens. The guards are chosen it seems, because of the size of their penises. While they become completely, and hopelessly depraved and jaded to the horrors that they witness, the slave children never stop being horrified, terrified and sickened at the barbarity unfolding around them. If it was the intention to show what power does to the human soul, then this film succeeds in every regard. Many have seeked out this film hoping/expecting some prurient kick out of seeing the things described so many times. Only the most jaded of viewers will come away with that experience. i don't believe that 'Salo' was created to shock, and it most certainly was not made to titillate. For anyone who has any regard for humanity will only feel extremely saddened and depressed by witnessing it. 'Salo' holds nothing back, and the fact that the most cruel and vile punishments seem to be reserved for the most beautiful and sheltered children, make it even more grueling. Technically speaking, this might be Pasolini's most polished and professional-looking film. Apparently the young actors were not told anything about the actual subject matter, which is believable, as everyone involved seems genuinely uncomfortable, and mostly horrified with what they are involved with. At the time, to work with the most important director in Italy, was quite an opportunity and an honor, and the faith and trust that the actors put into this man, is something to behold. And as ugly as an experience as it is to sit through 'Salo,' there are admittedly moments of exquisite beauty to behold. And the few scenes where the children comfort and try to shelter each other, gives us all hope that innocence, as well as evil, can never be totally destroyed. So for those looking for some erotic or bloody entertainment, they would do better to look elsewhere. But for those who are mature enough, and prepared to be profoundly moved, and saddened, give this a look.",7,0,2,27 April 2010
Rocky," A Real Story
","This is what people want, real stories about people that they can relate to. The original 'Rocky' brilliantly captures one man's struggle so profoundly, so elegantly, that it is almost poetic. Stuck in a nowhere job, doing something for a living that literally makes him sick to his stomach, (who can relate to that?), Rocky is big and strong enough to work as a heavy...a debt collector for some nasty Philly loan sharks. The problem is, his personality doesn't fit with that kind of work, because he's a good guy, that likes people. So when he sees the opportunity to step into the ring with established Heavyweight Champion of the World, Apollo Creed, he takes his chance. Not for the opportunity to buy a Ferrari or gold chains or fur coats, but just so he can have a life that is better than the grinding poverty and hopelessness that he is living every day. He also has a good woman that he goes crazy for. Adrian isn't most people's idea of 'beautiful,' but Rocky loves this woman, and knows that he wants to give her everything.
Rocky enters the competition, and with the help of his trainer Mickey, (today an iconic movie character) he soon begins to believe in himself, and that he can win. And by some fluke...he DOES win, making Rocky Balboa a true local hero. His win also ENRAGES the Champ, Apollo Creed, who becomes obsessed with a rematch, in order to reclaim his title. That brutal second fight, is the culmination of one of the most dramatically powerful films of all time. It's conclusion literally had people cheering and rolling in the aisles. When was the last time you have seen that happen? 'Rocky' is great because it truly makes the point that any dream is attainable, if you truly believe in yourself. This movie also put the city of Philadelphia on the map. It's hard to think of Philly without thinking of Rocky and all the sequels. A special nod goes to the cinematography, which captures Philly in all it's dark, atmospheric glory. Followed by many sequels, all of them having a certain value in it's own way, and making a statement about the time in which they were made. And 'Rocky' was a film that had something that today's movies just don't have...it has a heart, and a soul.",8,0,0,15 July 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," Boring and lackluster
","Wow, the trailer made this film look so exciting and interesting. The final product however, is neither. The 2 hours leading up to the invasion of Bin Laden's fortress, are silly, and surprisingly un-engaging. Silly characters, having silly conversations about unrelated topics, most of them women for some reason. Jessica Chastain, who is grossly miscast here, is hunting Bin Laden with a passion, for no apparent reason however. She behaves as if she has been personally gang raped by AL Queada, the way she obssesses over his capture. The final scenes, which should have been intense and thrilling, came across as a bad 'Rambo' film, one where we care little about the end result. The way that the US troops busted into that compound and just began shooting everyone in sight, was disgraceful, and does nothing to change the negative opinion that much of the World has of America. I doubt that this film would have gotten much attention at all, if director Kathryn Bigelow hadn't won her Oscar, and if the subject matter was not so volatile. I'm quite surprised that a subject so fascinating was turned into such a boring film. This is one to skip in the theater. Wait for the DVD release; 'Zero Dark Thirty' is not really worth the price of admission. In fact, it is surprisingly bad..",4,36,76,7 January 2013
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Ornate, lushly filmed horror, with erotic overtones
","Now that some time has passed, Neil Jordon's beautiful work can be watched without obsessing so much over the stars who were involved. 'Interview' is an extravagant assault on the senses, filled with beauty, erotic and graphic violence, and wonderful, at times poetic dialog. To be sure, this is a Hollywood production, but with director Neil Jordon in charge, the film possesses that special 'arthouse' film look, with many scenes being too strange and dark to come across as typical Hollywood. Pitt is fine as Louis, the centuries-old vampire who recounts his sad and fascinating history to a nameless 'interviewer', played a bit too light by Christian Slater. If you dislike Tom Cruise and his films, as i do, you should not let his participation in the film dissuade you from seeing this; As the sinister Lestat, Cruise is barely recognizable, and gives here, what might be his finest performance. Obviously due to the subject matter, 'Interview' is a relentlessly dark film. There are a few short scenes of daylight in the beginning, until Louis is transformed. Then begins his life of eternal darkness. When I saw this in the theater, the effect of sitting in a darkened room watching a film that takes place entirely at night, really felt strange. Coming out of the theater I felt as though I had been away from the real world for a long time. Jordon's aesthetic vision, supported for once by the huge Hollywood budget, insured that 'Interview' looks gorgeous. The plantation that is Louis' first home, and then the Paris apartment are filled with exquisite antiques, ornate furnishings, gold framed mirrors, lace and velvet four-poster beds, etc, transporting the viewer into the 18th and 19th centuries, and lends an extra level of decadence to the lifestyle of these vampires. The costumes as well are breath-taking, and accurate to the time. The finest thing about this production though, is the beautiful, doll-like Claudia, the child-vampire, played by Kirsten Dunst. It is always terrifying and strange when a child is cast in such an evil role. Claudia's thirst for blood exceeds that of Lestat himself, and her total lack of remorse for the people she kills is the most haunting and disturbing thing about this. The approach to her character was very un-Hollywood, thankfully. Anne Rice's book evokes feelings of loneliness and a profound sadness, and those feelings translate well into Jordans film. 'Interview With the Vampire' is a very special, and at times superb cinematic delight, that was not ruined by it's over-exposed stars and commercialism. And those that love Gothic horror and period films should see this, and ignore it's Hollywood origins.",7,21,26,22 January 2007
The Nice Guys," A True Piece of Garbage
","This abortion of a film represents everything that is awful about Hollywood today. Obviously directed by some 20-something, spoiled brat who thought that showing kids using four letter words and being sexual, would make this piece of crap 'edgy.' Well it doesn't. Pathetic jokes that flop, and desperate attempts to shock with pointless nudity, are what this film is all about. Supposedly set in the 70's it even fails at that; the movie looks patently 2016. It tries to be sexy and comes across as pathetic. I'm sure this one scored points at frat houses throughout America. As a fan of everything 70's, this movie made me kind of sick. Definitely the worst thing Gosling has ever attached himself too, and Russell Crowe's career remains firmly in the toilet with this one. The saddest thing is the high score this thing has; has the intelligence level of the masses really declined this much? So sad..",4,3,6,3 July 2018
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Powerful and elegant directorial debut..
","With the release of 'In the Land of Blood & Honey,' actress Angelina Jolie has proved that she has much more to offer than 'just a pretty face.' She has created an exceptional film about the bloody and horrifying Bosnian war. The film details the struggle of Bosnian Muslims, as they are rounded up, imprisoned, and eventually slaughtered by the Serbian people, still holding a grudge against the Bosnians for injustices done to them during WW2. At the center of this uncomfortably intense film, are two unlikely 'lovers,' if one can call them that. Ajla, a Bosnian artist, and Danijel, a dedicated Serbian soldier, are thrown together in the middle of a political and religious war zone. Danijel struggles with his feelings for this woman, as they clash with a rabid hatred for her people, hammered into him by his father, a military man on his own personal crusade against people that he sees as less than human. Danijel's conflicting feelings turn him insane with paranoia. If you are expecting melodrama, think again; this film is very 'un Hollywood.' Stark, depressing and realistic, and free of showy, flowery speeches and war scenes. Jolie must be a great admirer of World cinema, as her film is done in this ultra-realistic style. For instance, the overbearing orchestral music that Hollywood films are known to have, is totally absent here. Most scenes play without any orchestral score, and even during the most intense scenes, the music is very low, so as not to distract from what is happening. I was impressed by Jolie's choices throughout. The look of 'Land of Blood & Honey' is cold, and starkly beautiful. The interior shots are as gloomy and sinister as one would imagine them to be, and the outdoor scenes of snowy landscapes and Eastern block architecture, are haunting and desolate. There are no fake movie sets in this film, and happily, no high profile movie stars to destroy the realism of the production. Jolie made the wise decision to cast local actors, who speak their own language, rather than casting American actors speaking with ludicrous Bosnian/Serbian accents. The two leads were wonderful; Zana Marjanovic was strong and utterly believable as Ajla, and Goran Kostic portrayed Danijel as a man desperately trying to keep his sanity intact, as his father pulls him in one direction and his passion for Ajla, in the opposite. This film has garnered endless controversy over the fact that it has chosen a side, and tells the story from the Bosnian perspective. But this is a movie, and that is the structure of film; the audience needs to have someone to empathize with, as well as a villain to despise. Perhaps Serbian people don't want to be reminded of how some of their people acted during this time, just as many Germans today are uncomfortable with their own history. But this film has been unjustly slammed by people, who claim that it's a bad movie, when that could not be further from the truth. 'In the Land of Blood & Honey' is an impressive debut, from a woman that is obviously concerned with World issues, and I hope to see Ms. Jolie in the directors chair again.",8,6,19,10 January 2013
