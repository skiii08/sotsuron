Black Swan," Incredible!
","I have just watched this film for the first time, on the off chance, after seeing an interview recently with Natalie Portman where she discussed the film.I have never before seen a Darren Aronofsky film and can tell you I was not disappointed, in fact I was mesmerised. The film is completely compelling, I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen, I was literally gripped.Stand out performances from both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis. An incredible, outstanding film that I would recommend to any real cinema fans!",10,3,7,31 December 2010
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Awesome!
","I do not understand how this film has had so many bad reviews, any real Twilight fan will absolutely love this film. Critics have said it was slow but I did not find it slow at all. I thought it was very romantic,the wedding and honeymoon scenes were great and think they will make any woman want to be loved like that! The action scenes were also great and the effects on making Bella look so ill were brilliant.I didn't think this would be as good as Eclipse but it was excellent and I will be watching it again this weekend for sure! Stay to the end of the credits for an extra scene!",Null,4,12,18 November 2011
Bad Teacher," Dire - absolutely terrible!
","I was looking forward to seeing this movie as the trailers seemed pretty humorous. Boy, was I disappointed! Now, firstly, I am no prude, but this film was very crude, unexpectedly so. The character of Miss Squirell was just plan irritating, Justin Timberlake's character was a little bit cringe worthy to watch and Cameron Diaz wasn't even remotely likable in any way. I know she was supposed to be a nasty piece of work, but you have to at least have some like for the characters to enjoy a movie. The only saving grace was Jason Segel who was pretty much the only likable and humorous character in the film.I am glad I have an unlimited cinema card and did not pay to watch this drivel, as I almost considered walking out half way through, and for a free film, thats pretty bad! Don't waste your money or time people.",1,11,24,24 June 2011
Inception," Really????
","Firstly I want to say that I am fan of clever films that challenge the brain, however, it is possible for a film to be so complicated, and frankly...boring, that it becomes difficult to hold your interest. This was definitely the case with this movie.Obviously the visual effects were excellent, that goes without saying, but I left the movie thinking 'what was the actual point?'. I am sure a lot of people must just be jumping on the band wagon by rating this movie highly, of perhaps pretending to get it, as I am positive I cannot be the only one that found this film over complex and just plain rubbish. In fact, I heard many of the people saying similar things as they left the cinema.I like a film to entertain me, and having heard everyone raving about this film I was bitterly disappointed to find it was a total 'try too hard' yawn-fest. The concept was good, however it just didn't hit the mark and was thoroughly un-entertaining. I found myself drifting off wondering about what I would eat for dinner,and about things I needed to do at work the next day, and that is the sign of a BAD movie.9.2 out of 10? I don't think so, but each to their own.",2,4,14,27 July 2010
