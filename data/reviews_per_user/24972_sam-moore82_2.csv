Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Certainly worth watching for pure enjoyment that beats the last movie to death
","I speak for allot of people when i say how long we have been waiting for a number 2 after the good work done by number 1. Number 2, a game of shadows is certainly worth the wait, despite the trailer looking a little bit of a step down. First the plot. The story carries on from the cliffhanger at the end of the first, when Moriarty, a mysterious man with a concealed face, steals a weapon at the end and Sherlock ends with the lines 'Case reopened.' This sets this one up with homes practically devoted to finding out what he is up to and, of coarse Watson becomes involved and they end up travelling across Europe on the brink of a war between France and Germany. Its a step up from the last which was more about England and England alone. The hole of the western world is now in consideration. How this works with the character of Holmes is better than what i thought and this effects the plot in a significant way. Moriarty is a weapons dealer and so on but has friends in high places. ALLOt of high places so a war is in his interests and Holmes thinks he is the one who caused a series of explosions that, of coarse, France blames Germany for and vice verca. the whole mechanics behind this and how Holmes figures each step out is brilliant and, when he isn't doing that, hes getting into a fight or two. The slow down moments where Holmes devises his enemies take down has adapted to be better and way more flashy and there's allot of slowdowns in the action, maybe too much at points and you just want it to get on with it, but when it works, it is proper quality and makes it unique to any other movie. Seeing individual bullets slowly whizz past, breaking up trees and skimming clothes is great. There's great use of CGI and that really helps with some situations that i wouldn't imagine fitted with sherlock Holmes, but it does and it does it well. The plot is interesting and keeps you watching, but its the whole Holmes-Watson relationship which really keeps the humour and plot moving. Also, Mary also returns as a slightly more significant character, as does Eirine as a slightly pointless character that should of just been left and Lestrade as my favourite character with only one line. The last two should of been in it more as how good they were in the first, though this still is good without them playing that much of a part in it. What makes it also brilliant (without spoilers) is that the ending sequence with the plot isn't about action. There's no big fight (that actually happened, anyway) but the mechanic, the use of a chess game, the use of what was thought pointless moments of the movie actually being very significant is brilliant and ends great. There is a reason to be sad at the end however, so bring a tissue",10,0,3,25 December 2011
Up," One of my favourite movies of all time
","First lets say I am NOT a massive fan of Pixar movies. Sure, I've had my fair share of them, but it's not really a genre i'm overly fussed about. They were nothing more than fun entertainment made for all the family to watch and enjoy. Enter Up, a tale about a grumpy old man who, after a lifetime of misery and misfortune, goes on an adventure to the land he always dreamed of going to, bringing his house with him. The house isn't the only thing he brings with him, however, and he finds a small child named Russel tagging along for the journey too. What makes Up so interesting is the way it isn't just a typical run of the mill Pixar-type film. It's got all the elements of a comedy that you would expect already (with characters such as Russel adding a sense of light and happiness to the tale and a nice contrast to the more secluded and lonely character of Carl, and talking dogs bringing a relatable and goofy humour that keeps things moving) but the tale also stretches to be emotionally engaging. Carl's story is an emotional one and you really feel sorry for his character from very early on in the story. The first 10 minutes will make you cry (no joke) simply because it's such a relatable and down to earth issue yet effects his character in such a great way that really makes you understand why he is how he is. Towards the end of the movie you really do feel connected to his character and really want him to finally get the happiness he deserves. That's something that movies of ALL genres fail to pull off on a regular basis. The progression of the story is a little hit and miss, and elements such as a bad guy don't feel well placed or even necessary at all, but it does its job of continuing the story, mainly down to the great voice acting and writing, along with some real toung-in-cheek references to movie classics (Independence day fans will get what I mean) Whilst the movie could have been shorter, and a few scenes were a little pointless, by the end you really feel satisfied you were watching a well made and full movie. People of all ages can enjoy this movie. One of the best movies I have ever watched, and certainly the most solid from an emotional standpoint. I highly recommend this, whatever your age or movie tastes, for anyone to watch and enjoy.",9,0,1,8 February 2013
