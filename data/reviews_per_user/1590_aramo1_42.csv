The Devil's Advocate," Beautifully crafted cheat.
","Based on R2 DVD 138 mins.One of Reeves' better performances, Pacino gives his part great gusto and Theron is more than convincing. There are some great visual treats , several biblical allusions [temptations of Christ] and subtle jokes as well like Pacino mode of transport.All things considered this should be a 7/10 alas the movie, like so many others, falls at the final jump and contradicts all that has gone before. If one were to think it through the actual screened ending predicts a far worse fate then the one reached about 3 minutes earlier.6/10 worth watching.",6,1,2,24 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Big money space western with regal trimmings
","Based on R1 DVDLet's see there is the democratically elected queen whose identity is so such a big secret even the members of other governments don't know what she looks like. There's a virgin birth. There's a herd of cow brained creatures who have a very high tech underwater civilisation, an evil trade federation headed by a viceroy, an inept republic run by civil servants and a smattering of WW2 jap & nazi military types. Much of it makes little sense but none the less there is the Lucas touch that so few others have, namely the ability to bring truely fantastical beings to life.Low brow sci-fi with great eye candy - kids should love it.",5,0,1,9 December 2001
Meet the Parents," Good, not great.
","Based on R2 DVD 103 minThere's a touch of the slapstick about this better then average comedy, De Neros' character (ex CIA black ops) is interesting and at times very funny. If you like action comedy then this will appeal and while it fails to provoke a hearty belly laugh it's still good for a giggle.6/10 worth watching.",6,0,0,25 February 2002
Fight Club," Enjoyable mayhem
","Based on R2 DVD 134 min.I must confess this movie left me with a sense of 'why the hell was that about?'. None the less it is engrossing and enjoyable while it runs through its two and a quarter hours of mayhem, madness, some rather gruesome violence and brief pornographic moments.It would have been nice had the movie stayed a little closer to story setup in the first half hour, which played a little more intelligently then the story that finally unfolded.6/10 worth watching.",6,1,4,11 August 2002
Memento," A disturbing concept well exploited.
",For anyone who forgets things (who doesn't) this film presents a disturbing view of workings of the human mind. You'll need to pay attention thoughout and most especially during the flashbacks the final scenes. Overall this movie requires more effort from viewers than most but the effort is well rewarded.,8,1,3,13 October 2001
12 Angry Men," Table chair action.
",It must be a good story when 12 men in a simple room with only a flip board for props can keep you engrossed for the entire lenght of the movie. By the end of the film I felt I knew the 'black kid' and half his neighbourhood - good story very well told.,8,1,2,14 November 2001
Blade," The Matrix owes a lot to Blade
","Interesting twist on the Vampire yarn - fast, loud and moody. Despite my initial fears Kris K carries his part reasonably well and Snipes aka Blade provides a formidable physical presence. Lots of blood, steel, silver, burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable :) 110 minute distraction. IF you like the black look of The Matrix then Blade will appeal to you, Blade even has a 'dodge the bullets' sequence.",7,0,1,6 October 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," Average all round
","Based on R1 (Canada) DVD 98 minutes.Echos of Adrian Mole with much toned down humour. Bridget (Ren√©e Zellweger) is 31, single and keeps a diary - this is their story. Zellweger plays the part well, Grant is the predictable cad with Firth donning the role of the decent though often misunderstood chap.Aside from Bridgets solo routines the humour lacks sparkle, chemistry is absent, the story is predicable and everything is decidedly average.Watch it, miss it - doesn't matter much.5/10",5,1,1,28 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Worth watching, read 'The Hobbit' first.
","Based on Irish cinema release As viewed by adult and 10 year old nephew.Best film of the year? Maybe. Worth watching? Definitely.OK, the film makes concessions to people who have not read the novels that many would disagree with but over all it does a more than adequate job of getting the basic story on screen. Many; 10 year olds included; may be confused as to why some of the characters behave the way they do, why was Frodo able to resist the power of the ring while Boromir fell so easily to its persuasive powers or was Saruman ever a good wizard and how did he come so under the sway of Sauron. Perhaps, given the scale of the original 'Fellowship of the Ring' it is inevitable that a good deal of story and character compression has to be done - for the most part the film does a very good job of presenting the core of the story to the great unread, hopefully it will encourage more than a few to read Tolkiens' original work before Christmas 2002. Young and old alike may benefit from reading 'The Hobbit' before accepting Hollywoods vision middle earth.",8,0,0,27 December 2001
American Psycho," If you can't blind them with brilliance...
","Based on R2 DVD 98 minThere's an Irish saying 'if you can't blind them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit' which fits like a soft glove around American Psycho. The movie is visually stunning and contains moments of brilliance but for many of its 98 minutes it's bullshit in the finest pop art tradition. Perhaps some insightful frustrated alpha males can see more but most will come away wondering what it was all about.6/10 worth watching",6,0,0,1 June 2002
U-571," Germans are so dumb the war should have been over in 6 days.
","Based on Collectors Edition DVD.I looked forward to watching U-571 with relish, U-boats and the Enigma machine a story made in heaven. Alas the story is not about the Enigma machine and despite the very impressive sets it's not even about submarines or submariners it's a story about an XO coming of age.A few irritating things about the movie (1) given a few hours and a little plaque the US Navy can make one of their 'old' subs look like a U-boat (2) Germans are portrayed as ineffective unable to do anything with their own U-boat which the Yanks can then fix in a hour (3) Bad guys can't shot (4) lots of weary creaking metal (5) impersonating a German officer is OK (6) who actually sank the 1st sub and why (7) why not use marines (8) can you really whisper into a microphone and have a guy in an engine room hear you? Also the tension building scenes are imho overdone as are some of the fight scenes.Despite the above the movie has very good sets which might add to the sense of being there, if you like sub movies you'll probably put up with the flaws.",6,1,4,22 November 2001
American Beauty," Surprisingly good for a hit movie
",Based on R2 DVD IRLAside for some wonderfully off-beat acting the most surprising thing about this movie for me is that it did so well on general release. Hopefully it will inspire others to make well funded intelligent movies.TBH I was a little sleepy when I first viewed it but it merits a second viewing with is more than can be said for most movies.7/10 well worth watching,7,0,0,16 February 2002
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Good guy, bad guy, damsel and kid.
","Based on R2 DVD 147 min.Very good action, middling sci-fi. Personally I think the T1000 is under rated and Patrick does a great job of keeping a poker face throughout the the gross indignities he endures. The SFX were, and still are, very good and used intelligently.Best moment was Arnies' attempt at a smile which was seriously funny and machine like.As to the time travel - well the writers use it but never bother to let it get in the way of the action.7/10 well worth watching.",7,0,0,24 July 2002
Save the Last Dance," Some fancy footwork & ham acting.
","Based on DVD releaseSo they are still making movies about black boy white girl 'it's never work'. In a sense they are right in that Styles and Thomas are good at looking good but there is little beneath the colour.Some slamin' dance moves, lots of morality and a weak story.5/10 catch it on TV",5,1,3,22 June 2002
Dark City," Wonderfully creation.
","Based on R2 DVD 97 min.Dark city is as much about 'the city' as those who inhabit it, it is a wonderful moody creation a mix of film noire and science fiction. The basic ideas have turned up in sci-fi novels before but this is the best transfer to film I've ever seen, it's a smart version of the equally enjoyable 'The Matrix'.8/10 minor classic (for sci-fi fans)",8,1,3,12 September 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Pretty cars, pretty dumb.
","Based on R1 DVD 107 minYeap if you like looking at 'go faster strips' this is the movie for you. If you want half a plot or something resembling a script, look elsewhere. In it's favour there are maybe four good car race/stunt scenes - about 5 minutes worth.Vin Diesel gives it a good shot but his over night blood brother relationship with pretty face O'Connor (Paul Walker) strains all credibility. As for the rest of the crew, they  should have stayed in bed.5/10 a must see for 'go faster strips' fans.",5,0,1,29 April 2002
The Exorcist," Still powerful after all these years.
","Based on R2 DVD 119 min with directors introduction.To someone with no interest in the history of cinema or a peep hole to earlier times The Exorcist would be a good horror movie with a bit more story than action. To anyone older than 30 it has lost little of its original power to shock and provoke.I don't buy the 'you take from the exorcist what you bring to it' line, which sounds like 90s (or was is 80s) spin - the good guys win but at a high price and little girls are not to be trusted ;- 7/10 well worth watching in any time.",7,1,2,23 May 2002
American History X," Sure of its assumptions but still powerful
","Based on R2 CDA story with several powerful moments and fine performances by the lead actors. It's perhaps a little unfortunate that the neo-nazi movement is presented as cardboard caricature, while this allows the main story to progress at a faster pace the explanations as to why both the brothers 'bought into' it as less than compelling. The motivation behind Dereks' about face is also a little forced but engaging to watch.7/10 well worth watching",7,0,2,10 February 2002
Ocean's Eleven," 50% sting 50% caper 100% entertaining
",Based on R1 DVD 117 minClooney and Pitt prove to be a stong combination in this intelligent if slightly confusing; perhaps deliberately so; movie. The director keeps a few tricks hidden from the view but the cast is so good; and the leads so scampish that it's impossible to work up any resentment.7/10 well worth watching,7,0,1,1 June 2002
Hardball," Yet another - might have been great movie
",Based on R1 DVDThis movie has all the ingredients of a great 'mentor is redeemed by the kids he inspires' film. Alas it never quiet comes together. Reeves tries to get into the part and the kids are charming but the cheap by the numbers story line demeans everything.There is a low level romantic interest and a lot of ham directing.5/10 catch it on TV,5,3,5,8 March 2002
Tigerland," Great cast of unknowns make this a good movie.
","Based on R2 DVD 97 minGritty, being there, drama about young men training to kill and trying to be men. Two things stand out with Tigerland, one good the other bad.On the good side the quality of the mostly unknown cast is excellent, Colin Farrell carries most of the movie with apparent ease and gives it a charm and spirit of his own.On the bad side the roving reporter style camera work is very hard on old eyes and makes watching this movie on a portable DVD player most unpleasant.6/10 worth watching - point deduced for camera work.",6,0,1,24 May 2002
The Princess Bride," Great for kids and ol' fogies alike
","Based on R1 DVD 98 minCharming, witty, full of adventure and only a few kissie bits this is would make a great 'family' rental. The film delights in both poking fun at themes while providing great examples at the same time e.g. the duel at the top of the cliffs of insanity would shame Erol Flynn yet manages to be very tongue in cheek.Whatever your age this is a great cheer me up movie.7/10 well worth watching",7,2,4,13 June 2002
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Speilberg did this?
","Based on R2 DVD 123 minTaken on its own merit JP2 is a sci-fi movie with above average production values, good effects, a reasonable story and a few good; if long winded; stunts. If anything the movie is too long, the last 30 minutes should never have been shot.Considering this is a sequel to JP1 and directed by Speilberg it is a major disappointment. Most of the characters are card board and many of the situations are boringly predictable and contrived. The entire T-Rex in the city sequence makes a mockery of the island portion of the story. There is no explanation for who or what killed the ships crew but it had to be small enough to fit through the bridge door.6/10 worth watching if your a gore/sci-fi fan and if you forget about Speilberg and JP1.",6,0,1,21 January 2002
Meet Joe Black," Poker faced fantasy
",Based on R2 DVD 173 minOn reading the plot for 'Meet Joe Black' I was unsure what sort of movie to expect - I mean Death to me is DEATH of Pratchett fame.This movie plays the fantasy as straight drama and does it rather well. Pitt looks great and Hopkins acceptance of his strange fate if quite believable. The movie is long at almost 3 hours but didn't seem so.6/10 worth watching.,6,1,2,16 January 2002
Pi," Initially clever and absorbing but takes too long
","Genius and paranoia are strongly portrayed but the film takes too long to get to the downbeat and depressing punchline i.e. that some things are best not understood. Some graphic, disturbing and gory scenes.",4,0,1,17 February 2001
The Evil Dead," Scream 'til you laugh
","Based on R2 DVD'Evil Dead' goes beyond over-the-top corny into a dim unknown place that gives you an occassional fright but mostly it's good for a laugh. Fans of low budget B movies should be thrilled, being fond of a good horror myself I found the movie most entertaining. Now where's my copy of Evil Dead 2!7/10 well worth watching - gallons of gore.",7,0,1,1 February 2003
From Dusk Till Dawn," Ain't Clooney a cool baddie
","Based on R1 CDThis is a surprising good indie movie and very good twist on an old theme. All the main actors and several of the supporting ones perform very well.The dramatic change of theme about half way thru the movie catches the performers, and the viewers who have managed to avoid the spoilers, by surprise. If you want to get the full impact of this movie just trust the IMDB voters score (6.6) and watch it without reading any more reviews.As expected with Tarantino about, lots of blood and guts, artistically done of course :)7/10 well worth watching [banned in Ireland to boot]",7,0,1,19 January 2002
The Big Blue," Big Blue is a deep one.
","Based on R2 DVD 160 minThis is based on the European version of the movie, the shorter American version is not to be recommended.This is a deep, philosophical almost, story. It explores the relations between two men and the sea. Some of the cinematography is breathtaking.Sometimes it can be confusing, I'm still unsure how the depth record is established despite several scenes having been devoted to it.7/10 well worth watching",7,3,5,22 April 2002
A Clockwork Orange," No one would dare make this movie in 200x
",Based on R2 DVD.Following '2001' by three years 'Clockwork Orange' closely resembles its predecessor in form if not content. 'Clockwork Orange' also has a degree of on the cuff political cynicism not seem in later Kubrick movies and it's all the better for it.The stong visual nature of the movie is pure Kubrick though it's a certainty that no serious producer or director of the 2000s would dare emulate the style - thanks be for DVDs.8/10 classic material.,8,0,1,25 April 2002
Reservoir Dogs," Crime doesn't pay
",The story of five strangers brought together to pull off a diamond heist and their reactions when things go very wrong. Movie buffs see a lot of good things in this film but aside from a lot of blood and what I assume might have been a very grisly torture scene [C4 may have cut that a bit] it boils down to an unusual and mildly interesting violence movie which more character development than the norm.,6,1,3,23 November 2001
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Gritty look at East End crime
","Despite the blood and language this is not a particularly violet film, it does have moments of tension filled humour and a gritty realism that has been taken up by several other films. Long Good Friday and Way of the Gun fans should like this one.",7,0,0,29 October 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Big budget soso movie
","Based on R2 DVD 146 min.While there is nothing wrong with Harry Potter I and while it will no doubt delight many preteens it is all wrapper and no present. I read the first chapter of the book upon which the movie is based to my nephew a few months back and based on that alone expected greater things from the movie.Wonderful special effects, good child actors but hollow compared to Lord of the Rings, Princess Bride or even Dungeons and Dragons.6/10 worth watching, the younger the better.",6,0,1,20 July 2002
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Redemption and the power mad woman.
","Based on R1 DVD 134 minutes.I recall being very impressed with this movie during its original cinema release, now 25 years later I have the chance to enjoy it again on DVD.The main theme of inmate being wiser than the doctors is convincing, especially in the relationship between McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and Chief. All the crazy actors give good to very good performances. The film has many touching and humorous moments while avoiding sentimentality.Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) is a fine example of female abuse of power, she is spiteful, cold and intelligent. Given an opportunity she is prepared to inflict considerable pain on her defenseless male charges.The movie fails to make my 'all time great' list but it is worth visiting or revisiting if you have the chance.7/10",7,0,1,28 December 2001
Vanilla Sky," Beautiful, twisted movie.
","Based on R1 DVD 136 min.I've only watched 'Vanilla Sky' once and; like Memento; it is a movie that demands repeated viewing. For what it's worth I made the mistake of watching this movie without reading any of the better reviewers [e.g. Ebert] so I dismissed several of the early warning cues as directorial slips - my mistake.This movie is visually beautiful, the characters are solid, there is a unquestionable chemistry between Cruise and the leading ladies. Diaz gives a powerful performance as both the playmate and later.Sci-Fi, conspiracy and psychological thriller fans should all find much to like in this movie, the strong cast and sheer beauty will give it a far wider appeal.If you are about to watch 'Vanilla Sky' for the first time here's a tip - listen very carefully to the first few minutes.8/10 minor masterpiece",8,0,0,12 August 2002
Final Destination," Don't blink, Death is fast and furious.
","Based on R2 CDWhen death is out to get you at lot happens and happens fast! This movie is a great combination of black humor, horror and basic thriller. Some of the scenes require close attention as the action can be very tight. Who's left standing is predictable from the beginning but it doesn't take from enjoying the movie.One of the most enjoyable chillers I've seen in some time.7/10 well worth watching.",7,0,2,19 March 2002
Munich," Boring and not credible
","I've no political skin in the actual events that took place in 1972 I simply want to watch a decent story told by a master story teller. After 20 minutes I was a little bored after 40 minutes my frustration grew as unlikely event was piled on unlikely event.
Sometimes out motley crew are inept gun slingers sometimes bungling bombers and on one occasion they are part of a crack commando unit. It is very difficult to believe this movie is actually based on real work events and I suspect a good many real events have been omitted to paint our heros in a favourable light.",6,2,3,4 January 2020
The Matrix," Great Sci-Fi and effects
","Based on R2 DVD 131 minObviously I'm a sap for the combination of ideas and images that go into the making of the Matrix. If the black wet look, computers, hackers and wapping great conspiracy theories are your thing then you're going love this movie. Agent Smith deserves a special mention for his line delivery.The movie glosses over a few points e.g. (1) exactly how out heros get in and out of the Matrix (2) when Agent Smith cracks up what happened the original host - none of it matters :)I now look out for Reeves, Fishburne, Pantoliano and Moss in just about any movie - so far I've not been disappointed.8/10",8,0,0,8 December 2001
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," More a long 'Flying Circus' than a movie.
",Based on R1 DVD 92 min.This is more a series of silly to very funny sketches ala Flying Circus than a movie. Obviously a must see for any Python fans but it should have a broader appeal to a new generation. Life of Brian remains the teams best effort.7/10 well worth watching.,7,1,2,4 June 2002
Donnie Darko," Refreshingly different, weak ending.
","Based on R1 DVDDonnie Darko; as the imdb genre listing suggests; is a difficult movie to pigeon hole. No a bad thing either, the movie keeps you trying to work it out all the way up to the less than satisfying ending. Astute viewers will have figured out half the ending well before it arrives but it would have been nice to see the Sparrow plot line developed.People who avoid sci-fi shouldn't, it is more mystery than science.Both the director Richard Kelly and Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) have established they are names to look out for in future movies.7/10 well worth watching - last 10 minutes lost a point.",7,0,0,18 April 2002
Jurassic Park," Class act by all involved.
","Based on R1 DVD 122 minWell above average sci-fi action movie. Sam Neill (Dr. Alan Grant) is near perfect for the part of the hands on scientist, Richard Attenborough (John Parker 'spared no expense ' Hammond)is a delight. The kids are good but one has to wonder why Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) bothered to turn up at all.7/10 well worth watching",7,3,5,20 January 2002
All the President's Men," As valid today as 30 years ago.
","Based on R2 DVD 133 min.This movie is a pretty straight retelling (from the Washington Posts pov) of the events leading up to Nixons' resignation. The producers were under legal and political pressure at the time so the movie plays it pretty safe, the story is still gripping. The collusion of the intelligence agencies should remain a concern for all Americans. Some interesting nuggets covered in the extra features: Nixon was reelected to a second term (after the Watergate break-in) with massive public approval, in 1970 Nixon greatly expanded the budget and scope of the intelligence agencies.7/10 well worth watching - extra point awarded for historical interest.",7,1,3,10 June 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," and the music is good too
","Based on R2 DVD 103 minThough not a fan of comedy [Python excluded] this movie was a joy to watch. The Coen brothers must hand pick actors for roles as all the actors seem perfect for the parts they play. Clooney {Gable look alike or what?) deserves a special mention, he is proving to be a very versatile actor.The gags are low key but there are plenty of them, the KKK gathering is a hoot and the music is; like the movie; surprisingly good.7/10 well worth watching",8,0,0,20 January 2002
