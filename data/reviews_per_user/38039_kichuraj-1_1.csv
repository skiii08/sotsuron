United 93," disgusting!!!!!!
","With all due respect to the bravery of the men and women who perished in that fateful flight, this movie is the ultimate perverse transgression on human decency as I have seen it. 1. There is no proof for what happened. It is all speculation 2. There is theory/evidence to negate certain claims such as the phone calls made from the flight. 3. The crash of flight 93 itself is quite dubious (www.loosechange911.com) 4. The glorified heroism with carefully punctuated dialogues, the stunning visuals with a haunting background score DO NOT make this movie anything more than a merely well-written work of fiction. I am disappointed at the studios for trying to exploit the tragedy but I am certainly disgusted at the American public who have bought into this propaganda without even realizing it. Anybody who voted for the movie' technical production values, I admire your neutrality. Anybody who thinks this is a great movie about the courage of people who 'saved' your 'freedom', you are just a dumb ass who is probably too dumb to even know it..adios,",1,29,83,2 May 2006
