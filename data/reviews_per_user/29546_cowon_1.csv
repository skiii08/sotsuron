Ali," ridiculed
","It is really afflicting to see that an history with a lot of potential was ridiculed... Ali was a god, the best boxer of all time... but in this movie, he's minimized by a poor screenplay and a trash story... Who have permitted it??? A guy with no honnor??? no sense??? no talent??",3,0,0,1 May 2002
