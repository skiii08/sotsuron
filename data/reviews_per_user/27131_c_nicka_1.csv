The New World," chaotic, incomprehensible dialog, too long, no discernible plot
","Biggest waste of time ever, Anyone who would edit a film with black dissolves instead of editing material to flow from one scene to another should be producing stills for 3-D viewers. Most of dialog completely inaudible, leaving one to guess as to names of characters, relationships etc. Development of affection between John Smith and Pocahontas (never called by name)consists of 'meaningful glances' which could be confused with indigestion. At one time colony seems to be down to about 10 people and then during the battle scene there seems to be dozens, if not hundreds. Background music bears no relation to flow of film, too loud during dialog exchanges and non existing during tedious shrubbery and grass pampas scenes. All in all a completely unsatisfactory rendering of a historical dramatic period with many fascinating characters.",1,6,10,20 January 2008
