Vertigo," Amazing
","There is not much to say about this movie, except than it should definately be seen by anyone that considers himself a movie lover. It is amazingly suspenseful. It gets in your mind, in a slow, devious and viperish way. Agony and torment is deriving from the human mind - rather than the actual going-ons or plot of the film. It is a film than can be read in many layers, like the halucinational dreams and obsessions of the main character, that linger between reality and fantasy. Reality is what we make of it... and Hitchcock sure knows how to play with the viewers and his characters mind.The best thing is he still remains the master of his kind. MUST NOT miss it. I think it is his best film.",10,2,4,7 July 2003
G.I. Jane," No reason of existence for this film
","Sorry to say that but this film was really meaningless.What happened to Ridley Scott? Where are the 'Blade runner' and 'Thelma and Luise' days? A viewer is constantly under the impression that the director is really bored to do his job with this film. No meaning, no message, no nothing. If it is supposed to denounce political corruption or racism it definately fails to do so. Besides, Demie Moore was definately chosen for her appeal at that time rather than her acting abilities. A film with no reason of existence. Even 'Gladiator' was better than this.",2,15,32,15 April 2003
Billy Elliot," very good film
","When 'Billy Elliot' was first released in theaters, I consciously chose not to see it - I had a negative bias for no particular reason, really, even thought it was a very big hit. I guess I was tired of 'british suburbs' films that make you depressed: I used to find them interesting but, then, after a certain point I felt they started becoming repetitive and 'dead ended' like the lives they describe. So, when I practically bumped on the film in the TV, minute by minute I found myself being pleasantly surprised by what I was watching. Now, I believe it is one of my favorite films. What 'Billy Elliot' manages to do is give a tender and tough, bitter and sweet, at the same time, taste of reality in the life of the boy. It makes a story with out the American- type 'emotionalism', with the correct dosage of laughter, compassion and questioning for the viewer. The thin line between social criticizing is very well kept in the film, since it does not try to take a stand nor in politics (like Ken Loach would) or in other issues presented (such as homosexuality): it rather prefers to show the impact on the boys life, through his own eyes. In general very well directed and very well acted, music bonds very well with the action. Do not miss it.",8,0,0,14 March 2007
Lost in Translation," the Bitter sweet taste of encountering..
","Such a great film.. 'just like honey' - like the song from Jesus & Mary Chain of the soundtrack.. What is beautiful is that Coppola surpasses the obstacle: usually it is very hard to depict the connection that can occur when you meet certain people - the interaction between people is something vague and fragile but very substantial at the same time. Sofia Coppola manages to show the bitter sweet taste of sharing things that need not be told in words between two total strangers. I loved it. And the reason is that it combined the pulse of American filmaking with the aura and beauty of European cinema. Tokyo is the best background, Both Bill Murrey and Scarlet Johansson are great, and DO NOT forget to buy the soundtrack.",9,1,2,18 December 2004
The Pianist," At last, a good film after a very long time
","At last, a very good film after such a long time. Polanski's 'Pianist' is different than most films about the Jews story on the WW II. Apart from the description of the atrocities -that happen 'around' the main character and are often implied rather than described- this film is also about man's love for music, a love that, even if not obvious, survives the agony of every day survival, of hunger and thirst. Music surpasses nationalities, war and fear. The film is narrating a story of a man -not a hero- and is a simple and honest picture of human emotions that emerge on extreme situations - situations caused by man himself. Mr Brody is a very emotional and expressive 'pianist' and the film is simple and strong. Definately a 'must see'.",7,0,0,5 November 2002
Blade Runner," think about the future
","Ridley Scott seems to have made a classic movie. Very close to a masterpiece. In the not so distant future, man has lost control over his own product, the replicas. First he makes them perfect, now he has to restrict its potentialities to defect. Sometimes our own creation gets out of our control and what happens then?  Who is guilty and who is not? Is the manufacture or the manufacturer to be blamed for the loss of the original purpose of the existence created? What is allowed and what is not? Future is shown so cruel and poetical at the same time. Perhaps each one can find his personal answer in Batty's line: 'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.'",9,0,0,8 November 2002
Heat," wow! the best action
","Wow! What an action movie... Such suspense and tension, not to mention De niro and Pacino's acting. They are amazing. Nothing more and nothing less than themselves at their best: They are the sides of the same coin, placed one opposite the other,since each one is coping with his  life the way he knows. Very strong scene the one they meet and talk at the coffee shop, and then the hunting continues.. Also the big robbery scene.. Very 'Mannish' the way all the 'satellite' characters are presented as complete personalities, who's actions are affecting the main characters and vise versa.I shouldn't forget to mention the amazing scenery: the city, the jungle where the rivals are competing for their survival. Every single background of the city was amazing, characters are almost swallowed by it.Definately don't miss it.",8,0,0,20 February 2003
