The Blair Witch Project," Absolutely Awful Rubbish
","Firstly, I am a fan of horror movies and I have no problem in suspending my disbelief and being scared by a movie. Over the years I've let myself be scared by movies such as Hellraiser, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, The Haunting, House On Haunted Hill, The Changeling and many others.This film however was totally rubbish. Okay, so you don't see the Blair Witch in it? The horror was supposed to be implied rather than shown. I don't have a problem with that. I prefer horror moves where the unseen is more scary but Blair Witch was rubbish.The majority of the film was set in daylight and the characters stood swearing over their map. Any scenes that were set at night were rubbish. All you could hear was twigs snapping and leaves rustling. It didn't scare me and it didn't scare me when the young lady was sniffling at the end because she knew she was going to die. This movie was supposed to make people never want to go into the woods again. Well, as me and my girlfriend enjoy hiking, I can say that this movie did not put me off going into the woods unlike Jaws which put me off swimming for awhile. Nothing in this movie scared me. As for the camera work, the crew should have brought a tripod.Another thing was that this movie was filmed documentary style. This made it no scarier. If you want to watch a horror movie filmed documentary style that is scary then I suggest the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Cannibal Holocaust.All in all, this movie was extremely bad and not at all scary unless you find the sounds of twigs snapping scary. This film was rubbish.",1,2,4,11 September 2002
Gremlins," Ugly Bunch Of Creatures Causing Chaos
","Gremlins was a fantastic comedy film from 1984-the best year ever in my opinion for great movies.Basically, a guy called Billy Peltzer picks up a new pet called Gizmo and after breaking a few rules he shouldn't have, ends up spawning a bunch of ugly creatures called Gremlins who proceed to terrorize the town.The film is a success because it succeeds at producing both a comedy and a horror in one go which can't be easy. Most comedy horror films are a joke (such as some of the Ghoulies films which emulated the Gremlins series) but Gremlins is both funny and scary. It's funny seeing the Gremlins cause mischief but it's also scary throughout-they're not exactly pretty creatures and are quite scary as well.Gremlins deserves a look from anyone interested in seeing a good comedy horror movie.",Null,79,99,5 January 2003
Se7en," I Didn't Rate This Film Too Much
","Se7en isn't that bad of a film-I just think that sometimes with movies they can be hyped too much so that when you actually watch the finished product you can be quite disappointed.The main stars-Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt-certainly played intriguing characters but the film was just too heavy for me throughout. I do like this type of genre but the film seemed to move too slow for me and I wasn't that keen on the ending.With films like this you either love them or hate them. A lot of people seemed to like this film and in the interests of objectivity, I did watch it twice but on both occasions I felt unfulfilled.The producers deserve some credit for the effort they put into the movie-I certainly seem to be in the minority with regards to my opinion of this film. Most people seemed to love it.",Null,0,0,25 June 2002
Batman Returns," ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL
","Whilst I don't think any subsequent Batman film can ever hope to be better than the thrilling 1989 movie this is a decent enough sequel-and just as dark as the original.Michael Keaton returned as Batman and thrilled us all again (it was so sad that he didn't return to the role afterwards)as he battled the creepy looking Penguin and the beautiful Catwoman.The Penguin was okay in this film but he was a little bit freaky and to my knowledge, the comic book Penguin wasn't a freak (well,not a freak like this guy was). Michelle Pfeiffer made an excellent Catwoman. In my opinion she was exactly like the comic book Catwoman. Ever since this films debut in 1992 rumors persist that Michelle Pfeiffer will be appearing in a Catwoman movie. I hope that happens soon.Before this film came out I was quite disappointed when I heard Robin would not be appearing. However, looking back it was much better that Robin wasn't in either Batman or Batman Returns as it gave Keaton a chance to shine as the Caped Crusader. The original comic book Batman made his debut in 1939 and it was a long while before Robin came on the scene to brighten things up.This is a fantastic movie with some truly awesome action scenes.Batman fans will really enjoy this movie.",Null,0,0,5 March 2002
Blade," Wesley Snipes Kicks Butt In His Best Ever Role
","Let me first say that Wesley Snipes was born to play Blade the Vampire Hunter-nobody else could have done it. Snipes was 100 percent Blade.Before I watched this movie in 1998 my favourite Wesley Snipes film had been Passenger 57. However, after watching this I came away thinking this was Snipes best role.I mean, Blade is totally cool having all the strengths of a vampire but none of the weaknesses. And who can forget that sword of his that slices the hands of those who shouldn't be touching it?The fight scenes in this film were some of the best I have ever seen in a movie and again, it helps that Snipes makes it all so convincing.A lot of superhero films of the last few years have gotten a lot of good reviews but Blade seems to have been forgotten by most people-he deserves more. Blade is a brilliant action packed film not for the faint hearted. Check it out.",Null,0,1,16 June 2002
The Mummy," EXCITEMENT GALORE!
","Being a fan of old mummy movies I was quite disappointed at first when I heard that this film wasn't going to feature a guy in bandages. However, after seeing it I really enjoyed it.Firstly, any film with talent such as Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah,Arnold Vosloo and Patricia Velazquez is bound to be good. This film was great.There were no dull spots in this movie. There was no stop to the action and also, some of the scenes were really scary even for an adult like myself.This film reminded me of the awesome Indiana Jones movies from the 1980's. Films like this are always fun and this exceeded my expectations.All in all, a brilliant movie which at the time looked as though it could never be surpassed. But it was surpassed a couple of years later by the best film of 2001-The Mummy Returns!",Null,6,7,23 April 2002
The Others," Do Not Watch If You Have A Nervous Disposition
","The Others is the scariest film of 2001 and right up there with chilling films such as The Changeling, Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark, The Omen and The Sixth Sense.Nicole Kidman plays what I believe to be her best role ever as she plays Grace Stewart who lives in a large house with two young children. Her husband has been missing in action since the end of the second world war. Grace is a strict Christian who can't let her children leave the house because they have a rare condition which causes them to react fatally to sunlight. One day three servants show up to start work at the house after three other servants left unexpectedly. Then, the horror starts.The majority of the film is set in an eerie darkness where you never know what's hiding. I don't want to give anything away so I'll try to be vague. Grace believes there are intruders in the house and that is when the real horror starts. The film gives you a few clues (and a few red herrings) throughout and you are constantly wondering what the hell is going on? Is it all in the children's minds? Is the house haunted? Is there a more scientific explanation?The ending of the film is extremely chilling and totally surprising. When the movie ended I had to quickly turn on the light because it sent a cold shiver through me. It was very original but downright scary and it stuck with me for awhile.It's good to see that movies can still scare us without having a drop of blood shed. And this film reiterates the belief that horror that is implied and unseen is far scarier than guys in masks or rubber suits.",Null,0,0,15 September 2002
Home Alone," Fantastic Fun-Filled Film
","If you don't like Home Alone then you're either a robot or a zombie. Home Alone was one of the best comedies of 1990.Macauley Culkin plays Kevin McAllister who as the title suggests, is left home alone when his family goes on a trip. At first, he enjoys life as he gets the run of the house but soon starts to miss his family. Then things get worse as two bumbling burglars played by Daniel Sterns and Joe Pesci target his house...Although I was an adult when I watched this film, I could still see why Kevin McAllister appealed to kids around the world. What child hasn't wished they could spend some time alone in their house free to stay up and do what they want? There are some fun scenes throughout especially one when the pizza delivery man comes calling.The burglars are very well played by Daniel Sterns and Joe Pesci (both as clumsy as each other). At first, Kevin fools them making them believe he is not home alone but they soon become wise to his act and break in...that is when the fun starts as Kevin uses dozens of household items to fight them. Everything from irons (which he uses to hit their heads) to christmas decorations with sharp ends which Daniel Sterns steps on.It's hard not to thoroughly enjoy a film like this, especially as it appeals to all of us (adults and children) who have wished we could just have the house to ourself and do what we please. This is a great film which I thoroughly recommend and it was followed by two great sequels.",Null,5,7,17 November 2002
The Jungle Book," Brilliant Song, Brilliant Animals, Brilliant Film
","What can I say about The Jungle Book? It probably has the best songs of any Disney movie, it's full of wonderful animals such as Baloo the Bear and King Louie the ape and it has a great little character in Mowgli who was raised in the jungle (so I guess he's related to Tarzan).This is a great story throughout and the songs were just wonderful. When I first watched this film I couldn't get the songs out of my head and just kept humming them to myself time after time.There's plenty of creatures for fans of animals from snakes to elephants to a big bad tiger called Shere Khan (one of the best Disney villains ever).For those who haven't seen The Jungle Book, may I suggest viewing it as soon as possible?",Null,29,55,20 August 2002
X-Men," On A Scale Of 10, I Give It An 11
","The X-Men movie didn't live up to my expectations. No, it far succeeded them and we can thank this wonderful movie for giving the superhero genre a shot in the arm.This movie has been adapted extremely well for the big screen and the characters playing the parts are totally perfect. For example, Patrick Stewart IS Professor X and Hugh Jackman is totally Wolverine. And what can I say about Ian McKellan as Magneto?The costumes for the X-Men changed for this movie but I think when adapting superheroes to the big screen, it can be corny if you use the comic book costume. Black suited these characters far better.The storyline was very good as the good mutants battled the bad mutants to try and save a world which didn't care if every mutant on the planet died.
I think a lot of comic book characters can teach us a thing or two. The X-Men is about bigotry and in a way I guess it is asking us to put aside our prejudices and to look inside a person. The X-Men are distrusted and hated because they have been born different; the world forgets that they are unique human beings with feelings and emotions. They have an illogical hatred of the mutants simply because of how they were born.In a way, the X-Men is indicative of the world we live in where people kill each other on a daily basis simply because the other person has a different colour skin or follows a different faith. There are people out there who do judge other people on skin colour or religious faith and form an illogical hatred of said people without thinking that each person is different, that each person has their own dreams and ambitions and hopes and fears.This is what I believe the X-Men teaches us. But all things aside, the X-Men is an action packed movie that did well and gave the studios the green light to make more superhero movies.",Null,0,1,28 August 2002
The Terminator," Arnie's Best Role
","I believe that The Terminator is Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movie role (at least his best 1980's role).This was a wonderful movie. The plot was great-a ruthless killing machine from the future pursuing a young lady who may hold they key to the future of the human race. Fantastic.The Terminator was a great character and Arnie did a good job portraying an emotionless inhuman machine. The Terminator was great because it (not he) had only one purpose-to kill Sarah Connors no matter what. As one character remarked in the film it cannot be reasoned with and cannot be defeated-it has only one objective.Like most films of the 80's the action was top notch particularly the scene in the police station-that was an unforgettable scene.All in all, The Terminator was brilliant and it was followed by a brilliant sequel.",Null,0,0,22 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," THIRD FILM IN THE STAR WARS TRILOGY...AND THE BEST ONE TOO!
","Return of the Jedi was the third installment in the epic Star Wars saga and the best one too in my opinion.This film had it all-tragedy, action, romance and a bit of humour too. It did a good job of bringing the series to a close.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) All the scenes in this movie were great. I particularly enjoyed the beginning bits featuring Jabba the Hutt (truly the ugliest alien ever!)The scenes on Endor were probably the best parts of the movie. Credit must surely go to the special effects department for the scenes on Endor.The finale on the Death Star was just brilliant. The Emperor was one evil creature and it was great to see him get his comeuppance. The battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader was just awesome and it was just great to see Vader come to the aid of his son at the end and throw the Emperor to his death.Stars Wars was a great film. The Empire Strikes Back was even better. And Return of the Jedi was even better than the first two. I must have watched this film at least twenty times and each time I watch it I always enjoy it. The Star Wars saga really is one of the greatest sci-fi epics ever.I do hope C-3PO and R2-D2 get their own movie one day though!",Null,0,1,2 May 2002
Blade II," Incredibly Average Movie
","The original Blade film was awesome and I was expecting more of the same with this film but it was definitely disappointing.The film may have been heavy on special effects and loud music but the plot-whilst intriguing-was nevertheless very poor.On paper, Blade teaming with his hated foes to combat an even bigger threat looked good. But the film was poor. There was too much loud music, dark lights and far too much action. Now, I love action as much as the next person but every good film needs some dialogue and plot in between the action. Even the Bond films have quiet scenes in between all the action. Blade II gave me a headache.No-one-with the exception of Blade and the Whistler-were interesting. Even the villains of the film didn't turn out to be as formidable as I thought they would be. The villains had hardly any charisma and were very lightweight villains.Blade II was extremely disappointing and I hope Blade III will not be the same.",Null,1,2,18 November 2002
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Who Can Forget The Awesome T-1000?
","The original Terminator was a brilliant movie but the producers did the impossible task of creating an even better sequel.Again, the plot was great. Arnie was back this time on the side of good. When I first heard about this back in the early 90's I was rather disappointed that The Terminator would turn good but after I actually saw the film I was pleased. Arnie made a great good guy.Who can forget the unstoppable T-1000, an even more ruthless machine which can not be stopped by conventional means (as conventional as you can get when fighting machines from the future). The first half of the film dealt with the T-1000 (a great role for Robert Patrick) trying to locate John Connor. Then we got the even more exciting second half where Arnie tries his best to keep the T-1000 from killing John Connor. The battles during the end are just great.All in all, Terminator 2:Judgement Day was awesome and I am patiently awaiting the third installment.",Null,0,0,22 June 2002
Spider-Man," Go Spidey Go
","I saw this film whilst on holiday. Now I don't usually watch movies whilst on holiday preferring instead to lie on a beach somewhere but I was so anxious to see this film and it hadn't yet been released in the United Kingdom so I went into the cinema and watched a fantastic movie.Superhero films are a strange genre. Sometimes they are good such was the case with Superman or Batman. Other times they are plain bad. The success of a superhero film will often determine whether more are made. If a superhero film performs badly at the box office then movie studios are reluctant to make any more. However, if they do well then it gives a green light for more to be made.I was skeptical about Spider-Man to be honest. I wondered how two hours of film time could do justice to Parker's introduction, the origin of Spider-Man, the birth of the Green Goblin etc. The writers did a great job.Tobey Maguire was perfect as Spidey, exactly like the original character from Amazing Fantasy Comic no. 15 (1962). Kirsten Dunst was also perfect for the role of Mary Jane. And what can I say about J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson-he was spot on.Credit must go to William Defoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. I would go as far to say this is Defoe's best role in years. I actually felt sympathy for Norman Osborn as he had become a bad guy through fate rather than choice and Defoe made the Green Goblin into an interesting character. The Goblin suit was hi-tech as opposed to the costume from the comics; to be honest if the film would have made the Goblin suit exactly like the comics it would have looked rather corny.The action was just amazing; seeing Spidey leap around and the Goblin on his glider made me feel really excited. The fight scenes were great exactly as one would expect from Sam Raimi. Raimi was the man behind the fight scenes in Xena and Hercules so if you've watched them and enjoyed the fight scenes you'll love this movie.Well done to all those involved. I cannot wait until Spider-Man 2 hits our screens.",Null,0,0,9 June 2002
Die Hard 2," If You Loved The Original...
","...then you'll love this action packed sequel which gives you the fantastic Det. Lt. McClane back doing what he does best.If I remember rightly back in 1990 many people were criticizing this movie saying it was a clone of the original. So what? Most action films are. For example, if you sit down and watch the Bond movies you will notice most of them have the same plot, similar gadgets and beautiful girls but it doesn't take away from your enjoyment.Die Hard 2 is the same. Once again Bruce Willis plays a convincing hero who takes on the evil and morally corrupt bad guys in an action fest which fans of the original will enjoy.Oh yes, William Atherton is back too which is a good thing.All in all, another action packed fest which any serious action fan will enjoy.",Null,1,3,28 June 2002
Resident Evil," Best Zombie Film Since 1985's Day Of The Dead
","Day of the Dead was the last great zombie film in my opinion and that was released back in 1985. Since then, there have been several mediocre zombie films but this isn't one of them.Firstly, I haven't played the computer game at all so I cannot comment on how it relates to this movie. As a movie, it stands out on it's own.It mixes action and horror very well and the actors and actresses all play a good part. Usually in zombie movies the people battling the zombies have no personality but everyone in this movie does. The military type people make a great impact looking all trigger happy but you soon start to feel sorry for them and care for them as characters. At first you are not sure why some of the characters are there but it's great to see things unravel throughout the movie.This was the first movie in a long time where I kept jumping at certain scenes. I won't spoil those scenes for you but there are some really creepy scenes in this film. The zombies and other creatures in it are probably going to give me and my girlfriend a few sleepless nights because they were so scary.All in all, a pat on the back for those involved in this movie. It was very exciting and I shall probably have to go out now and hire a computer console in order to play the game so I can take part in the action myself.",Null,1,2,12 July 2002
Independence Day," Very Good Sci-Fi Movie
","Whilst I would not call this sci-fi film a classic it is certainly worth a serious look. It may not have been as big as the hype but it was a very good movie.Firstly, I would like to give credit to the actors and actresses particularly Bill Pullman and Will Smith who were very convincing in their roles and had some great dialogue.The special effects in the movie were awesome particularly the scenes where the aliens start blowing up the city and the end battle between Earth and the aliens who are real mean looking creatures.That's all I can think of to say for this movie as I don't want to give away any plot details. The film is worth checking out.",Null,10,23,24 June 2002
Days of Thunder," ACTION THROUGHOUT!
","Firstly, I've never been a fan of any type of car racing so initially this film didn't appeal to me. However, being a fan of Tom Cruise movies I just had to watch it.One again, Tom Cruise didn't disappoint. This film had everything it needed to be successful. The race track scenes were just amazing and despite not being a fan of racing it was really exciting to watch Cruise as Cole Trickle racing round the track at goodness knows how many miles per hour.The storyline itself was great as well. Cole was badly injured in an accident on the race track and the majority of the film was about him being able to overcome such a setback. In the film Michael Rooker as Rowdy Burns is also injured in a crash and it's great seeing him become friends with Cole Trickle. There's great dialogue throughout the movie and a fair bit of humour too.However, even if you don't like the story you will like the superb action scenes.",Null,1,2,5 May 2002
Ghostbusters," Greatest Movie Of 1984
","(SPOILERS THROUGHOUT)Ghostbusters was the best movie of 1984 bar none. It had a great cast, a great director and it was full of 80's humour.The Ghostbusters were scientists who went around trapping ghosts (for some reason New York had suffered an influx of hauntings)and they did it in style. The movie was funny throughout.Bill Murray played the sarcastic Peter Venkman who was sort of the leader of the team. He didn't take his work seriously and he was more interested in getting passionate with Dana Barrett played by Sigourney Weaver. The best scenes in this film were the ones where Venkman clashed with the bureaucratic Walter Peck (played by William Atherton) who was from the Environmental Protection Agency. Peck believed the Ghostbusters were a menace to the environment and Venkman really laid into him verbally.Dan Aykroyd played Ray Stantz who was certainly more serious in his work than Venkman. Stantz was probably more of a leader than Venkman.Harold Ramis played Egon Spengler who was the most scientific out of the lot-he was the one responsible for providing analysis during dangerous situations even when the team didn't need it.Ernie Hudson played Winston Zeddmore who wasn't a scientist. He had joined the Ghostbusters and been taken aback by the sights he had saw.The rest of the cast were great too such as Annie Potts who played Janine Melnitz and the ever dependable Rick Moranis.The scenes are truly great. There was the beginning scene in the library where the ghostbusters (before they actually became the ghostbusters)tried to catch a ghost with their bare hands. Then we saw them struck off from the university where they worked. There was the scene where they trapped a disgusting green ghost in a hotel. And who can forget the end scene where a giant marshmellow man nearly destroys the Ghostbusters? Amazing.I also loved the Ghostbusters car which was called Ecto-1. In fact I actually thought about painting my car in the same colours?That was a joke...I think.Seriously, Ghostbusters was the best film of 1984 and it was followed by an equally good sequel in 1989.",Null,0,0,8 June 2002
Back to the Future Part III," A Nice End To The Series
","From the beginning it was clear that there were only going to be three Back to the Future films with a beginning, middle and definite end. Twelve years after this film's release, it's nice to see that promise has been kept.I won't spoil the plot too much but Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd once again do a good job. Fox as Marty McFly travels back to 1885 to help out Doc Brown who is in a spot of bother.Just like the previous two films there are plenty of laughs and some truly great scenes (particularly the final scenes). My favourite scene was where McFly who is in the wild west tells everyone his name is Clint Eastwood and they all look at him in disbelief ('What type of a name is that?').All in all, this was a great end to a fantastic trilogy. I urge anyone to check it out.",Null,2,3,27 July 2002
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Bit Of A Chore To Sit Through But The Kids Will Love It
","I took my nephew and niece to see this film back in 1994 when it was released here in the United Kingdom. They were both 6 years old at the time and enjoyed it very much. I found it a bit of a chore.I do enjoy kids movies very much but The Nightmare Before Christmas fell below my expectations. The story premise is certainly very good and the animation is top notch. Kids will love the film throughout but after about 20 minutes of watching the film, I became a little bit bored. The animation techniques had surprised me and I thought they were brilliant but the film became too much of a chore for me to sit through.Kids however will enjoy the movie as it deals with the themes of Halloween and Christmas, two celebrations that kids love. And the animation will win them over. If you watch the film, most of your enjoyment will derive from seeing your kids enjoy it.",Null,4,9,26 October 2002
The Evil Dead," This Film Will Scare You
","The Evil Dead is a film that scared me. In fact, everyone I spoke to has been scared of this film.It really is a horrible film. You feel sorry for the characters in it. They are trapped in a cabin in the woods with some evil looking demons. The forest itself is alive and there is no way out. When I first watched this film I wanted the good guys to die because I felt sorry for them.This film is one of the great horrors like The Omen, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Nightmare on Elm Street. There are some truly creepy scenes in the film. The scariest scenes are where the girls are possessed by the demons. The other really scary scene is where the demon is in the cellar-I couldn't stop thinking about that scene.The best horror films are the ones where the characters are in hopeless situations with no easy way out. The Evil Dead is one of those films. It really is creepy. Make sure you watch this film during daylight hours. Those with a nervous disposition should avoid.",Null,103,165,17 May 2002
The Mummy Returns," THIS FILM GAVE ME HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
","This movie was so action packed and awesome that I felt like my blood pressure was going to go through the roof.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Just like The Mummy, we were treated to a non stop ride of action, comedy and a bit of tragedy. The scenes in this movie were brilliant. My favourites were the bus ride chase, the living waterfall scene, the little pygmies attacking everyone and of course, the finale where Rick fought the Scorpion King and Imhoptep. And who can forget the scene where Ardeth Bay and his men prepare to fight to the death against an army of millions.The really great thing about this film is that it is so unrealistic. I liked the way that flying ship manages to outrun water. That was really funny. And the good guys in this film could certainly beat Indiana Jones when it comes to overcoming the odds.This film was the best film of 2001 in my opinion and no movie fan should miss it.",Null,0,1,23 April 2002
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," New York City-The Perfect Place For A Kid To Have Fun
","If I was a young child and wanted to get lost somewhere, then the Big Apple would be my first choice. Yes, Macauley Culkin is back as Kevin McCallister who ends up getting split up from his parents and finds himself lost in New York.Just like in the first film, Kevin has fun at first booking himself into a hotel (you'll find out how a young kid cons a room in the hotel) and has some fun. There's just one snag-Joe Pesci and Daniel Sterns are back as Harry and Marv and once again, young Kevin must outwit them.The plot is pretty similar to Home Alone but don't let that put you off-it just means you've got more of the same thrills and fun to enjoy. Despite being lost in the city that never sleeps, Kevin again manages to find ways to outwit the relentless burglars who take countless bumps and bruises, many of which would have killed them but that's the fun of movies.Yes, Home Alone 2 was a fantastic follow up to Home Alone and it was followed by the equally excellent Home Alone 3.",Null,13,23,18 November 2002
A Clockwork Orange," Food For Thought
","When I first saw this film at the cinema I came out feeling I'd got my money's worth. Not only had I been entertained but A Clockwork Orange had really given me a lot to think about.I am reluctant to give away too many details about this film. I am sure that a lot of people know the basic story but watch for yourself and you will be watching a cinematic masterpiece. It is very violent at times and very disturbing and I wouldn't recommend it as a film to watch if you're going on a date.(SPOILERS AHEAD)It is a film that really makes you think. Malcom McDowell plays perhaps one of his best parts as Alex, the leader of a psychotic gang who go round committing heinous acts such as sexual assault, murder and violence. In the middle of the film Alex is sent to prison and is subjected to a radical new treatment which rids him of any violent or sexual urges. He leaves prison and finds he cannot integrate into the world he left. He also feels sick whenever he tries to engage in any violent or sexual acts.This is one of those rare films that can be enjoyed by viewers but can also give them something to think about. When Alex leaves prison he cannot do what he wants.The treatment he endured in prison has robbed him of one very important thing-freedom. Violence and sexual assault may be wrong and cannot be justified but I think this film is saying that in life people should have the freedom to do what they want-even if it is bad. If a person cannot do what they want-however bad it may be-then really they are not a person. Their humanity is gone and they are reduced to the level of a robot in society. I guess the film is saying that true freedom is being able to choose what you do in life-no matter whether it is good,bad or indifferent.That was my interpretation when I saw the film many years ago. I don't usually analyze a film in the way I have for this movie but it certainly is an intriguing movie. Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,22 May 2002
Groundhog Day," Superb Comedy With A Good Message
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***Groundhog Day is a superb comedy film for two reasons-firstly it is totally funny and makes good use of it's stars; secondly, it has a good message for us all.Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a weatherman who heads out to Pennsylvania to cover the start of spring (Groundhog Day). Despite the absolute absurdity of it,the same day keeps repeating over and over again but only Phil seems to notice it.I am unaware of how many times the same day starts over and over-I would guess thirty days plus. This sets up some funny situations. One scene(s) is where Phil keeps bumping into a tramp. The first time, he ignores him and the second time, he ignores him but eventually he ends up giving the tramp a large chunk of dough. Another funny scene involves an old friend and a puddle.You would think that watching the same day repeat would be boring but it is not because the fun is in seeing Phil learn from his mistakes whilst having a good old time. It's also fun seeing Phil's relationship with Rita (played by Andie MacDowell) played over and over again.As the same day keeps repeating itself, Phil gradually changes. At the beginning of the film he is pompous and arrogant but by being forced to repeat the same day, he gradually becomes more sensitive and caring. Therein lies the message. Obviously, in the real world we cannot repeat the same day over and over but wish we could because we could change things. I can think of several days where I wish I could have started again and changed things. I guess this film is telling us to be aware of the consequences of our actions and to treat people the right way. If we could repeat certain days, I am sure we could but we can't so we must try and get things right the first time round.A lovely movie with a lovely message.",Null,4,7,1 December 2002
Pulp Fiction," Words Simply Cannot Do Justice To This Film
","Pulp Fiction is one of those films where I simply cannot put into words how great it is. The script is brilliant, the film is great despite being near 150 minutes and EVERY actor/actress plays a great part.I did find the film confusing the first time I saw it but after I had watched it everything made sense.Every character in the film has depth. Take John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. They're not just playing a pair of emotionless hitmen like most films portray. They're real people with real feelings and real emotions. The same goes for Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace, Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace and Harvey Keitel as The Wolf. They are without a doubt the best characters ever in a film and I cannot praise them-and Quentin Tarantino-enough. As for Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge, well I think this is the best ever role for the underrated Bruce Willis who is such an interesting character.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) The scenes are great throughout. One scene I enjoyed was where Butch Coolidge and Marsellus Wallace are at the mercy of a homosexual pawn shop owner and his twisted friend Zed (and some freak called the Gimp). It was a bit of an uneasy scene to watch but the reason I enjoyed it was because Butch Coolidge came back to save Marsellus Wallace who was at the mercy of homosexual rapist Zed. Moments earlier Butch and Marsellus had been enemies but Butch rushed back and probably saved Marsellus's life. I found that quite interesting. In my opinion it showed us that there may be honour even among thieves.Of course, there are many other great scenes too numerous to mention. Pulp Fiction opens with a bang and finishes with a bang. Anybody who hasn't seen the film is strongly advised by me to get the video or DVD as soon as possible.Brilliant masterpiece! Well done to all those involved in it!",Null,1,2,19 July 2002
Die Hard," Non-Stop Action Throughout
","To this day, the Die Hard trilogy remains my favourite action trilogy. It's the type of film where you can just sit back and watch tons of action, tons of shootings and tons of violence.Bruce Willis is fantastic as McClane who is one of the best action heroes of the 1980's (or indeed any other decade). He is a no-nonsense character who will take no prisoners to bring down the bad guys.The thing I like about these films is the way the hero always overcomes the most astronomical odds to defeat the wicked villains who usually have no redeeming features whatsoever and are usually pure evil.Action fans who have not seen this film should check it out.",Null,1,1,28 June 2002
Ice Age," BEAUTIFUL FILM
","Firstly, let me say that I haven't enjoyed most of the kids films that have come out these past few years. The last childrens film I actually enjoyed was Beauty and the Beast (1992 version). Since then I haven't been impressed. I thought to myself that it was my age and that adults such as myself can't enjoy a kids movie. Well, I enjoyed this movie very much indeed.The animation is beautiful and so is the colour. The story is moralistic and very well done. There's comedy, tragedy, action and adventure throughout. Everyone involved in the production of this film from the director to the artists and all the rest deserve a huge pat on the back and it would be nice if this film won an award.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) In this film a mammoth, a sloth and a saber-toothed tiger attempt to return a young infant to his tribe. Along the way they get up to all kind of strange things. At times, I was on the edge of the seat and I really felt myself caring for the characters-including the saber-toothed tiger. This was a very moralistic cartoon and reminded me of the beautiful Land Before Time series of films. The characters were all great. The sloth was annoying but likeable at the same time (you always find characters like him in a film like this). The mammoth was my favourite. He was the leader in a sense and whilst he too was annoyed by the sloth and the tiger he nevertheless cared for them both. The tiger was a great character as well. His motives for returning the boy to his tribe were different to the sloths and the mammoths motives. What were his motives I hear you ask? Well, see the film and you will find out.There was one recurring character that had me laughing at times. Some kind of creature (I guess it was some kind of rodent) was trying to find a place to bury his acorn. This set up all kinds of comic situations-particularly one at the end of the film.All in all this was a terrific film to watch and for the first time in ages I came out of the cinema feeling that my money was well spent.",Null,0,0,24 March 2002
Army of Darkness," Why Even Bother?
","First off, I would like to say that I thought Evil Dead was a really scary horror movie which deserves a spot in any horror fans top ten list. Evil Dead II was also pretty good, although a little ridiculous. The third installment was just no good.Comedy and horror do not mix. They do on occasion but not when they start of as horror and descend into comedy. I have seen this happen countless times with other films. Freddy Krueger started life as a fearsome boogeyman but his later films resembled black comedy. The same happened with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Childs Play films. Evil Dead was an extremely creepy movie where you were waiting for something to jump out whilst Army of Darkness was too much of a comedy.I can live with Ash being transported back in time. However, this was far too comedic. It's perfect if you haven't seen the first two films but if your pants were scared off watching Evil Dead I and II then this film is totally unsuitable for you.Horror needs to remain horror. Could you imagine if the likes of Michael Myers, Jason Voorhess or Pinhead turned into comedy characters? Army of Darkness was disappointing and if the rumours about a fourth Evil Dead movie are true, I hope it is better-and much much scarier-than this one.",Null,2,3,9 January 2003
Scream 2," Nothing Special But Not Too Bad!
","The original Scream movie is the best in my opinion. When Scream came out it was a shot in the arm for the horror genre which was slowly dying a painful death. Scream 2 was not the most memorable film but it had it's moments.It's one of those films where you don't know the identity of the killer who slashes his/her way through loads of victims. Everyone is a suspect in this film. No-one is above suspicion. And just like the original Scream there are plenty of red herrings along the way.Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette and Liev Schreiber reprise their roles from the original film. Could one of them be the killer? Could it be someone who wasn't in the original film? Is it a man? Is it a woman? You'll have to buy the film and see.I must admit that I didn't correctly guess the identity of the killer but then again I've never been good at solving mysteries.",Null,1,2,17 May 2002
Die Hard with a Vengeance," The Best Installment In The Die Hard Trilogy
","Die Hard:With A Vengeance deserves to be ranked in a top ten list of action movies. The first two Die Hard movies were brilliant but this installment just blows the first two out of the water.Bruce Willis is back as police officer Lt. John McClane and in this movie he teams with Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus Carver to stop the wicked Jeremy Irons who is planning to cause mayhem and destruction around New York.If you're a fan of non-stop action movies like Speed, then this is the movie with you. It doesn't let up for a second; it's one of those movies where your heart beats as fast as the characters and by the end of the movie, you'll be feeling like you ran round New York chasing a bomber. That is how all good action movies should be.I don't think it is any exaggeration to say that Die Hard:With A Vengeance deserves to be rated one of the top action movies of the 1990's. All that has to be done now is to make Die Hard 4 which I hope would top this movie...although that would be quite a feat.",Null,79,124,8 January 2003
Scream," Well Done Wes Craven
","Wes Craven is the master of horror in my opinion. Scream was the best horror movie in a long while. Before Scream came out horror fans had been starved of any great horror films.The idea may not be original but it didn't matter; Wes Craven made a good film in Scream. Most people will know the plot. It was great and there was plenty of gore throughout. The best part was trying to guess the identity of the killer. There were so many suspects both male and female and plenty of red herrings throughout the film.The casting for this movie was spot on. Neve Campbell was brilliant as Sidney Prescott and I particularly enjoyed Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers. Credit must also go to David Arquette, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard. This was a great film but unfortunately it spawned a host of imitators none of which could hold a candle to this film (although I Know What You Did Last Summer and it's sequel were very good). I doubt whether anyone who watches this film will correctly guess the identity of the killer.",Null,0,0,17 May 2002
Halloween," Michael Myers Is One Of The Best Villains Ever
","Twenty four years after Halloween came out I still find myself spooked by it whenever I watch it.Most people are aware of the plot-a young boy by the name of Michael Myers kills his sister and is sent to an asylum. He escapes at the age of 21 and returns to his original stomping ground on Halloween night to kill.For the first half of the film we don't see any blood-the horror is very atmospheric and Michael Myers seems to be hiding in the shadows accompanied by that eerie music. Myers is one of the scariest villains ever-he is totally inhuman and is pure evil. Once we arrive at Halloween night the film gets even better as Michael goes on a murderous rampage. Only one man can stop him-Dr. Loomis-the man who treated Michael for years. Loomis is played by the late Donald Pleasence and it is a good part for Pleasence. Throughout the film Loomis comments on the psychology of Michael Myers-he describes Michael as having no soul and someone that should be locked up permanently.Also,who can forget Jamie Lee Curtis in one of her finest roles even to this day. Later sequels would suffer without her absence.All in all, this is a truly creepy film that has stood the test of time today and is much better than a lot of horror junk being churned out by studio's today. Watch it-it will scare you!",Null,0,2,27 May 2002
Back to the Future Part II," Is This What The Future Will Look Like?
","Firstly, let me say that no-one should watch this film unless they have seen the first one. If you do you just won't understand it-I remember a friend of mine watching this film once without watching the original and he couldn't figure it out.In the original, Marty McFly end up in 1955 and set off a sequence of events that threatened his existence. Of course he got back to 1985 at the end of the film.In this movie he travels to 2015 with Doc Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd in a role worthy of an award). I won't spoil the plot but let's just say that he's off to perform a routine task in 2015 but one thing after another happens and just like in the original, the 'fabric of time is threatened' (Doc's words, not mine-I'm no scientist). So Doc and Marty have to race through time putting things right and having a hard time doing it.Just like the first, there is plenty of humour and action and all the cast are playing their roles great; they look like they're really enjoying themselves.When I first watched this film in 1989 I thought the vision of the future in 2015 was quite cool-it was just how I'd imagine the future to be. Cars that can fly. Flying skateboards. Cool clothes. I hope 2015 is like this.",Null,1,2,4 June 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," Sorry But I Didn't Enjoy The Film
","I first watched this film in 1992 and I have watched it on two occasions since. I like to be objective but Silence of the Lambs does not appeal to me.No doubt, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins did a great job playing their respective roles but I found the film quite slow throughout. There were some okay scenes where Clarice Starling meets Hannibal Lecter and the end scenes aren't too bad but overall, I found the film mediocre.Perhaps the reason I didn't enjoy the film so much was because I had read the book previously and in most cases a film cannot compare to a book.It can probably be enjoyed by those who haven't read the book first.",Null,0,2,25 June 2002
X2: X-Men United," After Watching This, Roll On X-Men 3
","Absolutely happy! That is the only word I can use to describe my feelings after spending my hard-earned money to see X-Men 2. It was worth every penny.Firstly, the makers of superhero films such as this have an unenviable task. They have to please hardcore comic fans and casual movie fans which is no easy task. And The X-Men-with their forty years of history and continuity-are perhaps the hardest heroes to put on the big screen. Well, I've spoken to many hardcore X-fans and casual movie fans and they all enjoyed it too.I won't go into great detail about the plot. Let's just say that The X-Men and their enemy Magneto have to join forces to combat an even bigger threat. I enjoyed this movie so much because for the first time in years, I didn't read ANYTHING about the plot or any reviews prior to viewing it. That is why I'm not going to go into great detail about the plot. Just enjoy it.All the favourites are back including my personal favourite Hugh Jackman as Wolverine (I hope Wolverine gets his own movie franchise one day). The makers of this movie have done a great job in making sure various characters get the right amount of screen time. We'd all love our favourites to get more screentime but with so many X-Men (and women), the producers have to do the best they can; and they do indeed.There are a few really great special effects in this movie but unlike some special effects laden movies, the plot is more important in this movie. Furthermore, the movie is much deeper and really makes you think. Marvel comics (and movies) have always been deep and many of the issues have reflected real life. This movie is about persecution and intolerance of mutants and reflects many issues from the past and the present such as Hitler's treatment of the Jews and the different ideologies of Martin Luthor King and Malcom X. In fact, many longtime X-fans have compared the X-Men's Professor X to Martin Luthor King and the evil Magneto to Malcom X. Seeing a movie like this cannot only provide a couple of hours of entertainment but make you view society in a totally different way.This is the best superhero film since the 70's (when we saw gems such as Superman The Movie) and the 80's (when we saw Tim Burton's Batman). It was a fantastic film but it begs one question-how are they ever going to top this?",Null,106,122,5 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," Truly Thrilling
","The Sixth Sense had quite a lot of hype before it was released in 1999. The hype was very well deserved.When I watched this film in early 2000, it was the first film in a while that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. When young Cole Sear (excellently payed by Haley Joel Osmont)starts seeing the spirits of dead people it really gets at your nerves and as the mystery unravels throughout the film it get's more and more eerie.Those who haven't seen the film have probably heard that it has a twist ending but I won't spoil it for you. Let's just say that the mystery isn't that hard to figure out if you watch carefully but it still scares you at the end.This was,in my opinion, Bruce Willis's best role in years and he really did a good job. The Sixth Sense is brilliant and far better than that overrated and totally rubbish Blair Witch Project (also from 1999).I strongly recommend this movie-let me warn you though that if you watch it alone be prepared for a sleepless night.",Null,0,0,15 June 2002
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Freddy Gave Me Nightmares
","(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Despite being an adult when I viewed this movie, it scared the hell out of me and gave me a few sleepless nights.The concept of this movie was brilliant-a maniacal killer back from the dead to haunt your dreams. Freddy Krueggar was evil personified and he was the ugliest horror villain ever having a face resembling an overcooked pizza.Robert Englund excels as Freddy Krueggar. It was hard to believe that Englund played the mild mannered Willie in 'V:The Mini-Series' because in this film he was pure evil. Heather Langenkamp also did a great job as Nancy who was doing her best to stay awake to save her life. John Saxon and Ronee Blakely also played good roles.The beginning of this film is truly creepy where one of Nancy's friends is butchered when Freddy gets into her dreams and kills her. How do you defeat a being who exists in your dreams and can not be killed by conventional means? You simply stay awake. However, staying awake can also lead to death eventually so you're pretty much stumped.The ending is very creepy too. Nancy defeats Freddy (I won't say how) but the final scene is really scary as you realise Freddy is one dude who won't be staying down.I happen to think this was a very symbolic movie telling us that dreams are only dreams and can cause you no harm if you don't let them. It's when you do let them cause you harm that the danger starts.But, philosophical thinking aside, A Nightmare On Elm Street is a classic horror of the 80's and praise must go to Wes Craven and also to Freddy who carved his own niche.",Null,0,0,20 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Greatest Sci-Fi Epic Of All Time
","I have one word to say about this movie-wow! Twenty five years since it was released and it can still thrill an audience. Star Wars is great!I'm not overstating things when I say that Star Wars is truly an epic just like the age old stories of King Arthur and Excalibur. An epic has to have everything-action, adventure, romance, intrigue, deception, betrayal, the lot.The characters in Star Wars are the greatest characters ever invented for a sci-fi epic. Who can forget the likes of Han Solo and his friend Chewbacca the wookie? What about those two droids C-3PO and R2-D2? What about Darth Vader-a being who became evil purely through circumstances?I am afraid that words simply cannot do justice to Star Wars. I actually think Star Wars was ahead of it's time-back in 1977 we were not ready for such an epic. It blew our minds. We simply could not comprehend the sheer adventure nor could we foresee the impact Star Wars would have. Even today in 2002 there are fans talking about Star Wars and attending conventions the world over.If there are any youngsters out there who have not seen Star Wars then I recommend they stop whatever they are doing, head to the nearest video store and buy-not rent-but buy Star Wars and be whisked away to another galaxy for an epic adventure.Truly amazing!",Null,0,0,8 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Epic Adventure Continues
","Return of the Jedi is my favourite Star Wars film. The Empire Strikes Back is my second favourite and Star Wars is my third favourite although they are all brilliant films.The Empire Strikes Back is the second in the original Star Wars trilogy and once again the action is brilliant. The characters from the original all returned and we were treated to new worlds, new villains and new situations. Luke Skywalker was becoming stronger, Darth Vader was becoming more powerful and C-3PO and R2-D2 were as bumbling as ever.Who can forget the scenes on Cloud City or the battle between Skywalker and Vader. Also, who can forget the epic revelation (WARNING:MAJOR SPOILER FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM)-Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father! That revelation blew me away when I first watched this movie-how could an evil being like Vader be Luke's father?As I said in my Star Wars review words simply cannot do justice to the Star Wars trilogy. The Star Wars trilogy is timeless-if these films had been released today they would still have the same impact.Truly breathtaking.",Null,0,1,8 June 2002
Back to the Future," Time Travel Movies Are Always Brilliant
","Time travel movies never disappoint-that is because the concept of time travel is a very interesting one which most people must have thought about at one time or another. What would happen if you went back in time and an innocuous act changed the course of history for better or worse? It's something to think about.I won't reveal any plot details for this movie because it will spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Let's just say that Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ends up back in 1955 where a sequence of events inadvertently orchestrated by Marty threaten his very existence. He is aided by Doc Brown played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd who tries to get him back to 1985 without causing any damage to the fabric of time.The movie is great-and I feel it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their individual tastes in film genres. In fact, I find it hard to believe anyone could dislike a film like this. It has action, adventure, plenty of humour and some cool moments. All the actors involved in the movie play their parts great.Anyone who watches this movie will love it.",Null,126,159,4 June 2002
Goodfellas," BEST GANGSTER FILM EVER
","What can I say about this classic gangster movie? It has everything-realistic and interesting characters, plenty of violence, plenty of comedy-it truly is great.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Every character in this film is superb. It would take me a whole book to praise the characters in the film. They were all superb. Joe Pesci as Tommy De Vito was an absolute psycho in this film. The characters really had to watch what they said around him. The slightest most innocuous comment heard by De Vito sent him into a rage and he would stab, shoot and kill anyone who crossed him.This is the best part ever played by Joe Pesci in my opinion.Robert De Niro as James Conway was great too. Whilst he could not be classed as a psycho he was rather scary and unpredictable at times. When things kicked off, he was mean and nasty.Every scene in this movie is great so it would be hard to recommend individual scenes. I liked the scene where young Henry Hill got into trouble for not attending school. The school had sent a letter to Henry's father and his father had given him a beating. So you know what happened next? Henry's gangster friends grab the postman, rough him up and warn him not to deliver any more school letters to Henry's house. This was just one of many great scenes in this movie.I won't give any more away but let's just say that if you're a movie fan then you must watch this before you watch anything else.",Null,0,0,22 March 2002
Beetlejuice," Tim Burton's Best Piece Of Work
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSBeetlejuice is Tim Burton's finest piece of work. This is a film that can be enjoyed time and time again. The cast are great and the gags are great too. And who can forget Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice? Michael is a great actor equally adept at playing serious or comedy roles. I believe this is one of his best roles.Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play Adam and Barbara, a couple who die in an accident but return to their home as ghosts. However, a bunch of people move into their house and lets just say they're not the type of people I'd want to live with. Soon, Adam and Barbara end up recruiting Beetlejuice to get rid of the owners. But soon after, Adam and Barbara realise that Beetlejuice is more trouble than he's worth and that's when the fun starts.I don't want to give too much away about the humour in this film but it was hilarious. Michael Keaton always seems to enjoy himself in his movies and he was enjoying himself here. Beetlejuice is the funniest looking creature I've ever seen in a film. Adam Baldwin and Geena Davis do a brilliant job as do the beautiful Winona Ryder and Catherine O' Hara along with Glen Shadix.Beetlejuice is one of the best comedy films of the 80's and the final scene is just priceless. Check it out.",Null,0,1,26 October 2002
The Wizard of Oz," Fantasy Movies Are The Best
","Don't you just love fantasy movies? The real world is a dark and grim place at times so isn't it wonderful to switch on the TV and be transported away to a magical fantasy land with all manner of strange and interesting creatures? The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic and hardly any fantasy film can claim to be as great as it.I have always been interested in fantasy-as a child, I just loved it. Good always triumphed over evil and the fantasy genre was always very moralistic.The story is beautiful as the late Judy Garland plays Dorothy who travels to the land of Oz and meets up with characters such as the Lion and the Scarecrow to have plenty of adventures and to battle the forces of evil.This is a lovely film which can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age or movie preferences. It is a timeless classic and one which I would recommend to anyone.Simply beautiful.",Null,1,2,25 June 2002
Evil Dead II," Would Have Worked Better Without Humor
","Evil Dead 2 wasn't a bad film. I just think it would have worked better without the humor.The first Evil Dead movie was a truly frightening film. There was no humor in sight. It was a film that made the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.Evil Dead 2 was a comedy. In my opinion comedy and horror don't mix that well. How can you expect to be scared by a film when you know that a laugh is just around the corner? The Evil Dead didn't take itself too seriously and it just got crazier as it went on. The final scene was just a bit too crazy for me.Evil Dead 2 can probably be enjoyed by comedy fans or those who have not watched the original. However, fans of the original who are expecting to be scared probably will be disappointed.",Null,2,4,17 May 2002
