Antz," Impressive animation from Dreamworks
","The first of the Dreamworks animated production has proven a potential threat to the Disney's reign in animation.  The storyline is simple yet filled with a number of funny dialogues and scenes.  The animation is definitely impressive (10 times better than Disney's Toy Story).  Although short in its 75 minutes running time, it is definitely entertaining to both adults and children.",8,0,0,3 November 1998
