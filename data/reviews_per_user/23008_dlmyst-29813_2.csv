Hereditary," disappointment
","The first hour of this movie I was bored to tears but I told myself this must be one of those slow burn movies. Hell at the start the mom's letter basically tells you what's going to happen in the movie. A little cliche but I went with it but oh man was I bored. I'm half asleep right now typing this review because that's what this movie did to me, put me to sleep! The mom going crazy was okay but it was done way better in The Shinning. The ending of this movie left a lot and I wish they would of elaborated a bit more. I mean I spent over 2 hours wasting my life watching the movie. The least they can do is have the 'bad guy' eyes glow or speak at the end.",3,0,0,2 May 2020
A Quiet Place," Felt like a new take on horror.
",The movie from start to finish was a masterpiece. The way the parents and the children survived shows how far a human will adapt. The monsters in the movie looked pretty scary and I wish they show more of them. Probably in part 2 they'll give them more screen time. The little girl being deaf and her take on what's happening gave this movie a new twist. Would recommend this movie to anyone.,9,0,1,13 January 2020
