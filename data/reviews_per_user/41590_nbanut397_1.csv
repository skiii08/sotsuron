The Longest Yard," Fabulous Movie!
","This is such a great movie! The best comedy I've seen in a long time. All those Will Ferrel, David Spade, and Vince Vaughn movies were awful in comparison. I DON'T CARE if Adam Sandler is a diminutive actor, quarterbacks don't have to be as big as Warren Sapp. Brett Favre is 6'2'. No-one questions his football ability. The other common complaint is that the star cameos detract from the movie, quite the opposite, because the stars did a great job. Nelly, Stone Cold, and Goldberg all had acting parts that they could handle. The movie is stupid and I like it that way. I don't want to laugh at an intelligent film. I take all-honors courses, but I certainly don't need any jokes about the decline of the Roman Empire. I want physical comedy, well written jokes, and Chris Rock's racial comedy. SEE THIS MOVIE. And as for all the haters of this movie, if you want to see an awful comedy, watch Envy, which not even Christopher Walken could save.",10,1,3,2 June 2005
