The Hangover," Succeeds Where Old School Fails
","After much anticipation, The Hangover has finally hit theaters. Todd Phillips returns raunchier than ever with a surprisingly consistent comedy loaded with bizarre situations ensued by lots of laughter. From a live tiger in the bathroom to an abandoned baby in the closet, this movie has everything. Seriously, everything (confirmed by the credit sequence).Phillips does not shy away from his formula. The movie centers around four immature adults dumbfounded by the seemingly unexplainable result of a wild Vegas night catalyzed by the foursome's out of control bachelor party. Set the day before one of the principle character's wedding, the film is primarily seen through eyes of Doug (the groom-to-be), Alan (the lovable moron), Stu (the hopeless one), and Phil (the stud, and in many ways the leader of the pack). The director of Old School does not shy away from shock humor but embraces it, while gradually building confidence and self discovery within the characters. Overall, the film triumphs through curiosity and chemistry. Just like the main characters, we are eager to find out what happens, or what DID happen. At the same time, the strong relationship developed by the characters makes the viewer realize how much he/she cares about what ultimately happens to them. Chemistry is the secret to a good comedy; it is about time somebody shows this understanding.I don't want to reveal too much, but let me tell you this: everything does get explained in the end (except for the chicken aimlessly walking around in the hotel room, but I mean, it's a chicken). All of the actors succeeded in their roles admirably, and I wouldn't be surprised to see these guys in more lead roles. Ed Helms hasn't made me laugh this hard since The Daily Show. Seriously guys. Go watch this movie, you won't be disappointed.",10,250,458,5 June 2009
Pulp Fiction," Best of '90s.
","Pulp Fiction is a 3 story movie about crime, betrayal, and karma. Directed by the famous and clever Quentin Tarrantino, the film contains memorable phrases and a well developed script, also written by Tarrantino. The movie has brilliant ideas, and is filled with symbolism. While most of the symbolism is subtle, there are a couple instances where it is discussed, even by the actors in the actual movie. The motion picture contains an all star cast, with a wide variety of acting styles. This is a film for any person, no matter what their movie preference is. What completes the movie, is the fact that any movie watcher will consider the film for days, years, it even could stick with them for the rest of their lives.",10,1,3,13 August 2005
Fantastic Four," Spider-man and X-men meet...
","And create a retarded baby. This whole movie had generic written all over it. The characters were lame, there was no real chemistry between the characters, and the plot was predictable. When comparing this movie to the comics, the style is portrayed accurately. But honestly, is that a good thing? Daredevil, as demonic as it was, at least had a different darker edge to it. Fantastic Four was just as you'd expect it to be, another generic superhero movie.. Sin City, although the mood evoked was accurate to the comics, had creativity, and that goes a long way. Also, I don't think it was a coincidence that the three characters that did NOT turn into a monster all looked like supermodels. Again, quite predictable. This movie will only appeal to those with weak minds. Oh, and Ioan Gruffudd, I liked you in Hornblower. Thats where you belong, thats where your talent is truly expressed.",3,2,4,22 September 2006
