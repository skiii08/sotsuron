Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," No way
","Alright. I'll be dating myself, but who cares? Anyone who grew up with the original Star Wars movies (Episodes IV through VI) will likely notice how horribly this movie was written, directed, even conceived. I hate this movie with a passion and refuse to watch Episodes II and III for that reason. If there is ever a movie I was relieved NOT to have seen in a theater at $15 a ticket, it's this one. The acting was pathetic. The casting was irritating. The characters were poorly conceived. The cinematography was distracting and the CGI went overboard. Jar Jar Binks has to be one of the most irritating characters to ever grace the Silver Screen. I don't know if I've written anything that might be considered a 'spoiler' since this movie can't be spoiled any more than it already is. Use your time more constructively. Make paper airplanes with your kids or friends and see whose can fly furthest. Go to the kitchen and count toothpicks. Read a book by Anne Rice or J. K. Rowling. Pick the lint from your clothes dryer lint screen with tweezers. Anything you can do would be better than subjecting yourself to this movie. I normally would say the screenwriter should be dragged out into the street and shot, but I do still have a certain respect for George Lucas. Anyone who can get a movie company to make Episode II and III after this junk-fest is a genius. I may hate the movie, but you gotta admire someone who can crap a script like this and have it labeled 'gold'.",1,0,2,28 January 2007
50 First Dates," sweet
","Adam Sandler fans, fall in love with him again. Fans of 'The Wedding Singer' will adore this one. Adam Sandler plays a young man who is quite adored by the ladies who go on vacation to where he lives. Did I mention he lives in Hawaii?? The number of women charmed by Sandler's character is quite impressive. But -- what if -- his friend, Ula, asks, he actually has a lady who wants to stay and with whom he wants to stay? (Yeah, right. Like that could happen!) Well... Henry Roth meets a mysterious, beautiful young woman at a diner (Spam, anyone??) and his life will never be the same! Be wary of letting kids watch this one. Some sexual themes which aren't meant for young ears/eyes. I loved the casting. Ever-present in Sandler films, Rob Scheider delivers a good performance as Ula, a native Hawaiian with a large wife and lots of kids. He is dysfunctional as a parent (well, as a person, actually), but he offers comic relief that is worth a belly laugh. The chemistry that was in 'The Wedding Singer' between Barrymore and Sandler is also here. How can I describe the performance that is my favorite, though?? Sean Astin (Yes, THAT Sean Astin) plays Barrymore's brother, Doug. He also is delightful in his role and I just laugh each time I think of the things his character says and does. This movie is fun, sentimental, and semi-dramatic. Enjoy it with a loved one and lots of pop corn!",8,0,0,6 November 2006
Unbreakable," good plot, characterization
","I didn't enjoy this movie as much the first time as I did the second time. There are parts that are difficult to catch unless you are a really good observer. I enjoyed the plot a lot. You've got a guy who survives a train wreck -- the only survivor. He seeks answers as to why. You get to follow along, questioning as he questions. Why did he survive? Is there something special about him, or was he just lucky? And who is this guy who approaches him and tries to explain to the main character what HE thinks happened? Is he a kook or can you accept that he might be right? I enjoyed every twist and turn; every new revelation taking you to a new level of thought. Very well written. I enjoyed Bruce Willis in the main role and Samuel L.Jackson was fabulous. The casting lacked a little in a couple roles,which is why only an 8 for this one. If you're not sure if you liked it the first time, watch it again. It's definitely worth a second look.",8,8,13,26 August 2006
Fight Club," this one got me!
","I don't get caught out by movies. I always know everything within the first 5-20 minutes of a movie. Well, not this time! I loved it for more than that. The acting was perfect. Who would have thought I'd actually like Brad Pitt in anything? (I'm a not-fan of Brad.) Edward Norton, oh, how wonderful you can be. The plot is well-conceived. The violence, although sometimes kind of gory, is well-presented. You'll think it is all real. How far-fetched, yet how believable! Men, fighting to realize their manhood. To take back their right as men to be aggressive. To be physical. To take out their frustrations on each other and yet come out of it friends. Women don't do that, but anyone who has seen playground fights between guys knows: once the violence is over, you're best buddies. Very well done!",10,0,2,21 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Well done
","Disney has a penchant for ruining sequels and follow-ups to movies. This is not one of those times. Disney doesn't always mess up. (That's a big surprise!) Dead Man's Chest deals with the search for Davy Jones and a missing key to a chest, but no one knows what key or what chest. I enjoyed the characterizations and the casting was impeccable. Cinematography and special effects are very much on par with the first Pirates of the Caribbean. You must see the first one before you see this one. Otherwise, all the references to the first movie will be over your head. Don't worry about that, though. The first one was great. Enjoy this one with your kids (might want to view it first for violence and some adult situations.) It was great to see the actors from the first movie repeat their performances in this one. I'm looking forward to the 3rd (and final?) Caribbean when it comes out in May 2007. Johnny Depp gives a stellar performance again! I hope they can carry this on to the final one.",9,1,5,7 January 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," boy, was I surprised!
","A movie based on a Disney ride. A movie based on a Disney ride. Hmm. Does it sound appealing?? No. But did I finally watch it?? OH, yeah! Loved the casting. Can we do something with what's-her-name's teeth, though? At parts, looks like she's trying to pout over the overbite. Not attractive. But Johhny Depp??? Incredible job as the Pirate who helps others only to help himself. ('Don't do anything stupid'...'like that...' *sigh*) I am looking forward to the sequel, but not seeing it in theaters... Cause I'm going to buy it straight-out. I know it will be worth it as long as Disney didn't drop the ball. I can't imagine Depp signing back on if they had. So, looking forward to it. This movie is a must-buy. The casting, acting, direction and cinematography/choreography were all almost flawless. The special effects were well-done. Disney's getting better at the CGIs. (Hooray.) You'll love it for the plot. It's safe to root for the underdog again. You'll love it for the characters. How sweet the attraction between the main characters. Great family movie. Pop a large bowl of popcorn, grab your drinks, and have fun. Much better than the ride at Disney. (I don't want to see the Hall of Presidents on screen, so please, Disney, draw the line before you go too far, but good job on this one.)",9,1,4,31 August 2006
Happy Gilmore," Great fun
","I'm an Adam Sandler fan. I'm also a mom. Sometimes, I want those things to be able to mix. This is one movie I was comfortable sharing with my 12-year-old son. (Parents, please watch this one before you let your kids see it if you are conservative!) He gets a kick out of watching Happy overreact to the things that happen to him in this flick. My son also knows not to take Adam Sandler movies seriously. That's one of the great things about him. He can enjoy a movie that isn't considered 'Oscar quality' and not put it down just for that reason. I found this movie hilarious and watch it often. Some of the cameos were cute. Check out a famous game show host golfing with Happy. The acting was a bit wooden, but game show hosts don't get their job for their acting talent. You'll recognize actors that Sandler casts in all of his movies. (And why not? Ron Howard does it, too!) The plot was cute. If you hate golfing, don't worry. This movie isn't all about golf. That's why it's called 'Happy Gilmore' instead of 'Golfing with Happy Gilmore'. I think Happy is the 'dark' side of all of us. Little holds him back from expressing his opinion when things aren't the way he thinks they should be. It's a great 'unwinding' movie. Had a bad day? Happy does the acting out for you. (If we all acted like Happy, this world would be a strange, violent place. But, since we aren't like Happy, we can live vicariously through him as we watch him do the things we only daydream about.) I watch this one when I just want to laugh. (It really is the best medicine!)",8,1,2,8 November 2006
The Bodyguard," it can't get any worse
","Hopefully, you won't be left in the dark about the ending of this one. Very predictable, poorly acted, poorly conceived. If this is meant to have suspense in it, I'll be surprised. That's the only surprise about this movie. Watch the first five minutes. You'll know the plot, the 'twists' and all. Then fall asleep like I did. Watch the last five minutes to confirm what you already know to be true. You'll have a great nap and know you solved a 'twisted' plot with no effort whatsoever. If you can handle watching old Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston's lack of chemistry which is supposed to be so much a part of her motivations (and his), try to watch it all the way through. Like I said, at least you'll get a good nap out of it.",1,10,20,21 August 2006
Glory," based on a true story
","This is the movie that everyone MUST see. It deals with the factual account of the formation of the first all-Black volunteer company in the Civil War. (The story is based on the letters of the commander of the all-Black unit to his loved ones.) Broderick plays a federal officer who leads the all-Black unit. He goes through clashes of conscience within himself and with other Northern officers. He is in a very dangerous position: not only because he is leading an 'inferior' company; but, because he leads a Black unit,the Confederacy won't take him prisoner if he is caught. He'll be executed ASAP. The Black unit includes famous actors Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman, who give Oscar-level performances. I will never forget the time that Washington's character is punished by his commander. This was the first time I became 'aware' of Denzel Washington and started following his career from this point on. Fabulous reenactments of battles. Great conflict among characters. Great characterization. If you only see one Civil War movie, this is the one to watch.",10,4,6,1 January 2007
The Italian Job," fantastic!
","Seth Green fans, if you haven't seen this yet, buy it. It's a great movie. Mark Wahlbert, et al...wonderful acting. The plot was fantastically conceived. The casting could not have been better. Who would have thought Mos Def would be so appealing as the explosives expert? Anyone who loved the A-Team in the 80s will flip over this. (If you didn't watch the A-Team in the 80s, I wouldn't try to see it now. It pales in comparison to the acting of today, and I'm actually embarrassed that I was a huge fan. Go, Murdock!) The role of the villain was so well-played! You will find yourself rooting for the protagonists as they go about their work. You'll wonder 'how is it possible to plan things so well that they just can't go wrong??' Then wonder, 'OK, what went wrong??' Oh, wait, things are still OK. No, wait...oh, OK; things are still good...hmmm. It will keep you guessing even as it reveals everything as it goes. Loved it. Bought it. And it was all done in such a way that I let my son see it. He's hooked! Very well done!",9,0,4,21 August 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Pretty Good
","You know, I never read the X-Men Comics by Marvel. I just can't handle all the pictures and narration being intermingled. I always miss out on part of the storyline or spend my time trying to find the darn thing. But, I did enjoy the animated series when I was younger and so went to see the first and second installments of the most recent X-Men movies at the theater. I enjoyed them very much and was told by several friends that the storyline wasn't quite perfect, but that the stories themselves were OK in their own right. I personally would likely hate the movies if I had read the comics with the fervor that so many have over the years. Luckily, I can say I enjoyed even this, the third installment in the series: likely to become more than a trilogy. Considering that Star Wars by George Lucas should have stopped at the first three (anyone who enjoyed the 4th, 5th and 6th in the series -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- and was a 'real' fan hated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd installments which surfaced so many years later. I never saw the 2nd or 3rd because the 1st was so horrible.) I'm hoping X-Men writers don't make the same mistake. Some of the CGI that was done was unsettling (they make Charles Xavier and Magneto look like their younger selves at the beginning of this one). And some of the CGI was very impressive. The storyline reminded me very much of the animated series, since -- of course -- The Phoenix was involved. I always had trouble understanding The Phoenix's heartfelt wish to die, since I didn't know all that was behind it. The movie does a very good job of helping the viewer understand what's going on behind the request for help. The cartoon just couldn't get that graphic, I guess. Make sure you watch the little video clips near the credits. Just watch until you get back to the DVD menu. You'll see why there will likely be a 4th movie. My guess is, they will wait for a decent screenplay and people contracting again with them. Money is at the root. Did the third movie do well enough in the box office to warrant a 4th being made? If they improve upon the 3rd, I hope they make it. If they pull a George Lucas, I hope someone will keep a 5th from surfacing.",8,0,2,28 January 2007
Hero," why this movie deserves a 10
","Choreography - excellent. Cinematography - excellent. Acting - excellent. Casting - (are you kidding??) fantastic! Plot -- WOW! Special Effects -- oh, so very good! Direction - how can the direction miss on this one? It hit a bull's eye. Own this movie. If you have ever liked action movies, this delivers a full wallop. If you have ever liked cinematography, get ready for an eye-full. I love this movie. I first saw it while my husband was viewing it at home. I caught the last hour, and I was mesmerized. Time stood still until the movie was over, then I wanted to see it all over and over again. I can't say enough good things about his movie. This movie has increased my estimation of action film actors and directors. I loved the twists, I loved the entire plot. Watch it once for the love of the movie, then watch it again to fully understand just how complicated it must have been to film this movie. I highly recommend the DVD. So much of the work is discussed. You'll be amazed at what lengths the directors and producers went to make this masterpiece. Perfection!",10,1,1,31 August 2006
Man on Fire," worth it
","This movie was worth watching. It lasts longer than 2 hours, one of the things that surprised me about this movie. I think the casting was excellent. The storyline was unexpected. I never saw many ads for this movie and only wanted to see it because I think Denzel Washington is one of the best actors in America today. I have always been disappointed that he had to win his Academy Award in Training Day. This movie makes up for it, and I think it redeems him as a good actor. (I think everyone will agree that Training Day was not his best effort as an actor.) This movie appears to be filmed entirely on location in Mexico City. Many views of the city are presented. You see the very affluent neighborhoods and the very poor neighborhoods. In Mexico, you are either in poverty or rich. There are very few in between, which is why so many make the trip across the border in hopes of a better life not just for themselves, but for their entire family. I think the characterizations were fabulous. I felt real empathy for the characters. The script was fantastic. A bit predictable. But, for me, there is no 'unpredictable'. Tony Scott directed the film. I think he did a great job getting great performances from the actors. Dakota Fanning was made for the role of the kidnapped girl. She presents herself as very intelligent and yet vulnerable. I think -- if she can keep herself from being exploited by her parents and from falling for the falsity of Hollywood like most child actors -- that she has a career ahead of her that is worth following. The action in the film was great. Who doesn't enjoy seeing vigilante justice? This is a 'what comes around goes around' film. If you like crime drama, action, good scripts and story lines, you should enjoy this flick. Keep the Kleenex handy if you are sentimental. Who wouldn't love Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning together? They were incredible on screen.",10,2,7,9 February 2007
The Waterboy," the reason it gets only a 7
","Great movie. I enjoyed the plot very much. The characterizations were very funny and well-done. Only problem with this movie was Henry Winkler. I felt he did not give a good performance. The more I watch the movie, however, the more I realize maybe it was the script itself or bad casting. The role, I felt, just didn't fit Henry Winkler. (I don't have any recommendations for who would fit the role, however.) My mother hated this movie. The Waterboy is what some people call 'slow'. She is a teacher and couldn't stand to see what appeared to be a very stupid man as the star of the movie. (Yep, she hated Forrest Gump, too...) I, however, enjoyed his ignorant innocence. Naivete, if you will. I highly recommend that moms show this movie to their daughters. Any mom who acts like Kathy Bates's character, RUN. My ex-mother-in-law really loved the mom in this movie. (Hence the 'ex'.) Overbearing moms are a sure sign that something is wrong with your man. Great life lesson in an Adam Sandler film: I like it! Some parts were corny. But I can deal with corny. My dad's from Ohio. I was raised with corny. I recommend this one to people who like Adam Sandler, who like Kathy Bates, or who have ever been 'the underdog'. Great with popcorn. Great with friends. Watch it before your kids see it, though. Adult themes. Have fun!",7,0,2,8 November 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," a classic
","Monty Python, famous British acting troupe, does good. If you like irreverent humor, The Flying Circus series, or any of the single actors, you will LOVE this movie. We own it. There was no question of whether to buy it. We have the DVD collection which has quite a bit of the movie's history included. We enjoy the extras almost as much as the movie itself. The plot was hilarious, the comic timing incredible, and the direction stunningly fabulous. My son (12) loves the movie. We skip over a certain part, where Sir Galahad has his little adventure, for my son. Other than that, it's pretty 'clean' as far as Monty Python goes. Go over the list of actors and you'll see just how low-budget this film was. And for all that, it still is an incredible movie. If you like this one, check out The Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life. (Make sure you read the summaries first. These are more irreverent to my way of thinking and my son has not seen them yet.) Buy the movie. Pop some popcorn, sit in the dark with your loved ones, and laugh your head off. What a fabulous movie!",10,1,2,23 September 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Not recommended for viewing with your kids
","Some movies which have high ratings of PG-13 and R are acceptable to watch with your kids if you have good communication between you: parents likely are best at knowing what their individual kids can handle seeing. This movie is not for the faint of heart. The humor is quite low-brow. Anyone with 'gay' issues will not want to see this one. The Formula One driver who invades NASCAR in order to be 'defeated' by someone worthy is quite gay. Anyone who has issues with irreverent humor will also have trouble with this one. The reason I'm giving this movie a 7 instead of a LOWER score is the script really is well done. Will Ferrell does a great job playing a redneck, white trash (I'm Southern, so don't get your hackles up if you're offended by this description) NASCAR driver. I love the attitude that comes across when Ricky Bobby and his family spout their philosophies on love, dating, racing, religion, family and friendship. I guarantee I've been unlucky enough to be around people just like Ricky Bobby and his family. Whoever wrote the script has to have been in the South a lot. Very insightful, even if it does make rednecks look bad. (What redneck needs help with that?) Anyhow, laugh-out-loud funny, but definitely not something you'd want to watch with your kids. Unless, of course, you espouse the philosophies so freely given by Ricky Bobby and his crowd. Shake and Bake, buddy!",7,0,2,28 January 2007
