National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Brilliant
","Two thumbs up. I liked the first one and this one was even better since we had already been introduced to the characters. I like the national treasure movies since they are smart, and actually make you think and maybe even come to the conclusion that history is not that boring. Even while being an action/adventure movie they fit in some good humor. Everything in this movie is well thought off. Also the fact that you never know whats happening next right,you know they'll find the treasure but you don't know how,when and where. Nicholas Cage plays his part very well so does his girl friend and Riley. This movie is one that you can never get disappointed by ,and will always keep you in the edge of your seats.",10,1,11,24 December 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Awesome
","This movie exceeded expectations.the plot,script and animation were great.the only fact was that they don't give characters like Mr Burns,krusty,smithers,patty,selma,melhouse,apu,chief wiggum and the bullies enough lines.but anyways it was hilarious especially in the beginning Bart is writing on the chalk board 'You will not download this movie illiegly'.adding greenday was a good touch.Even the spider-pig and harry plopper jokes are really.funny.grand theft walrus on the other hand wasn't that funny This movie really deserves to be on IMDb's top 250 list.over all this was a great movie.just don't let kids under 12 watch it.i give this movie 4.5 stars out of 5.",10,2,5,2 August 2007
