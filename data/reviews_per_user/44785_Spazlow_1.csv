Miracle," Exciting, moving and totally worthwhile
","I caught a sneak peak of Miracle on January 31st and I'll be the first to say that I was disappointed to not be older.  I wasn't born when these games took place, but I sure wish I was.  I've always seen the classic run onto the ice and the gloves flying up in the air, but it was touching to see it in full color on the big screen and with Al Michaels announcing the plays as they were performed in 1980.  Russell makes an excellent coach, always hard on the players and trying to put the team first before himself, like the true Herb Brooks.  The worst part were the articles of clothing fashioned by Russell in the movie (red plaid pants and a yelow and blue plaid jacket), but we can't blame the filmmakers for that.  That was Herb Brooks' fault, no offense.  A+ rating from me!!  I'm going to see it again when it's released nationwide on the fifth.",Null,0,0,2 February 2004
