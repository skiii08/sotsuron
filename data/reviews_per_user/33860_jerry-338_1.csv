The Longest Yard," Another re-murdered movie.
","Hollywood method : Take original classic. Take out plot, character or any complexity. Infuse with product placement. Spoon feed to consumer.Shame really.I watched it to see how close they would stick to the original while cramming in product placements and cameos to stick with the continuing cut'n'paste format.They have done that fairly well.Yea another discredit to the US film industry.Another nail in the coffin of respect for an original, probably the worst tribute since Luc Besson's Taxi was taken to the slaughter house.",3,1,3,3 August 2005
