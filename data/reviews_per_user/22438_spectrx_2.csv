Skyfall," Didn't live up to the hype
","It took me a while to watch even Casino Royale, because I was annoyed they got rid of Pierce Brosnan. I finally watched Daniel Craig's movies and warmed up to him. I was excited about Skyfall because it was getting such crazy press, reviews, and success.On the surface, it was a very solid movie. However, the entertainment comes at the cost of huge plot holes and contrived ideas. MI6 are portrayed as complete idiots and buffoons, and the main villain is smarter than all of them put together and is nearly omnipotent. Similar to the Joker in The Dark Knight.If you can get passed the fact that the scenario involving the main villain couldn't possibly have happened, then you'll enjoy the movie. Unfortunately, every step of the way, the story is propelled by more plot holes and nonsense.",6,11,24,22 June 2013
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Gratuitous, boring, and pointless.
","I love the Harry Potter universe, books, movies, etc. But this movie was utterly gratuitous, pointless, and boring. It has no redeeming value of it's own, relying solely on being a 'Harry Potter' movie, and having good special effects. 45 minutes into the movie, I was only barely starting to see what the point of the movie might be, and still couldn't have cared less about any of the characters. This is an absolutely by the numbers movie, with no heart or soul to it, and is a disgrace to the Potter universe, in my opinion. If you're a kid, you'll probably like it, but an adult, not so much.",4,0,0,4 February 2019
