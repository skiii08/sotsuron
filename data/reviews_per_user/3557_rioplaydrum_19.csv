Blade Runner 2049," Over Baked
","I waited for a while to go see BR2049 because I didn't want to stand in line with the un-washed hordes.I am a big fan of the original, and I had high expectations that just weren't met. There are glaring differences between the two.First of all the original had a plot line that was easy to follow and moved along at a good clip.The sequel does nothing of the sort. While I admit every scene is masterfully crafted and the sound track excellent, the film is so over packed with minutia I frequently could not follow what was going on.It was fun seeing Deckard again, but his role seemed odd and pointless. That being Deckard is now a paranoid hermit and why Agent K would seek him out at all made no sense to me.And the biggest problem as I see it, the film is TOO LONG. The production is just 16 minutes short of three hours! Who has the patience for that? I ended up walking out early and missed the ending. At some point I grew incredibly restless and bored and could take no more.A fine production but one I think most people will not have attention span to tolerate.",6,3,5,5 December 2017
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Hideous
",The stupidest movie ever made. Looks more stupid every year.,1,3,20,1 June 2018
World War Z," Useless and pointless
","I really wanted to see this movie. I really like sci-fi zombies, and I've always liked Brad Pitt. So what went wrong? This movie is a train wreck.The first ten minutes was pretty good, but after that? I read months ago there was several problems getting this product into the can, as they used to say, and the result is glaringly obvious.No plot. No character development. No consistency. No continuity. Brad Pitt's talents totally wasted as he mumbles and stumbles through scene after scene.I was left shaking my head about every ten minutes. The movie itself is a total mystery. It gives the viewer lots to watch from a CGI perspective, but doesn't bother to intrigue you with any kind of a story.Truly and totally disappointing.",2,2,5,30 July 2013
Passengers," Somewhat Disappointing
","My expectations were just too high with this otherwise terrific presentation.Pros: Visually stunning. The CGI and spaceship design gets high fives all around. Truly a remarkable achievement here. I was in awe of the visual presentation and the enormous amount of thought that must have gone into this work.Great acting. Both main characters deliver a performance with an emotional range that is very believable. How would you handle yourself all alone on a gigantic ship irreversibly hurling through space? You'll find the answers here for sure.Cons: Fishburne's character seems mildly odd and out of place in the story. I find it too remarkable a coincidence a high-ranking crew member would accidentally be woken up just in time to provide much needed help as far as gaining access to secured areas of the ship. This derailed the plot for me a great deal.Bad science. When you are a confirmed Sci-Fi fan, you have to get used to things like that. But there are some truly glaring anomalies here. The ship is supposed to be traveling at 93,000 miles a second, or half the speed of light. That's 335 MILLION miles an hour. You are not going to be able to view a passing star with such magnificent grandeur, but again the CGI is overwhelmingly good, so it's forgivable. Unsatisfying ending. Too quick and convenient. I would have loved to know far more about how the main characters lived out the rest of their lives rather than the little bit that was shown. It simply left too many questions unanswered.Overall, not a waste of money or time, but 'Passengers' falls far short of making true cinematic history and will not be considered a classic in the sci-fi genera.Oh, well.",6,4,9,1 January 2017
"I, Tonya"," Not A Dull Moment In The House
","We have now come full circle with the life and times of the one and only Tonya Harding.I very much remember the actual footage and news stories and relentless pursuit of her movements.Tonya the champion. Tonya the conniving participant in evil deeds. Tonya the celebrity joke. Tonya the hated. The first half of the movie very efficiently converts the hard-scrabble world of Tonyas' daily beat-downs from a hell bent mother, well meaning but idiot husband, and a small collection of his single-digit I.Q. associates into palpable comedy.We actually receive guilt free laughs as Tonya and her husband Jeff pound on one another, delivering blood and bruises while shoving each other's heads through walls and shattering mirrors.The formula works, considering a lot of it probably did happen. Before this, I had no idea how deep her red-neck roots went.Imagine the Bundys from the old 'Married with Children' TV show except with genuine violence, alcohol abuse, and firearms... you get the idea.The second half delves into mostly tangible drama as Tonya's world is permanently unraveled by bumbling, delusional fools who fancy themselves real live black-ops agents and 'cleaners'.As the buffoonery and drama fades into the end credits featuring footage of the real Tonya at work on the ice, your heart strings will be tugged on more than a little bit in hopes the once brief American Legend has found peace.And a big fat check in the mail.",8,2,3,4 February 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," If You're My Age, You Will Cry
","Aside from the one obvious monster number one hit of the same name, I was never a big fan of Queen, but it doesn't matter. Yes, I knew Freddy could be a 'highly difficult' person. Yes, I knew he could be a highly flamboyant gay character and that he died of AIDS.What I never really knew was the band's story and Freddy's heroic but tragic end.I couldn't help it, but while watching I myself started to remember my own life and the things I was doing during the late 70's and 80's. Back then you probably couldn't go a couple weeks without that tune wafting in from somewhere. Even briefly from a passing car.This story will make you weep for the past.I flinched a bit at the Gay scenes like any straight male, but I found near zero anything wrong with this movie. Like usual I was a little worried the two hour run time would leave me bored and fiddling with my phone, but no. I was glued to the story from start to finish.I terrific movie and a striking salute to Freddy and the band.",8,4,6,4 November 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Creative Use Of CGI And a Story, Too
","I was skeptical. I'm no real fan of what I consider a tired Harry Potter franchise, but this was a surprise.This is a much more mature story line with a darker theme. Characters flow well with one another, and the cliché's are kept to a minimum.Very generous use of CGI, but it doesn't take away from a well devised plot with many twists and turns.No doubt your familiar with the plot from countless other reviews already, so I'll keep it nice and short.A great afternoon spent with the entire family and nothing too scary for young children.I enjoyed it immensely, and I highly recommend watching it in 3-D if you can.This film will be hanging around the box-office for a while!",8,3,7,20 November 2016
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Seriously?
","You can write all the phony 10 rated reviews you want, you ain't foolin' me or anybody else. Just like most folks, I waited over two hours after the film began for the film to begin.I was entertained by the absolute attention to detail as far as what you would experience walking around a 1969 Los Angeles, but that's all you get.We are treated to a series of meandering scenes that individually threaten to turn into a story, but then it doesn't happen. Over and over again.The only shred of a plot that develops at all is between Brad Pitt's character (can't even remember his name) and a quirky underage hippie girl who happens to be part of the Manson family.This anti-climaxes with an absolutely useless scene between Pitt and Veteran Bruce Dern, leaving the viewer yet again wondering why anybody would drop $12 on this pointless movie.And what's up with the revisionist history? Why would you want to change who gets murdered and why?Disappointing, fruitless and boring.You'd be more entertained following me around for three hours on any given day.",1,10,19,22 August 2019
Get Out," Super Good Creepy Fun
","While the movie dances around several racist cliché's, this film explores the possibilities of high-tech slavery involving very wealthy white families, hypnosis, and some rogue neuro surgery.Oh, and throw in the most devious and evil girlfriend on the planet.This story is well presented and flows at an enjoyable rate. Even though the main plot involves some pretty serious issues, there are plenty of very creepy moments as well as laughs to go along with the drama.Very unique and a keeper as far as spending the money for a first run viewing.Highly recommended, but maybe not for young children (seriously).",8,5,18,26 February 2017
A Quiet Place," Holy Cow. This Is The Face Of Classic Horror
","Back in 1979 when I was eighteen years old, me and a buddy went to the theater to see a just released and trending sci-fi thriller entitled 'Alien'.For years I always said that was the last film that really scared me.What a refreshing surprise to know somebody can still pump out a genuine nail-biter after all that time. 'A Quiet Place' is set sometime in the not-to-distant future where whole towns stand abandoned and there's only a smattering of human beings left. What decimated the human race? Was it a nuclear war? Natural disaster? Unless I missed something, the story doesn't give us a clue.What is left aside from a few humans are a species of absolutely terrifying predators that evidently can not see or smell, but hear. They literally have ears for eyes, and savagely hunt down and kill anything that makes so much as a peep.Where did they come from? Are they aliens? An experimental species that escaped from a top secret government lab?Again, we do not know. They can run on all fours with the speed of a cheetah, and can rip their prey apart with the strength of a silver-back gorilla. You do NOT want to tangle with any of these buggers.Trapped on a farm in an otherwise idyllic setting are a young family composed of Mom, Dad, and their three children. And a baby on the way.Dad is a smart man, educated in farming as well as electronic engineering. He toils tirelessly away at the soil and spends countless hours sending out distress messages from a short-wave radio desperately trying to find other survivors.Aside from that, they are 100% self-sufficient and want for nothing. One clumsy accident in the house leads to another, and in no time all the lovely critters start showing up for dinner.'A Quiet Place' had me squirming in my seat from start to finish. Extreme tension and bad surprises come fast and furious. Sheer terror is the order of the day.There is a plot-hole here and there and a bit of bad science, but you won't care, believe me.Many times I joke about a film being perhaps a little too intense for young children. This one is, and I'm not joking.Have fun, y'all!",9,3,5,6 May 2018
The Game," Depends on what you're into.
","I like this movie but I totally understand why many people were very frustrated with it.The ability to predict random events and keep driving The main character to a particular destination is absurd. Had it'd been me, I personally would have went utterly mad half way through.On the other hand, the situations and action are unique and superb.Great cast of characters and acting.Like most highly specialized, plots, It's not for everybody.",8,0,0,15 September 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Great If You Like Special Effects
","The story opens with a now one-dimensional Jack Sparrow lounging inside a bank vault loaded with gold and no explanation how he got there.Shortly after that, his band of merry-makers steal the entire building and drag it through the streets with a team of horses.Yeah.That's as good as it gets.Forget that they are able to secure the bank vault on a ship after somehow eluding authorities.Practically every transition from scene to scene in this movie is nearly impossible to follow and frustrating to watch, with a ridiculously stupid finale that made me think, 'Thank God it's over'.This production is the epitome of what a big-budget (1/4 of a BILLION dollars!) Greedywood movie that has every flashy thing under the sky and nothing of substance.There is no definable plot. There is no palpable pathos. There is no anticipation of anything to come. Just everybody's favorite drunk mumbling and bumbling about.The formula is now old and silly.Oh, but there was an amusing scene featuring a guillotine.",4,10,18,5 June 2017
Kelly's Heroes," Too long and dated
","Again, a movie I once loved as a boy has come back to bite me on the rear. I first saw KH on the big screen at a drive in when I was a little kid. Clint Eastwood! Carol O'Conner! What could go wrong? Now here I am in my middle age, sitting on the couch, sipping a whiskey and watching the flick yet again on TCM, and I don't even know why.The film from a tactical point is absurd. Were the German troops that stupid as to just run in front of the hero's' tommy guns at every available chance? Silly Germans! Triks are for kids! And no blood on any of the casualties on either side. Mighty squeaky clean bullets they used in WWII.Telly Savalis and Don Rickles animated rivalry in the film grew irritating and stayed over the top after the first half hour, and can we dissect Donald Sutherlands' character for a moment? The guy was a HIPPIE! Hippies in the forties? Hello? I don't remember hearing about any of those in WWII! This was obviously Hollywoods' way of trying to relate to the late sixties, the time period the film was being shot.And what about the end of the film? I don't think you could really get FOUR TONS of gold on the back of one truck... and how did they get it back out of the country? How did they fence it? Did they all hit the streets back in America with two hundred pounds of bullion stuffed in their nickers each??? I also didn't quite understand the spontaneous appearance of 200 French natives all celebrating their 'liberation' while a handful of Americans casually cart away sixteen million dollars in gold right under their noses after shooting up their town.This movie has lived on to display the dated, overpriced, underachieving crap it is today. Sorry about those negative waves! WOFF WOFF WOFF! That's my other dog imitation.",4,11,25,12 September 2009
Logan," A Wonderful Surprize
","I don't normally get a big kick out of Super Hero movies because they all just seem too impossible to morally invest in.I mean, don't these people ever do anything wrong? Logan, formally the Wolverine is now aging and can't get on top of the ball anymore. Fighting crime holds no appeal these days and would rather suck on booze and mindlessly drive a limo for God knows who.Enter Dafne Keen as Laura.What a treat. I can't think of many supporting actors at such a young age who can knock it out of the park as she does in this film. Totally believable and superb.Hugh Jackman also portrays a character with a butt-load of bite left in him to deliver substantial damage against all the right people before the curtain drops on his cursed existence.Well worth your time and money.Loved it!",8,2,6,7 March 2017
The Shape of Water," Bloody Weird
","G. Del Toro has been frequently fawned over as a 'masterful story teller'. I found nothing 'masterful' about it. I absolutely could not hook in to this film. It made no logistical sense at all. It also had a dark and cartoonish feel to it like a Bat Man film. The setting in which the story takes place is deeply flawed. Eliza (the dumb one), and Zelda (Octavia Spencer) work as cleaning ladies in a so-called top secret facility when there seems to be nothing top-secret about it.The cleaning pair wander at will throughout the facility and discover it's also 'top-secret' biological specimen with no clearance at all. Right.And low and behold, the biological specimen is none other than the Creature from the Black Lagoon! This time in living color and many upgrades.One might also notice Octavia Spencer is appearing in every other bomb out of Hollywood as a supporting actress and nothing more. Maybe in ten years they'll give her one of her own movies. Not holding my breath.Back to the Creature. We'll call him Creatch for short. The homely Eliza has a strict routine of hard boiling eggs while she masturbates furiously in her bathtub every morning. Eliza is fundamentally scared to death of normal men. She then brings the food to Creach, which she eventually falls in love with.Creach is super duper intelligent and can instantly learn English, American sign language and writing, but likes to savagely dine on the occasional domesticated cat here and there. Right.Creach also has super powers. He can almost instantly heal bodily wounds, as well as restore hair to a bald man. Alright, that one small bit I found pretty cool, but that's it. Eliza eventually decides to kidnap Creach, for his own good, so she can turn him loose into the ocean just one step ahead of Russian Agents who have infiltrated the facility for the soul purpose of killing him. Again, not a very top-secret organization.Shortly after that, Eliza and Creach begin having sex. That's right. An otherwise normal woman gets it on with a humanoid looking fish that looks like it dried out in the oven too long. Happens all the time I guess.The two subplots involving a sadistic head of security and an alcoholic neighbor who works as a graphics artist are barely even worth mentioning.And the ending? Beyond impossible.This story is strictly reserved for the over-emotional, over-romantic, and completely naÃ¯ve.Go see it if you really want to, but you have been warned.",3,480,943,18 December 2017
Kong: Skull Island," More Than I Expected
","I had it firm in my mind this was going to be a cartoonish fiasco similar to Peter Berg's sci-fi bomb 'Battleship' released in 2012 which was designed for teenage gamers and pretty much nobody else.'Kong' has far more sophistication than that. Instead of a comic book we get a well designed production more on the level of the graphic novel.Attention to period detail (1973) is nearly 100 percent, from wrist watches, military uniforms and weapons, tactical gear, radios, tape recorders, record players, cameras, aircraft, automobiles, scientific equipment, most of it checks out as authentic.The only thing I spotted as incorrect was a brief view of an animated color computer graphic that wouldn't have been possible for at least another twenty years, but that's all.The CGI goes without saying. The use of it to make the most disgusting creatures come to life is as good as it can get. Kong battles away with these many monsters with great dramatic flair. One is an eighty foot tall spider that really gave me the creeps. Anachriods are not my thing, and the movie didn't help me with that at all.As the story progresses, the military/science team meet up with a mute indigenous people who have lived on the island for thousands of years. Again, attention to detail is immaculate.You would have no problem believing this was an actual race completely cut off from the rest of the civilized world had you ever met them.However, there were a couple of unbelievable and ridiculous scenarios that threatened my suspension of dis-belief. First, there is no such thing as an island with it's own savage storm system that keeps it hidden and nearly impenetrable. If you have a scientific mind at all, you'll find this idea laughable.Second, the military blundering that occurs when the helicopter pilots first encounter the giant ape, which gets everybody stranded in the first place, is overwhelmingly dumb and hard to swallow.Instead of retreating, all the pilots simply fly mindlessly straight at Kong who bats them all out of the sky one by one. Duh.But it is an action movie, and that's what you get, regardless of the lack of logic or reason here and there.Great fun for all ages.Your teenage boys will love it. Your teenage girls will probably not.Oh, and Samuel Jackson doesn't drop a single F-bomb through the whole movie.I found that refreshing.",8,2,5,17 April 2017
Life," I'm Mixed On LIFE
","Not your typically directed sci-fi movie, or any movie for that matter.I was a little annoyed how quickly the film jumps straight to the unfolding plot with basically zero character development. There is no real lead actor accept for Jake Gyllenhaal, and just barely.While the camera work is innovative and presents believable scenes, I found the spinning and whirling techniques dizzying and over the top.But then something happens about twenty minutes in. The story becomes truly terrifying.'Calvin', the name originally given to their new pet from the planet Mars, awakes, grows, learns, and makes his prime directive known very quickly: Assimilate all available life forms and kill them.With each kill, Calvin grows bigger, faster and stronger. And he/she/it is one ugly bastard. Calvin looks like a cross between an octopus, dragonfly, and a man eating plant.After failing to burn Calvin to death, the remaining crew quickly assumes Calvin could probably survive re-entry to earth as their damaged space station suffers one calamity after another putting them into a decaying orbit.Many desperate decisions are then made that only prove to make the situation worse.Aside from the odd mix of basically one-dimensional characters and screw-ball camera work, I did find LIFE something of a genuine nail biter and would recommend it, but not for young children.Several of the scenes are very intense and I'm not sure you would want your eight-year-old watching it.Nightmarish stuff for sure.",6,24,48,10 April 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Fascinating
","I often wondered what a guy like Keanu Reeves might be doing in the future after The Matrix and a few other projects.Now we know. Holy cow. This film keeps you glued to your seat and slaps you upside the head and leaves you wanting more.The violence did get to me a little bit, because there's quite a bit of it. Our friend executes around 40 bad guys in this movie, and many of them close up with brains blowing all over the walls.The background visuals are stunning in this picture. The backdrops of Rome in particular left me somewhat breathless and a little distracted from the story, but no matter. They are truly beautiful and give a picture of how the genuinely rich really live.A totally loaded movie with a stunning visual landscape, but the extreme violence might be an overload for young children.Loved it.",8,3,8,16 March 2017
Alien: Covenant," Not Again
","This franchise has gone on way too long and should have stopped at installment number 3.What we get here with 'Covenant' is a cheap but elaborate re-hash of many elements of the first two movies. From the soundtrack to at least 7 or 8 key plot points are presented with near identical similarities.And somebody please explain to me HOW a bunch of summer-camp councilors passes for a crew in charge of the most expensive interstellar space craft in the history of the human race. Complete morons. So much so that you might think Mr. Scott is playing some kind of joke on us old foggies who were nothing short of enthralled with the original Alien released in 1979.I was 19 years old in 1979, and I am now 56.Yes, it's been that long.Also thrown in is a iconic line from Ridley's other master-creation, Blade Runner (and no, I'm not going to tell you what it is. If you're and old fart like me, you'll spot it immediately).While no fault can be had with the design and cinematography, the re-run mentality is getting old and worn out.If you are in your twenties and not that intimately familiar with the franchise that now dates back almost 40 years, you will probably be wildly entertained.If you're in the same age bracket as myself, you'll find it annoying.Like Star Wars, the Alien franchise has morphed into absolutely nothing that resembles the original, and leaves us wondering when the curtain is going to drop for the last time.It's over, Mr. Scott. You'd do far better letting people re-discover your past work rather than trying to reanimate it.But I am very much looking forward to Blade Runner 2049.See you then.",3,7,16,22 May 2017
