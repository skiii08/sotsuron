Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of my all time favorites
","This movie is the perfect 'fun' movie.  The plot, pacing, score, and everything else were very well done.  I don't think there is a single flaw in this tribute to classic cliff-hangers.  Kudos to Spielberg and Lucas. I just wish they made more of them like this one.  Enjoy!",10,0,0,10 May 2001
The Terminator," One of my favorites...
","I love almost every aspect of this movie.  The plot, the pacing, the score. This is still Arnold's best (of the ones that I have seen).  I would love to see this movie cleaned up in the same way Star Wars was.  Not that the effects were bad.  James and his crew did better that most with a low budget.  My favorite seen is when Kyle shoots the Terminator through the window of Tech-Noir and says to Sarah, 'Come with me if you want to live.' The look on her face is priceless.  A must see.",9,0,0,8 May 2001
The Matrix," Awesome
","Being a long time martial arts fan, I thought this movie was great!  The actors were all well cast (even Keanu).  The plot was phenomenal.  The special effects rocked!  This move redefined the genre!  I cannot wait to upgrade my home theater so that I can fully appreciate this movie (I dismissed it when it was in the theaters :( ).  I just hope that The Matrix is not tainted by the upcoming sequels :)",10,0,1,15 May 2001
