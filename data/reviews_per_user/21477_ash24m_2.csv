The Blair Witch Project," GENUINELY SCARY AND VERY ORIGINAL, A FUTURE CLASSIC!!!!
","I don't care what some people say, this movie to me is way scarier than the exorcist, Well i guess it all depends on what gets you scared, I remember walking along though a wooded path by my house when i was younger and i couldn't see my hand in front of my face and as i walked i would step on a dry leaf because it was fall at the time and a couple of seconds later the leaf would un crunch, It felt like someone was behind me the whole time, That is the kind of unknown fear that is a lot scarier than any special affect could ever conjure up . This movie really reminded me of that time and gave me the allusion that i was with them in those woods, I thought it was so original and really played with the audiences imagination and anyone who says it sucks is just trying to be cool. I'd recommend it to anyone who has a good imagination.",9,1,1,8 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Some of you people really don't get it do you
","You people who do not like this movie just don't get it. This was one the most Original and scary movies of all time. Any comparisons to Cannibal Holocaust or the last broadcast or any other movie that may be construed as similar are way out of line, this was so much more then those movies will ever be. It surely deserves to go down as one of the best Horror Movies of all time. You people really need to take a second look at this Masterpiece and appreciate it for what it is, a true classic. Use some imagination people!. The acting was excellent; any one of you would have acted like a bunch of screaming schoolgirls if you were in that situation and you know it. Some people say, 'Who would be scared of a pile of rocks. The answer is anyone who has been hungry and scared for days on end would have a heightened send or paranoia, and if you were already scared to begin with a pile of rocks outside your tent that wasn't there earlier would scare you, as someone had to have put it there. Alright I'm done talking just watch it again and I'm sure you will have more positive reaction to the film.",9,1,2,4 November 2002
