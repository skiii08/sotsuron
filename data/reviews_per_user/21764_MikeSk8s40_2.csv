The Ring," I didn't like this movie.
","I didn't like this movie and was mad that i spent money renting this at Blockbuster and I am also angry that I ordered pizza for this movie because I thought it would be really sweet. I'll explain why this movie wasn't good to me. THIS WILL SPOIL THE END OF THE MOVIE AS I WILL MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT THE ENDING!1. This movie was in no way scary to me. You see some dead face for .5 seconds in two different scenes throughout the entire movie. That is not nearly enough to scare me or even entertain me. Maybe if they had like their hearts ripped out or there body was taken apart and like their bodies were hanging from a wall.2. The lapses between the two so called 'death scenes'. Waiting the entire movie to kill off one character. That is simply ludacris. Maybe if you found some pictures or something in a cabin that showed the high school students who had died in the beginning.3. Aiden ,or whatever the boys name was, did some stupid stuff throughout the movie. 'I couldn't sleep!' What the hell kind of excuse is that. And why did he now so much about the girl.If I have some more time I might go over a few other details that annoyed me. I must say the ending was a little innovative but it seemed to make two mistakes. I would of enjoyed this movie more if after Naomi Watts and Noah (don't know actors name) the movie simply faded out and the credits began to roll. BUT, this didn't happen and the ending had Noah die and then they make a copy of the take and the movie ended. Well I think that the director should have went beyond that and had something more happen. I honestly have no idea what should of happened but there NEEDED to be something else to happen after that.Oh, yeah and the horse jumping off the boat was like the funniest thing I ever saw in my life. It was like just about to clear the railing and then it's back legs hit the railing and the horses face collides with the side of the boat. I was laughing for like three minutes!",1,4,12,5 June 2003
The Evil Dead," It's like a B-Grade Movie that did it's homework.
",This is definately my favorite horror movie ever. It seemed to make the classic cliches seem brand new. I could watch this movie two times every day for a week and then not watch it for a month and then watch it again and it'll be brand f**king new. This movie just has something about it that makes it so great. I enjoy the continuity flaws seen throughout the movie and when I get some money I am going to go buy the special edition so I can listen to Sam and Bruce discuss this greatly flawed movie.,10,1,3,5 June 2003
