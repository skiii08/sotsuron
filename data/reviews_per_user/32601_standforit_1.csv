The Devil's Advocate," Excellently done, not about morals.
","The Devil's Advocate is less about evil and more about maximization of opportunity. I really think the movie was excelently done, with the music setting an eerie tone - as if Pacino and the enigmatic Reeves need eerie music. Pacino's character, John Milton, capitaliazes, perhaps sometimes at the expense of others. That is what makes it a movie, fiction. The extremes are very extreme. The two ladies, Theron and Nielsen, are terrific in their roles as well. I do not see this picture as a morality tale, so don't expect to see that. Watch it for the enjoyment and listen very carefully, for there are many wonderful lines of dialogue in The Devil's Advocate.",8,1,2,2 October 2001
