The Ring," If only it meant something
","The Ring is interesting to watch and a visual work of art -- yes -- but it's also a terrible film and not scary or moving at all (for those of us, at least, that require more content the Blair Witch level of juvenile scares).
Usually when a film is loaded with plot holes it isn't because the filmmakers are smarter than us and we're somehow missing something, it's because the filmmakers are missing something themselves -- such as any real concept of what the hell they are trying to say or communicate to the audience. Lots of scary-looking images not a scary movie makes. Definitely a let down for pretentious film poseurs everywhere.",Null,0,2,10 May 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The best movie of all time!
","Like 'Star Wars' or 'E.T.', this film is sweeping in its epic scale. Every scene is pure gold. The special effects were the best of their time and REMAIN the BEST. This film is a life-altering experience, and I pity the poor saps that fail to appreciate it.",10,1,2,27 December 2001
Ocean's Eleven," What's with the negative reviews?
","Ocean's 11 is a superbly crafted comedic tour-de-force made to deliver a little thing called 'entertainment', and it delivers, big time. This is, in my opinion, the most entertaining and enjoyable film of the year. Unfortunately, there are people out there that find ways to nit pick about a film that couldn't have been made any better. Judge it for what it is! This film WORKS. What it does it does well. It's fun, the characters (except for Julia Roberts, of course) are fun, the plot is fun, the action is tight and brisk. This is a QUALITY production.",Null,0,1,27 December 2001
Lawrence of Arabia," Unpretentious, direct, sweeping story
","I watched this for the first time in widescreen. I found Alec Guinness distracting, as he is obviously not an Arab; and there is nary a word of Arabic spoken in the entire film beyond names and places. Omar Sharif may remind of you Wes Bently who starred in a similar epic, 'The Four Feathers'.
The film is more art than entertainment. It is long and a bit languid at times, but the photography is like nothing seen since, the score is beautiful (though a bit intrusive at times, as was the style for the era), the production is flawless (observe the city of Akahba).
The unpretentious, direct, sweeping story characterized the film for me.",Null,0,1,18 April 2003
JFK," LAYS DOWN THE FACTS
","This tour de force lays out in meticulous detail factual evidence proving a conspiracy behind the assassination -- It proves how Oswald could NOT have been the lone gunman, how Oswald could NOT have killed Kennedy, how dozens upon dozens of credible witnesses saw and heard numerous things pointing to others being involved, how sloppy the investigation was on all governmental levels, how the Warren Commission altered evidence, how evidence was destroyed, how a cover story had been prepared before the fact, how the Zapruder film proves Kennedy was killed by someone on the grassy knoll or in that vicinity, etc. If you want to find out who is either 1) a sympathizer for our lying government or 2) a complete moron, simply ask them about the JFK assassination and whether they think there is a conspiracy, and when they fail to respond in the affirmative, you'll have your answer on what kind of person you are dealing with. Sometimes no amount of factual evidence can open a closed, ignorant, fearful mind.",Null,0,11,15 July 2002
