Marie Antoinette," Excellent!
","I am not really a Sofia Coppola fan, but I did love her work in the Virgin Suicides ( I really couldn't care less for Lost in Translation), but her Marie Antoinette is an experience anyone who loves movies should endure. While on a vacation trip to France to visit a cousin, we decided to go see the film, since it had premiered at the Cannes Film Festival just three days before I got there. My cousin had told me that while the reviews over there had been ecstatic and raves, some of the french press booed at the press screening. To be honest, from that reaction, I immediately thought the movie was going to suck, but then I remembered whatever the critics hate, I end up loving, so I gave it a shot. This movie blew me away! I of course had found out before hand that this film has nothing to do with the revolution, or the beheading of the last king and queen of France. So I went in there with knowledge that I wasn't expecting a boring period BBC dramatization of Marie Antoinette. The film is glorious to look at! The costumes are simply the the greatest costumes ever constructed. We are used to seeing 18th century costumes with wild plooms, and explosive beading and diamonds every where adorned, but these costumes were much more simpler but had a dramatic effect to the eyes ( this is so winning best costumes at next years Oscars). The actors were tremendous particularly Dunst, who whenever I would read threads about Antoinette on here would be bashed because some people said that she cant act, or she could never pull off this role. Believe me, she does (if campaigned right, she could so get an Oscar nomination for this)! She excels as the doomed Queen of France in every way imaginable! She is a frightened teenager in the beginning of the film, trying to please everyone even her overbearing mother (played by the wonderful Marianne Faithful), and you automatically identify with her. Here is a girl who has no friends, no close companions, and while she tries to please her husband, he (jason Swarchtzman, great as always) just blows her off, because he feels that he is not the kind who likes to have sex! So she grows up in the palace of Versailles's, and gets her reputation as a bit of party girl who loves parties, clothes, jewelery, company of women (who wouldn't want that if at 19 become ruler of a powerful decadent country) till finally when she has her children you see her mature and become a loving mother, and a devoted wife. Sofia has made an excellent movie. Sure the script does lack a certain depth to some characters, but remember this isn't your mother's Marie Antoinette. This a new wave Marie Antoinette, and Sofia excels in her vision! But this film isn't for everybody. If you have a problem with rock music used in a period film then you may cringe at some of the moments when the songs are used. Also if you expect to see a full blown bio of the Queen, then you are dead wrong, because this film explores how one minute Antoinette was the toast of France, to the last where she finally accepts her fate as the last and doomed Queen of France. It is a very good movie. I highly recommend it.",10,99,199,5 June 2006
The Other Boleyn Girl," Good for its Genre of Soap Opera Epics.
","I just got back from a 12:00 screening. Of course it was just me my two friends and like five other people (it was the first showing after all) and all I can say is that I was pleasantly surprised. Ignore the reviews. This movie is ten times better than Memoirs of a Geisha and granted its a soap opera of a movie, its really a good one.Natatlie and Scarlett are surprisingly good. I mean a lot of the reviews were on the fence about both of them, but they pull it off, or they pull what they can with the accents. Portman is devilishly good as Anne. Yes this isn't a good representation about Anne (I prefer Anne of the Thousand Days, which historians and movie critics believe is probably the closest portrayal of the doomed Queen of a Thousand Days) but Peter Morgan did an excellent job in not fully adapting the book. The book made her out to be this delusional bitch who you really hate, but in the film he makes her a two dimensional character, which you hate one minute, and really, really love her the next. I am not going to give anything away, but what she goes through from both her Parents, her uncle, her sister, and of course henry and the court, its only fair in saying that the girl had the right to go a little crazy.Scarlett is Mary, and she is sweet, loving, and of course a two dimensional character like Portman's Anne. Its so strange because in the book, she is the main character while Anne gets the supporting role, but in this film both Girls share the title of Other Boleyn Girl equally until the third act which is the final act, where it is clear Mary will forever be known as the 'other.' Bana is pretty bland in some parts. He is given nothing to do but yell, laugh, seduce, yell some more, and of course go a little mad. Female audience's as well as Bana lovers on these forums, he does show a lot of skin, more than the ladies Jim Sturgess who plays the elder brother George Boleyn, Ana Torrent who plays Katherine of Aragon, and Kristin Scott Thomas who plays Elizabeth Boleyn the mother of Anne and Mary are all equally good in their supporting roles, especially Ms. Thomas who I am so happy is getting work. She is still beautiful and when I was watching her I could not stop thinking that she is Katherine Clifton from the English Patient. Sturgess is also a promising talent. He and the girls had great chemistry.the overall direction is way much better than The Golden Age. Yes okay the plot borderlines Age's soap opera, but Chadwick made Boleyn Girl a good soap opera. It is not over the top in technicals, its subtle textures, and gorgeous costumes from Sandy Powell are all excellent. The score is also subtle and haunting, nothing like the huge epic blasting in Golden Age.Overall I give it an 10 out 10. Its enjoyable, and the performances fit the roles. Portman and Scarjo have a lot of chemistry. It was nice to see them act alongside each other. I think if it had been released for Awards considerations I think costumes, score, and art direction would have been nominated, along with maybe cinematography (the countryside shots, as well as palace balls and banquets and Anne's coronation are beyond gorgeous to look at!) This film isn't supposed to be taken seriously. I mean look at the material it is based on. The film was made to be enjoyable whether you agree with the story or not. We all know that it is not real, but that is the point of making movies to tell stories we hadn't heard before. This film isn't a history lesson. Its more of a character study between two sisters who were forced by their family to be rivals.",10,8,19,29 February 2008
