Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The force of money is with you
",The film totally betrays the former trilogy.{1} The trailer never shows the child which is the main character of the film... a five years old boy who drives spaceships better than Schumacher drives formula one cars... {2} It is designed only to sell gadgets and videogames. How it is possible to make two (2!!) very long scenes in which a child drives very fast spaceships? It was like to be in front of an old videogame without having the console (what a fun!) {3} In the end it is just a pizzazz of not very special effects like a lot of other films that attempted to imitate the first trilogyThank you Lucas for showing us which is the real force of our society: marketing (aka money).,2,0,1,23 July 1999
Ali," Don't waste your time with it..
","As I did unfortunately. One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Not sure it's because of Will Smith's performance, although he did really act very poorly. He clearly showed the difference between looking like the Champ and being like the Champ, resembling those guys who desperately try to imitate Elvis... Awful.",1,11,22,28 June 2002
