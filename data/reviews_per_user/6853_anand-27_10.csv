Blade Runner 2049," Not a sharp Blade
","There has always been a debate among my friends about the original Blade Runner being way too linear and indulgent and that its cult status was earned on the back Rutger Hauer's closing lines, all that rain and the business hoodoo (save for Coke, all the companies that were up in neon lights went bust).There will be no debate among us over Blade Runner 2049. It has the original beat for being ridiculously indulgent by a mile. OH MY GOD, does every scene need to be that long and lingering that one could doze off and wake up to Ryan Gosling having taken maybe three steps forward in a scene? When a movie runs for as long as BR2049 does, it needs to give us something...at the very least someone to root for - the closest we come to is Harrison Ford's Deckard who is old and craggy and the barely there pulse of the movie (and even then we have to wait till the final 45 or so minutes). I like Ryan Gosling but he was wasted in this, as were the other cast members. Fanboys may prop this up but even die-hard fans will know deep down that this isn't as sharp as the trailers and hype would have you believe.",3,25,52,6 October 2017
The Irishman," Goodfellas for Geriatrics
","First things first. Scorsese was robbed off the Best Picture for Goodfellas in 1990. It was so good that it should be ranked alongside Godfather I and II as the Holy Trinity of mobster movies.That said, The Irishman is anything but. To be honest, it is very, very overrated.The story is a rehash of Goodfellas with the additional open-secret-about-Jimmy-Hoffa. It is slow, lumbering and most importantly, EVERYONE IS OLD and regardless of de-aging, they do not look convincing in their roles, nevermind credible. Pacino may come close with his over-the-top performance but that's just him in every movie since Scent of a Woman. Harvey Keitel looks distinguished from a distance maybe. But the rest. Seriously. People are raving about Ray Romano, de Niro etc Please. They hardly do anything that stands out. We don't even care if they live or die (same goes for almost everyone in the movie). There is no one to root for let alone feel for. Even the annoying Pesci dying in Goodfellas made us feel something. Even the Spider he shot.I get that The Irishman is a winter sonata by Scorsese. He doesn't have much tricks left and this was too big a payday for him and his closest buddies to pass up BUT save the 3 hours and rewatch Goodfellas from 1990. It was the last movie Scorsese pulled out all the stops for and gave us his guts and glory. It entertained and it made us feel and it made us yearn for the mobster lifestyle like some guilty pleasure.This Irishman is too drunk ad bloated on its own compliments that it deserves to sleep it off. Doesn't even deserve a courtesy Salut.",3,3,6,5 December 2019
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2 only half as fun as the first one
","There was a report that Hugh Jackman told Ryan Reynolds to 'back it up' - it might as well have been the summary of Deadpool 2. We know Ryan had waited a lifetime to play this role and he was genuinely fresh and funny in the original. Here, in DP2, his relentless yakking grows tiresome too fast and while there are some nice bits here and there, they are few and far between to make up for a show that just tries too hard with a ho-hum plot. Goes to show that only Disney-Marvel can make magic. I expect Ant Man & Wasp to kick DP2's ass. You have to watch it coz of how fun the first Deadpool was but you will quietly groan and not hurry back for a rewatch. Pity.",5,51,152,15 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor goes Tony Stark and does Deadpool
","Thor has always been a little too serious and self-important. And Disney-Marvel have decided enough is enough.Storyline, Blah. Baddie, Blah. Action sequences, Blah. Length, Groan. But it's FUNNN!! This should have been a summer flick coz it's pure popcorn fun.Hulk is a hoot but for me, Jeff GoldBlum steals the show.Go have a blast.",8,43,76,25 October 2017
Justice League," One good scene. After the movie.
","Are bots doing reviews these days? One has to wonder when you see the avalanche of 9s/10s for Justice League.It's an okay movie at best but a 8/9/10 is just rigged or retarded.The good news about Justice League is that the DC guys are finally getting it. Tone down on the darn stuff and lighten things up.The bad news is the characters are still far from being fleshed out to make us really care. (We felt sad when even Loki got stabbed and he is a baddie!) Every scene Affleck's Batman is in feels like he just apologised for groping that reporter - he is so out of it. Wonder Woman is one-dimensional and does more posing than acting. Aquaman was never interesting as a comic book so poor Jason Momoa has to dial up the boozy BS to give him some 'character'. Cyborg...yawn. And the CGI...it is just terrible given the state of technology these days. Come on guys, you pinched Joss Whedon, go get the Disney contacts for CGI! Tha Flash and Superman are the two savings graces in Justice League. And their showdown scene is everything DC can build on - humanity with a light touch that we all want to see more of.",5,4,6,19 November 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Take a Bow, Avengers & Russo Brothers!
",They couldn't give every hero equal billing (they tried with Antman & Captain Marvel which is the minus one star) so they made the movie all about the original Avengers from 2012 and...the movie does not disappoint. Couple of 'wow' moments with a generous sprinkling of sweet tender moments throughout. The best finale anyone can ask for and a fitting curtain call for the original Avengers. Kudos and a big THANK YOU to the Russo brothers!,9,5,13,24 April 2019
The Dark Knight," Dark Knight is a bully
","A long time ago there was this movie, The Cook, The Thief, The Wife and Her Lover by Peter Greenaway which made itself a painfully obvious 'arty' movie i.e. you'd be a pariah to 'not get it' and worse, not like it.The Dark Knight suffers the same malady. Bloated with self-important preachings of 'we get the superhero we need', 'you either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain' and 'unstoppable force meets immovable object' yadayada. It dares anyone to NOT like it. NOT be kind to Heath Ledger in his final role.Oh please. Gimme the layers of Batman Returns any day. It was dark, deep and even had its tongue firmly in the cheek...Batman: 'What do you want? Penguin: Ahh, the direct approach from a man who hides behind a mask' Dark Knight is big with loud bangs and at best ONE character we can root for.Christian Bale, a good Batman, barely engages in the two and half hours.Gyllenhaal is wasted. As is Freeman.Eckhart's slide...too quick and convenient.And Ledger...like I said, how can anyone DARE say a dead man did a bad job? The only person who does his role great justice is Oldman. He is the only person you look forward to seeing on the screen. The rest...well...I'm sure the comic book fans will prop up Dark Knight's ratings but I'm hoping true blue movie buffs can set the record straight.",3,17,45,20 July 2008
Inception," Sign of the times
","Inception is a sign of the times.It is the Google-Twitter-FourSquare-iPhone apps version of a movie.It is a smart idea. It is an idea that manipulates and seduces the masses. It is all about the execution. But ultimately, it is an idea with no heart.It's hard to care for the premise. In these days of BP, do we really care for an energy company vs another energy company? It's even harder to care for the characters. There isn't a Danny Oceanesque easy charm when the team is assembled. There is no single character in the team who we can gravitate towards. And the whole longing father routine doesn't really work.At least The Matrix (first movie) had a heartfelt resolution - that love is the answer. Inception...it's just cold. Clever, but cold.Gimme Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with its tech-with-human-touch idea of pitting memories against the power of love anytime.",4,29,54,1 August 2010
Creed II," Creed deserves Cred
",Take away the mandatory rough and tough training bit. Take away the clumsy reason for fighting Drago the first time and then winning on the rematch. Take away the quiet growth of Stallone as a supporting actor. The scene that got me was when they discovered the child has a hearing condition. No words. Just anxious to knowing looks and tears. Creed II KOs Creed I on that scene alone.,8,0,1,4 December 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Bad man v Super Messed up
","A Batman who behaves likes a hissy teenage girl taking the fight to Superman because there's 'a 1% chance he will destroy earth' when he was shown up to be of not much use when a nuclear warhead was fired or when Doomsday was totaling the city; a Batman who was all set to write his legacy by killing Superman (who doesn't know for a fact if Aquaman and the lot are friend or foe) only to become his friend just like that even saying cringe worthy lines like 'Martha will not die tonight' and the even worse 'I will not fail him in death'...A Superman who could hear Alfred talking to Bruce Wayne at the party from miles away but couldn't tell that a bomb was ticking away less than 5metres away; a Superman who overdoes the love sick puppy bit stopping just short of tears (to an aging Amy Adams gawd); a Superman who gives Batman a face to face warning because that always works with foes (perceived or not)...A movie that has borrowed from James Bond (from Bruce Wayne's aging brooding looks that were probably set for 'smouldering' to the red herring L'Americain-White Portugese to 'key' action sequence linking back to a location from the earlier movie - former MI6 Building v Man of Steel destruction site - to the Aston Martin etc) and Avengers (nuclear warhead, enhanced Iron Man suit, dream sequences - gawd how many were there!?!) with a Jim Carrey/Riddler-like Lex Luther but in an infinitely more annoying Jesse Eisenberg...Actually, 2 out of 10 may be too much for making us suffer two and half hours of a self-important drama but seeing how Warner Bros seems to have bought sooo many 10/10 reviews here, it's about right.Only Gal Gadot looked like she was having fun albeit her brief appearance and therefore, she should be declared the rightful winner of Batman v Superman.",2,157,300,26 March 2016
