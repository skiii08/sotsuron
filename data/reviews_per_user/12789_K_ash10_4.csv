The Ring," Is it just me or is this movie just okay...
",It is surprising to say this movie didn't really scare me. The Ring is about a woman who comes across a video tape that seems to be causing the deaths of people who die seven days after viewing the tape. It's probably my own fault I waited too long to see this movie. I have seen so many horror movies that this film didn't really scare me. However that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It has a good story and some really effective imagery. I was not scared but I was pretty creeped out. In my opinion if you have yet to watch this film and if you are easily scared watch it. But if you are not easily scared watch this with a group of friends so they can get scared and you will have a good time with it. It does have its ups and downs but it was an okay horror movie.,5,3,5,9 January 2016
It Follows," It Doesn't Stop Following You
","After all the buzz I have heard about this movie, I get it now. It Follows is about a teenage girl who through sex develops a way to see an entity, it could be anyone, that will follow her until she is able to pass this unfortunate curse onto someone else. This movie makes for a scary good time. This girl is constantly being followed by someone that you may not see it coming right away or you do see it coming but it's creepy tone almost makes you want to run away. The music in this film definitely drives this film in the right direction. That combined with the film's unsettling plot make the perfect mix. After all that is what made Halloween a great movie. It has good performances but also has a few dumb character moments. This is still a must see for horror film fans and have a good time with.",9,2,8,22 November 2015
Ex Machina," It's Called Artificial Intelligence for a Reason
","This film takes artificial intelligence to a different level. Ex Machina is about a highly intelligent engineer who builds an artificial intelligent woman and allows one lucky technology whiz to come to his house and interact with this new robot being. Unfortunately things get complicated when the robot begins to develop feelings for the young tech whiz and he begins to develop feelings as well. This little group of actors were given almost very little to work with but made it work. Especially applauding the performance by Alicia Vikander as the artificial intelligent being. While some scenes were quite slow, the build to end of the film made those other scenes worth sitting through. The movie also puts you in a box just following these three people. You do feel though as if you are there with them experiencing this. This film was definitely well made though it slightly lacked in keeping the story at a good pace.",8,1,3,9 January 2016
Jurassic World," Welcome to the Park
","It's been awhile I think that I have labeled a film 'a thrill ride' but seriously though this film was a real thrill ride. It takes place about twenty years after the events of the first film. There is now a functioning theme park on the original island. They get thousands of guest and they have tons of money making attractions. But then the people who run the park get a little greedy wanting to make more money and bring in more people so they create a new attraction, one that is more dangerous and scarier then the T-Rex. This film was fantastic. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard lead this film very well almost as a good as Sam Neill and Laura Dern did in the first film. The kids as well Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins did a good job. Colin Trevorrow also was a great choice to helm this film and he did a fantastic job directing. Now yes this film was a sequel and a great one at that. It's been a long time since I have felt that a sequel is just as good as its original. This film to me is really good and just as good as the first film. The special effects were great and one of the best parts was the music. I have been a Jurassic Park fan since I was a little kid and this is actually the first of franchise that I have seen in theaters as well. So this was definitely an amazing experience for me and hearing that original score in this film literally gave me goosebumps.",10,185,319,30 November 2015
