Captain Phillips," Excellent Thriller Very Intense
","I remembered this incident appearing in the news in 2009 but did not know the extent of the trauma involved in the ordeal of the Somali pirates taking over a huge American cargo ship. I wanted to know how truthful the film rendition was to the book A Captain's Duty written by Captain Phillips. There is a good online article available entitled, 'How accurate is Captain Phillips?' by Forrest Wickman for Slate Magazine which provides more details on the accuracy.According to Mr. Wickman's investigation, the film rendition is pretty accurate. I thought it was interesting that the person who played Muse, the captain for the Somali pirates, looks a lot like the real person who is currently serving 33 years in prison in Terre Haute, IN. The actor and the real person are pictured side by side in this online article.I sure hope that Mr. Phillips was treated for Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome after the awful ordeal. To his credit, he did go back to work over a year later in 2010. The time on the Alabama lifeboat with the four Somali pirates was actually five days. One does not get the idea that it was that long in the film.The best acting was at the end when Tom Hanks had to play someone who was in shock and traumatized. He did a great job and said according to this article that the scene was improvised. I found the doctor's or nurse's comments rather irritating at the beginning. Many people in the audience (including me) teared up at the end because finally it was over. It was pretty gripping for a long time. I was so proud of the Navy Seal Team 6 for their great work in solving the crisis. What would we do without them? Definitely worth seeing. It holds one's attention easily. I would say that it's too intense for young adults (13-15 year olds). There is some violence as would be expected. It has a PG-13 rating.",8,0,5,12 October 2013
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Very enjoyable and suspenseful
","I happened upon this movie through On Demand and it grabbed my attention and did not disappoint. It goes for 2 hours and possibly the editing could have been tightened up but the story line is compelling, and so one has to see it to the end. I enjoyed Eddie Lowery who played Francis Ouimet's caddie by default, but he proved to be a great adviser, friend and encourager. My favorite line of Eddie's was: 'Read it, roll it, hole it,' on the last hole of the playoff at the US Open in 1913. Vardon was classy as the British opponent who also came from humble beginnings, and as it said holds the record for winning six British Opens. I think most anyone would enjoy this movie. I liked Shia LeBeouf as Francis. Shia considered this part as his first coming of age role.",8,0,0,18 February 2017
The Wolverine," Boring, Yawn, Once was Enough
","I am certainly not an expert on X-Men and the Wolverine. I only wished I had read some reviews before I went to see this. I like Hugh Jackman, but the plot and the pace of this film were too boring. It starts out interesting enough but it is downhill from there. 75% of the film IMHO is violent. The fight scenes could have been shortened for at least 30 minutes. The film is 126 minutes long. I could have tolerated it better if it was 96 minutes long. I left it feeling I had wasted my time, and I would definitely not recommend it to my friends. I am not a fan of violence coupled with a non-engaging plot. I found myself wanting it to be over long before it was. The action scene fight on the Bullet train made me think of Skyfall the James Bond movie which had a train scene fight as well. That movie was so much better than this. The PG-13 rating should be more of an R because of so much violence and adult topics. It's best for the over 17 audience, not the early teens.",2,5,11,3 August 2013
