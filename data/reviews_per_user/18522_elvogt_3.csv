The Ring," One of the scariest of the last years
","Brilliant photography kept me on the edge of the seat. For a long time, this was the first movie were I really was afraid for the characters.
Intriguing storyline with a decent solution, a number of very cool ideas (the fly on the screen...), and most of all the cool images which stuck to my mind.If you're into horror movies, check this one out. And turn off the phone before you watch it.",Null,1,1,15 May 2003
Memento," Gripping, stunning, intelligent
","Actually, I have little to add to the majority of comments listed here, but since I just saw this movie the other night, and it really impressed me, I thought I might chime in:The notion with which I entered the cinema was, 'How gripping may a movie be if the end is given away in the beginning?', and the answer turned out to be- pretty much.I agree, this is probably not #9 of all movies ever made. It's one more flick in the line of the others doubting our identity (like _Matrix_ or _Truman Show_), which seems to be the question of the new millenium. The acting is average, and the characters don't get too much depth, but I suspect this is a consequence of the way the story is told.But the story is captivating, and it's narrated in an amazing way. The unfolding is very clever, and I found myself fully concentrating on the plot, all the time. (Of course, my attempts to be _ahead_ of the story were moot in a picture which is told _backwards_.) As opposed to _Matrix_, which seemed to me to be an insult to my intelligence, this one was a challenge to it. I had expected a lot of the audience to give up halfway through and start to chatter and stuff, but everyone seemingly stayed focussed till the end (I'd take this as a compliment to the film team)- and what an end it was! I went out of the cinema fairly disturbed...Bottom line: Very nice idea, cleverly executed, always worth the admission to the cinema, or a tape's rent. But since the idea is not really _deep_, and since the way the story's told limits the story somewhat, it's not an alltime great. 8.5/10(P.S.: Some people questioned why Leonard would know where to find his photos and stuff all the time- he repeatedly pointed out in the picture that he has conditioned himself to do so, that he got into the 'habit' of looking for them, a feat he still could manage, as opposed to Sam.)",Null,0,1,18 December 2001
The Thin Red Line," So... lots of grass, and war is a bad thing?
","Although I appreciate this film as a sincere attempt, I must say that it completely escaped me.I saw it lately with the highest expectations after it had received quite a lot of good reviews, but I found it lacked virtually everything. Everything was drawn out into length, from the exposition on the native island to the closing credits, and even the battle scenes got you bored quite quickly -- not to mention the endless grassy hills on the pacific islands.Characters? Hm. Not a whole lot of characters around, to be honest, not to mention any development. We don't get to see a whole lot of people _before_ the battle, and as soon as the battle starts, everybody gets hysteric and is reduced to screaming and crying. (And the screaming goes quickly on your nerves, as does the tedious voice-over poetry... it's a film, for Christ's sake, not a poetry slam!) Travolta and Clooney could have been fun characters, but their cameos obviously were introduced only to lure a few more people into the cinemas...And the plot? I don't think there was one, neither was there a story being told. After the storming of the Japanese camp, I sincerely thought the film was over, and was quite surprised to see another story line unfold (the assault on the creek) -- which was a completely pointless addition, IMHO.All in all, it felt like a two-hour something snapshot of war, designed to tell me that war is bad. Okay, I knew that before, and the snapshot concept simply doesn't work here: Pitching the audience into battle like the soldiers, and exposing them to the same confusion, just leads to different effects: Soldiers will fear for their lifes, but the audience will just get bored and lose interest.Although I was very well inclined to the movie in the first place, it simply failed to catch me, and I sat through the two hours dutifully, but without real interest in the people or the story. (Story? Which story?)P.S.: Trying to avoid having goodies and baddies was a nice idea. But the explanation and 'justification' of Nolte's character was a bit too much (like the whole film was 'too much' of everything)... pleading too verbosely for his innocence will only make him look guilty...",Null,1,2,31 October 2003
