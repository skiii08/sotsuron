The Blair Witch Project," The Scariest Thing About This Movie is the Money It's Made
","Many have already commented on the vapid plotline of this movie. I have to add my vote to that with the further remark that there is little if no characterization in Blair Witch.  Not unless you like whining twenty-some-year-olds who adore using the 'f' word a lot. 
About half way through, bored out of my mind, I not only was rooting for the witch, but feeling aggressive myself.  If there had been 'kill Heather' or 'kill Josh' buttons to push on my VCR, I would have punched them without an ounce of regret.The only good things going for Blair Witch is that it would be fairly creative for a high school class project (if it were one) and that it attempts to create suspense without all kinds of overblown special effects. Still, if the writers/directors/etc. had read an article or a book on how to create horror/suspense, they would have developed characters with which the audience could identify (I hate to think about who DOES identify with this bunch) and who have more of a personal stake in finding out about the legend of the witch.  If you're really curious, rent this for 99 cents like I did -- though you may still feel cheated.",1,2,4,18 December 1999
The English Patient," The Nurse Should Have Shot Him
","Although this movie's plot ostensibly is not a bad one, its moral is sadly amiss.  I don't understand how audiences can watch it and not realize that the title character sold thousands of lives to the Nazis by turning over maps of North Africa.  Why?  To return to the side of a dead woman who did not have the grace and courage to tell him to leave her and live on for her as Dawson did in Titanic.This movie is a sad commentary on where we have gone in our thinking since the days of Casablanca. If I had been the nurse, I would have shot the English patient in the beginning of the film!  I know too many people whose relatives died in German gas chambers.",1,15,29,3 December 1998
