Your Name.," Fantastic but not perfect
","Recently I've been reviewing the films I watch as soon as I can after watching them as a way of channelling my thoughts.I've just finished 'Your Name' and have to agree with a lot of people on here, it's quite fantastic. The story and themes are very interesting and I found the film kept me engaged with shifts in tone / plot that felt natural and paced well.Additionally the animation is gorgeous and a lot of the music was achingly beautiful.However, some of the music (mainly the poorly timed pop ballads) felt out of place and actually served to draw me out of the experience as a whole. Some of the ballads worked but I felt the orchestral music alone would did a great job on the emotional cue's of the film. Furthermore, I think the characters were slightly two-dimensional (or not as individualised as they could have been) and the story falls into a familiar and rather cheesy conclusion, but it fit the tone of the film overall, it just wasn't entirely believable. Other than that it's a great watch and I'd happily watch again, it's a lovely film and does a great job at sucking you into its world.4/5",8,1,1,15 January 2018
The Irishman," A Sombre Tale
","This is Scorcese's anti-mob film.The last 40 minutes of The Irishman put everything up until then into a new light. Suddenly everything makes sense and the film becomes a heartbreaking and poignant epilogue to gangster culture and its violent history.Speaking of violence, the Irishman is violent but in no way glorified (nor is it in any of his other films)... in fact it's quite the opposite. The violence here is quick, brutal, cold and almost cowardly, where respect can become naivety and get you killed.It's this respect that Scorcese is more interested in depicting; the familial bond these gangsters have with one another and the respect they have for each other.This is a sombre tale of regret and broken families, isolation and loneliness, a violent tale of power and betrayal, and overall a tale of powerful men that gain strength through each other, and the respect of others.That said, my main criticism is that yes, it is indeed too long. That's not to suggest that the film doesn't earn its runtime, like I said the last 40 minutes really do hit hard.It's in those last 40 minutes where the lack of a strong female presence throughout the film is justified and actually benefits the message it's trying to send. Still, I think it was a missed opportunity not have a stronger female role in the film.My other issue would be the CGI... whilst it is fantastic, there some scenes where the elderly bodies of the actors with young heads really drew me out of the immersion as it just looked bizarre.Overall The Irishman is a long and rather downbeat story with a lot to say but only at the end... the plot isn't anything remarkable and has similarities to Scorsese's previous films but stick with it to the end and its guaranteed to have you thinking for a while afterward.",8,3,6,28 January 2020
Captain America: Civil War," Pretty Damn Good
","I haven't read a single coherent review for this film yet as IMDb seems to be full of angry fanboys that don't seem to realise how ridiculous comic book films are. If, like me, you are a little disenfranchised with the MCU films, and you tried watching BVS and realised D.C. will continue to produce utter bilge as long as Zack Snyder is around to make them 'dark and gritty', you'll understand my trepidation before watching Civil War.I couldn't be more surprised at how good Civil War was. A comic book film that earns its dramatic moments, gives everyone a motive and a relevant amount of screen time, throws in some truly spectacular action sequences AND can make light of itself every now and then when it gets too serious BECAUSE IT'S A FILM ABOUT SUPER HEROS FFS. This film isn't perfect, I found myself trying to keep up with the plot in places as everything moves quite quickly. Additionally, the beginning feels a little rushed to get to the main bulk of the story and themes, but I can forgive it for actually having a good story and strong themes that it sticks to. The issue is the Fan boys / Zack Snyder fan boys that need to realise not everything needs to be super serious as that makes dull cinema. Nolan achieved it with his Batman trilogy BECAUSE HE'S AN EXTEMELY TALENTED FILMMAKER WITH A GREAT WRITER AS A BROTHER. Snyder consistently tries to make things more poignant without actually earning the right to be, resulting in boring cinema because we're not invested in his characters.Anyway, I could go on for hours about how moronic some of the reviews from fan boys are but overall this film is a great action adventure that I'm more than certain you'll enjoy if you watched the other MCU films.",8,0,2,4 April 2018
The Shape of Water," A few big problems (Contains very slight spoilers)
","Yes, everything you've heard about this film is true, it's gorgeous, well acted, well written, entertaining and provides a lot to sink your teeth into in terms of symbolism and themes... but there's a few big problems I had with it...For me, the central romantic relationship was silly, I never bought into it. It almost felt rushed to me, like the writers didn't believe it either. Girl meets fish monster, girl instantly falls for fish monster even though it is rather terrifying and has already maimed someone, girl gives rather tacked on reason for her feelings etc. Personally it wasn't enough to buy this rather strange coupling of souls, unless you're easily pleased in films I suppose.Which leads onto my other problem with the film. Had this film been longer it really could have taken the time to add more depth and exposition to the loneliness everyone supposedly feels and Elisa's past so their motivations and actions made sense... it really felt a bit rushed throughout and I really wasn't as emotionally invested like everyone else claims they were. If you were to compare the portrayal of loneliness in this film to the likes of a film such as Moon... Moon has a much bigger impact, but then Del Toro crams a heck of a lot more into this film. On top of all this I found it very hard to believe some of the events in the film because of some annoying plot holes (the poor security in the supposed 'high security' facility being the most jarring). The film was never more than a delightful romp, rather than the high art some people are labelling it.I realise my review is quite negative but overall the film really is a lot of fun. It was never boring, it was funny, the set design and cinematography is astonishing, the acting is top notch, the story is good fun if rather hackneyed and there's a lot to take from it, but overall the film never reached the heights of Pan's Labyrinth or Devil's Backbone, because it never took itself seriously and remained very much a simple fairy tale, rather than the dramatic masterpiece I was hoping it would be. 4/5 Side note : I have noticed a lot of critics praise films very highly when they reference many other films so this may be where the gushing of love for this film has come from.",7,3,6,19 February 2018
