The Blair Witch Project," Simple, but perfect. The most believable scary movie ever.
","I never realized that hand-held camera work could be so intense and believable yet disturbing. Since the exorcist, I have never been so at the edge of my seat during a movie. The acting is incredible, true human nature, no heroes, just real people reacting in 'real situations'. I consider this movie to be a myth-breaker, no fancy camera work, or incredible special effects, not even music was needed to get the audience so involved in the story. From now on, low-budget filmmaking will never be the same.",Null,1,1,1 September 1999
