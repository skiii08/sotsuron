Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What a letdown! No originality, no magic, no fun...
","The first STAR WARS was maybe the best science-fiction/adventure movie ever done. EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI were pretty O.K. as sequels go. But! PHANTOM MENACE was the worst movie of the year!!! No creativity!: only rehashed ideas from the other films of the series... No magic!: who cared about the characters? JarJar Binx anyone? Anakin Skywalker? (maybe if they had an ACTOR playing him; Jake Llyod is certainly not destined for the oscar)... No fun! No rhythm! No story! Some good actors, but no good acting... There's not really a beginning, and there's not really an end... And, for sure, there is no point!!!",1,4,8,5 February 2000
