The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," great movie
","this was a wonderful movie, for us who are twilight fans, we waited for breaking dawn part 1, and wow it was worth the wait. we are looking forward to breaking dawn part 2. so let us twilight/hard fans enjoy,keep your negative opinions to yourself. the movie was very watchable, and i would watch it again as a lot others have. if there's a six film production, (hoping with the same cast and crew), we will wait for it also- hope it would be about (leah) she needs to be happy, either way, we are sure whatever they decide to do in the future the story lines only would be better and better. as long as our happy Cullen family couples remains together, love the closeness of the that family. whatever they decide to do we are sure it will be excellent to us twilight fans. so Stephanie Meyers please keep up the good explosive work-thanks for the cast and crew, they are the best combination. i have purchased all the books, movies, and soundtracks all outstanding. waiting patiently for more. Edward and Bella with baby and so much love between them and the entire family, just breathtaking. thanks",8,1,7,5 March 2012
