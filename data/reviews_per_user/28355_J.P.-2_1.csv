Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Beginning of the new saga.
","I was a little disappointed the first time I saw The Phantom Menage because it was too slow for what I was expecting.  I was trying to pay attention to the plot and what was going on that I didn't get to enjoy the movie.  The second time, however, I got to see things that I wasn't able to see before. I was still disappointed from what the previews pumped the movie up to be, and the digital animation took something away from the original.  However, it was still Star Wars, and if you are a fan and haven't seen it yet, I do recommend that you go to it A.S.A.P.  You will understand things in the original three that you wouldn't have understood had this movie never been released.",Null,0,0,23 May 1999
