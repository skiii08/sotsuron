Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Definitely Worth Waiting For
","It's really beyond me why huge majority of Star Wars-fans consider the first trilogy SO much better than episodes I-III. Usual explanation is that the storyline and characters were by far more interesting. Well, I don't agree. Although I also have very fond memories of the original Star Wars-movie (and it's sequels) since it was my very first non-cartoonish feature I saw in theater (twice) at age 10, I already back then realized that these movies aren't by any significant margin above cartoon-level anyhow. Awesome, epoch making, brilliantly entertaining scifi with great special effects surely. So throughout the 1990's after I first heard that George Lucas was planning those brand new episodes, becoming possible by revolutionary CGI-technology, I knew there was something spectacular on its way. And I wasn't disappointed. To my money, now having seen them all, Episode I - The Phantom Menace is The Best of the whole series: Special FX leave nothing to desire, just as one assumed; action-scenes and overall pace are beautifully orchestrated; Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are among my very favorite actors and their line delivery is always ear-pleasing, no matter what they say; and it all climaxes in the greatest sword-fight ever, laser or not, in movie history. Granted, there are long speeches and meetings couple too many, the podrace-scene is a tad too long also, and obligatory funny 'black' character Jar Jar Binks is VERY unfunny, but those are minor flaws. Especially compared to myriad of shortcomings found in former episodes, particularly in Return Of The Jedi, the only actual black sheep of the whole saga. Once and for all, it's mind blowing effects that have always defined these movies for me, other aspects come distant second.",10,4,8,17 September 2005
As Good as It Gets," Could've got so much better
","Huge Emotions Interpreter-director's another relationship-rally goes wrong in one detail and with that in everything: Jack Nicholson's mean and racist s.o.b. is GENUINELY sick person, having compulsive neurosis disorder or something like that. Not so much though that he'd be permanently committed or that Helen Hunt's good-looking (and seemingly sane) thirty-something waitress wouldn't fall for the bastard. He's been the way he is 50 years or so, he have had some treatment, seen shrinks etc, so he's not going to improve. He is and will be sick in his mind in the most unbearable way. But Hunt's character just couldn't do better. Very believable. But in the end, and putting it all together, I guess the movie's real message is that even an ignorant and disliked hetero male still succeeds in this world of ours over single-parent mothers and homosexuals. At least Nicholson's character seems to be economically stable and even 'satisfied' by his own standards. He has the privilege to safely assume in his state of mind that everything bad is always other people's fault and period.",1,10,29,7 August 2008
Django Unchained," Tarantino hates the way history turned out
","This is as typical Tarantinoesque ultra-violent 'race'-message as one could expect from start to finish in its unnecessary length of 165 minutes, and I for one am really getting fed up by it. Its obvious occasional funny bits can't compensate the dullness of those innumerable 'transit'scenes and everything that happens with Leonardo DiCaprio and afterwards.On the other hand, at least DiCaprio approaches the seeds of truth when he explains the black man's 'willingnes to submit' to their 'white masters', instead of fighting back from day one or die trying; there would had not been such thing as 'black slavery'. And this Django-character here actually proves that point: since they simply didn't refuse to be slaves, the black man's only hope was that there would emerge some kind of miraculous black superhero who could overcome and kill all the white people. Of course there never did. It was only the white man who had the power to took and eventually give back (well, kind of) their freedom. And only because it was the white man who came up first with e.g. powerful industrialism and agriculture the things weren't other way around completely ('for some reason' the Africans were never much of a threat for Europeans but Mongols and Ottomans among others definitely were).By the way, how did Django the Slave learn how to read, shoot a gun and use a whip like a pro only Tarantino the Writer knows.All above said, Waltz is very good once again as expected and even Foxx of which I never liked too much in other movies ('Ray' of course being an exception) performs OK in his 'impossible' role. But as some have already mentioned, it's the final 1/3 or so that destroys this movie almost utterly in all its stupidity.",2,8,11,14 February 2015
Schindler's List," My conclusion why he did it...
","First: is this a great and an important movie? Of course it is, like all the films about the holocaust. Truly, have you ever seen a bad movie (or series, or even a document for that matter) made about the subject? I haven't. Like most great, based-on-facts tragedies, stories about concentration camps require too much serious thinking, talent and at least adequate budget to start with before anything happens. Filmmaker just couldn't fail with real-life drama of this magnitude in his hands. Neither could Mr. Spielberg.Well, still, even considering above-mentioned, Spielberg did an excellent job. 'Schindler's List' is technically brilliant: beautifully shot with its vast use of different camera distances and angles, and stark b/w realization (which always adds extra-interest for modern day film-enthusiastic). Cast is also superb (Liam Neeson to me is almost the very personification of 'trustworthy') and set design perfect, naturally, due to on-location shooting in Poland. The only, but nevertheless quite notable complaint is length; the movie is by definition unnecessarily overlong.So, why did Oskar Schindler do it? Now, I'm a Finn with some German-Swedish heritage, and there's very unlikely one Jewish cell in my body. And I'm no bleeding-heart liberal either, pretty much vice versa. But I'm an intelligent guy with very strong comprehension what comes to 'right' and 'wrong'. So, given the same opportunities, money and influence, I would had for sure at least attempted the same kind of rescue-mission Schindler accomplished. Because I couldn't bear either just stand aside and watch an absolute and continuous torment of innocents. That's the very and simple reason for Schindler, a human being, too: he HAD the money and chance to save those people and he did. Only it took courage and an ability to successfully deal with crazy monsters (Nazis). And I, too, think that when there's a decision between life and death to be made, money means nothing. So it's so easy for me to identify with Oskar Schindler. Only the world this rotten and greedy even questions his motives.Still, one possible and a little more cynical explanation, which I anyway think must had played at least minor part considering Schindler's (AND also that German officer's in 'The Pianist') motives: Germany had already clearly lost the war. One can only guess if they would had acted exactly the same way in other circumstances...",10,9,13,26 January 2005
The Illusionist," Terribly uninvolved
","First of all, showing 'magic-tricks' in a movie is somewhat dead and pointless idea to begin with. At least they should never be the main issue, AT LEAST so that no explanation is given to a (film)viewer despite their often supernatural elements, like especially in this case. ('The Prestige', though also very flawed film, anyway showed us what was happening behind (and under) the sets too.) But these malfunctions aside, even outside the stage there's not much to say about the plot anyhow, only that it's shallow and predictable.But what really makes this film utterly a failure is terrible handling of its character-development and realization. Yes, there are moments people are obviously trying very hard to show emotions, but none of those moments ring true, none. In a film like this, where all kinds of illusions are the king, all the more important it'd be to have lively and genuine performances and characters. Jessica Biel looks pretty but as an actor she's totally transparent. There's nothing happening inside her. Sadly, same goes for Mr Norton here too. He's in his role of a great magician also outside his act so much that every time he tries to break out from his numbness it's too late and unbelievable. (As a matter of fact, Edward Norton, one of the greatest actors of the 90's, has been frighteningly disappointing for the last 5 yrs or so.) Rufus Newell as a Crown Prince, unknown to me and by this performance, remains so. And finally Paul Giamatti. He should only concentrate on comedy, rolling those big eyes just don't do the 'trick' anymore, especially here as a Chief of Police. He's no hero and is a little bit too weak and small and overweight even for Everyman.The movie was produced by the same guys who did Sideways and Crash, both enormously overrated films too. But character-wise, The Illusionist is actually very fitting continuation. Weak, weak, weak. And director is someone called 'Burger'. Well, for me that name is only half right...",2,7,11,14 July 2007
Grudge Match," Too much monkey business
","Not that it's been on the highest level for quite sometime anyhow, but I'm really starting to lose my last remaining hopefulness regarding new generations. Of movies and their watchers. Here's latest reason for this: 'Grudge Match'... What a dud! And especially considering the initial (and natural) fears I had before watching those other 'stallone-rehashs' Rocky Balboa (2006) and Rambo (2008) and finding them actually somewhat tolerable in their sadness/tiredness/cynicism, the overall awfulness of this turkey is even more amazing.Well yes, OK, above mentioned were always meant to be 'more serious' than this one, but of course with GM you get your excessive amount of 'drama' and 'bitter relationships' between laughs too. (Or embarrassed grunts, as in my case.) It seems like even some genuine emotions from viewers are phished, but everything is ruined by predictability... Predictability? Try EVERY character's EVERY reaction/remark in EVERY scene, worst examples being no-brainer: Kevin Hart, Alan Arkin, that grandkid. But I still wouldn't claim they act bad, but rather fill their horrible roles flawlessly.All I am saying: 6.4 average for this calculated, manipulative, childish, cliché-ridden vomit is essentially too much. People get wrong ideas.",1,4,7,15 December 2015
The Imitation Game," Calculated emotionless boredom
","I'm sorry to say this (or am I...!) but I think most of the people here who found this movie less than masterpiece have concentrated too much on 'historical inaccuracies'. They can be annoying of course, but in my opinion e.g. 'Mutiny On The Bounty' (1935) or 'They Died With Their Boots On' (1941) are the best and most entertaining b/w-movies ever made while what comes to historical facts being almost pure fiction from start to finish.My problem with this film is the same I have with nearly all British productions (despite a Norwegian director): every dramatic or humorous scene feels too predictable and calculated. How, frinstance, it is possible that these super-geniuses (along with their supervisors) can't understand the importance of keeping their successful code-breaking a secret from the enemy? And as if they wouldn't had discussed about the matter since the day one? On top of the above mentioned, and while Benedict Cumberbatch acts flawlessly, the main character's totally alienating obscurity and antisocial manners made me utterly uninterested about his endeavours. Not to mention his homosexuality which demolished all the excitement and affection of his relationship with Keira Knightley too. I just didn't care how he's gonna end up a slightest bit, and when this happens it obviously ruins movie experience like nothing else. No matter how 'classy' the film otherwise appears to be.",3,10,14,23 January 2016
From Dusk Till Dawn," Don't miss the point peasants
","Even otherwise surprisingly lenient Roger Ebert rattles about the two-partness as everyone here. Well yes, obviously and admittingly it takes over-the-top turn when it does. But at that moment we have been introduced to these worst hardcore (cop)killing-machines imaginable so next question is who could stop them? So what if they just 'tease' bikers in that seemingly normal bikerbar? No, it's kill kill kill 'before the dawn comes' as is the name of the game, vampires at least give some major challenge. Also as is mentioned early in the movie, this is a flick for us 'Wild Bunch'-fans: ultra-violence with characters to care for. And in any case it's on comicstrip-level from start to finish anyhow, in the lines of 'RoboCop', all of them zombie-movies etc. To review this otherwise is just plain stupid.",9,1,3,25 July 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," Getting older means progress?
","I saw this the first time as 11-yo during re-run in 1978. Didn't get it, obviously, already having experienced much more entertaining cinematic wonders like 'Star Wars' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. Then I saw it again on video in mid 80's making not that much more impression, while of course the message was somewhat understood. And then again and again from a video or television broadcasts, before finally began to really like the picture for its merits. But what truly did it for me: my home theater! What an awesome, exhilarating movie in the form AT LEAST the way it should be: 2 x 1 meters on your own wall. (With adequate sound systems naturally.) And as I mentioned before, I had grown at least technically. Progressed as far as my species go? Very hard to tell. But how many bothers to seek any re-evaluation?",9,2,5,15 June 2013
Love Actually," All you don't need is rubbish like this
","This sort of a British version of Altman's 'Short Cuts' (1993) is lightly brisk and totally intellect insulting romantic comedy, exactly the way a movie should be I think when it's targeted by precision for Holiday season and women, elderly and 'those boys'. I was, actually, already willing to stop watching this nonsense after the scene where cute Keira Knightly is getting interracially married and soul brothers and sisters begin to destroy The Beatles from the church balcony. (I don't hate black people, I just don't like to see them ruin the gems of the western culture!) In addition, the new PM Hugh Grant, judging by his behavior, simply couldn't have any previous experience of politics whatsoever, etc etc... The only achievers are always pleasant Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, as is Bill Nighy in his deliciously vicious and cynical aging rocker role. But even their contributions get lost in this over two hours and a hundred speaking parts mess. The worst torture awaits in the end, last half an hour or so, of which I doubt any normal male aged 15-60 is able to get away without diabetes... A couple of interesting cameos: Rowan Atkinson in his small role as a clerk in jewellery store is quite funny, actually, but Claudia Schiffer as a 'gift from heaven' makes you wither in pain once again. Final message for all involved: some films are made with heart, some with balls, but you always need brains too.",1,7,14,6 April 2008
Shooter," Is all said and done in movies?
","There are some hard-hitting scenes in this film to be sure, and the camera-work isn't so intolerably excessive like in most Hollywood films of today. In fact it's almost as efficient as in those very good 'Jason Bourne'-movies. But therein lies the biggest problem, too: nothing in Shooter is original. Nothing. Of course, if it's the first shoot 'em up action -flick (with political undertones and an assassination plot with a fall guy) you've ever seen you might like this. Especially if you like Mark Wahlberg who to me is not much of an actor. Far from even Matt Damon's capabilities for sure. And veterans Danny Glover and Ned Beatty got impossible, laughable roles, but at least they seem to have a blast with them. So, you might also like this movie if you're able to not to take it too seriously, even if the flick itself fails even in that department.What I'm really trying to say is: those who cry for this movie's 'liberal, even left-wing and anti-US message' do take this FAR too seriously. Because in a stupid movie like this there can't be any real message to anybody. Unless it's the fact that judging by the Hollywood films of the 2000's people's IQ has dropped at least 20 points since the 1970's. Or, and I believe this theory hits closer to the mark, the film companies try nowadays to please EVERYBODY with their productions, just for money's sake of course. Especially the adolescent/teen viewers, no matter how adult themes movie supposedly has. Hence, this all superficiality.",1,11,25,2 July 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," What's SO special?
","This is a good movie, and surely is right up there among the finest prison/concentration camp depictions which almost ALWAYS have at least competent quality. In my mind I compare this genre to 'submarine'-films: confined space, lots of guys under constant threat, therefore drama and tension easily created without much sweat (ha ha). But also with obvious problems in providing something new. The same situations and characters are presented just from here to eternity, and I rest my case with this movie in question as follows: despotic warden, sadistic guard/s, evil fellow inmates who want to kill/rape you but also few trusted friends (along with that one old timer and his inevitable sad ending) and finally escape by the main protagonist who of course has been convicted in the first place based on false accusations or at least something not-so-bad crime.So what's so special here? 9.1/10, come on... Maybe the same tricks worked here as in that other Stephen King's hit-penitentiary-drama 'The Green Mile', i.e. manipulative scenes and quickly identified cardboard characters. Or maybe the majority of movie-goers consider what they're watching at face value and never mind that 'I've seen this all before'-feel. Or maybe they haven't or just have a lousy memory? Yes I admit, I'm something of a cynic. But I also believe I'm able to spot an truly honest effort when I see one. Probably that's the reason why I consider the grandpa of them all, Mervyn LeRoy's 1932 'I'm A Fugitive From A Chain Gang' as the all-time best prison-flick. No film-snobbery here, as I hope you'll agree when you see this true classic.",7,17,36,21 September 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the most overrated movies ever
","First problem: this could have been quite shocking and groundbreaking movie in the 1970's, not after the decade of splatter, gore, mad slashers and all kinds of overwhelming violence, the 80's. And of course especially not after the first film-version of the Thomas Harris' book 'Red Dragon', aka 'Manhunter' by Michael Mann, which intensity and credibility is in a whole different level. So there was nothing exceptional happening on the screen to me when I saw this even back in 1991, being of course much more dated now. Sure, the majority of moviegoers bought this whole, at least partly due to being the one serial killer- horror-movie that also women could understand and relate to through the main character.Second problem: I've had this little rule of my own how one can quickly define a director's talent while watching a film. I'll do it by close-ups, especially of the faces. The more close-ups the worse as they lose their effect. Martin Scorsese, Roman Polanski, Steven Spielberg, Sam Peckinpah, Stanley Kubrick... they all use them only temporarily, on the right occasion as they should be. Then there are these guys who cherish those facial close-ups in almost EVERY scene like Tony Scott or Renny Harlin, which is, annoyingly, Demme's way of depicting major confrontations in 'The Lambs' too. When Hopkins' or Foster's face fill the screen, either delivering or receiving, there's nothing frightening or emotional to me. It's manipulative and ridiculous, destined to be followed by all kinds of mockery spoofs and rightly so. It's soap opera. In the last resort, and to make the problem worse, the interplay between characters just isn't that intelligent and challenging as everybody and his sister seems to think.Third problem: Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are widely regarded as one of the best actors in (movie) history. I don't agree. While they're no hams either I still find them to be on top only in the category of 'mannerism'. Which is a little odd because judging by many many interviews I've seen over the years they are clearly quite intelligent persons. Particularly in this movie, they're are SO self-conscious in every scene. They are not talking to each other, they are talking to that scary middle-aged lady in the aisles. And what really is so special in Jodie Foster's performance? She behaves all the time perfectly normally and logically (why in the first place someone even WANTS to see a 'vulnerable' woman as an FBI-agent is beyond me), so how come Lecter-Hopkins has that unusual interest in her? And being a true female police, she almost screws up busting that serial-killer by making wrong decisions in every turn in the climax... Many actions are too unbelievable compared to reaching for realism in many other levels.I don't mind that much about this movie's success in the box office and not even it's undeserved but ongoing status as sort of phenomenon, but those five main Academy Awards for only the third time in Hollywood history was incomprehensible. Even just considering 'serial killer'-depictions, this is somewhere 6th or 7th best in its genre on my list. But so that leaving you all 'Lambs'-lovers with more positive feelings I have to admit there is one good, clever and truly exciting scene after all: Lecter's escape. Glimmers among the rest of the garbage like a shiny kitchen knife....",5,17,42,8 August 2006
