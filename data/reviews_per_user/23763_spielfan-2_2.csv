Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is an incredibly underrated movie.
","Is it possible for a film that has made over $400 million at the box office to also be one of the most underrated films of all time?  I think so. Like many people, I was not sure what to think after I watched TPM for the first time.  There had been so much media speculation about it before it's release that any movie, any story, any performances would almost seem a disappointment.  I have, however, since seen it again and without the anticipation factor, I was able to see the movie for what it was, an excellent opening act for a continued story.  Within the frame of the film, there was a plethora of brilliant images and beautiful symbolisms.  There is a lot more going on in the mind of George Lucas than dollar signs.  The power of the music is also unquestionable.  John Williams has created a score that not only underscores the emotions of the film, but it also stands as a very strong piece of music on it's own.  And finally, I have to say it...I didn't find Jar Jar annoying.  I know that saying this will render me on the unpopular side of the issue, but he was the film's comic relief and in that capacity, he served very well.",Null,0,0,8 October 1999
Armageddon," As if specifically written for Mystery Science Theater 3000.
","When I go to the theater so see a movie, I am usually the epitome of theater etiquette.  I am quiet and thoughtful and considerate of the people around me.  This is consistantly true, with one exception...when I saw 'Armageddon'.  It was as if the producers and writers got together and said, 'hey, let's help out the people at Mystery Science Theater 3000 by making a big-budget version of the type of swill they usually watch.'  As I watched this movie in the theater, the smart-aleck comments rose from my vocal chords with such ease.  It was filled with such an unabashed ineptitude that I felt that I had to respond vocally.  Why was the movie so bad?  Oh, where to begin!  With so many elements to consider...the infamous 'animal cracker love scene'...the meteor growling, not expelling gas or exploding, but growling(!!!)as it passes the camera...the entire 'end of the world as light-hearted comedy' mentality of the production...I just am inundated with compelling arguments for this to be considered one of the worst films of all time.  However, in defense of the movie, I've never enjoyed such a horrible movie this much.  The rhythm of the scenes is perfect for outside comments. In fact, I bought the movie specifically for the purpose of having parties to make fun of it.  When this element is added, the movie becomes quite delightful.  It's a shame that Mystery Science Theater 3000 is no more. What fun they could have had with this bomb.",2,0,1,9 October 1999
