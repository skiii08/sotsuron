The Ring," Surprisingly good and pretty scary
",I had an open mind about this one.  The only concern I had was that it might be just another awful teen movie (I'm 33 and long past all that!).  I was pleased with what I saw:  it was scary without any over-the-top gory scenes - there's lots of frights and a bit of suspense with an overall weirdness thrown in.The movie went along at a nice pace - not too slow (I get bored easily!) and it really kept my interest all the way through: I really wanted to find out the answers to all the happenings!  The film was shot well with good use of effects.A lot of movies fail miserably to find a good ending but I liked this one - I'll say no more of course!,8,1,1,22 February 2003
Catch-22," The craziness of war... and people too. An outstanding film.
","I own Catch-22 on DVD. It's my favourite movie of all time.Don't be put off by thinking it's a war film. Although it's set on an American air force base in the Mediterranean during WWII, the film is really about the characters, who are played by an excellent (and star-studded) cast.The main character is Captain Yossarian (superbly portrayed by Alan Arkin), a bombardier who absolutely hates being there and, although practically driven crazy with fear & desperation, appears completely sane when compared to the lunatics that surround him.The photography is awesome and the sound tremendous: crank-up your speakers to get the full effect of the roaring engines of the B-25 bombers as they taxi past the camera. I'm no expert but the way this movie is edited is exquisite: I love the flash-backs that are sprinkled through the film, each giving you a little more than the last. Plot aside, this film is worth watching as a work of art.From the intriguing opening scene to the crazy abandon of the final scene, this movie is a though-provoking masterpiece of satirical, black-humour that is deserving of more than one viewing: I seem to get more out of it each time I watch it. It's not a brainless comedy and does require the viewer's attention to get the best from it but I wouldn't call it heavy-going either.I can't comment on how true it is (or isn't) to the book as I really didn't get on with it but, as a movie it's superb. It was nominated for awards but didn't win any, which is incomprehensible to me.",10,0,4,27 February 2008
