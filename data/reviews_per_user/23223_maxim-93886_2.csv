Hereditary," Scary and very freaky too
","I must say not many movies gives me the chills, and I laugh at many horror, sci-fi and mystery combination movies and I tend to sleep afterwards really peaceful, but this one, gave me chills, kept me on the edge, freaked my mind out and ended up causing me a struggle to go to sleep ... The best time to watch this would be at Midnight or bit later or just before midnight so that when the clock strikes 12 a person must be by the horror, sci-fi and mystery parts",10,4,7,6 October 2018
A Quiet Place," Not scary as much, it's okay, entertaining
","Many were saying that this is an ultimate scary horror, but to me, not as much, this type of movies will keep me glued but not scared ... It was entertaining though ... But the father's character, okay well played but also bit annoying. After his wife gives birth he goes looking for their children, who is waiting for him at top of the ceilo (yeah okay excuse the spelling) where they tend to light the torch type thing, he goes into the opposite direction to look for them and only when they are heard by one of the creatures does he start running towards them (stupid, pretty much). Then he's sacrificial death to save his kids - seriously, who does that, he could've fought it off actually, instead he drops his gun and stand in front of the car waiting for the creature to take him out (his wife - who just gave birth - had more balls than he did even his daughter who actually figured out their weakness and was able to help kill the creatures, had more balls than he did) ... None-the-Less, it's quite entertaining and worth having a watch if you like slow, stupid men and believe in women power ...",7,1,1,6 October 2018
