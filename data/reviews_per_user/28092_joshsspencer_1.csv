Blade Runner 2049," Wonderful imagery but overly long and vague
","This movie came highly recommended by a friend, but it unfortunately did not live up to expectations. While the cinematography was excellent and the portrayal of the future dystopia highly believable, this did not make up for a slow-moving plot in which many details were unclear. At 2 hours and 44 minutes, the movie seemed to drag, and to make matters worse, the ending was anticlimactic. Also, despite watching several scenes multiple times and reading up on the plot afterwards, many elements still remained unclear to me. The storyline is simply insufficiently fleshed out and leaves the viewer desiring more. From an acting standpoint, the performances were good, but taken overall, the film itself also only reached 'good' rather than the superb I was hoping for and expecting.",6,4,6,11 June 2018
