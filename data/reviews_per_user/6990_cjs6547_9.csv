Blade Runner 2049," Certainly Beautiful, but What Else?
","This film is breathtaking in its slow minimalist artistic shots combined with a wonderful soundtrack, and it knows it. It works that to its advantage, like a beautiful bimbo at a Las Vegas strip club, but 2 hours and 40 minutes are a bit of a stretch to spend in that company. You soon realize that there's little else beneath the surface, that your mind is always at least one step ahead of the plot instead of trying to keep up with it, and that the film is using cheap emotional tactics which is a real shame considering they weren't necessary in the 1980's. The real shame is when you realize that the 1980's version holds its ground even when it comes to cinematography.The first hour and a half are devoted to invoking empathy for the subservient existence of new replicants. At some point it's a bit too in-your-face, and any intelligent audience would agree that here in 2017 we shouldn't need constant reminders about why dehumanizing humanoids is painful. From then we take painfully slow steps to uncovering the single mystery our replicant is in charge of. It is disappointing how many missed opportunities there are for a true, multicultural, futuristic, populous society and some fast, wowing action scenes. Our protagonist is - granted - a simple guy, but with exquisitely prehistoric tastes in his ladies (read 40's doting housewives). I think suggesting that even the most under educated of males would desire that type of partner in the 2020's is setting women's lib behind a lot. I am all for equality, and a man is free to desire a dumb slave if that is what he wants, but the protagonist of this franchise and in a romantic way? Hell no. Also, I do not recall any scenes where he is mingling with a multicultural crowd or even if there are more than one flying cars in the environment, which is an outright sin.Being a recent devotee of cyberpunk, I wanted to love this film. I wanted to feel the leap we have made in 3 decades. The leap, however, seems to be entirely superficial, with maximum focus on the visuals and sound, and otherwise assuming that your audience are a bunch of pre-pubescent kids who need everything spelled out for them and long periods without fast action to huddle and whisper about the plot. I have set up the original Blade Runner in my DVD player now, and am buckled up for an actual good time.",5,4,9,13 October 2017
Train to Busan," An entertaining instance in an otherwise dead genre
","I am not a fan of Zombie movies, like some of the other reviewers on here, which says a lot about the entertainment and production value of Train to Busan when I can safely say I thoroughly enjoyed it.It's nice to see Zombies away from that post-apocalyptic urban setting where most of them would be in dark alleyways or lurking in abandoned apartments. Here we are in a train with a bunch of likable and memorable characters as the zombie outbreak happens, and there's little suspense but plenty of quick action in each scene. This is again an accomplishment since quick sequences of action one after the other is harder to get right without leaving mistakes for the audience to point out.That doesn't mean this movie doesn't resort to many zombie tropes, in the sort of way that makes you think it is consciously doing so. But that's all fun and good. The fast, bone cracking zombie acrobats are also captivating.For me, it's biggest accomplishment would be to put so much emotion and meaning in the death of one character at a point in the film when most of the audience would be desensitized to death. Yes, this movie was the first in a LONG time to make me tear up. So, whether you like Zombie movies or not, give Train to Busan a try. It may not be entirely logical, but its good fun and easy on the eyes.",8,1,3,22 December 2016
Moana," Too Mainstream to Be Memorable
","Apparently, a lot of effort HAS gone into this animation of Polynesian folklore and it has all the elements kids these days have come to expect from Disney movies: 3D animation, wide-eyed characters bumbling around or talking like hip kids are 'supposed' to talk, the hero and his/her pet, and an adventure that makes use of the aforementioned 3D animation because its clear the character design isn't! So what's wrong with it?Well, nothing you can put your finger on right away. I've enjoyed old Disney flicks and recent ones equally - Inside Out being one of the most recent that I've liked, and I've got to say, this movie was a bit boring. That's surprising considering how the characters all seem to run about and pull faces, but then again that's the DUMB way to captivate your audience. The smart way is to establish an atmosphere that gives the story it's own identity, and this movie doesn't do that.The first few minutes with Moana growing up in the village reminded me of Pocahontas, and I couldn't help but feel how everything in THAT particular movie roped me in to the world the story was trying to create, and did so very well. The music, the sound effects, the art, the way the characters spoke, everything BREATHED life into the story of the Native Americans, gave the story identity, and made it incredibly, incredibly enticing. I've heard Disney's been trying to diversify its repertoire of animated films, but with Moana, it hasn't succeeded. There was no real charm or identity breathed into the Polynesian characters. Our heroine's dialogue and delivery matches that of a teenager in 2016, not of the era she's supposed to live in. With Moana, Disney is just going through the motions to try to sell something colorful and 'diverse', and looking at general reception, it has succeeded. I however, am not convinced.",5,11,29,14 December 2016
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Not for the average adult
","If you just want to watch this movie because its 8.5 and on IMDB's top 250, then stop right there. You will be baffled. Even if you appreciate the style as a change of pace of some sort, character depth and development is severely lacking, and the dialogue comes from the 8-ball of kid's screen writing.On the other hand, if you're a kid, you'll probably find this very imaginative and fantastic, and it is, for that target audience. Even if you are a hardcore comic book fan, I can see this thrilling you.",5,20,35,30 March 2019
Toy Story 4," Best film of the year
","I'm too old to have cried as much as I did watching this movie. There is so much well written humor, but also well written introspective dialogue and subtlety for people who grew up with the series.It is an excellent movie for adults, and the best film of the year in my opinion. Sure, it has the benefit of characters that have been fleshed out over the span of 3 movies, but it does something new and beautiful with them. You will see Woody's growth, and sympathize with him as you have never sympathized with him before. This has set a new, and frankly ridiculously high standard for animated sequels.",10,2,3,12 November 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Beautifully shot and acted, but something's missing
","This film is masterfully shot, and everyone gives an amazing performance, above and beyond expectations. The runtime passed in the blink of an eye, and while that speaks for the enjoyable experience you'll have as a viewer, that also means the end credits were somewhat unexpected.Tarantino does not disappoint with the direction or production, but something's missing. The great big denouement feels unusually abrupt and civilized. There are plenty of punches thrown, but none of the protagonists ever seem to be in any real danger. I'm not one for gritty gore, but I expected them to go on more of a life-changing journey. Maybe in the final scene, the antagonists are unable to portray the degree of threat and menace that would push it the extra mile, but that's just my guess.Still an entertaining way to spend 2 hours and 30 minutes.",7,1,3,5 November 2019
Joker," Captivating
","A real, raw and painfully guileless performance by Joaquin Phoenix contrasts with the captivating theatrics of Heath Ledger, and while the late actor achieved a beautiful onscreen presence, Phoenix delivers a new, memorably intimate take on the Joker.The story itself detaches from the usual comic book shenanigans and takes a serious, melodramatic route, which pointedly negates the black-and-white nature of good and evil. It's always tricky to try to garner sympathy for a villain by drawing on the tragedies in their past, but I think Joker safely accomplishes this, leaving us all conflicted. Some questions are answered in ways that leave the viewer unsatisfied and suspicious - a clever tactic to make each of us decide who we choose to believe.The direction and cinematography make this a captivating experience. Sudden events will elicit an awkward smile, while the rest is simply portentous and tragic.",9,4,6,5 November 2019
Mary and Max," The movie I go to when I need a good cry
","Don't get me wrong, I avoid tragic movies like the plague. Nothing puts me off more than watching the ills of society in gritty detail on the silver screen. Even so, once I started watching this movie, it pulled me in like a close friend I had known for all my life, and told me to let my tears flow and be content.It's hard to explain what makes Mary and Max different from other tragedies or tragicomedies. For a start, while it is geared up visually and with a soundtrack guaranteed to generate tears, it does not milk emotions in a cheap way. The narration is delivered in simple factual sentences with some tongue-in-cheek humor. The characters are ALL complex, interesting and very human, and there is no entity that is entirely negative or a source of hate or contention. Instead, the source of the troubles of our protagonists are their own internal struggles as they stumble through life stages, trying to find happiness. I don't want to spoil what happens, because everyone should see this movie at least once. While the subject matter is definitely for adult audiences, its innocence and good will makes it a very comforting watch.",10,0,1,15 October 2017
Annihilation," Not impressive
","This might have worked as a romantic drama with a bit of adventuring, but the sci-fi and horror are all wrong.A team of some women volunteer to go into the shimmer, a bubble that is spreading around a lighthouse. I say 'some women' because they have no clear objective, roles, chain of command, discipline, or in most cases, even mental strength to be there. Odd considering the shimmer is under strict military police observation, and they go so far as to hunt down a dying man in an ambulance because he emerged from the shimmer.The characters are not memorable. They have no distinct personalities, just different levels of losing their s***, ranging from fragile mind to mind-already-broken-so-not-going-to-emote. None of them are likeable or have any discernible motivation to be there. They don't talk about their research, seem fascinated in the world around them, or say anything at ALL of interest. I think they say 'I don't know' 50 times in the movie. What an inspiring bunch! One of the women comes up with a theory that doesn't make any sense, and then immediately gives up. At some point they decide they are losing their minds by literally saying they are losing their minds or 'changing' or something. They literally didn't have the direction or ability to ACT it, so they just say it.The movie is shot poorly. 90% of my screen was black during night scenes. This means they only need a fraction of the budget for nighttime monsters and action scenes. I get the feeling they're going to stop shooting night scenes at some point all together and just leave audio on a black screen.The ending looks like someone's project in a special effects class. Most of it does actually. The director was probably enamored with cell division at the time and made a movie with multiple shots of cell division scattered throughout with about 5 minutes worth of research on Google. They say this movie was dumbed down because test audiences didn't like it? What an insult to past and present audiences!",2,3,5,16 March 2019
