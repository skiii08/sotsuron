The Blair Witch Project," waste of time , money and effort
","except for the fact that I guess this movie was an original idea back in 1999 this movie wouldn't have lasted. This is such an awful movie , some whiny stoner's who get drunk and high than go in the woods , they start interviewing people and OK I mean it added story or dept but nothing keeps you interested , people vanishing and really the satires of this keep it pop cultural or relevant however you want to put it like in shows and movies like Undergrads which played briefly on MTV and Teletoon and Scary movie 1 this is such a forgetful movie.we never see any bad guys , villains , ghosts ...anything, Heather is probably the only reason everyone watched this for more than 10 minutes and everyone is very forgetful. I have no idea how this movie did so well and people say its such an incredible movie I think I spent more time laughing at it than anything, this makes Tommy Wiseau and The Room look like Oscar or academy award winning material. I would never recommend this , I would have walked out if it wasn't being streamed on my computer but me and my friend spent more time laughing at this movie than anything. The creators cannot pay me enough to recommend it, I want my hour and 20 minutes plus all the time writing this review back. 0 / 10 , anyone who rates higher especially critics where paid or have no life.",1,2,5,24 November 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," same old junk
",visually this movie was amazing. The little raccoon guy and groot looked very real and i laughed a few times. It was interesting for the movie score they used of all these 1970s-ish funk tunes when the guy put his Walkman on.BUT............We get a 'Star' studded cast of C and D list actors/actresses oh and Vin diesel we're in for a treat he should go back to racing cars in the fast and the furious franchise. Sure Tom Cruise or someone every drooling idiot knows has to be in a movie to be good. BUT It's too long the story is the same old crap year after year as if we're renting our movie tickets. Seriously why not be the bad guy and destroy a galaxy or two and watch him slaughter a bunch of people and focus on that.I wouldn't give this movie past a 4 star. It doesn't deserve the current 8.9 though. 5 is watchable and if it wasn't for who I went with I would have walked out. I barely watch TV so this is an honest without any brainwashing hype review.,3,58,129,3 August 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," I'd gve it a 0 / 10 .. but..
","Congratulations people who got out of the house and paid people money for this. This is a watered down kiddie rip off of James Bond movies you could get in the bargain bin of a walmart.The visual effects were good, the gadgets and to some degree the scenes like escaping out of the water to test the 'agents' or driving backwards flipping the cops off was the only interesting parts. This movie tries to be edgy. Any other training place I can imagine if he didn't shoot the puppy he would have been kicked out. During World War 2 in 1933 to get your stripes you had to break a German sheppard dogs neck in front of your superior officer. Not all nazi solders had to do this but it raises a good point. This movie at first has the atmosphere or feeling of the first harry potter movie or a crappy spy kid like movie and it fails miserably at being edgy like the boy and the princess near the end but it doesn't save this movie much. The visuals and a few scenes save this from a 1 star. I think the best actor was Samuel L. Jackson as only him and knife foot girl were the only two I'll remember years from now as you can't get any more unoriginal than our hero and the guy who gets shot in the face by Samuel L. Jackson. God I suck with names.I Saw this on the weekend and didn't know anything about it. So no WOWWW hype to get an honest opinion. The script was so predictable and unoriginal it makes you wonder if they should have paid people to write this.ways for this movie to improve .. it's hopeless we needed cellphones and internet to be what would kill us? whats next a movie about how facebook becomes a serial killer and causes our monitor to eat us? The people who wrote this movie I'd blacklist from Hollywood production teams and hire some people who are older than 23 to write this. This shouldn't have been made. Ian Flemming (James Bond creator) would be spinning in his grave over this steaming pile of dog crap. I'm not a hardcore james bond fan boy I've seen 4 or 5 of the movies tops but forgetful kids like the buster brady (mrs browns boys) rip off that kid was, was about as likable or I got about as emotionally involved with him as I did with the abusive father in this movie, the baby acted better too.Don't spend people money on this atrocity.",3,4,11,9 March 2015
