Alien: Covenant," Why didn't they give Neill Blomkamp the Chance?????
","I didn't go into the movie with high hopes. But still had some, regarding the story. oh my was I disappointed. Even though I had chosen Imax and lowered my hopes. I was truly dissatisfied. I think the movie was well casted. Especially female lead and Danny McBride whom I love. I think Michael Fassbender was to old to play the perfect robot. Otherwise the cast was perfect. The settings and Cgi was also great. But the story and characters. I Mean ... how stupid ... so stupid.... speechless. read some of the other dissing reviews. There is no need to repeat them here. I agree on all. I give it a 3 for the casting and the settings/Scenery/Photography. Everything else is disturbing bad. Especially when you consider Ridley had a second try from the horrible Prometeus and is so experienced a director. But... alas...he didn't learn and has just gotten to old. Anyway! The Alien saga always had a new innovative director at the helm. The first 4 at least. Why give it back to an old and outdated director. Neill Blomkamp should have gotten the chance. I am sure he would have created something fascinating and intelligent. Because Alien Covenent is anything but intelligent! The story is just stupid and uninspiring. Unless Ridley wanted to kill the saga and did it on purpose. There is no excuse. Since Ridley is a seasoned director with a solid reputation. There can really only be one person to blame. Ridley must have had the final saying in the movie process and therefore can only be the one to blame for the terrible and utter mess this screenplay was filmed. utter utter crap. The end.",1,7,14,5 June 2017
