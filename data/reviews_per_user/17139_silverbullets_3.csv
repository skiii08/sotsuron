The Avengers," What's $200 million without a good story?
","What an utter disappointment. Expected so much more substance from Joss Whedon. With so many great characters w/ great stories, you'd think the writers could have put together a good story. But no--that's not what obscenely budgeted films with the sole purpose of setting up a franchise care most about. Everyone's already pointed out all the ridiculous plot problems, so I'll just say that the writers had NO excuse when there's an entire comic series worth of stories to supply all they needed to work things out. A waste of some decent actors and lots and lots of money. (Pretty clear that the only moment Samuel Jackson actually enjoyed was when he got to walk out and blow up one of the jets. He looked bored or in pain for every other mediocre line.) I enjoyed most of the witty one-liners...and that's about it. Shallow on so many levels...who cares how shiny the CG was or how many things got blown up? The studio may have raked in disgusting amounts of cash based on the hype (and the promise of a great story), but will anything else about this film be memorable? Can't see how Stan Lee would have been pleased...",Null,7,14,20 October 2012
Constantine," It's all about The Balance.
","My misuse of the 10/10 is all about Keeping the Balance (said in best Keanu voice).It seems a certain rabid Hellblazer fan has attempted to spread the non-luv with a zillion reviews saying the same thing about how this ruined the comic and how Keanu is a moron. I totally understand adaptation-disappointment and sympathize. (But come on, give me a break. But it seems that hundreds of people have fallen for these cookie-cutter reviews...unless it's the same person making their neg reviews popular?) Regardless, I think in this case, you have to take the film as it is and not focus so much on comparing it to Hellblazer. Comic/graphic novel adaptations always come out different--they're two totally different visual mediums (there's a good reason Alan Moore doesn't want to do screenplays for adaptations of his books), and I think filmmakers need to be cut some slack for just trying to make a good movie that works on all levels. I think Francis Lawrence and crew (particularly the DP, editor, and production designer) have done an extraordinary job in adapting the medium, even though some Hellblazer fans might fault the adaptation of the content. It's tough to translate the hyperbolic normal of a comic bk world in film--it's a fine line between cheesy and cool when on the screen. But I felt they kept the balance quite impressively. Every moment that had the potential to cross the melodrama-cheese line suddenly cut to something normal/humorous enough that kept it all in amazing balance. In other words, they made that world believable enough to draw you into the story. And aside from the wasp-demon's face (the one bad egg), the CG was great. There's a ton of it, but it doesn't feel that way; it was generally very organic and melded into the fabric of the production design.With said fine line (between cheesy & cool) in mind, the acting was great for the most part (and I disagree with Mr. Write-a-zillion-reviews/Enemy-of-all-that-is-Keanu--I think this was one of Honsou's more unimpressive performances--he sounded like he was reading his lines). It's why I think Keanu, for all the bashing he gets, is really a rather good actor on average. A hell of a lot easier to do scenes where you don't have to talk about dragon-breath and fight with halfbreed CG characters and make melodrama believable--and just play an ordinary character in the ordinary world like our more celebrated celebs are so often celebrated for doing. I found his of Constantine to have depth--not so simple to interpret when your character is a guarded, solitary, hardened person. Despite the fact that the Matrix comparisons are the first to be thrown around, I'm thinking that casting Keanu for the role was equally, if not more about his performance in The Devil's Advocate. (Which was one of his better films, methinks. Actually, I thought there were some similarities in terms of how these films dealt with supernatural horror elements--it's an accomplishment to make those elements legit and powerful enough without the gratuitous creepiness that makes a lot of typical horror obnoxious/manipulative/cheap...IMO, of course.) And back to the script and directing--I felt it was solid all the way through. Deleted scenes say a lot for a director--it's praiseworthy when every one of them would've really hurt (or even ruined) the film as a whole and got scrapped, re-shot, or heavily re-edited. I'm impressed with Francis Lawrence, who didn't have mounds of experience, but really crafted a satisfying, intricately balanced (heh-heh), non-clich√© story out of all the elements at hand--and even more so as the subject matter (heaven/hell, evil, salvation, etc) is a heavy and delicate one.This is an adaptation that works in capturing the spirit of a very broad, layered story medium and crafting it into a more compact yet more visually-layered story medium. I really hate that I listened to the din of purists (and all those who like to parrot/regurgitate the 'wooden' Keanu diss...'wooden'? Come on.) and didn't catch the film in the theater. This one's a keeper.",Null,0,6,4 August 2007
Defiance," A disappointing waste of an interesting story
","I'd heard an interesting interview w/ Zwick on NPR and thus, looked forward to this film. The reality was utterly disappointing. I couldn't believe how unconvincing and uninvolving it was. But I never was drawn into the story and few of the characters were compelling as they so easily could have been, were the script even a bit better. I watch a lot of foreign films, so I'm usually the last to say a film is boring b/c it's slow--instead, I'd say the poor script, uneven acting, and terrible casting is what did it in. I felt somehow cheated of my $10 when the credits rolled.Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell, who are both excellent actors, did well with what they were given--in fact, I would have found Schreiber more convincing in the lead role, and it's sad that he didn't get the role due to Daniel Craig's star power being so heavily counted on for the marketing of this film. Craig was, instead, a casting mistake in more ways than one: no WAY could he pass as Schreiber's brother--I know the real Tuvia was supposed to look more white than the others, but I've seen his real photo, and not only did he resemble his brothers--he didn't look even CLOSE to Aryan!) Still, in spite of their commendable efforts to make the often-cheesy script work, the poor choice to make the Jews from Poland and Belarus speak horribly-accented English while the Russians and Germans spoke their native languages was a disaster and hurt the actors' credibility--I thought that the rule of thumb is that you choose one or the other if you don't want to make your film come off as false.Worse, there was some spectacularly bad acting/lines--almost classic TLC/Hallmark movie stuff...i.e. cheesy choruses of 'I'll go.' 'Me too!' I'll go.' 'I will also go.' Or: 'I have a belt.' 'Me too!' 'I have a belt, too.' 'Take my belt!' The screenwriters also failed many opportunities to develop the other characters, which almost all came off as two-dimensional and sometimes even fake. All the story potential to create moving drama was wasted.The script stalled and meandered, and failed to make us invest more in the characters. Mediocre photography also didn't help. All this without the fact that there was a ton of tinkering done with the actual historical accounts of these events. The more controversial inaccuracies aside, I still think the melodramatizing and sensationalizing of the story really was a disservice to those who actually lived through it (regardless of whether the brothers were really womanizing bullies or not). Still, it seemed disingenuous to not say 'inspired by a true story' in the beginning--instead, now there a ton of people who are taking this Hollywood version as a documentary. Could go on and on, but this was so disappointing on so many levels that there's no point.",Null,11,21,24 January 2009
