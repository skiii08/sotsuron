The Expendables 2," This movie should never have been made
","Like the last movie the sequel is a bang-up job as well. The action scenes didn't look the part with saggy grandpas, the comedy didn't work either with forcible positioned dialogues. The first time it was understandable, everyone wants another go. These guys are old - end of their careers, they came together made a movie, they used all their old dialogues and tried to be funny. But lets be clear, the last movie had tainted the good work they had done 20 or so years ago.I had hoped they would stop then, but I am guessing the money is too good. Surely there are millions of others like me who would go to the theaters again to watch their childhood heroes again. It makes marketing sense (and only that) to make another installment. And they have got Van-Damme and Chuck Norris for this rubbish! Van-Damme is pathetic as a villain, and with Chuck Norris they do not even make that attempt at his past glory. I mean, a kid who knows Chuck Norris through just this movie would be left wondering about all the Chuck Norris jokes. I am deeply disappointed, and hope there isn't a third installment brewing",3,1,3,21 October 2012
