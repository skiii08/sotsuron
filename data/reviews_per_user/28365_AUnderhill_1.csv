The Blair Witch Project," Unique, ingenious, terrifying, creepy - See it!!!
","Great premise, very original and unique presentation.  This was the first film I've ever seen where the entire audience was completely silent during the entire film.  I saw people leaning forward in their chairs, faces glued to the screens.  I saw people leave with full bags of popcorn because they were so engrossed that they forgot where they where and what they were doing.  I saw someone throw-up, (don't sit in the front row or you may face motion-sickness too).  My friends said they had to take sleeping agents the night they saw it just to get to bed. All in all, go see it!",10,1,2,19 July 1999
