The Blair Witch Project," if it's a headache you're looking for...
","This film, though very original, was a big disappointment. The story line was very boring, the 'effects' were barely there, and the horror part of the film the film makers were trying to get across never happened. This 'film' was too predictable and you could see the ending coming a mile away. Another major downside to the film was the constant back and forth swaying of the camera, true this was supposed to be a documentary but after 15 minutes into the film I had to look away for a few minutes to focus on something that wasn't constantly moving a 100mph! I walked away with a headache and 4.50 poorer. Don't go see this one folks, don't even wait till it comes out on video. Here's an indication that a great deal of other people have the similar opinion as I do...I when to try to see it on opening night, it was sold out an hour before it was supposed to start. So I go the next day buy my tickets in advance and when I do go to see it I have no problem finding a good seat with no one in front of me, hmmmmm...could it be that after the majority of die hard film fans saw the very same movie as I was about to see and then after clearly seeing that it was a complete joke told everyone else the same? I think so, it's just too bad that one of them didn't get back to me in time.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
