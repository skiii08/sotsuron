Antz," Excellent graphics, innovative idea, and today's subject
","Excellent graphics which makes the movie outgoing, very good cast of voices for the movie characters. Bright new idea. The subject of the movie relates to our everyday life and reflects very well the diversity of personalities in our biosphere, as it sometimes enhances the concept of individualism vs. totalitarism.",7,0,0,27 December 1998
