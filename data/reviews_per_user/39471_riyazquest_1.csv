The Avengers," Awesome movie
",I am from India so I don't have much of the comic book reading experience which others from US have. But I've been waiting for this movie for over an year now. I have read so many reviews and saw so many Trailers of this movie before actually going to the movie I felt like I watched 90% of the movie. But when I actually saw this movie it blew me away. First and Foremost kudos to Whedon for a wonderful masterpiece. Screenplay was extra ordinary and the way he put all those powerful characters in one frame was simple brilliant. I don't know why but I always thought Iron Man will be like the central character of the movie. But it was great to see HULK made a big impact than any other character. I saw the UK Press conference where Mark Ruffalo said that he was the first person to act both Bruce and Hulk. It was simply amazing. I have never seen such a huge audience and rush for a English movie in so long after Avatar than I've seen today. If you haven't watched it yet. Do not waste any time. These type of movies come only once in a lifetime.,10,3,8,27 April 2012
