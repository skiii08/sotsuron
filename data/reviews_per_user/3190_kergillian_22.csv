Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Quentin Tarantino is a special director!
","Anyone can film a remake. A tribute. Revamped stories. Ripoffs films. Etc. All been done many times, and rarely well.What makes Tarantino's films - especially the Kill Bill films - so special is that while there are co many aspects that pay tribute to cinematic history, they are only ASPECTS of the film. Tarantinos' film-making is poetry - he does not rely on one genre or another, one style or another, one film or another. He is able to thank all of his own muses individually, while remaining a unique screenwriter and director with something important to say on screen. Characters that would otherwise be ridiculous, actors that are often sub-par, dialogue that could be boring as hell - he brings it all to LIFE in a way that VERY FEW directors are capable of doing. He is a Kurosawa, an Attenborough, a Spielberg of our time - a true cinematic artist. And in thirty years, when everyone forgets that The Alamo or Hidalgo ever existed, Kill Bill will be regarded by film fans and scholars alike as one of the very best of its era - and will likely be paid tribute by the dynamos of the future just as Tarantino gives a salute to his idols.",8,2,4,25 March 2005
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Better than I remembered, but still overrated.
","I haven't seen this film since the late eighties at least, perhaps not since around the time it came out. And I must admit it was better than I expected. I didn't watch the new remastered director's cut that just came out recently, but instead borrowed the original, to see it as it was (I'm not really interested in cut scenes, etc.)The effects were vintage ILM, very nice for the time. E.T. looks pretty impressive, even by today's standards it isn't at all bad. Drew Barrymore is adorable, and I liked the older brother. In fact, Elliott is the only character that annoys me, with his shrieking and whining constantly...I admit, I'm fairly prejudiced against anyone younger than 14 in a film (as I rarely see any character at that age that isn't nauseatingly precious or irritating as heck) and this kid was no exception.Scenes that stood out in my mind include the wonderful frog rescue scene, and the classic bike rides (especially the chase one). But unfortunately, I feel the film drags on much too long, and the entire illness stretch just seems to go on forever. The government agents also seem rather unbelievable as well as overly inept and less covert thatn I think they should be. Though this is a children's film, so some silliness and suspension of disbelief is necessary. Still, as a whole I think the film is overrated. Great for kids (though not too young - I can see young children easily frightened by certain scenes), and heartwarming, some cool effects and a message for all about friendship and loyalty is strongly apparent. But still, a bit too silly at times, and the length gets tedious a bit towards the end. Great to watch, but I don't think it's the masterpiece many claim it to be. 7/10.",7,3,5,26 May 2002
Wayne's World," Ten years later, not really dated, still full of laughs!!
","On one hand, it's all been done before (see: Excellent Adventure, Bill and Ted's) but on the other hand, great writing by Mike Myers and hilarious skit acting by both Myers and Dana Carvey make this film really funny. It has its ups and downs, but in the end it's a tongue-in-cheek, often satirical laugh-fest. And it gets done without a need for overly juvenile humour (although it is there;)What really bothers me is Tia Carrere's acting. What bothers me more is Tia Carrere's (?) singing (if it's her) And Rob Lowe's wooden acting doesn't help much either. If Myers and Carvey weren't so good, Carrere and Lowe would bring this film much deeper into comedy hell.This film spawned classic scenes; the Bohemian Rhapsody scene, the hockey scene, the studio' show scene (great product placement;). But overall it lacks something that even humour can't pull past. It simply works better in skit-form, one thing that Bill and Ted's definitely surpasses Wayne and Garth in is that it flowed more smoothly from beginning to end without lapses. Still, there are enough laughs to keep this one out of the gutter, and most of the other SNL based movies can't claim that (most shouldn't even *exist*)Look for great cameos by Meat Loaf, Alice Cooper, Donna Dixon, Ed Al Bundy' O'Neil, Blackhawks great Stan Mikita and Ione Skye, plus a hilarious and different role from starlet Lara Flynn Boyle.Overall: well worth watching, and has so far stood the test of time. An easy 7/10.",7,1,3,17 April 2001
Coffee and Cigarettes," More complex than it's given credit for...
","This film has been too easily dismissed as a 'silly film', a 'boring film', a film that is 'lean on plot'...I think that many of the critics of this film have simply missed the point. This film is NOT about plot, action, slapstick or any of the other mainstream, blockbuster ideas that have filtered into our minds as the 'right' way to shoot a film. Have we become so Pavlovian that our films must hit every clichéd moment and provide us with frenzied pacing, and non-stop action, sight gags and toilet humour?This film is filled with layers - complex ideas and connections between the vignettes that are masked by a surface that SEEMS shallow, but when you look at it a bit, LISTEN to the dialogue and think about what the actors are saying (or not saying) you'll realize that the characters, and the vignettes, are offering a little more than banal coffee-talk.This isn't Jarmusch's best film, but it's certainly one of his most interesting, and the film's layers of complexity began to hit me as I had a post-film conversation.Two simple rules before you see this film:1) Don't expect a fast-moving, action-filled film. This film will seem agonizing to anyone who has no patience for quality, dialogue-heavy films that are about what's being said rather than what's being blown-up.2) Don't go see this if you don't like Jim Jarmusch, Hal Hartley, Richard Linklater, Allison Anders, Audrey Wells, Atom Egoyan - or any filmmaker who focuses on complex ideas, ignore Hollywood mainstream, and doesn't often concern themselves with 'plot' or 'story' as much as 'idea' and 'film'There is a high level of irony in Coffee and Cigarettes, a message apparent within the vignettes that one should dig deeply beyond the surface of things and into what someone or something is really saying. Looking at the Steve Coogan/Alfred Molina vignette, the double-Cate vignette, and the Renée vignette, this message is abundantly clear. As well, there is a deep connection between many of the vignettes - bits of dialogue, and of event, that are drawn together through the philosophy of Tesla (whom Jarmusch adores) and through the final, touching 'Champagne' vignette.Some of the vignettes are a little rough - the original Benigni/Wright SNL vignette for example, and the Twins vignette as well. But they hold up as a nice and light introduction to the film, which beings to get much more complex as more and more is said to us. This allows the viewer to ease into the film more capably, than if we were forced into the more poignant scenes from the beginning.In the end, there are some flaws in this film; and not every vignette is superb, but viewers who take the time to look past the surface should truly enjoy the experience. 7.5/10.",7,1,3,25 March 2005
Constantine," A Hell of a Film!
","A fun-filled and exciting adaptation of the comic. If you're a purist, you'll hate it - but for those of us who can appreciate something without it having to be an exact replica down to the letter, it is a film worth exploring.This is not the first film that seemed doomed when it was relocated from England to the States. High Fidelity is one of my all-time favourite novels. When I heard that they set it in Chicago, I nearly flipped - I mean, being in England is central to the book! I sensed that the relocation would completely ruin the novel. Then I saw the film. I should have known that any film Stephen Frears directs and John Cusack stars in would have a hard time being awful. High Fidelity is one of my absolute favourite films.Constantine isn't directed by Frears, and Reeves is no Cusack, but when I heard it was relocated from England to LA and that Reeves was J.C., who had become a cop along the way, I kept an open mind. I knew from experience that change could be good. You have to remember that the average film-goer is not a comic fan, and few of them have read the comic. While purists will curse and moan about the changes, those making the film have to keep the film interesting to a mass audience while trying to retain as much of the essence of the comic as possible. They did a damn good job here. It's not the best film I've seen, but it was a fair adaptation, it was exciting to watch, and it had a tight script which was well-shot and well-adapted. Considering the director is a first-timer who had previously only shot videos, it's actually quite impressive. Only David Fincher and Spike Jonze have ever really made the crossover successfully (and with talent for film-making), so it's not often we see a film as well constructed as this by a video director.Keanu Reeves is exciting to watch - especially in films where he really enjoys himself. You can tell that he really likes playing this character. Unfortunately. he is stuck with a voice that simply cannot change - like Sly Stallone and Vin Diesel, Keanu has the voice that will forever sound the same. In Dangerous Liaisons everyone complained that he sounded like Ted, here everyone complains he sounds like Neo. But once you get past the surface, you'll see a rich character portrayal, with an intensity and discomfort that Neo never really had. He can't shake his voice - which will always be that of Ted Theodore Logan - and now will always have pieces of Neo in it. But those who know the comic should be impressed with the way he carried himself - his poses, his body language, they really reflected the J.C. we know and love.Rachel Weisz is as sultry as ever, and what an interesting performance by Tilda Swinton - who opens up all forms of questions with her androgynous characterization of Gabriel. The sexless angel - or multi-sexual angel - brings an interesting level of interpretation of heaven and divine intention to the film.Djimon Hounsou and Pruitt Taylor Vince each performed fantastically, as is expected of actors of their calibre. If Keanu had intensity, they blew intensity off the map.But not as far as Peter Stormare did, as a perfect Satan. Part playboy, part psychopath - his eyes had that same look they did in Fargo...something in them that says 'you don't want to look here, go away. NOW!'And was that Gavin Rossdale I saw as Balthazar?? If he only sang as well as he acts, Bush might have been a half-decent band... All in all, this is not the best film of the year, but it certainly beats most of the other films out there at the moment. With a plethora of second-rate horror films and really awful video game movies, it's nice to have a seat-of-your-pants horror/suspense/ adventure film to fall back on. Slow at times, when it's on, it's ON - and it's very impressive to look at. Not for the stubbornly purist, but for anyone looking for an entertaining, quality film, I recommend it, 7.5/10",8,0,4,27 March 2005
Insomnia," A good watch
","I went in with no expectations - I have yet to see Memento so I have nothing good or bad to say about Christopher Nolan, and although Robin Williams usually annoys the hell out of me, from the trailers for this film I figured that this character wouldn't be his usual over-manic obnoxious self.I was impressed over all. While not the best film I've seen this year, it's pretty high up. Some gorgeous cinematography (being filmed in rural Alaska didn't hurt this film at all!) although at times the occasional lack of focus and rapid cuts started to get irritating and detracted from the point they were supposed to be making.Aside from the unfortunate casting of Hilary Swank; Martin Donovan is excellent as always, Robin Williams is in his best role since the Fisher King, Al Pacino is Al Pacino (which is either good or bad, depending on whether you like Al Pacino;) and Maura Tierney is once again shamefully underused.Overall: a good film. Not great, but good, and definitely worth seeing. This won't garner any Oscars, but it shouldn't disappoint. 7/10.",7,0,0,22 May 2002
Hotel Rwanda," Welcome to the wonderful world of European colonization.
","Somalia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Congo, Sudan, Algeria, Nigeria, Tunisia - and Rwanda...what do all of these African counties have in common? They're countries torn apart by civil war, where millions have been slaughtered and millions more have been maimed, raped, beaten, tortured, threatened, displaced, and, most importantly, ignored by the rest of the world. And the main reason for the nightmare that Africa has become? Europe colonized Africa and divided it along new territorial lines, splitting tribes and clans into pieces, and forcing rivals and foreigners into the same territories. The entire Rwandan genocide is namely due to the Belgians, who basically handpicked certain Rwandans and called them Hutus, and called the others Tutsis, all arbitrarily, then left the country and power to the Hutus, creating a power struggle between two 'tribes' who were really the SAME PEOPLE.In the end you have Hutus and Tutsis at war, even though there is absolutely no difference between them save a name granted by their Belgian 'lords', and power unilaterally granted by uncaring and abandoning colonizers. I just watched the Shake Hands With The Devil documentary on Radio-Canada tonight, and one thing that astounded me was the footage, at the 10th anniversary conference on the Rwandan genocide, of a personal attack by the Belgian senatorial representative, on Dallaire, because of Belgian casualties within the UN peacekeeping corps. I think that this is the perfect example of where the Western priorities lie.Everyone in North America and Western Europe needs to see Hotel Rwanda. Only through this kind of film can we actually learn about and feel the sort of terror that exists in a land where death can come to someone simply because they're unfortunate enough to be branded with a colonial name that divides them from the Powers That Be. 10/10.",10,4,6,27 March 2005
Snatch," Much better than expected!!
","After all the criticism about how this was simply Lock Stock 2 and was generic and boring, I made sure to keep my expectations low. That turned out to be good advice, because it only made the movie that much sweeter! Okay, the style is similar, but it's an awesome style! Some of the cast members return, to similar roles even...but hey, Vinnie Jones is beyond cool, so who the hell cares if there are similarities (which seemed to be on purpose...) Even Brad Pitt was really good, which is so rare an occurrence that all should sit up and take notice (and his accent has drastically improved since the horrid display in The Devil's Own;) Another hilarious coincidence-ridden plot, another stellar cast, another fabulous Ritchie film. I'm now willing to see *anything* he directs. 9/10!",9,0,0,10 February 2001
Van Helsing," Better than expected, but hardly an epic...
","From the opening scenes, lifted straight from the classic Karloff Frankenstein, I could see the 'tributes' were beginning. And Sommers didn't disappoint, lifting bits from multiple films, from Star Wars and Indiana Jones to The Wolf Man and John Carpenter's Vampires.That aside, the film itself was, as a friend put it, a great popcorn film. Entertaining and witty, interesting effects and smooth cinematography. On the other hand, if you're expecting to see The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, check your expectations at the door, because this film is not nearly as clever or original as those films were.A couple of PROs: The Frankenstein monster's intelligence was a real plus. The one thing that always bothered me about the Karloff films was that the monster was purely animal and had no apparent non-instinctual intelligence. This monster reflects the book much more purely in character, as he becomes intellectual, and, essentially human.As well, I LOVED David Wenham in this (playing Carl). Those who know him only as Faramir in the LotR trilogy will be pleasantly surprised at his standout performance. Those who've seen some of the other films he's done, like Russian Doll, will be less surprised - though equally amused.CONs: The ending was LAAAAAAAAME!! I won't post spoilers, but the entire end sequence, after the resolution, was absolutely ridiculously awful. I DID like the resolution, though - although the Archangel Gabriel idea was only mildly over-the-top...IN THE END: this film is basically a better Dracula 2000, which was a film with a ton of potential and very poor follow-through. I suspect that most people will enjoy this film, but few will wish to see it a second time. A truly entertaining popcorn film. 6.5/10",6,0,1,25 March 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Wow oh wow oh wow!!!!
","Visually stunning!! This is my vote for film of the year, hands down! Chow, as always, was spectacular. Ang Lee has done it again!! The scenery is simply majestic, the acting, which could be oh so cheesy, was stupendous...time flies by, as fast as Michelle Yeoh on wires =) I recommend this movie to anyone who can read the subtitles! A Chinese fairytale masterpiece!!",10,0,0,3 January 2001
Kelly's Heroes," Amusing, well-scripted film with stellar cast!
","This film is really funny, with quirky characters, great dialogue and a *really* strong cast In fact, the cast sometimes saves this film from slipping into dreariness. A bit too long at 2h26, some scenes are simply unnecessary or too long. A good example is the General (a real waste of Carrol O'Connor's talents) A useless role, his scenes are all fairly useless, and could be pretty much wiped out of the film without changing it.Donald Sutherland is a standout here, nearly as good as his portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce in M*A*S*H; his hippie artillery leader named Oddball' is a hilarious role played to near perfection! Clint Eastwood also plays his role, title character Kelley, to near perfection. A strong, solid character who counters Telly Savalas' big lug Big Joe' and Sutherland's Oddball' quite nicely. Don Rickles plays Don Rickles, so few surprises there. And the supporters are there purely to support the main three, which works out well (look for Harry Dean Stanton 9 years prior to Alien).Considering it's not supposed to be taken seriously in the least, the impossibilities' in terms of characterization and certain props should be overlooked. There are some slightly glaring plot holes as well, but they don't really matter. This film is simply fun and should be enjoyed as such. 7/10.",7,1,2,30 April 2001
Mulholland Drive," The way The Lost Highway SHOULD have been done!
","I'd heard so many wonderful things about this movie, so my expectations were high, especially since I was really disappointed with the Lost Highway. And this certainly met my expectations, though I perhaps don't think it's quite as good as most of my friends do.David Lynch is certainly an acquired taste. And I've been hooked since I first saw Blue Velvet, which remains one of my all time favourite movies. And I was one of the many who was distraught when Twin Peaks ended (especially on such a frustrating note!!) This movie will definitely please the fans. it's cryptic, full of hidden clues and the inevitable Lynchian message about life and the world, and specifically in this film: Hollywood. And his commentary is strange, deep and at times hilariously wicked. The two scenes that particularly floored me were the assassination slapstick, Lynch style; and the Naomi Watts audition scene.However, the film had a tendency to get TOO cryptic. And I'm not talking about the Lost Highway type of character switch, but of the many scenes which didn't seem to have ANYTHING to do with the film, involving characters that didn't seem to fit in. Some explained themselves a little as the movie progressed (the assassin for example, though that hilarious aforementioned scene still didn't really make sense to me plot-wise), other never really did. And the very ending (which I won't spoil) was a real letdown for me, as Lynch seemed to be trying too hard with it, a sort of cheezy artsy ending that I haven't seen from him before except as satire.Still, this was a Lynch film, and a GOOD one. It was completely unpredictable, with great acting (check out Billy Ray Cyrus as the poolboy turned adulterer, Gene). And even if David Lynch's deep inner lesbian fantasies were a tad overdone, so be it (the scenes were at least really sensual and not plastic soft-core trailer trash). So although it's a bit too caught up in itself, the movie was a thrilling jumble of eerily connected pieces. It could have been connected JUST a bit more smoothly, but c'est la vie.  8/10.",8,0,1,26 May 2002
Mission: Impossible II," John Woo makes this film everything it is...
","If not for John Woo, this film would probably be quite horrid. The script needs *major* work, but the film works because of Woo's brilliance. Beautifully shot from end to end, this film survives on how gorgeous it is, and how amazing the action scenes are.The biggest problem with the film is the pacing. The first hour and change is slow and all background, then all of a sudden there's three huge fast-paced action sequences in less than an hour. In fact, the film only seems to get good about an hour in. Too much information is given, and the outcome is so predictable that I knew how it would end less than halfway through. Also, the romantic aspect was much too cheezy and seemed to not only go overboard (and I *hate* Hollywood endings! Should have had a Ronin ending...) but seems to have little relevance. And while we're at it, Billy's character needed more screen time and more importance considering he was supposedly a member of the 'team'. Actually, it didn't seem like much of a 'team', should have been more team oriented action. I though the first action sequence (invasion of chem company) should have happened much earlier, which could have set up the story in a more interesting way (oh, nice touch to have an almost identical drop as the first film). As it stands, I liked the climbing scenes (Iko Iko was a nice touch - exact same music as opened Rain Man...coincidence?? I think not;) I liked the attempted theft scene. However, the Hopkins scene was tedious (too long and poorly scripted) and the car chase was frivolous (gotta have those chase scenes!!) and the romantic scenes were simple a waste of time and film.The final two action sequences were vintage Woo however. The film picks up and *bam* great choppy repeat cuts, great stunts...and Cruise was *almost* convincing with that amusing martial arts/WWF kicking style...if only Ving Rhames had a bigger part...Overall: this film was snazzy. It had spit-and-polish but wasn't *too* glossy. And although I don't expect intellect from a M:I film of all things, at least it could have had a decent plot. But the classic Woo action scenes make up for it to a point; a single dove flying through the flames as Cruise walks by...visually stunning! 7/10.",7,2,4,8 April 2001
The Mummy Returns," Horrid script ruined a potentially fabulous film!
","As all sequels go, this wasn't as good as the first one. But it was still rather good. And had the potential to be *much* better! I *loved* the continuity from first to second. The continuing fragments of the story are wonderfully inserted here to add a strong feeling of connection between the first and second films. And the characterization continued to be wonderful (and thankfully, they didn't let the Rock act much;)But that said, there were many aspects that just plain ruined an otherwise clever story. The romance was just plain horrid. Not that it existed, rather the way it was handled. It just got sappy and cheezy with silly dialogue and ridiculous overtones. Not to mention we were hammered over the head with it. And I don't generally like brats in films like these (Temple of Doom perhaps being one of the few exceptions), and though this one was better than most (no incessant whining and screeching) he was still a bit out of place and was focussed on WAY too much. As well, John Hannah's antics were completely overdone this film...and Rachel Weisz wasn't clumsy enough.That side, the baddies were all amusingly well acted (great seeing Adewale in a role other than hardened criminal...oh...never mind;) I still think he's an amazing actor!) and I love the guy who plays Imhotep. But the pacing of the film (which started *really* well) got skewed about halfway through the film and the film started to suffer. Too many action scenes jammed into too short a period of time. They were all becoming generic (and rehashes of the first film), and how many cliffhanger 'He's going to die!! Quickly!! Grab him!!' scenes can one bear within a couple of hours??? The final John Hannah grab for the jewel had me rolling my eyes and begging for the bloody film to finish already! (and cartoon style action films are cartoon style action films, but it would be nice to see a good character in some actual pain and peril once in awhile or it simple becomes yawnable).Overall: I liked the film. I especially loved the continuity between films. And I look forward to The Scorpion King. But I hope that it's better scripted and lives up to its potential a bit more. 6/10.",6,0,0,22 May 2001
Hoosiers," A strong, feel-good movie
","This film is entertaining, well-written, and definitely one that will get you cheering for the team! The down-side is that it's at times melodramatic and overly-tear-jerking and uses almost every sentimental cliche ever written at least once. While there are some great lines ('God wants you on the floor, son') there are also some *horribly* cliched lines as well ('I've wanted to kiss you since the moment we first met!')Gene Hackman is fabulous in this, as the former college coach turned Navyman who comes to small town Hickory, IA to coach basketball. And being from Bloomington, I can vouch for the frenzied obsession we of Indiana have for basketball;), so it was no surprise to see how unwelcome he was in town with unorthodox methods and bing an outsider as well (always a good kicker for a plot). Add the loss of then best player in town, who decides not to play ball that year, and the challenge is on!But the plot slips away too much at times. The Dennis Hopper as an alcoholic former basketball star who is given a chance to be an assistant if he cleans up plotline could have been interesting; but his 'agonized' moments on the floor dragged on too much, and the plot turned sour when he relapsed, and was eventually discarded and never resolved properly (save for a sloppy and cheezy heartstrings moment where his son declares that they'll move in together when it's all over, -snif-snif-snif-). As well, the shameless and worthless attempt to inject romance into the film stuttered and failed...Barbara Hershey playing a colleague who the coach gets off on the wrong foot with and then falls for, is too typical and rated barely a glimpse or two in the overall story. Why bother?? It was a subplot that had absolutely nothing to do with the story, hardly had any screen time, and was never properly dealt with. It was just wasted screen time.Still, the film as a whole is worth the cheeziness of some parts. The ending is predictable, but in a heart-swelling way. Sure, some of the scenes are a bit too long and jerking, but in the end it doesn't matter because it just feels right. It's handled as well as possible, considering it has to be Hollywood, even in little Hickory. A solid film, could have been better, but not by too much. 7/10.",7,3,5,14 June 2001
Downfall," Possibly the most important film of the year...
","Hirschbiegel wanted to make sure that this film was directed by a German, and done right, so that the story was put forth cautiously and in the proper hands. It was heavily researched, and is based primarily on interviews with the sort of 'narration' character, a secretary to Hitler named Traudl Junge, who was 22 at the time, and was excused after the war, considered one of the 'young and innocent' - the youth who were caught up in the Nazi Machine without being considered 'at fault'. Excerpts of her interview make the perfect bookend to this film, as we enter and exit from the story with some powerful thoughts to process. It's also based somewhat on interviews with Albert Speer at Spandau, and shortly after he was released, and on a book by one of the world's foremost historians/researchers on the subject. It's aura is exhaustingly real, unbelievably intense. Even now, three days later, I'm still somewhat numb. This is definitely not Hollywood melodrama...This film is extremely important, because it forces us to realize that Hitler - along with everyone else surrounding him - was one of our species. It does not pull punches, and certainly doesn't make him sympathetic, doesn't 'humanize' him, and highlights his delusions to make sure there's no mistake about his mindset. But it's a film that forces us to realize that it was a human being who did this - who committed some of the worst crimes humanity has ever witnessed, and that is an eye-opener that some people, I think, need to have. Because if we simply dismiss Hitler as an inhuman monster rather and a human one, then we are trivializing the deaths of tens of millions of people, each of whom died in order for us to learn what human beings are truly capable of. 9/10.",9,9,15,28 March 2005
Trainspotting," Well done, but short of its potential...
","An excellent creative team, fabulous cast, great story...so what went wrong? A bit of a loaded question, because the film was still fantastic, even though it missed its mark. What went wrong is that the film could never compare to the book...and although I'm probably a bit biased due to an adoration of Irvine Welsh's writing (well...most of it;), the film really screwed a bit up too much to be forgiven. Having the original screenplay, I admit that it was partially due to time constraints...they cut a lot of scenes out that would have improved the film. But there was a lot that just shouldn't have been done.Let's start with Diane. Diane is unforgivable, as she's actually two characters combined into one. In the book Dianne was the high school girl Rents ended up sleeping with, but the girl he ended up with, who wrote to him in London, was another girl completely (Kelly?) And the way he ended up with Dianne was different, she was much less sharp tongued and much more naive, and the whole breakfast and post-breakfast scene was completely different.The second major beef I had was with the ending. In the book Rents stole the money with no qualms and no regrets. He didn't leave a cent for Spud and he didn't plan on giving up the skag and turning clean. He was going to heave off to France and live in a heroin paradise; not working and reverting to drugs.Thirdly, Tommy was much more bitter and dejected; he blamed Renton for his AIDS and was never able to deal with it properly.Finally, the entire reason for the title was dropped. The whole 'Trainspotting' scene has not even a mention in the film, not even a mention of Begbie's father...And then there's Rents' brother, who barely rates a glance in the film...A gripe I have about the film itself, is that some scenes are overdone, even useless. The scene where Renton kicks is horrid; the whole baby crawling across the ceiling/Spud in chains/Tommy as a haggard AIDS victim (though we don't even know he has it at that point) is just too much. And a waste of time. Definitely one scene that could have been sacrifice; or at least they could have found a better way to do it.And a lot of scenes were sloppy...much of the information that is essential to the story is given in passing, or we find out facts after they've been displayed. I think this is because of the shape the original script took, and the cuts seem to have harmed the story in a way that should have been repaired.But all that aside, the film was cast perfectly (Dianne aside, who shouldn't have really been as important to the film as she was, even). Jonny Lee Miller is the absolute perfect Sick Boy, and MacGregor is brilliant as Rents. Ewen Bremner is hilarious as Spud, especially in the job scene (the Renton half of that scene, which is missing from the film, is even more amusing;) and he also makes an appearance in the other Irvine Welsh film, The Acid House, which anyone who liked this film should go out and watch... Top off that cast with Robert Carlyle as an amazing Begbie, and Irvine Welsh himself popping in as Mikey, and we're all set.Overall: The errors and changes in the film don't really ruin it, but fans of the book may be disappointed somewhat. This film doesn't come close to Danny Boyle and John Hodge's previous effort, Shallow Grave, but it's still a fabulous film. Anyone who hasn't read the book will appreciate the film even more, and who could ask for a better cast?? All gripes aside, I still rate this an easy 8/10.",8,4,9,4 June 2001
The Truman Show," Better than I expected, but not as good as it could be.
","This is the first Jim Carrey film where he actually diverged from his industry-standard role. There were enough Carrey-isms to be mildly annoying, but not enough to ruin a decent film. The plot was really well-constructed. The acting was really quite good, especially Truman's wife and best friend, and Ed Harris brilliant job as the show's creator. And I really liked the 'set effects' that were used...especially the 'errors' that popped up now and then. The ending was overdone (don't look now, it's Hollywood!!), but ignoring the last 20 minutes or so, it was a well done film, even if it did star Carrey (can't well be perfect, can it?) 7/10.",7,0,0,12 February 2001
The Breakfast Club," It has its flaws, but they just can't hurt this wonderful film!
","This film brings me back to my high school days, being 15 and worrying about the most trivial of things. And this film is about how the most ordinary and banal of occurrences - being a virgin, failing a project, hating your parents, stupid jock pranks - can all seem so earth-shattering to the people they affect.This film should not be taken too seriously. It's mostly tongue-in-cheek, the dialogue is often purposefully overly cheezy, the characters are all stereotypes and aren't too deep. Even the teacher is an overdone caricature. But it all works. And the greatest part is that this film isn't dated at all...well, aside from the evil hair-styles and horrid 80s music (couldn't they have used *good* 80s pop?? I wish I *could* forget about the Simple Minds!!)Some of it is *too* cheezy..the horrid synth music that rises to a predictable crescendo whenever something dramatic happens being a good example. The silly make-over (which ends up uglifying Ally Sheedy...she looked *way* cuter in her 혩reject' form) and odd pairing of Sheedy and Estevez (where did *that* come from? All of a sudden. no prior hints, they're madly in love?? At least with Molly vs. Nelson you could see them eyeing each other and flirting all throughout the film... (-sigh- the nerds never get the girl...;)Anyhow, that aside, many of the lines are still memorable (혩Does Barry Manilow know you have his wardrobe?', 혩How DOES one become a janitor?', 혩No sir, because it's in Johnson's underwear...') And a lot of the quotes here have been used or referred to in many recent films (eg: Go). This film has a cool-factor of ten! It's hilarious, the interplay between characters is great, and even the cheezy parts are fun! The simple fact is that any aspect of this film that is groanable is smothered by all of the better aspects. And c'mon, being a high school teen is filled with cheeze anyhow, so it all fits in the greater scheme of things;)Overall: great direction, sharp dialogue, great acting (this was Judd Nelson's *best* role ever! And he carries this film as well...the other characters support him). Okay, so Emilio got the girl, so Judd Nelson pumped his fist in the air like a moron (hey, if *I* got to kiss Molly Ringwald, I'd be pumping my fist like a moron, too!!) This film is pure amusement, and behind it all we can nod our heads and say: yeah, this is what it was like! The pressures of being a teenager...life really could suck sometimes. And even though in retrospect it seem so silly, sometimes it's okay for the boring and trivial to be of earth-shattering importance...Take this film for what it is: a fun watch and a handbook to being a teenager, stereotypical or not. An easy 8/10!!",8,0,1,29 April 2001
Gladiator," Sorry Russell, Mel beat ya to it!
","Welcome to Braveheart, the Prequel! The similarities to Braveheart are*uncanny*! In fact, the only real differences between this and Braveheart (aside from the time period) are that Braveheart has a better script, more clever dialogue, better acting, far less horribly cheezy melodrama, and *much* less spit and polish. In fact, Gladiator is *so* polished that most of it looks *beyond* fake! The tigers were so obviously CGI'd that you could see the superimposition most of the time. And the squibs were obvious as well.And the melodrama!! Don't get me started on the melodrama!!! Braveheart should've cut the last 10 minutes you say? Gladiator should have cut the last half hour! Horribly cheezy death scenes followed by some of the worst schlock I've *ever* seen. His buddy burying his little figures as he meets his dead wife and child in the recurring wheat field dream-zone. I feel *something* rising inside of me, but believe me it's not tears...Phoenix was awful and unconvincing (he should watch a few of his late brother's films to learn a couple of things about acting...) and Russell Crowe is so far behind his role in LA Confidential that he's barely worth mentioning...which is frightening, because save for the always fabulous Oliver Reed's too small role, Crowe was actually a standout.Ridley, Ridley, Ridley, what are we to do with you?? First White Squall, now this??? Come one now! And get over the lightning already!! And the pacing!!! OUCH!! It's slow, it's fast, it's slow, it's fast, it's an action film, it's a melodrama, it's an action film...Make up your bleeding mind!! Pacing was horrid! And most of those slow-paced scenes dragged on *way* too long...Admittedly, *some* of the cinematography and sets were amazing (as is usual for Ridley Scott) but most was much less than I'd expect from one of the greatest scenic directors in modern cinematic history. Even aside from all of the hype, this film needed to chop off at least 30-40 minutes, ease up on the too-special special effects and get itself a decent cast. Oscar my butt! My advice? Save yourself two and a half hours and go see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon instead...or Braveheart...each has everything this doesn't. 6/10.",6,0,0,6 April 2001
High Fidelity," A rare gem! A perfect ten!
","I don't often think of a film as complete, or even near-perfect, but this one is damn close! Very respectful of the book (and I never thought a transplant from the UK to Chicago would work!), this film relates the story from print to tape in a way that's exceedingly rare these days. It took what it needed and knew when to let go of unnecessary scenes, which is all too often a missing factor in book to film translations.John Cusack is, IMHO, the most under-rated actor in Hollywood. I've loved his work since 16 Candles, and I can't think of a film offhand that he's in that I don't like. From the best teen film ever made (Say Anything) to outstanding dramas like the Grifters and Being John Malkovich and comedies like Grosse Pointe Blank, there's something about Cusack that just lights up a screen. He doesn't over act, he doesn't steal scenes from other actors...he's *always* on! And this film is no exception; it's hard to believe that this film wasn't written specifically for him (and being an absolute music geek and self-professed obsessed vinyl addict in real life, he wasn't stretching too far, either;)And the supporting cast is nothing short of brilliant! Todd Louiso and Jack Black are magnificent as the loner vinyl-shop geekboys, and they play beautifully off of each other and Cusack as well (the Cusack & co. vs. Tim Robbins scenes were *hilarious*!!) And John's sis Joan played perfectly off of him as well. In fact the chemistry between all supporting characters was quite good; Bonet, Zeta-Jones, Gregson Wagner and Lili Taylor all worked really well with Cusack, and Tim Robbins was  *very* amusing. I do wish that the adorable Sara Gilbert had a bigger role though;)Iben Hjejle was the only rotten apple here. The woman simply cannot act. She displays barely an ounce of emotion (not to mention a completely monotonous voice) and her expressiveness is less than impressive (non-existent?). If her role was at all important as anything other than a catalyst for the story, she might well ruin the film. But the scenes with her are all inevitably saved by Cusack, and don't last long enough to spoil the film.Overall: The soundtrack rocks (*love* that Beta Band song!;). The film is a perfect length. It reflects the book beautifully. It's a boon to vinyl freaks (like me;). The acting is incredible, and Cusack is at his absolute best here! And for God's sake it's got Bruce Springsteen in it!! WHAT MORE COULD ONE POSSIBLE ASK FOR??? A rare 10/10!",10,0,1,14 May 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Another winner from the Coens!
","I try not to go into a film with high expectations (how easy it is to be disappointed), but for this one I couldn't help myself. I've never seen a film by the Coen brothers I didn't like; a few of their films rank among my all-time favs. So my expectations were sky-high and even so I came out thrilled, surprised, and more than satisfied. This story is a wonderful homage to the Homeric epic, but crafted so nicely that even one who has no knowledge of the Odyssey will still love the film! (One or two scenes might be slightly confusing...the Baptism scene and the Sirens for example, but not enough to ruin the film for anyone). The cinematography was *wow* good! Gorgeous scenes, gorgeous sets, just plain gorgeous. And the film was marvelously acted, Clooney was a stand-out, his best performance ever (even topping the Peacemaker, and he was brilliant in that!). And Coen regulars John Turturro and John Goodman were fabulous as always! Allusions were everywhere, not just to Homer, but to Robert Johnson and Babyface (the bank robber, not the producer;), among others. The script was masterful, a perfect combination of epic flavour and modern story. This film is a keeper! Hilarious, well-written, well-crafted, beautifully shot...it proves that you don't need a 100 million dollar budget for special effects to make a quality film. This is right alongside Traffic and Crouching Tiger as the best films of the year! The only reason I don't give it a perfect ten is that it runs just a little long. An easy 9/10.",9,0,0,25 February 2001
