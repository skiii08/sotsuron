The Blair Witch Project," The ending still gives me chills.
","When a movie goes mainstream, it usually gets criticized heavily; you just can't please everyone. If the haters could just get pass all the hype and whatnot - while having a sense of imagination - this movie is not bad as what they make it out to be. It IS scary. The documentary style was really clever, and it was definitely a key advantage in making this movie scarier than other horror movies. I thought the acting was pretty natural and made it believable.This movie isn't one of those horror movies where it flashes a bunch of graphic images or sound effects at you, but it does it calmly and effectively. The ending REALLY left me with chills. People without a wide imagination will probably not find this movie scary; that's too bad. Really, to also get the full effect, it's best to watch it in the dark with no distraction. They did such a good job that some people might confuse this movie to be real.I would skip Blair Witch 2, though; it was not clever or entertaining as the original. This movie will definitely put fear in people camping at night, or even worse - someone standing in the corner with their back turned (in a dark room); it was that effective.",8,0,1,25 March 2006
Scarface," Definitely a classic. They can't make it like this anymore
","Took me all these years to finally see this classic film, even though everyone, even those who have never seen it, should know the famous 'Say hello to my little friend' line. The film is almost 3 hours, which seems like it would be a drag and way too long to sit through, but it actually went by faster than many dumb films these days with no substance.Of course, Al Pacino's performance is perfect and amazing as Tony Montana. You can't help but like the guy... he's not just some straight out one-dimensional vicious killer, but he is a guy who isn't afraid to be truthful and not be a 'cockroach'. He has some limits to his morality of not killing kids; wants to value his family, but at the same time wrecks it with no self-control. He's overly protective of his little sister that he would kill anyone for her. The biggest threat to him was himself. What's very interesting is how the film is able to capture the crippling decline of what happens when money and power/control gets to you. It's not just some shallow dumb movie shooting random bad guys that many action films is only able to do and there's no character.Tony Montana, 'Scarface', is a household name now because it's all about the depth of the character. Even the side character's like Michelle Pfeiffer, Gina, Manny, they all have character in them. I read some negative reviews from some people saying how the film is just about violence and degrade women, etc. and that it has no story... boy, are they wrong and only seeing it on the surface. Got to love the typical 80's overused montages. Haha They can't make films this raw and violent... the 80's really knew how to do it, like Robocop. Near the ending, pre-Terminator (T-600?) makes a cameo. Haha",9,2,4,10 July 2016
Mission: Impossible III," A third sequel better than the rest?! The BEST Mission Impossible yet!
","When it comes to movies hitting into their third sequel, it's usually the worst/inferior/disappointing or just simply utter junk for production companies to milk more money out of the name (Robocop 3, Jurassic Park 3, Terminator 3). But MI3 is surprisingly an exception! I have to say it's easily the most entertaining/thrilling out of the three and quite possibly the best one. I would say MI3 is definitely up there in the top action films.I honestly don't care for mindless action movies just bloated with action scenes one after the other--really takes a lot for me to be impressed by them--but I really enjoyed the action in MI3. It was really well-thought out. By the way, I'm not the type who only appreciates 'Michael Bay' flicks/action/teen/mainstream movies all the time. I do watch black & white films. Without giving too much away, the bridge scene was just the most intense. It was VERY exciting/entertaining to watch that scene. I was really impressed and engaged. What worked was it almost seemed like Ethan Hunt was really hopeless and didn't have a chance in this movie. It really was like his toughest mission yet.But what also worked was the story. It was actually quite clever and interesting for an action movie. Despite the villain's image, he definitely came off the most threatening and powerful.I also liked how it didn't go the typical cliché route in certain scenes (ticking countdown), with some unexpected results. This movie's got it all... the humor (about the 'little sister' joke and the 'We Are Family' music... that was great), action, story, beautiful international location shots... Maggie Q's sexy long legs in a dress and coming out of a Lamborghini Gallardo... you can't go wrong with that.I also watched 'Taken' (2008) before watching this movie and MI3 was miles more entertaining. No comparison. I honestly think 'Taken' is overrated. The premise were actually similar for both; a 'retired expert' gets back on his job to go after a kidnapped loved one. The action scenes in 'Taken' honestly did not excite me as it did with MI3. And there was no thrilling moments because the lead character for 'Taken' would just always kick butt; but like I said, Tom Cruise really had a challenge up against the bad guys in this one.Every MI movie has had a different director, and I'm not surprised the next MI4 will be directed by the same one as this one. I'd say it was definitely a success. Don't listen to the haters. This one is definitely worth checking out. I highly recommend this if you want to enjoy a very entertaining action movie with great action sequences--with a pretty clever story. If you have a nice surround sound and HDTV, this movie is definitely a must have too.",8,1,3,6 September 2009
United 93," Propaganda Film
","I watched this movie years ago before I started to listen to conspiracy theorists and then did my own research.If you take facts from a Hollywood movie and an administration that have been caught lying about WMD, scapegoat Bin Laden, the anthrax scare, illegal torturing, etc. -- then you're living in a fantasy world.Notice how Bush, Cheney, and many of his supporting puppets, like Giuliani, can't keep up with their lies. Their lies are clearly on tape numerous times when they are interviewed. They will simply deny the truth just like people who don't question anything about 9/11.The fact is, it's not only 'conspiracy theorists' wanting the truth just because (according to anti-truthers) 'they just crave attention'. Many family victims and soldiers fighting in Iraq question 9/11. People that easily accept the government's story cover up are the ones who are going against all the people that died in vain.What are we fighting for? For our safety? How odd that our country, considered to have the best defense in the world, and a building called the Pentagon, undeniably having one of the top securities/defense itself -- even when the whole nation is on alert and having very similar drills exactly an year before -- is still attacked by a group of 'terrorists' said to be terrible pilots (could not even fly a single-engine plane, yet somehow pulled off impossible maneuvers at low altitudes with a 757, after supposedly knocking over poles); a 'mastermind in a cave', are able to pull this off -- all on the same day. Yet, some people laugh more at the idea that it was a work of a CIA? Hmm. Many people know the name 'Bin Laden' after 2001. It's become a household name. But you'd be surprised how many people, many of whom that just don't question, still don't even know that a third tower, World Trade Center 7, even collapsed; since it was not hit by a plane -- like controlled demolition. And if they don't know that much, they probably don't even know it was the headquarters of the CIA (among others, FBI, DoD...) When you really look at 9/11, there are smoking guns at every corner. Laws of physics being defied. No dead bodies at the scene. There are many questions unanswered, key witnesses mysteriously dying, evidences being hidden -- like many surveillance videos being confiscated showing no Boeing 757 -- yet it's more tragic that there are still people out there that don't question at all, and rather support towards shutting out the truth by supporting the government's story; or just simply lost interest all together because of other media distractions, such as more important things like, 'Would Paris Hilton be okay in Jail?'.The fact of the matter is, saying it's a 'conspiracy' is considered taboo, so people just shut them out right away. Some people just can't handle the truth. They rather live a lie and ponder over more: 'Who would win the next American Idol?' I thought wow, United 93 is a powerful movie, especially the last few minutes. No question. It's a well-made fictional movie. But what this is, in end, is nothing but propaganda.We mostly watch movies for entertainment -- to make us feel happy, laugh, and be sad, etc. -- and if you want entertainment to simply make you feel sad or angry, then this movie can be it. However, just keep in mind this is not a documentary, and if you feel anger after the movie, in reality, the people that we should be 'mad as hell' at are not the 'terrorists' depicted in this movie. We have traitors in our country committing mass murder and getting away with it.Todd Beamer's 'Let's Roll.' (by the way, there is no recording of that account) -- it was the perfect heroic image the government needed, just like the Jessica Lynch rescue (it is a fact that the government/media manipulated that story). The 'Bin Laden' image for the 'terrorists' was also the perfect scapegoat. It is also sick that Todd's wife, Lisa Beamer, is capitalizing on her husband's death and catch phrase.History repeats itself. Nazi's Enabling Act 1933 and Patriot Act 2001. Reichstag fire and 9/11. Scary, isn't? Take truth as the authority, instead of authority as the truth.",1,30,70,8 May 2009
Minority Report," A Powerful yet Entertaining Film. A Masterpiece. A spectacular look of the future!
","Forget those BORING Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies... MINORITY REPORT is what you need to see for excitement and a good story to keep you focused in. This movie will all you'll be thinking about after watching it.Easily one of the best movies ever! The story was brilliant and very original, something we've never even imagined of seeing. The movie is never predictable, many scenes shocked me with amazement giving me chills throughout the movie. Very exciting and highly interesting story with spectacular gorgeous special effects. I enjoyed even just watching the futuristic surroundings. And I thought the future world in 'Back to the Future: Part II' was amazing and then when I saw A.I, but WOW, wait till you see Minority Report!The action scenes were thrilling and very intense (I enjoyed every second of it) as well as the story! There were many dramatic moments which I liked but still had good humor in it.Speilberg likes to extend his movies a lot until he can conclude it entirely without leaving you hanging. You think it's about to end but it keeps going and I think people didn't like A.I as much because it overextended (fairy scene). But in Minority Report the ending was good, not too disappointing after all the anticipation for this movie, I thought he ended it well. A solid movie from beginning to end.I wouldn't recommend taking your kids to see this movie at the theaters, the action might seem great to them but I think the story would be confusing for them and Minority Report had some sexual scenes and some language (I remember Tom saying the 'F' word). In the other hand A.I was more 'Disney' like so I think little kids would like that better but thank god Speilberg made the elements for Minority Report for older audiences.I thought A.I was kind of mainly for kids and Minority Report is great for adults. Don't worry if you were disappointed with A.I (I thought A.I was good but the ending was too Disney like), you'll definitely enjoy Minority Report all the way through or at least I did.Don't think the movie will be really really really really good cause sometimes when you have high expectations for it, it usually ends up less good and you'll end up being disappointed. But I don't know, I knew this movie would be good and it ended up being good so I guess there's an exception for this movie. (Just saying because I expected too much for Spider-Man with everyone saying it's really good and seeing the rating on IMDB also. Then after seeing it I was wondering what was so good about it?)The movie is 2 and half hours long, there are a few slow downs so you have to be patient sometimes! But there are many exciting moments between them.
Minority Report is definitely this summer's blockbuster, could be Oscar material. Even those two critics that complain a lot gave it Two Thumbs WAY UP and called it a masterpiece. This movie is already top 100 on IMDB.What more can I say... Go see this movie! Definitely worth the money.Words can't describe this movie, you have to see it for yourself!I can't wait to buy this on DVD. I think Speilberg and Cruise should work together more and Speilberg should make more futuristic movies!Tom Cruise and Steven Speilberg both proves again they are one of the best actor/director with this movie.Overall Rating: 9/10",9,0,0,26 June 2002
A Star Is Born," Definitely overrated. Not really a story - A Concert Movie.
","People overhyped this movie too much. This movie is definitely overrated. Bohemian Rhapsody has a lot of praise too but that one actually lived up to the hype. If you have better things to do, avoid this as it will be a waste of your time and you'll constantly be looking at your watch/time.The movie is honestly really boring/slow/predictable. It's more of a promotional concert/music video than a storytelling movie; surprisingly, on the other hand, Bohemian Rhapsody doesn't drag it to make it a musical/concert but more of a storytelling - that's what makes that film more entertaining.The romance between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga is extremely forced from the beginning and not heartfelt/romantic at all - I'm sorry but this is no Jack/Rose chemistry.If you actually bought the romance between the two stars, you probably believe in the 'romance' between Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence in Passengers. They're both very superficial.While I did like the music and there is a sad moment, it doesn't merit the praise it is getting because overall the movie really is dragged out about really nothing.There is some theme about alcoholism and mental stability, but I believe that part is a major afterthought/falls in the background and the movie is spent too much time on the concert/music performances. Overall it's more of a superficial film.If you had a choice between this movie and Bohemian Rhapsody, definitely see Bohemian - that one is a must-see performance/story wise. I think people are overpraising Gaga's performance too; I mean, we've seen it from Cher and even Mariah wasn't THAT bad in Glitter.",3,6,12,24 February 2019
Passengers," Predictable. Unoriginal. Uninspiring. Cheesy. Bad Casting. One time watch.
","I gave this movie a try because while the critics gave it a harsh score, there seems to be quite a bit of positive user reviews - it currently has a 7/10 - well, the critics were right this time. I can't understand the positive reviews by the regular users... The movie is so predictable, cheesy, and dull. No real smart thrills or twists. Just plain point A to point B. It must be the kids of this generation that haven't seen many films enjoy this movie, while critics and avid movie watchers have seen this movie before. It's many ideas stolen from Wall-E (2008), Gravity (2013), Interstellar (2014), The Martian (2015)... but done on the IQ level of the movie Transformers; it seems like a grade school student wrote this film. The story is generic and uninspiring. The pacing is awful. It's just so cheesy and predictable ('Oh Mr Robot, please keep this a secret.... I'm positive you won't tell anyone but I feel like telling you anyway just to get some twists going') - there is no shock value or real thrill to the film. The plot seems more like a short story TV episode where they dragged it out with pointless scenes like virtual dancing, basketball, and swimming. The movie probably would have worked as a 30 minute short film story, but it's dragged out to 2 hours of unexciting bad pacing fill-ins. I saw this film in 3D (being a big 3D fan), and you'd think even the most mundane scenes would still be more enjoyable because of the 3D advantage, but it wasn't. I know the movie 'Gravity' actually has a pretty dull 'story' as well, but at least the 3D for that film was spectacular and thrilling. The script was bad enough, but the casting is probably worse; Chris Patt and Jennifer Lawrence is like the most superficial horribly balanced combination ever. You just can't sympathize with them. There's also nothing romantic about with the chemistry/setup with the characters, especially from the script - both have done creepy actions. While Chris's action may be unforgivable, how could one fall in love with someone who goes complete psycho ape sh*t kicking your face and everything? It would have been more interesting to have Chris react differently towards the Bartender after the 'incident', but a wasted opportunity yet again because the movie always likes to play it safe. This is one of those rental movies where watching it once is enough and is pretty forgettable.",5,1,2,15 June 2017
Spotlight," BOOORING AS A FILM.... Robbed an Oscar just for the subject matter.
","So I watched this on the plane, had plenty of time to kill, because it won an Oscar, yet it was as exciting as watching paint dry...We get it that the subject matter is controversial and it's an 'important event' in reality. THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT MAKES IT A PLEASURABLE ENTERTAINING FILM (and no, I don't need Michael Bay or ridiculous 'Taken' action sequences; I'm looking for a story that has great build-up, brings in different emotions, blows my mind or puts me on the edge, etc). You say 'WHAT?! You don't find people in the church raping young children finally being exposed by a local newspaper move you in anyway?!' The real-life story/subject matter, yes... but NOT this film. If your 'enjoyment' is just observing a depiction of what we already knew and was established, then this is for you.There really are no satisfying or shocking moments/ending. What you see is what you already know... you don't really get anything out of it. The journey does not flow well. How can anyone find this movie 'shocking' when we already knew about the premise and it really adds nothing new to it? I mean, for a movie like TITANIC, we KNOW the ship is going to sink, but the EXPERIENCE of the film made it worthwhile. Spotlight fails on the EXPERIENCE. It is as boring as observing a meeting at an office. For this to win an Oscar just meant they like to give awards to the 'underdog' or just simply because of the controversy subject matter.This film is on the same level as when 'The Artist' won Oscar - another overrated boring film (probably forgotten by most people by now; as much as I can enjoy black and white films) - which just simply won more for the IDEA than the quality of the film. Skip it.",1,29,78,23 May 2016
Ready Player One," GUNDAM!!!!!! Fun times at the movies - Willy Wonka Meets Wreck-it-Ralph
","I saw an early screening of this last week. I've never heard of the book before, but I am a fan of movies, 80's, retro games and this being directed by Spielberg finally got me interested in a movie I would actually watch these days. The movie runs 2 hours and 20 minutes (almost 3 hours) but it doesn't feel long at all as it doesn't drag much (maybe around the 3rd part it slows down) This movie basically reminds me of Willy Wonka meets Wreck-it-Ralph. Instead of a candy factory, the competition deals with a virtual reality 'gaming' world where the first one to find all 3 secret 'easter egg' keys would become ownership of the world. It is actually perfect timing today and not too far fetched with all the VR technology and avatar/gaming society going on. I wouldn't say the movie is powerful or intense on the level of Spielberg's Minority Report, but the movie definitely does have its moments, especially the beginning racing scene. The movie is definitely a must-experience in theater, especially with the thunderous Dolby Atmos pounding the chairs when the T-Rex from Jurassic Park and King Kong is smashing everything. The most exciting, interesting, fun parts of the movie is when you see all these nostalgic iconic things appearing on the screen at the same time; I wish the whole film could just be that.The movie will be more enjoyable if you've seen or know anything about Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror film The Shining. The best parts for me was definitely the beginning racing scene (the Delorean, but I wish it would have actually flown too instead of just being grounded most of the time driving), with Jurassic Park and King Kong; The Shining; and last battle where Gundam shows up did give me slight chills. I saw Chun Li, street fighter characters but they were so brief, like it would have been cooler to see more of those iconic characters fighting. The final battle, there's too many characters on screen at once, it's too hard to spot what they are. Goro from Mortal Kombat is in it. There's a lot well known soundtrack in this movie, even the original Japanese Godzilla theme song was a nice touch. One thing I found odd was how it seemed like this IOI company was the mafia and running all these drones around the public and suddenly at the end the movie, we find actual police officers existed in the movie... like where the hell were they this whole damn time??? I wish we could see more of these nostalgic infused character types of movies. I wish they would have had Johnny Five from Short Circuit or Robocop.... come on that's 80's!! Maybe they couldn't get the rights I guess.While the movie is enjoyable, it is typical Spielberg campy family-Disney ending with a pretty goofy villain. There's a cute 'twist' but not really any major shock when it comes to the plot. Overall though, it's a movie worth checking it out in theaters, IMAX, 3D, Atmos, the best you possibly could.",7,0,1,29 March 2018
Lost in Translation," The biggest star in the movie: Japan
","This has to be one of the most overrated movies. Yes, it is shot beautifully, but it is because it takes place in none other than - Japan. If they were to take the same story and then film it in America, I guarantee you - it would not be praised this much. Don't get me wrong, I give credit to Bill Murray as well; if it wasn't for him, I'd probably fall asleep during the movie. He added the subtle comedic act - not too forced - which was good for me (I hate forced humor like in movies such as 'Along Came Polly' or 'Scary Movie 3') to make me laugh a bit. If this movie didn't have that, then it would've been really dull and boring, since the story wasn't doing it and neither was Scarlett Johansson's character (Charlotte). Even Sofia Coppola (the director) mentioned how she wouldn't have made the movie if Bill Murray were to decline the part - surprise surprise.People who love this movie say there's much more to the story, but there seriously isn't much going on! (Some audiences just like to create their own imagination/story than what the movie is actually showing) The story is just plain and simple. Basically, it's just two lonely Americans connecting together in Japan. Great. Who doesn't get lonely when they're far away from home or a loved one? I could only come up with these reasons why people love this movie:1.) The viewer has never traveled to Japan, so watching this movie was exciting to them. Or the viewer just has a love for Japan. 2.) The viewer has/had their own lonely mid-life crisis and can/could relate to the characters. (Even though the story is just so brief and simple... hmm, they must get easily touched.) 3.) The viewer likes the 'real-life' style of the movie with slow pacing, unlike the typical Hollywood look movies. Kind of like films such as Magnolia and Punch Drunk Love. (I do like this kind of style... but the story was just not there.)4.) Fan of any Bill Murray movie. (This one is lame--I know, but there are hardcore fans out there)If you have some time to waste, then you'll probably have the patience to watch this entire movie. But if you don't - don't watch it. It will feel like it just drags on and all you could do is sit there and wait for something to happen - nothing mind blowing will ever happen in the movie! (Unless you consider a Japanese strip club with business men as shocking). And as I mentioned before, if you don't have the money to travel to Japan; or have no clue what Japan looks like (and would like a general idea); or just have an interest in Japan; then you might enjoy this movie, since you might feel like you're traveling with the characters. But that's about it.Actually, take a trip to Japan and visit Shibuya, Tokyo (there is a short scene in the movie) and just stand there - you'll see more stuff happening there than in this entire movie.Oh, about the whole hotel shower scene in the beginning where Bill Murray is supposedly too tall for it... he could've just adjusted the thing even higher! He just stopped it half way! And one more thing... please - it's 'Moshi moshi', not 'Mushi mushi' like some idiot in the movie was saying.**** Some minor spoiler: To people who saw the movie *** Seriously, what is so beautiful about the STORY? Charlotte is a snob who attended Yale and thinks low of others. It seems to me that she was only interested in Bob Harris (Bill Murray's character) because he was a star. And yes, she knew fully well he was a star. I really doubt she would've approached him if he was some stranger. And as for Bill Murray's character, he did end up cheating on his wife by sleeping with an old lady! I mean, come on.... what was that all about?!The ending just had no meaning... I doubt their experience together changed them. It was basically a 'one night stand' kind of thing... yeah, isn't that beautiful? Others can disagree with me, but that is what the movie is SHOWING. So the only beautiful thing about this movie were images of Japan. That's it.",5,3,6,4 September 2005
American Sniper," BOOOORING!!!! Seriously? This has to be a joke... Was I watching a messy TV episode???
","I can't believe how this could get nominated for anything other than Bradley Cooper's skills of handling the plastic baby as if its moving. I'm glad the public makes fun of this movie for the baby because that alone represents this whole movie that it really can't be taken seriously. What the hell was Clint Eastwood thinking? Obviously he was more concerned about making money out of this film than a quality story/film and didn't even have the patience to use a real baby - everything is rushed. This movie is an absolute mess! You can see how rushed this movie was made and there was no real thought process into it.I seriously thought I was watching a crappy, cheap cheesy cliché TV episode... I am not a war movie nut, but at least BLACK HAWK DOWN has a cinematic feel and is way more thrilling and had a main focus and knew what they were trying to tell.. This film has no idea where it's trying to go, all over the place, boring shootout scenes that just drag. The whole premise of cowboy enlisting to the SEALS after seeing a terrorist attack on TV and 9/11; how they just end up in Iraq and going after 'Bin Laden's men' just has this whole propaganda Hollywood cliché one-dimensional idea. The movie only achieves glorifying a man being a 'legend sniper' killing throughout the movie; honestly, the movie even fails there to portray this guy as a legend. There is no moment in the movie where you are on the edge of your seat... everything is so cliché from the bad guy sniper to the flat soldiers and unfunny script writing. There is no coherent flow or story! There is NEVER any quality build up.The trailer was the ONLY 'exciting' thing about this film... I watched this film with anticipation it would have that buildup and tense moments that the trailer leads you to believe. THE MOVIE IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Cliché AND SO SO AWFUL. I kept looking at my watch and wondering if this film was going to get any better. Nope. The ending sums up the whole movie: rushed. This is one shallow Hollywood war movie that makes Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor seem Oscar worthy - I mean at least that one felt more cinematic and an enjoyable movie experience. Even for the actions alone, it's the most boring and cliché. There is a scene with the sandstorm where you can't even see what the hell is going on. SKIP IT.",1,3,19,16 January 2016
Lion," MUST SEE! POWERFUL! Bring on the Kleenex!! Extra boxes of them. The little boy is an instant star...
","I honestly, initially, didn't really have any interest in this film, even with all the Oscar nomination raves going towards it because I had no idea what it was about other than the title being 'Lion' and it starred the guy from 'Slumdog Millionaire' and had a very odd looking Nicole Kidman... When I finally heard what the film was really all about, it intrigued me and the film really had me hooked from the start of the film. The little boy in this film is easily an instant star! He is adorable like a little puppy. His older brother, Guddu, also has a strong memorable presence. I didn't really care about the relationship with the girlfriend, as that just felt rushed and irrelevant, but the relationships with the brothers and mothers is just so heart-wrenching.I thought once it got to the older version played by Dev Petel, I thought the film would end up being weaker, because the little boy is just so charming, but Dev did a great job. It didn't win any Oscars, but who cares. Anyone can relate to trying to find your home and that rush of emotions filling up. The music and cue really adds to the emotions. The power of technology and determination. I don't really like Google using this for their commercial, though.",9,0,0,26 February 2017
Forrest Gump," If there is such a thing as a 'Perfect Film', this is it.
","Just like Back to The Future, even decades later, the pacing is fantastic and it just lives up to the test of time. Honestly, if you haven't seen this film, you must be living in a cave or born yesterday. This is THE film that has everything. It appeals to everyone because...1) best soundtrack ever; so many classics it's crazy how much royalties they must have paid for it. 2) fantastic cast and acting. You just can't imagine anyone else playing the part of Forrest Gump other than Tom Hanks. 2) it has everything from romance, comedy, drama, history, special effects, action, best storytelling/script... I mean, what movie contains all that in one perfectly? It makes you laugh to the highest point and it makes you cry your eyes out. It's just an incredibly perfectly made film.",10,1,2,4 July 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Lived up to the hype! 'A star is born' is overrated, but this is a masterpiece
","Everyone was praising this movie and I finally watched it - it still lived up to the hype!I don't know what's the deal with all these musical movies this year, but this one should win Best Picture.I saw 'A Star is Born' right before this movie and I have to say THAT movie is definitely overrated. (Super boring with no real story/just a concert movie.)Then I saw Bohemian Rhapsody. It was entertaining from start to finish with great pacing. This actually has a deep great story and not just a long promotional music video.Rami Malek's performance was just absolutely mesmerizing. He stole the show. It reminded me on the same level of the movie Amadeus.The way they brought in the music was perfect. The whole 'wayne's world' reference was hilarious too. The casting is perfect. (Surprised little Timmy from Jurassic Park starred in this movie!)This is definitely a must-see movie, unless you don't like the music from Queen... then you have poor taste to begin with.Yes, it will definitely Rock You.",9,3,5,24 February 2019
Baby Driver," A movie for Teenagers. Fast and the Furious dumb entertainment
","Most of us enjoy the Fast and the Furious series knowing how stupid it is going to be; when you watch this expecting it to be on the same level, then it can be a dumb, fun movie rental to enjoy. From start to finish, it's a movie where you completely turn off your brain. However, when people start praising it to be anything more than that, you will be disappointed. It's super cliché with many stereotypical characters.While the plot has absolutely nothing to do with it, this movie reminds me of the 1998 Wes Anderson film 'Rushmore' (EXTREMELY horrible movie that's overpraised) for its own pretentiousness 'art' of itself; the movie is really dumb, but when directors put a collection of good soundtrack, making it more like a music video than a movie, then that gimmick starts to fool some audiences to enjoy the 'movie' when it's really the music doing most of the work. I mean, how can you go wrong with Barry White... he got that sexy deep voice... I love that song. The movie is definitely geared towards the teenager audience with its A.D.D editing, the most cheesiest dialogues (the relationship between Baby and the waitress, especially the dialogue they have together is extremely cringe vomit-worthy) and super cheesy flashback/backstory of Baby with his mother. Everything is in-your-face, so even the most dumbest low-attention span viewer can understand, (they show all these cassette tapes and there's one labeled 'Mom' clearly right in your face too; even the laundromat, they put matching colorful clothing spinning in the machines just because it looks cool, really throwing out any real sense of realism) The movie is extremely silly, not to mention so many outrageous moments (Don't even get me started on the double red cars with sunroof and super random cowboy 'agent' dude in a truck), where people conveniently appear and end up at the same time/place just for the sake of the movie, it seemed more like a major comedy. The movie is super straight forward that there really is no depth to the characters. Everything and everyone is just so plastic Hollywood production, like something you see out of a Michael Bay Transformers film. Without Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx, the movie would have been a lot worse. What's actually really funny or creepy or awkward, is after all the Kevin Spacey scandal, it just makes watching him talking to Baby, his lines in the movie, really ironic. For me, a more interesting, deep, intense robbery movie is something like 'The Place Beyond the Pines' (2012). Baby Driver is like a teenager wrote the script for the teenage audience with teenager editing.",5,2,5,10 November 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," NO WAY this is the best one. CRAZY reviews! Same old Same old... even more suspension of disbelief! SILLY! the first 1996 MI is still the best one.
","People writing that this MI is the best is out of their minds or they must be teens from this generation... They just can't make films like they used to... I guess studios pressure too much to rush things and cram as much ridiculous action and ideas as possible... can't they understand LESS is usually MORE?!? I understand Ethan Hunt is a super agent, but he's not superman! It all started with Ghost Protocol (directed by a guy who makes great animated films like Incredibles) turning the series very cartoony... and Rogue Nation continues that style.I mean, I can suspend disbelief, even as far as the agents to create realistic masks to disguise as others, but when are the lines drawn??? Too much and it gets TOO CARTOONY and the intensity actually backfires. When it takes you out of realism, one can't help but start to roll their eyes...The trailer really hypes up the airplane scene, but it's really what you see in the trailer, which is a shame. I believe the 'underwater scene', also in the trailer, is supposed to be the 'big mission' (like the first MI hanging in the office scene where they have to bypass several security.) I was really excited to see what they would come up with or how that part was going to be... However, that was also a letdown for me and it's a scene where you REALLY have to go beyond disbelief... I mean that facility itself is TOTALLY ridiculous; it's totally a movie setup scenario... I know it's called Mission Impossible... but let's not get carried away with Mission Outrageous! I mean, might as well have a mission where Ethan has to land on moon to retrieve something without a spacesuit or a rocket to fly on... Ethan can do it! Give me a break. He has no fear!Funny how the underwater scene seems like they did that to take advantage of some 3D effects, but Rogue Nation actually isn't shown in 3D. More long redundant car super close-up shots of bike chases we've seen before... it's getting old...There's one scene where the car flips over and the CG is so horribly done... couldn't they have flipped a real car?? It was really bad. If I had to rank the MI franchise, it would be: 1. Mission Impossible (1996) - having the most 'realistic/serious/raw' feeling and instant classic mission scene (falling down rope/office sweatdrop and ending tunnel scene were exciting)2. Mission Impossible III (2006) - Had the best villain and bridge scene was also exciting/memorable. For me, this had the best combination of humor without being overly ridiculous and action. Ethan really seemed the most vulnerable in this one, which made it more exciting. This one is VERY underrated because it was a time when Cruise was getting a lot of bad rep jumping on Oprah's couch/scientology 3. Mission Impossible II (2000) - Many disliked the story, but John Woo gave MI a whole new style. Many see these series for the action and the car dancing/bike chases were well done. 4 TIE. MI 4: Ghost Protocol (2011) & MI 5: Rogue Nation (2015) If you actually enjoyed Ghost Protocol, then I'm sure you'll like this one too. The style is similar. Personally, I didn't care for Ghost Protocol, so if you're like me and didn't enjoy that one, Rogue Nation is no different. It's really what you expect... nothing more, nothing less... really nothing special that revolutionizes the series or action films. Don't believe people who actually say this is the best one... ridiculous!For me, the first 1996 MI is still the best one overall.Although there is no slowing down in the movie, there just wasn't that build-up anticipation or really new excitement that's there in the original Mission Impossible film... If you can accept silly action and enjoy the redundant car chases we've seen a million times already, the ticking time bomb that's also been overused a zillion times, bad guys that can never aim, then this film is for you. Sorry, but I'm not easily impressed. Forgettable mission. The 1996 Mission Impossible hanging scene will always be a classic.",5,3,7,5 August 2015
Resident Evil," Make sure you have a good healthy heart before seeing this movie!
","One of the reason that gave interest for seeing this movie was I myself for playing all the Resident Evil series. And the other was they did a really good job with the trailer which made me want to see it even more. It seemed really cool which it was.I really expected the story to be simple where you too can be brainless like the zombies and still understand what's going on but the storyline is actually thought really well, many scenes shocked me many times, good thing about this movie is you can't really predict what's going to happen next and there are many chilling all of a sudden something popping out every few minutes which keeps you awake and interested at all times.Out of all the game-to-movie adaption, Resident Evil is the best entertaining film, Final Fantasy wasn't too bad but it lacked in similarity with the game and some scenes made me fall asleep and Tomb Raider was just a joke. Resident Evil though, you can watch many times and not get bored. Pure entertainment.I don't think this is much of a spoiler but the ending is similar to the start of Resident Evil 2 the game. Another plus is it uses many ideas from all the Resident Evil series such as the mutated dogs in RE1, the licking creature in RE2. I'm sure it's hard to use ideas from games to a movie which the creators of Final Fantasy didn't do a good job of (where were the chocobo's?!) anyways, even if you haven't played the game at all you MUST see this movie!I think this was a great start to build up to the sequal, if they make a sequal which they must, a lot of people will be craving to see the movie. For you gamers who saw this movie I'm sure the sequal will have Nemesis like in RE3.#1 Game to the big screen movie! Actually the RE1 the game was practically a movie with real people in the game. The game is no doubt one of the best games ever made and this movie is pretty much up there with the horror movies.I would give this film a 7 but Milla Jovovich looked great in this movie! +1Overall Rating: 8/10 Great Entertainment! I never heard so many screams in the theater before, hopefully even more scares and gore in the sequal, hehe.",8,0,0,17 March 2002
Man on the Moon," I don't have time for this...
","Obviously they put that weird act with the ending credits shown in the beginning and Jim Carey shows up and talks a bunch of crap and then goes away for awhile and comes back telling us this movie is definitely NOT for everyone... you have to be soo patient especially since it's about some guy's life where i have never even heard of this comedian, I just watched the film ONLY because i heard Jim Carey was in it but this movie was soo stupid and ESPECIALLY ANNOYING! His jokes were soo stupid not even worth hearing. This movie just made me pissed and if they didn't tell us Jim Carey was in this movie then most people would probably not go see this like me, let's face it who actually knew about this comedian and wanted to know more about his life? raise your hands people! Uh, let's see maybe 5 people out of 1,000,000...?! Seriously i think Jim Carey is a great actor but he was soo annoying and stupid in this movie and i know Jim Carey likes to act that way like in (Dumb & Dumber) and stuff but those are 'stupid funny' but in this movie he was just plain stupid and annoying. One of the WORST movies ever!Overall: 1.5/10",1,7,17,10 August 2001
Gone Girl," WOW!!! You want to be shocked/jaw drop, watch this!
","MUST SEE movie if you love films with substance and enjoy thrillers/character pieces - no A.D.D mindless action (they showed Taken 3 during the previews, seriously!??!?) This is a VERY *CRAZY* and gripping movie. It's just INSANE. There was one scene where the whole theater just went completely silent... not one drop of sound... I think everyone just had their jaw open in disbelief, including myself. It really blew me away and most films these days don't do that for me. I was very engaged throughout the film... you don't really know who to feel sorry for.If you enjoyed PRISONERS, with Hugh Jackman, you will enjoy this too (yes, both films are almost 3 hours long, so if you can't sit still, it's not for you); they're both equally gripping, but it is more shocking.I felt some 50 Shades of Grey... There is nudity and sex in the film, so if you can't handle that, it's not for you. I have not read the book or knew anything about the film, so everything was fresh to me... Amazing performances and excellent casting. Rosamund Pike as AMY is perfect. Ben Affleck is good. Neil Patrick Harris... Wow, that was some interesting character... People like these DO exist, and that is what makes it frightening... Not zombies or ghosts. This movie blew me away. The story, performances, editing.... This film proves amazing films can still be made today!!This film is scary in a whole new level. It's definitely a movie that will leave an imprint on your brain and want to keep discussing about the film. Highly recommended. It is a DARK film - it is a HEAVY thrill-ride experience. MUST SEE. GO SEE IT!",9,2,13,3 October 2014
Lincoln," One word to describe this film: BORING. The film should have been called '13th Amendment' instead of 'Lincoln'.
","Totally overrated.So you have the name Spielberg attached to it, a beautiful production and cast and Oscar-winner Daniel Day-Lewis... HOWEVER, underneath all that, this is one BORING film.What do we go to to the movies for? Mostly entertainment. Spielberg and this film seems to totally forget that element.It's obvious the screenwriter is more of a playwright than knowing the smooth flow, dramatic transitioning, and pacing translating it on film.The film is just talking heads the entire film and seems better suited for a stage performance or TV series.In the making, they mentioned the first draft of the screenplay was over 500 pages (generally, one page is worth 1 minute of screen time); so, originally, it would have been over an 8 hour film.Spielberg had to cut it down a lot, and he decided the most important part of the book adaptation was the '13th Amendment' section.The title of the film 'Lincoln' is very misleading. It really should have just been called '13th Amendment' but of course that would be a horrible marketing title.I mean, there's a few scenes where they tried to show the personal side of Lincoln and his family, like the relationship with Lincoln and his son (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) but it really doesn't go anywhere and feels totally incomplete.If one really had no idea or ever heard of who Lincoln was, they really wouldn't get much out of this film either.The whole film just focuses on trying to pass the '13th Amendment' with Lincoln hiring men to convince Democrats to switch their votes. It's extremely boring and frustrating to watch and listen. You might as well watch C-Span.The pacing of the film is really horrible and it drags the entire time from start to finish - there really is no high point -- yet the ending feels completely rushed.This is by far the most boring film Spielberg has ever produced. Don't be fooled by high production visuals/set and performance.This may be enjoyed by history critics (whether they agree with its accuracy or not), but for people who are looking for a full pleasurable movie-going experience, this film is not it, especially if you don't care for politics.I also feel Denzel Washington was robbed for Best Actor in 'Flight' for the Oscars; his performance was much more powerful throughout the entire film than Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln. Even a 6 year old can play as Lincoln on a school play...",3,1,4,24 April 2013
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Disappointing... A documentary on this history would've been more interesting to watch.
","First of all, I actually wanted to watch this movie because I was first introduced about Edward Murrow in my film class -- thought THAT was interesting -- and especially since this movie was nominated for many awards. Maybe because it had too much hype to begin with, or it's the fact that this movie just isn't interesting to be a movie, but I just didn't like it at all.This movie isn't historically accurate, other than the major points of Murrow against the senator -- because the screenwriters had to come up with the conversations themselves.I think the transition between using actual TV footage at the time and the actual movie was slightly distracting; it's like did we go from a film to watching a documentary? I'm sure this was historically an important event, at least for TV journalists, but it was just really boring as a movie. If you were alive during that time, you probably already had the back-story and found the movie engaging, but for others, the movie expects one to dive into it knowing all the horror that was going on at the time; this makes it extremely hard for modern viewers to relate and follow.I just never felt that intensity (other than the look of it, by cheating aesthetics using extreme close-ups) ever for the story. I didn't see McCarthy as this threatening guy as he might have been. I didn't see Murrow as this 'most trusted guy on TV'; his character was really boring as he's the same from start to finish (just giving speeches all the time or smoking). Robert Downey Jr. and his wife in the movie, basically a 'B' story that they forcefully threw in, wasn't anything special. I just didn't feel anything for any of the characters. The movie felt rushed and undeveloped (it's like let's see the showdown with Murrow and McCarthy already), even though it was also tedious, waiting for something to happen. It's just one of those stories that doesn't translate well on film. A documentary on this would be far superior and interesting.I recommend NETWORK (1976) way over this - it's a lot more engaging and mind opening showing the corruption of television/corporation. I guess you could see Howard Beale (fictional character), the guy in NETWORK, kind of like Edward Murrow.",4,1,2,31 March 2008
World Trade Center," HORRENDOUS acting. EVERYTHING is over-the-top CHEESINESS. Jesus? ANNOYING film. GARBAGE. Please burn this film.
","I'm going to say it straight.The acting by EVERYONE in this film is soooo HORRENDOUS it's unbelievable.You can tell all the actors really have absolutely NO empathy at all, thus the result of their performance.EVERYONE in this film is PLASTIC and FLAT. It's really disgusting to watch.They ALL sound like they're literally reading off a script right in front of them, as if they're looking at a sign that says ACT SAD - ACT MAD.If you actually feel emotion from these plastic performances, I'm sorry but you're just as pathetic.It's like a film made by student actors. Seriously. Did they just all have only one acting rehearsal and just use the first take? I don't blame solely on all the actors. The director is mainly responsible. It's BAD directing. It's like the director just asked them to act 'SAD' or scream. It's a total flat play on human emotions.It is like watching a soap drama; if you're into that then maybe you can tolerate this movie. They show Jesus in the film. Are you serious? They try to make everything so over-the-top, but it's just NONSENSE. TRASH.This is an absolute disgrace and disrespect to the innocent people that died on that day. This film comes off more of a mockery. Even if you were to take away the atrocious acting, the chalkboard-screech-screaming annoyance, it's a disgrace they make a story about *WORLD* Trade Center just about two police officers being trapped. It's like nobody else mattered. And please, I respect all the innocent people who tragically died on that day and I will NEVER forget that day. I don't understand why some people think questioning 9/11 and asking for the actual truth (there are still more questions than answers) shows disrespect, when in fact, people who just eat up lies instead are allowing them to die in vain.That being said, films like this spreading TOTAL PROPAGANDA is a greater disrespect to EVERYONE. I understand some people rather live a lie and can't handle the truth -- don't want to hear anything about 9/11 and the word 'conspiracy' going together.HOWEVER, films like this and United 93 is pure PROPAGANDA (maybe it's not so obvious to some of you like it's watching 'Triumph of the Will' but it's happening in current times). Clearly, the cheesy dialogues and scenarios are FABRICATED for more drama/impact and BRAINWASHING the public. The film United 93 is a propaganda done more in a believable way (the ending of that film is definitely intense), but it is still what it is: Propaganda. It's not the first time the US tried to create a fake heroic image (look up Jessica Lynch) and release a movie about it.You don't take FACTS from Hollywood films. It's the LAST place you learn anything. It's just purely entertainment 99% of the time.Are you going to watch Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor and actually believe THAT is what Pearl Harbor was really about? NO. But there's a lot of lazy Americans who don't take the time to really QUESTION, and just eat up information just because it's coming from our own government/TV. That is why those people are referred to as a Sheep. Of course we all take news from the TV when it first happens, I'm not saying that makes one a sheep, but even after all the years and new questions/answers have come out, and people STILL decide to ignore it, then yes, that does make them one.Ask yourself these questions: There's many surveillance cameras around the Pentagon area. They were all confiscated. Why? They cannot prove it. You'll be surprised how many people are ignorant about a third World Trade Center collapsing that day. Why? Because the media didn't want to focus too much on that. It's a major red flag. Buildings do not collapse like that. That is a FACT. ALL evidences show, United 93 and Flight 77, had hardly any pieces on the ground. Plane crashes do not disintegrate and just leave a small hole. EVERYTHING that happened that day was an unusual phenomenon. Give me a break. When was the last time a commercial plane was actually hijacked? FOUR planes successfully hijacked and allowed to be in the cockpit? Not to mention pulling off unthinkable maneuvers at low altitudes that even the most trained pilot would not be able to replicate (I'm talking about Flight 77). What do you all people think about the Bush Administration? They were very trusting weren't they? It's just a sheer coincidence that the Bush Administration's think tank, PNAC, was hoping for a 'A NEW PEARL HARBOR' an year before? It should be obvious when you add everything together and it doesn't make sense that we had a war in Iraq. Look who really benefited through all this. Watch the film 'Wag the Dog' instead of this garbage if you still can't understand. It isn't a first time a President lied to America. Did we all forget how strongly Clinton tried to lie to America about his affair? Nixon? Ignorance is bliss.Isn't it convenient how they allegedly kill off Bin Laden and he doesn't stand a trial or anything. The perfect scapegoat, the Boogeyman, came and went that helped both administrations (previous and current) in office. His body is also washed to the sea. Give me a break. So let's brainwash the public into believing this lie even more by having another movie an year later. We'll soon be getting another wide-release propaganda film called 'Zero Dark Thirty' about Bin Laden. It's obvious from the trailers, it's just another popcorn drama propaganda flick. I wouldn't be surprised that film will brainwash more people about 'finding Bin Laden'. Please start waking up people. Let's at least stop supporting crappy films like this being made.",1,0,6,17 November 2012
Silence," You don't need to be religious to find this film intriguing
","I am not religious and I really don't think you have to be religious to find this film so fascinating.It just so happens to be about Christianity and faith, but one can take the film and relate to it with anything that they're extremely passionate about. For example, rather than religion, what if one was a really passionate soldier fighting for their country, and they end up being captured by the enemy; if they don't burn or spit on their own flag and respect the enemy's culture instead, their family or close friends would be killed. The use of severe torture was a way to get the religious groups to apostatize; this story is extremely relevant in today's society (or any era for that matter) -- think about it, the use of waterboarding can make ANYONE admit they're terrorists. I think it also questions about pride/thinking rationally in certain situations. To some, throwing away your pride and dignity is as good as being dead. It is a catch-22. What also makes this film/story interesting is how people can interpret it completely differently; one can see the behavior as being selfish/cowardly or entirely respectable.First of all, the Old Samurai Inoue (played by Issei Ogata) is fantastic. He just has this bizarre creepiness charm to him, almost like an iconic cartoon character... just has that same presence that Christoph Waltz had in Inglourious Basterds. The Interpreter to Inoue (played by Tadanobu Asano) is also excellent... of course he has the best English out of all the Japanese actors. It's that friendly charm that makes the characters much creepier/deadlier/nastier than the stereotypical villains. The best villains don't believe what they're doing is really wrong. Kichijiro (played by Yosuke Kubozuka) is an absolutely hilarious character. He is like a rat. He seems to portray the typical flaws of being a human. The main character has trouble deciding many times throughout the film, seesawing back and forth on what to do, and Kichijiro's character is always like a mirror metaphor to him.The dialogues between the Samurai/Interpreter/Rodrigues defending Buddha and other metaphors throughout about one seed may grow in one country but dies in another/the land being a swamp is really interesting. At first when I found out the movie was going to be 3 hours, I thought that was going to kill me, but it wasn't bad at all. The beginning is a little slow (they could have cut that whole China part), but it gets really interesting towards the second half. If you're just into mindless fast cutting action films and not so much a deep thinker, this film is not for you. This movie is based on the 1966 historical fiction Japanese novel by Shunsaku Endo. There was also a movie made in 1971, which has some similar scenes, but I definitely prefer Scorsese's version. This should be the real winner for an Oscar, but I'm sure Hollywood loves Hollywood, so they'll end up giving it to LA LA Land instead. Andrew Garfield is really becoming a big star than just a super hero. If you enjoy character study and great dialogue/something that makes you think, definitely watch it. It's really tragic and haunting.",8,0,1,8 February 2017
La La Land," Don't believe the hype too much. Cliché and overrated/bland story. Some nice songs. 'The Artist 2016' 500 Days of Summer is way better!!!!!
","I just watched this a second time. 'Someone in the Crowd' (very catchy and upbeat) and 'City of Stars' (emotional) are clearly the highlight songs of this film. I love those songs. It made me cry the second time watching it, especially when Ryan starts playing 'City of Stars' for Emma. That part is very touching. Sorry, there is no way this movie is a 9/10 (currently), it will definitely go down once the hype dies down. I was excited to see this, but I think it is being over-hyped too much. I think it's better if you go in with low expectations.I understand this movie is 'refreshing' than the typical usual marvel comic super hero movies or animated movies always coming out in theaters, but it's being too over-hyped as if it's the best movie/musical ever. Is everyone not really focusing on the story and just rating on the visual? It's like people criticize Michael Bay films right away because most of his action movies have a cliché generic plot, even though visually, he knows how to show action; well, people seem to forgive the generic storyline of LA LA Land because of the visuals. This is no '500 Days of Summer', that was released in 2009, (now that's a feel good movie from start to finish that breaks some cliché, which is easily a way better film than this/and has a better message)I can't help it but compare this movie to 500 Days because the whole different SEASONS things, it takes place in LA, some musical scenes, about pursuing dreams/romance/what if it happened this way instead and that... BUT, 500 Days of Summer is just a way better solid movie. LA LA Land, underneath the surface, take away all the dancing and nice costumes, just actually feels less magical than 500 Days. This movie also reminds me of 'The Artist', which I'm sure most people have forgotten by now - was a major overrated, over- hyped Oscar win, where it was clearly praised on the visual/technical level/homage, because there really wasn't an interesting plot and the story was just bland and generic. Honestly, who really cares about Oscar wins anymore - the people voting choices are always predictable (Will Smith did not force me to write this); like another dreadful boring overrated movie 'Spotlight' won just because it was controversial subject. This is a musical, so they will randomly start singing like in Disney movies. But the musical parts weren't as memorable, catchy, or exciting as I imagined or was hoping for from all the hype. It doesn't sound like real music, but just actors just trying to sing lines in a musical way. I don't think it's on the same level as Moulin Rouge. It actually came off more comical whenever Ryan Gosling just randomly starts singing. Joseph Gordon-Levitt can sing, but I don't think Ryan Gosling has that singing level. Even though 500 Days of Summer isn't a musical, I enjoyed that film's musical parts, and is way more memorable and feel-good. Griffith Observatory was underwhelming. Also, it's such a waste to see these nice large production sets/extras, yet the camera just pans fast across becoming just a complete motion blur. Again, 500 Days of Summer made LA look beautiful than it really is and felt more memorable. (They made that Angels Knoll park iconic). I just don't remember any memorable moments except the opening freeway, which is impressive on a production level, but it wasn't as legendary classic level or worth the hype, as it just felt out of place just randomly happening in the beginning of the film. Clearly they just wanted to open the film with some sort of big bang, but it's the same as throwing in a Michael Bay action sequence when there's no substance to the story. I was more thinking during that scene, why are we watching these people dance suddenly?I don't feel the romance between Ryan and Emma at all; their chemistry is more like siblings. The director relied too much on Ryan/Emma's 'chemistry reputation' from their previous films together. They're both very talented, but I didn't feel the romance at all. The part where they say 'I love you' to each other was cringe worthy/hard to believe. In fact, for them to get together is extremely forced and cliché in this film. I get the cliché formula already where they act like they hate each other in the beginning, but suddenly fall in love, but this one is so rushed for them to get together. It seems like the story was a second afterthought and the dancing/sets were more of the priority. There's a very ironic line in the film where John Legend says about being stuck in the old (jazz) from the past being a traditionalist won't bring the wave for the future... yet this film still tries to be in the old days of Hollywood. The film was shot in cinemascope; I thought the projection, at the theater I saw this at, was really bad - the colors were so dull/faded - but apparently this was how it was shot.Just out of nowhere 'sell out' John Legend comes to the rescue. And out of nowhere, out of all things on Emma's last audition, where we expect to hear her maybe share about her whole 'magical' experience with Ryan (which may be cheesy), instead she brings up about her aunt!? (which is even cheesier!) Like where did that come from?!! In harsh reality, dreams may come true. The irony in dreams, dreams may not always come true.",6,18,35,17 December 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Ignore the bad ratings/critics, especially the 'gay' fiasco. Magical experience. However, new additional music was unnecessary and poor.

It's honestly not there. There's more direct blatant sex on TV and ads daily all the time, yet there's actually people complaining or spreading this silly false propaganda of a 'gay scene'?And another thing, what the hell are people complaining about Emma Watson's singing? So hard to please people. Yet another ridiculous controversy rumor floating around about 'auto-tune' is another overblown false accusation. Haters are just always haters. Emma is an amazing singer and has a wonderful voice... Jealous, crazy people out there.The first scene when Belle talks to her father, she bends over way too many times... that seemed almost too deliberate and calculated. Josh Gad as Gaston's side kick is spot on. It's very risky and hard to top a classic legendary film, you can't expect this to surpass the original - I mean, nothing is going to take away the original anyway. Obviously it's not perfect, but it's still a nice addition. I enjoyed the set, hearing the classic songs again, totally didn't care for the new songs/new backstory - but it was still a magical experience.",7,1,3,12 June 2017
Sicario," Awful Pacing. SLOW FILM. Del Toro is the only saving grace with one 'badass' scene.
","Make sure you have time to kill and plenty of sleep to pay attention to this film.We've all seen the intense border scene in the trailer that makes us want to watch this film... while there is big anticipation for that scene in the beginning to come on, the drive/parade there takes forever - yet it's quite underwhelming. After that, you must sit through a long dragged on scenes again.Oh, the irony how Emily Blunt is also 'used' more as a fill-in for the film shooting as well. She is not the main star. The whole film she is just CONFUSED the whole time, along with the audience, and it can be really frustrating. The film is very slow pacing and is confusing to a normal viewer with all the military jargon talking heads and rankings involved - unless that's really your thing. Del Toro easily steals the show here and is the most interesting character where you want to know most about. (I believe they're making a sequel to focus more about him) Del Toro's character is like Tom Cruise's Vincent character in Collateral; both characters have a very interesting background where you really want to know more about -- and a major badass coming out of the shadows. You know what would be a really interesting movie? Have Tom Cruise Vincent character go against Del Toro's character - I'd pay to watch that!At the same time it's very Hollywood drama having a single man take people down, cheesy Zero Dark Thirty night vision scene and tunnel. The situation is very illogical and unrealistic, as dramatic as they tried to be. If you are able to stand the slow dragged on confusing beginning, the best scene by far in the movie is with Del Toro near the end with the 'dinner scene' performance. The mood and tone is very tense, but that's the only real thing/worthwhile going for this movie. It's one of those films where things conveniently happen (Like the movie CRASH) to progress the film forward. I'm surprised Richard Roeper considered this the 'best movie of the year'. Oh, we miss Siskel and Ebert The ratings is way too high and I think many are way too bias because of that single Del Toro scene alone. Overall, they dragged it on too much for little depth and pay off. The ending is unsatisfying where it leave you hanging.",5,6,12,16 June 2016
Steve Jobs," A Symphony of Yelling and Arguing
","Be prepared to listen to 2 hours of just constant yelling and arguing. If you have no idea who Steve Jobs, Woz, or know about PC/MAC, this is NOT the film to watch first.I highly recommend Pirates of Silicon Valley (it's a TNT original TV movie first, which is best and entertaining film about Steve Jobs/Bill Gates by far) or even Ashton Kutcher's version 'Jobs' as a MUCH MORE FRIENDLY starter. This film dives you straight to the 'warzone' with just constant arguing. It is NOT a feel good watching experience. In fact, it can add stress to your ears. If you're stressed, this film will just add more stress on top of you. It's just too much. The whole film basically just always takes place backstage a few minutes before the presentations with all these drama thrown at Steve at the last minute prior to the show -- WHICH IS NOT FACTUAL (except for the beginning scene where the 'Hello' error was coming up) -- but simply done for dramatic effect for the movie. Steve has to deal with his wife, daughter, Woz, John Sculley butting heads with ALL of them right before his show, which is a bit ridiculous setup. The film just gets so claustrophobic taking place backstage the whole movie. If you were eager or expecting to see how Steve Jobs developed his products or demonstrating it on stage, you will be disappointed because 90% of the film just takes place backstage arguing with different people. There are no scenes of the actual presentation or building process. The film mainly focuses on Steve after he's fired from Apple/NeXT days and is also focused more on the relationship with his daughter. The movie takes an hour of arguing before we finally get an intriguing scene of Michael Fassbender actually begin to look like Steve Jobs with his iconic turtleneck, jeans, and glasses look along with the iMac; I would have preferred, and I'm sure many would have liked, to see moments like this, which is refreshing, than the arguing parts. Aaron Sorkin, screenwriter for this film, as well as that Facebook movie 'The Social Network' is a writer that puts in WAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY too much ramblings in dialogue. You can tell right away who the writer was because nobody puts in so much damn ramblings into the dialogue like Aaron Sorkin. Does he not know the meaning LESS IS MORE??? It's good to have some balance and break between, but this film is just full of long ramblings where it takes you out of it. It makes Steve Jobs more identical to portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg; we get that they're both geniuses, but the screen writing just makes them ramble on forever. It's really unpleasing experience. OK, we get Steve Jobs likes to argue, but there's a lot of ramblings that just drag on and we want to get to the next part already. I understand the director deliberately used actors that look nothing like the real people. Michael Fassbender looks nothing like Steve, but as an actor, Fassbender always has a powerful presence in films (Yes, he's Magneto). And Seth Rogen looks nothing like Woz, but he was definitely chosen for the goofy light-hearted image; they do capture the overall 'image'. Fassebender began the film like he was trying to portray Bill Gates more, but ironically, in the second half of the film, when he puts on the glasses and jeans look, he gets more convincing as Steve Jobs (the skinny Steve Jobs when he was getting ill) Ashton Kutcher really resembles Steve Jobs facially, but I really like Noah Wyle (Pirates of Silicon Valley) as Steve Job. Another actor I think who looks like Noah Wyle is Christian Bale; Bale would play the perfect jerk roles. Fassenbender, as well as other actors in this film, are more of an abstract portrayal. Again, if you're expecting to see Apple product presentations or the building process or how Steve Jobs got started, etc. this film is not for you. The film is mainly about the relationship of Steve and his daughter and his behaviors (the Apple products themselves all take a backseat) -- all just taking place backstage before the presentations, which was just done for dramatic effect and NOT factual. The film is just entirely an abstract/metaphorical representation of Steve Jobs (including the look of the actors) - not a direct-copy documentary play- by-play.There are some moments that make you chuckle, like the hinting of the iPads, but the ending is just a bit anti-climactic.While 'Pirates of Silicon Valley' is able to show both the brilliant side of Steve Jobs, the dark side, and more of a poor victim against Bill Gates, this film lacks on the brilliance, rather just a complete crazy sociopathic jerk. There were some memorable arguing, like between Steve and Woz, but honestly, there are so many arguing going on in this film, some just drag on and feel pointless (like with his wife where she keeps nagging him about the 28% - over and over and over again). The beginning of the film was shot on 16mm with a very grainy look, middle of the film was shot on 35, and the last scenes were shot on digital with a really crisp look. This movie is basically on the same level as Steven Spielberg's portrayal of Lincoln; if you have no idea who Lincoln was, that movie is not a good starter either, nor did it focus on Lincoln but more on the 13th Amendment (what a boring film that was); like the movie Lincoln, this film also drags on and on with convoluted dialogues and we don't really gain more than what we started with, rather just observing the personality of the character.",4,0,1,19 June 2016
Flight," Incredible Performances! I'm addicted...
","...to this film!Denzel Washington was seriously robbed an Oscar for this role because we all know the Academy is racist... (just kidding? Will Smith/Jada did not force me to say that. Go easy on me). But honestly, Denzel gave so much incredible performance range in this film that the Academy really take him for granted. Daniel Day-Lewis won Oscar that year instead (for playing Lincoln), but it's a shame because, underneath that high quality cosmetic makeup and all, playing Lincoln is just really being a lethargic person! It's really nowhere near Denzel's level of incredible wide range of emotions portrayed in his character, where he so genuinely pulled off in this film. Actually, everyone in this film is fantastic. You will not believe the female actress in this film, Kelly Reilly, is actually British! Wow. Also the guy playing the smoking cancer patient (James Badge Dale), a very memorable powerful scene (he deserves some sort of award just for that scene!), is extremely convincing; it really doesn't seem like he's acting at all! While the beginning flight scene has the most incredible intense action sequence, if you're expecting to see just a film about a pilot and airplanes and have low attention span/just want more action/blowup action/Air Force One film, this is NOT for you. If you enjoy character study and deep psychological discussions, this is for you. This film is about addiction (alcohol and drugs) and has some interesting religious undertone to it. Do things happen for a reason? We all question it. If you are or know someone in denial living a lie, this can be a compelling film for you too. The climax of the film does NOT need any explosions or action to give the viewers an emotional ride - the whole dilemma the character has to face is just very intriguing. This is really a beautiful engaging film. This film is dark, but Zemeckis really knows how to throw in comedy too. There were some cheesy moments (the fridge scene), but overall, it's a very powerful film. Robert Zemeckis is a genius. He also directed Back to the Future and Forrest Gump... Flight is easily another classic. I really love how Robert Zemeckis is not just a director that knows how to make great action and comedy, but really understands and shows the viewers the deeper levels of human emotion.",9,2,4,3 July 2016
The Replacements," Nandesuka!!! FUNNY ASS MOVIE!!!
","This movie was soo funny!! I laughed my ass off espcially when the Sumo guy was on, I know how that Sumo(Jumbo) guy feels when people see asian their first intent is if their Chinese but noo, there are a bunch of kinds of asians! Next time you see an asian atleast for once ask them if their JAPANESE and not Chinese man! Hahaha, anyways back to the movie... The best thing about this movie is the cast which makes you actually want them to win unlike other sports movie with teams that just fights all the time and no fun. This movie is hilarious and even a great story! It has everything... Drama, Romance, Comedy (especially)... You have to see this movie if you haven't!Overall rating: 9/10",8,0,1,10 August 2001
A Walk to Remember," Popular school jerk and good'o nerdy Mandy falls in love.
","Oh my god, is this another teen movie? A typical popular guy goes out with a supposably 'nerdy'(at least take away all her makeup) girl and all of a sudden they fall in love with each other. Hmm, what a shocker! Can't those writers think of something different for a change? Almost every problem is resolved in the movie like a 30 minute T.V show. C'mon! Can it get any cornier? Yes it can...----- SPOILER ALERT -----When Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) and Landon Carter (Shane West) finally ends up dating and things are going fine for them Jamie confesses she has cancer. Psh, give me a break! They just couldn't think of anything else could they? Hell, she should of just said 'I'm actually a guy.' That would of made the story more interesting! Jeez! Or at least she should of gotten shot or something which would been more dramatic and would of made some Anti-Mandy fans happy.(Just kidding) Why was she so healthy in the beginning and then all of a sudden she just becomes really sick after she confesses? Can this movie get any more lame? Of course, why stop now? What happens next? Believe it or not they get married and yet again she looks healthy then.----- SPOILER END -----Thankfully Mandy Moore's acting wasn't as horrible as the movie. Mandy, you're 2 for 2... being in bad movies, Princess Diaries and now this. It's also really hard to believe Mandy as a 'nerdy' nice girl when she played a popular evil cheerleader in her previous movie.Another thought, Why is Mandy listening to her own music in her car during the movie? I thought that was weird. And at one point during the movie, Mandy sang for like 5 minutes straight! What is this Glitter?!Very unoriginal, unemotional, corny movie.Overall Rating: 5/10",5,0,2,6 July 2002
Sin City," SOO OVERRATED and repetitive.
","This film is so STYLE over substance. People are being deceived; I mean, I can see why it can be a hit because of the innovative film noir modern comic production design special effects this film accomplished... And all-star cast...but other than that, the shooting and constant over-the-top head chopping off gets so damn repetitive, it completely loses its excitement... it's just comical and there's no real thrill... the story is not that engaging either. I watched Sin City 2 first in 3D and the story in that one flowed a lot better and was more engaging... simple, but engaging... Sin City drags so much. Pass.",4,1,3,15 August 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," 8.1 Rating?!?! Seriously people? IMDb has been taken over by dumb millennials
","Wow. Just wow. 8.1??? Most superficial film ever. The ones who gave low ratings speak the real truth... this film really has no characters to really care for and there really is no story at all...The little girl flashbacks Mad Max was having??? Pointless. It's just chase/running away and then they decide to head back and chase/run again! Seriously??????I guess people don't really care about stories anymore. I heard the action was supposed to be impressive, but even that wasn't worthy of the hype or praise. Water World has way better action and is more interesting. The pacing is horrible. It's so repetitive and boring. Production set/value alone doesn't make a movie deserve a 8/10... ridiculous. One of the worst most overrated movies ever.",1,7,10,15 July 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Overrated. Prequel to Silence? Andrew Garfield plays EXACT religious role
","It's really odd Andrew Garfield stars in this film playing a passionate religious guy (and it also happens to be against the Japanese) - the same exact character/circumstance for him starring, and released the same time, as Martin Scorsese's 'Silence' film. In the film 'Silence', he refuses to step on the cross of Jesus. In 'Hacksaw Ridge', he refuses to hold a rifle because he does not believe in killing/ten commandment. In both films, he faces a dilemma on what he passionately believes can also cost the lives of others. The true story is inspiring, but the film, when it comes to the production/presentation, it is more of a video game comedy, cliché, typical Hollywood making all over it. This is definitely no 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Letters from Iwo Jima'. 'Letters from Iwo Jima', directed by Clint Eastwood, is a much more powerful production (his other film, 'American Sniper' was horrible, though). I don't really care for war movies but 'Letters from Iwo Jima' really was engaging. 'Hacksaw Ridge' is really on the same level as 'American Sniper' - the ending presentation is even the same. The battle scenes are shot more like video games and it is overly dragging. They're both overrated films, honestly. The CG effects are just plain awful. It seems like they hired a really poor special effects team or didn't have the budget for the Battleship Navy firing the missiles - it just looks like a video game CG and it looks so horrible/out-of- place. It would look so much better if they just go back to the old school life- like miniature models and fire actual explosives on it; that would honestly would look better and more believable... CG totally takes you out of the film. I'm sure kids these days playing Call of Duty or whatever war game is out would watch this and think the battle scenes are 'cool' and give the movie an immediate 10 rating.....Personally, ever since 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Black Hawk Down', there hasn't really been a revolutionary cinematography of a war zone. This film just doesn't have that authentic realism feel but more over-the-top (Vince Vaughn as a Sergeant) Hollywood presentation and just video-game cliché scenarios (kicking grenades/using dead body as a shield while machine gunning everyone). It has a current rating of 8.3/10. This film is definitely not a 10. It's a 6 at best (I'm giving it a 5), only because the true story is rather touching. The film is really cliché (show flashback of being a kid, meets girl/wife, starts out training in camp, go to battle.) and it really doesn't add anything new to war movies production wise or storytelling, other than that single plot point being a medic who doesn't want to fire a gun. The whole camp scene in the beginning is a rather drag, that's been done better in 'Full Metal Jacket'. I know Vince Vaughn is added as a comedic element humor to the film, but it really takes away the seriousness of the film. The whole subplot of his drunken father, the wife, it feels more like a TV episode that feels incomplete... the film just feels like not much really happened and feels rushed. The battle scenes drag on too long as well. It's an OK war movie, but definitely not Oscar-worthy or to be considered one of the greatest war movies of all- time.",5,3,8,23 February 2017
