Captain Phillips," Film of the Year
","Wow, this movie is magnificent on so many levels. Here's why.1) It takes place on the water, so we already know it's going to be visually stunning 2) Tom Hanks is flawless as Captain Phillips and will be, at the very least, nominated for another Oscar 3) The portrayal of the US Military is unbelievableIn my opinion, the movie never lets up. I've read other reviews with people saying the exciting parts are in the beginning and the end. Well I felt like I couldn't breathe in the theater because I thought I would miss out on something.After seeing prisoners and gravity, I was already content with the quality of movies this year. But this one takes the cake. Captain Phillips is the best movie I've seen in years. Don't wait, go see it in the theater.",10,2,5,18 October 2013
