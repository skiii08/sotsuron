Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'Phantom Menace' replaces 'Return of the Jedi' as the weakest Star Wars film.
","From the goofy and rubber mouthed Jar Jar to the inane and hollow dialog, this movie stinks.  Everything in it feels tacked on from the previous 'Star Wars' movies.  Many of the creatures are CG animations and they all feel out of place.  The interaction between the real-life actors and the animated creatures looks fake.  It's incredibly embarrassing.  And just about every scene contains the hyper annoying Jar Jar Binks.  He really ruins every scene he's in.  It's 'Meesaa!'  this and 'Meesaa!' that.  He trips over everything and makes the whole film unpleasant to watch.  And why does every alien have an earth-type accent?  It makes absolutely no sense at all. 
I really loved the Star Wars films.  I grew up on them.  They were really wonderful, well written, and spurred endless imagination.  Episode One is just a hollow spin-off of the originals.  Even if it weren't compared to the previous films it would still be nothing more than a really bad movie with really good special effects.  It's like one of those goofy Disney sci-fi movies that you never see in the theater and always regretfully see on cable.",Null,0,1,25 November 2001
Event Horizon," The latest 'Edsel' of sci-fi/horror shlock.
","'Event Horizon' is just another big, loud, dumb movie.  It's a text-book example of how 'not' to make a film.  Gear up a great cast; send them into space with some pricey Hollywood special effects; and then let it all spiral down a hole about as deep and interesting as a shallow pot-hole.Remember 'The Black Hole'?  'Event Horizon' perfectly mirrors what 'The Black Hole' did wrong almost 20 years ago.  The evil that surrounds the mysterious Event Horizon ghost-ship is nothing more than a vague notion of hell.  O.k., so the laws of physics have been broken a little.  So what? Does that deserve eternal torture on a spinning gravity chair?  We never get to see the mysterious dimension that supposedly houses this horrendous evil. We never get to see what faster-than-light travel looks like.  The visions of 'hell' each crew member faces, are cut so quickly, so sporadically, and so loudly, that the whole thing simulates a form of visual electro-shock therapy.  It's all very unpleasant and uninteresting.The only thing I found remotely enjoyable was Dr. Weir's (Sam Neill) explanation of his 'dimensional drive'.  Unfortunately, it's all cut short by lame banter from the crew in the form of, 'Com'on Doc! Speak English!' Wow.  Talk about a shortcut to nowhere.   It would appear that the writers made a dimensional jump to mediocre, unimaginative, audience condescension hell.Do yourself a favor and rent 'In The Mouth Of Madness' instead.  You'll thank me later.",3,2,4,16 March 2003
Cube," Not since first seeing the early Twilight Zone episodes have I shivered like this.
","Ahh, the dread, the suffering.  Oops, wrong cube movie.This movie truly frightened me.  Not since first seeing the early Twilight Zone episodes have I shivered like this. In fact, I do believe that 'CUBE' gracefully takes its inspiration from one of my favorite episodes in which a Major, a Dancer, a Clown, a Bagpipe player, and a Farmer all find themselves inside a container of nothing and are forced to ponder their existence.  It's a wonderfully terrifying episode I will never forget.In 'CUBE', our poor cast has the daunting task of travelling through an endless series of traps, each designed to inflict a horrible death upon execution.  Some rooms appear safe, while others are simply lethal.  The faceless, ultra-efficient machine-traps chill the soul while the mysterious purpose of the entire situation staggers the imagination.It forces its occupants to ask the fundamental question of 'why'. Why am I here?  Why would anyone create such a monstrous place?  How can existence be so horribly unforgiving?  Is there an exit?  Is it even worth attempting to find an exit?  Is it testing intelligence?  Is it some sadistic rich millionaires idea of fun?  Or is this literally Hell?It is the unknown, personified by the Cube, which makes it so terrifying. It brandishes its own version of reality in plain sight while remaining ultimately mystifying. The two working together, set the stage for a truly memorable and horrifying film.",Null,0,0,3 March 1999
