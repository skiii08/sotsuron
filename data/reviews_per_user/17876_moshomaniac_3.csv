Blade Runner 2049," A sequel to a Sci Fi Classic, much delayed, that kind of disappoints
","As I'm writing this, I say with a heavy heart I was a little disappointed in this film. I wanted to like this film. I really did. But the film has some problems that hinder the full enjoyment. Allow me to elaborate. The biggest problem is the length. The first Blade Runner from 1982 clocks in at only about an hour and a half. Blade Runner 2049, by contrast is almost 3 hours long, a bit too long for a film with such a laborious pace. The first one is very sluggish in its pace, but makes up for it with atmosphere. Blade Runner 2049 seems to take it time at inappropriate moments: in a scene where the main character is looking for Rick Deckard, it takes 15 minutes when it could have just as easily take only 5. 
Onto the look of the film. As a visual film, Blade Runner 2049 is stunning. Absolutely beautiful to look at. The gloomy and depressing atmosphere is overpoweringly gorgeous. That is a definite plus. The production designers deserve to win Oscars. What about the story? Well, here goes:
The rogue Nexus 6 replicants have been obliterated, and a new generation has come out that seems (mostly) compliant, used for slave labor and servitude. The main character, known only as 'K', is trying to locate Rick Deckard(Harrison Ford), as they have found the dead body of Rachel(Sean Young), and have discovered that replicants, although told they are inferior, have the ability to have offspring(it is obvious from the corpse she died in childbirth), in this case, Deckard and Rachel's offspring. Afraid of what this discovery will do if word of it gets out to the replicant community, they send K to kill him. Interesting premise, but the problem here is that there are far too many slow moments. The first movie was slow, but it at least had something interesting to look at, so I was never bored. This film by has too much nothing in it, and is often boring. 
The acting is pretty solid. I always love to see Harrison Ford in any movie, and the actor who played the main character, Ryan Gosling, did a pretty likable job, too, as did the rest of the cast. One particular standout was Ana De Armas, as K's holographic roommate. A very touching scene is featured where she tries to make love to him, in a sense, when she hires a prostitute and superimposes her image over her. I know it sounds kind of lewd, but in the picture, it is a very sweet and moving segment, done in a surprisingly tasteful way.
That being said, I'd love to give this movie a second watch. I'm hoping I will warm up to it more. Overall, Blade Runner 2049 isn't as memorable as the first film, but it will likely be destined to be a cult classic just like the first, as it offers so many intriguing themes. It just needed to be a bit shorter.",7,1,3,18 December 2017
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the Lost Ark: A tribute to the film serials of the 1940s, and one of the all-time greatest movies
","In writing this review, I'll say at the very beginning, I love this movie. It reigns supreme as my all-time favorite. Conceived by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, this movie, released in June of 1981(a month before I was born) was an instant box-office smash, giving birth to Indiana Jones, played to perfection by Harrison Ford, coming off his success from Star Wars(1977) and Empire Strikes Back(1980). The film captures the spirit of the Saturday Matinee with an absolute brilliance. It action-packed, it's funny, it has fantastic visuals, great acting all around, it is a winner in every regard. Released 3 years prior to the PG-13 rating, the film does contain some scenes of fairly intense gore and blood (which would probably warrant a PG-13 today), but I think that a mature 11 year old can probably handle it. I also must mention the score, done by John Williams, the 'Raiders March' is quite possibly the most exciting and invigorating score I've ever heard, instantly establishing the film's adventurous tone, and the theme for the ark of the covenant is mysterious and wrought with intrigue. Its interesting also to note that the submarine from 1981's DAS BOOT(directed by Wolfgang Peterson of The Never-ending Story) was rented for one scene. Indiana Jones became of the most recognizable characters of the 1980s, and the original fedora was donated to the Smithsonian. Overall, Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of Steven Spielberg's best films, and a great American classic that no video collection should be without. 3 sequels followed: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom(1984); Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade(1989); and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull(2008); but none truly captured the spirit of the Saturday Matinee more than this essential classic. What more can be said except, if you haven't seen this, check it out!",10,1,2,28 January 2018
Blade Runner," A Dystopian Masterpiece that stands up 30 years after its original release.
","Based (very loosely) on Philip K Dick's novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep', Blade Runner concerns Rick Deckard(Harrison Ford), a retired cop who is yanked out of retirement when 6 rogue androids, called replicants, make it from an off-world colony into 21st Century Los Angelos. Their crime: wanting to be human. 
So much about this film is iconic: the dystopian cityscapes, the score by Vangelis, the 'tears in the rain' speech, adlibbed by Rutger Hauer, who plays Roy Batty, the leader of the band of Replicants who tries to go to the Tyrell Corporation(the company that makes Replicants) in a desperate gamble to prolong their life-span, the list goes on and on. Blade Runner, though a commercial failure during its initial release, was re-evaluated and rightfully proclaimed one of the all-time greatest Sci-fi movies. The film is extremely slow-moving, but never boring and uninvolving, and the story, while a tad scarce makes up for it in atmosphere and character development. Very rarely has a movie been made with such skill, and the sets of 2019 L.A. are a collaborative knockout. Blade Runner has become one of the most influential movies in the last 3 decades, inspiring movies, writers, and videogames alike, and in 1993, it was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress' national film registry. Though Philip K. Dick has been gone since 1986, his legacy continues to this very day, and Blade Runner is definitely one of the prime reasons for that.",10,1,2,18 December 2017
