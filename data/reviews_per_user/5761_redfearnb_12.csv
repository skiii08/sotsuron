Scarface," It really didn't do it for me.
","What's the big deal with this movie? I read about it and heard about it all my life, but I have finally taken the time to watch it. Thankfully it was edited, but basically that just meant that the 'F-word' is blanked out, although there is definitely no imagination as to what is being said. Talk about violent, holy snap. I really don't see any reason why I would waste my time watching this movie again.So plenty of people say this is a very revolutionary film. How? There are plenty of good points, I just don't see how they are worth it. All the gangsters and the Hollywood stars love the movie too. I just think its all hype and no show. There are a unlimited amounts of poor effects and graphics. After two hours of this movie, I couldn't wait for it to end.Okay, enough of tearing the movie down. The gangster mentality from Tony Montana (Al Pacino) and the showy character is awesome. He definitely pulls it off like no other could. He rages constantly and just blows up if anything happens at all. It's nice to see that by the end of the movie, Tony loses and is destroyed by himself. His Cuban portrayal is pretty good, I'll have to admit, although his accent isn't all that good. All of the supporting characters do very well in reacting to Tony, especially in fear. Eventually, Tony basically kills everyone in the whole movie, so he gets what was coming to him.Oh yeah, the houses are really cool too. Money can buy you anything is such a great theme for a gangster movie.",6,1,3,23 March 2006
Troy," Nice interpretation of the poem by Homer.
","I mostly was interested in watching this movie because I am supposed to be reading the Odyssey right now in English. Troy is all about two things: Achilles (Brady Pitt) and war. Which also means two other things are featured in this movie: gore and sex. Now first off, there isn't any sex going on in the movie. You get plenty of shots of Pitt's butt and of the girls he sleeps with wrapped in sheets, but there isn't anything that bad. However, the gore is definitely there. I'd say it isn't as intense as a movie like Saving Private Ryan, but there are plenty of dead bodies. What would you expect from a ten year long war?The movie had some interesting artistic interpretations involved with it. Some things the screenwriters portrayed were completely different from anything that I had previously conceived in my mind, which still did not detract from the story. I would love to see these folks do a continuation of this story connecting with the Odyssey. The effects are great, especially in the rendering of the massive armies as they fight. I wasn't completely thrilled to have nothing but Pitt featured in the movie, but he is the hero who falls at the end of the movie, so I can understand why it is that way.All in all, its a good movie, even at the almost four hour length. You might need a short break in the middle of the movie to survive it, but if you are watching it on TiVo, then you don't have to worry about pausing the movie. Since it runs along the lines of Gladiator, I don't see how the TV version could differ much from the DVD.",8,5,10,18 March 2006
Glory," Second best Civil War movie of all time.
","I am a great fan of history and especially of the different war stories. However, my favorite movie about the Civil War is 'Gettysburg.' Now I can say that my second favorite movie about the Civil War is 'Glory.'There is a long tradition of every war-based movie being very lengthly and seeming to last forever, but Glory didn't pass the 'patience' line to where I am looking at my watch all the time and wondering how much longer the movie will last. This is the first look at the contribution of black soldiers to the Civil War, that I know of, and is finely accomplished.Colonel Shaw (Mattew Broderick) is the only actor I didn't like. He doesn't seem to fit the role very well and his mustache and/or facial hair is often falling off of his face. Maybe Broderick should have grown out his hair a little longer. All of the other actors do a very fine job and are very impressive. No complaints other than that. Very good movie, it is edited down to PG, so there is hardly a scene one can complain about while watching. No gory battles where limbs go flying every direction, but there one hospital scene where the implied result of war wounds is VERY vivid.",8,0,1,31 March 2006
Meet the Fockers," Not much of a story, but the humor makes it worth it!
","This film was SO stinking hilarious, I loved every minute of it. Although there are some people I definitely would not feel comfortable watching this movie with because of the many sexual jokes and references, it was hilarious watching it with my dad. I was amazed that De Niro could keep his mouth clean for the whole movie without saying the 'F-word' even once. I was almost shocked, .I have always been a fan of Stiller and his comedy, but the complement of other actors works so well for the movie. They play off each other and the running jokes throughout the movie are very entertaining. My favorite part of the movie was how De Niro, as the dominant male of the movie, takes control of everything and tries to manipulate everyone to do what he wants. He also tries to make everything around him, including the young child and his cat, all super-spy's to follow in his path.So buckle down for some seriously funny sexual humor and you are in for a hilarious ride with Meet the Fockers. What else would you expect from a character named Gaylord Focker, who is a nurse?",7,0,0,19 March 2006
The Incredibles," The Incredibles is another wholesome movie from Pixar.
","The Incredibles was a good old fashioned family computer generated graphics movie. The target audience for the film is easily identifiable, but that still does not take the humor and enjoyment away from us older folks.Mr. Incredible does a great job with never letting go of his desire to be a big buff manly man and so becomes the hero of the movie, but how his entire family becomes involved with him in the process is pretty creative. I will have to say that the very end of the movie was a bit dumb, however.Pixar is totally, obviously, no doubt at all, hoping that this movie will offer a sequel in the near future with an emphasis placed on the developing powers of the youngest child of the family. However entertaining this might be, and there definitely is some potential for it, they did not have to make it so blatantly obvious in the movie.It is a bit different judging a movie when the merits of the actors are basically dependent on the abilities of the graphics designers to convey feeling and fluid motion. I have not seen a bad movie from Pixar, and my expectations were not let down this time either. Its just a plain good movie, fun and funny throughout, with nothing bad for the little kids to see.",7,0,0,15 March 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," There was promise, but its just too dirty for me.
","So there is a lot of cult movie hype about how great Kill Bill is.....well, the first scene was just a shot of Uma Therman's incredibly beat up face which put a bad taste in my mouth. I gave it some time to get going, but all in all, this, even in its edited form, was such a violently grotesque movie, that I quickly decided it was not for me. I even had TiVo-ed Vol. 2 of the series, but if its anything like the first volume, I don't want anything to do with it. Sure there are plenty of violent movies, but this is just plain gross. So if you ask me, I wouldn't ever ever ever recommend it. I doubt there will be a cleaner version of it too, because it appears that the whole movie is going to be grossly violent. Who likes to look at Uma Therman, anyway? She freaks me out without portraying a white trash assassin in a movie.Of course I can see how this is very much a homage to the old-school 70's era martial arts movies, but I just cannot get past the blatant violence. I'm all for realism, but do I really need to know exactly what it is like to see hundreds of people killed all in different ways? The answer is no, thank you.",1,30,59,19 September 2006
Ray," Great documentary of this musical legend!
","I really liked this movie and was very surprised at how well Jamie Foxx did in executing the role of Ray Charles. I had only seen Ray Charles in concert one time before he passed away, but Foxx did a great job of copying his mannerisms and singing along with the audio tracks from Charles. I did not know a lot about the life of Charles, so this movie was also an eye opening experience to his hardships and journey in life, though the womanizing and drug addiction was definitely not a surprise to me. I really liked the recurring nightmares that Charles experienced through his life about his younger brother who died as a young boy.So its pretty much a documentary, being a biographical movie and all, and is a very good depiction of it. Once again, Foxx amazed me with his acting and the mannerisms of Charles which he copied almost flawlessly. Great movie for anyone!",8,0,1,18 March 2006
Bruce Almighty," 'You wanna see a miracle son? Be the miracle.'
","'You wanna see a miracle son? Be the miracle.' That is the premise of Bruce Almighty. Although I was somewhat hesitant about what I have heard of this movie at first, it turned out to be pretty darn good. Bruce (Jim Carrey), an aspiring TV anchorman, goes through life struggling and blames all of his misfortunes on God. Bruce then meets God (Morgan Freeman) and is given his powers for a time. Bruce then uses these powers to his own advantage to raise himself, but ends up losing his girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston), in the process. It is only after losing the woman that he loves so much that Bruce realizes what he really wants in life and gives in to the will of God. Then he regains the love of Grace and succeeds in his work life as well.At first, this movie seemed somewhat sacrilegious as Bruce goes around doing whatever he wants in the world, but the movie ends up having some very true, and very strong lessons to it. I especially like the play on words with Grace being the name of Bruce's girlfriend, but also being the only thing that he wants from God by the end of the movie. The line about being the miracle is especially true as many people thing that all they have to do is sit back and everything will be taken care of the way they would like it. So get up, do something, and make your life what you want it to be!Bruce Almighty is a good movie that is funny, but also solemn when appropriate. The TV version has some extra editing to it, which kept it a little cleaner as well, which I liked.",7,0,1,16 March 2006
Casino Royale," Different from the others.......and AWESOME!
","Wow. WOW. WOOOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!This was certainly a departure from the earlier 20 bond films, but man did I love it. My fiancée said that it was quite violent and bloody to her, but I did not find it graphic personally. The plot is simple, yet complex. The twists and turns I expected, but could not see coming, so I was never bored. The explosions and chases and everything were wonderful. There was only one scene that I remember where the CGI bothered me, and it was a background on a yacht. I would certainly recommend, even return to view this movie myself, 100 times. It was just absolutely wonderful and so different that I could not get enough of it. I look forward to any other movies that follow this 'return to the books' feeling of James Bond.I almost never give a movie a 10 out of 10 rating, but I was so surprised to delight that I have to give this movie the highest rating. If you haven't seen it, you better leave your house right now and go wait for a showing to start.",10,3,5,27 November 2006
Gladiator," Gladiator vs. Evil Emperor....oh yeah, this movie rocks!
","Oh man, Gladiator is the best movie I have ever seen that takes place in the era of the Roman Empire. It's not just because I am a guy and there is lots of fighting and killing and manly stuff. The tension and dynamics between Maximus (Russell Crowe) and Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is so think you can taste it. Phoenix is such an awesome evil character in this movie and Crowe epitomizes the ideals of a military republican, dedicated to his country and leaders, fighting for what is right.The only thing that I could complain about is I'm not sure how gore-laden nor vulgar the non-TV version is, but I'd definitely watch the edited version because who needs all that extra junk that makes the DVD R-rated in the first place?!I could write for days about how many great things are included in this movie, but I'll just keep it short and say that it ROCKS!",9,0,1,27 March 2006
Cinderella Man," The emotion is overwhelmingly real, based on a true family story. Awesome!
","What an amazing movie. A drama full of every imaginable emotion. Boxing is quite an interesting sport. I've never really enjoyed its brutality, but I have to admire the boxers for their fitness and determination. I suppose it takes a different kind of man than myself to be a boxer. Cinderella Man contains all of the clichéd aspects of a classic boxing movie. The family is struggling to survive while the wife never approves of what her husband is doing, the underdog rises again to reclaim his glory, and the suspenseful fights keep you guessing who will win. The difference, however, is that this movie is based on a real man who experienced all of these things first hand. The delicate feelings and subtle changes of everyday life make the movie very real. I enjoyed the music the most in this movie. Crowe has always been a favorite actor of mine and while I don't like Zellweger, she played a good role nonetheless. I'll admit that I was pretty choked up throughout the movie and it wasn't just because I'm sick. The last thing that I really have to mention is the occasional, but not too frequent, use of the first-person camera angle. When it is used, its very, very impactive. Once again, it is an awesome movie and everyone should see it.",9,2,3,14 March 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Hilarious, but crude
","It was not surprising that this movie was crude, with bad language and lots of sexual references, so be prepared going in to feel like you are watching Saturday Night Live.The movie was so funny, I could not stop laughing throughout the movie. I had been really looking forward to the release of the movie for several weeks and was not disappointed by what was presented. I felt the movie kept progressing so that I did not feel bored. I usually find myself going into a movie, looking at my watch at some points to see how much time is left, but that didn't happen here.As for acting, the cast is great. Once again, it is a Saturday Night Live flavored movie, which is definitely apparent by the type of humor. There were several scenes from the previews that were not included in the movie, so I am looking forward to an Extended Edition DVD release in a few months. All in all, I'll definitely be seeing it again and again.",9,2,6,3 August 2006
