Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good idea, not executed as well as it could have been
","I have two main problems with this movie. Number one, I think we all know what this one is, Jar Jar. I don't think Jar Jar is bad in all scene, in fact, there are two scenes I actually genuinely find funny. Other than those, he just gets redundant and annoying, and just pointless. The second thing is the Trade Federation. They are trying to get the queen to sign a treaty to make their invasion legal. There is no way to defend this, that is just plain stupid. I don't mind the politics, it's just the fact that the whole storyline is based on taxes and treaties and that crap. The overall storyline moves pretty fast and is relatively exciting. This movie has good effects (for the most part) and has really cool action scenes. There are some line deliveries that the respective actor kind-of butchered, it's not bad, the lines are just stale and dull. The only actors that applies to though are Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman, but I think they do fine. I don't hate Jake Lloyd as young Anakin, I think he actually perfectly shows what would be a kid Darth Vader. Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Ray Parker all do fantastic in their roles. Ray Parker makes an excellent Darth Maul. I am also a big fan of Darth Maul. So, it is an exciting, and I would say good movie, it just has some dumb things sprinkled in their.",8,33,50,15 July 2017
Wonder Woman," Excellent movie, great fun
","This movie has an incredible, riveting story and fantastic performances. Gal Gadot's and Chris Pine's chemistry is flawless and believable. The story was exciting and doesn't let up. The music is really good. If you've seen Batman v Superman(which you should), the Wonder Woman theme from that movie has returned, but it is used appropriately and is badass whenever it plays. The theme plays a total of 3 times throughout the film, and isn't used when it shouldn't be. It also has something that Batman versus Superman lacked, comedy. This movie is very funny, it's not as funny as a Marvel movie, but it has enough that the film benefits from it and doesn't ruin the tone of the film. Speaking of tone, it is still as dark as a DC movie, it has death throughout it, but the humor keeps it fun. You should definitely see this film, it is a fun ride that you won't forget.",10,8,17,14 July 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Watch Extended cut, not theatrical
","The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well.",10,246,301,14 July 2017
