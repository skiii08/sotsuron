Kill Bill: Vol. 2," movie industry greed has struck again
",don't get me wrong. I liked the movie and loved all the movies it was inspired from.  When we are asked to come back a few months later to see the ending of a great vol.1 I am game. When we sit thru 137 minutes of decent pacing I suddenly realize that hey this would have been a citizen kane of martial art flicks if only we we allowed to see the 3 hr version all at once! Trim a bit of flick lets see it all at once and we have a flix that tops/matches pulp fiction. But then again it is a business first and fore most.,7,0,1,1 May 2004
