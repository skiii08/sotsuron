Howl's Moving Castle," Too focused on physical beauty and age-ism
","Like most of Miyazaki's work, this is a visually stunning world with lots of inventiveness displayed in character design, architecture, and back-story.The physical layout is annoyingly trapped in clichÃ©s that don't work on a logical level: we're asked to accept the legitimacy of a KINGdom (have we all forgotten that our forefathers worked hard to drag us out from under kings into democracy???), war for war's sake, steam-punk aircraft that wouldn't work in a real world, and pseudo-victorianism.The most painful pills to swallow, though, are the sexism, and the revolting tie-ins between youth, physical beauty, and beauty of the spirit. Anyone less than physically perfect and young will be outraged by Miyazaki's indefensible tying together of youth, beauty, and kindness. In Miyazaki's world, as in most Japanese anime, goodhearted characters are not permitted to be ugly, and vice versa. Old age is ridiculed nonstop throughout the film.The film is sexist in the sense that women's chief preoccupation is romance, housekeeping, frilly hats, and child-rearing, while men are portrayed as warmongering metrosexual tin soldiers.The dubbing into English goes fairly well, though the original Japanese is so curt that the voice actors clearly struggle to say their lines rapidly, thereby losing much of the emotional inflection that the lines deserve.There's also an embarrassing oversight in the voice casting: one character magically becomes old and young versions of itself (without time travel), and when the age alters, the accent stupidly switches from British to American. The voice casting was sloppy-- it should have kept the accent uniform.",6,0,1,21 December 2009
Cars," *yawn* predictable, stereotyped, and limited
","The film's characters go through almost no character development, except for two very obvious, predictable changes. Every part of the plot can be guessed from the outset. The ethnic stereotyping, too, is both predictable ...and slightly offensive as well.And let's face it... a car presents very little opportunity for animation and anthropomorphism. It doesn't have arms and legs to gesture with, nor much flex in its body. Aside from eyes and mouth, there's very little in the way of animation going on here....and the movie suffers for it.I'm hoping that this, the last movie Pixer is contracted to do for Disney, was just a half-hearted gesture to complete the contractual obligations. Pixar has done some wonderful stuff in the past, but this is a definite four or five levels below previous work in storyline, characterization, and animation. In scenery, however, it is impressive and above Pixar's previous work-- the ground, particularly when Mater's hood falls off a cliff, is very real-looking.",4,3,8,9 November 2006
I Am Legend," Shame on the neocon evangelical marketing weenies who made this.
","The name 'Will Smith' on a movie marquee now means to me, 'give me my money back, if you're gonna make me watch your commercials, dammit!' This film starts with a fairly good premise-- that a cancer cure causes massive deaths, leaving some uninfected people alive but torturously alone. After that, it rapidly sinks into insulting the audience and waving its dumb neo-conservative, pro-military, two-dimensional, evangelical Christian message at us until we want to beat the producers to death with broken glass and wooden furniture.Will Smith starts out by trying to sell the audience a sports car, with needless closeups of its logo. Man, didn't I already PAY for this film at the DAMNED DOOR??? Gimme my money back! Then there's the needless ego-stroking: Will Smith is a 'hero' on Time Magazine's cover... for what? He's a military medical man, not the (Emma Thompson) character who invented this cure for cancer. In fact, it turns out that he's widely known as the person who released the malignant version of this retro-virus... yet no characters blame him or wish him ill.The sheer coincidence that he's a) famous, b) the guy who released the retro-virus into New York City's general population, c) immune, and d) working on a cure...just kills the believability of the film at the start.The CGI effects of the abandoned city are effective, but the monsters are... pathetic. The overstretched mouth during a scream is a tired re-do of the Mummy's scream in the Brendan Frasier film 'Hamunaptra'. The fact that the monsters don't starve and don't freeze to death in winter is pure silliness. The sheer energy and superhuman strength of the monsters is a believability-killer for anyone over the age of 5.Worst, the film becomes offensive and moronic in its pushiness about Christianity, pro-military stance, and flag-waving. By the time we're shown a town of survivors in Small Town America, with high walls, a big church, and an American flag in front of EVERY home, the audience was either actively booing or looking like they were sitting through unanaesthetized dental work.Shame. On. These. Movie makers.",2,2,4,29 January 2008
The Dark Knight," Mediocre summer popcorn movie with warped morals
","In reality, I give this film a score of '4 out of 10', but the one-star rating you see above is intended to balance out the obvious shill vote (marketing hype, 'astroturf', 10/10 votes and comments by paid-for marketing weenies posing as real, unbiased people).At the time of this writing, the film has a 9.7-out-of-10 rating which it clearly does not in any sense deserve. It merits half that rating.I saw 'Batman' last night. 2.5 hours meant that one gets one's money's worth, but heck... it's not half as good as advertisers and IMDb.com would have us believe. The plot line drags, the characters are shallow, the morality is deeply confused and wildly warped.The 'dark knight' is more like a dim bulb.It's hard to believe in Heath Ledger as the Joker. He's just too broad in the face, one-dimensional in this role, and weighed down by poor writing. His makeup was supposed to be degrading throughout the film, but there were obvious touch-ups and clean-ups that reminded the audience 'this is make-believe.' His garb was supposed to be purple-on-green, but was so dark as to look like a black suit. His actions were so reckless that we, as an audience, were constantly reminded that 'this ain't even close to reality. Even a toddler wouldn't believe that this scheme would leave The Joker alive and thriving.'Worse, we're given zero back-story to help us believe that The Joker's feelings and craziness are based on something. In fact, the film goes far out of its way to emphasize that The Joker has no past, no legitimate reason for his hatred and aggression, and is simply not understandable. To that, I say 'Go back to scriptwriting school, and take a few psychology classes while you're there. A character isn't menacing or intriguing unless we see the mechanism driving the emotions.'Worse, Christian Bale as Batman. Christian Bale, though good at dieting and working out, has all the humanity and emotiveness of rotting firewood. Without a sound track, sure, he'd do well as a male model. As a actor, though, he's just taking up space on the screen. Worse, his lisping (with obvious sound effects to lower and strengthen his voice) make him unbelievable as Batman and as perfectionist billionaire.Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) gave an unemotive performance. Worse, he seemed to be struggling with his accent so much that he had no time for other aspects of acting. This is NOT the caliber of performance that he delivered for 'Leon' ('The Professional') and 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'. This was an obvious potboiler, walk-on-and-take-the-money performance.Likewise for all the other performers except hyperactive Heath Ledger and a small one-dimensional part played by the wife of one character. I felt no emotion from any of the other actors and actresses, despite the big ups and downs in the plot line. Dammit, if your daddy dies or you quit your lifelong job, y'oughta look a little broken up!With two exceptions, the special effects did nothing for me: 1) I felt a bit of adrenalin when Batman was standing on a ledge atop a skyscraper while the camera looked over his shoulder into the street. 2) Harvey Two-face's mask was well done: that gets a thumbs up, though I wouldn't want kids seeing it or they'll have nightmares.A few scenes just left me scratching my head, saying 'that would never happen; that's beyond stupid, even for a cartoon movie.' When Batman glides down from one building on his wings, darn it, the wings should look full of air like a parachute, not luffing like a sail pointed in the wrong direction!Even the love interest was a bit bland. They found a frumpy, not-too-pretty woman to play Batman's love-of-his-life, and apparently asked her to play her role as though nothing-- romance, impending death, and explosions-- matters. I've seen people react more strongly when they get the wrong kind of coffee from a Starbucks! >:oThe morality is twisted. From a comic book, one should expect flat, one-dimensional thinking. From Frank Miller, the talented artist but stupid Ayn Rand follower who wrote the comic book on which this film is based, one should expect wildly offensive 'morality' that would make even an idiot say 'wtf, man, rethink this!' The plot and characters will inevitably be compared to America's McCarthyist-style 'war on terrorism', and that just sickens me, because I see the film try to justify a patronizing, lying, violent attitude from government and a billionaire.Everywhere in the film, actors are saying 'This is wrong-headed, illegal, untruthful, patronizing to the citizenry, and an abuse of power... but we're in a dark, scary time so it's OK for now.' Art imitates life, eh! I felt deeply ill.So far this summer, Hancock is the only superhero movie I'd endorse, and that would only get a weak thumbs-up. It's at least funny, and does not try to paint a comic-book morality as 'heroic'.So what SHOULD you see as an action/popcorn movie this summer? I'm wondering if the 'Voyage to the Center of the Earth' film or the new Mummy film, both starring Brendan Frasier, will be a bit better... or at least have a few funny lines. The trailers, though, hint that they'll be campy and unbelievable.",1,70,328,17 July 2008
War of the Worlds," Not deep, but extremely well made
","Ordinarily, location choices and set management are barely considered when a big-budget CGI action flick is made.Happily, this film revels in the opposite extreme: the outer boroughs of New YOrk City, the frumpy clothes, the rain and cold misty breath, the textures and dirt... are all so vivid, so REAL, that we can readily accept something as ..well.. PREPOSTEROUS as an alien invasion.Heck, I even found myself thinking 'Tom Cruise... is acting ? I didn't know he could do that !' The lack of plotting is quite nice, adding to the whole panicked atmosphere of the film rather than detracting.Small touches, like photographing little Rachel (Dakota) through a screen door or showing an alien ship through the maze of bare tree branches, made me really enjoy the textures and realism far more than I have in any other recent movie that comes to mind.If you see this film, you'll enjoy comparing Tom Cruise's frumpy, lumpy, messy house and fractured home life to Will Smith's overly-clean, overly sensational similar home scene in Independence Day. Where Will Smith is asked to play a smarmy, too-clean, all-mighty guy sleeping with a sexy stripper in a fairly well set-decorated house and neighborhood, Tom Cruise is a delight to watch as a divorced, grungy dock-worker whose setting is so believably portrayed as to make me, a New Yorker, nod almost continuously while thinking 'Yeah... that's the way it really is.' More about the acting: Tom Cruise, like WIll Smith, is almost always asked to play a good-looking, all-mighty, smiling near-superhero. It was refreshing in the extreme to see him here with tears, an almost droopy face, and filthy fingernails....a less than average man, surviving only by coincidence, and completely convincing as 'just another guy from the hood'.Dakota's performance as his daughter is even more engrossing. While she isn't yet being offered roles with the impact of Haley Joel Osmet's childhood films, I'm mentally crossing my fingers and hoping that this budding actress will continue to bloom as she has in this film.Tim Robbins' brief role is riveting, and his realism is engrossing. He's truly got star acting power.Little incidental touches, like a woman and her daughter whom TOm Cruise's character sees just before boarding a ferry -- or another character who picks up TOm Cruise's fallen gun, who is nameless and wordless and only on screen for seconds-- are nonetheless producing powerful reactions in the audience.Happily, the script is filled with good lines that are alternately powerfully wise or comical and accidental-seeming bits of real life. Watch for Tom Cruise saying 'Cound you come up with a plan that doesn't involve your 10-year-old sister joining the army ?' or Tim Robbins saying 'It's no more a fight between them and us as there is between men and maggots'.The alien machinery is particularly noteworthy. You'll particularly enjoy its unexpected steam-engine blasts, foghorn sounds, gritty dirty industrial look, and unexpected weakness (it vaporizes people, but leaves clothing intact). The designers succeed brilliantly in delivering an imagined alien technology that is believable, yet entirely unlike anything we've seen before.Walk out before the final scene, though. The Hollywood happy ending is just... too damned silly, and doesn't belong in this film. It's completely unnecessary, ignores the spirit of H.G. Wells' novel, and tears the veil of realism away from this film like someone stripping wallpaper off of bare brick.You'll also be annoyed at the darned silly inclusion of a virtual commercial for the army, toward the end of the film, when a band of army men get to use their bazooka with good results. This is an anti-war movie, but some damned fool on the film's crew decided to turn this and several other scenes into recruiting commercials for the army... completely out of place, like a damned Spice Girls song during a Mozart revival concert.",7,0,1,25 October 2005
The Iron Giant," decent animation, but thoroughly outdated Republican fantasy
","This is a kids' movie that you shouldn't take kids to see.I. It glorifies violence.Ia.The main character is considered 'good', yet he too easily starts shooting at everyone in sight. Ib. Deaths of people are trivialized Ic.The young boy, Hogarth, is armed with a (BB) gun...as is the (sympathetically portrayed) eponymous character.Id. The death-by-hunters'-gunfire for a deer is trivialized with some illogical nonsensical philosophy Ie. Like Brad Bird's other obscenity, 'The Incredibles', the theme is 'might makes right...and good guys are allowed to respond to problems, even little problems, with extreme violence and subjectivity'.II. It pushes religion down your throatIIa. there's a 'saying grace' scene at the dinner table, complete with mentions of a god and Satan. No thanks ! IIb. The robot is told that 'good living things have souls, and souls never die'. *koff-koff*. It should be noted that this weak reasoning is meant to console the robot after he witnesses a deer being shot dead. Must've been one of those eeeeevil, Satan-worshipping soulless deer, huh?In short, this is a hopelessly twisted Republican/Religious-Right morality play, and puts the 'senseless' in 'senseless violence'.I plan to steer clear of this director's future films.",4,8,66,3 December 2006
300," Dazzling blue-screen work, but utterly worthless and unwatchable
","Prepare to run from the theater. It's that mind-bogglingly bad.The racism, homophobia, nationalism, warmongering, fear-mongering, and fascism are both artificial and ballooned into levels that are childishly inappropriate even by Hollywood standards.The constant references by Spartans to their love of 'freedom' (and how it would be replaced with servitude if they bowed down to the Persian king) are laughable, since the plot revolves around a Spartan KING protecting his KINGdom. He is, in fact, the only 'free' person in Sparta; the other 299 warriors must be too hopped up on adrenalin and bravado to have a single political thought while they volunteer to die.(When will sword-and-sandal movie makers give up on trying to tie violent kingdoms together with anachronistic ideas of freedom and fair society? It's like making a pro wrestler put on a dress and serve tea.) The movie portrays all (good) Spartans as physically perfect white folks, all the way down to immaculate hair, perfect teeth, and immaculate clothing. All 'bad' characters have physical defects (for which they are scorned) or are made androgynous/homosexual or Asian or African.Even the math involved is ludicrous and utterly unconsidered by the scriptwriters: the number '300' is used again and again, though the size of the '300' falls and expands repeatedly. The sun is blotted out by arrows shot at the Spartans, yet nobody (apparently) considered or cared how impossible it would have been to fire that many arrows. (And the number of arrows that land is barely a handful.) The number of soldiers from Sparta is supposedly '300', yet we never see more than 20 to 40.The logistics are as empty-headed as every other part of the film: soldiers travel endlessly without food or foot sores or bedding. Swords never break or dull. Flies never buzz around corpses.In short, this is a nightmarishly childish, moronic piece of filth with no excuse and no redeeming qualities. Nobody could like this film, except perhaps a violent, heavily medicated, muddle-headed, neo-Nazi 5-year-old boy who doesn't know what 'freedom' means yet.If this film has any positive value, it might be as a cautionary tale: an example of conservative, militaristic madness (like 'reefer madness') that hyperbolizes the worst parts of the culture that produces it. While trying to stir up patriotism and pro-military sentiment, this film merely turns those concepts into (rightfully) laughable yet nauseating material.",1,12,30,4 June 2007
