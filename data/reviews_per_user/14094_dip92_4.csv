Many of Spielbergs greatest achievements is often casting the right role for the actors/actresses, this movie follows this path yet again! Ben Mendelsohn role was perfect along with Tye and Mark. Mark Rylance now seems to be Spielbergs go to man for his movies recently and this comes to no surprise.The visual effects created were the highlight of this movie and the creative mind of Spielberg continues to surprise and impress me.Spielberg was ready to play and hit this movie out of the park!",8,1,3,12 September 2019
Joker," Excellent performance! Oscar worthy!!
","The performance of Phoenix's was astonishing, he nails both characters of the Joker and as Arthur.The amount of time and focus both during the movie production and prior can clearly be seen in Phoenix's performance. This is definitely one of Phoenix's best performances and is highly worth of an Oscar nomination!Todd's directing highly deserves his share of the praise for this movie! The make-up and costume design was too excellent.",9,11,30,13 September 2019
