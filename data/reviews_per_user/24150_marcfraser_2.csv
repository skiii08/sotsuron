It," Horror? Lol
","Gonna own up straight away, I've watched half of this on Blu Ray, and have no desire to watch the second half anytime soon. It certainly isn't because I'm too scated, me and my partner (who scared quite easilly) laughed through what we watched. It was absolutely pathetic and did not deserve any of the hype it was getting around its release date. The acting is fine, but it just isn't what it's trying to be......",3,2,4,30 April 2018
Apocalypse Now," W...what?
","I don't write many reviews, but after watching this so called 'masterpiece' or 'classic' last night for the first time i feel it warrants it, i need to warn people like myself about it. STAY AWAY!, it's 3 hours of your life you'll never get back. I like Martin Sheen, Brando, Larry Fishbourne, Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper....heck i like all the cast. Francis Ford Coppola is a legendary director. I like war films. What i don't like....is Apocalypse Now. It drags on and on....and on, and then the ending is a complete anti-climax. Robert Duvall's surfing obsessed Lt. Colonel is the best part about this film, he's a breathe of fresh air in an otherwise over rated movie....",4,8,16,11 August 2015
