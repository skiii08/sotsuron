Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049
","Thoroughly satisfying film, and succeeds at what it meant to be - a visually striking and though provoking sequel to legendary science-fiction epic. I guess, at the moment, there aren't anyone who doesn't expect visual extravaganza with coherent story telling from Denis Velleneuve. 'Blade Runner 2049' doesn't disappoint in that department. The story is well developed, and every detail is at its right place with an intention to move the story forward and not just for the show. Not everything is overly elaborated and some stuff is given with only subtle glimpses and hunches which only purpose seems to make the movie seem more pretentious and deeper than it actually is (not that is a bad thing), but behind the sleek visuals, well written story and cool characters, there aren't much to rattle your brains about that hasn't been said before hundred times (including the first 'Blade Runner'). But that's not the most important anyway, as I didn't expect to see some great deep message, but rather well written science-fiction film, and that I got plenty of. Although the film is quite slow burning, the overall pacing is done so well that the running time feels much less than 160 minutes. Oh yes, and one can't forget that ominous technoir music by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer.New 'Blade Runner' can be seen as a stand alone film, and it is very good continuation to the first. This is the second time when Ridley Scott's movie gets sequel that is on a quite equal level with the first one, so lets hope they don't intend to make more, because we all remember what happened to the previous franchise R. Scott started.Well written, well acted and masterfully directed science-fiction move that treats your mind and eyes. It might never become as legendary as its predecessor, but definitely one of the finest pieces of the genre in recent years.",8,2,8,24 October 2017
