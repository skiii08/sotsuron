Casablanca," Hollywood at its absolute best
","I just watched Casablanca last night, and it's one of the greatest films I have ever seen in my life. Everything about it is great. For one, it is one of the most gripping love stories ever to hit the screens, and its romantic drama has rarely been matched since it was made. Same goes for the acting, which is some of the finest in film history. All of this and more will put together one of the greatest movies you will ever see. Period.Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is an ex-freedom fighter who now runs a nightclub in Casablanca, a place filled entirely with French refugees seeking unauthorized transit passes so they can escape to America. Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is at the top of the Nazi most wanted list, comes to Casablanca with his wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), a former lover of Blaine who departed him when the Nazis overtook Paris. She wants her husband to escape, but her love for Rick re-ignites, and she wants to stay in Casablanca. However, things become more dangerous for the Laszlos, and despite their revived love for each other, Rick convinces Ilsa that she must leave with her husband. He then sees her off on a plane on a fog-enshrouded runway in one of the greatest movie conclusions of all time.
There are so many moments, many of which will forever be unforgotten, in Casablanca that stand out even when compared to greater or bigger films. Every scene is gripping, like when Rick has a flashback to his romantic times with Ilsa in Paris while piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson) plays 'As Time Goes By', or when Rick walks out onto the runway and tells Capt. Renault (Claude Rains), 'Louis, I think this could be the start of a beautiful friendship'. But these invincible moments obviously don't need retelling, for almost everyone knows of them. As for the timeless cast, Humphrey Bogart is simply stunning as the leading man. The class, drama, and brilliance in his performance are impossible to match, although there have been countless attempts to try to surpass it. Ingrid Bergman is simply gorgeous, and contributes a performance that's worth cheering for. In fact, all of the performances in this movie will have you cheering.
This is the kind of film that many other Hollywood movies have followed the footsteps of, yet probably very few have rivaled or suprassed. In a nutshell, Casablanca is a sweeping classic that will leave you breathless. From Humphrey Bogart's classy acting to the great ending, there is not a flaw to speak of. In the battle of the ultimate classics, it's not as good as Citizen Kane (despite a higher star rating, but star ratings don't speak all of the volumes in my book). But it's still a fantastic movie. Watch it and enjoy it. `Here's looking at you kid!'***** out of *****",Null,1,1,8 February 2003
Citizen Kane," An unforgettable classic
","Just a couple of nights ago I had the privilege of watching Citizen Kane, and although this may be a movie that isn't recommended for teens, I absolutely loved it. The classic masterpiece that launched Orson Welles into the film industry is easily one of the greatest films of all time.Citizen Kane has an intriguing beginning. Welles easily captures you with the scenes of Kane's province, first showing a 'No Trespassing' sign that instantly let me know I was watching a great movie. The camera moves up to Charles Kane on his death bed, where he mutters the unforgettable word 'Rosebud' and then drops his snow globe. When the News On The March part began I was charmed, and it was very creative. I'll admit I was fooled a bit, thinking that the whole film was going to be a news show. But instead it develops into a plot that revolves around a journalist searching for what Kane meant by Rosebud. The film shows Kane's life from the day he was adopted by a rich man named Mr. Thatcher and continues on through the many interesting debacles and triumphs that surrounded him for the rest of his days. What can I say? The film is incredible. It has many great characters and plenty of interesting aspects that make you glad you're watching it. It moves you during every second. I was amazed by the many great scenes and moments, such as Kane's speech during his run for governor, Kane watching his wife sing at the opera in disbelief, and his tantrum when he threw objects across the room after the departure of his second wife and then discovered his snow globe, which made him realize that he longed for the simple days of his childhood. Very few movies have been able to recapture the magic of Citizen Kane. I may not agree with most people on the statement that it's THE greatest movie of all time, but I love it anyway and it's one of my favorites.

Ed Wood," Delightful and hilarious comedy
","After being entertained by Plan 9 From Outer Space, I was pretty excited to check this out. I found the copy we own and put it in the tape player. I can say only one thing: I absolutely love this movie!!!!! I had so much fun watching it. I even clapped when it was over! Tim Burton's charming, witty, and flawless comedy is a major contender for the most unique movie of all time. Other than that it's entertaining from beginning to end. Johnny Depp captures the hilarity and ineptitude of Edward D. Wood Jr., a name synonymous with many people and one of the first thoughts that will come to mind when the term 'bad movie' is brought up. Depp will crack you up as he takes you through the many ups and not too distant downs of Wood's career. Watching this movie has left me under the impression that Depp is a fabulous actor (which I'm sure he is), and I really want to check out more of his movies. In fact, Depp's portrayal was so great, it's one of the best performances I have ever seen. The movie begins with Wood attending his own play at an old shack on a rainy night, and the audience members are either asleep or talking with one another. Despite being slated in the papers, Wood still focuses on the rare positive comments such as `The soldiers' clothes looked realistic' rather than face the fact that his production stunk. Later that night, Wood tells his wife about his worries of making it in Hollywood, and she assures him that things will get better. After being rejected for the directing job of `I Changed My Sex', Wood meets Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), who is now old, washed up, and out of a job. Plus, very few people know he's still alive. But Wood is thrilled and wants to cast him in a movie. Ed convinces the creator of `I Changed My Sex' to let him direct it and gets the job. He writes the script, changing the title to `Glen or Glenda'. It is after his wife's reading of the script that she finds Wood in female clothing, revealing his passion for wearing it. `Glen or Glenda' proves to be so bad that it only premieres in Alabama, Missouri, and Indiana. He later slews together several misfits such as wrestler Tor Johnson (George Steele), future-predicting Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), and Lugosi for his next movie called `Bride of The Atom', which is renamed `Bride of The Monster'. Despite being kicked out of the perfect studio for not paying, he still goes on without any doubt. He gets the owner of a meat butchering company to pay for the film after two unsuccessful donation parties. And for the exciting climax, he has Bela Lugosi fight a giant rubber octopus. At the premiere, the cast is pelted with concessions and garbage, and they make it out just in time to catch a taxi, missing the entire movie. Later on, Ed learns that Lugosi, who had admitted earlier that he was addicted to drugs, has just died. He is heartbroken, and as a tribute, his movie, `Grave Robbers From Outer Space', is billed as the final film of Bela Lugosi. Since Wood is in a tight spot financially, he seals a deal with his apartment landlord to help him make the film. His associates provide ideas that he doesn't like, making him disgruntled. But when he gets an inspirational speech from his lifelong hero Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio), he is once again motivated to finish the movie, renamed `Plan 9 From Outer Space'. After finishing the film, Wood claims that it will be the film that they remember him by. And he receives a standing ovation at the premiere. This is a one-of-a-kind film. What's so funny about the ending is that it takes the common `character gets discouraged, character gets inspirational speech and advice, character gets back in and wins' element and adds a funny and different kind of twist to it. The same can be said about the story in general, which tells the story of one of the worst directors of all time rather than show you the times of a successful figure. It's hard to pick the best scene, but I especially loved when the three men were previewing Glen or Glenda (`Pull the string! Pull the string!'). I also liked the scene where the guy couldn't tell the difference between the red and green dresses that Loretta King had to pick since he was colorblind, which is funny since the entire film is in black and white. The performances of Wood's common associates and cast members are inspiring and fun to watch, and I also have to give plenty of credit to Juliet Landau for being really hot. All of the famous moments of his career are captured perfectly, and there's even a touching subplot that shows how much Wood loved Lugosi. Landau definitely deserved the Academy Award he received, for he too does a great job playing his part. He even delivered some of the movie's best lines. Bill Murray also has a fun to watch performance during the show. 	 Even if you're not into Ed Wood's movies or his career, you'll still be greatly entertained by Burton's out-of-this-world movie. A big recommendation, especially if you need a different kind of movie to crack you up. So sit back and enjoy, because you won't see another movie like this for a long, long time. ***** out of *****",10,0,0,31 January 2003
L.A. Confidential," A truly classic thriller
","L.A. Confidential is, without one single doubt, one of the greatest movies. Ever. If I should start this review with its flaws, I can't say anything. This movie is perfect.The film is mainly about three cops working for the corrupt L.A. police force in the 1950's. The cops are Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), who books movie stars so the newspaper 'Hush Hush' can cook up some juicy headlines about it, Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), a fresh new cop who's trying to live up to his father's high ranks, and Bud White (Russell Crowe), a tough officer who will go to any means to get the job done. When three patrons are slain at a coffee shop, these three men are sent in to investigate, and many different clues and people are unraveled. Even when a prime suspect is arrested, it still doesn't prove to be the final key in the mystery, for there are many people who play important roles in the case. After all, nothing is what it seems. This film is loaded with surprising and awesome scenes that will definitely catch you off guard. I recommend that you strap yourself to your chair, because this movie will sweep you right off your feet. It's loaded with fantastic gun duels and suspenseful moments. The cast is also perfect. I was totally swept away by the performances of Pearce, Crowe, and Spacey. Every scene is grabbing, and each one speaks massive volumes of the scenarios. There are hardly any films that are as well directed and filmed as L.A. Confidential. I could go on and on with positive comments for god's sake. I just recently checked the book out of the library as well. There is only one word that can summarize this movie: Classic.In short, this is a movie that will wow anybody. I recommend it for anyone, but if you're a fan of complex and intriguing mysteries with many layers, you'll absolutely love this for sure. If you haven't seen it, just buy it already.My rating: **** out of *****",Null,0,1,18 January 2003
Taxi Driver," Chilling and dark classic from Scorsese
","(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD)Despite some disturbing elements, Taxi Driver, one of many acclaimed films from the legendary Martin Scorsese, is a real winner. Scorsese does an incredible job illustrating the bad side of New York, a place full of dopes, pimps, and hookers. It is a place where war veteran Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) works everyday, always observing the rough activity that goes on as he escorts several people, some of which are mentally ill and crazy. Travis longs deeply for someone to come and eliminate the foul events that occur in the street. He is a shaky person who is hardly in touch with anything that goes on in the world, and he spends his time attending porn movies and writing in his diary, always describing life as it goes on and sometimes changes. Despite his image and his slight mental problems, Bickle is actually a very truthful person who often knows what is right and what's wrong. Bickle spends most of his time watching campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and convinces her to go out with him. His liking for her causes him to take interest in the same things that she likes, and things go well for him. But Travis angers Betsy after he takes her to an XXX movie, and she falls out of touch. This and a few encounters with teenage prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster) make Bickle want to take action. He purchases a set of guns and makes up many interesting ways of drawing them out, such as a track on his arm that will make the gun slide into firing position when his arm is cocked. His first step towards redemption is the murder of a man who holds a convenience store clerk at gunpoint. Bit by bit, he gets darker in personality. He attempts to murder presidential candidate Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), whom he told he supported only because he wanted to become friends with Betsy. But he realizes that Palantine is not a worthy candidate, and is only stopped by a bodyguard whom he had spent time shooting the breeze with beforehand. He later meets pimp `Sport' Matthew (Harvey Keitel), who uses Iris and her friend as hookers. Travis arranges to have sex with Iris, but only to convince her that she is leading the wrong kind of life. After much persuasion, Iris and her friend begin to follow his lead. Bickle later shoots Matthew and the other people who control Iris, and she returns to her parents. He is seriously hurt, but he recovers and continues his job. Travis is hailed and praised by many newspapers and people, but he takes it in stride and returns to the regular life of hanging out with his taxi driving pals and cruising the streets, just like always.Taxi Driver, put shortly, is one of the greatest films of our time. I loved the dark aspects of the film that Martin Scorsese put in, and the story is inspiring. Robert De Niro delivers a remarkable portrayal of the classic Travis Bickle, a truly one-of-a-kind character. This movie will make you cringe a lot, but that doesn't derail the film's greatness. It has the ever-famous dialogue (`You talkin' to me? You, talkin' to me?') that millions upon millions of people have repeated, ridiculed, and adored. The whole film is brilliantly put together, and I recommend it. However, there are some rather disturbing scenes, and the violence was a little over the top and gross. Anyone who is sensitive to violence or strong sexual scenes probably shouldn't check this out. But truthfully, those two elements are the only things that kept this film from getting a perfect score from me.

Full Metal Jacket," Savage and merciless war movie
","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is a brutal, unmerciful, and fantastic film that harshly depicts the everyday life of boot camp patrons, who later battle in the Vietnam War. Kubrick paints a dark and moving picture of life in boot camp, and just what it's like to live the intense life of a Vietnam soldier. Everything is incredibly done: The casting, the action, the drama, and the realism. But if there's one thing that makes Full Metal Jacket a great film, it's the intensity. This is the kind of film that makes you stop breathing a bunch of times, anxiously waiting to see what will happen. This is so mainly because of the large absence of music, bringing more heart stopping twists and surprises to thrill viewers. Put shortly, this has to be, without one single little doubt, one of the greatest films (war or regular) of all time.SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Full Metal Jacket's plot revolves around boot camp patrons such as J.T. `Joker' Davis (Matthew Modine), Leonard `Gomer Pyle' Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), and Private Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard) as they go through the living hell of boot camp, led by the fiery Sgt. Hartman (real-life boot camp instructor R. Lee Ermey). Hartman spares no mercy for any of the recruits, but he mostly takes his ferocity and vulgar out on Lawrence because of his struggles and his weight. Things keep getting worse for him, and he gets into more and more trouble with Hartman. However, with the help of Joker, Gomer improves his skills and earns more respect from their explosive trainer. But after all of the recruits have graduated and have been assigned, Joker finds Gomer sitting in the bathroom loading a rifle magazine late at night, even though they're not allowed in there. He has become darker in personality during the training course, and when Hartman comes in and orders Lawrence to drop the rifle, he shoots him and himself.
After boot camp, the movie then focuses on Joker as he starts his tenure in the Vietnam War as a reporter. Joker is sent with other troops such as `Animal Mother' (Adam Baldwin) and Pvt. Eightball (Dorian Harewood) on brutal and heart-pounding missions in Vietnam, including one where he and a small band of troops seek a dangerous sniper amidst a bombed and rubble-laden city. It's scenes like these that leave a lasting impression on you, and when the movie ends you'll be thinking, `Wow. That just blew my mind.' The hilarious and scathing dialogue is some of the best you'll ever hear when it comes to movies.  For example (please excuse some of the language):Hartman: `How tall are you private?' Private Cowboy: `Sir, five-foot-nine, sir!' Hartman: `Five-foot-nine? I didn't know they stacked s*** that high.'Hartman: `Were you born worthless, or did you have to work at it?'Joker: `Leonard, if Hartman finds us here we'll be in a world of s***.'Gomer: `I am in a world of s***.'Hartman: `What's your name fat-body?' Gomer: `Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir!' Hartman: `Lawrence? Lawrence what? Of Arabia?'
What more is there to say? Why, Stanley Kubrick deserved every shred of appraisal he received for this incredible masterpiece. Like in most of his films, there are no clichés, predictable outcomes, or likely story lines. It's a different kind of war movie, and it shines like a thousand diamonds. It just has to be seen to be believed. Hopefully by now I have implied a sense that this film kicks butt. Even though Apocalypse Now is currently the best war movie in my book, this still has to be considered a contender for that title. So go ahead and give it a whirl. You won't be disappointed one bit. **** out of *****",Null,0,0,14 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A masterpiece and one of the greatest movies of all time
","This movie is sheer brilliance. I can't believe I didn't watch it until just recently! The Fellowship of The Ring packs an incredible wallop with superb settings and designs, exciting battles, and a 5 star cast. Famous actors Ian Mckellen and Christopher Lee (One of my favorite actors) contribute timeless performances, and the rest of the cast leaves me speechless. Elijah Wood plays the main role of Frodo Baggins spectacularly, Sean Bean is cool, Viggo Mortensen is thrilling, and what can I say about Orlando Bloom? I LOVED HIS CHARACTER(Legolas Greenleaf)!!!! I also really like the guy with the big beard and the axe. Wasn't that John Rhys-Davies? Anyways, this movie also moves well with its imaginative plot, courtesy of J.R.R. Tolkien. The Lord of The Rings will never let you escape for a second, with amazing battle scenes that feature a meagre number of battlers take out an entire army of trolls and baddies in outstanding fashion. There's also the captivating visual effects to grab you. As yet another plus, Peter Jackson perfectly illustrates Tolkien's story on the screen. So, yep. This movie is one of the greatest films of all time and is one of my most highly recommended favorites. It also gives me three important things to do: 1, read the book. 2, see The Two Towers. And 3, get this on DVD! My rating: 4.5 out of 5.",10,1,1,21 December 2002
Apocalypse Now," Mind blowing
","What words can describe the sheer perfection of Apocalypse Now? Here are a few for starters: Awesome, sweeping, powerful, exciting, and incredibly mind blowing. Francis Ford Coppola's illustration of mankind's dark side is perhaps the best war film ever made. It's also one of the best films I have ever viewed during my existence. It succeeds on every level possible. This film will meet all of your expectations no matter what, and it doesn't fail on a single level. If Apocalypse Now isn't an example of cinematic perfection, then I don't know what is.SPOILER WARNINGCapt. Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen), a soldier who is growing increasingly tired of his inner city surroundings in Saigon and wants to return to the Vietnamese jungles, is assigned on a mission to track down and kill renegade Colonel Walter Kurtz, a madman assassin who is rumored to have set up a hideaway in the Cambodian jungle. Willard and associates Tyrone Miller (Laurence Fishburne), Lance B. Johnson (Sam Bottoms), Jay 'Chef' Hicks (Frederic Forrest), and Quartermaster Phillips (Albert Hall) journey down the jungle river in a small boat. Along the way they encounter many strange things and people, such as  helicopter flight leader Lt. Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall), a boisterous, overly confident, and surf loving commander who heads a visually stunning aerial attack on a Vietnamese town while Richard Wagner's `Ride of the Valkyries' roars out from his helicopter.
As the journey through the jungle continues, Willard's assignment grates his nerves more and more, slowly causing him to become like the lunatic he has been assigned to kill. With each passing day, the crew sees wreckage and dead bodies left in the wake of Kurtz, and the tension becomes insurmountable. After several crazy events, such as a Playboy performance turned into a riot by overexcited soldiers, an accidental murder of an innocent family, and the loss of two crewmembers, the small boat makes it to Kurtz's outpost, where dead bodies hang everywhere, and the words `Apocalypse Now' are inscribed on the walls. At long last, Willard is taken to see Kurtz, who already suspects that he has arrived to kill him. Kurtz believes that Willard has the right to kill him, but that he has no right to judge him just because of his wicked personality. He then sits in silence as Kurtz reveals his tales and thoughts of the war and what caused him to go mad. During his stay, a crazed photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) also tells Willard of his target's insanity and the admiration he has received from all of his `children', and the pressure builds on him constantly. Then, one night, as the local villagers hack an ox to death during a ceremony, Willard brings Kurtz to his knees. As he walks out of the temple, the villagers all bow to him and worship him as their new leader. They then stare as he and Johnson slowly float down the river as the final words of Colonel Kurtz echo. `The horror. The horror.'Now, I have seen a lot of great war movies. But so far this has got to be my favorite for many reasons. The first one is the visuals, which could be the best in motion picture history. Even today, with most movies relying on computer graphics, they don't look the least bit dated. The amazing technical prowess of this film is first examplified in the beginning, which has the camera resting on a shot of a palm tree forest as the low `bum, bum, bum' of passing helicopters echoes. Then the forest erupts into a napalm explosion of flames and smoke as The Doors' `The End' starts playing. After that, there are hardly any climaxes that aren't visually breathtaking. The best of these scenes is easily the aerial attack. How could you not be swept away by such a perfectly filmed climax? Wagner's roaring symphony more than perfectly aids the thrill of the attack, and it will please your ears while the awesome camerawork provides a treat for your eyes. Just the sight of the air cavalry dotting the sky as the camera moves slowly back is enough to blow you away. If you were spellbound by the cinematography of Lawrence of Arabia, then you will love this. Apocalypse Now also does a great job of mixing cold and morbid humor with the illustrations of the darkness of war. Robert Duvall, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his blisteringly brilliant role as Kilgore, is simply outrageous. I loved the scene where a bunch of villagers try to escape on a truck, which Kilgore sees and says, `Don't these people ever give up?' He then launches a missile, blowing the truck up and catapulting the riders into the river beneath the bridge they were driving across. It's scenes like this and the part when troops surf the waves while the water is bombed that will bring at least a snigger out of you no matter how morbid they are. The whole surfing thing was just hilarious too (`Charlie don't surf!').Among all of the great elements that make Apocalypse Now perfect, I think the one thing that really stood out was the darkness. Showing the insanity and the downside of war separates this from others, and the gritty images of hell that this film portrays are in-depth. Plus, they perfectly mix together with the deep plot. Like it or not, you have to give credit to Coppola for the grittiness that he put into this movie.Well, that was quite a mouthful. But before I catch my breath, let me also state that this is one of the best movies that your eyeballs will have the pleasure to absorb. I can guarantee that you will love it with all your heart and more. What Coppola put into this work of art is something that you will never see in a movie again. It's so great, that there isn't a single word that can sum it up. So If you're looking for a great film that illustrates the cruelty of war, then this should be first on your list. It's got great actors (including a young Laurence Fishburne), wild humor, gripping action, and a strong and gritty story. A recommendation for all.

The Fast and the Furious," Extremely laughable surge of hormones
","Now, I have a question: Why did people even bother to see this movie? Come on, this is so bad it makes the first Rugrats Movie and Lilo and Stitch look like Lord of the Rings and The Spy Who Loved Me. I know I'm not the type for this kind of movie, but that's not going to let it off the hook. This film is loaded with despicable one-liners and a horrible soundtrack. I don't even know the plot. It's just about a bunch of racers in L.A., and one of them is an undercover cop who's looking for a bunch of hijackers or something like that. It's nothing to take you away. Oh, and starting the movie with two guys arguing about a tuna sandwich? Ooh, that's genius.
Even if that wasn't enough, the cast sucks, plain and simple. Rick Yune delivered a very good performance, but the performances of Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, and Vin Diesel (Blech) are pretty bad. This film is nothing but a bunch of street homies showing off their sports cars to impress a bunch of stupid girls. In fact, the title of this movie should be something like 'Raging Hormones'. There are its good points though. The effects of day changing to night are cool, the settings of L.A. for the first 20 minutes or so are pretty good, and the race scene is captivating. But most of the other action is pretty lame. There is some stuff to grab you, but nothing to entertain you. I can't believe I stayed up until midnight watching this when I could have been doing something more fun, like dusting mothballs off my clothes or washing dishes. I think I'd rather watch a movie called 'The Telemarketer' than go through the living heck of watching this monstrosity again. Please spend your time watching a real movie like Star Wars, the James Bond movies, or Lord of the Rings. I think the only believable reason anyone would watch this would be to laugh at how bad it is. My rating for this: 2 out of 5.",3,1,4,22 December 2002
Lawrence of Arabia," Dazzling
","Lawrence Of Arabia, the amazing treasure from director David Lean, is dazzling. It's an exciting, mind blowing, thought capturing movie of epic proportions. It took me two days to watch it, but I was still thrilled all the way through. Everything was perfect: The action, the acting, the cast, the scenes, and the score. Based on a true story, the film tells the tale of British soldier T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), who is sent to Arabia by his disgruntled general to help the Arabians in their revolt against Turkey during World War one. He joins the group of Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) and leads fifty of his men across the desert to a faraway city. On the way, when they reach the end of a barren strip with no water, Lawrence realizes that one person has been left behind. Sherif Ali Ibn El Kharish (Omar Sherif) criticizes Lawrence's decision, telling him that he will die trying. Lawrence ends up saving the man's life and earns momentous respect from his fellow travelers. His name also becomes of great honor. He eventually conjoins his group with another that is led by Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) and their success becomes even greater as they conquer more territory and defeat armies of Turks. But a brutal beating in the office of a Turkish Bey (Jose Ferrer) makes him realize that his place is with his own people. In the end, he must decide whether his loyalties are with the Arabs or the British. I can guarantee that you will be stunned by this film. There are amazing and grabbing moments from start to finish. Arabia may not be a scenic land, but the settings and filming locations are just beautiful. Lean will capture you with sweeping shots of the barren land that Lawrence must cross, although some of them go on a little too long. The movie has an extremely lengthy running time, so it will definitely need your full attention. But that does allow for some pretty exciting action. I give every performance contributed two big thumbs up, like those of Omar Sherif, Anthony Quinn, and Alec Guinness, who would later go on to play the famous Obi Wan Kenobi. Peter O'Toole captures the magic of the story with a perfect portrayal of T.E. Lawrence as well. Plus, the two young servant kids reminded me of Merry and Pippin from the Lord Of The Rings films. There are some rather sad moments, and the ending was a little disappointing. However, those don't take away the magic of this classic. I recommend it to everybody!**** out of *****",Null,0,1,25 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Best movie ever?
","I was in a bit of an unhappy mood when my father and his brothers took my sister and I to go see this. By the time I left the theater my mind was completely devoid of any unhappy thoughts. This was more than just a good movie: It could be the greatest film ever. Now a lot of people are going to disagree with that, but I don't care. This is even better than the first, and considering the fact that the first one is one of the greatest movies of all time, you know that you have a classic right here.Rather than starting with flashback scenes like in the first, The Two Towers starts with Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) having a dream about Gandalf's death during the Fellowship journey. Gandalf's battle with the fire monster while plummeting down into a deep cavern is the perfect climax to start the movie, and it's definitely the right way to pick up where Fellowship left off. But overall, TTT didn't start too well for me. It's great all the way through, but I thought it was overly violent and scary at first, two factors that made me think, 'There's no way this is going to be better than the first one.' The film does, however, get better and better from there on. There are many exciting twists and scenes that will surprise and excite you. The battle in Rohan (Or wherever it was: The place where everyone fled to and hid in the caves) was one of the most riveting cinematic moments I have ever experienced in my entire life. Like the brilliant Star Wars Episode 1, the ending switches between sequences like the tree invasion of Saruman's kingdom, and they're so good that even if you're on the brink of wetting your pants after that huge drink you had, you'll still remain planted in your seat just to see what happens. The scenes in this movie were so tense that I could feel my pulse racing, and when Gimli (John Rhys-Davis), my favorite character, jumped into the storm of invaders, I think I could have passed out. If what I just said isn't enough to convince you that this is one of the greatest films of all time, then I don't know what to say. This movie has everything and beyond. And if you thought Ian Mckellen was great in the first, wait until he drops your jaw this time. All in all this film is perfect except for Smeagle, who, although proves to be an interesting character, gets pretty annoying and says the word precious too many times. But I'd much rather listen to him all day instead of Moaning Myrtle, the top candidate for most annoying movie character ever. My rating: 5 out of 5",10,0,1,4 January 2003
Reservoir Dogs," Interesting and exciting movie
","Reservoir Dogs left me a little disappointed when I watched it for the first time. But ever since then I've thought about it a little more, and now I would have to say that it's probably as good as everyone says it is. Quentin Tarantino did a wonderful job with this truly unique movie, which will keep viewers on the edge of their seats with thrills, surprises, and tense scenes. These and a great cast make it one of the greatest gangster movies of all time. Four criminals are assembled to pull off the perfect crime: A huge robbery of a jewelry store. But their heist turns into an ambush when the cops unexpectedly arrive sooner than they thought. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) escapes with a severely injured Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) gets away from the cops in a stolen car. Wisecracking Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), who recently got out of jail, went nuts during the robbery. Mr. White becomes suspicious of him, and accuses him of being the police informer he believes is in the group. Blonde, however, captured a cop as proof that he isn't the police informer. But who is? The twist filled plot unravels into a story that shows how the Reservoir Dogs came to be, and all of the flashbacks lead up to the disrupted robbery. Reservoir Dogs is a film that is filled to the rafters with great suspense and strong yet funny humor. Tarantino puts you right in the middle of it all with the flashback sequences, like when Mr. Orange tells Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney), `Nice Guy' Eddie Cabot (Chris Penn) and Mr. Blonde the story of when he walked into a bathroom filled with cops with a suitcase full of marijuana in his hands. I loved the film's beginning with the Dogs in the coffee shop, and of course, the ever-famous walking scene. The movie carries a lot of power and action that's perfectly done, allowing for some very memorable scenes. However, Tarantino also loads it with tons of violence and profanity, putting the F word in almost every sentence spoken. I was just praying that there would be a 10-second span with no cussing. But I guess that's just Quentin Tarantino, and the violence and profanity don't take the fun out of the ride (Although those elements would overshadow some of the good elements in Pulp Fiction). All in all, Reservoir Dogs is a cool movie with fun thrills, cool scenes, and memorable performances. Be sure to watch it if you haven't checked it out yet. *** and a half out of *****",Null,0,1,10 February 2003
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A touching masterpiece
","One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, based on the best selling novel by the late Ken Kesey, is perhaps the greatest emotional ride in the history of movies. Jack Nicholson plays Randle P. McMurphy, a convicted criminal who pretends to be mentally ill. He is sent to a mental hospital, and he fits in well. McMurphy observes the sometimes degrading life at the asylum and does outrageous things to try and make the patients realize that there's so much more to life than what the nurses tell them. Nurse Ratched (Louise Flethcer) becomes annoyed by McMurphy's behavior, and tries to stick to her own plans for the patients rather than allow his activities. Randle makes many touching outreaches to the patients, such as the quiet Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), who is taught how to raise his arms into the air and put a basketball in the net. These scenes are some of the greatest in film history. I just loved the part where McMurphy gets a 10 out of 18 vote to watch the World Series, yet Ratched rejects it because the meeting held during the voting was over. But he fills the void by shouting out commentary and exciting the others. The 'He hits a f****** home run!' line cracked me up. The moments in this movie are moving and hilarious, like when Randle takes the boys out for a fishing trip and when he hides his medication in his mouth and spits it at one of the patients. Overall this movie is actually as much of a comedy as it is a drama movie. And the drama is very powerful as well. The ending is sad, but it is fantastic.To support the classic moments, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest has a wonderful cast that features Danny Devito, the entertaining Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif, who recently appeared in Lord Of The Rings and The Two Towers. Jack Nicholson himself provides one of the greatest performances ever. This flick is a true delight to anyone who watches. I can guarantee it.**** and a half out of *****",Null,0,1,19 January 2003
Platoon," Gritty and tense
","Most films about the Vietnam War deliver a powerful message. Apocalypse Now shows how war can drive a man to insanity and darkness, Full Metal Jacket focuses on dehumanization and turning wimps into killing machines, and The Deer Hunter tells the story of a simple friendship swept away by the tide of war. Then there's Platoon, which shows how allies can start a war amongst them and become bigger dangers to one another than their real enemies. It also shows how the fight for leadership can tear into the ones who fight for it. But this conflict affects the soldiers most of all, and they must decide whether their loyalties are with the bitter, tough-as-nails leader (Tom Berenger), or the more faithful and supportive one (William Dafoe).
SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE!!!Platoon's gripping and unmerciful story is told by soldier Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), a college dropout who put his education behind just to become a soldier. He is assigned to a platoon of mixed personalities and races such as Big Harold (Forest Whitaker), Rhah (Francesco Quinn), and Sgt. O'Neill (John McGinley). The soldiers must deal with the brutality and sickening reality of war: Rotting corpses, red ants biting your neck, swarms of gnats and mosquitoes that leave swollen bites all over your face, booby-trapped bunkers, and Viet Cong platooning by night. But the biggest threat to the well being of the band is the battle for its command.
The platoon's leadership is split between scar-faced Sgt. Barnes (Berenger) and Sgt. Elias (Dafoe). Sgt. Barnes is a hateful and ungracious troop who kills with a vengeance. Elias is a man who has lost faith in the war, but still cares for his fellow soldiers. At first the two are able to cooperate, but when they are faced with a threat or are caught in a tight situation their decisions are almost exactly different. If a man were wounded, Barnes would rather leave his body to rot rather than tend to him, whereas Elias calls in for medical attention immediately. When the platoon invades a Vietnamese village, Barnes will shoot anybody who dares to try and stop him and even threatens to kill a child, but Elias would rather save the civilians and do what must be done. The conflict between the two eventually reaches boiling point, and when Elias stumbles upon Barnes during a Vietnamese troop invasion, his ungrateful rival shoots him. Taylor, whose loyalty had been with Elias during his gruesome stay, starts to believe that Barnes shot Elias when he sees the wounded and helpless sergeant praying for mercy while being hunted down by Viet Cong troops. When they meet back at base later on, Chris jumps right to conclusions with Barnes and attempts to kill him. He fails, however, and Barnes isn't daunted.
The next day, the platoon heads out to the jungle once more to battle the Vietnamese troops. The Viet Cong strike late at night, attacking the American bunkers and outposts with full force. As bullets ricochet everywhere and explosions and fires erupt, a scrambling Taylor runs into Barnes, who has gone insane and is repeatedly stabbing a Viet Cong troop to death. Taylor pulls Barnes back, who pins him down and holds his knife high above him, ready to stab him to death. As Chris screams, a jet flies overhead and launches bombs, sending the forest up in a fiery napalm explosion and wiping nearly everything out. When Taylor wakes up the next morning, he finds a severely injured Barnes crawling across the ground in search of medical aid. When he turns around to find Taylor pointing a rifle at him, he says, `Go ahead. Shoot me.' In two seconds he's lying on the ground with bullets in his chest. Then, all of a sudden, a search team arrives to rescue Taylor and bring him back to the helicopter landing field. He is then carried aboard one on a stretcher, his time in Vietnam finished. But as the chopper sails over the smoking and body-ridden battlefield, Taylor begins to cry, realizing that the biggest enemy of all proved to be themselves.Shortly put, this is one of the best films ever made. One of the many things that helps it achieve its status of greatness is the message it delivers. It basically shows how war can wreck the lives of those sucked in, and although there aren't any metaphorical aspects to it or such, it's still a powerful message that is perfectly exemplified by Oliver Stone. You can clearly see it right at the beginning when leaving troops shoot a cold glance towards Chris and the other newcomers. And from there on it becomes stronger and stronger.But perhaps the best thing about the entire movie is the tension that constantly builds during each climax. The way Stone makes the Viet Cong appear as camouflaged silhouettes is eerie, presenting them as faceless, ghostlike figures. The very first climax with Taylor watching the Vietnamese troops in silence as they approach is perfectly shot from different angles, implying a strong sense of fear and anxiety upon the viewer. And when the tension lets up, it's perfectly relieved by a pulse-pounding sequence that moves at a fast pace. The casting in Platoon is also good as well. Charlie Sheen follows the footsteps of his father with a stellar performance and well-placed narrating (Like father, like son). Tom Berenger is good, but I found his character almost impossible to like. Naturally, I preferred William Dafoe, who would probably be my pick for the best performance in the movie. The performances of Forest Whitaker and John McGinley are also good, and the film features plenty of other soon-to-be-famous faces like Johnny Depp and Keith David. But the problem with Platoon's characterization is that it tries to cover too many different people at once, making it a bit hard to follow each character. But that has got to be the only flaw in general. And since the characters are perfectly developed, it's not much of a problem.
Platoon is simply a great movie, and it is right on the grand scale of great war films like Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and The Deer Hunter. Everything is perfect, from the action to the cinematography, and it's about as good as a war movie can get. All in all, a must see film.

The Godfather," Masterpiece
","Unbelievable as it may sound, the first time I watched The Godfather I got too tired and we stopped the tape. After that I didn't forgive myself until I finally decided to rent it again. The second time around I made it to the end and I loved it. Of all the movies I've watched, I feel that this one has had the biggest impact on me. To me, being allowed to watch The Godfather is a gift. It's more than just watching a great movie: It's like observing a timeless piece of art by Leonardo Da Vinci. The Godfather is a movie that tells the touching and invincible tail of the Corleones, an Italian family living in New York that is involved in the mafia affairs in the city. A drug lord named Virgil Sollozzo wants to start shipping drugs all over New York and asks Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to help him with his affairs. Corleone does not approve of the idea and would rather stick to his own business. Angry with the rejection, Sollozzo sends two of his thugs try to kill him, but he survives. Michael (Al Pacino), the youngest of all the sons, wants to be the man to protect his father, although the other members of the family don't want him caught up in the affair. The plot rises in levels of drama and thrills as the film goes on, and it just gets better and better. Most of the scenes easily stand out as some of the greatest moments in movie history, such as:
The beginning. What else? No one could ever forget the thought provoking scenes with Brando stroking his cat and negotiating with his close friends and relatives.Michael's assassination of the cop and Sollozzo at a small diner.
Michael being named the new godfather. The killings of family enemies during the baptism.Of course, these are not the only fantastic scenes in the movie. The Godfather also has an A++ cast, like almost everyone who has watched it will tell you. It practically made the careers of Francis Ford Coppola, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and of course, Al Pacino. Best of all, it has Marlon Brando at what could be his finest (I still haven't seen Apocalypse Now). I know it's been said many times, but I'll add my two cents anyway by saying that The Godfather is a classic and is pretty much flawless.
