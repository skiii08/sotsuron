Hereditary," The trailer lied
",The trailer made this movie look like it was about a kid whom inherited the family's 'evils' or 'burdens' or 'demons' but then turned into some kind of devil worshipping cult movie bent on possession to obtain life. No happy ending. And the actors aren't even pretty!,1,1,10,12 October 2018
Mother!," A movie has never angered me as much as this one
","If you wanna see a naked baby being passed around by strangers, have its neck broke and then that crowd eats that child...then this is the movie for you! The beginning was great but then it turned into something sick and disgusting. They movie traumatized me!",1,0,1,12 October 2018
