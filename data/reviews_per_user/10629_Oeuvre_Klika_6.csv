The Incredible Hulk," An underrated part of MCU history
","As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.",8,57,64,8 May 2019
Star Trek," Too many lens flares ;)
","At this point, everything has probably already been said about this movie, but I'll add my two cents anyway.I've recently become a fan of Star Trek (TOS) and I liked this modern take on the classic show a lot.But let's just start with the annoying element. I was well aware of this movie's reputation regarding the overuse of lens flares and I must say that that this reputation is far from undeserved. I have sensitive eyes and some scenes really hurt the poor fellows. Now this is said, let's move on to more interesting aspects.I wasn't very interested in the action sequences (especially the big ones), but that's my personal tastes, not necessarily a flaw on the movie's part.I was much more interested in the characters, and in that respect I wasn't disappointed. I thought that we could really believe that we were seeing younger versions of the characters from the original series. The blend of truthfulness to the originals and modern sensibility was very well done.My favorite character in this movie was Chekov. It helps, of course, that Anton Yelchin has been a favorite of mine for a while (I still find it hard to believe that he's no longer with us). I don't have enough words to say how much I loved the scenes they've written for him and Yelchin's acting. But I had been, before watching the movie, the most anxious to see how the trio of Kirk, Spock and Bones would be portrayed and I was more than pleased with the result! Uhura was very good as well, even if her role was somewhat small, and I hope that in future films there are more (good) female characters, because in a modern movie it seems weird to have almost only men in the main cast.Anyway, the distinct lack of bad actors in this movie is one big reason why I enjoyed it so much.The tone felt a bit weird at times. There were goofy moments that reminded me more of Marvel movies than of the Star Trek I know (which is limited to the original series so far). But I am, after all, a fan of Marvel movies, and I'd rather not have a blockbuster that takes itself too seriously. It is entertainment, after all, and we still had good moments of emotion and tension.I can't wait to see the sequels, now!Oeuvre_Klika out.",8,1,4,31 January 2017
Gone Baby Gone," Okay
","I hesitated between a score of 5/10 and 6/10 and eventually settled on 5.The performances are good, and so is the direction. The real problem lies with the scenario.The final act of the story asks a very interesting moral question. However, that question is badly asked: the story is so outrageous, nonsensical even, that it hinders the impact that it could have on the viewer. A more realistic script might have made it a really memorable movie, but it just felt like a very long TV episode from a standard crime drama.Until that final act, the story was good enough. It's failing at the part that could have made it great that eventually makes it just average.I can't say that I wouldn't recommend this movie, but don't expect a masterpiece.",5,1,2,12 June 2016
The Shining," What a disappointment
","I had heard so much about how brilliant this movie was. I finally watched it and I hated it.I give it 4 stars and not 1 because I thought it was filmed beautifully and the three leads gave great performances.But now here's what I didn't like.My main criticism is that this movie does not make sense. The story is incoherent and incomprehensible. There are visuals that look like symbolism, but are not related to anything. It looks like a movie that was supposed to be twice as long and was heavily cut, losing its meaning in the process. Maybe that's what happened?Another thing that annoyed me, especially in the first part of the movie, is the editing. Why so many dissolves? It was seriously making me dizzy. Also, the editing of all the dialogue scenes at the beginning, which are already very slow, got on my nerves. This unchanging alternance of reverse shots was making me crazy. In fact, I even wondered if all of this was a conscious choice to unsettle the viewer. But I was mainly annoyed.Last, but not least, this movie isn't scary! Why did I wait all these years to watch it, for fear of being traumatized? Sure there were very good jump scares. But making me jump is not the same as scaring me. Some of the 'scary' visuals, as I already complained earlier, were so unrelated to anything that they made me laugh rather than scaring me. And I didn't feel any tension because nothing in the story made sense to me. It was all disjointed and weird.",4,71,110,3 May 2019
Drive," Beautiful, but shallow
","I didn't know much about Drive before I watched it, other than it had been acclaimed in Cannes and that it was one of the iconic roles played by Ryan Gosling, one that is very often mentioned when talking about this actor.Now I've seen the movie, I've enjoyed it, but I don't think it's going to stay with me very long. There was nothing in it that would make it memorable to me.I'm not going to deny Nicolas Winding Refn his Best Director Award. The direction is certainly exemplary. There isn't one shot of this movie that doesn't look good.Drive is, in fact, a very 'artistic' movie (as opposed to a 'commercial' one, if these distinctions mean anything). It has a dreamy soundtrack, stylish and moody lighting, a slow beginning, long shots, few dialog. However, it also has a minimalist plot, a lack of psychological depth and moments of gruesome violence, which, at the end of the day, make it nothing more than a glossy B-Movie.",7,0,0,3 December 2017
The Man Who Would Be King," Enhanced by the actors
","What a peculiar story! It's almost a philosophical tale, and certainly not what I expected when I chose to watch this movie (I haven't read the original work). The Caine/Connery duo works terrifically well and is in my opinion the main attraction to 'The man who would be king'. Although the story was thrilling enough for me never to be bored, I thought that the direction lacked rhythm, especially in the first two thirds of the movie. In fact, I thought that this movie suffered from the same problem as some other literary adaptations that give the impression that they rest too much on their source material and struggle to find their own unity.I've always enjoyed 'exotic' adventure stories, written at a time where a big part of the world could still be a mystery, even if it means putting up with the condescending attitude of the westerners of the time. Of course, today, the Victorian Englishmen are hardly less exotic to us than their oriental contemporaries. I don't know what the tone of Kipling's short story was, but the movie, at least, seemed to me to be watching the protagonists with a distance appropriate for our time, without, however, cutting us completely from any identification or empathy (it would have lost much of its impact otherwise). In a few words, I had a lot of fun watching this movie, but I didn't find it memorable. The actors' performances, on the other hand, are (the actor playing Billy Fish was excellent, too!) and they're well worth the watch.",7,1,5,15 November 2015
