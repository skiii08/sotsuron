The King's Speech," a performance driven masterpiece
",This year James Franco had to act against a rock and Jeff Bridges had to rehash The Duke himself but nothing beats Colin Farrell having to stutter. This is the performance of the year if not the decade and it having come out in theaters in the Christmas season of 2010 I almost had to wait 10 more years to make that statement. Colin Firth plays the stuttering King George VI whose wife The Queen Of England hires Lionel a speech teacher fantastically performed by Gwoffrey Rush. Lionel's an offbeat guy who has certain methods (the only ones that happen to work in all of England) to stop King George VI's stuttering. These could of easily been annoying performance that could have both been way over the top but both Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush mix the right amount of goofiness and heart into their performances.The King's Speech comes without flaws it's beautifully directed terrifically executed but most of all it's acted to the highest degree. This is the best acted film of this year and I can't see anyone else but Colin Firth winning best actor..he throws himself into the role and is painfully realistic.,10,1,3,11 February 2011
Moneyball," Statistics VS. Raw Talent In 'Moneyball'
","Professional baseball player Rocky Bridges has a famous quote that says the average man believes he can do three things...build a fire, run a hotel, and manage a baseball team. This quote, although I summarized it, describes Billy Beane in more ways than one. Moneyball is based on a book that is based on real life events and stars Brad Pitt as the one and only Billy Beane. Moneyball was the type of book no one would ever thought could be made into a movie, but it was and it is.Now, before I go into depth about what I thought of Moneyball, the first thing I have to say is that this is Brad Pitt's best performance to date. With one of my least favorite movies of the year, The Tree Of Life being released this year, I was not looking forward to seeing Brad Pitt in another film, but I am surprised to see I absolutely loved him in this film. Now, as for the movie itself, it's fantastic. The whole statistics vs. raw talent idea is smart and the movie is both funny and touching. It gets very funny when there is dialogue between Beane and Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), they park an irresistible and funny charm, and it is touching when Beane and his daughter, Casey interact. I also loved how the film balances these two plots with pinpoint perfection. Moneyball is great from the first second to the last, and one of my favorite films of the year so far..so go check it out.",Null,0,0,6 October 2011
Frost_Nixon," An enthralling and brave piece of true American cinema
","For anyone who's ever read the news, made the news, heard of the news, or even said news would know about the Frost-Nixon debate. Ron Howard has now made an enthralling telling of it. It has a half-documentary, and half-fictional feel that works perfectly. Michael Sheen is excellent as David Frost, a news reporter who tries to set up an interview with infamous president Richard Nixon (Frank Langella). When David finally gets Richard on his news show, as always, Richard turns into Tricky Dick, wasting David's time with nonsense stories. The supporting players such as Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, and Oliver Platt also had to the witty excitement to be had here. But, while reading this review, remember it is not meant to be a fun movie, it's just surprisingly kind of fun. Ron Howard has made a marvelous movie, which we all know he can do, blending a great mix of drama and thrills. The movie is not bland like it could have easily been, but instead is a witty, Shakesperean-like film that is a perfect example of a definite Oscar movies. It doesn't get any better than this- smart, witty, enthralling, bold, brilliant, and daring. This is definitely a must see for anyone who's anyone.",10,1,2,18 August 2009
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Forever is only the beginning..ain't that the truth?
","Roger Ebert, one of the most widely beloved film critics once had a quote about the infamous Larry Bishop gangster spoof Mad Dog Time. That quote went '''Mad Dog Time'' is the first movie I have seen that does not improve on the sight of a blank screen viewed for the same length of time.' That's how I ultimately feel about The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1. It is a terrible film that, despite its best efforts, turns into a big pile of nothingness. What did the filmmakers want to accomplish here? Well, there are a couple thing such as money, cabbage, and oh yeah, dough. This film was made on the assumption that millions of teenage girls are going to throw down their allowance to go see it. As I went to a public theater to see this and not an advanced screening, their assumptions was right. I was the only male in the theater. No boyfriends, husbands, males by themselves, ETC. May I also mention that there was a very limited range of females under 16 in the theater. Seriously, who thinks of this crap? This film can be summed up in a simple, short explanation-it's a soap opera made for young women instead of middle aged women. I'm not trying to sound sexist or derogatory but this is the way the world works..movies are made specifically for teenage girls to throw their allowance down. Unfortunately, this one, like most of them is petrifying to watch.",Null,7,9,6 December 2011
The Hangover," By far the year's best film so far
","Yes, a raunchy comedy revolving around guys who have had a few too many is the year's best film so far. It's not only the gallons of laughs that Mike Tyson and Zach Galifianakis are only the start of, it's that this is a great mystery film. The mystery revolves around Doug (Justin Bartha), a man who's about to get married. He goes to Vegas with his friends Phil (Bradley Cooper), and Stu (Ed Helms), and his bride-to-be's brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis). Their perfect night in Vegas turns into a hangover for the ages. They've lost Doug, and can not remember a thing from the night before. They must go out to find Doug. The night before involves a tiger, a chicken, a baby, a stripper named Jade (Heather Graham), who Stu accidentally marries, and Mike Tyson. The real joy of this movie is that we're as interested to figure out what the hell happened as much as they do. You feel like you're part of the mystery. The conclusion is nothing less than perfect. When the end credits roll, you see a bunch of pictures on a camera that show what really went down that night. It is the perfect finale to a movie that can only be described as a funnier, raunchier version of Dude, Where's My Car?",10,4,9,20 June 2009
Star Trek," Very good, but over-hyped
","It's rare to find a good remake of a retro show that fits the time that they are remaking it. That's why I was happy to find Star Trek, a very good addition into the over-hyped list of good films. It's a nice mix of action, humor, and drama that did not quite deserve the recognition it got. Chris Pine play James T. Kirk, a troublemaker as a kid, now a space captain as an adult. Pine does a good job at following in Shatner's shoes. Zachary Quinto as well does a good job of following in Nimoy's shoes as Spock. I can't say they live up to Shatner's or Nimoy's greatness, but they certainly do do a very good job. It's an over-recognized film that's certainly still a very good film. I can also say anyone looking for the Leonard Nimoy cameo won't be let down and the supporting cast adds to the fun. But ultimately it's not the great film I was reading about, it's just a good film. It's very entertaining, ultimately satisfying film. Simon Pegg shows up towards the end as Montgomery Scott, and is hilarious and interesting, and it's a great performance. This is a fun and satisfying film that won't have you talking after the movie about it, and it's certainly not groundbreaking, just a simply good film.",8,2,6,13 August 2009
Iron Man 2," Currently waiting for Iron Man 3.....
","After the surprisingly fantastic Iron Man, old and new faces join forces for Iron Man 2, an equally fantastic sequel. After long months of waiting for this film, it exceeded my expectations and made me want the Iron Man series to be never ending. There's something about Robert Downey Jr's sarcastic tone and out there charisma that suits this character (no pun intended). Mickey Rourke & Sam Rockwell are now villains Ivan & Justin, two competitors of Tony Stark (Downey, JR). Don Cheadle plays James Rhodes, AKA Warhead, Scarlett Johansson plays Natalie, Samuel L. Jackson plays Nick Fury, Jon Favreau plays Happy, Paul Bettany plays Jarvis, Leslie Bibb plays Christine, and Garry Shandling plays Senator Stern. Guess what? They're all excellent. Shandling, especially, who has some of the funniest lines I have seen thus far this year. Rockwell has one of the funniest opening scenes in the film. There's so much to like about Iron Man 2, that, although not flawless, you forget its flaws, and just enjoy the spectacular ride you are to have. I can't decide what I want first, for Iron Man 3 to come out or for this to be in my DVD collection. Either way, see this film right away.",10,11,21,8 May 2010
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," From Michael Scott to Ladies Man, From Blue Valentine to Crazy Stupid Love
","When Steve Carrell left The Office, I was about as sad as I have ever been about a TV show. When Ryan Gosling struggled in both Half Nelson and Blue Valentine, I was about as sad as I have ever been about a movie. With those two statements being said, I really wanted a light romantic comedy, I was tired of all the sadness. I am glad to report I actually did not get that, at least not out of Steve Carrell's plot. I could have never imagined this film working as a drama..but now I could never imagine it working as a comedy. While Gosling is charming and does create a good amount of laughs in the film, the main focus is on Carrell's character, who's just a sad sack character. That being said, I loved not only Cal (Carrell's character), but I also loved Carrell himself in the film. Now that James Spader is joining The Office, and now that Carrell is throwing himself into a dramatic role, and doing a very good job at it, I could see myself really not missing Michael Scott much at all. Also, there are a lot of attractive women in this film, such as Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, and Marisa Tomei. They all have really good plots as well, especially Marisa Tomei. Kevin Bacon is also quite funny as Moore's co-worker/new boyfriend. To end my review, I must mention Robbie (Jonah Bobo) falling in love with Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), which I may have even liked more than Gosling or Carrell's plot. It's such a sweet plot, and Tipton and Bobo are rising young stars. Overall, don't go into Crazy Stupid Love expecting Carrell's next Date Night or Gosling's next Blue Valentine, go in expecting something in between those two. If you wish for either of those two and not the other, you're going to be disappointed, otherwise, just like me, you'll love it.",Null,1,6,29 July 2011
Public Enemies," A good but overlong and limited story movie
","The new drama, Public Enemies features great performances by Johnny Depp, Marion Cotillard, Christian Bale, good-looking set pieces, and an entertaining if not detailed enough story. However, it is overlong, and does not feature a good enough back story of John Dillinger (Johnny Depp). Marion Cotillard is great as his girlfriend, Billy. Christian Bale is as well good as his hunter Agent Melvin Purvis. The movie is a good escape for a summer blockbuster that doesn't feature anyone with superpowers, or even any big battle climax at the end. There are no transforming cars, no Spock, no gross-out jokes, no sappy romance, etc. It's an original summer escape from reality (although this is based on a true story.) By the end, you feel like you may have been sitting in your theater seats too long, but you feel satisfied. The performances and limited story (it's a complaint, but it also helps) make the movie more than what some of these forced crime dramas are now. I felt like I got my moneys worth, and then some. Definitely not a perfect movie, but a very, very good one. Do yourself a favor, and go see it.",7,0,1,5 July 2009
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Not bad, not great, just kind of in between
","With all the crap littering the screens lately, I am neither fortunate nor unfortunate to announce, while not a good movie, Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time is better than most of the crap littering the screens lately. It's a muddled mess, sure, but with Robin Hood boring up the screens, you could do a lot worse. It's simply disposable family entertainment. This is based on a video game, and is one of the best video game adaptations I've seen, which is far from saying much. The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Dastan, a young orphan from the streets who was adopted by Nizam (Ben Kingsley). Gyllenhaal and Kingsley, usually two fine actors, are bland here. The show really belongs to Alfred Molina, who steals every scene he's in as Sheik, who helps Dastan on his quest. He's unpredictable, delightful, and brings some much needed comic relief to this film. Just like Robin Hood, the old fashioned stuff doesn't work in Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time, it feels too put in. Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time would look better on the big screen, but a great cast can't ever save this film, so you can probably just skip it because it won't be worth the money paid to see it on the big screen & it won't be effective enough on the small screen.",5,7,17,28 May 2010
Pirate Radio," One of the funniest comedies of the year
","Pirate Radio (originally named The Boat That Rocked in the UK, but got a name change for its US release) is the story of a rock and roll radio station in the 60s. It's also one of the funniest films of the year. An all star cast leads the film into high waters. Phillip Seymour Hoffman stars as The Count, the main DJ, and Bill Nighy is Quentin, the boat manager of sorts. Nick Frost is hysterical as the DJ Dave. Nick Frost, hilarious with Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz and Shaun Of The Dead does a good job of leaving his roles with Pegg and doing a role all his own here. But I haven't gotten to the best part yet. You ready for the best part? OK then. Rhys Ifans is hysterical as Angus, a re-hired DJ who's sexually attractive to all. The film is filled with great rock music from the 60's. The rock and roll music just adds to the fun. There's also a great subplot about a government worker named Alastair (Kenneth Branagh) trying to find a loophole to shut the radio station, Pirate Radio down as they are not really doing anything illegal. I recommend you see Pirate Radio right away if you're looking for an extremely fun time and one of the funniest films of the year.",10,2,5,25 November 2009
"I Love You, Man"," I can't decide what/who's more amazing-Jason Segel, Paul Rudd, or the movie
","If you've ever seen Paul Rudd or Jason Segel in anything, you know both of them are amazingly funny. If you haven't seen either of them in anything, go see I Love You Man, and if you have, still go see I Love You Man. It's a very funny movie with very funny performances beyond even Segal and Rudd. Rashida Jones is hilarious as Peter (Rudd)'s fiancée. Jamie Pressly and Jon Favreau are fantastic as a bickering couple. J.K. Simmons and Andy Samberg score a ton of laughs as Peter's dad and gay brother. The story is of Peter, a man who upon realizing he has no 'man' friends, meets a likable man named Sydney (Segel) at an open house, since Peter is a realtor. A very funny joke is that it's Lou Ferringo's open house. The movie is both non-stop funny, and very, very sweet. That said, to you parents, leave your kids at the babysitter. This has a lot of cussing, masturbation jokes, and drinking. This is such a breath of fresh air. The characters are not 1-D, they feel like real people, and the jokes are constantly funny if not extremely raunchy. Do you here that parents? It's time to drop your kids at the babysitter and start to go to the movies by yourselves again.",10,1,4,12 August 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Not bad, not good, somewhere in between
","I was a big fan of all 3 X-Men film. That's why I saw the leaked version as soon as I could. When I saw the leaked version, it was pretty good. Maybe because I was happy to find the leaked version. I was not able to believe my eyes when I saw that the non-leaked version was way more lame than the leaked version. The movie starts out with Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Victor (Liev Schreiber) as kids. They soon become Wolverine and Sabertooth. They were brothers as kids who will soon become enemies. The movie has surprisingly very little action. Even know people like Will i Am and Ryan Reynolds keep showing up as side superheroes and giving their piece of the action pie. The movie is overdosed with too much plot to bring us too little action. That said, the cast, especially Jackman and Schreiber do bring some fun, taking their piece in the action rotation. But there's just not enough action here. There's not enough fun to be had here, not enough stuff that sparked my interest. This is not a particularly terrible movie, just not a recommendable one.",5,2,5,13 August 2009
Terminator Salvation," Come on, people, this is a decent action film, not great, but decent
","The new action-thriller, Terminator Salvation is not great, but if it proves one thing: an action film can be mindless and moodless and still be good. Terminator 3 was terrible, yet a lot of people still liked it. Terminator Salvation is good, but people seem to hate it. This is a sign that more and more people these days have to see sophisticated films in the theater, even if it means seeing mostly bad films. Yes, there are a lot of good sophisticated films, but when something as brainless and moodless as this comes around, I'm still able to enjoy it. This movie nicely follows two stories mashed into one: John Connor (Christian Bale) waking up and discovering a whole new world, and then meeting Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), and Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) fighting war on the other side of the new world. I respect, and quite like what they're trying to do here: telling us what we might of missed in the other Terminator movies. The film is nothing new or special, but just a good old recommendable fun time at the movies. PS, anyone looking forward to the Arnold Schwarzenegger cameo will not be let down.",7,5,9,13 August 2009
500 Days of Summer," Finally.... a smart, funny, and original romantic comedy
","As I dig into every romantic comedy ever made, I have picked out very few that are like 500 Days Of Summer. Few are like 500 Days Of Summer in few are actually good. The story is structured perfectly, going back from day 150 to day 7 too day 200 to day 3. The story starts off with greeting card writer Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, handing in an excellent performance). He believes that he will not be happy until he falls in love with his soul mate. But when Summer (Zooey Deschanel, also handing in an excellent performance) becomes the new assistant to his boss, he automatically falls for her. The only problem is that Summer does not believe in love. But in one instance, they fall in love. The difference between this romance and about 95% of the romances in other rom-coms is that this romance did not happen in the snap of a finger. They actually take their time to show how they fell in love. The supporting players such as comedian Geoffrey Arend as Tom's friend and co-worker, McKenzie, and Matthew Gray Gubler (he plays Dr. Spencer Reid on TV's Criminal Minds) as Tom's friend Paul add to the laughs and the delight. Although not quite groundbreaking, it's one of the best films of the year so far, and I highly recommend you go see it.",9,2,4,19 July 2009
Yes Man," A funny, light and enjoyable comedy
","The comedy, Yes Man stars Jim Carrey as Carl Allen, a man, who upon realizing he's losing his friends since he never wants to see them, agrees to go to a seminar as asked by an old friend named Nick (John Michael Higgins). The seminar is a yes seminar, in which a man named Terrence Bundley (Terrence Stamp) talks about the importance of saying yes to everything. Carl makes a deal with Terrence that he will say yes to everything, or else have bad luck for not saying yes. This leads to meeting a gorgeous biker chick/aspiring musician named Allison (Zooey Deschanel). The relationship, although involving an age difference is sweet, tender, and funny. Carl soon figures out the most important lesson of them all: you will not succeed in life being the boring, always refusing guy he is. As you dig deeper in the story, Carl soon figures out how to live life (going to nightclubs, traveling the world, getting hyper on red bull, etc.) Rhys Darby also steals some scenes as Carl's wacky boss, Norm. Although the movie certainly does have its flaws, and it is not anything new, it is an enjoyable comedy you should definitely see.",7,7,10,10 July 2009
Knocked Up," Extremely funny and also greatly touching
","I saw The 40-Year Old Virgin, and when I saw Seth Rogen, I thought he was funny, but did not see him as one of the funniest people out there. Now, Knocked Up came around, and I saw just how funny Rogen is. Here he plays slacker Ben, who has a one-night stand with innocent hard worker Allison (Katherine Heigl). Soon, Allison figures out she's pregnant. Ben has to then unexpectedly step in and take charge knowing he is soon going to be a father. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd generate a ton of laughs as couple Debbie and Pete. They are Allison's sister and her husband. Both Allison & Ben, and Debbie & Pete generate some very funny and also sweet moments as they struggle through couple hood. People like Jason Segel, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Mike Starr, and Charlyne Yi are hilarious as Ben's slacker friends. It's great to see a raunchy comedy that's not aggressive but indeed very sweet. This really is a great film, mixing very funny jokes and touching drama to make a film that could of been a complete failure, and instead is a very sweet and extremely funny film.",10,1,4,11 August 2009
Shutter Island," Too Much Going On For One Sitting
","Shutter Island is a Gothic thriller about Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), two police officers investigating a disappearance at an insane asylum run by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). The film's first 15 minutes are fantastic, setting the mood just right, but it gets too weird from then on. This is directed by Martin Scorsese, a usually wonderful director. Scorsese's best films investigate the main character and peeling back his or hers layers. That's just where the problem starts with Shutter Island. The film has too much going on and never gets to fully peel back the layers of any of the characters. There are Teddy having nightmares about the war & his wife, the disappearance plot, and a bunch of twists & turns. It plays mind games with its audiences for 2 hours before making sense with its final 20 minute twist. That brings me to my next point, the film is too long. It's 2 hours & 20 minutes, which is far too long for such a weird & uneven film. I've always thought Mark Ruffalo was underrated & a good actor, but he's given nothing to do with his character. His character is extremely dull. Scorsese's use of sound is also torturing. Overall, Shutter Island spends too much time stalling and ends up being unsatisfactory in the end. I can't recommend it to anyone, because life is too short to spend 2 hours & 20 minutes watching this.",2,5,10,30 March 2010
Watchmen," Visually stunning, smart, thrilling, fun, original, and just plain great
","A great all star cast is just the beginning of Watchmen, quite possibly the greatest superhero film ever made. The film starts out with a superhero being thrown through a plate-glass window by a mysterious man. Later, we figure out that man being thrown through the plate-glass window is the old version of The Comedian. Now, there is a new Comedian, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. He is not in very big touch with his superhero pals. The world is having a lot of trouble. People are dying left and right, and Richard Nixon is still president. The movie has a lot of visually stunning moments, and you can't help but to like all the characters here. They are superheroes in their own way. They do not have any desire to prove that they are efficient superheroes. You admire them for that. I was dying to see this film since I heard about it about a year before it opened. The film not only exceeded expectations, it was more amazing than I thought it would be, and I thought is was gonna be a pretty damn amazing film. The three hour film length is actually good because nothing needs to get cut out, everything is too good. Also, the soundtrack choice is perfect, playing songs in the background you would not expect to be played in the background, but they play perfectly with the movie. Definitely check this amazing film out...it's great.",10,2,5,31 July 2009
Knowing," 100 ways to make a bad movie: Knowing movie review
","The new thriller, Knowing is going to be useful for one thing in the future. That thing is to show film students the kind of movie you should never make. Nicolas Cage stars as Professor John Koelster, who upon teaching his students everything happens for a reason, picks up a paper his son took, and realizes the numbers on it show all of the major death crashes since the year the paper was made. The unrealistic part of this is that John would never actually recognize that the numbers of dates of death crashes. Rose Byrne comes in as Diana Wayland, a woman helping John. They have no chemistry at all. But what do you need good chemistry for when this movie is already this bad? The movie is admittedly creepy, it has some good crashes, and a creepy beginning, but the movie itself was so terrible it didn't matter. The movie's problem is it knows how to be creepy, but not how to be good. Towards the end, the movie becomes predictable. You know, but cannot believe what is about to happen. Be sure that you have enough of a brain in order to know to skip this one.",1,3,6,23 June 2009
Salt," An excellent movie..until the end
","Salt stars Angelina Jolie as Evelyn Salt, a woman on the run after being fingered as a Russian spy. The film then turns into an action chase thriller that turns out to be surprisingly excellent..until the end. I won't give away the ending to you, but I will say while it sets up for a sequel which I will certainly see, it does it in the dullest, blandest, most random & stupid way. That said, I'm still recommending the film for what it is. Jolie is good as an action star, which she didn't get to prove in the Lara Croft films because those were terrible. Liev Schreiber plays Ted Winter, a fellow agent who has to decide between his personal interests with Salt & the fact that he has to catch her. It's all done in such a loopy, fun way, that the ending doesn't seem to matter. The film also does a good job of leaving mixed signals for the audience so you can decide for yourself the real question: Who Is Evelyn Salt? The film has a lot of good twists. Right when you think you know what's going to happen, the film throws another twist at you. Overall, Salt works because of the good action and good performances by the cast. To call it a masterpiece would be a little steep, but it is an excellent & fun time at the movies.",9,2,9,25 July 2010
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Goes nowhere with big laughs
","One of the many problems with making a weird comedy involving spies or psychics or wars or something in that them, you know, something that about people who fight for a living is that it often feels too weird to be funny. The Men Who Stare At Goats is weird, but it's funny. The film starts out with a journalist named Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) being dumped by his girlfriend when his girlfriend falls for his boss. He decides the only way to get her back is to write the best story ever. His resource is his friend, Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), a man who is a psychic who can kill goats with his mind. Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey are especially funny as Lyn's new age mentor, Bill Django, and Lyn and Bill's rival, Larry Hooper, a fellow student psychic. The film is admittedly plot less and pointless. The non-story goes nowhere, but it does so while creating huge laughs. The film is weird, and it will not be for everyone. If you do not enjoy weird films, this is not for you. It is very strange and may too pointless, plot less, and/or slow paced for some. That said, anyone looking for a strange and funny time at the movies that does not require you to use your brain that much, this film is just what you need.",7,3,5,5 December 2009
Shrek Forever After," Dull, bland and forgettable, but not as bad as Shrek The Third
","Shrek 1 & 2 were both masterpieces in their own right, and Shrek The Third was awful. Shrek Forever After is mediocre but now this series must come to an end. The new car smell of the series has worn off, and it just feels like they're doing the same thing over and over and over again. This is just disposable family entertainment meant for parents to spend $10 to take their children to it, and this movie is alright enough so that if the kids like it, the parents won't mind. All the old voices (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, Cameron Diaz) return, along with new voices like Jane Lynch, Craig Robinson, Kathy Griffin, Kristen Schaal, Mary Kay Place, and scene stealing Walt Bohrn as Rumpelstiltskin, the mean, cynical man who cons Shrek into never being born. This is basically an animated, ogre-filled version of It's A Wonderful Life. That might of been a good idea if the execution were actually good, but it's dull, bland, and forgettable. The Pied Piper comes in as a character playing a bounty hunter role, and he's awesome, but the good outweighs the bad and unless you have kids begging you to see Shrek Forever After, then you'd be better off just skipping it.",4,2,7,30 May 2010
The Love Guru," Honestly, I'd rather sleep on a bed of nails
","How, with such a good cast, can The Love Guru be so painfully unfunny. How can a cast of Ben Kingsley, Stephen Colbert, Jessica Alba, Mike Myers, Verne Troyer, Justin Timberlake, Jim Gaffigan, and many more very talented people be in such a deadly, poisonous piece of junk like The Love Guru? There's nothing funny about this movie. Nothing here is less than completely painful. It's like someone stabbing you in the back and then finishing you off by punching you in the groin. That's how much fun it is. It's quite possibly more painful than that. This movie deserves to be buried in the middle of nowhere. If there was a negative score on IMDb, I would rate it the lowest possible negative score. I'm not even going to go into the plot because I'm too mad reviewing this in the first place. Not a single funny moment in this whole movie, ever minute painful. Mike Meyers has become the anti-Christ of film makers. Never see this movie, even if yours or someone else's live(s) depends on it. Just, in a nutshell, definitely skip this one, you'll thank me later, since you got to skip the pain that is The Love Guru.",1,8,16,11 August 2009
District 9," An overrated, disgusting, repetitive, stupid, and boring film
","I've officially given up on mankind. If so many people like crap like this, then the earth might not exist in 10 years. The movie is essentially telling the true story of people locked up if they ar blacks in Johannesburg as aliens. Although, in the film, they are literally aliens. It's a boring film that falls into people's body's splitting open, and overlong gun shoot outs too frequently. It's really a boring movie, and also very stupid. People are raving about how the aliens are fully developed- I didn't find them even close to developed. Everyone's also talking about the great twist at the end-there is no great twist- just an obvious ending. Everyone's talking about how it's a late, great summer action-sci-fi-thriller, I just found it boring. It's not thrilling, it's not action packed, and the special effects are just plain awful. The main character is Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a jerk who locks up the aliens who deservedly gets accused of doing sexual things to the aliens. Overall, it's a god-awful film, an overrated piece of complete crap that never reaches, nor shows its full potential.",1,17,42,19 August 2009
Bridesmaids," Knocked Up meets The Wedding Planner
","It's not easy to have a movie that appeals to both genders of audience. A couple films have successfully done it this year-The Adjustment Bureau, No Strings Attached, Win/Win, ETC, but Bridesmaids is the tip of the iceberg. As written by star Kristen Wiig and directed by Paul Fieg whose only other 2 movies include the flops I Am David and Unaccompanied Minors, Bridesmaids is a movie whose excellence I simply am having trouble translating to words, even as I sit here typing right now. The film stars Kristen Wiig as Annie, an unsuccessful bakery owner who is asked to be the maid of honor at her best, and only friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph)'s wedding. There she meets the bridesmaids, rich and snobby Helen (Rose Byrne), married Becca (Ellie Kemper), unhappy mother Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), and sex-crazed, wacky Megan (Melissa McCarthy, who walks away with every scene she's in.) One of my favorite things about Bridesmaids is that there's not a bad apple in the bunch. By that I mean everyone, from the bridesmaids to the supporting cast, adds their own little special touch to the movie. Not a lot of movies have made me wish they were longer, especially at 2 hours, but Bridesmaids falls right into that short list. Bridesmaids may not be the best film of the year so far (Win/Win and Bill Cunningham: New York top that category,) but it's the funniest film of the year so far, and even, in years, and one you absolutely need to check out.",10,4,9,17 May 2011
Kick-Ass," More than lives up to its title
","The superhero genre was starting to wear a bit thin in my opinion. Right when I thought I'd given up on superheroes, I saw Kick-Ass & all my doubts about the genre quickly faded away. The film starts out with Dave (Aaron Johnson), your stereotypical high school student with two good friends and a pretty normal life. One day, in a comic book store, he tells his friends that he wonders why no one's ever attempted to be a superhero. Dave then transforms into Kick-Ass. When your main character is the least interesting part of the film, it can easily be a good sign or a bad sign. In this case, it's definitely a good sign that Kick-Ass is the least interesting character in the film. Chloe Moretz, coming off her excellent performances in 500 Days Of Summer continues to show how great of an actress she is by stealing the show as Hit-Girl. After being in a row of bad films such as Next, Knowing,The Wicker Man & G-Force, Nicolas Cage returns in top form as Big Daddy, Hit-Girl's dad. Mark Strong is excellent as the bad guy Frank & Christopher Mintz-Plasse is excellent as his son, Chris who dresses up as Red Mist. Overall, Kick-Ass will satisfy even people who are not into the superhero genre, but it certainly helps.",10,6,19,19 April 2010
The Hurt Locker," Quite possibly the best war film ever....but without a doubt one of the three best war films ever
","Now a days it seems very hard to make a tense and smart action-thriller. I am here to declare that The Hurt Locker manages to do that and more. The story is fresh, and the action builds up so tensely you forget you're watching a movie. The story is so involving that you forget the movie is two hours and ten minutes because you're sucked in so much. The story is about a group of army men, who upon having their last bomb disarmer killed in a bomb accident, hires a new one. The one they hire is named William James (Jeremy Renner, turning in a fantastic performance.) He does things his own way, much to the dislike of the leader, JT Sanborn. It starts to become intense being in the moment not knowing if William is making the right decision, or if JT is making the right decision. The fact that a lot of these bombs are seemingly impossible to disarm makes you on the edge of your seat. This movie has as much, if not more authentic thrills and chills as any horror movie, thriller, or action film of at least the past 15 years. This is by far my favorite film of the year so far, and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you do not go see it as fast as you can.",10,37,59,19 July 2009
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Very good film for the whole family
","Many people may have forgotten the book, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs which sold millions of copies. After years of acclaim and forget, they have made it into an enjoyable family film. People who have read the book and remember it clearly do not have to read the following, but I feel like many people have forgotten about the book. This is the story of Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader), who ever since childhood has wanted to invent something everyone would love. After screwing up many inventions, including putting spray on shoes that don't come off on himself, he invents a machine that converts water into food. I want to explain something. He lives on an island named Swallow Falls that only eats sardines because there is nothing else to eat. Now, when he makes food fall from the sky, everyone loves him. The film is funny, and sweet, and out of all the kids films I've seen in 3D this year, this is the one that uses its 3D to the fullest effect so far this year, but that might change. Kids will love it, and adults will not be able to hold themselves back from laughing either. A really enjoyable film for anyone, and highly recommended.",8,11,17,18 September 2009
Clash of the Titans," For better or for worse
","Clash Of The Titans is the remake of the 1981 film with the same name that starred Laurence Olivier. In the remake, the story changes in certain aspects, and stays the same in others. The differences & similarities are for better or for worse. Some differences are good, such as the less hideous version of Medusa. Some differences are bad, such as the choice to make almost everything CGI. The similarities are mostly all for better, it's more the differences that make me need to add on the for worse part. The film's very loud, which did not help me enjoy the film. This is a mostly very bland and dull remake. If you want to see a good Hollywood remake, skip this and watch The Wolfman remake. The film's actors such as Liam Neeson and Sam Worthington are alright, but could be better considering what talented people they are. I would not advise you to see this film, but if you have to, see it at a cheap morning show on the big screen. Even then, though, this film is not worth your time or money. This film had so much potential, and I was excited to tell everyone how good this film is, but unfortunately, I have to tell my honest opinion, and my honest opinion is this movie was 85% bad, 5% good, 10% passable. Overall, the film's hard to get into and it's not worth the time or money you will have to invest to see this film.",4,1,5,2 April 2010
The Hangover Part II," The wolfpack is back..,kind of
","Two years ago, a movie came out that was so original and hilarious that it became the highest grossing r- rated comedy of all time. That movie was The Hangover, and now it's time for the obligatory sequel. With this sequel comes the most disappointing film thus far this year. That's not to say The Hangover 2 doesn't have its fair share of laugh out loud moments, and that's not to say it's the worst film of the year so far...it's just to say I was expecting so much more. The Hangover 2 is an exact copy of the first one except in the aspects of originality, humor, and just plain fun. In the original, Alan, Stu, and Phil lost the groom, Doug (who was left out of the gang again in this one...which felt really forced.) Now, Stu's getting married and they lose Teddy, Stu's fiancées younger, much more successful brother. Just like the first one, they have to go find out just what happened by going through a series of wacky events, but these events aren't wacky, they're just forced which ruins the whole point of the film. I won't tell the many people who are going to see this anyway no matter what I say what ends up happening to Teddy, but let's just say it's pretty mean spirited and dull. Also, Ken Jeong returns as Chow, which feels really tacked on and ruins every scene Chow is in. Overall, The Hangover 2 is very disappointing if not at times laugh out loud funny. At the average of $10 a ticket, it's just not worth it to see it in theaters. I'd say wait for Redbox or Netflix, if even that.",6,4,6,27 May 2011
Friends with Benefits," The D**k in a box guy and Meg from Family Guy are 'Friends With Benefits'
","In early 2011, we got No Strings Attached, a film I liked, didn't love, may I remind you, but liked. Now, not much further down the road we get the exact same premise. Don't believe how similar the premises are? Well, this movie is called Friends With Benefits, and No Strings Attached's tag line was 'friendship has its benefits.' Now, you're probably wondering...as an overall romantic comedy..how does Friends With Benefits compare to No Strings Attached? Well...they're almost the same..almost. I liked, but didn't love both of them. That being said, Friends With Benefits is fairly smarter, funnier, and more touching than No Strings Attached. This fact probably comes from the fact that No Strings Attacked was much more puerile, albeit funny humor, while Friends With Benefits is more mature about its sense of humor. Now, that was the first part of my review. I'm sorry if people found it pointless for me to compare one movie to another, but they're kind of asking for it. The second part of my review will consist of Friends With Benefits as a movie on its own. Now, I got to say, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis work very well together. The chemistry is very fun here, and create a lot of raunchy laughs. That being said, Richard Jenkins as Justin Timberlake's father adds some much needed heart to the film, because you can't have a romantic comedy without having some heart. I also really liked Jenna Elfman as Timberlake's sister. That being said, there's such an unneeded amount of predictability and a lack of originality here. Overall, Friends With Benefits is a nice movie, whose central premise is not very original, but all the really solid performances and chemistry amongst its stars keep it afloat.",Null,1,2,27 July 2011
Puss in Boots," Spoiler: Shrek's not in this one
","Puss In Boots follows the origin story of, well, Puss In Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas) and how he became who he was in the Shrek films. I've always liked Puss In Boots as a character and was really exciting to have fun with this film. That being said, this film is like mediocre Chinese food...it's just alright when you're experiencing it but after an hour, you'll feel as if you experienced nothing. This film feels like a lot of movies I've seen this year where one scene is set up just to provide balance to another scene. Also, the whole relationship between Puss and Humpty Dumpty is simultaneously confusing and stupid. I may be sounding cynical here, but the film does have a very funny moments and even a touching moment, but it's just not worth paying ticket prices for. Speaking of which, I saw this film as an Imax 3D experience, and the film is mostly dialogue, so the Imax didn't work, but the 3D was some of the better 3D I've seen in a while. Although I tend to write as long a review as possible, I really have nothing to say about this film except the film's best for a night when you want to distract your kids or you don't mind watching a very mediocre film to please yourself or your kids.",Null,0,3,2 November 2011
Taken," A great action film, and Liam Neeson steals the show
","The problem with a lot of action-thrillers is that the guy who is forced to step in and save the day does not have any experience. That's why I am happy to report Taken is here. Here Liam Neeson plays Bryan Mills, an ex-FBI agent who is forced to use his skills to save his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). The film is about how Bryan, after much skepticism lets his daughter, Kim go to Europe with her friend, Amanda (Katie Cassidy). Just by the title, it is needless to say Bryan is right. Kim and Amanda share a cab ride with a man named Peter (Nicolas Giraud), only to figure out he is part of a large group that kidnaps women to sell them for prostitution. Now Bryan is forced to step in and use his learned skills to kick some butt and save his daughter. This is truly a great action film. The acting is great, the action fantastic, and the movie is fast-paced, and despite a slow beginning never skips a beat. Neeson is great here, perfectly mixing sweetness and harshness to make one of the most surprisingly memorable movie character. You also enjoy seeing Neeson using non-violent, clever methods to save his daughter. So if you're looking for a good time at the movies, go see Taken.",10,3,3,1 August 2009
Alice in Wonderland," What happened Tim Burton?
","So far this year has been the year of directors who are going downhill. From Kevin Smith's Cop Out last week, the good directors making bad movies continues with Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland. Based on the book by Lewis Carroll, the film is too long, too boring, and too bland. From the little known short film Frankenweenie to Beetlejuice to Edward Scissorhands, Burton has shown us what an amazing talent he is. Unfortunately, his adaptation of Alice In Wonderland is just plain bad. Burton is such a good director, it's disappointing that his direction is so bleak. For the first 30-45 minutes, the film is visually stunning, if not still a bad film. The film actually starts out as a really great period piece, but that doesn't last for more than 10 minutes. Then the film goes into a fantasy that is nowhere close to fantastic. It feels like it's just piling anything that could use special effects. Johnny Depp is a great actor, and he's good here but this feels like his same character named Edward Scissorhands, and it feels like Depp should of had his character in that movie. Helena Bonham Carter is the only good thing in the film. She is fantastic as the evil Red Queen. Anne Hathaway is gorgeous, as always, and although she is a great actress she brings nothing to the table as the nice White Queen. The Red Queen-White Queen plot plays out like a really bad version of The Wizard Of Oz. Mia Wasikowska is alright as Alice, but isn't really anything great. An unrecognizable Crispin Glover is alright as the evil Stayne, Boyfriend of The Red Queen. Overall, the film is terrible, and you should do nothing but avoid it.",2,40,73,5 March 2010
Invictus," Great performances, but keep your remote in hand
","Invictus is a film with great performances by Matt Damon & Morgan Freeman, but the film should be watched at home with remote in hand. Although this is no way to watch a movie, Invictus is one where you can fast forward through a lot of it. It is sometimes vague and boring, but mostly it is an inspirational, and entertaining sports film. The remote should be in hand, though because at 2 hours and 15 minutes, it drags too long, and the boring and vague parts should be skipped through. The film is directed by Clint Eastwood, who always finds a way to tell a good story. The film is about Nelson Mandala, played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman. Freeman, a great actor all his own, is a friend of Mandala's which might of given him some strength. That said, Freeman could give a great performance whether he knows his character or not. Matt Damon is also good as Francois Pienaar, the captain of the South Africa rugby team. The film, for teenagers will be more like an educational video rather than a film, but as a college and/or high school graduate, see Invictus at home so you can skip through the 10 or 15 minutes of vague and boring moments.",6,2,5,29 December 2009
Up," Nothing short of perfect
","Up is one those rare family films that completely speaks to both kids and adults. It is funny and touching with jokes and sweet moments that both kids and adults will love. This is the story of Carl Fredricksen (voice of Ed Asner), who tied a 1,000 balloons to his house when his wife, Ellie dies. There's even a nice montage at the beginning of the movie about Carl's life, and how his life went downhill after his wife died. Now he lives in a house surrounded by construction, and one day, when a man is tearing down his mailbox, Carl attacks the man. So, when he is forced to go to a retirement home, he instead puts the balloons to the test. He soon takes in a boy scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai) when he finds him on the porch. Yes, this isn't realistic at all. There is no way a man can make a house fly, but it's by far Pixar's best film so far. The subplot involving Carl's hero, Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) trying to take Carl down is also interesting. This is probably the best family film ever made, and it nicely teaches difficult subjects like death and aging to a way that can speak to both kids and adults.",10,0,3,13 August 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," A visual masterpiece as well as a great film all around
","How To Train Your Dragon is the incredibly told story of Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), a boy who lives in a world of vikings even though he himself does not want to be a viking. He one day finds a dragon named Toothless and realizes that dragons have been falsely accused of being monsters. The film's visuals begin to pick up from then on. The dragons are beautifully drawn, the characters are beautifully drawn, and the land is even beautifully drawn. The director's atmospheric film making adds to the fun as the director paints an accurate picture of what Hiccup's world would look like. Also, when it comes to voice acting, this is the film to go to. Baruchel's nasally, wimpy voice adds to his character. This can also be said about the voices of TJ Miller, Kristen Wiig, Gerald Butler, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, America Ferrera, and Craig Ferguson. For anyone searching for a good time, How To Train Your Dragon is for you. Also, for anyone looking for the reason of why we go to the movies, this film is also for you. This is the perfect film for parents to take their kids to, because both the parents and kids alike will thoroughly enjoy the film, like I did.",9,2,5,31 March 2010
Departures," Definitely deserved the Oscar
","Departures, as you know, is the drama that surprisingly won the Oscar for best foreign picture. Me, having no idea what it was, went to see it since I was interested in it after it won the Oscar. I am happy to inform you that even with some of the other great foreign films from 2008, Departures definitely deserved the Oscar more than any of these other films. I'm not saying these other films are bad, I'm saying they're nothing compared to Departures. Masahiro Motoki is excellent as Daigo Kobayashi, an ex-violinist, who accidentally works at a funeral home. The film has a great mix of humor and heart. Daigo is a man we feel for, having to deal with death everyday, it must be hard, and there are some very funny moments, such as when the runner of the funeral home knows Daigo is inexperienced, but hires him anyway. I didn't go into the theater with very high expectations. Sure, it won the Oscar, but I never heard of it, but the film was excellent, poignant with great storytelling. If this didn't win the Oscar, and I saw it, it would of been ever more of a surprise than this winning the Oscar at the time.",10,3,5,13 August 2009
Pulp Fiction," The greatest thing a human has ever done
","Pulp Fiction is a movie that works perfectly as a comedy, a crime movie, a thriller, a drama, a romance, an action film, and a mystery all mashed into one. It's four connecting tales of a hit-man named Vincent (John Travolta), a gangster's wife named Mia (Uma Thurman), a boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis), a man named Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and diner bandits named Lance and Jody (Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette). It connects perfectly, Vincent falls for Mia, Butch knows Vincent, and Jules, Lance, and Jody- well see the end for yourself. The movie is a masterpiece, only a genius can think of this stuff. This movie is violent, brutal, sickening, and I love it. In fact, I can't see how anyone can hate this. Never has a movie been so perfectly done. Never has someone done such flawless work. It manages to be a great crime movie that is also funny and poignant (yes, it's extremely poignant). The movie has great potential, and uses it to its fullest extent. It's such a good movie, it's almost mind blowing how good it is. A movie of this caliber can only be summed up in four words: best movie ever made.",10,0,1,18 August 2009
Zombieland," Quite possibly better than Shaun Of The Dead
","Coming out the horror-comedy Zombieland, I was surprised how much I liked it. I was personally getting a little tired of zombie films, but then Zombieland made me want to see ever more zombie films. It is a funny, original, cool film with a lot of awesome zombie killing. The film stars Jesse Eisenberg, who you may know from such films as Adventureland, Roger Dodger, and The Squid And The Whale. He plays Columbus, a boy who survived becoming a zombie because of his long list of rules. He figures he's the only non-zombie left, until he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a man who doesn't have any rules. Tallahassee also is dying for a Twinkie. Watching Eisenberg and Harrelson make sparks off each other's characters is great fun, even more so that their characters are different in every way imaginable. Tallahasse and Columbus soon meet Wichita and Little Rock (Emma Stone and Abagail Breslin) in a very, very, very funny scene. They are two more non-zombies. Mike White is hilarious in a 5 minute role as a gas station clerk that they show as a couple of examples before becoming a zombie, and Bill Murray makes a hilarious cameo. White and Murray alone make Zombieland worth seeing, but there's about 500 more things to love about Zombieland. This is a very, very, very highly recommended film in my opinion.",10,1,4,9 November 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," It's Optimus VS. Deciptacon in a crazy fun sequel
","In the fun sequel to the 2007 mega-billion dollar hit, Transformers, Shia Labeouf returns as Sam Witicky. This time Sam is going to college only to realize Deciptacon is mad about what happened, and wants revenge. Megan Fox returns as his motor-cycling riding girlfriend Mikaela. She helps him stop Deciptacon. This time, though, there are two new characters, Leo (Ramon Rodriguez), Sam's college dorm mate forced to help them fight Deciptacon, and Agent Simmons, A.K.A. Robo Warrior (John Turturro), an expert who helps them fight the battle. The movie goes between hysterical cut-aways from the battle, and spectacular battle scenes. It does lose focus at points, but who cares for an action film? This is a real treat, especially for fans of the first one, like myself. It is fun, however, it is kind of uneven, and it is too long. That said, if you want to have fun at the movies, go no further than seeing this. I'm a little skeptical in certain areas, but I still loved it.",1,1,5,25 June 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Great performances from Downey, Jr and Law
","Sherlock Holmes is a new twist on an old classic, and before I further write my review, I want to make something clear. The thing I want to get clear is that this is not supposed to be anything like the old Basil Rathbone version, but a modern day version of Sherlock Holmes. If you do not like the idea of a modern day version of Sherlock Holmes, then don't see this movie. That said, if you do have even the slightest doubt that this could be good, go see it. The film is cool looking and entertaining. Since the movie is so good, I will mention the only flaw. The flaw is that Guy Ritchie, such a good director when he did Snatch, Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels, Revolver, and RocknRolla made the movie a little too frantic and in your face at times. The movie is so entertaining and involving that at most times, that doesn't matter. There are only a few times that got me uninvolved for that reason. Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law both give great performances here, mixing humor and toughness nicely. Rachel McAdams plays Holmes' long-time friend Irene Adler. McAdams is good, as is Mark Strong as the bad guy Lord Blackwood. The film has a great look, and all in all the performances are strong. The film is at times confusing, which is not a bad thing per say, but it all wraps up in the end. The film is ultimately entertaining and definitely worth seeing.",8,1,2,7 January 2010
The Blind Side," Totally uninvolving
","I may sound like a loner, but going into the new drama The Blind Side, I had no idea who Michael Oher was. That's why I did not know what to expect. It was an overused premise, but the trailers looked kind of promise. Unfortunately, the film is an uninvolving, soggy mess from start to finish. The main problem is that they did not focus on the character of Michael Oher (played by Quinton Aaron, who's good in the little screen time he gets.) Instead, they focus on the character of Leigh Anne Tuohy (played by Sandra Bullock, who's annoying in the ludicrous amount of screen time she gets.) The film felt like it was a good star vehicle for Sandra Bullock, but they're dead wrong. The film should of been the Michael Oher story, not the Leigh Anne Tuohy story. The film also feels too old-fashioned for its own good. It feels like I was watching stock footage from the 1930s. The cast, besides Aaron, doesn't feel like they're trying at all. The character of S.J., the son of Leigh Anne and new found friend of Michael is a good character, but newcomer Jae Head who plays him feels like he knows he's in a bad movie, so he stopped trying. As for Tim McGraw and Lily Collins as Leanne's husband and daughter Sean and Collins, they're both seemingly talented people stuck in lame roles in a lame movie. On second thought, that's everyone in the movie.",3,12,25,20 December 2009
Despicable Me," Mediocre
","Despicable Me is a film that is aimed for kids under 10, and indeed gets there. Unfortunately, it only gets there. If you're over 10, then you won't be into it. There's just too many fart and booger jokes and not enough sophisticated humor for adults or even teenagers like myself. Sure, I laughed once or twice and felt some emotion once or twice but you can't depend on one or two laughs and one or two emotional scenes to sustain a whole movie, especially at $10 a ticket. Steve Carrell's funny voice got annoying after a while, but the minions are funny. I mean this film had a lot of potential. This could have been something bloody brilliant and just plain great, but there's simply not enough of that here. The little girls are somewhat of an annoyance and get in the middle of an interesting story of a super villain. The characters are (mostly) 1-Dimensional and rather than not trying enough like most movies, this movie tries too hard and ends up stuffing too much into its own film and becomes the victim of its own clever game. Overall, I can't recommend Despicable Me, it's too overstuffed and boring. There are better kids movies out there for your kids to see, so skip this one and go see Toy Story 3 again.",5,10,24,10 July 2010
Toy Story 3," A perfect end to a perfect trilogy
","It's very hard to keep a trilogy good for all three movies, or hell, damn near flawless for all three movies. That said, all 3 Toy Story films have been damn near flawless, and the third might even emerge as the best. In Toy Story 3, Andy's going to college, and he has to decide what to take to college, throw away, and put in the attic. Something goes wrong when Buzz, Woody, and all their toy friends get donated to Sunnyside Day Care Center. The day care center is run by Lotso (voice of Ned Beatty), a seemingly nice teddy bear with some evil plans. This Toy Story has everything you would want in a summer blockbuster-action, laughs, thrills, drama, and even moments where if you don't cry, you truly do not have a soul. I enjoyed the addition of Ken (voice of Michael Keaton) and his love for Barbie as well. All the voice actors do amazing jobs. The first 2 Toy Story films were flawless, and this still manages to out beat them. There's a kind of sweetness to all these films that make it so that both kids and adults can enjoy them. Even if you don't have kids, you still need to see Toy Story 3 because it is simply put it, by far the best film of the year so far.",10,4,7,23 June 2010
Fantastic Mr. Fox," An amazing filmmaker-a big disappointment
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book. Wes Anderson directs, and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film. While I respect what Anderson, an incredibly talented man did, the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit. Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man, and if this happened to be a bad film, it would be his first bad film. Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day in film making, so I am going to let him off easy. I will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it, and the animation is nice, but the film gets progressively harder to get into, leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening. The characters are good, also. Jason Schwartzman voices Mr. Fox (George Clooney)'s smart ass son, Ash, and especially engaging. The film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness, but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along. I'm sure Wes Anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film, but for now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this film of yours was a big disappointment.",4,1,14,5 December 2009
50_50," Definitely not a split decision on 50/50
","50/50 is a comedy about cancer. Yes, now breathe that in for a second. It has Seth Rogen, an actor mostly known for playing a wacky party dude (as he does in this film) and it's supposed to make you laugh. 50/50 is also, by every stretch of my imagination, a masterpiece. It is a film with everything right about it and nothing wrong about. The person with cancer is not Kyle (Rogen), the wacky party dude, but his friend, Adam (Joseph Gordon Levitt), a man who has done nothing in life to provoke cancer, but somehow gets a rare type of it. Levitt puts a lot of charisma into his role, and Rogen is flat out hilarious. Adam soon visits a therapist named Katherine (Anna Kendrick) who is not very experienced in the world of therapy, and the audience questions if she's a good match for him. Now, you may be asking yourself..what's so funny about cancer? The answer is nothing, but the way the characters react to cancer in 50/50 and the way that they learn to cope with it is both laugh out loud funny and touching. 50/50 is incredibly acted as well..everyone puts their all into their roles. 50/50 is not a cringe- inducing mockery of cancer like it could of potentially been, but is instead a comedy that makes my list of the best films of 2011 so far, and it may even be on the top.",Null,0,1,8 October 2011
Get Him to the Greek," A rocking musical satire
","In Get Him To The Greek, Jonah Hill plays Aaron, an assistant for record producer Sergio (Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs). When Aaron is sent to pick up Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), a washed out, alcoholic rock star who is performing at a theater in California, Aaron figures out it's not as easy as it appear. The film then goes into a raunchy but hilarious film that makes my list as one of the funniest films thus far this year. Jonah Hill has learned to become a good, funny actor without being consistently wacky, and Brand is also very funny, and as a former alcoholic, very authentic in his performance. The real scenery chewer, though, is Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs who had me falling out of my seat with laughter every time he came on screen. He was a fresh idea rolled up in a very funny character. I also liked the music. Yes, Brand's Snow is supposed to be making fun of the rock music world, but his voice and the execution make his music surprisingly good. The one complaint I did have is the last 20 minutes or so, which goes on for way too long and gets too sappy. I think they really wanted to make their point but they tried to make it too hard. That said, Get Him To The Greek is a funny, well made raunchfest that also has a heart and soul to it.",8,1,4,6 June 2010

","When Friday The 13th hit part 5, everyone had one word in mind-pathetic. When Saw hit part 5, only their most loyal fans stayed around. By the time Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (part 5 of the series) came out, everyone was booing. Now, you may ask yourself, what's the point of this little rant? Well, the point is that it's hard to keep a movie going with 4, or hell, even 3 sequels (just look at Scream 4.) That being said, Fast Five is the best in the series. Vin Diese, returns as Dominic, who escaped from jail and is sentenced at the beginning to more jail time. He promptly escapes and teams together a group of cons, thieves, and most importantly, car drivers for one last mission. Also returning are brother and sister Brian and Mia (Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster). All the veterans are really good, and Ludicrous is very funny as Tej, a newcomer who helps the guys out on their last mission, but the scene stealer here is Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as Luke Hobbs, a cop who always gets his man. He's simultaneously funny and intense, and when him and Diesel throw down, everyone in the theater will be cheering. Fast Five is an exciting mix of action, comedy, and even a bit of drama. See Fast Five on the biggest, loudest, screen possible. It's the start of the summer movie season, and it's looking pretty solid.",9,2,3,17 May 2011
The Ugly Truth," Finally, a fun and raunchy romantic comedy that speaks to both men and women
","Everyone knows romantic comedies aren't the smartest movies out there. In fact, I find romantic comedies to be pretty lame 90% of the time. This is why I am happy to inform the new romantic comedy, The Ugly Truth is no 500 Days Of Summer, but it is fun and raunchy. It is not smart, but it is thoroughly enjoyable. It is not perfect, but I had a good time. The movie stars Katherine Heigl as Abby, a TV-news producer who has some trouble with men. Enter Mike Chadway (Gerald Butler), a dirty, scheming, degrading-to-woman TV show host of a local access show called The Ugly Truth who's hired to Abby's TV station much to her disgust. Abby meets a nice, handsome surgeon named Colin (Eric Winter, who you might know from Days Of Our Lives and Brothers And Sisters.) Although Abby likes him, she doesn't know how to get him. Mike agrees to teach Abby how to flirt. Mike says if Abby can't get this guy by his methods, he'll quit. This is not your lame romantic comedy, but a funny and raunchy one. I will tell you now....these are the following appeals to guys and the following to women: guys- it's as raunchy as Old School or The Hangover...women- it's a sweet romantic comedy. Whether you're a man or a woman, see this one.",7,5,12,29 July 2009
Moon," Sam Rockwell is fantastic in an otherwise extremely boring movie
","I've always respected Sam Rockwell as an actor. This is why I went to see Moon, a drama/thriller set in space. I've got to admit, Sam Rockwell is fantastic in this, but I was thoroughly bored throughout this whole movie. It was like a really, really boring movie. It kept doing the same thing. We get it already- Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) finds a clone of himself, and immediately freaks out. It also hurts that someone as big as Kevin Spacey voices the robot, Gerty. They could of used anyone's voice for that, and to use someone as famous as Spacey makes it feel like the people making this film tried to hard to create a movie with an all-star cast. It's a one-man show from Rockwell, who delivers a great performance, but there is too much repetition and it is too boring. I was expecting to love it. I personally think Sam Rockwell is a great actor. When you look at other films like Choke, Joshua, and Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind, he is great in all off them, and he makes them great movies. I, now, am very sad to inform Moon doesn't live up to its premise.",3,13,36,3 August 2009
The Proposal," Entertaining, but not good
","This is yet another predictable romantic comedy. The only difference is that Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock make it tolerable, and even a little entertaining. Ryan Reynolds stars as Andrew Paxton, a servant to Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock). They hate each other. But when Margaret figures out she's being deported since she's not an American citizen she turns to Andrew. They say they are getting married. Andrew's Grandma Annie (Betty White, the best part of the film) is turning 90, so they go to Alaska, where Annie and Andrew's parents live. We then enter the cliché parents. Grace (Mary Steenburgen), his wacky mother, and Joe (Craig T. Nelson), his uptight dad. This is not very entertaining. The laughs mostly come from Ryan Reynolds' calm personality. He just has a way of making me entertained. There's also Oscar Nunez, who plays Oscar on TV's The Office, playing Ramone. He will remind you of an aspect of Local Hero. This is not a good movie, but it might just be worth renting just for the mild entertainment. On second thought, you can just skip it.",4,57,95,21 June 2009
Valkyrie," Quite possibly the most boring movie ever
","First off, I would like to say in the thriller, Valkyrie, Tom Cruise is the worst casting decision in years. He is laughably bad, and makes it so the film is simply not thrilling. Second off, this is so, so, so boring. The whole cast just stand there looking bored. I think I saw some of the cast members looking at their watches to see when they can go home so they don't have to be bored anymore. This is the story of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), a man determined on taking down Hitler. He has a trusty crew of army men by his side. As thrilling as this all sounds, it is extremely boring, and laughably bad. It's also extremely clichéd. Yet another Hitler's evil movie. We all know Hitler is evil, we don't need yet another movie to remind us of that. Tom Cruise should have been buried alive before taking this role, and yet, the one actor no one, and I mean no one takes seriously, they instead decide to cast as a man bent on taking down Hitler. This is not even mildly satisfying. There is nothing going on in here, it's just simply boring, nothing else.",1,13,30,14 August 2009
The Fighter," The Fighter serves as an entertaining, feel good film
","Every once in a while a movie comes along that exceeds my expectations so far my jaw actually drops. The Fighter is one of those films. I must say I am not a fan of boxing or any of the actors in this film except Amy Adams, but I loved this movie. The Fighter is the true story of Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg), a boxer who was taught everything by his younger brother Dicky (Christian Bale.) Now, I must point something out before you go see this film. What I must point out is that if you are grossed out by unnaturally skinny people, do not see this movie. Bale lost a ton of weight for his role and is now close to an anorexic's weight (just a couple more pounds to lose and he'll be there.) That being said, everyone, including Wahlberg, Bale, Adams, and Melissa Leo turn in excellent performances. The film's a bit slow at times, juggling the romance between Wahlberg and Adams and Wahlberg's boxing career quite heavy handedly. Most times heavy handedness would be a bad thing, but this time it's a good thing if, like myself, you don't mind it. This film is not for everybody, but if you like well made films and don't mind skinny people or a bit slow of a movie, then go see The Fighter because it will satisfy you.",9,0,2,23 December 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," Very good action-thriller
","In a world of films that are either too brutal or too special effects laden, it is nice to see a film like Law Abiding Citizen. It is not too brutal, and is only brutal in some parts, and that brutality works. The film starts out with two dangerous men with baseball bats breaking into a nice family's house and killing Clyde (Gerald Butler)'s family. Fast forward, and one of the men is out of jail, and Clyde is more than aware of that. After the trauma that Clyde experienced, he decides to kill the one who is set free. He tells his story to Nick (Jamie Foxx), a man who formally refused to do anything about the short sentence one of the brutal men got. Now Clyde is in prison, and is killing all the people who had to do with his arrest because he finds it unfair that he gets put away longer than one of the men who killed his family. The film all builds to a great climax, and it never skips a beat. From the first second to the last, Law Abiding Citizen is a very good and very tense action thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the acting is fantastic, too. I definitely urge you to see Law Abding Citizen ASAP.",9,2,5,9 November 2009
Up in the Air," Great movie, this calls Oscar
","Up In The Air is a funny and heartwarming tale of a man who's constantly traveling. That man is Ryan Bingham (George Clooney, in his most Oscar-Worthy performance since Michael Clayton). While traveling, he meets and falls for an attractive woman named Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Before I go on, I will mention to you every performance is excellent in it. I did this so I could clear that without having to type a lot more than I need to. Ryan's boss, Craig (Jason Bateman) assigns him with an assistant named Natalie (Anna Kendrick). Now I want to mention that Anna Kendrick is more cute and fun in it than she is incredible. This is not a bad thing, just that she has her own special kind of performance. The film is directed by Ivan Reitman, who surprised me with his two other surprisingly great films Thank You For Smoking and Juno. But this is by far the greatest film so far by Ivan Reitman, though. Ivan's dad is fellow director Jason Reitman, another great director. I sure hope Ivan will follow in his dad's footsteps, so I can see more great movies by him. This film screams Oscar, and I definitely recommend you see this film right away.",10,0,5,7 January 2010
Semi-Pro," Very, Very Funny WIll Ferrell Film
","If not a little disappointing, this is a very, very funny Will Ferrell movie. It contains a lot of good laughs.... although it is not as good as Will Ferrell films like Step Brothers, Old School, or Blades Of Glory. That said, I did laugh almost entirely throughout the movie. A couple of good co-stars such as David Koechner as the basketball commissioner, Woody Harrelson as the Flint Tropics' new coach, and Jackie Earl Haley as a man who makes a full-court shot, and wins $10,000, but still has not gotten it, among others make it well worth watching. It is very funny, with some good, funny slapstick, and dialogue make this good stuff no matter what.",9,1,1,17 May 2009
