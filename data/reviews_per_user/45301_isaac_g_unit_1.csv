Changeling," Wow
","Clint Eastwood strikes again!Well, this is an amazing compelling movie. A magnificent performance by Angelina Jolie and spectacular directing by the legend himself Clint Eastwood.It has a gripping story line and features an eray of the problems that we are facing today. The acting by all characters is top notch and with Angelina's acting you can't help but crave for more.The movie is well crafted and has a stable story line. It was touching, frustrating, thrilling, upsetting and had many other qualities to make this the perfect combination for a terrific movie. I was amazed on how detailed Eastwood went into the story and he delivered to me the best movie he has ever made.I won't go into to detail of the plot, but i recommend this to all movie lovers, anyone really. Everyone should have the right to see this, as it is one of the top 250 movies of all time and i can do nothing but agree.",Null,2,5,30 August 2010
