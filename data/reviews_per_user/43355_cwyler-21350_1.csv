Million Dollar Arm," Pretty Good
","I read through a few of the previous reviews and have to agree with some of them. While this movie is very predictable, a little slow and doesn't have very many funny parts, the acting is very good, the story is a good one. It throws in a success story and a love story, two out of three of my favorite things in a movie. It would have been great to see more funny parts in the movie, but it's not what it was all about. While I like the fact that they had a story about two boys they brought from India to be successful pitchers here in the U.S. it reminded me of businesses that continue to outsource to other countries because they don't want to pay for the people here. However kudos to the two boys from India that became a success (movie based on a true story).",6,0,0,25 December 2015
