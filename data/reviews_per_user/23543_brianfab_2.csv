The Blair Witch Project," ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN
","I watched the Blair Witch Project with a dozen other people, who also heard all the hype about this new horror flick and we were anticipating the big 'scary' moment(s) to come.  Guess what? It never came.  Although the premise of the film is interesting...the film NEVER (at any point--except maybe the last two seconds of the film) lives up to its potential (you end up wondering why this movie even cost $60,000 to make).  One needs to have a lot of unmotivated imagination (or be down right gullible) to find any part of this movie scary.  The film is mostly comprised of the three characters arguing and fighting (the girl is especially annoying), them running around at night screaming (as if that's supposed to scare the viewers), sticks hanging on the trees and gathered stones, and of course the grand finale which leaves the viewers numb with utter disappointment.  Again, the premise of the movie has (or had) a lot of potential but it nowhere near lives up to its hype...It is one of the most (if not the) boring movies I've ever seen and a total waste of time and money...Our group was so bored after watching the 'Project' that we ended up watching a video of the Matrix afterwards...A generous 1 (out of 10) for the Blair Witch Project",1,22,42,4 November 1999
The Princess Bride," This Movie Belongs on Top 250???
","I finally watched the movie because someone mentioned to me that it was her favorite movie of all time....Umm...You got to be kidding (especially for the reviewer, 'Mike,' who watches this movie every 3 weeks!??....)....Okay, Robin Wright is beautiful (and respectable as an actress as seen from her performance in 'Forrest Gump') and the movie has some funny one-liners here and there (nothing profoundly funny here though), but what's the fascination?The movie is basically a farce with a ridiculously simple plot, poor acting (I think the acting was supposed to add to the humor....okay wow), cheap senseless humor, and unbelievable special effects (uh, remember when the 'Zorro' fights the 'giant rats' that look exactly like short guys in a cheap rat suit?)....I guess that's supposed to be funny too....It is truly incredible to have people comment that this movie is one of the best movies ever made or that it's a great film...because it simply isn't. I can enjoy light comedies or fantasy movies from time to time, but it's not a good one even in that genre/category.  It is not an awful movie to watch and it might be enjoyable, I guess, for (up to) lower elementary kids, but it no where near lives up to its hype or the majority of the reviews seen here.  It is indeed a great insult to have a movie of this quality (I gave it a generous 4 out of 10) to have it ranked anywhere near movies such as 'The Matrix,' 'The Gladiator,' 'Se7en,' 'Amadeus,' 'American History X,' 'Glory,' and etc., etc., and etc.  Not worth a rental if you ask me (unless you're renting it for the kids), and definitely does not deserve to be in the Top 250!.",4,20,52,1 June 2001
