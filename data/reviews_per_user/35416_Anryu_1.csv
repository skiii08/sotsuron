The Blair Witch Project," This movie scared the crap out of me
","Never before in my life have I ever seen a movie that frightened me so much. Terrifyingly real, I felt my heart in my throat through the entire film, and then was too afraid to walk home after it.  If you have never been scared by a film before, this is the one to watch.  Just make sure you are with friends, and the lights are on when you go to bed.",10,1,2,11 May 1999
