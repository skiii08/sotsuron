The Blair Witch Project," boring until the last line of the movie
","After reading some of the other viewer comments I've come to discover that the majority of this movie was either greatly disliked or ravingly praised. I felt that the people who udderly hated this movie probably were the ones that lived for special computerized effects and fancy blood and guts dramatic slashing and slaughter; hacking and killing scenes. But at the same time I also sensed that the people who undergoes this movie and reviewed it with enormously great amount of satisfaction were the ones that were open minded and they were probably also the ones to comment the movie as a grand horror and thriller movie. Hence the way it was categorized. And the acting? well lets just say its no 'Casablanca' or 'Pulp Fiction' but it was mostly spontaneous reflects. And I sure it was not only obvious to me that the actors/actresses were never given a script to read from.
I found the 'Blair Witch Project' to be just a race through the woods. And one of the most realized point of this movie is the fact that one of the kids not only had camping experience, but hiking knowledge, map and compass understanding and skills as well. But under emotional and physical stress all those might have the chance to be forgotten. And still I feel that's a plot hole that should have been covered.my bottom line is: The 'Blair Witch Project' is probably tied neck to neck with 'American Beauty' as the most memorable movie of 1999. So therefore it definitely deserves as the very least to be seen just so you can say you viewed it.i gave this movie an 5/10 mainly based on the fact that it cheated people out of over 11 million dollars just in theatres when only about 60 thousand dollars were used at the expense of 'The Blair Witch Project'.Yes, I do recommend this movie, BUT at the same time , THANK YOU HOLLYWOOD!!!!",4,0,1,26 April 2000
Erin Brockovich," Robert's best ever
","wow!! after I saw 'Runaway Bride' I was very discouraged to see another one of Julia's cheap movies, but I just have to say that 'Erin Brockovich' just blew me away! I found myself laughing along with this extremely funny comedy. This was one of the fews movies that had that affect on me to the point where at the end of the two hours I glanced at my watched and was like 'wow! two hours already??' Roberts worked a lot with Albert Finney than that Richard what's his name!!summary: this is a great movie and a great laugh. I gave this movie a 8/10.",7,0,1,21 April 2000
Se7en," Se7en is one of the greatest if not THE GREATEST movie ever made
","To tell the you truth, the first time I saw Se7en I didn't like it much better than Silence of the Lambs Of which I dislike for its non-originality and intense exaggeration and for those of you who have seen Se7en you know Its totally original and thrilling until the last line of the movie, This brilliant movie is staring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as the detectives and (none other than the master of acting and talent) Kevin SpaceyIf what I've said doesn't make you just want to get up and go rent Se7en then watch it for yourself. you've got nothing else to do anyways your just surfing the net.But I bet you anything, that you will be back at IMDB writing terrific remarks about Se7en just as soon as you see it.PS. Get up and go rent Se7en now, if you don't John Doe might come looking for you and kill you for sloth!!",9,0,0,20 January 2000
12 Angry Men," should be titled 'one aggressive man and others'
","wow, this movie really gave me that 'Shawshank Redemption', intelligent dialogue,and not much physical moment feeling. This movie was great. It didn't need big expensive scenes or computerized takes, it was all in the talent and the moment. I do have to say that with all the high ratings I did kind of expect a surprising, slap in the face ending, but instead this movie came out as a 'Reservior Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' ending that just sort of hung there, but I suppose that's just one of its many significance that I have not yet realized. This movie contained some of the finest gathering of actings in the history of filmmaking. Even though this movie takes place mostly in one room, but the actors still were able to play the parts as if they lived it.in summary i give this movie a 8/10.and yet suppose I didn't see this movie.......................",Null,1,1,22 April 2000
X-Men," Nicely done!!
","Very intriguing special effects, destined to become the movie of 2000.X-Men, while entertaining and fun didn't live up to my expectations. Especially with the huge hypes. I looked forward to a movie that maybe scratched the subject of mutation a bit more and studied the elements of the characters' natures more expoundly. But, instead the movie was just a bunch of heros saving the day.
In spite of that small mishap this movie is still great fun!!!!Worth seeing at the very least.At present my vote stands at 7, but it may vary.",6,0,0,5 August 2000
Grease," SING ALONG!!
","This movie isn't a 'Casablanca' or a 'Gone With The Wind', but its still a excellent made movie about two people in love that I feel with be remember for a while. Before I saw this movie I really didn't give musicals a chance, but all through the movie I found myself singing along. And now I give musicals a second look before deciding if they're worthwhile or not.summary: I gave this movie a 7/10.conclusion:    GREASE IS THE WORD!!!!",Null,0,1,22 April 2000
Pulp Fiction," as bad as movies can get
","This Movie was just a mere way to earn a few bucks for no-good, useless, can't think of anything movie Producers. It was just one of those movies that use a lot of famous movie stars to maybe make the movie a bit better than it is, well at least you'll know there's no bad acting.  It sucked and made no sense what so-ever. what a waste of my 2 hours. thank you Hollywood!!",6,0,1,28 January 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," talk about deep!! (tiny spoiler)
","When it comes to analyzing the true meanings of movies I'm no expert, but this movie really gave me a feel of inner hope and confidence. I mean, put your self in Andy Dufresne's(Tim Robbins) position. If you were in prison for something that not only did you not do but was being accused of murdering someone that you loved and cared for. And you go to prison for what 30? 40 years? and day after day you dig and you dig and you dig, and with what?? a spoon!! I know I would have gone nuts by then. BUT Andy gave hope, and he also gave Red(Morgan Freeman) hope. And I think that was the main aspect of the whole movie. Which is, in no matter what type of circumstances there is always one Andy Dufresne giving hope. Go find yours!!!!I gave this movie a 8/10.",10,0,0,22 April 2000
Scream," WORST MOVIE EVER !! (tiny spoiler)
","When I first saw this movie, it was merely based on the recommendation of a friend stating that its was the best horror movie he had ever seen. Well, you can probably imagine my reaction when I saw it. I hated it, I think its just your average 'guy with a mask with no real motive going around framing and slashing people as they please'. This movie is all about blood and guts. It has no intelligent dialogue and all the filmmaker was aiming for was probably for the people who watched this to say 'oh my god'.
WELL, BOTTOM LINE IS: don't see this movie, I could sum it up in 2 words,...................EVERYONE DIESI gave this movie a 2/10",2,0,13,26 March 2000
The Sixth Sense," disappointing but still great fun
","'The Sixth Sense' was defiantly not the Scary Thriller that it was raved to be. It had its moments, 'sure', but I felt I was as a lot of moviegoers and critics said was at the edge of my seat. I felt I was at the edge of my seat waiting for the next event to happen. After my first viewing of 'The Sixth Sense' and its viewer's comments I suddenly realize indeed how many plot holes are planted in this otherwise great film. Summary: if I had not read other comments before voting and not have realized the many plot holes of this movie I would have given this movie a 8/10, but now that I have, I truly think this movie not only does not deserve the high ratings it receives. in conclusion I gave this movie a 6/10",6,0,0,21 April 2000
