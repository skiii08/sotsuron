Mission: Impossible III," Finally a Mission that Doesn't fall flat!
","After the very awful Mission Impossible in 1996 and then the sub standard Mission Impossible 2002 i believed that there would be forever a string of bad James Bond and Bourne Identity wannabe's starring Tom Cruise and the name Mission Impossible.Yet somehow Mission Impossible 3 has quickly proved that there is some life, a new and exciting one at that in this world of IMF (Impossible Mission Force) The film written by Robert Orci, Alex Kurtzman and J.J. Abrams who also directed bring a new flare to Etahn Hunt that we have not seen before.When we begin the film we see Hunt now much more of a family man and ready to commit to marriage, and yet the job quickly comes before it all when Billy Crudup's character asks Ethan to go and find and retrieve an IMF agent who has been captured by Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) Hunt accepts and with his old friend Luther (Ving Rhames) and two new recruits Maggie Q and Jonathon Rhys Meyers they set off to find the hostage.Que big explosions, guns fights and that certain look on Tom Cruises face and we have a big action piece, including a helicopter chase through a large field of wind turbines which results in the bad guys chopper quickly being brought down. However the hostage dies and now Hunt wants revenge, he wants Davian.The film moves with quite some pace and yet somehow still feels like a long film indeed, its quite amazing to think that this film is as long and how it moves so fast. The direction by J.J. Abrams is brilliant and gives something to what was already a tiered series after two films, he brings a certain something which ups just about everything in the film.Now the stand out performance in this film certainly has to be Hoffman who delivers a very evil performance, the best villain by far in this series and i wouldn't be surprised if the Bond guys look to him in the future! He is evil and so charming in the short amount of time he has on screen, he is truly brilliant! Cruise is also on top form giving his best performance as Hunt, he delivers something more this time around a much more caring Ethan Hunt something that was missing before. While Cruise delivers a wholly better performance its still somehow very difficult to watch him act, in places he seems to fall flat while in others he wins hands down, its a mixed bag with him.Action i hear you say? Well this film has plenty, the film is filled with big guns, big action and just everything big. There are a few big set pieces that literally make this film go with a bang. The entire Vatican sequence was simply amazing and really credible, the explosion on the bridge was fantastic and didn't seem to drag, and the building to building jump was jaw dropping. All the sequences have a certain something, they were certainly the most credible stuff the franchise has done and certainly make this film worth the watch to ask how in the hell did they do that? Abrams is a true master of what he does here, if this film is anything to go by then we have no fear about his future as a director. He shows a great vision as a director and a true artist and gives a visual flare missing from the previous missions.Overall this is a great film featuring some of the best stunts of the series, the best villain of the series, in fact best everything of the series. If you were somehow and god knows how impressed by any of the two previous installments then this film should flash Oscar in your eyes. Descent performances all around mean for a great popcorn film not seen in the cinemas or on screen for quite some time.This review will self destruct in five seconds....******* out of **********",7,2,3,18 November 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Good Open ended sequel!
","After watching the first film it was obvious to all that there just had to be a sequel following Captain Jack's adventures on the ocean and everybody expecting as good a ride as the first film. The film did deliver! Dead Mans Chest finds Captain Jack searching for Davey Jones chest which holds a mythical contents inside, but on Jacks trail is Will who must bring Jack back to port Royale so he and Elizabeth can avoid been hung by Lord Cuttler for helping Jack escape capture, but Will ends up helping Jack to find the chest but also finds a family member along the way! And with Davey Jones making sure Jack and Will have a hard time finding the chest, they certainly have their work cut out for them! Of course with the original film the star of the show is Johnny Depp who is cool, funny, and just great eye candy for the viewer and he didn't win the Oscar last time for his performance but he should win it this time because his performance is even better! And of course we can not forget Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly put in good performances as well but they are overshadowed somewhat by Captain Jack! While the film plays out we meet a few new characters, one of which is the villain of the piece, Davey Jones who is half man, half every underwater creature you could imagine who is played by Bill Nighy. The great thing about the character is you really cant tell when it is Bill Nighy in makeup or when it is full CGI which is a massive achievement. We also catch up with Norrington who is no longer Comadore and is now a drunk who ends up joining Jacks motley crew to find the chest.Like its predecessor this film relies heavily on CGI, and with some films it just isn't convincing enough but this film is absolutely fantastic with the CGI and with the character of Davey Jones you really cant tell at points whether it is the actor in makeup or not, it really is that good! The action has really been bumped up with even more sword fights in the most unusual surroundings for example fighting in a large water wheel rolling down a hill and also fighting on the ruins of a church. The fights are good but it feels like they are carbon copies of fights we saw in the original and i really wanted something new.One of the best scenes has to be when the Kraken is summoned. By the way a Kraken is a giant sized octopus type of thing which is a weapon that Davey Jones uses a couple of times during the film and it really does gives some great action scenes.The direction is very strong as is the script and the characters and i hope that this will continue to the next film. The ending of this film will surprise you as you will meet a character you may not be expecting to wet our appetites for Pirates Of The Caribbean 3.Overall this films is about on the same level as the first but with some weak places within the film with the pacing being a little off but apart from that all thats left to say is bring on number 3! ******** out **********",8,2,5,6 July 2006
Armageddon," An okay action thriller !
",I have listened to people bash this film for a long time and if you are one of the people torn weather to see it or not then please read this before people put you off.I know that this films isn't brilliant and nor does it try to be but it does try to entertain (something that Deep Impact Didn't DO!)and in many ways succeeds especially by having Michael Clarke Duncan and Steve bucemi in it which give the film some of there funniest moments. the CGI is some of the best that i've seen for a long time and i wish that many others films would try to follow by this films example.The film does have it's bad sides but of course not as many as Deep Impact but we'll not go there shall we! one of the main downsides is that Michael bay and Ben affleck are attached which don't help credit the film and i think that many people will say this is why not to watch the film but if you look past this you have a good solid piece of entertainment that you'll probably grow to love and want to make a similar comment to mine.So all i say is don't believe every critic who talks about this film badly check it for yourself then and only then love it or hate it!!!!!,5,0,2,21 December 2004
X-Men: The Last Stand," This is definitely the end of the road for the X-men
","I went in to my theater anticipating a great film, and with this being the finale to the franchise expected it to top the previous two outings. I was mistaken! A cure has been found to cure the mutant gene and of course Magneto is having none of it and so he and the brotherhood of mutants decide to bring chaos to the people. Only the X-men stand in their way.The film visually looks the same as the previous two films, it also has similar characters to the original two films but the missing link here was Bryan Singers absence which pulls the film down slightly. Although Brett Ratner tries to bring us a good film he delivers something that feels rushed and quite out of time.The film has so many characters it is so hard to keep track of them all which makes the viewer care less and less about them which i think is wrong. Angel is in about three scenes what a waste of a great character who had some great potential in this film. Wolverene and Beast are easily the best performers of the piece, each delivering great comedic pieces as well as great action and drama pieces.Patrick Stewert is also on top of his game but again his character is cut down drastically something i did not like. Ian Mckellen gives another good performance as Magneto but the idea of him using the power to move metallic things is again something we've seen time and time again...lets do something new! The worst performance has to go to Vinnie Jones who plays Juggernaut which i had to compare to Bane from Batman & Robin because basically like Bane Juggernaught is put in there just because its a character that has not been seen on screen yet...utterly pointless! The film as i said looks similar to the previous two films which helps with the continuity and also gives great spectacle to the film as well.The direction in many parts is good but in others very weak. The film has been geared more towards putting an action film together more so than a film with a story and the action set around that like we have seen in the previous two films.Overall the film was good as it gave a good end finale to the franchise but i think this definitely should be the end after many characters are finished off in this film even ones you may not expect! ****** out of **********",6,0,1,25 June 2006
Scream 2," Scream 2 good but not good enough
","Recently channel four in the UK has been showing the Scream trilogy and after two years of not seeing the films it was nice to get to watch them again.Scream 2 picks up a few years after the events of Scream. Scream 2 tries to do what the original did which was to come up with a fantastic and shocking opening, now while i like the idea of the killer sat amongst people wearing the same outfit i did not think the opening was quite as good as the originals.The death scenes are a bit more gorier but very predictable. Something i don't always like in the script is that the killer always seems to fall down or seems to be clumsy, which is something i don't like because i think it becomes stupid and predictable.Kevin Williams script offers new characters, new settings but nothing much more than that. Having seen the first you know or you can best guess that there will be two killers, one you may probably expect the other was a shock for me but a super ending and a better one to what Williams had originally written.Wes Craven shows just why he's the master of suspense and horror by giving a good second helping of the Scream pie.Worth the watch but don't be surprised by the predictable deaths.",6,0,0,1 August 2005
Casino Royale," Bond Is Back With A Whole New Bang
","On the announcement of Daniel Craig on a rainy October day in 2005 i found myself thinking that Bond had surely just been flushed down the pan.Yet once the film began to roll in the theater today i sat there in amazement at how wrong the critics can be including myself. The stunning opening to the film in black and white will totally take you by surprise, with no gun barrel right after the company logos to assure us this is Bond you might believe you've walked into the wrong film, perhaps maybe a new Jason Bourne film but if you think that you'd be wrong. Oh by the way the gun barrel does appear and when it does you'll either love it or hate it.Then the main titles kick in with a super sounding Bond song by Chris Cornell which really hits home that this is a new Bond for a new generation and it makes no reservations about people in the audience taking this with them. The main titles themselves are stunning, not using the conventional topless women shaking their bodies in the shadows, but using a different configuration than us Bond fans are used to.So here we go we're into the film and we open in Madagascar where we get a fantastic and stunning sequence to which Bond chases a bomber round a construction yard, not just a round it but in it and on top of it and running and jumping about on cranes. I must say that this is a great sequence and don't be surprised if you can't take your eyes from the screen because it really is that good.So far so good but what about the new Bond i hear you cry, well this is certainly a Bond much more close to the novels and short stories that Fleming wrote and i certainly would say that Daniel Craig makes Bond a hard character again to compare him to any of the other Bonds you'd really have to put him next to Timothy Dalton who to this day i still believe gave such a great performance as Bond. A villain is so important and in this film he is extremely important as he is very central to the plot, but this isn't a villain out for world domination, this is a guy who's in trouble, you see he has lost a lot of money not belonging to him and needs to get it back and so sets up a poker game at Casino Royale. Mads Mikkelsen plays this villain with a certain quality you've never seen a villain with before, they even gave the guy asthma a villain with asthma? Crazy you might say but this is a villain that feels real eve with the eye that cries blood. I loved watching the character but i don't think he gets the total amount of screen time he deserves.Eva Green plays the Bond girl but not the one your used to. Here is a Bond girl with a little bit more sparkle a little more of everything than really any of the other Bond girls have ever had, she plays the character with much more depth and plays it to the maximum and gives a strong performance So on the whole this film is excellent and if not one of the great.Bonds and with this as a template i think further Bond films can be exciting and as big a spectacle as ever without the use of the typical Hollywood CGI and this is why in this reviewers opinion that Bond has lasted so long and done so well with every film so no more CGI just a good story and a good old piece of action! Speaking of story this is one of the best Bond scripts thats probably going to get a shot for the screen. Paul Haggis of 'Crash' fame brings his talented writing skills to those of ever fading Bond writer Neal Purvis and Robert Wade who wrote 2002's Die Another Day which is probably one of the worst Bond films to date. Here Haggis makes sure that this Bond film does not fall to the same fate offering snappy lines and the often quip we expect from Bond.Now on many peoples minds who have read the book or know of the famous torture scene then you will not be disappointed with it in this film. Daniel Craig plays the scene with so much force and even manages to give a little joke at the same time. Mad Mikkelesen is also brilliant in this scene as the desperate man doing whatever it takes to get what he wants, in this case money. It is just the stand out scene of the film! So what are the bad points of this film if any? Well the real problem which sounds really silly because its the main theme of the film but there are just too many minutes of film dedicated to the poker being played. As said this does sound like a really stupid complaint with the film but when watching the film or after viewing you may feel the same way.Now with Bond himself, i really have always thought that Daniel Craig was a poor choice for Bond and there were better candidates but i'm not going to just say Craig is a poor choice by going on a rant about how his hair is blonde and he has stand out blue eyes because those are just silly little things that many people are going to pick at so if you read that as a complaint to why Craig isn't Bond scrap the review straight away. This is a Bond film on the tops of its gameRoll on Bond 22!******** out of **********",8,1,3,19 November 2006
