The Blair Witch Project," IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET....
",If you have not seen this film yet please read as little as possible about it. Try not to hear other peoples opinions about it. The best way to see this film is to know as little  as possible about it. I'm sure anyone who has seen it would agree with me. The more I read the more is see that the people who didn't enjoy The Blair Witch Project as much as other people are the people who heard too much about it before viewing it.,10,1,2,10 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Get The Ending
",I can't say I fell into all of the hype surrounding this film because I was sucked into it as soon as I saw the ads on TV. So when i finely got to see the movie Saturday August 7  I had very high expectations. The theater was packed and bursting with nervous anticipation. I watched with hypnotic amazement and as the film came to it's chilling end I felt a feeling of relief mixed with disappointment. There were so many people expressing their thoughts on the ending at once I missed the horror of it. But as soon as someone next to be mentioned what the ending was about i realized just how terrifying it was. Until then I didn't think the film was frightening at all. That night when I got home the mental haunting began. I have not been able to get it out of my head for days now. I must go see it again. I do think that people need to be able to get the ending. I have read so many people think it is something it is not. Please if you have not seen the movie pay attention in the beginning of the movie and use your imagination. All in all I loved The Blair Witch Project. Thank you to the makers for giving us a fresh look at horror. It is truly brilliant. I hope to hear your thoughts.,10,1,2,9 August 1999
