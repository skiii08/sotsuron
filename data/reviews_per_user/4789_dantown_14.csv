Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," By God I Hate This Movie
","This hateful movie is called a satire.It seems to blame the Jews for every problem on earth.Strangely enough-so does President Ahmedinejad of Iran-blame the Jews for every single problem on earth.Sasha Cohen's 'satire'is equal to Ahmedinejad's 'valid Islamic truth'. I challenge any adult to view the abject barbarism practiced by Islamis in Iraq and then laugh about the 'cute' Jew-hatred exhibited in this film.Islamis butcher Islamis in Iraq. They -The Iraqis-call this religious freedom.Electric drills to the head are not my idea of freedom. Borat freely discusses his hatred of Jews and gypsies and the viewer goes along with his European/American travelogue.Hahaha. Sasha Cohen-the satirist-is laughing right along with us-at his 'brilliance'.He,Borat, becomes a sad and quote-lovable-unquote fish out of water.I am busting a gut over here.Sasha Cohen presents a complex movie,and I salute his intention.Ultimately- I hate Sasha Cohen.That said,this is a pretty good travel movie.A partially hateful fraud.Perhaps an acceptable documentary.It ultimately fails-although it is a valiant attempt at street-theater, with Cohen's inspired attempt to portray Borat's eastern European 'friendliness' on the streets and subways of urban, and paranoid New York City.",4,2,6,9 March 2007
Star Trek," Push restart button. Then,enjoy. This Trek will not be painful
","This is an elegant and action-filled restart of a 43-year-old TV series.It starts in the middle of battle and never lets off.I had to be dragged to this movie in a way. Yet once the lights went down and the explosions started (I'm a guy, forgive me Mother Theresa) I was hooked. We go back in time to Captain James T. Kirk 's troubled childhood,circa 2300-something A.D., through his near-dismissal from Star-fleet Academy. James was a ne'er-do-well on the farmlands of Iowa headed for a troubled life and the famous Captain Pike recruits him for the Star-fleet Academy. Although he's almost too screwed-up to attend such a disciplined place, James Kirk is there at 0800 hours after a long night of drinking and fighting in a dumpy bar, and gets on board,so to speak. The beauty of this script is the noble, strong and forceful presence of old-time Science Officer Mr. Spock, portrayed here as a young handsome and valiant man by Zachary Quinto. Spock is an instructor at The Academy who initiates disciplinary action against Cadet James Kirk for cheating on an essential,impossible exercise. The action goes to high-gear as the Academy's cadet corps are mobilized to fight an impossible foe with the Star-fleet Command. Through twists and turns now-Officer Kirk and Mr. Spock mobilize near-limitless inner resources and superior command-level skills to solve problem after problem with grace and courage that is charming and stunning.In sum, they're near super-heroes, in all their Technicolor glory.God, what a great story. This is a high-level re-vision of a tired workhorse series that is a gift to fans from whatever era of the franchise in Movies and TV.",9,6,14,10 May 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A Cold War allegory for children of all ages
","The despicable Russians turned a giant swath of this here earth into a squalid slum. They called it the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. How poetically tuneful. It was a daytime nightmare. It destroyed the life of Alexandr Solshenitsyn and killed the 40 million others who endured its sociopathy, and died. They died because the USSR was run by a psychopathic fraud, Joseph Stalin, who ran a psychotic government. It was a fraud. The 20th century was a disgrace which will live in the hearts of reasonable men as a great mistake. The little men and women, children of the blitzkrieg in London, faced a Leviathan of evil proportions: The Cold War. Into this scenario come the four children Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy, shipped off to rural England to escape the blitzkrieg of the Nazis- The Other Psychotic Dirtbags. Now, we begin. The cosseted innocents of the Blitzkrieg stumble into the New World Order of the icy thought-controlled world of Narnia. They are the descendants of Adam=Christians and Jews. The heroic struggle of the children and the animals of 'magic Narnia' 'thaws' the cold war, The Icy eternal winter of Narnia ends, and the new Jerusalem ensues. (Except for the Jews of course-since they are anathema.For some reason).Can't figure out why the Jews are treated so bad in this world.Too bad the Soviets didn't thaw out until 1989. Until their bankrupt economy gave out.",7,0,1,10 April 2006
Constantine," Keanu Reeves leaves the special yellow short-bus of acting
","This is an almost great movie. The world below versus the world above is always a good topic for a movie-if you do it right. Keanu Reeves has almost learned how to act. This is a good idea for a leading man. Keanu is a weathered and sickened extra-spiritual crime-fighter who can see through not only lousy alibis, not only through walls like superman, but can see through the impermeable walls between life and death-and between salvation and damnation. He is Superman times two. Imagine that. He is Superman with warts and all--spiritually. What a great fricken idea! A science fiction movie where all heaven and earth may be torn asunder. Your soul, dear viewer, is thrown onto-gambled- on the roulette wheel of all creation. There's a screenplay! Then there's Tilda Swinton-a miraculous actress-playing angel Gabriel-who tells Constantine: He's F***ked for all eternity! This is real solid journey into story-telling that transforms hell into Earth, and Earth into hell, and churns your stomach at every turn. Peter Stormare as The Devil is intensely vile. His performance is just stark-raving outstanding. All of this movie stretches your capacity to comprehend its sick intelligence and dire beauty. It is a descent into hell. You the viewer barely escape its awful world-view. It has a greatness, but an awful spiritual desolation. As I said: Tilda Swinton is a beautiful artist, as are all the actors in this sickly fascinating fable of spirit and damnation. It is a gigantic creation of weird reality which cannot be easily shaken off. I think Keanu Reeves has finally grown up as an actor. That is not a small thing.",6,1,4,28 August 2006
A Bridge Too Far," Not an anti-war movie-just a movie about the screw-ups in war
","A fairly balanced vision of war: advance,retreat,crushing losses and fantastic lucky breaks.A movie which holds up well after 30 years.The battle of Arnhem was a logistical nightmare. Operation Market Gardens was fought in the context of the powerful,daring and terminal assault on Nazi Germany: the June 6,1944 invasion of France, which adds to its irony.This movie is full of sorrow and stupidity and what seems to be a lot of tactical detail which makes it a thrilling work of film.I love this movie despite its minor flaws.The top leaders who engineered this fiasco were in love with a big idea.This movie explores the psychic flaws that led to a bunch of dead men and a whole lot of finger-pointing,and the ultimate feeling of regret felt by me, a viewer.James Caan is powerful as a veteran sergeant with a profound sense of duty to his senior officer. A young and handsome Anthony Hopkins is great as usual.Gene Hackman plays down to the level of his acting-competition as a terse Polish general who sees the flaws in the operation from the beginning.Hackman is better than this.In all, this is a thrilling and well-crafted war film.If you want to understand the war in Iraq, this might be a starting place:Bad Things just happen.",7,2,4,20 April 2007
Nacho Libre," A PG movie to love and suspect
","Jack Black is an annoying character.This is an annoying indie movie for 14 year olds.Do I have to write eight more lines?Ana de la Reguera is dang fine to look at,as a Mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of Jack Black.This movie is a PG 13 version of an indie film.I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture.This movie explores Mexican culture-deeply. I just choke on its cultural rudeness:Jack Black is just so rude. A white person like Jack Black is not my most valuable emissary into Mexican culture, as it were.Mexican Wrestling culture is not the most diaphanous venue a white guy, such as myself could seek.I suspect Mexico is more culturally opaque than Jack Black has presented here.I think IMDb changed my review.Has anyone else had his review changed as well?Just a question.",4,0,0,30 April 2007
The Aviator," A cowardly pioneer
","Howard Hughes was a tiny man in a gigantic world of Fascism, Hitlerism, and Stalinism. My friend Kim, in Salt Lake City, was dressed in his underwear, outside, by his mother, a Mormon. This was some kind of strange ritual, to me a Roman Catholic. It was a non-secret/secret. Adults have secrets. Mormonism is a big honking secret. His underwear and his mother dressing him in underwear were BIG secrets. It was weird. We Catholics in Salt Lake City had our own secrets. Open secrets in a Mormon world/state. I believe Howard Hughes may have grown up in a Mormon situation. Howard Hughes lived a full life and a crippled life which cannot be portrayed in film or text or any medium. Leonardo di Caprio did a great job portraying this sick person Hughes who had a fantastic life. His phobias were great secrets which needed a little open air to deflate their mythic power and thus be dis-armed. It was a sad thing that Hughes's phobias were not thrown asunder as his fantastic ideas were advanced. He deserved better. He deserved the love of Kate Hepburn, I suppose. She was a stellar gal. This is in sum a spectacular movie, which is as good as you could get considering this weird guy Hughes. This is a gigantic movie. Full of ideas. A spectacular gift from director Martin Scorcese.",7,1,5,26 August 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A brilliant spiritual existential movie
","This is a brilliant shocking movie. It speaks to your soul. It was designed to be so. The visual impact of this movie only underlines the spiritual import of it. For, every human being is a small unsubstantial waif in the large world-that is, us. This metaphorical movie reaches deep inside our souls. Each of us is a hobbit who traverses this life and wishes to kill evil. We fail, and succeed in steps. We may meet Cate Blanchett-types , or Liv Tyler-types, but we must pursue life and be good. We are titanically set up up for failure-if we do not pursue goodness. That is the message of this fine film. All of life is a great trial. An adventure. It is within our grasp to pursue it with glory.",9,2,3,18 March 2006
Cast Away," A thrilling though mainstream movie/infomercial
","Tom Hanks has a hell of a lot more talent than do I.He is not a cult member of Mormonism, since he only followed it in childhood. No,really. He is NOT a clone of the LDS church. Really. I really mean to assert that fact. He is in NO way an LDS operative in the film world. He just happened to stroll through the Mormon church, on his way to stardom. Let it be known that he has NO actual connection with the Mormon church. He is a quiet, less-demonstrative actor, who has a gift for understatement and beauty. Helen Hunt is a purely beautiful womanly woman. She gets to play The Girlfriend. Snore snore snore snore snore. Hanks embarks on an adventure that rips their beautiful high-toned suburban and corporate all-encompassing little capsular life into flotsam and jetsam, not necessarily in that order. Love rent asunder is always a Great Crime. I actually love the little infomercial for FedEx that permeates this movie, for I love the business of small business, grown into big business-the romance of it. Tom Hanks has two loves, Helen, and the quote-cult-unquote of FedEx. Hanks lives inside the huge global beautiful IDEA known as FedEx. I can so dig this feeling my brothers. A fake cult like Scientology just bleeds the life and time in your life-out of you. A business, like FedEx, like Branson's Virgin Enterprises, like Whole Foods, however, gives you life- as it actually PRODUCES something of value for the world. Apple Computers produces stuff people like-or so I am told. It is in some ways a 'cult'. That being said, Hanks is torn from these twin loves and somehow survives. He survives the loss yet is lost for all time, if not for a fortunate accident. His real loss is not fully realized until he returns to Earth (Tennessee), and then, is Cast Away. His life after all was just a roll of the die, cast.",5,1,3,27 March 2006
A Clockwork Orange," What is the point of this movie? Sedition
","This was a shocking movie 34 years ago. FYI-it's no longer 34 years ago. Just thought y'all should know that. The photography of this movie is absolutely excellent. This movie is a picaresque novel about one Alex the Droog. He is outside the Establishment and embroiled in the establishment-which spits him out its maw. It is supposed to cheer and encourage any young man to throw over the old farty bastards and establish a new order. And now we have the Clintons, and their hippie camp-followers . This was the movie which was supposed to set Malcolm McDowell's career on a high flight into the stratosphere. I find that a serious bad thing, because Malcolm didn't make it as a star. Malcolm is a genuine star, with acting qualities we all recognize. This movie really shocked me and caused mental damage-because I didn't have the mental discipline, or artistic maturity to absorb it. Oh well. I was a teenager and I will survive. This is a gigantically artistic movie for its time. It is elegant in its editing. It is powerful: The colors and angles and script and direction all coalesce into an intense anti-establishment statement which stand as art even today. It is a creature of 1972. It is not so bad, considering the year 1972.",6,3,5,11 September 2006
The Da Vinci Code," A pretty good thriller
","I just thumbed through Angels And Demons-a mass media paperback,written by Dan Brown.Only cursory-nothing specific.I find this writing hateful to my intellect and my own person.This book,Angels and Demons-is so stupid and hateful-to the quality of American society-that it is a book for retards-and not true men.Angels and Demons is a complete disgrace to human history,specifically-to the fine grand and powerful art of writing-going back to the great writers like Plato and Marcus Aurelius,and also to the fine writers of today,such as William Faulkner-amongst many others.It is writing for a ninth grader-disguised as adult popular fiction.It adds absolutely nothing to my great Western Culture.It disguises its fraud with esoteric references to the ancient history of the Catholic Church. The movie Da Vinci Code is more complicated.It spreads a hatred for the Opus Dei-literally-Work of God-movement-that-in actual fact-must be much more benign-and loving-than could be portrayed in a Mass-media paperback/movie.This being a dramatic movie-the evil albino Opus Dei follower-Silas- must of course, be psychotic.I say to you, my reader-this is artistic license.I say to you-Dear reader-that the pathetic Slander against Opus Dei is unfounded.For Christ's sake-Opus Dei is a bunch of Catholics-who wish to serve God.Catholics are Not Psychotic!I mean-C'mon!That being said, this is a thrilling and pretty plausible thriller-about: The End of Catholicism.That is to say-The Bitter End of The Catholic Church.Thom Robbins of course wrote the book,Another Roadside Attraction,about the end of Catholicism- a mere 37 years ago.In the end,Tom Hanks looks distracted.Audrey Tatou looks rather fetching.This is a thriller-let's move on to the next thing already.",4,0,2,10 May 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," The finest American movie ever made
","Jimmy Stewart doesn't merely act this role, as a sad, yet monumentally blessed man of the people. He almost SINGS it, due to his gift for vocal histrionics. This story of one man against the planetary tides of fate is an absolutely thrilling exposition of film excellence. Each centimeter of this movie is filled with Life. That is the sly double-meaning of this movie. I command you to find another movie its equal. This is a movie even the great philosopher Aristotle, and his Poetics, would love. All film-makers, and all film-lovers should fill their souls with this great achievement. It is the archetypal story of grandeur in plainness. But not too plain. It is a Deus Ex Machina, where a little itty bitty man, struggling against evil, is suddenly and magically healed, and yet, finds himself pushing the same rock up the same hill. The Gods have transformed his struggle into a spiritual triumph. Same Old Sisyphus, same old rock. This movie collapses and conflates a monumental struggle into a warm, and sappy and beautiful Christmas card. There will be a long time, if ever, that a movie ever accomplishes as much. I approach this movie the way a grasshopper appreciates a spider's web, once his leg is fatally caught. I cannot escape it. I marvel at the art it displays.",10,0,4,17 January 2006
A Beautiful Mind," Nash was in fact a Rambler and a Gremlin
","This is an unfaithful edit of my review of this pretty fine movie. by the staff at IMDb:Jennifer Connelly is a shocking and beautiful actress. When my atheist friends tell me ' There is no God', I say: How do you explain the existence of Jennifer Connelly then? That usually shuts them right up. Jennifer plays ' the wife of' gifted mathematician John Nash. That's it. That's her role here. Second Banana to Nash, so to speak. John Nash and his wife were both students at Princeton(MIT?) although his future wife wasn't as splashy as he. She wasn't a potted plant-is all I'm saying....Nash was a mathematician of excellence. He pushed the limit of his mind and lost. This movie is a tender-hearted and artful representation of his complex and doofy and gut-wrenching and important life. This game-theorist Nash didn't realize he played a game on himself. How ironic. The game of Insanity is just another game for people who don't know when to quit. Sanity is where you quit your (failed/lost)game of life and move on. End of Story.Insanity is -sometimes-where you ask yourself to be an Intellectual Giant- without mercy or reprieve- when you might be a pretty fine Intellectual Mighty Whale instead. Nash was a fine, flawed person who wished to be Einstein. He must have hated himself unmercifully for having not achieved that. Genetics may have pointed him towards shizophrenia- I'm not an expert on this. Losing a game of Chess can be very hard to take. Nash played 'Go' instead.I never learned how to lose at Chess. It makes you angry at the universe- if you take it too seriously. It feels like you are being humiliated by The Whole World. In reality, it's okay to fail at a game. John Nash forgot to throw the Monoply board over and start a new game. He killed his own life, by not allowing himself to quit the game:The life-game called Insanity. What a waste. In sum, this movie is good enough for Hollywood. It has a heart. I am glad I saw it. Please read the fine Sylvia Nasar book of the same title. It will thrill you and give you the background for this fairly good movie.",7,0,1,21 September 2006
Gladiator," better than a sharpshord in the neck-or whatever
","Russell Crowe is a pretty fine actor. He has the gift of acting on film: if that is a gift-he has it. He has the capacity to connect with the viewer. This movie is typical Roman schlock/ history =low-brow tastelessness. How do you correctly tell a story about the Roman dirtbags? Crowe portrays the General, Gluteus Maximus, who tries to help the Roman dirtbags protect their dirtbag empire. *** Not that I have anything against Roman dirtbag empires*** At any rate, General Maximus Gluteus (Russell Crowe) gets in a big-ass world of trouble because actor Richard Harris, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, likes Russell/Gluteus the Maximus MORE than he loves Marcus Aurelius's own son: Joaquin Phoenix(Commodus Toiletus). Richard Harris had a big-ass career hit 38 years ago with 'MacArthur Park'-A fine and touching pop song which featured Richard Harris singing this masculine song in a powerful way, but an ultimately painful chorus. It was true grandeur in the pop world of AM radio. It was a sexual and sensual coup d'etat for AM radio which cannot be forgotten.I move on. General Gluteus Maximus runs away from Joaquin Phoenix(son of emperor Aurelius), and meets cool people who are slaves 'n' stuff. This is the second-reel...where a hero suffers and becomes a better person and stuff. Russell Crowe-General Maximus- meets tall African beautiful people who are slaves but act noble. Then, breathlessly, the screenwriter draws us back to Rome, where the evil Roman dirtbags live. The People in the gladiator arena in Rome like the gladiator, Crowe/Maximus , because that is what People do, when they have to think about something. Russell Crowe does big things, being noble. I bet the black Africans taught him something about being noble- because they have fine black skin, or something. In truth, tall and fine Africans are fine and beautiful people. This movie exploits them because this is a stupid Hollywood movie. Maximus puts up with repeated nonsense. He finds a way to win. hooray. I think this movie won the Oscar for best gay hairstyle on a leading Australian heterosexual man: Russell Crowe. what an honor. I believe Russell Crowe deserves better than this silly-ass Roman epic. just my opinion. Russell Crowe is just better than this silly trash-but then-really-so am I. Sometimes movies are just commerce. I don't mean to shock y'all. This a beautiful movie-full of great war scenes, and honor and courage. It is also a sleazy Roman history. Roman history is a sleazy Machiavellian thing. Sorry.",6,0,1,18 September 2006
