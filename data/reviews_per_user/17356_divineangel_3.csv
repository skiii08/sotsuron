The Blair Witch Project," Great American Horror Film
","And my personal choice for scariest film of the past 20 years. I can see how some could be unafraid, but the subtltey and creativity of BWC cannot be denied. Marketing didn't make the film scary, the premise alone was enough. I was on that website for months before the film opened, and it scared me in my bright Austin office.We saw it at midnight on opening day at the Dobie theater, and I could hear people wonder aloud why they hadn't heard of this case before...Anyway, the film worked the audience over and later that night, unable to sleep, my girlfriend out of town, I had to relive the nightmare again...Watching over six years later, the film still chills and I feel a tinge of sadness that the amazing performances of the leads weren't rewarded with the actors getting more work. Heather Donahue in particular nails a rarely-seen character: the female film geek.There was something wonderful in the Austin Texas air during the summer of 1999...Josh!",10,2,5,8 June 2006
Spider-Man 2," An American Pop Movie Masterpiece
","While the first SPIDERMAN captured the comic's emotional angst, the effects and battles were lackluster. I also wasn't sure about Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. In fact, while a huge Sam Raimi fan, I avoided SP2 until last week.WOW.If I were a kid, SPIDERMAN 2 would be my STAR WARS. This film surpasses the first in almost every way. Raimi is fully in charge here, and the film plays like a Hollywood spectacle with flourishes of indie subversion, like the brilliant 'Raindrops Keep Fallin'' montage. On top of moving and entertaining scenes, SPIDERMAN 2 delivers the very best action superhero scenes set to celluloid. More important, the action is integral to the story and leads to further character development. Even during an epic train battle, the film swings from one of the best action set pieces since the truck chase in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK to a heart-tugging finale where Peter Parker realizes the power of his responsibility.Raimi so clearly 'gets' the source material that there is no better choice for director. Just check out the bank fight between Spidey and Doc Ock, one of the most perfect comic book action scenes ever. Even the quips work perfect. Tobey Maguire owns Peter Parker/Spiderman here and the film just wouldn't work if he wasn't able to generate such empathy, strength and confusion. Alfred Molina was inspired casting and ends up as the best super villain since General Zod in Superman 2. It takes a great actor to perfectly nail a line like 'Butterfingers.' This is Sam Raimi's best film, a complete summation of his kinetic film-making and generous heart (not to mention a classic Bruce Campbell moment). SPIDERMAN 2 is truly a film for all ages, minus the pious built-in studio morality. I can't think of another superhero film that brought tears to my more than once. It's the comic, stupid! And by the end of the film, after Parker has suffered the slings and arrows of misfortune, he is allowed a beautiful moment of respite and the film ends on a fantastic super high, capped by Danny Elfman's grand score (blowing away the weak first) and a wonderfully ambiguous final shot.I've been watching this film over and over the past week, and it's left me feeling giddy and hopeful, a charge I don't get too much from recent Hollywood films. But if Columbia was willing to give the director of EVIL DEAD 200 million dollars to make a superhero film...Go Spidey, go!",10,0,1,4 July 2006
Grindhouse," One Of The Greatest Movie Experiences...
","Go see GRINDHOUSE now.It will be one of the best times you'll have in the theater. PLANET TERROR is a blast, too long, but highly enjoyable for zombie fans. Terrific bits from Josh Brolin, To Savini and especially Jeff Fahey and Michael Biehn who get a chance to shine. Rose Mcgowan doesn't move me as an actress though she is hot. I dug Freddy Rodriguez as the diminutive action hero. Along with MACHETE, this is a perfect opening for GRINDHOUSE. The trailers are a highlight, with Rob Zombie's being one of the coolest ideas but under executed. Edgar Wright's DON'T is perfect, a distillation of British 70's fright films (not Argento as some have claimed). Eli Roth, who I find awful, has a winner with THANKSGIVING, a perfect recreation of a terrible barely released 80's horror video.After a fun food ad and those great title spots, we move onto DEATH PROOF. The movie starts just right with the awesome 'The Last Ride' song used in VILLAGE OF THE GIANTS over apropos 70's credits. Then we get to the female stars and DEATH PROOF grinds the house to a halt. It's QT's worst dialogue and most forced characters. Just because we get to listen to shallow women talk for 30 minutes does not endear them to us. This huge miscalculation kills DEATH PROOF for a chunk of it's running time.You're right to be bored by the interminable chat in DEATH PROOF -- the teen girls next to me loved it -- but there is a stupendous Kurt Russell performance buried there. He's reason enough to sit through GH. QT knows exactly how to write and direct a man like Russell, pity that he didn't stick with him. The dialogue between him and Mcgowan is good also.but then you know what happens and we're back with another set of irritating female characters. zoe bell is spunky and a player, but their sex talk is no substitute for empathy and the endless VANISHING POINT references are awful. Still, the car crashes and chases are great, not the greatest, but it's cool to see the real deal and not CG bullshit. Happily, DEATH PROOF does have a perfect ending.This is a special film that may be the last of its kind. It's certainly already a cult classic no matter what it's b.o. fate. If you can get into the spirit, GRINDHOUSE is an absolutely perfect recreation of a fun Saturday night double feature and easily one of the best times i've ever had in a theater...",8,2,7,10 April 2007
