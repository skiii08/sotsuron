The Finest Hours," Looking similar movies to Perfect Storm? Then this is the right choice!
","Yes. First thing first, like I said on the tittle, if you are looking good old and well made disaster movies, you WILL like this. Especially this one is almost 'identical' movie to Perfect Storm. Both tells the true story about accident on the sea.But about this movie. It is true story of oil tanker, SS Pendleton, which broke into half near of east-coast of USA. This accident happened in 1952, so the movie and milieu is just like that. Like you really can see that like cars and clothing really is old. The crew manage to keep half of the ship on surface and soon Coast Guards hears about the accident, they'll have to do what they have to do. The weather is worst possible but they will start the massive rescue operation with small crew - and with the small rescue boat.The storm and the filming in the sea is really well made. It looks real and you really can feel that you are also in the middle of the storm. Acting is also very good.There still was couple things that took away those 2 stars. And that was the woman, and such a cliché love story behind it. Well, this IS the production of Disney after all.. What can you expect.But if looking the big picture, this movie is totally worth of watching! It's really hard to say which one I would pick if I must choose between The Finest Hours and the Perfect Storm! I recommend both! These offers amazing experience of moments of disaster on the sea.",8,1,1,30 May 2017
The Maze Runner," This really was 'my dreams come true' -movie
","YES! This really was one of the best movies in this genre (for me) of all time! I really don't usually give high ratings for movies (especially not the best possible), but I MUST to give this movie. There really is everything I like!Let's gather all my favourite things about the movie: 1. Let's start here this is scifi movie. I like just particular type of scifi and it's hard to find. And this is one of them 2. Limited filming scene with limited actors 3. The maze itself. I LOVE mazes. They are just fascinating for me. And when the labyrinth changes every night, it's even better. 4. Plot does not fall flat as the movie goes on. It stays very interesting. 5. The idea to be trapped in somewhere where 'victims' must survive is my favourite type of genre. (Like Cube movies. I really don't care about the plot at all, when I'm watching that kind of movies.) 6. Adventurous and has cool technical creatures.And yeah. What more can I say. I also loved the acting, especially by main character. Many people says that it's not that great, but in my opinion it is. Everyone act their roles well.I really can't pick up the minuses. If I HAVE to say something, it was the ending. But it wasn't a big let down. Especially when I know that the sequel is coming so maybe everything comes clear in that film. So it doesn't lower the vote.I really enjoyed this one!",10,3,5,14 November 2015
Prisoners," 2:30 hours went in a flash
","Okay. Where to begin? Let's start with that this is one exciting kidnapping/detective movie, thats for sure. From the beginning to the end this was very interesting to watch. Not much boring situations or pointless filming. The atmosphere is nice, kind of dark, calm, but still dense and threatening. It's quite unique. Not too much actors or subplots.7 is still the highest rate I can give. There's still too many problems in the movie. The whole kidnapping thing does not make sense. And the movie leave behind couple questions. First: What the heck was the point of that other suspect, who committed suicide? And what about his mazes? Other irksome thing was the ending. What about the Dover? You just can't end the movie like that. It makes the whole movie pointless. And very sad. It's just wrong that father does everything to save her daughter, and eventually girl survives, but he still never see her again. This really wasn't truly happy ending. Although it's good that there are movies which doesn't have cliché ending. Still, it's quite sad.However, like I said, the movie itself was enjoyable to watch. Good acting and atmosphere. Interesting and deep. I really recommend to watch if you like detective stories.(PS. When I first saw the detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) I was wondering through the movie, where I have seen him before... Those corners of the mouth was so recognizable. And yes, he does EXCELLENT job in this movie! Very good actor. I couldn't remember it until now I watched the filmography after the movie. And yeah, it's known from the catastrophe movie, The Day After Tomorrow (Sam Hall), which is also great movie.)",7,1,2,2 January 2016
Into the Wild," Just pointless bullshit..
","This really was one of like 10 000 movies which I couldn't watch to the end. I just couldn't. It was so bad. No solid plot, nothing. I already wasted hour to watch this. And there was another 1,5 hours to go. NO thanks! If someone says that 'you can't review this because you didn't watch this entirely', that's bullshit. That doesn't erase that fact this was SO bad, POintless and BOring that I couldn't watch more. There was nothing that could keep me watching. I don't get it why this movie have such overrated score.This is just too profound and thoughtful to me and it's not entertaining or enjoyable. I really prefer even absurd and insane plots than not plot at all. I actually was thinking this would be another 'surviving' movie, where someone is trapped or lost in the wilderness or something like that. I didn't actually read any information about this. Just went with cover and title. I was hoping that this would be like '127 Hours' movie. That was actually awesome movie. This doesn't deserve to be watched 2 and half hours.",1,5,8,22 November 2015
3 Idiots," Now it's clear why this have such popularity
","I rarely watch this kind of movies. I mean 'real movie theater movies'. I usually watch low budget indie type mystery/scifi/horror movies, but this time I was looking some comedy to watch. And found this. And I'm very glad I did!Let's start with that fact this is comedy after all. It does this job very well. BUT, there is just A LOT more than that! This is clever, this is very, very emotional. Tears wasn't so far away to come for me. Really. I think I have never been so touched when watching a movie. And I'm not even very emotional person. (I think watching this alone with headphones contribute this fact.)Something also fascinates me about Indian culture also. I think the language is awesome! I have watched also the 'Slumdog Millionaire' movie and must say that these are only two movies from India, which I have seen and jeez! Very good movies coming from Bollywood.All actor AMAZED me! Not to mention Aamir Khan definitely the most! What a talent. Of course, excellent directing was also very important! Such a clever screenplay. And I have also used to watch movies less than 2 hours but these three hours went in a flash when watching this.It's wonderful how this was actually comedy, but was also so instructive and emotional at same time. Loved it. Great work Aamir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani!",10,7,12,27 November 2015
The Terminal," Very interesting movie. Turned up quite good!
","Yeah. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. Those were the reason why I picked this movie. And when I read about that this is real story, it's even better. It's awesome that Spielberg paid 250 000 dollars for the guy which this movie is based on. Cool. I have always liked this 'one filming location' -styled movies also. That's part of why I like Tom Hanks movies in generally. (Like in Cast Away, Green Mile, Forrest Gump) They don't have bunch of filming locations and are quite slow paced.But about the movie itself. Pros: It's good. I have ALWAYS loved Tom Hanks and it's definitely one of my favorite actors. Of course, it did good job in this movie. It's quite slow paced and funny occasionally. It was very enjoyable to watch. The story behind Viktor Navorski was intriguing.Cons: The thing that distracted me was how quickly he learned to speaking English. Okay, he was living 9 month total in the terminal but still.. Well, not a big minus. And the other thing was about that woman.. I really was hoping that woman chooses Viktor. Oh well, those 'little' cons take 2 star away but rest of the movie was very good. I think it deserves one star just because it's based on true story.(Ps. Sorry my bad englsih)",8,0,0,5 September 2016
The Cabin in the Woods," Quite interesting movie
","Okay, let's start with fact that I'm writing this review after couple weeks since I watched this so I can't tell very precisely the details.But yeah, I still remember the main things about the movie. The idea itself is just interesting. It's not that boring and plot goes on quite well.What I don't like, was the zombies and just too weird animal.. creatures.. monster things. That just went little bit too far for me.Also ending was.. Mm.. Quite odd.But yeah, generally this was OK movie. Like I said, I don't remember the details precisely, but it's still Average movie.",5,1,1,14 November 2015
Moon," Wonderful movie
","I try to keep this review short. So, what can I say about the movie. It's wonderful. It's clever. Well made. This sure is scifi and I haven't watched actually anything like this before. Especially it's amazing to watch this alone with headphones and dive into the silent space. Great atmosphere.Plot itself is quite confusing at first, but all come clear when you stay focused and just keep watching. It's truly quite impressive plot.And also both main actors did good job. And Gerty! I love that machine so much <3Truly great movie when you're watching it with right state of mind.",9,2,4,20 November 2015
Sully," Very good film, but I expected more.
","I've always been very interested about aviation accidents and I've watched pretty much EVERY episode of Air Crash Investigations -TV program. And there is one story which most of us recognize and / or remembers, including myself. Yes, this movie tells the very same story. About the emergency landing on freezing water with almost full passenger plane.When I first saw this movie, I was like 'Oh wow, there is actual movie out of it. It must be great.' And then I looked cast 'Oh my GOD, and my absolute favorite character (Tom Hanks) on the main role! Now I MUST watch it!'
And yeah I did that.It turned out to be pretty different than I expected. I was expecting more catastrophe film like The Perfect Storm' or Titanic or something like that.
To be honest, I didn't like those 'hallucinations' and different memories that pilot saw.
It's kind of weird that it shows the accident by piece by piece. But however, I understand it because this story was more on the pilot's side. I mean the investigation that focused on human errors. And it was great to see how they managed to fight back.
And here, Tom Hanks really nails it again. Just gotta love every role he acts. He just is excellent actor, no matter what role.In the end, movie still turned to be very great, although I didn't get quite what I expected.",7,1,1,20 August 2018
