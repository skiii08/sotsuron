The Rock," Many reasons not to see this one and only one to see it.
","The Rock is one of the worst and most annoying action movies I have ever seen. The characters are completely flat. Sean Connery clearly was not really interested in the project. Still, relying on his routine he easily outplays Nicholas Cage. If you like hyper nervous action movies, duologue's restricted to shouting 'Move, move, move!', don't bother about characters and wants your senses get overloaded, then this movie is for you. If you are not, then only one remarkable scene remains. Halfway the movie Sean Connery escapes to meet his daughter. Then it immediately becomes clear, that Connery is a good actor. Alas it only lasts five minutes. Because of him I reward a 2, otherwise it would have been a well-deserved 1.",2,1,5,26 November 2006
The Last Legion," Not fit for history lesson
","Generally speaking I dislike gore, superfluous sex (between the sheets) and am not especially fond of special effects. In my opinion it is a big plus, if a movie can do without these. At the other hand I enjoy sword and sable fighting - think of Erroll Flynn or the French musketeer movies. Finally the period of the late 5th century, with the fall of the Western Roman Empire, is highly fascinating.This movie is not an untold story. It is historically completely inaccurate, something like president Bush being in charge during the Vietnam war, with Franklin Delano Roosevelt being his political opponent. As examples I will only take two points. Odoaker took over power in 475, not in 460. Wulfila died around 383.Really, I like retelling or even reinventing legends. But I don't like utter nonsense. Clearly 6 years was not enough yet to write a decent script. Even then, if the story was told in an interesting way, the directing was skillful, I might have forgiven. But no. In the beginning ancient Rome was used as a background. It was unrealistic like cheap epic movies from the 50-s. Ben Hur got it much better. And the story? The director hardly takes time to show the emotional struggle of a young boy being the mightiest person in the world. It better could have left out. Now it is just one of the many scenes, which remain hanging in the air.Odysseus-6 is completely right about the actors, so I will not repeat it. I am sorry, several old sword and sandal Italian B-movies are better than this one. Every director degrading the highly talented and skilled John Hannah to a wooden amateur like this, should be put on a black list. One has to pay full attention, then one can pick a few moments, where the actors get the chance to act - for instance the scene, where Odoaker decides to keep the boy alive. I can imagine a savage barbarian behaving like that. Problem of course is, that the real Odoaker already had spend several years in Rome and was not a barbarian anymore .... He was quite a popular ruler in Italy, after almost 75 years of incompetent Caesars.I will just wait for someone filming Mary Stewart's Crystal Cave or a book of Rosemary Sutcliffe. These authors show, that historical drama can have roots in hard facts.Surinamese TV showed the movie at midnight, so alas I cannot ask my 12 years old son, if he was entertained. I was hardly.",3,31,59,3 June 2007
The Usual Suspects," Don't read Agatha Christie
","I have read many, many enthusiastic reviews. The movie is so complex. To understand the plot you have to see it at least three times. Etcetera, etcetera. Alas, already after 45 minutes I exactly knew how the movie would end and who Kayser Soze was. Probably I have read too many mystery crimes. You see, the very first one to use this idea was Agatha Christie back in 1926. Her novel 'Who killed Roger Ackroyd' caused a scandal in England. Her readers felt betrayed. The second one was a crime novel (forgotten the title and author) woven around the characters of Punch and Judy. Well, I did not feel betrayed while watching The usual suspects. I only felt a deja vu. So the tension completely fell away. Not much was left: decent, but not extraordinary acting, flat characters and artificial twists and turns. As the script remains ingenious of course and the direction skillful, 7 out of 10.",7,3,4,25 December 2006
