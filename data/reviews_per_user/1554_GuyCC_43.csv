The Blair Witch Project," More of a terror experience than a movie.
","Instead of giving a 'this movie is a must see, go see it now' kind of review, I'm just going to give a brief overview of what seeing this movie was like for me:The opening scenes and the first few days of their documentary: The filmmakers are typical 20-somethings.  'My friends and I act a lot like this', I thought to myself.  Right down to how I videotape everything and annoy my friends by doing so.  The search for Blair Witch landmarks had an 'everyday' feeling to any camping trip.The filmmakers get lost: I can't say I've ever been lost in the woods, but I could relate to the frustration of walking in circles trying to find a way out of a place.  The filmmakers' sarcasm and anger with each other seemed natural for the situation.The night incidents: Every night was worse than the one before, and the point where the filmmakers ran from the tent with Heather trying to understand what was out there was a tense moment.  I felt a very uneasy feeling during the scene because I couldn't see what was out there, but I knew something was.*SPOILER ALERT FOR THE NEXT PARAGRAPH*Josh disappears: When Heather and Mike wake up and see that Josh isn't there anymore, I knew that something happened, but what and when and how?  I couldn't tell.  That was the worst part of the situation.  The witch's 'gifts' about Josh's fate were unnerving.  Mike and Heather were now realizing that they were part of a game now and were being hunted down.
Heather's close-up: I understood with Heather's apology to the parents of three filmmakers that that she, as well as I, knew that their time was short and the game was almost over.  This is the shot that represents so much of the 'Blair Witch' images that you see, and is one of the most saddening moments because of its finality.The final scenes: I refuse to give anything away, but during those last few moments, I felt my heart start really pumping in my chest and chills go through my body.  I was open-mouthed with nervousness and shock until the credits rolled.  A powerful, terrifying ending scene.At home: After the movie, I went home.  I went outside to look for my dog. I have a small patch of wooded area in my backyard.  In calling my dog, and going into my backyard, my stomach knotted tightly with apprehension.  I almost left 'Sparky' outside.  It's only a movie, isn't it?This isn't a standard horror movie by any means.  There isn't a hockey-masked, knived hand lunatic waiting in the shadows, accompanied by scary music to build up to the moment.  This is the boogeyman.  This is the creature under your bed.  This is the campfire story.  This is the thing that goes bump in the night.  The creature is never seen, but imagination makes the creature more terrifying than any special effects person could generate. Forget practically every horror movie you've seen.  If you want to be scared on a pure primal level, see this.  This movie deserves every bit of recognition and credit it gets, and while I'm not looking forward to the countless string of rip-offs that with try to capitalize on its success (It happened to 'Scream'), this is the original, and this is the one to remember.  There's no climatic Hollywood showdown.  The trio finds themselves in something that is way over their heads, and the supernatural leads them to their fate.  Anyone who doesn't see this, is denying themselves an amazing film experience, but the reviews are true.  This is truly a frightening film.... but on a different kind of level.",8,0,0,4 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Well worth the wait, but not perfect.
","After 16 years, the wait is over.  Seeing a new Star Wars movie in theaters is nothing less than a 'magical' experience.  The overall story is excellent, leading up to the events of A New Hope with Palpatine's thirst for power shaping the events of things to come.  The main action sequences, such as the pod race and lightsaber duel, are fast-paced and exciting, maintaining the high consistency of thrills that the first three films pioneered.  Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn) and Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) add respectability to the film as the main Jedi, and the other supporting actors such as Pernilla August, Anthony Daniels, Ian McDiarmid, and Sam Jackson help round out the cast of quality actors.  John Williams' score is excellent, adding new themes to the classic score, yet keeping continuity in the music.  What didn't particularly appeal to me was the humor.  Jar-Jar ranged from tolerable to annoying, and a lot of the movie's humor seemed, at times (and pardon the pun), forced.  The classic movies relied more on subtle humor such as facial expressions, one-lines and movements, whereas this film had a string of poop and fart jokes on Tatooine.  For that matter, I winced when Jar Jar was kicked between the legs (and not because it looked painful, but because it was unnecessary).  My other problem is that the characters and dialogue sometimes took a backseat to the numerous special effects in the film, making it lose some of its emotional impact that the first films were so rich in.  To me, Star Wars, has always been about the characters, not the worlds they visit.  Despite these few problems, The Phantom Menace has been one of the more entertaining films I've seen in quite a while, and it only continues to fuel the Star Wars frenzy that will continue in the next two films.  This movie is only meant as a chapter in an epic.  It lays the groundwork for future events, and gives plenty of thrills along the way.  An enjoyable film.",6,0,1,24 June 1999
Casablanca," I Think Every Great Movie One-Liner Originated Here.
","As a film enthusiast, this is definitely one of the greatest films I've ever seen.  The 50 year-plus film has aged gracefully, and stays just as entertaining as the last time I watched it.I honestly can't say what I like the most about it: The cast, the dialogue, the humor, the story, the romance, the national pride....  There's not just one thing that's great about this movie; each part is so integral to this film that it would be impossible to imagine anything altered in the slightest.  This is the best film that I've seen Bogart in, and his sarcastic, no-nonsense attitude makes him the perfect 'anti-hero': A man who seems cynical to the world, yet risks it all to do what he believes is right.  This was a very 'noble' film in its principles.There are very few films that I'll give a '10' on the rating system.  This was a no-brainer for me.  This didn't just set the standards for future movies, this IS the movies.  My only regret is that it took me as long as it did to see it originally two years ago.  A perfect movie if one ever existed.",10,1,1,8 December 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Over the top profanity, but the message rings true.
","I knew South Park was going to have a lot of profanity in it even before I sat down to watch it, but it was simply amazing to hear how they managed to cram the 'F-word' into just one five minute segment.  Sure, the word and many, many others are found all throughout the rest of the film, but it's done in such a blatantly gleeful manner, that you can almost see Trey Parker and Matt Stone sitting back and laughing at the Motion Picture Association. So is the movie just about how far they can push the profanity barrier? No. It's actually entertaining as a musical, and has a message that, with the way things are happening in the news today, couldn't have come along at a better time.  Four potty-mouthed kids actually make a strong, sensible point.  Who knew?As for the rest of the movie, everything that could have a boundary to be crossed, from racism to homosexuality, is completely trampled on, making nothing safe or untouched.  This movie is very much an equal-opportunity offender.  The movie spoofs everything from Star Wars, anime, Tommy, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame, and the songs, although bizarre, are actually quite good.  My only complaint about the music is that Chef didn't have his own musical number.The movie also reveals some of the great South Park mysteries such as 'What does Kenny look like under his hood', and everyone cameos at some point or another.  The animation ranges from what you would find on the show to 'dramatic' cinematic camera angles.Overall, South Park is an enjoyable film, but is definitely rated 'R' for a reason.  I'm sure there will be a lot of groups saying that this movie is exactly why there are so many problems with society, but these are the same people who will never watch the film, and see that the film is poking fun at itself.  This movie delves into the surreal and is painfully funny at times. Think of this as the Monty Python of the '90's... minus the British accents, of course.",8,0,0,12 July 1999
The Mummy," I loved this movie, but I have no idea why.
","Before I give my comments on this movie, let me set the record straight on one thing. This movie is silly, far fetched, the special effects can be seen as just being that: special effects. For that matter, the plot isn't that entirely deep or perfect by any means. But I had a great time watching it. What I enjoyed the most about this movie are the one-liners. They were clever, well-timed, and quite a few of them had me laughing loudly in the theater. The acting was over-the-top, and had more of a comic book feel with its wise-cracking, overly 'dashing' hero, the damsel in continual distress and the weasly henchmen working to suit his best interests. This movie was filled with those kind of 'adventure movie' stereotypes, and instead of being disgusted by these cliches, I found that it made this movie all that more fun. Anyone going to see this film thinking that this movie is going to be serious or scary is going to be sorely disappointed. (That doesn't mean that little kids should see this movie. It's mildly gory in an 'Army of Darkness' sort of way.) However, people wanting to be amused by a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously will find the two hours enjoyable. I can't wait to see this on DVD.",7,0,0,11 June 1999
X-Men," Finally, A Marvel Comic-Movie Given Justice.
","Good comic movies are few and far between, and none of them have ever really been Marvel-based.  Sure, 'Blade' wasn't too bad, but it was nothing like the original 'Superman' or 'Batman' movies.Well, 'X-Men' has changed all that.I was excited about this movie, but not expecting too much. However, as I sat through the movie, I felt that goofy, fanboy smile creep across my face as I realized that this movie got the point what the X-Men were all about: Not a good mutant/bad mutant battle, but individual people and the prejudice mutants face.  Every doubt or concern about the director's previous lack of knowledge of the series or even casting choices for certain characters faded as I took everything in.  They got it all right.Hugh Jackman was a perfect Wolverine, as was Patrick Stewart for Professor X.  Actually, the entire cast really played their parts well, and seemed to understand their character's personalities.  Even the Cyclops/Jean Grey/Wolverine love triangle was added, as was the Cyclops/Wolverine rivalry.  Everything from Wolverine's 'bub', to cameos from Iceman, Jubilee and Shadowcat kept me satisfied.  I so wanted X-Men to be taken seriously, and it was, and finally, a new comic movie has finally been given respect. The special effects just added more to the overall excitement, and the plot and dialogue sounded like a comic book entry. (Take that last comment as 'authentic'.) I know they have sequels lined up for the future, and I pray that those new movies will be shown as much care as this one.  Still, this one is a fun ride, and it gives me hope that a Spider-Man movie might actually be decent after all.  I can't wait to get this one on DVD.",8,0,0,15 July 2000
Spider-Man 3," A Good Movie, But Slight Fraying Is Showing Around The Webbing.
","Spider-Man is a childhood hero of mine. I've enjoyed the comics over the years, and the second Spider-Man film is one of the greatest comic book to film movies ever made. From that standpoint, I review this as a fan, but as a film enthusiast as well.I was very excited about seeing the black costume and Venom, my personal favorite moments from the comics. Spider-Man 3 was enjoyable entertainment, and broke the 'curse' of 'Part 3' destroying a good comic movie series (Batman, Superman, X-Men). But this didn't overthrow Spider-Man 2 as the best. It could have, but some liberties taken with the film ultimately cost it.The story arcs for villains Sandman, Harry Osborn (I loathe the name 'New Goblin') and Venom were VERY accurate to their comic counterparts. If some of it seemed a little coincidental or contrived, in honesty, that's how the stories progressed over the years, especially for Harry and Venom. They took a few liberties with Sandman, but the saving grace is that they keep to the trend of not making the 'bad guys' one-dimensional villains.This film dealt with a LOT of plot threads. Venom should have been saved for a fourth film, as once he is 'created', he becomes underused, which is a shame for a major villain in the Spider-Man mythos. Truthfully, the film could have worked with or without Venom, who felt like an afterthought or 'fan service'. However, with 18,000 story lines running rampant in the movie, they somehow manage to keep it all together and pull it through to the end, while tying up the entire plot. That feat alone is impressive, so kudos to the Raimi's writing talents.*SPOILER* Still, it seemed that the only character that went anywhere by the end and actually moved forward was Harry Osborn. Peter and Mary Jane just didn't seem to end up anywhere new or different by the film's end, leaving them somewhat ambiguous. The same goes for Gwen Stacy. Another iconic character in the comics, but her status remains unknown.*/SPOILER* J.K. Simmons' role as J. Jonah Jameson and Bruce Campbell in his 'Where's Waldo: Spider-Man Movie Edition' appearances in the film are once again comedy gold.The real problem of the film lies in the black costume. The comic's concept holds true in the movies, but the added aspect the story gives it also introduces elements in the film that I thought was the worst moment of not only this film, but out of all three films as a whole.*SPOILER* Peter's need to comb over his hair 'emo' style whenever he suited up in the black costume: The 'emo' thing as a whole is irksome, but the movie makes it clear this is some conscious and deliberate decision on Peter's part. It's irritating that they would do this, however indirect the reference may have been. And all I could see was 'Emo Spider-Man'. Leave the fad sub-cultures out of films, please. Not just this film, but any film. It's silly to allow a comb over show that this is 'angry' Peter, like the audience couldn't figure it out.The second aspect of the film again related to the black costume. The costume isn't supposed to magnify emotions of the wearer. And when they gave that description in the dialogue, another comic-based film popped into my mind. And sure enough, Peter becomes a disco dancing, crotch thrusting show-off that that seemed to be a direct reference to Jim Carrey's 'The Mask'. If Peter has suddenly cried out 'Smokin'', I wouldn't have been surprised. In fact, I was just waiting for him to say it and get it over with. The scene certainly went on long enough, and outwore its welcome. This is the first and only moment of all three films that made me shake my head with disbelief and disappointment.The final contention point was like the second film, Spider-Man remained unmasked at any given opportunity. I'm sure this was due to making sure Tobey Maguire got some 'face' time, but Spider-Man (until recently) had a secret identity. It felt like he'd whip the mask off for no necessary reason at any given time. One starts to question why he even used a mask at all after a while.*/SPOILER* Another criticism is the 'New Goblin'. I never liked the original Green Goblin costume as it was far too 'Power Rangers' for its own good, and the biggest deviant of all the character's looks. New Goblin gives Harry an 'Extreme Snowboarder with an anger management problem' look that honestly, he could have called himself anything, and the audience would have never made the 'Goblin' connection.Despite some issues, Spider-Man 3 was a very good film. Not a great film, but it was a good closure to the unresolved plot threads of the first two films. And overall, the characters and their motivations remained intact. As a trilogy, the films hold up very well. Thankfully, the story didn't veer off in some alternate direction that seemed inconsistent with the first two films and left one scratching their head in confusion.That said, as much of a Spider-Man enthusiast as I am, I hope they don't push any farther with the series (though I'm sure they will). There are a lot of stories and villains they can cover, so the lack of source material is in no danger of being used up, but for the first time, I began to see the rough edges start to wear around the series. After the mess made with 'X-Men 3' (putting a real chink in the armor of that series), it's best to bow out now, and keep the dignity intact of this series. As I said, the movie held up, but it became apparent that it's not going to always be so lucky in the future.",7,3,4,5 May 2007
Sleepy Hollow," One of Burton's Finest Works
","The more I see it, the more I like it.'Sleepy Hollow' is one of the most visually beautiful (and bloodiest for Burton) films that I have seen this year.  It's dark, moody look almost seems like a black and white film that only has a few splashes (which in some ways, 'splashes' is very accurate) of color throughout.  Danny Elfman has provided yet another wonderful score, and sets the tone of the film perfectly.Without a doubt, Johnny Depp's performance makes the movie.  He's arrogant, eccentric, intelligent... and a bit cowardly and squeamish.  He's not the typical 'hero' that you find in so many films (although he does fall into the definition a few times), and his performance is both comical and memorable.  Great uses of humor through the film to counteract the scary scenes.A great cast rounds out this film with plenty of cameos from Burton's past films to his own personal favorites.  Initially, I wasn't sure what to think of Casper Van Dien, because every time I see him, all I think of is 'Starship Troopers'.  Regardless, he pulled off the character of Brom well.I liked the mystery of this.  A lot of reviews have criticized the story as being weak, but the mystery was large, and all of the loose ends were resolved.  It's actually pretty impressive despite the complex plot twists thrown about.Tim Burton's movies always have that ring of nostalgia or high camp.  The references to the Disney short were undeniable, as was the seeming 'bat wings' behind Christopher Lee.  Burton is so underappreciated as a director.This is an excellent 'Burton fan' film, or for anyone who likes a good horror story.  For Burton, it ranks up with my personal favorites such as 'Nightmare Before Christmas' or 'Edward Scissorhands'.",9,0,0,27 November 1999
Alien," Excellent Blend of Sci-Fi and Horror.
","'Alien' is by far one of my favorite science fiction series (And yes, I did like the third and forth installments even though I didn't feel they were as polished as the first two.)  The true test of a good movie is comparing how effective it was when it was first released to how it holds up today.  This is still a scary and claustrophobic mood-inducing film.The scenes that I feel best represent the frantic pace of this film are the introduction of the chestburster, the first real look at the alien, Ash's 'secret' revealed, and Ripley's escape from the Nostromo.  The movie is full of tense moments meant to make the viewer jump, whether it's the sense of impending doom for the hunted crew members, or some false lead used to make the viewer cringe before the alien attacks.  The fact that it's set inside a spaceship with simple designs and sterile white colors makes it all the more unnerving.What's to say about this film that hasn't already been said?  'Alien' hasn't lost any of it's fear appeal, and the alien design has always been excellent (Thank you, Giger).  It's a wonderful combination of horror and science fiction with an effective cast and a brilliant use of natural sounds throughout the ship.  I love a good musical score as much as the next film fan, but the raw silence of the ship only adds to the tension.  A great movie, and quite the change from the idealistic 'Star Wars' released only two years earlier.",9,1,2,7 March 2000
Lost in Translation," A Remarkable Film That Says A Lot.
","I enjoy Bill Murray's acting. Loved him in Ghostbusters, and thought his turn in Groundhog Day was a real growth of his acting skills. I never got around to seeing 'Lost in Translation' until recently, and after viewing it, I shouldn't have missed it the first time around.Not everyone is going to get this film. Starring Bill Murray, one might expect it to be a comedy or for him to pull some of his wacky, sarcastic hi-jinks. In the film, he's portrayed as bitter, weary and just very alone. It's not that his character (Bob) comes off as a jerk, it's more that his life has become mundane and uninspiring, and he's simply going through a routine with his marriage, his career, his life... knowing exactly what to expect. This is one of the deepest and most low-key performance yet from Murray.The same applies to the younger Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a wife who is also basically alone, even though her husband is more or less around, much like herself and her role in the marriage. Despite the age differences, Bob and Charlotte strike up a friendship, and give each other a chance to sample some living.It's not exactly a romantic film. There's an unspoken feeling of love or attraction, but it focuses more on the friendship aspect. The connection of having someone around who actually 'gets' the other, or at least makes an attempt to listen past previously deaf words. The film focuses a lot on the isolation and loneliness of the two characters at different stages in their lives, but each character seems to want more out of their daily routines, and can't seem to find it anywhere else than with each other. You feel for the two characters trying to maintain their roles versus trying to make themselves aware of their own lives again.Outside of the story, the movie has great cinematography and dialogue, both realistic and humorous. It's not a depressing twist on the 'mid-life crisis' fable. It just makes one think, especially for those who have felt like they've been in a rut themselves. It reminds that wanting to change a routine either takes a lot of work, or to simply try something different. And for those who need a tight sense of 'conclusion' at the end of a film, it's not going to be found here.*SPOILER* There are a lot of things that could be interpreted from the ending, but my own thoughts tell me the end is perhaps the most realistic scenario, albeit each having been changed for the better from the experience. *END SPOILER*I read a few of the negative reviews on here, and I don't understand how this film could be viewed as a waste of time. Maybe the story was too slow paced, or Bill Murray wasn't zany enough for them. Or it's possible that I found this film at a point in my life where I wanted to hear what it had to say, but this film is well worth the attention and awards it received, and in many respects, I can't even properly describe why this film stood out as much as it did. To watch it is to better understand.Recommended.",10,3,7,11 March 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better Than Episode I, But Still With Issues.
","Let's just cut to the chase as there are already several thousand reviews on this film, and certainly by now most people have seen this movie: Episode II is a much better film than 'The Phantom Menace' by reinserting more of the familiar elements from the beloved original trilogy.  That said, even with help, Lucas still needs to work on his dialogue and character direction.Make no doubt of it, Lucas is the consummate technology man.  His innovations in sound and video are nothing short of remarkable, and a lot of that is applied here.  And Lucas certainly listened more to his fans on this one by reducing the annoying Jar Jar Binks and giving him a reason for being there (and a real reason to dislike him in the interest of story purposes). More of the elements that made the originals so likeable were put in this film: bounty hunters, a larger role for C-3PO and R2-D2 (although Threepio utters some real 'groaner' puns), more lightsaber battles, some ship combat, monster fights....  And yes, these elements did pick up the pace from the last film and help a lot, but it still lacked something.  I think some of the elements were there to keep fans a little more satisfied this time around.Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan still is an excellent choice for the role. Natalie Portman, while beautiful, still looks uncomfortable in this film, as if she's not really sure of how to handle the character interaction or dialogue (which is unfortunate, because she really is a great actress).  And as a side note, the DVD version of the film removes the disbelief of her quick recovery of one of her falls later in the film.  Hayden Christensen is another actor who seems to be really uncomfortable with the dialogue (both he and Portman seem like they're about to choke on any romance related conversation, making the love affair seem less passionate and more confused).  However, in Christensen's defense, his speech after facing the Tusken Raiders is very effective and chilling for what the character of Anakin Skywalker needs to be.  The familiars from the original films do their jobs well, Temuera Morrison makes for a better Fett character, and Samuel L. Jackson is finally allowed to cut loose (and heads) in this film.By far, the best elements of this film are the final battle sequences, which is a true CG wonderland.  This is where Lucas excels, and it shows.  The pre-Clone War battles are heavy with action, and the Yoda battle seems to remain a fan favorite.Lucas needs to remain in charge of the visuals, and naturally, be the final say for how the story ends/begins.  However, although not likely, he needs to let someone else work on the dialogue (leaving Lucas for approval, but little else), and perhaps have someone on set to better work on directing the actors in terms of motivation and direction.  He has a truly great and talented cast, and they need to be used as such.  His work on 'American Graffiti' and the original 'Star Wars' were great, but I think 25-30 years later, some of the artistic tastes have definitely changed about the man.
To recap: 'Episode II' is by far a better film than its predecessor, but it still wasn't the topper to 'Empire Strikes Back'.  Hopefully the criticisms from this film will be applied to 'Episode III', and like this film, be crafted into a more satisfying product than the one before.  Despite some flaws, I did enjoy the overall movie.",8,0,1,5 January 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," Another Good-Natured Pixar Romp.
","Pixar is among one of the best things to happen to the Disney Studios in years.  From 'A Bug's Life' to both 'Toy Story' movies (and even their shorts, if you've had the chance to see them), their outings have been a lot of fun.  'Monsters Inc.' was no different.The movie felt a bit 'Nightmare Before Christmas' to me in that the ghoul's and monster's fright-making was simply just their 'job' for them.  When not scaring and causing frights, they led 'regular' everyday lives outside of the haunts.  Kind of a 'behind the scenes' look at the monsters under the bed (or in the closet, in this case).  It's a fun concept, and John Goodman and Billy Crystal pulled off the characters of Sulley and Mike very well.While I still believe that the best CG animation I've seen this year was 'Final Fantasy', the range of emotions for Mike, Sulley, Boo and the others display went much, much farther.  Boo was a cute character.  Funny, easily distracted, vulnerable... she represented the average child (about 2-3 I'm guessing) for her age.  And again, while 'Final Fantasy' was just jaw-dropping in terms of animation, 'Monsters' had its own wonderful set of effects, lighting tricks and surprises to be found.The humor in it was very funny.  Everything from physical gags to self-reference and in-jokes, the film has something to offer on every level (the Yeti being my personal favorite 'Don't worry, it's lemon!')  It also had its fair share of action scenes that offered a fair share of 'wows' and fast pacing.  Unfortunately, the soundtrack didn't really stick in my mind, as I can't remember, much less whistle any of it after the film being over. But that is a rather moot point in a movie that was supposed to be mainly slapstick with a message about how children see their fears, and laughing produces more results than scaring.  A nice little message for times like these.But the one moment that got me the most about the entire film took place in the last two minutes: Sweet natured and simple, but not sappy with a huge musical score swelling in the background to force the viewer's emotions. I honestly don't think they could have ended this film any more perfectly.An enjoyable film.  Too bad I didn't see any 'outtakes' at the end like Pixar's other efforts.  Maybe there will be something for the DVD. A good watch for 2001.",9,0,1,2 December 2001
American Pie," A teen comedy that's worth its weight in pie.
","After all of the hype generated about this is a 'must see' movie, I finally decided to see what this movie was all about once the hype died down a little.Boy, I'm glad I did.This movie isn't as 'disgusting' as a lot of people would have you believe. Sure, there's the opening scene, and the gut-wrenchingly funny pie scene (I knew about this, but it just doesn't compare to actually seeing this), the disgusting beer scene, and a brief nude scene, but there's a lot more to the movie than that.  A lot more.The story of four guys trying to lose their virginity before the end of high school is one that anyone who is currently in high school or has been in high school this past few decades can relate to.  Sex for each of the guys means a different thing, and their individual 'quests' to reach their goal are funny, could very possibly happen, and change each of the guys into something more than just a bunch of sex-starved hornballs.  The tables really start to turn when a few of the guys actually start caring about their would-be conquests and other things.I grew to really like these actors and actresses as they play their roles well, and as they grow in personality past their 'pact'.  They're typical high school kids, like it or not.Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad is hilarious with his dead-pan delivery and his never-ending attempts to help Jim through his current er, 'phase'.
Fortunately, the laughs go past just physical slap-stick humor.  The one-liners are more often than not hilarious.This movie more than reminded me of those classic '80's teen films, blending a great mix of goofiness and the awkwardness that age.  No, I don't think it's like 'There's Something About Mary'.  'Mary' was a movie that was funny just for the sake of being so.  'Pie', while having its hilarious gross-out moments, also had its fair share of sincere ones.  I liked the kids because they came off as actual people instead of one-joke cardboard teen stock.I recommend American Pie to anyone who has liked a good John Hughes '80's film or who just wants to see a movie that has likeable characters and is really funny.  American Pie has just become one of my new favorites.",8,1,1,10 August 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," BEAUTIFUL Adaption Of A Wonderful Story.
","I've grown up a fan of both 'The Hobbit' and the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.  As a child, my father used to read these stories to me before I went to bed.  And now... I've seen that world come to life.Before I get into the bulk of my review, I'd like to remind and point out a few things to the casual viewer or those who have never touched a Tolkien book: 'Fellowship' is the first of a three part series.  Unlike the Bashki animated film, which covers the majority of the first two books, this only covers Book One, and it is left very open ended and unresolved for a reason. Secondly, yes, this is a very grim fantasy film.  These characters are fighting for the fate of their world, and sacrifices will be made throughout the course of the story.  Both of these points are directly how the book addressed them.  The story has only begun in this film.  There are plenty of character developments and plot resolutions to be had.  Be patient.  Also of note: Is this a film for kids?  No.  Don't take your five year old to this expecting this film to be another 'Harry Potter'.  But again, this is how the books were.  Lastly, in regards to an earlier comment, the characters of Merry and Pippin are nothing like Jar Jar Binks.With all of that off my chest, I shall touch upon the film itself: Wow.  It truly is everything I wanted from this book-turned-film.  The landscapes of Middle-Earth (especially the Shire) are breathtaking.  Wonderful set design. The character portrayals are accurate to the characters from the book and are given a sense of dignity and comradeship that they would have needed.  I was very pleased by the casting.  The musical score is excellent.  Warm and cheerful, intense and brooding, sad, and uplifting all as needed.  The battles are ferocious, with a Braveheart-esque quality to them, and yes, they're a bit gory (what, did you really expect sword battles to be clean?), and the scary parts (especially the Riders) made even myself uncomfortable.I've never seen a book-tuned-movie touched upon with such loving care (although this year's 'Harry Potter' did a notable job).  Peter Jackson did a fine job creating Middle-Earth and its locations in their full splendor. True, there were some plot and character omissions and changes, but again, you can only squeeze so much into a 3-Plus hour story.  However, I can say that very little was left out or altered, and they kept more than they took away.  I have little reason to believe that the next two films will be anything less than as spectacular.As with 'Harry Potter', I could see why people would have a sense of confusion about this story if they have never read the books.  But hopefully, it will motivate them to read the stories for a better understanding, instead of scratching their heads or blindly criticizing the film.  This truly is a remarkable film from a technical and storytelling standpoint, regardless of whether you like this genre or not.I feel safe in saying that Tolkien fans have very little to worry about, and hopefully the average movie-goer will find a great deal of enjoyment out of this film, but they need to keep in mind before seeing this film that this is only the first part.  The sequels are there out of necessity for the story.  As for myself, I was taken back to that time when Dad read those stories to me just before I went to bed.  I loved that story now just as much as I did then, only this time, my mind's eye was projected at the local cineplex.  Truly recommended.",10,0,0,19 December 2001
Lilo & Stitch," An Entertaining Combo Of Humor and Emotion.
","When I saw the print ads for 'Lilo & Stitch', the concept seemed amusing. When I saw the parody trailers, my interest was definitely piqued.  Seeing the actual movie, it has become one of my favorite Disney films from the last few years.Above all else, the animation and lush backgrounds are stunning.  This truly is a beautiful film, with its rounded art style and realistic emotional gestures and nuances of the characters.  Among the most impressive of the lot is Stitch himself.  Even in the background, he was always doing something worth noting.  His transition from being a mischievous, trouble-making creature, to a lost and alone orphan, to a loving and caring pet.  Stitch was a character full of personality.  He was a riot when he was bad (great gags throughout), and disarmingly touching when good.  Stitch is a great character design.  Probably one of the best Disney Studios has done recently.The other characters were filled with clever one-liners, a full range of facial expressions, and a respectable amount of depth.  The film managed to balance between being hilariously funny and pulling on the heart-strings as Disney films are known to do.  Nothing seemed really heavy handed or forced in the emotion department, and the character voices really kept the film going and gave the other characters personality.As for the music, it relied on three sources: Alan Silvestri's score, the Hawaiian music and of course, Elvis.  The Elvis elements that were worked in made Stitch an even funnier character, and didn't take over the film as the only musical element.  The other musical elements provided traditional Hawaiian flair and again, a score that helped set the mood of the film (MINOR SPOILER: the best example of this is when Stitch enters the woods to be found by his family).'Lilo & Stitch' is a very funny and sweet film, filled with slapstick elements like an old Warner Bros. cartoon and a little bit of sci-fi action at the beginning and towards the end of the film.  I don't think it's as violent as some reviewers have made it out to be, but it is a very different Disney film with no princes, singing mermaids or enchanted objects.But sometimes, different is good.  Hopefully, this will take 'Best Animated Picture' for 2002.  The artwork alone should place it into the winner's circle.",9,2,2,5 January 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Entertaining Retelling Of The Original Film.
","And really, this is what T2 is.  Giving Arnold the Kyle Resse role the time around to promote Schwarzenegger's then newer 'good guy' image.  But downplaying that, this film definitely keeps the entertainment and wow factor.It's T-800 versus the shape-shifting T-1000 in another battle for the future and the fate of John Connor.  A more buff version of Linda Hamilton.  A supporting role from Sam of 'Diff'rent Stokes' as John's punk friend.  Lots of explosions, gun fights and chases.  And still remarkably good special effects even by today's standards.  Schwarzenegger has charisma.  His acting range is best in two areas, acting and comedy, and this film allows him to do both.  His cyborg persona's attempt to understand humanity ranges from funny to surprisingly touching.  The plot is a retelling of the original film, but it's a secondary point for the sheer entertainment value that's delivered from this film. There's not much that truly can be said about this film ten years after its release.  It's a landmark film in the sci-fi genre, especially for its technical advances with CG effects.  The 'Ultimate Edition' DVD released last year is a 'must get' as it adds deleted scenes to the film (The Terminator learning to smile is well worth the price of admission), as well as the 'extras' book and all the 'Behind the Scenes' information.  And the audio quality is nothing to sneeze at, either.  An excellent demonstration of any sound system.Terminator 2: Judgement Day remains a remarkable film.  Go in expecting lots of action and a classic Arnold performance, and there will be little to be disappointed with.  With a 'T3' in the works, it seems that not only the future of humanity is uncertain, but of this franchise as well.  Hopefully they'll be able to one-up the standards of sci-fi again, and not be out just to make a quick buck.",8,4,5,25 December 2001
Spider-Man," Another Great Marvel Comic Movie.
","I meant to review this months ago when I had (by great luck) managed to attend the premiere in Los Angeles.  Regardless, with a 'better late than never' attitude, this has turned out to be one of Summer 2002's bright spots in an incredibly busy movie season.As it stands, 'Spider-Man' has all the right elements: A real comic book 'feel' to it, an excellent Danny Elfman score, Tobey Maguire as a totally believable Peter Parker (with just the right amounts of shyness and the 'old Parker luck'), an appropriately sinister Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, and a scene-stealing performance by J. K. Simmons as the cigar-chomping J. Jonah Jameson.  That's a character that should have been used more in the movie, as he was a lot of fun to see in action.  Here's hoping for more screen time in the next one.There wasn't a lot that I didn't like about this movie.  I still didn't like the Green Goblin costume as much as I tried to, the organic web-shooters didn't bother me half as much as I had figured (perhaps as they weren't overplayed as being so), and while Kirsten Dunst didn't do a bad job as Mary Jane, she just never really captured the 'look' of what I though the character should be.As for the 'goods' of the film, the battles were perfectly set up as comic-cook style brawls, with plenty of exaggerated movements and situations.  When Spider-Man web-swung through the streets of New York (love the costume), I couldn't help but get a chilled sense of awe that I originally felt after seeing the first trailer last year.  And the character relationships were great.  'Spider-Man' the comic has always been as much about the man behind the mask as it is about the hero.  I'm so relieved that Sam Raimi took noticeable attempts to balance the two.Despite its comic-book origins, the last battle is pretty intense, comparably so to the Tim Burton 'Batman' films.  And the Green Goblin's scare tactics even made myself jump a few times.  So parents with very little ones may want to check out the film first to see if the kids can handle it.  But in that regard, I'm glad Raimi took the film seriously enough to not let it delve into the lame campiness that was 'Batman & Robin'.  And I'm really glad that they didn't take too many liberties with the Spider-Man origin to remove the emotional impact that it carried throughout the film.As a movie, it retained all of the wonder, excitement and fun that has endeared me to Spider-Man since I was a kid.  As a super-hero film, I can compare it to the orignal 'Batman' and 'Superman' films in its high-quality treatment.  I will wait impatiently for the feature-packed (I hope) DVD, and will have faith that the next installment of the series will be as rewarding as this one was.  A must see.  A fun movie.",9,0,0,30 June 2002
Resident Evil," Solid Film Interpretation Of The Video Game.
","Admittedly, I had my hesitations about this film.  I really, really wanted to like this movie, but the way some magazines and on-line sites were talking about the plot synopsis (a computer turning people into the undead and not the game's T-Virus), I had some concerns.  Fortunately, after seeing the film, my concerns were eased, and such rumors didn't come to pass.This film now resides in my 'Top 3' (Mortal Kombat and Final Fantasy being the other two) of video game based films.  And this is how the film should be looked at: A film that relies on a video game for its source material and story set-up.  The film starts out slow, offering background information on the Umbrella Corporation, and introducing the viewer to the victims caught up in a situation they were ill-prepared to handle.  The scenes (especially the Hive map layout) are set up like a video game.  Again, for this type of film, it can get away with this and work properly if kept in that frame of mind.  Once the zombies appear, the tone of the film gets much more intense, especially with scenes from some of the game's more 'popular' enemies.For a horror film, it's not as gory as I would have expected.  It does have its fair share of 'gross' moments, but succeeds more in some good old fashioned jumps and false 'gotcha' scares scattered throughout the film. What really surprised me was that the film actually had some brief flashes of nudity in it.  Then again, this really isn't a movie for kids, and I'm glad this wasn't dumbed down to be so.The acting was decent, introducing new characters to the RE world (which kept things unpredictable as to who lived and who died, which made it more interesting in my opinion), and being the same director who did the original Mortal Kombat film, it was filled with plenty of flashy fight scenes to fast music.  What really sat well with me in regards to this film is that the movie made plenty of subtle references to elements from the games (the crows, Nemesis, the mansion, limited ammo comments, etc.) without screaming to the audience 'Hey, this prop is also from the game!  This scene is just like the game!  We included everything whether it needed to be there or not just to keep RE fans happy!'  While I'm sure some people would have delighted in seeing the protagonists pushing around statues and opening doors with playing card-shaped keys, the movie rewards the die-hard fan with plenty of references if they look hard enough.  The feel of the game was captured without going overboard.Granted, some people have likened the film to 'Aliens' and 'Night of the Living Dead', but that's something of a moot point.  Yes, there are similarities, and no the story isn't the most original thing out there, but the game series does take inspiration from such films to enhance the tension for the game.  Basing these elements from the game for a movie only makes things come full circle.  The film is meant to capture the feel of the game and provide some entertainment while it's at it.  In that regard, it succeeds in what it sets out to do.So is it worth it?  If you enjoy the games, then yes.  It's fun, it's got its creepy moments, it's got a great ending sequence (excellent 'closure' for the film, if you can call it that), and hopefully the sequel won't go the way of the second Mortal Kombat film (read: bad).Hopefully, there will be a Director's Cut DVD.  I have a feeling that some scenes were cut out of this.  Excellent popcorn fare, and a future addition to my DVD collection.",8,0,0,28 March 2002
Alien vs. Predator," This Could Have Been So Much More.
","I have always been a fan of the 'Alien' movies. Even the weaker installments, I've found some traces of good in them. And admittedly, I found some parts in here that I liked....But you can already sense the 'but' I'm about to interject, can't you?There were some gaping issues with this film, starting with the characters: You knew almost nothing about them, and what's worse, cared even less. Take 'Aliens' for example. Every Space Marine, no matter how early in the film they died, you knew something about them. You knew about their motivations or relationships with the others, or even how they handled crisis situations. With the introduction of the 'best of the best' hand-picked 'Jurassic Park'-esquire team of scientists, you don't even get that luxury, even with the drawn-out meeting and trip to the dig site. A few nice 'Bishop' references, but that's about all the viewer gets for things to come in the series. There was one female character who talks about 'always being prepared' as she brings her gun along, but with that hint of foreshadowing, you think she'd play a pivotal role in the film. Think again.And then the frustration with actual meeting of the Aliens. What did they do to the incubation period? I've seen bags of Jiffy Pop that don't complete as fast as the chestbursters in this film. What was an hours/day long process in the previous films was instigated and completed even before the researchers had time to leave the first room. After the long character set-up that established absolutely nothing, I can understand wanting to get the plot rolling, but you can't cheat the established 'rules' of the characters to get there. But Anderson did anyway.I had issues with the Predators, save for one hardier survivor. So much for the 'great warriors' that they've always been known as. The fight scenes (which should have been the whole meat of this film), were reduced to little more than spastic jump cuts that obscured the majority of the action.People have been waiting YEARS to see this, from all the video game and comic book stories, and it's reduced to a PG-13 slugfest that doesn't show the intensity and no-holds barred attitude that should have been there. Both 'Alien' and 'Predator' are R-rated franchises. They should have stayed that way for a reason. The main heroine was certainly no Ripley, which makes one wonder how she was able to survive through the continued challenges in the film. And lets not forget another 'Jurassic Park' fight moment between the survivors and the Alien Queen. Anderson must love the JP films, because so many references were lifted from the first film.It's not that I hated this movie, it's just that after waiting for so many years, it wasn't what it should have been. They cheated established character rules. They gave characters you couldn't care less about. It took too long to get to the title grudge match, and even when it did, poor editing destroyed any intensity it could have had. And the 'surprise ending' is what should have been done a few minutes before the ending, so that there would have been more to play with in the film. I wanted to see THAT as the ending conflict. Not a Jurassic Park tribute with the Alien Queen. They had so much to work with, and they didn't.The only positive aspect of the film were a few 'Bishop' references, and a few cool moves during some of the conflicts.I wanted more. I got a little. Hopefully they'll do it better next time, or release a 'Director's Cut' on DVD to actually make the fights worthwhile.",6,0,0,10 September 2004
Ghostbusters," The funniest 'horror' movie I've seen.
","I remember seeing 'Ghostbusters' in the theaters back in 1984, and I've occasionally watched it over the years on video.  It was getting the DVD version that made me realize without a doubt, that this is one of the most clever movies of the '80's.For a comedy/horror film, this really succeeds.  The most standout feature of the movie are the actors.  Bill Murray, Harold Ramis and Dan Ackroyd play so well off of each other, and the fun supporting cast only strengthens them.  The special effects are really good, resulting in something that's not quite scary or creepy, but definitely in the 'weird' category.The movie is lighthearted, fun, never takes itself too seriously, but never dips into the 'cheesy' factor.  The one-liners are some of the funniest and most memorable put into a film.'Ghostbusters' excels as a 'fun' movie.  From the still-catchy theme song, wild inventions, and a crew of ghost-hunters that are intent in saving New York, yet seem like they're not always exactly sure what they're doing (a far cry from the standard action hero), add up for a classic '80's movie. Definitely, a film to watch, and the DVD version is a 'must-have'.",9,0,0,12 August 1999
Moulin Rouge!," A Surprisingly Bold Film.
","Let's face it: It's hard to release a musical in these modern times if it's not animated or doesn't have the Disney name attached to it.  What worked as a staple in the '50's is all but shunned in the last few decades.  And now 'Moulin Rouge' comes out.  Whether or not it will revitalize the musical genre remains to be seen, but at least it's something to take notice of.Well, yes and no.  Everyone I've heard critique this movie has said either you're going to love this film or hate it.  There's no middle ground.  And I think that's a fair assumption.  Some people just can't stand singing in a film.  I, however, really liked the film, but I heard a person or two grumbling as they walked out, wishing they had seen 'Pearl Harbor' instead. But almost enough about my film-going experience.This film's look is as bright and flashy as the on-screen action itself. Huge elaborate sets, detailed costumes, special effects and numerous camera tricks definitely keep things interesting.  There were a lot of things that I liked about this movie.  Bear in mind that I studied film in college so I 'got' a lot of visual tricks the director was trying to do.  I think it's going to be a little hard for some general audience to catch some of the attitudes and styles if you haven't watched a lot of films from the musical era, and even before that.  'Moulin Rouge' has a cartoony atmosphere to it at times, but you can tell the actors are having fun with their roles.Speaking of actors, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are exceptional in their roles.  I never would have thought either to have singing talent, but they do.  I was very surprised, and their acting complimented their singing very well.  The songs are clever, cycling through SEVERAL popular hits from several decades (often in the same song), which resulted in several laughs from the audience.  The rest of the supporting cast held their own as well. And thankfully, that amazingly obnoxious and overplayed (Hence why it's obnoxious) 'Lady Marmalade' remake factors in and is spaced throughout the film for less than two minutes, and gratefully doesn't blare as the credits roll.  Thank God for keeping artistic integrity.  The previews and the radio make you think the whole movie is based around this one song.I think the film's biggest hang-up for me was due to the camera tricks.  It walked a very fine line between being amusing at times and very distracting. I nearly walked out on Luhrmann's camera antics in 'Romeo + Juliet', but fortunately, he tones this down within the first 20 minutes.'Moulin Rouge' is a hard film to recommend.  I liked it, but I can see reasons why people wouldn't.  But if anything, it's a film to see if you would like to see something a little different, or at least McGregor or Kidman display a new facet of their versatility.  Worth the risk of something out of the ordinary.",9,0,0,2 June 2001
Transformers," When Summer Blockbusters Go Really REALLY Wrong.
","When the announcement came for a new Transformers movie for Summer, I was pretty excited. I wasn't a major Transformers fan, but I had fond memories of the cartoon and toys. However, I hated the re-designed Transformers, thinking that these new designs were an overly busy cross between Lego's Bionicle toys and expressionist modern art sculptures. I also heard the script was poor, so I decided to skip this one.However, I started hearing movie reviews about what an amazing film this was. 'The greatest film of all time!' people proclaimed. So I came to terms with and accepted that these weren't the robots I grew up with, this was a 'new' version, and I'd at least find interest in robots transforming into cars and beating each other up. I'd even go see this even though I don't like Michael Bay films.How was it? Transformers is a disgustingly bloated and self-indulgent piece of crap. I understand that I'll get rated down for my review, but I'm prepared to accept that. Sadly, my theater must not have gotten the euphoria inducing gas that apparently other theaters got, causing me to gush over this film like other people.Even the 1986 Transformers film wasn't perfect. It was basically one fight scene after another, and was a means to replace the old toys for a new line, but the action was good, showed the consequences of war, and featured the death of a beloved character. It kept true to the mythos, even though it was different. This movie makes reference to so many other films that it feels like a mishmash of 30 films you've seen before.Bumblebee sends up an 'Autobat Symbol' to summon the other Autobots like Batman. There's a scene in an underground bunker which felt totally pulled from Terminator 3 (and a few scenes later, uses the exact drumbeat from the 'Terminator Theme'). The fight scenes with their out of focus cameras and 'shaky cam' style seems like they are trying to treat the battles as if they were 'Saving Private Ryan' caliber. When Bumblebee gets captured during a scene, the music swells up so mournfully and overdramatically, that it makes the tragedies found in 'Schindler's List' seem modest.The biggest problem in character design lies in the fact that they all really do look alike. The worst offender was the Decepticon Frenzy, which looked like a 3D rendered pencil scribble, and acted like the Zuni Fetish Doll from 'Trilogy of Terror'. During the final battle, I was having problems telling who was who, and when the robots collided, it was hard to see where one began and the other ended. The car forms were presented as blatant product showcases, ripped straight from a commercial. Then again, there was so much product placement in the film. eBay must have made a fortune.The slow set-up to the action or even any real glimpses of the title characters felt like 'The Hulk'. I pay for a movie about transforming robots, that's what I want to see.Why would they keep a deadly robot under Hoover Dam, a major water source and tourist attraction? Why would they bring this 'All-Spark' out of the desert and into a heavily-populated city where property damage and civilian casualties could run their full course. The dialogue was painful, sounded like it was written for teenagers, by teenagers in a really bad fanfic like what they thought people would say. What really irked me is how the Autobots couldn't seem to kill a Decepticon, but a lone soldier skidding on his back could dispatch one with a single shot. Why were the Autobots even there if the humans could do it better? How is it that they can save Bumblebee, but they can't repair Jazz? What was the difference? The government/military/robot/anyone dialogue was totally unrealistic, with officials willing to 'bet their ridiculously high government paychecks' on hunches. Every line smacked on bad puns, clichés, or just sounded stupid. There was an extended conversation about masturbation between Sam and his parents that felt really awkward and extended far too long.The personalities were also way underdeveloped. Transformers has over two decades of history that wasn't touched upon. The Starscream and Megatron rivalry, where Starscream tried to usurp Megatron for leadership was not mentioned or covered at all. Jazz was cool and fun-loving with a sense of style, while in the film he sounds like a ghetto thug. His first line is profanity, and I felt insulted. Not because of the language, but the fact that this was apparently the best the writers could do. Decepticons were introduced and blown away within minutes. The Autobots weren't much better. Did the people who wrote the story know anything about the subject material besides the fact that robots changed to vehicles? And then Optimus Prime. Obviously, Bay's madness knew better than to totally ruin this character, as he was the only robot who looked even remotely familiar to any previous version. And the personality was fairly accurate... up to the backyard scene, where Prime's personality suddenly shifts, breaks character, and he becomes a clumsy comedian. The next scene, he shifts back into a 'leader' personality.The saving grace outside of Prime was Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf), who brought a credible 'gee whiz' performance to the film, and yet I felt sorry for him using such ham-fisted dialogue.Summer 2007 has been really mediocre for 'blockbuster' films, as we're apparently supposed to lower our standards, 'sit back, not think and enjoy' with these types of films, but how is one supposed to do that with with film devoid of heart, personality or no focus on the main characters? As a stand-alone film, this is a really bad movie. As a Transformers-licensed film, it's a God awful embarrassment. I'm avoiding the sequels unless they drastically overhaul the franchise and get a script not limited to high-school level online fanfic.",1,671,1071,8 July 2007
The Nightmare Before Christmas," One Of My Most Enduring Favorites.
","I felt it fitting to review this on its 10th year anniversary, especially around Halloween.  This film has remained one of my all-time favorite films, with its characters, music, and story.  It's a whimsical tale that retains its charm with every viewing.The tale is a simple one: Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, tires of his title, and wants something more in his life.  Something new to inspire him.  After an all-night walk through the woods, he stumbles upon a forest clearing with oddly shaped doors in the trees.  Upon opening the Christmas door, Jack is whisked away to a new world.  And there, the magic begins.Actually, the magic begins within the first few seconds of the film's opening, but it is Jack's discovery of the unknown that makes the film have a fun (if macabre) feel, as the well-intentioned skeleton makes a mess of something he works so hard to offer as a gift.Visually, this film is unlike anything seen in a long time, and certainly not in the last 10 years.  The character design of Jack is still one of my personal favorites (elegant and graceful), and the other characters all have their own personality, even if regulated to a background scene.  There's only one real 'bad guy' in this film (Oogie Boogie), and even his method of being menacing is simply being a master showman with a penchant for odds and gambling.  Stop-motion is an almost all but lost art form, especially in this modern age of CG special effects, and when you really watch how much effort was put into making this film, you can't help but appreciate it all the more.Musically, this is one of Danny Elfman's finest.  Spooky and somber, but light and at times invokes a sweetness to its nature, including the long but silent romantic intentions between Jack and Sally.  The music invokes a fun feeling to the film, and the lyrics are clever and playful.The story is very simple, but it was also inspired by one of Burton's short stories, which explains its basic premise.  The story was stretched out to make a feature length film, but any minor quibbles are easy to look over as the film is just such a wonder to watch and listen to.Overall, this has always been one of my favorite animated films, and I've been so glad that Disney has been starting to give it the attention it deserves, instead of still regulating it to the popular, but obscure cult following that a film like 'TRON' has.A beautifully stylish film that fails to diminish no matter how many times it's viewed.",9,0,2,23 October 2003
Big Fish," A Love Story Of Multiple Depths.
","I have always been a fan of Tim Burton's films.  From 'Batman' to 'Nightmare Before Christmas' to 'Edward Scissorhands' to 'Sleepy Hollow', his films have been some of the most whimsical and stylish I've seen created.  And 'Big Fish' retains those elements.  But this film has so much more of a 'grown up' feel to it, yet it retains those child-like moments of wonder Burton is known for.At it's heart, 'Big Fish' is a love story.  It's the story of a man trying to reconcile with and get to know his father.  But it's also a story of a man's single love and devotion to his wife.  But it's also a love of life. A love of stories.  And the belief that nothing is impossible to attain if it's really wanted strongly enough.Edward Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney - both excellent) tells the tale of his life's story, a tale that walks the fine line between truth and fiction.  Every obstacle and challenge is met with McGregor's grin and the belief that any obstacle can be overcome, often with humorous or surprising results.  This is a very light-hearted film, taking even its most serious moments with a grain of charm, sentiment or playfulness.  It gets emotional, but never delves into sap.  And you can't help but cheer for this likable character who ends up touching so many lives.  The world he grew up in may or may not be real, but the devotion and love for his wife and son are truth.While different in overall tone from his other films, Burton still adds his own trademark touches.  Cast usuals like Danny Devito and Helena Bonham Carter add to the diverse cast in this film, and Danny Elfman provides another excellent score.  The acting from all the cast members were really well-done, whether they were cameos, or full roles.  Burton has always chosen an eclectic cast for his films, and this film is no different. Everyone, even at the most basic level, shines.There are so many words to describe this film: Funny, touching, eccentric, uplifting, sad, artistic, inspiring.... but this is the type of film that can be walked away from with a sense of satisfaction.  Burton attempted something very different for him, and yet managed to retain all of the elements that make his films so appealing.  I think this film will force critics to view his films in a new light, as he has once again proven to be a more than capable director.  It's a remarkable work of art, utterly charming, and very highly recommended.One of the best pictures of 2003.",10,0,0,13 January 2004
Toy Story 2," Toy Story 2 Puts the Fun Back Into Movies.
","I didn't see Toy Story 2 the day it came out, but every review and every person kept repeating the same thing over and over: 'Toy Story 2 is better than the original'.  I decided not to pay too much attention to the hype until I saw the movie myself and form my own opinion.Here it is: Toy Story 2 is better than the original.Don't get me wrong.  I thought the first movie was fantastic, but this movie was a blast to watch from the second it started to the end credits.  I laughed out loud at several points in the movie because of the in-jokes, fast one liners, visual gags and the not-too-subtle parodies of Star Wars, Jurassic Park and even the original Toy Story.  A lot of lines were reused from the first film, but the context of how they were used in these new situations were clever.  This is an intelligent movie and doesn't talk down to the viewer, regardless of age.  Did I mention the CG effects (the movie itself?) in this film were even more of a technical 'wow' than the first movie?I liked the new characters, which fit in with the old favorites and the storyline without seeming like there were an overwhelming abundance of characters.  Each character made their own contribution to the plot, however minor, and the story never seemed to drag on for me.Overall, this was a fun movie to simply sit back and enjoy.  It's thoughtful, funny and yet another quality animated movie from 1999.  This year seems to be the one that the animation genre truly gets its due.  If a Part 3 is ever made, I hope Disney maintains the quality that the first two films of the series have set.Incidentally,  Jessie's song will probably make a lot of people feel really guilty for ever abandoning an old toy. It certainly pulls on the emotional heartstrings.",9,0,1,8 December 1999
Groundhog Day," My Favorite Bill Murray Movie.
","What would you do if you could live the same day over and over again?  Bill Murray as Phil Connors had to find this out in one of my favorite comedies of all time.  'Groundhog Day' could have been severely repetitive based on being forced to live a day over and over until Connors gets it right. The film goes from Murray's change from a cynical, self-centered weatherman to a suicidal depressive to someone who makes life better for everyone else, including himself.  It's often hilarious, many times heartfelt and sad, touching and ultimately rewarding.  You watch Bill Murray's character go from lust to love over Andie McDowell, and his evolution to not only make himself better for her, but overall.I've seen this film countless times, and it still gets me how thoughtful and well-written this film is.  It's full of great dialogue and some clever sight gags and humor.  It's never too silly or too sappy.Movies like this are rare and not usually pulled off this well that have such a unique premise.  Bill Murray proves that while he's still among one of the funniest people around, he can also pull off a convincing romantic lead.  Definitely worth seeing for those who like comedy/romance films.",9,0,0,15 July 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," One of the Best Book To Movie Adaptions I've Seen.
","I've waited a while to see Harry Potter.  I've read the books, loved the world, and admittedly, I've been a little hesitant as I've watched this great series overmarketed to the point where it's almost the next Pokemon.Fortunately, the movie retains the dignity of the book.I've seen a lot of mixed reaction to this film.  Some absolutely love it. Others think it slow-paced and incredibly dull.  I think the enjoyment of this film will be based on if you read the books or not.  I do think some of the terminology and 'understoods' of the character motivations in the movie would be somewhat incomprehensible for someone not initiated with Potter's world.  Hopefully, this would prompt the uninitiated to read the books before they blast this movie or see the next one.  The source material is very accurate with only minor deviations.That aside, as someone who HAS read the book, I thought the film was quite simply delightful; a term that I normally don't use in describing a film. It adequately captures the moments that made the book so much fun to read. It captures all the details of the books, from Halloween to Christmas, the the 'Return of the Jedi'-esque (in speed and pacing at least) Quidditch match, and even the moments of Harry's wonder of his new world as well as his feelings of dealing with the truth of the loss of his parents.  What moments I feared would be lost in the translation were kept in there.  As for the cast themselves, the children playing Harry, Ron and Hermione were very likable and accurate to their book counterparts.  The same goes for the adults as well.True, like any book-based movie, there are changes.  The good news is that even if they moved a conversation or act, they normally made reference to it in some way rather than forgetting it.  The biggest omission I noticed was the removal of Peeves.  Hopefully, he'll make a return in the second film.Another thing people have criticized about this film is John Williams' score.  Yes, it does not have the impact of say Star Wars, E.T., Indiana Jones or Schindler's List, but it does add to the film and not 'overwhelm' it 'sell the movie' like a lot of people feel it does.  There's no one forcing hands or wallets to go buy the soundtrack.  Perhaps people wanted a soundtrack with Jessica Simpson or yet another film with Smashmouth's 'All-Star' placed in it. As a fan, I had a good time with this film, and was glad to see that they kept the feel of the book as well as they did.  For a 'children's' (I used the term loosely based off the number of adults who enjoy it as well) film, clocking in around 2 1/2 hours is a pretty long time to ask kids to sit through, but I think older kids will be able to.  Plus, there are a few scenes that may be a bit too intense for the little ones, such as dealing with Voldemort and Fluffy.I recommend this film.  It's easily one of the best I've seen for this year. I will, however, give this recommendation: If you don't know Harry Potter, I really suggest reading the book before or directly after seeing this film so you can make comparisons to it.  You'll find the two don't change that much from the other, and knowing the source material beforehand, while not mandatory, will certainly help make the experience that much more enjoyable. And if you don't want to read the books, ask someone close by.  You'll run across more people who know of it than don't.One can only wonder how long a film the phonebook-sized Book 4 will be....",10,0,0,2 December 2001
Love Actually," Well Done, Actually.
","To to a brief summary, this has been one of the more uplifting, witty and 'feel good' films that I've seen this year, if not the most.  A combination of solid writing and an incredible cast makes this worth the watch for those who are not completely cynical on the concept of love.The overall plot follows the life of several couples or wannabe couples, and an aging rock star who could care less about 'Christmas spirit' or a quality record. It's all about making a quick buck and a quicker comeback.  That particular subplot is hilarious due to 'Billy Mack's' blatant and unrestrained candor that his newest 'hit single' is utter garbage.The other plots each have their own charming moments, though my personal favorites had to do with Hugh Grant's, Liam Neeson's, and Colin Firth's subplots.  In my opinion, those were the more charming and fun of the stories.  But each story each had their own little moments, never really focusing too heavily on anything negative, and everything (generally with the exception of one or two) came to their own little happy ending.  This was carefully designed as a 'feel good' movie, and it does its job very well.  And fortunately, the movie never drags or lingers in pacing, making the overall experience a satisfying one.  And very, very funny.The acting is remarkable.  It's amazing that this film would be able to have an ensemble cast of this size and caliber, and be able to utilize them as properly as they were.  The writing is clever and witty, with realistic sounding dialogue, and a nice 'bookcase' feeling for the beginning and end. The subplot of Colin Frissell is by far the most far-fetched and unrealistic of the stories, but it's genuinely funny because it is so unbelievable. The soundtrack is light and pop music filled, and even helps the story along at points, instead of blaring for you to buy the soundtrack for a '5 minute career Top 40' artist.As mentioned earlier, this film is designed purely to cheer the audience up, and to cheer on the concept that love can happen for anyone in some form. It plays heavily on the 'happy' factor without delving into sickly-sweet sap that you just can't take.  All this, and an eccentric cameo by Rowan Atkinson.It's nice to see a film like this that relies more on well-written humor and solid acting than what a lot of films have been missing lately.  I really couldn't get enough of this film, and I look forward to its eventual DVD release.Recommended if you just want to spend 2 1/2 hours having a movie cheer you up.",10,0,1,6 December 2003
Army of Darkness," The Masterpiece of One-Liners.
","What sets 'Army of Darkness apart from most horror/adventure films is Bruce Campbell's hilarious one-liners.  Gone is the meek Ash from the original 'Evil Dead'.  Instead, Ash belts out sarcastic quips just as fast as bullets from his shotgun.  The end result is a campy, entertaining movie that, while not as frightening or gory as the first films in the series, holds its own for pure entertainment value. 
I can't believe something like this wouldn't have drawn big sales in the box office.  While I'd like to see another in the series, I'd like to see more of the scares of the original mixed with the humor of this film.Overall, a fun movie, and definitely a cult classic.",8,1,1,27 April 2000
Jaws," Sometimes One Forgets How Good A Film Is.
","It's been a while since I've watched the original 'Jaws', and then I decided to it up on DVD.It just goes to show how such a simple premise can make a great film.Genuinely scary for its time (and still remarkably effective today), 'Jaws' has a 26-foot great white shark terrorize a small resort community. Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw all make good as the group set on destroying the dreaded killer fish, and the supporting roles do a nice job of fleshing out the citizens of Amity.The end result are some tense and mildly gory frights, another classic John Williams score, and a thoroughly entertaining movie.  The 25th anniversary re-release is worth getting, especially if you don't own the movie already. The film has been nicely restored, with an informative 'making of' documentary, theatrical trailers, deleted scenes (see Quint terrorize oboe playing children!) and a few extras give this package some real (forgive the pun) meat.A fun classic film, although its sequels are absolutely ridiculous.  (Come on, when do sharks really take things 'personal'?)",9,1,3,23 July 2000
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," As Pure A Film As Its Namesake (Minus the 'Seven Dwarfs' Part).
","Since the 1930's, Disney animated films have been a strange collection. Some are made to present new ideas in story and animation and push the limits of the genre of animated film.  Others have been purely formulatic and meant as little more than money makers.  But overall, there have been more hits than misses (at least with their feature film animation).  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs really did push the revolution.A few years shy of 70, the film still holds up really well, especially with the remastered print and even moreso on DVD.  It's the other animated character (besides a certain mouse) that built the house of Disney, and it's obvious as to why when seen.  It's a beautiful film, with great animation, a simple story and at the risk of sounding like a press release, truly unforgettable songs and characters.  It's a part of American film history, up there with 'Casablanca' and 'Citizen Kane', and even the more modern classics like 'Star Wars' and 'Indiana Jones'.  It's aged well, and it shows why sometimes simplicity is truly the way to go in terms of presenting a story.  It has a straightforward manner with plenty of visual marvels, especially when you sit back and realize how long this film has been around, and how even some animation of today still can't compare.The DVD itself is filled with more background information than a person can watch in one sitting.  It really makes up for the initial discs released by Disney DVD, and bodes well for later classics such as 'Aladdin', 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Lion King' and 'Sleeping Beauty' (Can you tell which ones I'm waiting for?).A must see for any film animation fan, but you probably already knew that.",9,2,3,13 October 2001
The Iron Giant," The 'E.T.' of Animated Robot Films.
","I don't know what was wrong with me.  Why did it take me so long to see this wonderful film?  'Iron Giant' is one of the the most intelligent, touching, feel-good animated films to come out in a LONG time.  For that matter, why didn't anyone see this film last Summer?  A wonderful story with a great voice cast and entertaining story.  The Giant is simply an amazing character.  Not for his technical gadgets, but for his range of expressions and the ability to become thoroughly engrossed with his adventure.The messages in this film, from the 'Red Scare' sentiments, to discussing death, freedom to be who you are, and the a little boy's perspective of what a soul is make this deeper than any recent Disney film that comes to mind. The robot's desire to be a hero like Superman really tugged at the old emotions on my part.  The robot, even in his darker moment, was truly an innocent.I hope the low box office sales don't scare Warner Brothers off from trying something like this again.  It just makes me absolutely ill that something like 'Pokemon' can clean up at the box office, and this was all but forgotten.  I hope it gets the praise it deserves on video.",10,1,2,30 November 1999
Shrek," An Entertaining & Amusing Film.
","I've been looking forward to 'Shrek'.  The previews looked great, and I like Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, but the initial few moments of Smashmouth's 'All-Star' made me first think of 'Mystery Men', and then 'Why is a Top 40 hit in an animated film set in a fairy tale past?'  Admittedly, all the music specifically designed for the 'film's (naturally) smash soundtrack' did turn me off a little, and it lost a point for that, as I would have given it a nine easily.  But the rest of the musical score was fine.  Note to filmmakers:  Bad.  Bad.  Don't use 'hip' marketing ploys in good movies as it only hinders, not helps.As for the rest of the film, I did enjoy it.  Quite a bit, actually.  The CG was simply amazing.  There were several times when the line between 'reality' and animation was effectively blurred, so technically, it was impressive.  I also had a good time with the story.  'Shrek' took a few solid jabs at Disney, such as Lord Farquaad's blatantly theme-park inspired castle to some character designs, to even the goofy song at an inappropriate moment (of which this film pokes even harder fun at).  It also has a few nods to 'Matrix' and 'Babe'.The film is very, very funny at times.  Mostly in part to the voices, but some characters, such as the Gingerbread Man and Robin Hood made for great scenes.  The dragon was also a really impressive visual treat.From extremely detailed character expressions, to genuine laughs, to a few surprisingly sweet-natured moments, this film offered quite a bit, and even threw in a little 'adult humor' and profanity at times.  But it's light stuff, so it's not too bad.  I guess besides the Top 40 music, the only other two things I didn't like about the film (but so many other films do it, that I can't singularly criticize this film) is all the 'fart humor'. Another note to filmmakers:  Stop, please.  Enough.  Whoever in Hollywood that is telling you this is prime comedy material is lying to you.  It's not funny.*SPOILER*Also, the film never quite explained what Farquaad did to remove the fairy tale characters from Shrek's swamp, or where they all went until the film's end.*END SPOILER*Despite a few small gripes, I had a good time watching the film, and I could easily recommend it during this summer's movie rush.  Definitely worth a look, and I'll be interested to seeing what special features are offered when it hits for DVD.  Recommended.",8,0,0,18 May 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," To Sum Up In A Word: Zany.
","I wasn't overly enthused by the previews for this film, but I tend to enjoy a good animated film, so I was still going to give this one a chance.  What I WASN'T counting on is the fact that I would be laughing out loud in the theaters on a constant basis, and even more when I got the movie on DVD.'Emperor's New Groove' is kind of light on story.  There's no epic feel to it and the situations are silly.  But I think that's what makes the film. It's incredibly fast-paced with a great sense of comedic timing ('reaction' humor is one of the funniest forms of comedy out there, in my opinion), witty one-liners, and complete unpredictability make it stand out from the other Disney films.  It makes fun of itself, speaks directly to the audience at time, and when it throws logic out the window, it doesn't hold back on pointing it out.  Disney's never done (not to my immediate recollection, anyway) a 'buddy flick' before, and the fact that it doesn't pull any stops on the comedy makes it really enjoyable.  And to it's true appeal, Yzma and Kronk are by far some of the most entertaining villains that Disney has done in a LONG time.  Finally, bad guys with real personality.  And for those who fear a song-filled Disney movie, 'ENG' only has one song at the beginning. Everything else is WAY out there.The 2-Disc DVD is worth the money.  Tons of stuff on the animated process. Disney Home Video has come a long way in doing their films right.  I wish the earlier ones had been treated this well.I haven't laughed this hard at a Disney movie since the original 'Aladdin'.",Null,0,1,1 May 2001
Toy Story 3," Pixar Goes Past The Heart, And Straight For The Soul.
","It's been a long time since a recent movie has made me think.How can they, really? Mainstream movies have become all about marketing ploys with characters designed to adorn a Taco Bell cup, and rehashing of ideas and franchises we've already seen from the last few decades. We're stuck with movies that cost no less than $12 on a good day, and are using 3D as a means to keep us in the theaters and away from our home theaters. Is it little wonder why people have grown cynical? Doesn't a 'Part 3' mean that we're just getting more of the same, even with a pedigree as strong as Pixar's? No. It doesn't. And that's where something very different sets in.The most jarring realization is that Toy Story 3 is set in real-time. It's not the animated character that remains ageless. Andy has grown up with us, and like us, has become an adult as well. He's even voiced by his (also grown) original voice actor, and it puts it even more into perspective.But toys don't age. Sure, Woody, Buzz and the gang have a few paint scuffs here and there, but they remain true to themselves. But times have changed. Andy's toy room is paired down to the surviving 'favorites' who made the cut past the garage sales or getting lost or broken. Some old friends are gone and briefly twinge sadly upon the character's memories when the names are said, but there's something more. All they want is to be played with and simply feel their human friend's touch after years of neglect.If Toy Story 3 sounds like a depressing film, it isn't. There are some wonderful characters. The old toys are still as vibrant and funny as ever, the new toys (such as a fabulously metrosexual Ken doll and a creepy cymbal monkey) are hilarious new additions to the cast, and as bitter as a stuffed bear can be for an enemy, there's a real level of sympathy for what made him the way he is.And that's the thing about Toy Story 3. It's a love story. And a coming of age story. And a story about the fears of losing someone, or being rejected or abandoned, and the need to be useful and loved by someone. And it's a story about friends sticking together, because in this world, that's all they have.The beginning aspect of the story is standard for Toy Story 3 is a familiar 'The toys get separated from Andy and must find their way home' story, but it's the journey there that's different, and of all the characters, Woody has matured the most.Gone is the spoiled, jealous 'favorite' who retains a conscience, and later loses sight of his priorities and duties to be there for Andy. He's older, and wiser. He understands that he not only has to be there for his human friend, but his toy friends as well.Buzz is no different. From delusional hero to realizing what he is, becoming comfortable with that, and providing his unwavering support, Buzz shows a new side as well. He's certainly funny, and hits his prime in this film, but he's content in what he is, and finally loosens up.From potatoes to piggy banks to dinosaurs and restaurant squeak toys, the gang has seen a lot together, and in the final act, in easily their worst predicament yet, it struck me how 'real' they had become. Like Andy, these toys were friends that I grew up with over the last 15 years. It's a powerful testament to Pixar that these little toys had dreams and deep emotions, and unwavering loyalty. Of course, you know nothing bad is going to happen to them, but the sincerity of one shared moment in the garbage dump was an amazing testament to a very pure moment of love and loyalty, and proving that how you live your life is just as important as how you prepare for your end. A day later, I still find myself pondering the implications of what I've taken from this film.Again, this film is not a 'downer' movie by any means. The ending is earned and well-deserved. Like the rest of the film, it's bittersweet and very 'real', and I found myself simultaneously smiling and choking up with its resolution, and a yearning for my own stuffed and plastic friends long gone.Pixar has again broken the mold with a brand of storytelling that can reach out to children and the child still in adults. Other films could learn a lot about Pixar's philosophy, animated or otherwise, and tell a story that comes from the heart, and not designed to promote a website or soda.It doesn't get much better than this. Especially these days.",10,2,4,19 June 2010
Before Sunrise," One of the most thoughtful and honest romantic movies I've seen.
","I found Before Sunrise by chance when it was first released on video a few years ago.  Watching it then, I felt it was a well-written movie and an event that I would one day hope to experience myself.  Watching it now as a person in my young/mid twenties, I realize that I've experienced a feeling very similar to this movie: Being independent and actually falling in love.That experience was brief, honest, and fulfilling, leaving an impression on me that I'll always remember.  This film generates those same feelings for me, and watching this movie after my own experience, I can only see myself in Jesse's place, living out my own similar situations.This movie is one of the finest, most underappreciated (in my opinion) romantic stories of the '90's.  It's a very real movie, and it's an accurate portrayal of what it feels like to meet someone who you just instantly 'click' with.  No gripping score, no dramatic good-bye only to be 'surprise' reunited at the end.  Before Sunrise portrays all of its messages with the sincere awkwardness of a beginning relationship, a bit of insightful conversation, and two people with similar views and interests finding each other. Delpy and Hawke don't play stereotypes in this movie.  They play people, and that's what makes this film so interesting.  The pacing of the film is slow, yet time seems to rush by.  These are people you could actually meet.  These people could actually be you.When Before Sunrise ends, there's no contrived, cheesy good-bye, it just ends, which is how life works.  It leaves the possibilities open, but not in the way that you could see a sequel being made. If anyone has ever felt like this in a relationship, this movie will never ring truer than it does.  For those who have yet to find that bit of spontaneous adventure, Before Sunrise is a good guide of what to look for.I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  An intelligent, inspiring film.",10,2,4,26 August 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Unprecedented.
","Peter Jackson has done it.  He has created an all-encompassing epic saga of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books, and after coming away from the final chapter, how does this rate not only as a film on its own, but as a part of the whole?Perfect.I've never seen a series like this.  A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible?  I have always loved the original 'Star Wars' and 'Indiana Jones' series for their epic storytelling, and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. This should be, will be, remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come.  They do not make films like these anymore.As a stand alone film, it picks up immediately where 'Two Towers' ends, so brush up before seeing it.  I've read the books, and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective.  I wanted to make sure everything in this film was done 'right'.  And when it happened, it was.  I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level.The cast comes through once more.  The musical score retains its beauty, elegance and power.  The special effects, notably Gollum again, are nothing less than breathtaking, and simply move the story along.  The battles are monumentally huge and exciting.  There are some liberties taken with the story, especially during the end with the homecoming, and yet, everything that needed to be covered regarding the main characters was handled. After the greatest moment of the series resolves itself, the story provided a breather.  And gives a good-bye to friends seen on screen for the last three years.  It was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will be no 'Rings' movie in 2004.  I will miss this talented group of actors.As with the first two, the film is very long, but goes by without you ever truly realizing it.  This film is so much more than a simple 'fantasy' epic. It's a story about strength of character, friendship, loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play, I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. It's his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory.  Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic.  As as far as the ending goes, they ended it the way that it had to be ended. Jackson ended this film the way it should have been.I will miss looking forward to a new 'Rings' movie, but these movies provide hope that high-quality films can still be made without special effects taking over a story, bathroom humor, or a 'Top 40' soundtrack.  George Lucas could learn a lot from these films about how not to alienate the fanbase.Each film has earned a '10' from me for the last two years, which for me to give is a rarity.  This one, however, is as equally deserving as its two predecessors.  The Academy had better not look over this film for 'Best Picture' of 2003.  To do so would be greatly disrespectful of the craft and care that anyone involved with these films put into them.",10,1201,1404,17 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of my favorite all-time films.
","What's to say that hasn't already been said?  I love this film.  I love practically everything about it.  Of course, I grew up with this movie, so it represents a lot of my childhood and the fun that I had with it.  The characters are like old friends to me, and the story has always been one of my favorites.What I like most about the movie are the characters.  A lot of people have criticized some of the actor's abilities, but looking back on it, I don't think the movie would have been as memorable without the character dynamic that it had.  No one else could have been Luke Skywalker.  No one else could have been Han Solo or Princess Leia or C-3PO.  The music is both gorgeous and rousing at the times that it needs to be.  John Williams is by far one of the best cinema composers, and this remains one of his finest works.The sets are great, giving a sense of the alien worlds that Lucas wanted to convey, and this film has its share of moments that work so well.  My favorite scene of this movie features Luke watching at the twin suns of Tatooine set, frustrated that he's not going anywhere or doing anything with his life after yet another argument with his Uncle.  This small, quiet scene, accompanied only by Williams' score speaks worlds in those few moments than most movies do.  It's testament that special effects and CG can't replace the powerful simplicity of human emotion.All of the elements of Star Wars work so well together that it's hard to point out just one positive thing about this movie.  It's a film that if you haven't seen (if so, how has living on that deserted island been), you need to.  This is one of Lucas' finest achievements without compare.I have to rate this movie twice.  The 1977 version is easily a 9.  The 1997 re-release loses points because I think the new CG effects actually take away from the story.  I absolutely loathe the revised Han Solo/Greedo shoot-out scene.  It looks cheap and unrealistic, and Greedo must be pathetic if he can't kill someone from across a small table.  This version gets a 7 based on overall blasphemy of a movie that had nothing wrong with it in the first place.  It should have been cleaned up and nothing more.Well, at least Jar Jar Binks wasn't added to this one.",9,0,0,12 August 1999
Cube," Clever and Inventive.
","I was just introduced to 'The Cube', a low budget sci-fi film that had so much more to say than the standard sci-fi films that are put out recently. It's actually a relief to find a story with something to say other than total reliance on pretty CG eye candy.'The Cube' tells the story of a group of what essentially are prisoners trapped in an hi-tech deathtrap for no apparent reason, by no explainable jailer. And in that same explanation, the purpose behind the cube becomes apparent: It does serve a purpose, whether it is merely to entertain the psychopathic whims of a person/corporation with too much time and money or their hands, or an experiment designed to foster the breakdown of basic decency in humankind, and bring out the worst in people. Despite all the numerous and gruesome traps in each smaller cube, they prove to be the least of the threats within.The story can be taken with a lot of meanings. Some literal, some double, and some are never explained at all. Some story aspects, like the Cube itself, just ARE. And instead of feeling like the story was underdeveloped, or shortchanged by the need of more explanation, you're left with a sense of curiosity as to what really happened to bring all of these characters and factors together. Just when the viewer thinks it understands something, the story, like the cube itself, changes and becomes deeper.All in all, 'The Cube' was a fascinating film. I understand that it's followed by two sequels, and I'll be approaching them wondering if they'll add on or take away from the simplistic intrigue of this movie. But as a stand alone film, 'The Cube' will definitely have you talking. And thinking.And it's good to see a film like that again.",8,4,7,11 March 2007
Tarzan," Tarzan returns to the 'classic' Disney feel.
","Everyone has their favorite Disney film(s).  From more of the classic movies (Lady and the Tramp, Sleeping Beauty) to the newer films (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Lion King), I've had more of my share.  I had better find a space in there for Tarzan.Tarzan, simply put, was amazing.  The animation was the usual Disney quality (top-notch), the story didn't wander as far off track as some of the other films, and Tarzan and Jane were great characters.  Minnie Driver's slightly scatterbrained twist on Jane made for a very enjoyable character, and Tarzan 'surfing' through the trees and his fascination with the human world made for one of the best depictions of the character I've seen (I'm so glad they didn't use the 'Me Tarzan, you Jane' cliche).  I was also impressed on how well they handled the death issues in the movie.  The subject wasn't dropped halfway through the film, but it wasn't constantly focused on, and what little was seen was brief. Tarzan was a beautiful film to watch, and though many seem to criticize Phil Collins' singing, I didn't have a problem with it.  I found myself wishing that the film would have gone on longer than it had.My only complaint?  I found Clayton to be too much of the stereotypical 'bad guy'.  Sure, he was the kind of character that you could 'boo' at through the film, but I would have liked to have seen more depth to him.  I don't see him joining the 'Great Disney Villain' pantheon anytime soon.Even if you've been 'burned' by past Disney films, this is one to see, and will easily find its place in my movie collection.  Highly recommended.",9,1,1,7 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," This film goes well beyond sci-fi. A true cinematic masterpiece.
","The Empire Strikes Back represents everything that I've come to expect from a film: Brave heroes, menacing villains, a well-written story, fantastic action scenes, a strong supporting cast, drama, romance, surprises, and a beautiful musical score. 'Empire' focuses heavily on developing the characters from the first film, rounding out their personalities, and introduces several great new characters (Yoda, Lando Calrissian, Boba Fett). The special effects still hold up well to today's standards, the dialogue is witty and intelligent, and the character dynamic allows the actors to play well off of each other. It's a very different kind of film in that the 'good guys always win' theory is proved wrong, and Darth Vader's surprise revelation at the end of the movie is still one of the best movie moments ever, which was shocking for its time. This is one of the few films that I find that never diminishes after each viewing. Even without the 'Star Wars' name behind it, the amount of movie 'magic' this film generates captivates me just as much now as it did when I was a child. This is a prime example of cinematic perfection, and in no way should be missed by anyone. A true classic and worthy of the '10' that I gave it.",10,1,2,18 June 1999
Princess Mononoke," A True Masterpiece of Animation.
","I simply wasn't prepared for this film.  I honestly can't remember seeing a recent animated film that has swept me away like this movie did.  Actually, disregarding the fact that this is an animated film, this is one of the best movies that I've seen in quite a while.For some reason, I kept looking for a reason to be disappointed, but I couldn't.  Some flaw.  Some story element that just didn't click.  But it never happened.  The animation is incredibly fluid and conveys with an incredible amount of detail the personalities of the main characters.  The musical score is gorgeous, ranking up there with some of John Williams and James Horner's best works.  Neil Gaiman's translation is intelligent and natural sounding, and the voice acting is excellent.  It's not as quite as bloody as some people would have you believe, but it does have its fair share of violence.  Actually, the only thing I found strange was Billy Bob Thornton's voice and the look of Jigo.  The voice just didn't match the face.  But that's not to say Thornton gave a bad performance. If this film is overlooked as just an 'animated film', then  it's a true loss on the critics' parts.  It deserves a chance at 'Best Foreign Film' or even 'Best Picture'.  This is a beautiful fantasy epic, and it's understandable why this was Japan's big money-maker.  I'm really pleased that Miramax/Disney brought this movie to America with the care that they did.  I hope to see more, and I can't wait until the DVD comes out. Recommended to fans of fantasy, animation, or people who just enjoy a quality movie.",10,0,1,17 November 1999
Jurassic Park," An Excellent Special Effects Thrill Ride
","I remember seeing Jurassic Park back when it was first released in theaters with the booming THX sound and big screen.  It quickly became one of my favorite fantasy films of all time, and still remains so today. 
While it takes several artistic liberties from the book, it has a great cast, a wonderful musical score (Courtesy of the ever-talented John Williams), and the special effects still hold up as well today as they did when it was released nearly 7 years ago.Jurassic Park is a movie to be savored, like 'Star Wars' or 'Indiana Jones'. It's one excellent non-stop thrill after another that can only be described as fun.  The introduction of the T-Rex is still one of the most memorable scenes in the entire film, and the raptors were just relentless.  I don't think the dinosaurs would have been nearly as frightening if they were just 'monsters'.  The fact that these creatures behaved like instinct-driven animals kept the tension factor high.My only complaint?  I wish that the 'Lost World' sequel had been as good to keep the thrills up past this film.  At least Jurassic Park didn't have as many drastic changes made to it like the sequel.  Overall, another excellent Steven Spielberg film.",8,2,4,28 October 1999
