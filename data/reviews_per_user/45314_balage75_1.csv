Deja Vu," One of the worst movies I've ever seen
","I am sorry to write that this was a very very awful movie, full of stereotypes and self-contradictions. It was a real disappointment for me. Why is that a director and/or the scriptwriter lets things happen in a movie as things happen in this movie: inconsistent, illogical? Why is that if someone wants to play with the time-flow, he is so unprepared. This movie is one of the worst movies playing with the time. Maybe the director should have watched e.g. 12 Monkeys (at least once) to learn how to make a good and consistent story when changing the timeline.I recommend this movie only for those people who would like to see an (below) average B-movie, but not for those people who are irritated by huge mistakes in scripts.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERJust a few questions that arose in my head during the movie, but cannot be answered in a logical of life-like, realistic way:1. I don't want to mention the fact that the main 'axis' of the movie (ie the time-vision or rather past-vision machine) is contrary to the laws of physics itself. Not in this film, OK. But above that it is unclear: if you cannot send back any thing to the past (the experts said), how was it possible to send back that slip of paper with the notes? OK, the crew finally managed it: they put the paper in the appropriate chamber and transported it back. Then our hero, Doug wanted to jump back in time. He climbed into the chamber (he was allowed tho wear some clothes, that means, the machine transports not only the body, but also other materials on it, but not the gun, of course!) and jumped back in time. Of course he made it! But how could he change the past pointing simply with his laser pointer on a simple screen (ie not through the chamber!)??? How was it possible?2. The mobile past-vision machine was so complicated that only one member of the crew was able to handle it. Maybe he was the only one who could drive a car or who could turn a simple button on and off! (That was the only thing Doug had to do with it!)3. Then Doug took the ambulance and crashed into the building with Claire and the bad guy in it. He was lucky enough not to run over Claire lying on the floor totally bound and spilled over with gasoline. Then he took her body and jumped out of the building successfully even after the whole building exploded. It didn't matter that Claires clothes were totally wet of gasoline and she should have caught fire from the smallest spark (or the charming eyes of Doug) and should have burnt like hell.4. After getting back to her apartment she should have smelled like a gas station very likely but that was not disturbing because she didn't even take a shower and didn't want to change her clothes.5. Of course this was the most simple way for Doug (who was shot) to drive to the ferry and hinder the crime himself instead of dialing 911 and reporting 2 simple things: there is a car full of explosives on a ferry, and the perpetrator is watching it from a bridge nearby.6. Women kidnapped by a terrorist, then freed by a strange policeman (driving an ambulance instead of a car) always want to kiss the policeman after knowing him only for 2 hours.7. Confused women mentioned before who escape from a sunken car (and leaving behind a policeman) are not surprised even a bit when the smiling double-ganger of the fellow appears in front of them.It's only a fraction of the questions I would like to ask from the movie makers (who made this terrible thing called movie). It is possible that I am the only one who wants to see an action movie with a real, life-like hero.",3,10,17,18 January 2007
