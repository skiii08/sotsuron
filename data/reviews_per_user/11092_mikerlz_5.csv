Black Swan," Black Swan is an embarrassment to Darren Aronofsky's career.
","I am so disappointed in Darren Aronofsky for making this trash. I am a HUGE fan of the rest of his work. I have not had a chance to see The Wrestler yet, but I absolutely loved Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and The Fountain. I consider him the best director out there in modern filmmaking, but I have no idea how he could come up with such a worthless piece of garbage as Black Swan.This movie tries to portray itself as profound, shocking, and original. Well it's definitely shocking. Shockingly bad! I'm not sure where to begin with this one. I guess my main gripe would have to be the way that Portman's character begins her downward spiral from situations that really are just not that huge of a deal. There is simply nothing that happens to her that even remotely could justify such a steep fall from grace.This movie is also mind-numbingly boring. Not much ever really happens here at all, but Aronofsky still managed to drag it out to nearly 2 hours. The whole plot line could have been fully explored in literally 30 or 40 minutes. I hate to say it, but it seems to me that he is simply starting to run out of ideas. That said, every great director has both good and bad movies and I guess it was his time to make his first flop. Hopefully he's back to his usual talented self with his next project.My next complaint would be that Portman's acting is painfully flat. If her performance was more convincing, the movie MIGHT have been a decent watch regardless of the other huge flaws. She has one expression on her face through the entire movie! The delivery of her lines is so quiet, and devoid of any conviction whatsoever. She isn't remotely believable as Nina Sayers.The supporting cast (specifically Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, and Barbara Hershey) utterly and completely blew Natalie Portman away. Portman in the lead might be the worst casting choice that I have EVER seen.Next, we've got the utterly pointless and unnecessary 'sex' scenes. I love a good, well-done sex scene when called for in a film but the ones in Black Swan were the exact opposite of that description. They were bad, poorly done, and totally uncalled for. The out-of-place gory scenes were also ridiculously over-the-top and out of place here. I guess they are here to help keep a viewer's attention? There certainly isn't anything else interesting in this film.Last, but certainly not least, we have the unapologetically blatant rip off of the good/evil schizophrenic duality in Nina from Fight Club. Kunis is Portman's hallucination of her own evil side, EXACTLY as Pitt's character was to Norton's. (and Cassel is basically the Marla Singer role) The difference is that Fight Club (which I didn't even really care much for) handled this aspect of the plot infinitely better than Black Swan did.Basically, Black Swan is a pompous, trashy, derivative, and ultimately boring piece of cinematic fluff that takes itself far too seriously. You couldn't pay me to watch it again. Darren Aronofsky, what the hell happened?! How could you go from making such an utterly brilliant, innovative, deep and beautiful work of art as The Fountain to this pile of dung in Black Swan??Please Darren, take a year or two off. Go on vacation somewhere for a while, then get back to your usual brilliant self. I'm amazed that you made such a terrible flick. I think I am going to go out later tonight to rent The Wrestler and hope it's better than this, simply because I would hate for Black Swan to leave such a bad taste in my mouth as the most recent Aronofsky movie I've watched. He is SO much better than this. I can't emphasize enough just how amazed I am that he would release Black Swan.",1,25,41,5 September 2012
Oblivion," Great sci-fi flick, but a bit derivative.
","Are there some plot holes? Sure. Is much of the plot ripped from other movies? Sure, but whatever. They did a very good job with it. It's an enjoyable sci-fi film, one of the best I've seen in a while. There aren't a lot of good ones coming out these days.I also wanted to point out one thing that particularly bugged me at the end. Cruise's character had a decent little speech he made to Sally before detonating the nuke, which I liked but then all of sudden right before pressing the button... he RUINED it with a seriously cheesy line...'F*ck you, Sally.' Really? And he was doing so well until that. Oh well. Overall, a great entertaining sci-fi with some fantastic cinematography.",7,2,3,10 October 2013
Children of Men," Worst movie I have ever seen without question. Vote fraud?
","I was having a glance through the top rated sci-fi (turns out this isn't sci-fi in any way actually) movies here on IMDb to find something good to spend a couple of hours on. This had a very high score, and the premise of global infertility intrigued me. I read a few reviews and it sounded solid.After considering some of them again after actually seeing this abortion of a movie, I've concluded that the ONLY answer to such a high number of beaming reviews with 9 and 10 stars is vote fraud by the studio. I'm not the only one who thought the same after watching this one. Check some of the other 'hated it' reviews. Many of them believe the same.There have been times when I have suspected this in the past, but thought I was just being paranoid. Well, this one leaves me with no doubt that it happens. IMDb, please do something to fix this. This is the fourth movie in a row I've watched after seeing it in the top 250 that has turned out to be COMPLETE crap. What's going on?? This is easily the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune of viewing.There is NO discernible plot, and I mean that. It's nothing but contrived dialog to take us from one dreary scene to the next. Literally nothing that is happening has any reason or explanation. The acting is high-school drama class level from nearly everyone. There is not one likable character. Hell, the first line spoken by the supposed savior of humanity (how is she that again?? never explained.) was 'what the f*ck are you staring at?' Garbage from beginning to end.What annoyed me the most is that the interesting premise of this global infertility is COMPLETELY unexplained. The ONLY way it is addressed in the film is establishing that it exists. Nobody has the slightly clue why, and figuring it out is never pursued by anybody. This is the result of nothing but lazy writing. They didn't even care about this supposed premise.Avoid, avoid, AVOID!!! The IMDb score is mind-bendingly unbelievable.",1,4,8,26 September 2013
Jack Reacher," Entertaining enough, but pretty much a standard cliché action flick.
","I watched this one tonight on Netflix. It was an enjoyable waste of time, but if you're looking for something deep or requiring a modicum of thought... go elsewhere. This was loaded was clichés like the obligatory car chase. Tom Cruise evades the police in a classic 70's muscle car. (Camaro SS... gotta admit it was pretty bad ass car, which he unfortunately ended up destroying; yet another action movie cliché)Basically Tom Cruise is a bigger badass than everybody else, and is a way better investigator than any other cop on the case. Oh, don't forget the crooked-cop-who-is-really-working-with-the-bad-guys cliché. The whole movie is designed make Cruise look like the biggest badass on the planet, pretty much.Despite of all of this, I have to admit I actually kind of enjoyed the movie. I didn't go in expecting a masterpiece, so it didn't disappoint. Definitely better than anything with Jason Statham or Bruce Willis, at least. If you want a film where you can just chow down on a bowl of popcorn, turn off your brain, slam a few shots of vodka and have a good time... well, then give Jack Reacher a chance.",6,1,4,20 January 2014
Army of Darkness," Complete garbage. Don't waste your time.
","How in the hell this movie has managed to get this rating here on IMDb is beyond me. It began decently enough. It had some pretty funny bits so I kept watching, but once Ash's 'quest' began it just got too stupid. I had to stop watching. It just began to fall apart. It was getting too over-the-top, and no longer funny. Just stupid.I know it's supposed to be tongue-in-cheek. I got that. It doesn't make the STUPID, slapstick jokes any better. This film just didn't work for me. I tried to give it chance, but at around the 40 minute point, I couldn't take any more. Quite easily the worst movie I've seen in many years.",1,6,16,23 June 2013
