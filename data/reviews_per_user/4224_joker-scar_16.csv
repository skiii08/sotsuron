Sucker Punch," SUCKER PUNCH....Boring visual extravaganza...
","Ok. It seems I might be alone in this but I hung on for nearly an hour squirming in my seat waiting to 'get into' this film. At the 1 hour mark I decided, what I've seen so far is all I'm gonna get outta this flick and walked out. An over pumped CG filled film where the music comes in and out like an auditory Jar Jar Binks. I loved 300 but realized in the hands of a lesser director it would have been a hollow action film with uber faux intensity. On that film Zak Synder walked the razors edge and delivered a fresh twist on an old story. I liked what he did with Watchmen. This latest film is what is wrong with directors who watch too many music videos. Maybe it's just me...I don't know. Is he a One Trick Pony? Who else out there feels the same??????",1,3,9,21 August 2018
Fury," For those who feast on comic-book violence, a much welcome wake-up call
","I gave this film a 10 not because it is a great and satisfying narrative film that one would watch over and over but for what it accomplishes. This film is not plot driven, it doesn't need to be as it accomplishes all it set out to do. No punches are pulled in this one. This is an intense character study of mankind's brutality against his own. This is 'probably' why this film got poor reviews because it doesn't have a plot and the standard Hollywood satisfying ending. It is gut wrenchingly truthful and most people don't want to watch films like this, reminding us how shit the world and humans are. But humans have short memories and they need to be reminded of history. This kind of film is very hard to do, many others have attempted this theme, some succeed but many fall short, not to a lack of trying. To sustain an audiences attention while hammering home its theme is a careful walk along a razors edge. Too much one way or the other and the viewer will tune out. Very few of this generation will have the patience to watch older films like ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, PATHES OF GLORY or other such B&W classics, but hopefully they will watch this film because of Brad or the war aspect. Whatever drives them to watch this film is a means to an end. Super hero and cartoon violence has its place and are escapist for sure, but too much of that will convince growing minds that that is what war and violence is, this film is a rude awakening to that juvenile thought process. Fury is one of those films that should be shown in schools, watching a film like this and similar films based on real-life drama, is worth more than reading a hundred books on the subject. History is not dead, it should be re-booted as often as possible to remind the younger generation that the world they live in has not always been this way and simply taken for granted that it has. As much as my life revolves around film, I know life is not a movie. I know the difference. Those that don't, are in for their own rude awakening at some point in their lives. This film reminds them that peace and freedom has the highest price.",10,0,3,9 September 2018
Darkest Hour," NOT Winston's FINEST HOUR...
","I had high hopes for this film for many reasons, I am a history buff, especially the 2nd world war era, I love biographies and famous people's own struggles in life that get them to their respective accomplishments and....the main reason. I thought FINALLY... the Gary Oldman of old has found a juicy part to sink his teeth into rather than the pedestrian roles like Commissioner Gordon. The film has fine moments in it, like the beginning montage of vintage B&W stock footage that people who watch history docs have seen hundreds of times but the treatment of it with the subliminal music instead of the clichÃ© harsh drum-beat score really drew me in. Great photography, great sets/locations and then enter Mr. Churchill. Or more to the point, Gary Oldman's 'interpretation' of the British Conservative bulldog.
 In every film of this nature when either a well known actor or unknown plays a famous figure from history there is always 'that moment' when he/she is first seen on CAMERA and we, whether conscious or un, judge whether they 'are' that person, the look and then when they speak the voice. The problem with doing bio-pic's of famous people like Kennedy, James Dean, Elvis, etc... they are all part of the 20th century and we all know what they look and sound like. In this case they are all unique in both those respects. Daniel Day Lewis pretty much 'nailed' Lincoln (well, in my mind) Nobody knows exactly how the great Emancipator really sounded because it was before recorded sound. We only have photos and written accounts so it is easier to smudge some details and few would know. Bruce Greenwood nailed the 'essence' of Jack Kennedy even though he did not really resemble him and Anthony Hopkins looks NOTHING like Richard Nixon but his acting over came those hurtles and you believe he is Nixon. Oldman's own portrayal of Beethoven is amazing and I have seen JFK at least 20 times and I still think his portrayal of Oswald is nothing less than stunning/frightening.
With someone like Churchill he not only had the unique look but the sound of his voice to identify him. When I saw Mr. Oldman, I thought he looked pretty good on screen. I never read any spoilers before I saw this film, (I never do anymore) but I 'assumed' (my fault totally) that he had done the whole method actor thing and gained the weight a la' De Niro. But it was make-up and padding. No problem, totally understandable and in this day of high tech make-up you can get away with a lot more than in the old days. As the movie progressed Gary's eyes were not Churchill's, they were his and that kept me from getting into the movie and letting myself watch Churchill and not Gary Oldman acting as the great man. Then there was the voice... this problem could have easily been 'adjusted' to make him sound a little more like the real man. This to me was the biggest problem with the portrayal, Churchill had a voice of gravelly meat-and-potatoes, of gravitas, of weight and authority...which Oldman did not bring to the roll. The facial make-up would not have distracted me if the voice was closer to the real man's but by now I am being critical to every mistake instead of being sucked into the viewing experience. The voice was weak...pure and simple. If I were a British citizen hearing Gary Oldman's voice in 1940 trying to rouse me to fight the Hun, I doubt Churchill would be remembered as strongly by history. The real man, JUST hearing his voice has a strength that inspires one to be and give more than you think you have within you. A true leaders voice...not so with Oldman's voice treatment. It sounds like a kindly old man working in an antique book shop. A man who you can trust but hardly inspiring to put one's life on the line for him or anyone else for that matter. Either the director was happy with it OR more likely, he didn't want to press the matter due to social/artistic awkwardness.
Another problem, a small nit-pick one I grant you, when Oldman walked it seemed to have the weight of his own and not one of a man with more girth to his mid rift. 
I am not one to point out CG work unless it really stands out as great...or...lame. Most of the shots of CG planes looked like CG planes...fake. The completely 'fake' and contemporary shots of being on Churchill, him looking up from the roof and the CAMERA PULLS up into the sky to reveal passing bombers is not of the same tone as the rest of the film. That is a very 21st century film 'gimmick' and took both myself and my friend out of the film once again. The rest of the film had the proper pace and tone of its subject matter and then here comes a CG grand standing shot to show the head office where some of the budget was spent... or wasted. Wrong, wrong, wrong! Establish a tone and stick with it, this is basic 101 directing stuff. 
I really 'wanted' to like it BUT I like it even less the day after. This review would have been kinder if I had written it last night...",6,4,17,28 December 2017
The Maze Runner," Running on empty...
","I saw this trailer and it totally turned me off from seeing it. 2 years later and now it is on Netflix so...hey why not I've already paid the monthly fee. This film is a typical teenage-hero-fantasy plot..and as with teenagers has no real logic or sense. I can go on and on about faulty plot, characters, cliché's, etc. but others have already pointed those out in previous reviews. 5 minutes into this film I thought that if this 'maze' is not a mental construct and is actually a real construction, then it is stupid from the get go. In this 'destroyed ' earth how could anyone build such a maze, a vastly expensive...in material, time AND labor, it is simply impossible. It would be a billion dollar, 20 year endeavor in a fully functional and working society let alone a devastated planet. Every movie must have its rules, no matter how far fetched or fantasy based, this plot hole alone is clearly lazy writing. Also, this is the first film and it should, even though it is a 'series', should still end on a satisfying note as the end just like any other single film regardless, but it ends on a cliffhanger which equals it being a total whore to a sequel. Even STAR WARS can be seen as a separate film without watching the rest BUT this film is a total tease to watch the next one. No thanks...rather stick a pencil in my eye.",1,2,2,12 March 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Star Woes...
","Most reviews on this site I basically agree with so I won't repeat that stuff. I liked it but was not engaged like I wanted to be. I will nit-pick on stuff that took me out of the film. Simple logic problems that could have easily been avoided if someone took the time probably the director. 1. This has nothing to do with the film itself but we were exposed to 11 commercials and then only 3 trailers, all of which were high concept sequels AND then to yet another commercial for Cineplex before the film started. When did this become the norm? Yikes. 2. when the shuttle lands to pick up Galen and fam they land a mile awayfor no reason other than the Imperials on board need the exercise I suppose. 3. when the X-Wings attack the base where Galen and the Scientists are held, the shuttle that is on the landing pad between them and the attacking fighters, is not hit or destroyed even though it is a huge target. I am sure if it was hit in the right place it would produce a cool fire ball and explosion. If I were one of the Rebel pilots that would be my first thought of attack. But I guess they don't teach that in Rebel fighter school. 4. I have no qualms with a female hero or one that is sexy, pretty much a given within the film world for the past 100+ years but aren't we sick of 'heroes' who can fight better/stronger/faster than any living human being? Uber choreographed fights that would make Bruce Lee's head spin? I am. At least Bruce could do the things he did on film, not so for 99% of these actors who seem to be doing it on a never ending basis in every other film released in the past 20 years. I can't sympathize with a hero who does super human feats and isn't a super hero. I can barely stand it when a super hero does it. 5. The rebel Blockade runner which rams into the Star Destroyer to push it to the other Star Destroyer; it seems the head of the blockade Runner is made of solid metal and suffers minor damage when colliding into the behemoth, yet both Star Destroyers seem to crumble like crackers when they collide at the same speed with each other. Maybe they were built by the lowest bid contractor and instead of metal substituted plywood instead to cut costs better spent on the Death Star. 6. A lot of people are jumping on the CG Tarkin and Leiayeah they aren't perfect but since everyone KNOWS that both are dead (or even those that saw the film before Carrie passed away knew it could not be her 19 year old self), we are naturally focused on scrutinizing the effects, just as I was even though I knew they were coming up in the film. It's better to have them in and flawed than to totally eliminate them from the story. Either way you can't win. I am sure there are many more but those are ones that jumped out at me upon fist viewing.",10,0,7,3 January 2017
Suicide Squad," DIRTY (half) DOZEN....
","There is NOTHING original about this film. The writer/director took the plot from THE DIRTY DOZEN and superhero-ed it up. 2 dimensional plot - 2 dimensional acting - 2 dimensional heroes - 2 dimensional dialogue - 2 dimensional directing - 2 dimensional villains -2 dimensional movie experience... it would be ironic if this film was presented in 3D, wouldn't it? 
This film used EVERY filmmaking beat-a-dead-horse cliche' in the book. The writer also used the formulaic Hollywood check list and used almost every one of them. BORING - BORING - BORING!
The 'only' thing that kept my interest was seeing how many shots Margot Robbie was seen walking away from CAMERA in her short-shorts and trying to spot which Toronto locations I could identify in the film. She is a fine actress and obviously had fun making the film. I also like Jared but try as he might, nothing can now come close to Heath's portrayal of the Joker. He set the standard...forever. I don't even want to get into Mr. Smith's portrayal...he continues to play by the Hollywood A-list actor ego handbook. Boring...",1,1,2,31 December 2017
The Shining," Chilling in more ways than one
","I remember my mom taking us to a drive-in to see this film upon original release but it was sold out and we were resolved to watch some 2nd rate National Lampoon comedy on the 3rd screen. While the rude/raunchy comedy entertained us, both me and my sister kept sneaking peaks at the Shining screen and mesmerized by the images sans sound. I've seen the film many times on video and really liked it but it wasn't until many repeated viewings on video increased my love of this film in the last few years. Even knowing what's coming up next doesn't take away from the viewing experience. Kubrick is still unmatched as a filmmaker. Never having read the book but hearing the changes made to the script, I can't imagine enjoying the book more than the film, but that's just me. Stephen King would argue that point. 
The film contains all the classic, if not cliché, elements in making a typical horror film but Kubrick, as always, puts his unique spin on things to make it refreshing on every single viewing elevating this far and above all the slasher horror films that came and went in the ensuing 80's and beyond.",8,1,4,17 September 2018
Zulu," Spears and blood
","I have always heard of this film since I was a kid and it was Peter Jackson's praising the film in the Lord of the Rings commentary that made me finally search out the film and watch it. Solid filming. Stream lined story of classic defenders vs. attackers scenario with the added element of treating the baddies (Zulus) as human beings and not just targets for the good guys to aim at. It does suffer from being a tad long, could have been tightened up in the editing room a little, not much, just a little.",7,1,3,17 September 2018
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," a dull ride through a great story
","I grew watching the original and have fond memories of it. I re-watched the original 1971 version a few years ago and the found it did not hold up in regards to the production value and photography clichés that were prevalent back in the late 60's and early 70's. Like so many things, memories are better left in the mind than the reality that exists on film. Having said that...I must say that the production value on the 2005 remake is better...but not much else. The dramatic story elements flat line in this remake. The moment where Charlie finds his Golden Ticket is so anti-climatic compared to the 1971 version that I jumped back on the DVD to see if I blinked and missed the moment. The sub-plot of the five children being approached by Wonka's competitor and bribing them to steal the Chocolate masters secrets is not there at all and it is sorely missed from the original. The elimination of the four other children, due to their character's short comings, is not as pronounced as in the original version. The main character, Charlie, is not 'tested' on his morals, like in the 71' version, except on one moment near the end of the film, except he does not change and become a hero, he just stays the same throughout which is boring, dramatically speaking. Then we come to Johnny Depps interpretation of the Willy Wonka character...Depp, always a fine actor in any genre, this time stumbles along in a weird, wimpy and effeminate Child-man version of Wonka that leaves this viewer wondering 'why'. I realize that any actor worth his salt as Depp is, would not tread on the same ground as another actor and simply mimic his performance, but to go 180 degrees the other way was not a wise choice. Gene Wilders 'Wonka' was dark, funny and wise, leading his five prospective heirs on a moral journey through self while Depp's 'Wonka' finds himself on a Oompa Loompa psychotherapist sofa pondering the scars of his childhood. I am a huge fan of Christopher Lee but seeing him in the clunky flashbacks of Wonkas childhood took me out of the film every time. All in all a very dull movie with no danger or tension at any turn. I'll stick to the corny 1971 production values that had strong performances and dramatic tension in the storyline and a much more satisfying ending.",1,4,6,2 February 2011
Once Upon a Time in America," A great gangster fable from the spaghetti-western Master
","The first time I saw this film was opening day in 1984. I liked his Clint westerns from the mid 60's and always love a good gangster film. All of us left the theatre 139 mins. later less than satisfied. Unfortunately we had no idea we had watched a completely butchered version of the film that jumped around too much and made little sense. We quickly forgot the experience and watched much more satisfying films for the rest of the summer popcorn infused flicks of the 1980's.
Years later the complete version finally surfaced with little fanfare. This film is one of those that gets better every time you watch it, 'if' one takes the time to sit down and really watch and absorb it.",8,1,5,17 September 2018
The Godfather: Part III," the much dreaded let-down scenerio
","Like many people I anticipated the arrival of Godfather 3 but was left cold by it. At the time I zeroed my dislike to the universally accepted scapegoat, Sofia Coppola's stale performance, after the talented Winona Ryder bailed on the project. After multiple viewings I suddenly realized that, for me anyway, Al Pacino's performance is what turned me off. He was not the younger, subtle and starving artist Pacino of the early 1970's as in the first two films, but the older super-star whose strong acting style had already by 1990, become a parody of itself.",7,0,1,17 September 2018
A Hard Day's Night," A Hard act to follow
","Wow! This film still holds up. The energy, the pace, The Beatles! This film totally captures the essence of Beatlemania. I was in the cradle when this was happening but watching the film you feel like you experienced it yourself personally, well the idea and promoted image of the group anyway. It works on every level and the word 'a light hearted romp' fits this film to a tee. Clever writing, and brilliant filmmaking and a far superior effort to the follow-up film, Help.",8,1,1,17 September 2018
Black Panther," Pale addition to Marvel universe....
","I saw the trailer for this latest addition to the Marvel universe, I wasn't impressed. A friend wanted to see it and I thought I would give it a shot. 
The director/writer pulled out the Marvel hero playbook/check list and stock piled all the clichéd traits/story plots for a 'compelling' story but as any 'good' cook knows, having the right ingredients doesn't guarantee a great meal. 
There are many fine actors in this piece, including Chadwick as the hero-guy. BUT, being a good actor doesn't mean you have the ability to carry a film as a lead. Hollywood of old used to call it the 'it' factor, a better word would be charisma. Jordan as the heavy does have the 'it' factor, which is not good for the film to have the villain with more than the hero.
This film was simply BORING. Half way through I felt relief because I thought we were nearing the end, but it was when the hero was seemingly defeated so I was painfully reminded we were only in the last half of the 2nd act. ARG! 
I was not engaged with the characters, except the villains. Bad for the audience and the film. Lots of moments for emotional peaks in the story that some how fall short... thus unsatisfying. The 'humour' falls flat. I am sure an actor with the proven chops of a Robert Downey could have made them work but in the hands of the director the actors did not seem to reach their full potential. Forest Whitaker gave a very over the top performance, a sin for any actor, getting caught at acting. 
I could go on and on with trivial bits of annoyance like lines spoken as there being no better sunsets as seen in the hero's isolationist nation... I guess a sunset off the Fiji coast pales by comparison???",2,84,183,24 February 2018
The Nice Guys," 70's hi-jinks...
","Once again Shane Black delivers his brand of kooky well timed humour with a solid plot and characters. Younger viewers may not get all the references but for someone who lived through the 70's, albeit as a kid, it brought back many a memory. 
Unfortunately, this kind of film needs a somewhat large budget to re-create that era and since it's not a teen sex comedy or one with the current trend of comedy actors doing their shtick, it doesn't draw in the big crowds Hollywood brass hunger for to declare it a 'hit'. Like Black's previous similar buddy-buddy comedy, KISS KISS BANG BANG, this kind of film picks up speed audience wise in the secondary market like Netflix, etc. and becomes a 'cult' classic. 
It is well worth the viewing....",8,0,1,15 April 2018
Valkyrie," Yes it stars Tom Cruise, but watch it anyway...
","I knew about this real story two decades before the film was made so I knew a lot going in and was dreading in the back of my mind what they would 'alter' for the movie and or to suit Mr. Cruise's ego and team of image consultants that he has employed since the start of his career in the early 1980's. Yes ladies he's 'that' old. But I must say it was done very historically correct and yes Mr. Cruise fit himself in the real life character of Stauffenberg rather than 'tweek' and leave out stuff, character wise for him to still pull off the movie star image he loves to protect and cultivate. Did I see 'cult' in that last word...hum?
Any-who, this is one of the best interpretations of that event of July 20th 1944 that tried to kill Adolf Hitler and end World War 2 in the European theatre of war then and there. Many other films have included this day of attempted assassination since the 1950's and many have handled it very well. But this is the whole story, well most of the story, of that day and nights events that can be squeezed into a 2 hour film.",8,0,0,17 September 2018
The Godfather," Unquestioned masterpiece of 70's cinema
","I am not going to get into extensive detail on how great this film is, hundreds if not thousands before me have already done so and to good credit. As a Hollywood director has once previously stated on another non-Godfather film commentary track, watching the film is a cinema class in of its self... if you are going to watch only one film in your life, it is this one. I must agree, I watch this film repeatedly, not only to be entertained but also to study as a filmmaker myself. 
Obviously the many directors who turned down the assignment to direct this adapted script had a strong moral objection to glorify the mafia, and I agree, there is absolutely 'nothing' glamorous about real life gangsters in organized crime. But this is a fictional tale and Coppola used his own strong Italian American heritage to infuse the film with far greater themes and family bonding than any of the other directors originally approached would have done. He raised this film from the exploitative gangster flick that it was slotted to be by the studio, even wanting to change the novel's 1940's setting to modern day to save money on the budget, to that of Shakespearian levels and the best example of film art in Hollywood films. Coppola well deserved the Oscar, fame and the money that followed the film's release, in my opinion anyway.
Perhaps it is because I saw this film as a youngster and accepted the film as is, as many others I watched, good and cheesy, but watching it even now there doesn't seem to be a single bad shot or angle in the entire film, except one.... Diane Keaton's false 'double-take' reaction to the exploded vehicle in the back ground when she is confronted by Tom as she returns to the Mall to see Michael. It always takes me out of the film.",10,0,1,17 September 2018
