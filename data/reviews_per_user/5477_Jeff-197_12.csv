Vertigo," If oil-paintings came in video format...
","... this is what you'd get.  I can't watch it enough.  It's beautiful. Nobody ever used a camera like Hitch.  Makes you realize how cheap modern films are.  They do so much less with so much more (with exception to acting talent).Every time I watch, I see something new.  This should be required in school, like the Constitution tests.",10,1,2,16 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I agree with Silent Bob - this was weak
","Everyone else seems to have already said my opinion, so I'll just run it down real quick: 1-Acting is cold and sterile 2-Too many direct parellels to other Star Wars (e.g., Jedi dying in front of student, escaping large animal in ship) 3-special effects look cartoonish, like 'A Bug's Life'.  Lucas and his crew spent hundreds of Million to prove that computer graphics still aren't as lifelike as shooting real-life miniature models on film (like the other films). 4-Jar Jar 5-I STILL don't have a real good grasp of what the hell is going on 6-75% of the film seemed to be a Pod race 7-Anakin making C3PO is hokey 8-The force being something of a microbe, a physical entity in the body, blows it for me.  I liked to think of it as a sort of Zen-like concept, an Eastern-religion feel.  Let go of your normal consciousness and let 'the force' take over.  It was mystical, supernatural.  Now it is a bacteria. Not quite as romantic.I sincerely hope that Episode 2 and 3 are more thought out.",3,0,1,10 October 2001
Meet the Parents," There's Something About Mary for the over-40 crowd
","Total crap.  One more 'Focker' joke and this juvenile slapstick would've made me leave.  All the boomers in the theater seemed to find it hillarious, even after the 11th time, though. This movie was like a rerun of I love Lucy.  Things go implausibly wrong, then turn worse as the lead character tries to fix them. Ha.",1,4,6,10 October 2001
Shakespeare in Love," Just another way to do R&J
","The film is indeed a creative way to do Romeo and Juliet, but many viewers may see it as just that... another Romeo and Juliet.  Indeed, the most emotional parts of the film are the direct quotes from Shakespeare's work. The rest seems almost like filler. Paltrow, Affleck, and others have commented on how 'historically accurate' the film is.  This seems to be true for the costume and set design, however, major historical mistakes seem to be evident.  For example, Jamestown, Virginia (the first settlement in Virginia) wasn't founded until 1607, some years after Shakespeare wrote R&J (ca.1595).  Even if this estimation is incorrect, Shakespeare would have to have been at least 43 when Virginia was colonized, much older than the young star of the film.Also notable is the effort made to darken the Queen's teeth, showing how poor hygiene technology was.  However, all the 'main' characters have pearly whites. This condensing of time, and other factors made me feel that I was just watching another rendition of Romeo and Juliet, done yet another way. Television film critics have recently commented on the trend of modernizing Shakespeare, a trend I feel is unnecessary.",Null,0,1,2 April 1999
Cast Away," spoon-feeding you pseudointellectual fluff
","This movie is the dumbest thing ever. If you are under 40 years of age, and are not currently experiencing a mid-life crisis, skip it. The message - too simple.  We know that materialism is bad.  I have a degree in Sociology, so maybe it was a little too remedial for me, but come on, aren't we all a little beyond this simple a life lesson?  Unless you are a yuppie and are currently also on your cell phone, this movie will not enlighten you. The acting - too bad.  Helen Hunt CANNOT ACT.  Hello, Hollywood?  Are you reading this?  SHE CANNOT ACT!  (SPOILERS)She shows no emotion when he comes back, when she says she cannot take him back, nothing.  And the plot that she would not try to take him back is totally unsupported (since the creators thought we needed to see 45 minutes of footage of him trying to open a stupid coconut instead of developing her character, who only has about 5 minutes of screen time).The movie will not surprise you ever.  Everything... everything is foreshadowed!  The film is as dry as toast.  And spoon-fed.  Did we need to see him play with the lighter to realize how much we take fire for granted? WASN'T THE 30 MINUTES OF FOOTAGE OF HIM RUBBING STICKS ENOUGH?And why on earth did he keep that package?  The 5 year-old in front of me asked out loud 'HOW did it save his life', and the whole section turned to their partners and whispered, 'yeah, how DID it save his life?'The film was too cute, too perfect, and had a warmed over 'you never know what the tide will bring in... maybe a box of chocolates' type moral.  Gee, thanks, I hadn't considered that.I still cannot believe that they had to 'go there' and make a 'happy' ending where he finds some new woman.  In fact, the romantic subplot altogether seemed incomplete, undeveloped, secondary, and just added in because the executives' formulas say that movies need a romantic sub-plot, even if it adds nothing to a movie.Instead of 2 hours of Hanks trying to eat a coconut and talking to a volleyball, perhaps the film could have given us some REAL insight to the metamorphosis in his mind.  OR let us know what was going on in her life. They could have cross-cut scenes between the two to break the boredom and complete the film.And lets face it, the volleyball was just a device so we could hear his thoughts, really, wasn't it?  I know it was supposed to show him as crazy and needing companionship, but I think that they only really used it as a device.The movie succeeds in two areas.  1) It really does make you go through what he goes through... the viewer feels bored, tired, exhausted, and starts to go crazy... just like he does.  The director accomplished that task.  And 2) the film displays human vs. nonhuman technology (Traditional Weberian theory) quite well.  Before the crash, he uses nonhuman technology, things that control people: the clock, beepers, etc.  On the island, he uses human technology, things that people control: a blade to cut coconuts, tree bark to make rope, etc.  But alas, I am a socialist, and realized a long time ago that the value of an item is decided by its usefullness, and not its so called 'market price'. Nothing new to me, or the Russians in the film.I was most surprised that FED EX would use its name in a film that A) displays a crash and death of employees, and B) as mentioned in the above 2 paragraphs, is essentially anti-capitalism.But hey, advertising execs are never too smart, and probably just thought, 'there's a blockbuster, lets hop on it!'A bit of irony, no?",Null,0,0,27 December 2000
Meet Joe Black," tied for worst movie I've ever seen
","Yes, this movie is the worst.  The point was dragged out and beaten to death.  It managed to make Anthony Hopkins look terrible.  The rate of speech was... so... painfully... slow, and overdramatic.Coolest part was Pitt getting blindsided by the van.  Rewind that.",1,5,11,16 September 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Why is it called 'Eyes Wide Shut'? It is the best way to view it.
","Don't buy the hype.  Too much drama in too little film.#1-The film is impeccable visually, but I could've gotten that in a postcard.#2- Neither Kidman nor Cruise can act.  (note Kidman's one word per hour rate of hyper-drama ranting, her annoying 'stoned' monologue, and Cruise's emotionless, 'I'll tell you everything' weep.)#3- You cannot make a DEEP movie about SHALLOW characters.  Before you dismiss me as not understanding the art, or the symbolism, let me say that I got it... all too clear.  The artsiness and high drama were unwarranted, slow, ornate, blatant, and overdone.  A good half of the people in my theatre laughed out loud in several 'high tension' scenes, due to the ludicrous overproduction.  The film mocks itself.#4- Three reasons for the hype: -Kubrick's last film... how do you spit on his grave and say this film was weak??  - Nicole and Tom's relationship... extra naughty since we're peering into their lives??  - It is pretty racy... legitimized porn sells.In a nutshell, the film had a simple message, which was told through transparent, yet extranneous vehicles.  There was nothing behind the jumbled mass of art (or as one reviewer stated well... nothing beneath the mask).P.S.  If I'd have had to sit through that God-awful piano track ONE more time...",2,3,6,19 July 1999
Blow," Doesn't even make sense while it glorifies criminality
","Okay, it glorifies a criminal, that's been established.  It has really bad cinematography (lighting), direction (could they have flash-cut some more?), and effects (George's pillow, er, I mean, gut at the end).  The acting, apart from some decent moments, isn't phenomenal.  And George's accent stinks (exact same new england accent after speaking spanish for years?? Uh, no).But after watching it a second time, I'd like to point out some things that to me are plot holes.(1) Why does it take so long for George to get 'screwed'?  That is, why did it take so long for the drug producers to sell more directly? (2) Why does Diego try so hard to find out George's west coast contact? Once George 'created the market' couldn't Diego have sold to any Hollywood bigshot? (3) Why, once Diego 'screws' George, does he take so long to 'screw' Paul Rueben's character?  Again, couldn't he have just found any other rich person with California connections?  What made this hairdresser/entrepreneur so darned essential to this whole cartel?  There were evidently thousands of people wanting (and addicted to) cocaine... just sell them some! (4) why, when the Colombians are first involving him with a pilot, George didn't recommend to work with his old buddy 'Dooley' (5) what I kept waiting for - whatever happened to TUNA, or any of his old friends. (Besides....) (MOST OF ALL, 6) Why, after George's party with the 'cocaine buffet' would the police be the slightest bit interested in having George take the rap for all the possession of drugs at the party?  Wouldn't they want names, info., state's evidence?  Wouldn't George not having to name any be a deal for HIM??This story doesn't even make sense!!  While painting George to be a misunderstood hero, and oh, we weep for his loss of his daughter, it forgets to even be logical.And 'slipping' from the narrators memory are any explanations of: A) why he never paid child support B) why he couldn't get a real job ever in his life, even when sober, and even though he supposedly admired his Dad's work ethic so much C) why so many people evidently thought he was a schmuck (his mom, his wife, his daughter, Diego, etc.)Had the movie made logical sense, I could have accepted it as a polemic. But it fails to even do that.",3,15,27,16 September 2001
Vanilla Sky," new face to: 'and it was all a dream'
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** When I was in grammar school, my friends and I went through a phase where all of our journal entries, the stories we wrote for class, would end in 'and it was all a dream', or 'and then I woke up'.  I'm sure you're familiar with this device... make a crazy scenario, make the audience wonder how the hero/heroine will escape, and then 'wake up'. Suppose we had been able to, back then, replace 'and then I woke up' with 'and then I realized that I was cryogenically frozen and was experiencing a programmed brain-input deally'.  We'd have written Vanilla Sky.Basically, that's your whole movie.  Guy gets into weird situation, you think he's killed someone, you're teased with a mystery (who did he kill, and did he), teased with conspiracy (did they frame him), and then it ALL GETS THROWN OUT THE WINDOW for the same ending my pals and I used in the FOURTH GRADE!!The advertisements for this film tease you into thinking it will be an action-drama with a murder mystery.  Just when the film gets you compelled with this apparent plot development (not an easy task with drawn-out boring scenes, typically crappy Cruise acting, and a lead character that probably 1% of America can identify with)... just as it gets you into that, it says 'gotcha', and goes into a laughable (people in my theater did groan and laugh) sci-fi bailout.This could have been a good movie.  I was expecting a REAL twist with a plot against David and a switcheroo of sorts with the women in his life.  They could have gone so many interesting places with this situation, and then they throw it out instead of exploring it (and they throw it out fast, before we can even enjoy the suspense) and go into what equates to 'it was all a dream'.And then they even spoon-feed you the details!!  'When did the Lucid Dream begin?', David asks... AND THE GUY TELLS YOU!!  'Well, it was when you woke up in the street'.  Why, oh why, couln't I have been left to at least try to figure that out for myself??  Why did they have to GIVE it to me?And why wasn't the relationship with David and Sophia (which was actually a Lucid Dream) explored more?  There was like 2 scenes, and then we got into the murder crap.  Why was I supposed to feel anything for David and Sophia (and feel his pain) when they barely developed that  relationship?The reason they are saying that reviewers should 'not reveal secrets' about this movies plot is because (a) if you said one or two sentences, the whole movies would be shot, as it takes only that one lame turn... and (b) if people knew that the ending was this cheezy, they would never come into the theater to see it.",1,1,4,15 December 2001
The Sixth Sense," Mr Mauve's justification is wrong. PLOT HOLES!
","The line that the poster below mentions may explain why Bruce Willis does not see other ghosts, etc.  (SPOILER) But it DOES NOT explain how he 'lived' for a year without wondering why nobody could SEE HIM!  He lived for a year without ANYONE ever speaking to him?  Without EVER trying to say anything to his wife besides 'are you gonna get that?'  I don't buy it.  The twist ending is implausible, no matter how you slice it.Furthermore, the romantic sub-plot is once again underdeveloped and secondary, just a filler for the erroneous twist ending.  We could've seen a little more development of the lack of their marriage (showing how he was inhumanly busy for a year, etc.)The script was recycled from 'The Shining', a much better film as far as acting, cinematography, music, development of the characters, and most other aspects go.  Save your money and rent that classic instead of this fluff.",1,23,60,3 January 2001
Rock Star," The worst part is having to hear those crappy songs
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I'm going to assume that both A) nobody is serious about wanting to REALLY see this movie, and B) nobody who saw it was expecting it to be another Citizen Kane, so, having said that...It still was horrible.  Mark lays down an emotionless performance. Aniston is no more vibrant than her character on Friends, which isn't that different from the one in the movie, really.  The best actor in the film was the old British manager guy, who wasn't stellar.The worst part of this movie, apart from having to hear way too much of the crappy music (nothing like fake old metal songs performed by some studio artist and lip-sinc-ed by Marky Mark) was that there was only script for the half of it.Here we go - boy likes band, boy tries to be like band, boy loses his band, boy gets to be in his favorite band.  This much we knew... and after this point in the film - the little jokes leave, the vicarious excitement leaves, and the cliches take over.  The film loses any momentum it had, and people start going to the bathroom, getting more popcorn, talking to their dates, etc.  Boy parties too hard, boy loses girl, boy quits band.
Gee, who saw it coming?Had the film been a true biopic, with legal rights as such, it might have been better.  But the 'oh, no, we're definately not talking about Judas Priest' act is a little lame.  It left me wondering what parts of the film were fact or fiction, if they even interviewed, etc.  And the effect was lost -- songs 'performed' were (as far as I could tell) fake, not authentic rock songs, outfits were cheezy and lame (Dragons?  They came up with Dragons??  Who wears a dragon?), and the viewers couldn't get into the falseness of it.  It was as if they started making the movie using Judas Priest's name, songs, and look... then got sued, and had to whitewash it... leaving nothing much behind.  That was my take on it.  It just felt... awkward.A more interesting story may have been the heartbreak and tribulations of the 'kicked-out-largely-for-coming-out' lead singer.But instead we get this tired old story that quits halfway through the picture.",1,5,9,16 September 2001
Evil Dead II," Brilliant use of camera
","This film is creepy.  The shot of the imageless 'thing' chasing the lead character has become famous.  It was the best way to portray sheer terror. The silence, the flowing movement of the unrelenting evil... brilliant. Done in the original, lower budget, it was a breakthrough.Cinematography, comic-book style writing, and surprising acting make this 'b-movie' one of the best films ever.",10,1,1,17 September 2001
