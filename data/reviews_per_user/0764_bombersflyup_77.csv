Moneyball," Billy: The problem we're trying to solve is that there are rich teams and there are poor teams. Then there's fifty feet of crap, and then there's us.
","Moneyball is a quality film, with a worthy story. Even though baseball isn't my thing.It's realistic in its portrayal, with a top-notch cast and their performances. In all sports, people come up with new models to be successful and other teams follow suit or similar to in the years to come, in order to compete. The window is short-lived.",9,2,3,27 June 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Joi: Mere data makes a man. A and C and T and G. The alphabet of you. All from four symbols. I am only two: 1 and 0. K: Half as much but twice as elegant, sweetheart.
","Blade Runner 2049 is a long, dreary and complex film. Much like the original, it's okay but nothing special. It's rather lifeless and a bit of an endurance test. Yes they're androids of course they're lifeless, but the film needs to have other characters which bring the film some heart, or it needs to be non-stop action, or it needs to be thought provoking and clever, it was visually good though. I lost a lot of my interest after Harrison Ford had been taken, film drags quite a bit from there. Ana de Armas yes, I think I recall the advertisement saying something about Joi being all you'll ever need. They weren't wrong!",4,3,5,13 January 2018
First Man," Let's play Twister, let's play Risk (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
","First Man is a straightforwardly dull biographical film, that I couldn't relate to.Along with being a genius, comes lack of personality and lack of humour it seems. Like Jerry said on 'Seinfeld' He's got super strength, super speed.. I'm sure he's got super humor. Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth? Ryan Gosling says the lines straight faced and never changes expression the entire film, not acting once.Now every wife of a great man has to be a great woman, with presence, pa-lease. It's odd that no one has mentioned the scene of Janet walking into NASA. With the rest of the film being so straightforwardly dull and told with documentary style accuracy, this doesn't stand out as fabricated? I mean, in another film it wouldn't be out of place. In real life though, they wouldn't be told of her arrival. The mission's in jeopardy and lives are in peril, they're not going to stop doing their jobs to be chewed out by her. She would just sit there and wait. This is what the writers deemed worthy of actually making a film.The personalities and lifestyle are cardboard cutouts, except Buzz and none of them I could connect or relate to. Why this Kyle Chandler gets these roles I'll never know, Whigham was available.",2,1,2,22 December 2018
Men in Black 3," J: Your granddaddy, heavyset man? K: A little bit.
","Men in Black III is a good addition to the series, though not quite as creative as the previous two films.A very safe selection of cast and story-line, almost like they did a poll and just fed them. Entertaining throughout, it just won't be too memorable. Will Smith is still great and leads a quality cast, including a solid villain played by Jemaine Clement. The start and finish excellent and it has quality music.",6,1,2,11 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Obi-Wan: Why do I get the feeling that we've picked up another pathetic life form?
","The Phantom Menace is bit of a mixed bag, the weakest of the prequels. Too cutesy and eye-rolling, lacking any real intensity.The reasons are simply Jar Jar Binks and young Anakin Skywalker being annoying. Everything else is quite good, Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Darth Maul, Yoda, Boss Nass and in particular Watto and Tatooine. It's just wasted potential, with some seriously poor decisions made.Obi-Wan: The boy is dangerous. They all sense it, why can't you?",5,0,1,17 June 2019
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indiana: I don't know, I'm making this up as I go!
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is a good film, even though the story-line isn't that interesting and it lacks the comedy of the second film in the series and the weight of the third.Karen Allen's beautiful, but the character's unnecessarily overdone in parts. The film excels when it's solo Indy, dodging booby traps and chasing down armed forces on horseback. Indy's a great character, that's certain. Though something had to hit him in that jungle escape, come on.For some reason the film has put me to sleep many times, around the area of being trapped with the snakes, it might be the first time I've actually finished it, not sure.",7,1,4,13 November 2018
It," Beverly Marsh: Hang tough, new kid on the block! Ben Hanscom: Please don't go girl! That's the name of another...
","After a terrific opening scene of Pennywise in a street drain, friendly engaging with a young boy then gruesomely killing him. Had promise, however never coming close to eventuating.Who's the target audience for this film? Certainly isn't me. The film would be too scary and gruesome for little kids nor do I think it's language appropriate, yet it's not for adults. Wouldn't really call it a film either, it's just a bunch of scenes splashed together. Once the kids started having hallucinations, which is early in the film, I kind of felt like turning it off, but I stuck it out. I hate that sort of stuff, it's just lazy writing. The kid actors were pretty decent even though I didn't really care about any of them. Jeremy Ray Taylor's character Ben was the best of the bunch. Please don't show me Beverly having moments with Ben and then being with Bill for no reason. Don't show me Eddie getting his cast signed by the girl bully in the drug store, then walking around with loser written on his cast without even showing Eddie's reaction to it in the moment. It's weak writing and avoiding. The film would of been better if Pennywise had more dialogue, like he had in the opening scene, than just hallucinations, jump scares and trickery.",4,0,1,2 January 2018
Fury," Norman Ellison: You see this right here? That is your heart line. You're gonna have one great love in your life.
","Fury is a cliche-ridden, unrealistic, disturbing World War II film.The film is disturbing not because of its violence and nature of war, but because of the view of the personalities we are presented with. At first we have to deal with an annoying character who won't do his job, has a tantrum and is responsible for fellow soldiers being killed. The rest of the crew turn out to be much much worse. The crazy nut job guy probably should of got a bullet in him by the kid. It's an action war film, so its engaging regardless, but the last battle scene is utterly ridiculous. If 200 troops can't take out one stationary tank, why are they walking down that road in the first place. Either you have the equipment to take it out or you don't. If you do, it shouldn't take long, if you don't, you don't engage with it. The best part of the film was with the two women, but it's all so fragile in its timing, if the crew walk in a bit earlier or they're in the building when it's hit or many of the situations where everyone around them is getting hit but them. It all would play out very differently. The enemy flashes a light on Norman under the tank at the end and pretends he sees nothing, they really should of come back and dragged him away. Why does it always have to be a happy ending. The crew that we are with are a vulgar bunch, yet the only depiction of the enemy is kind.",5,4,6,25 February 2018
Train to Busan," Loved it!
","Train to Busan is an exceptional foreign film. Thrilling from start to finish with a little comedy and heart as well.I'm not one who looks to watch zombie flicks and this may be the first Korean film I've ever seen and I loved it. The pacing's non-stop and the emotional stuff isn't too much. How many people died because of that Yon-suk a-hole, he's hilarious. It's also about a man's journey in Seok-woo, becoming heroic and selfless, after witnessing those around him and his daughter in particular care for the welfare of others in a time of peril.",10,2,4,5 June 2018
Citizen Kane," Empty inside.
","Citizen Kane is an engaging and well acted film, that left me cold. Much like Kane, the film empty inside.The telling of the life of a prominent figure, offering little to walk away with. Orson Wells surely commands the screen and knows how to make a film. Though just because it's his intention to make it so, doesn't give it a pass for what it's lacking. Everett Sloane is terrific as Mr. Bernstein. The opera singing part, with the critics giving positive reviews is funny as it relates to how the film itself is perceived, with so much undeserving praise. Why did his friend mail him his mission statement? He fired him for not having the gall to finish the review and turning to the drink, thereby Kane having the unsavory task of finishing it himself.Jedediah: That's all he ever wanted out of life... was love. That's the tragedy of Charles Foster Kane. You see, he just didn't have any to give.",5,0,3,30 October 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Not quite great, but very good.
","Inglourious Basterds is a very good film with a great cast, it just doesn't resonate that well.Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent the standouts and the most memorable segment is the bar rendezvous, which involves neither. Tarantino's chapter style with lots of characters sort of has to have consistent great moments, because it's missing something as a whole and this is a bit up and down. For the lack of seriousness, it's lacking comedy, but it has suspense. The Basterds themselves are weak in the scenes that aren't the rendezvous, Pitt and Roth in particular.",8,2,3,12 January 2020
The Irishman," Sally Bugs: I'm just trying to understand how a person can buy a fish and not know what kind it was.
","The Irishman is Goodfellas all over again, without as much snap and an hour longer.De Niro's too old to play this role, for the first part anyway, him attacking the grocer's laughable. The acting's solid, though I don't see much difference between Pacino here and his other characters. I was expecting Pesci to have an outburst when his wife lit up her cigarette in one of the opening scenes. It's obviously done to have that affect, showing he's a more refined character. Not memorable like in Goodfellas, but still decent. Hoffa being whacked the best part, also with Frank and Russell getting to that point, but the first half drags a fair bit.",6,6,16,1 December 2019
Blade," Quinn: Wait. I owe you man. I got two new hands, and I don't know which one to kill you with.
","Blade is a better film than I remember it being throughout, with till this day one of the greatest opening sequences of all-time.Quality performances and cast, though it's debatable whether it's better without the title character on screen or not. He's stoic and rather robotic and like Clint Eastwood in a Western, he just can't die. It's a good show at the end, but Frost has transformed and essentially unkillable,yet still taken down. The story here's extremely similar to that of 'Angel.' A soul forced upon him and he fights for good, just Blades personality and past aren't explored. It's missing the little down to earth in-between moments of characterization. Angel also goes on to have a son, that's a daywalker like Blade. The film's seedy, but in a good way, with shady characters and setting and a dark tone. Though fun at the same time, with excellent villains. It does drag a bit mid to late.",7,0,0,18 June 2019
Terminator Salvation," Solid 4th addition.
","Terminator Salvation is a good action flick, with two great lead actors. It's just a little bit more detached than the last one.Like most action flicks, this film lacks emotion and heart and fairly cold, except in the last moments. Compared to a similar film like 'War of the Worlds,' where the machines controlled by aliens are taking the humans like cattle, there's a sheer intensity and determination of Cruise's character to rescue his daughter along with the quality action. I got absolutely nothing but annoyance out of the Kyle Reese and Star characters. Yelchin can act I've seen it, but half his screen time's spent yelling STAR! STAR! .... Worthington's character's story line's superb and the moment John gets him to look down and see that he isn't human, the highlight of the film. All the various machines and battles terrific and Bale and Worthington excellent.",7,2,3,30 May 2018
Once," Hanky-panky? It won't be for hanky-panky.
","Once is an amateurish little music/romance film, but touching nevertheless.I like Glen Hansard's type of sound, like that of the one and only 'David Gray.' It really carries the film, as many of the other aspects aren't explored and underwritten. It's a very a clever way of marketing yourself in today's world. He has also had some acting experience in the 1991 film 'The Commitments,' decent film. I don't really understand Marketa's character's choice at the end, as she looks out the window. Overall a little light on substance, but I like it.",8,0,1,16 August 2018
Ready Player One," Watchable, nothing more.
","Ready Player One has a grand premise, but fails to connect and the characters aren't memorable.It's a wild ride, but it's a popcorn flick without reflection. There isn't much from my childhood in terms of nostalgia, which is what I thought would be the case when it first came out and my reason for not watching it then. The music's stuff you've heard a million times and isn't good. The avatar's more engaging than the humans and part of the reason the film gets worse as it goes on. Mendelsohn's character Sorrento's completely cartoonish.",4,3,5,31 July 2019
Molly's Game," Watchable, but unaffecting.
","Molly's Game has interesting content and a good cast who act well in it, but the story's thin and told in a way that's numbing.The re-telling narration almost never stops, so there isn't room to think about things. Michael Cera's character Player X is suppose to be the best player, but they show this by saying someone's laying down the nuts to him because he's talking, that doesn't make him good, that just makes that player bad. Molly as a main character's very distant and not easy to connect with, but the film held my interest.",4,5,10,14 August 2018
Snatch," Brick Top: I don't care if he's Muhammad 'I'm hard' Bruce Lee. You can't change fighters.
","Snatch is a lot of fun, despite the rather wishy-washy story.Riddled with funny dialogue, memorable characters and character moments, with a quality soundtrack as well. A few of the performances over the top and a bit unlikable, such as Dennis Farina as Avi and Benicio Del Toro as Franky Four Fingers, but other than those two they're all pretty ace. Statham, Gee, Pitt and Jones in particular, excellent. Then you have memorable characters like Brick Top, Boris the Blade and Tyrone as well. To compare it to Smoking Barrels, the story isn't as good and there maybe a few too many parties involved and definitely not the great ending that film has, but perhaps more likable characters and a few more laughs. Favourite moments include; the pawn shop fellas prior to robbing the bookies with Tyrone. Tyrone takes like a minute to be able to get out of his seat, as the getaway driver. What the f... can he get away from? Tyrone ends up getting them out of the jam and getting Franky and the diamond, hah. Other moment is Turkish and Tommy with the pikeys as they're coursing, hilarious.",10,1,2,4 April 2020
Final Destination 2," It's Tawny, sorry I haven't called. Hey, listen, I heard about your lottery win. Let's hook up. Call me.
","Final Destination 2 is the perfect sequel, for what it could be. With better characterization, better death scenes and humour.The action gets under way rather quickly and never stops. A good cast, particularly the lead A.J. Cook. I like Ali Larter, but the film's better when the characters aren't trying to solve the puzzle, so it could of done without her. The explanation that everyone involved is suppose to be already dead, because things were altered to kill the survivors of flight 180, superb and validates the sequel's existence. That scene drags a little though, more carnage please! Those logs falling off the back of the truck and the lottery winner stuck in the garbage disposal, the finest moments. Are you not entertained!! Disagree with most of the reviews on here, this film far exceeds what the first had to offer and it isn't just a repeat. The characters aren't one-dimensional for a start. I'm just noticing, two of the writers for this wrote and directed 'The Butterfly Effect,' one of my absolute favourites.",10,2,2,6 October 2018
Blade II," Nomak: Is the enemy of my enemy my friend or my enemy?
","Blade II isn't as much fun as the original and it has actually been toned down, other than the gore and violence.It's slow to get going and having Whistler back is a poor choice. The look of the vampire mutations are superbly horrific, but the CGI fight scenes are even more horrific. I mean you can see it switching back and forth between computer generated and real. The plot's creative, but the dialogue isn't great and the villains not talking hurts as well. Leonor Varela as Nyssa just doesn't work, she's overly nice and too restrained to be a vampire and an assassin and to be raised by Damaskinos. There isn't a particular stand out character here, other than Blade. I originally had the sequel being superior, but after just watching both, the original's clearly the better film.",5,0,1,20 June 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Dixon: It's 'Persons of color'-torturing business, these days, if you want to know. And I didn't torture nobody.
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri was a so so to reasonable film, that left me cold.There is no resolution in the film, other than Sam Rockwell's character becoming a better person. Despite the fact he is on the way to possibly killing someone. I didn't get much of anything out of McDormand's character, I don't see the hub bub. Had no idea Peter Dinklage was in this, why would he be in such a minor role? He can certainly carry a film better than the rest of this cast. Rockwell does good though. The film is engaging, without ever evoking much feeling. Nothing stood out, but it wasn't bad.",5,4,7,7 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," No one's ever really gone.
","Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker is a soulless film and a commemoration piece.So after the last one I had lost interest as it was beyond recovery, but I figured I may as well see it through and came into this without any positive expectation. I honestly still don't know who some of these characters are or care. Finn and Poe haven't exactly made an impression, Rey's barely holding it together by a thread. Adam Driver again and as always, awful. Palpatine takes out Kylo Ren because he gets up, but just allows Rey to recover leading to his end. Don't like that kind of stupid silliness.",2,3,9,16 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Elan Sleazebaggano: You wanna buy some death-sticks? Obi-Wan: You don't want to sell me death sticks. Elan Sleazebaggano: Ah, I don't want to sell you death sticks.
","Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is a very eventful, up and down mess of a film, but still quality.Trying to cram too much in, lacking the little moments. They could of easily taken out the long machine factory scene. The first half of the film's much better than the second, lots of droids and Jedis not a good combo. All these characters all seem pretty frustrated. Obi-Wan in part drives Anakin to his demise with his constant pestering and belittling, just let him do his thing goddammit. Wasted acting talent, with Samuel L Jackson in a dud role and Jimmy Smits in the backdrop and Rose Byrne with like one line. The romance seems forced from Padme's side, she didn't fall in love with him after just seeing him while he's angry all the time and the last time she saw him he was a kid. The highlight for me is Obi-Wan's discovery of the planet Kamino and the battle with Jango Fett. A much flawed film yes, but a quality one also.",9,2,2,27 June 2018
Southpaw," Billy: I'm a fn' mess!
","Southpaw is a perfect film. Intense, grounded and all-encompassing.Gyllenhaal among the greats in the field, with another exceptional performance. Whitaker, McAdams and young Oona all terrific. At the top with it all, for an incident, accident or illness to change everything. Many things had to fall in place for Billy to get back and the slightest shift could of altered things drastically, but nothing unrealistic. Involving, but anyone who dislikes the film, probably just saw 50 Cent in it and trashed it.",10,0,1,1 December 2018
Nightcrawler," Reliable Jake.
","Nightcrawler is an encapsulating experience, Gyllenhaal's uncompromisingly wicked.A very good film, but I wouldn't go any further than that. Louis compliments Nina on her method of shutting down her colleague and says he learns quickly, later giving her a bit of self realization, putting her in her place. However, Bloom's never tested himself or has any sort of self-awakening, just cold and sinister. Rick's somewhat endearing and humorous, but only halfway. It's a unique ending, that he walks away freely with no comeuppance. There will always be those that cheat the system, so it's hard to compete fairly. If there's a buyer willing to overlook morals and decency, there will always be a do-er.",7,0,1,30 December 2019
Baby Driver," Like a colourful balloon.
","Baby Driver is a popcorn flick, absent of substance and depth. With pretty ladies and lots of car chases.The main character Baby's pompous and annoying and the actor not worthy, while the other characters are quite likable. The problem is the film focuses on Baby; and his music which I mostly didn't like or either already have. The waitress Debora, looks like a young Elisabeth Shue. Jamie Foxx's good.",4,1,2,14 March 2019
The Color of Money," Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya!
","The Color of Money is a classy film, with a great cast. It's not perfect, but it does deserve this rating.The opening sequence is truly one of the best in cinema. Each character is at their very best here and Phil Collins's 'One More Night' is playing. On the snap Vincent! Paul Newman's exceptional throughout and mostly carries the film beyond the opening sequence, but a lot of that's due to the restrictions on the other characters. The plot's quite weak, as it's a film about hustling and they never accomplish or even get into any hustling because Vincent always starts winning, except the one with the bar keep and that's just silly. The style, music, subject matter and acting talent is what makes it a quality film.Eddie Felson: Money won is twice as sweet as money earned.",10,0,0,26 May 2018
Split," Disappointing
","Split is tedious and uneventful, thriller it ain't.So it's the second part of a trilogy after 'Unbreakable,' with basically no connection other than the last minute or so with Bruce Willis sitting in a diner. That last minute was better than anything this film really had to offer. Anya Taylor-Joy had the only respectable performance, McAvoy was just annoying. I'm not a hater, I like Shyamalan's films, this one's just bad.",2,1,6,20 May 2018
North by Northwest," Roger Thornhill: I'm beginning to think I'm underpaid.
","North by Northwest has an uninteresting plot and little else.The auction scene is funny, but a lot of it is just weak. Like why he would grab the knife out the guys back or when he is shot by the blanks, there is no blood and the body is never even turned over. Why the mother is involved at all and why are the police allowing her presence. Saint is fine, but she doesn't have the impact that the other actresses in Hitchcock's films do. Grant had to carry the film and didn't carry it enough.",3,4,10,25 April 2019
Disturbia," Watchable, nothing more.
","Disturbia is okay, though it's unrealistic and too light for the type of film it is.You can have an attractive neighbour and have romantic moments without it being light. What you get is an almost comedy and an almost thriller. Successful examples would be 'Stakeout (1987),' the setting's serious and you have the romantic element, but it's comedy all the way. 'Rear Window (1954),' where you have the romantic element, it's serious all the way. Kale, Ashley and Ronnie are certainly all likable characters, the killer (David Morse) had no presence though.",5,0,2,20 May 2019
Cross of Iron," Horrifyingly bad
","Cross of Iron is officially the worst film I've ever seen. The end.I don't want to talk about it. The whole thing's a joke and vile. Rolf had concussion, well every one involved in the making of this trash must of had concussion. Can't remember the last time I had to turn off a film, because it's so bad.",1,3,13,2 March 2018
The Machinist," Great film apparently.
",The Machinist is drivel.It doesn't bother to explain itself or contain anything worthy of viewing. That makes it amazing I guess... What someone does outside of a film has no relevance to the quality of the film.,1,0,7,13 July 2019
The Lego Movie," It's a full moon out tonight, party people here just feel alright, the place is packed and the mood is right, now have a good time y'all.
","The Lego Movie works as a premise, with quality dialogue and visuals, but doesn't go anywhere story-wise and overstays its welcome in the third act.A star-studded ensemble, the standouts being Pratt as Emmett, Banks as Lucy and especially Arnett as Batman. With many good moments, though targeting a younger audience than myself unfortunately. I find a lot of it to hold true of the real world, people having the same opinion of no opinion and doing and liking what everyone else does. Which I simply cannot abide.Superman: I super hate you.",4,0,0,23 April 2019
The Butterfly Effect," Just take what you need and be on your way and stop crying your heart out.
","The Butterfly Effect is a unique and exemplary film, with considerable scope and leaving you with reflection.One of the greatest films, with all the necessary ingredients like character development, heart and such and wonderfully acted by all involved. The much maligned Ashton Kutcher in particular tremendous, along with Amy Smart, Ethan Suplee and young Jesse James. In regards to Kutcher, I would say some people are incapable of giving an individual a clean slate and will discount anything that person does.",10,1,2,19 June 2019
Saving Private Ryan," Medic Wade: We stopped the bleeding! We stopped the bleeding!
","Saving Private Ryan is a solid war film, with a quality story and a good lead in Hanks.One thing you could always count on in Spielberg films is quality characters, but that isn't the case here. Hanks carries the film and while Ribisi, Sizemore and Damon's characters are good, many others are not. In particular Jeremy Davies's character Corporal Upham, downright awful. Not only that but action sequences lost to this character's perspective, hindering the film. The action sequences not containing Upham are of quality and the opening and ending moments of elderly Ryan are heartfelt, faltering in the in-between moments.The scene with the three medics including Ribisi surrounding a wounded soldier's just hilarious. The idea of three men attending to one man who's wounded and not fighting's ludicrous, but then for the wounded guy to get shot more while they're attending to him cracks me up. Medic Wade: Just give us a fn chance you son of a b****!",7,0,2,6 June 2018
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Dale: Do some of your friends take medication? Allison: Why? Dale: Because I think they forgot to take it.
","Tucker and Dale vs Evil is an ingenious creation and a laugh riot, while also being somewhat endearing.They didn't have to stretch things that much in order for it to work, making it so funny. Tudyk and Labine terrific, don't think I've seen Labine in anything before this. The students purposely aren't good characters, but they could have been slightly better. The laughter dies down a bit in the last portion, once Tucker's taken.",9,0,0,23 June 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Oh, yeah. Oooh, ahhh, that's how it always starts. Then later there's running and um, screaming.
","The Lost World retreads the original, with unlikable and cliched characters spouting dull dialogue.A downgrade in casting, with the secondary character of Ian Malcolm, now the main. You've got an annoying kid, dinosaur torturing and confinement and many characters doing stupid things. To be honest I can't think of anything I really like about the film, but it is Jurassic Park and visually it's good. Undoubtedly one of Spielberg's weakest outputs. Not sure I've ever liked Vince Vaughn in anything.",3,2,5,9 September 2019
JFK," Jim Garrison: About as subtle as a cockroach crawlin' across a white rug!
","JFK is an interesting enough documentary style film, but long and loosely based.No expense spared in casting, but a waste of talent. Costner is good but many of the others aren't, Pesci in particular. The length of the film is not necessary as Donald Sutherland's character basically gives Garrison all of the information in one fell swoop. People just seem to come forth volunteering information, little investigating accomplished. JFK pales in comparison to 'Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man' from the 'The X-Files,' on the subject matter.",5,0,4,9 July 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I'm the Devil. And I'm here to do the Devil's business.
","Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood isn't bad, it's just not really much of a film.So many A list actors in random unconnected events, that even that starts to become amusing. The crazy home invasion at the end is entertaining, but doesn't tie it all together or give anything meaning. Some good stuff in here, gimme some sort of plot though, as each scene isn't memorable like many of Tarantino's other films. I don't care for Margot Robbie and have no idea what the point of this character is. Andie MacDowell's daughter Margaret Qualley's indeed alluring, I'm sure she will get plenty of quality roles to come. Brad Pitt's consistently good in it, DiCaprio on and off.",5,3,7,27 November 2019
Hellboy," Watchable, but forgettable.
","Hellboy is a bit of light fun, nothing more.Ron Perlman has had a vast multitude of roles and all those films entertain in different ways. I'm not a comic book movie person, so I had no high expectations. It's alright though, the last quarter or so of the film's disappointing.",4,0,3,11 April 2019
A Quiet Place," Nothing here.
","A Quiet Place is a dull film, different but not unique in any way.Silence is not a positive. Having kids make mistakes so that something happens is weak. Couldn't they just have made a bunch of noise in one place and blow it up? Obviously trying to recapture scenes like those with the kids from 'Jurassic Park.'",2,2,4,4 January 2019
Ghostbusters," Dr. Peter Venkman: Go ahead! No, I can't. It sounds like you've got at least two or three people in there already.
","Ghost Busters is an excellent film, that falls a little short of greatness.Bill Murray carries the film mostly with his antics, with help from Sigourney Weaver and the riot Rick Moranis, Aykroyd has his moments too. A funny film, though it's story and seriousness give way to light shows and laughs to be likable by the masses and family audiences. Peter's hopeful relationship with Dana and his relationship with his co-worker buddies and every appearance of Louis, is the film for me. Going to vanquish Gozer's only an inhibitor, so the ending's a bit of a letdown.Peter: No, we're exterminators. Someone saw a cockroach up on twelve. Man at Elevator: That's gotta be some cockroach. Peter: Bite your head off, man. Raymond: Going up?Peter: I'll take Miss Barrett back to her apartment and check her out. Peter: I'll go check out Miss Barrett's apartment. OK?Egon: We'd like to get a sample of your brain tissue. Louis: Okay.",9,2,2,15 June 2018
Back to the Future Part III," Doc: Clara was one in a million. One in a billion. One in a googolplex!
","An entertaining enough third installment, that lacked the magic of the first two in the series.Things in the previous two films like Marty's young mother falling for him, or Biff following them through time and using the almanac, or running into their alter selves, missing here. Seamus McFly was almost irrelevant and Biff was quite mundane.When Clara was chasing after Doc on the train I thought, oh that's clever she's going to be on the train behind them and fall off the cliff without them knowing. Like she was originally supposed to, thus not changing the past. Instead Doc sees her and decides to stay, which was a little disappointing.",5,0,1,20 December 2017
1917," No, he took the ring to Mordor.
","1917 is a solid film, but it ain't no Gallipoli.The strength of the film lies in the bond formed between the two, which extends beyond death. However, better when it's Sam and Frodo together. Lacking action, as everything happening's surrounding the central characters. Not that action's required, but the little involved, lacks punch and realism.",5,3,7,12 March 2020
Event Horizon," Space gets messy.
","Even though I had seen Event Horizon, I couldn't remember anything about it and after having watched it again, I'd say it's just that, unmemorable.There are no highlights to speak of and no feeling's evoked. Before the hallucinations and craziness it's alright, but then you just want it to end. Quality cast with Neill and Fishburne, but a script not worthy. The two actresses add nothing.",2,0,3,15 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Snoke: You are no Vader. You are just a child in a mask.
","The Last Jedi is a weak eighth installment, lacking the magic of all those before.While 'The Force Awakens' had mostly the same group of characters, I found them much more likable in that film, especially Rey. 'The Force Awakens' had build up with introduction to the new characters and humour, here we are just chucked in and I can't recall laughing other than with Chewbacca and the porgs. Some of the intended humour was bad also, Domhnall Gleeson's character for one. Kylo Ren was terrible, but he was also terrible in the last film. Luke and Leia brought nothing to the table, only annoyance. Luke appeared to be drained after his hologram showdown with Kylo, why did he have a bloody sit-down with Leia first and also not discuss what he's doing. Then you have Snoke and his pointless involvement and silly death. Rey, the main character at this point, did nothing. So there's possible upside in that regard, but I am not looking forward to Episode IX. Oh and John Boyega stole that looking move from Cuba Gooding Jr, when he first meets Rose.",3,12,18,21 March 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Rocket Raccoon: Well he don't know talkin' good like me and you, so his vocabulistics is limited to 'I' and 'am' and 'Groot,' exclusively in that order.
","Guardians of the Galaxy is a mildly fun sci-fi adventure film, that has some heart but lacks a quality story and misses the mark quite a bit.The Peter Quill character can't really command the screen. Gamora's pretty non existent, she's basically just used as a sound board, why Zoe Saldana I ask? Drax had me worried to begin with, but got better as it went on. Rocket and Groot, the cgi characters the standout, there really is no film without these two characters, providing comedy and heart. All the other characters are terrible and just eat away at the enjoyment.Some fun's had and the ending's good, but with an empty story and many wasteful scenes it fails as a whole.Drax: Where did you learn to do that? Peter: I'm pretty sure the answer is: 'I am Groot'.",4,2,5,18 June 2018
Green Street Hooligans," Matt Buckner: I've never lived closer to danger, but I've never felt safer.
","Green Street Hooligans is a terrific film about violence and heartache, but brings much joy.Elijah Wood's character Matt, gets embroiled into the world of soccer hooliganism and mateship, helping him become more self-assured. The characters of Tommy Hatcher and Bovver bring the necessary hardness to the film. Claire Forlani's a little underutilized, even if only to add a little sexual provocativeness. In fact, all of the Dunhams could be better. I love the final showdown and everything it entailed.",10,1,2,16 June 2018
Blood Diamond," Archer: In America, it's bling bling. But out here it's bling bang.
","Blood Diamond is a powerfully compellingly epic and scoped film based on facts, with a superb cast.DiCaprio certainly one of the greats in the acting field. Hounsou and Connelly terrific as well. One thing I don't like though, is the kids are portrayed as drones incapable of thinking and acting for themselves. You might as well shoot your captors with the guns they gave you, instead of innocent people.",10,0,0,28 June 2019
Taken," Probably should just hang up bro.
","Taken is a 'non-stop' engaging, action thriller.The first of many of a similar ilk with Neeson and probably the strongest, one of them even aptly named non-stop. The world depicted here's so bloody brutal, perhaps Neeson's straight forward uncharismaticness is right for it. He's a reliable lead regardless, just unlikely to give someones favourite performance. The girls may act naive, but they were willing to be picked up by the stranger and go to a unknown party, so they were going to end up in this situation regardless if they were staying with anyone and probably even if they were careful. It's very much on the unrealistic side, as most of these types of films are.",8,2,3,21 February 2020
Life Is Beautiful," Worthwhile foreign film.
","Life is beautiful is a one of kind film, with funny moments and beautiful moments.It's enthralling and rich in feeling, but also hasn't much depth. I agree that it doesn't capture the torment on any level, but it's a film so it doesn't have to and it's labelled a comedy after all. Benigni plays part goof, part heroic sort of genius, but the film doesn't work without Dora's magnetic presence. All the moving moments involve Braschi as well.",8,1,1,17 July 2019
Don't Breathe," Decisions decisions
","Don't Breathe is a flawed film, with weak characters.Why make this film? What can the viewer get out of it? The characters offer very little beyond their present actions and the third member who died early, didn't fit. They would not get to this position this trio, as a lot of trust would be required. The ending adds value to the film, with the constant life altering decisions the characters have to make. Albeit silly decisions, because you wouldn't stop to gloat or sit on the ground next to the car to take a breather, when the dog's trapped. The guy's blind you could at least look before you rest to see if he's coming, you're in the open now you can walk three meters away and then rest.",3,0,0,2 September 2018
The Descent," Among the best films you'll ever see.
","The Descent is how a film should be, with all the ingredients for success. A masterpiece.Excellent build up and backstory, with heart and heart-ache, tension, fear, claustrophobia, triumph, betrayal, passion, panic, I could just go on and on. Visually outstanding as well. Most importantly though, an exceptional heroine lead that goes from a timid 1 to a fierce 10, played by Shauna Macdonald in her first big role. Without a doubt the greatest adventure horror I've seen or may ever see. Glad I saw the UK version.",10,2,3,10 June 2019
The Shape of Water," Fishy in the toilet
","I don't even ...The trailer had nothing to warn us not to watch this, which is quite a cruel thing to do. At least give people the option, not to watch things of this nature. I am a little shocked the film, if you can call it that. By the same man who did 'Mimic,' one of my all time favourites. Again with Richard Jenkins, my god, the absolute worst. Michael Shannon who I love in everything, very cartoonish here. I didn't mind Sally Hawkins and the setting, but that's it. I would like my time back please and some of my trust in the human race. Watch 'Dagon' to see the outcome of this mess.",1,8,15,19 June 2018
Enemy at the Gates," You won't give up the river bank. I don't care if you lost half your men. Lose the other half.
","Enemy at the Gates is a perfect film, enthralling and complete.Wonderfully cast and acted by all involved, Law exceptional in the leading role. A war and romance film filled with so many memorable moments, that's quite unheard of. Certainly the greatest sniper film in existence, nothing else comes close. Bob Hoskins' role a little overdone, but still humorous. Some reviewers seem to have a problem with the love story, I think it's handled extremely well. The heroic name of Vasily Zaitsev will live on. Also, Ron Perlman worth his weight in gold.",10,0,0,29 October 2019
The Departed," Dignam: I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy.
","The Departed is an exceptional film, with possibly the greatest cast ever assembled, up with the likes of Pulp Fiction.A blast and intricate at the same time. Damon another memorable lead performance. Baldwin and Wahlberg hilarious in smaller roles. If to nitpick, the dialogue sloppy in some places, but can't all land and DiCaprio and Nicholson could be slightly better.",10,1,4,28 December 2019
Psycho," Quite the flickaroo.
","Psycho is a journey of a film, flawed but remarkable the same.Going into the film, my only notion of what might transpire is the stabbing in the shower scene. That happens to be one the weakest parts though. The strength of the film is taking on many different forms and doing them well. A seemingly good woman stealing forty thousand dollars and on the run, to an off the beaten track motel and a murder, to a private investigator unsettling the killer, to a sister and boyfriend doing whatever it takes. Janet Leigh's excellent as the lead, though odd for her to die mid film. I wasn't surprised by the corpse, because they never showed the mother or the killer's face and it's a figure at the window mentioned more than once. Then for the sheriff to say she was dead, set that in stone. I had figured it was a voice recording talking to him. Lila had the option to go out the front door and chose the cellar when Bates went upstairs, just survive first and then come back jeez. The ending's in poor taste, as the loved ones don't want to hear why he's a freak and I didn't feel it necessary either.The highlights are the cop talking to Marion and then following her and Arbogast questioning Bates.",10,1,2,1 November 2018
War of the Worlds," Robbie: What is it? Is it terrorists? Ray: These came from some place else. Robbie: What do you mean, like, Europe? Ray: No, Robbie, not like Europe!
","War of the Worlds is a masterpiece of cinema and a perfect film.Intense, immersive and visually spectacular, as well as clever and evoking. With a great cast and wonderful characters, Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning exemplary. It's said that Cruise can't act, that he has no range, but he does have sincerity. Spielberg has given us many amazing films, this certainly his most underrated. He puts the characters in this terrifying scenario and makes it with realism, as people act in times of peril.",10,0,1,5 April 2020
Whiplash," What are you... there's no fn Mars Bar down there, what are you looking at? Look up here, look at me.
","Whiplash is a messed up film, though not dull.I like the style of film in dealing with its subject matter, but I don't see how anyone could love it. A lot like 'The Competition' with Richard Dreyfuss, though not good. The characters are complete a-holes, the fact that people could act this way with impunity is ridiculous. For Fletcher to get Andrew to be the drummer in the performance at the end makes no sense, as it would reflect poorly on him and there would be life altering repercussions if it didn't work out like it did. Then for Andrew to get up and come back, you'd have to be dragged away to let Fletcher get away with it. The audacity of Andrew to ask the girl out knowing he's a complete a-hole, to then break it off after putting her in that position, to then have the gall to call her later to ask her to go to his performance. How the hell can anyone write this crap? Serial killers have been nicer than this.",3,5,8,6 December 2018
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Zeus: That guy was pissed. John McClane: He'll feel better when he looks in the back seat.
","Die Hard with a Vengeance is the ultimate action flick, with two of the best actors going around.Great villains, headed by Jeremy Irons. Bruce Willis is obviously the star of the film and this his best work. Samuel L. Jackson really showcases that he can play any role and do it extremely well, which is why he has been involved in so many great films. Straight up action films aren't my go, as they're often pretty empty, lacking heart and any deeper thought other than what's being shown. Though, this film's the absolute pinnacle of the genre and does take the time to add some of those little character moments. I do not care about the first two films of the series and don't give them much thought. Love Die Hard with a Vengeance.John: This thing got airbags? Zeus: Your side does, I don't know about mi... Zeus: McClane!John: You don't know how to shoot a gun? Zeus: Look, all brothers don't know how to shoot guns, you racist motherf*****. John: Sue me.",10,0,0,24 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
","Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is significant, due to the build up in story and the introduction of Darth Vader. Though the poor writing and illogical thinking of the characters is pretty hard to overlook.Palpatine basically telling Anakin he's a Sith Lord, then Anakin reporting it to Windu and he taking three Jedi's who die instantly and then slowly striking at Palpatine, while Anakin who Windu doesn't trust is standing next to him asking him not to kill him and Windu striking anyway. This whole part's quite horrible, poorly acted and ridiculously illogical. The Jedi's in this film die like flies, all just to get to the required point in the story. Obi-Wan on the other hand terrific and almost single handed carries the film. Taking what might otherwise be laughable, to be tragic and yet still hopeful, as the next film's titled. Yoda's advice to Anakin terrible.Darth Sidious: Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth... Vader.Padmé: Anakin, you're breaking my heart! You're going down a path I cannot follow!Yoda: Into exile, I must go. Failed, I have.",8,0,0,1 July 2018
Parasite," Let me in now, let me in now, Bill Gates, Donald Trump, let me in now.
","Parasite is unique and manically engaging with humour, it doesn't all work though.Another reviewer captured it right, in saying it's lacking of human spirit. Unlike that person I like the film, but I do agree with that. Yeo-jeong Jo's good as the house wife, but the Kim Ki-Jung character's ineffective and her mother unlikable. I don't buy that Kim Ki-taek and Kim Chung-sook could actually fill these job roles at this time, more so the mother. Plus the guy living in the basement and the Morse code, quite stupid and the resolution well it's weak. It's obvious the father will be in the basement, after fleeing the incident and Kim Ki-woo just isn't going to go from the slums to earning enough money to buy this place.",7,8,16,21 November 2019
Centurion," It ain't no Robin Hood
","Despite Neil Marshall at the helm and a quality cast, Centurion was poor. No character development, quality dialogue, heart, story, you name it. Basically it's lots of fighting and blood and not much else. A group of men I didn't care about, on the run through the mountains chased by a savage mute woman.",3,2,5,9 December 2017
Paths of Glory," General Mireau: If those little sweethearts won't face German bullets, they'll face French ones!
","Paths of Glory isn't much of a war film, yet it doesn't give the viewer enough to care about to be a drama.Seems we are supposed to be invested in the fate of these three men on trial, when we aren't given any character depth and spend little screen time with them. Only to hear them whining 'I don't want to die I don't want to die'. I found many of the characters to be rather cartoonish, Mireau in particular. Kirk Douglas is terrific in the main role holding the film together.",4,2,9,16 December 2017
Carrie," Margaret White: They're all gonna laugh at you!
","Carrie isn't much of a film. It's paper thin with an uninteresting conclusion.Sissy Spacek's the part and it's well acted by all parties, but there just isn't anything here. I honestly can't remember where the time went, slow moving scenes, gym class, going to the prom, sitting, dancing. Yet not enough time's invested in learning about Carrie, her mother or Sue. There's just too much nothingness to give any of it importance and the Tommy character's just unwritten. His personality says he wants to be in on it, yet he still takes Carrie and why's Sue with him? Awful writing, grrr.",3,1,9,7 May 2018
The Silence of the Lambs," Well, Clarice - have the lambs stopped screaming?
","The Silence of the Lambs is an intensely engaging and chilling serial killer thriller. The best of its kind, a masterpiece of cinema.With career-defining performances by both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, Ted Levine excellent as well. Hard to become one's personal favourite film, due to the callousness, should be on any best of list though. Anthony Hopkins' character Hannibal Lecter, transcends and is iconic even though he isn't the pursued or the pursuer in the film.",10,0,1,30 November 2019
Midway," Solid film, though a bit lifeless.
","Midway is a good historical retelling of events and engages with excellent visuals, but the characters fail to connect and evoke.The characterization's mostly one note thin and the acting mostly ranges from so so to half-hearted, amidst the impressive action sequences. It's missing that fire or inspirational speech.",6,1,3,10 February 2020
Final Destination," Live it up Alex. Ya got your whole life ahead of you.
","Final Destination is a light horror film, with a great premise that's not fully capitalized.A terrific idea and cast, but doesn't focus enough on the dialogue and characterization. The characters too simplistic and one-dimensional, you have different character types that maintain the same thought process throughout the film. Alex has Ali Larter's character in love with him, a young guy who's seen looking at his penthouse magazine, yet never once wavers from thinking about death's design. There are also too many coincidences. They all happen to be at a certain place at the same time, or Billy riding his bike by when Alex's running out and why did he not warn the FBI that Valerie was next instead of just standing outside her house. The slow build up excellent, dealing with the deaths of those on the plane and the death scenes of those before they know it's coming. Though once it gets down to the last four and they know they're next, it's not as interesting. X-Files writers Wong and Morgan, use quite a few actors that appeared once or twice on the show.",7,1,1,5 October 2018
Rear Window," Lisa: I wish I were creative. Jeff: You are. You're great at creating difficult situations.
","Rear Window is a wonderfully engaging film, with all the right ingredients to feed the senses.Alfred Hitchcock and Grace Kelly certainly an unrivaled combination. Add in James Stewart and you've got a flawless film. It's about witnessing someone you think committed murder, but so much more. Jeff looking in on the lives of his neighbours, each with different circumstances. Including his own love life with the angelic Lisa, who lives a showstopping wealthy lifestyle. The secondary characters also top-notch.Lisa: Oh I love funny exiting lines.",10,1,1,24 June 2019
The Matrix," Agent Smith: Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure.
","The Matrix is a high concept film, that succeeds in its endeavour with awesome cinematography. Deserving of its praise, though not perfect.The concept and the villains are what I love most about it. Everything about the agents excellent, Hugo Weaving gives his best performance. Cypher who's Judas, the true villain of the film, the most sensible. The character development and the choice of casting in regards to Trinity, the only real weakness of the film. I feel like we could of got to know the Neo character some before this, we have no idea what he's thinking at any point, all we know is that he was the greatest hacker and that's because he's the one. The trinity character's too butch, the other female crew member in a lesser role too, what's with this? Like Cypher, I would rather just go back into the Matrix. I get that you become hardened in a certain environment, but I don't see that as the case here. So Trinity loves Neo and he has to love her back, okay. Laurence Fishburne's terrific as Morpheus.",10,0,0,23 September 2018
Life," Haters gonna hate, taytay.
","Life is an enthralling science fiction thriller, with a great cast, albeit underutilized.Not creative in premise, but great ideas are copied all the time. Take westerns for example, they're basically all the same film. Sure as hell belts 'Alien Covenant' out of the park. Not much character depth and the dialogue unmemorable, but it has tension, action and heroism in abundance. The characters underdeveloped because the film gets straight to business immediately, so it's not necessarily a weakness. The alien itself wonderful.",10,4,9,25 September 2018
Annihilation," Five women walk into a bar, no make that a mysterious zone...
","Annihilation is indeed a joke, with one interesting idea amidst hours of pain.What's the purpose of the film? People will sit through annoyance and nothingness for one creative idea, but trash a great new film like 'Life' because they think it rips off 'Alien.' The film fails, jeez. It's nothing more than a girly drama, having me ask questions I have no interest in knowing the answers to. Maybe, put a bit of focus into the characters and the dialogue and stop needlessly jumping in the timeline with things you don't even care about enough to make time for. Every performance other than Portman's, unworthy of my time.",2,5,7,18 November 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," Nothing here.
","Inside Llewyn Davis is a ho-hum experience with terrible dialogue, take out the musical performances and it's empty.The best music is story telling and the story telling here is bad. Why these actors signed on to this nothingness, I can't fathom. How a record label manager can just dismiss talent and not give the guy the respect he deserves... even if it won't sell. You're obviously in that position because you love music, take a loss or at least buy him lunch or beer or something...... blah.",2,0,1,10 May 2019
Joy," Jennifer Lawrence sold me.
","Joy is a good film, not a great one. Resting solely on Lawrence's acting prowess.She's a wonderful actress, the manic family situation and her homely demeanor is the film's strength. Joy's parents are messed up. De Niro plays the a-hole father, with a few comedic moments. Ramirez's decent as the ex-husband, he was good in 'Gold' too. Based on a true story, a fairly dull one. The film doesn't succeed in what it's trying to do, as it's better before Joy starts advertising, where it should really become weightier.",7,0,2,30 July 2019
Me Before You," Splendid.
","Me Before You is a simple yet beautiful film, Emilia Clarke captures the heart.Clarke has taken on various roles without a blemish, she's an excellent actress. Sam Claflin, believable in the role as well. A quality soundtrack accompanies the film. Many dislike the ending, but not me as the film is about Lou and it allows her to move on with fondness and opportunity ahead. They always go overboard concerning the current boyfriend, being a complete jerk. In regards to Will's circumstance, I didn't see an accident or a mistake, I saw carelessness.",10,4,5,26 March 2019
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Brody's got friends everywhere from here to the Sudan, he speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom, he'll blend in, disappear, you'll never see him again.
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a good film, not on the level of the second film in the series, but slightly better than the first.A few more laughs here than Raiders and a better story-line, though not visually as good. I don't buy the father and son pairing, quality actors though. Alison Doody's somewhat underutilized, when Indy saw the Nazi's he should of immediately known Elsa was playing him. Her actions at the end, silly though. Marcus and Sallah actually have one the funniest scenes in the film, when the Nazi's come to collect Marcus and Sallah's telling him to run and he won't do anything, as he's believing everything the Nazi's tell him. The run-time on all of these films are too long, as they all drag at some point. In this one, the tank segment.",7,0,4,17 November 2018
Goodfellas," Now go home and get your fn' shinebox.
","Goodfellas is a quality film, though pretentious with an odd lead choice.Joe Pesci stars, as his character's outbursts of violence create interest and humour. Otherwise not much happening other than expensive dinners and family gatherings. Well yes, people being whacked of course. De Niro good, while Liotta's merely there and has affairs. Bracco nice enough, playing the most realistic character. Could be a little darker in places.",10,0,1,4 July 2019
