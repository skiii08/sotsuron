The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," best of twilight so far
","Seriously, I do not understand 1/10 reviews. I might not belong to the target market (being over 30, married and with a child, though, maybe I actually am the target :-)), but I must say I could 100 % connect with Bella and her protective attitude as well as I could understand Edwards anger over his incapability to do anything and I even understood and believed Jacob's pain. I liked the way Edward was capable of being angry at all (different from book). What I didn't like, was the length of the first 'romantic' hour, this could and should have been shortened to 30 minutes and the remaining 30 minutes could have been filled with more wolf - talk (which could have been done much better, too) and/or more insight into Bella's and Edward's inner world. But, all in all, I enjoyed the movie and found it believable. I didn't expect much, and I did get just enough. Probably going to watch it again :-)",8,3,11,20 November 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Go and see it!!Now!!!
","OK, maybe it was too long, maybe I was bored once or twice...but...despite it, it was sooo funny in common that I can forgive them (creators) weaker moments. The whole time - drunk Jack Sparrow, performed by my all time favorite, Johny Depp...yeah, that was brilliant. Even a very beautiful Kiera Knightly somehow disappeared when Johny occurred:)) And after all, why is the rum gone?:))) I have seen the film 5 times which is, in my small world...tooo much. And I still love it. And the music fits, too. And the stunt-men are formidable...the pirates, yeah, they even look bad:) well, most of them :) Maybe the script is not perfectly logical, especially the last scene with Barbossa...but OK, it's only a story, based on Disney World attraction. I think, the crew made the best of it. And though I don't like Nr. 2 and 3 normally, this time I'm looking fwd it:) See the movie, it's better than most of the 250 best movies in this database:)",10,2,4,22 July 2005
