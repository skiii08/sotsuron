Marie Antoinette," Sorry It was over-hyped
","I went to this movie expecting more views from the peseant and Marie level, but it simply concentrated too much on the stability of the 'dynasty' between France and Austria. Most of the time during the movie, it was drawn out to show a certain room for over a minute or two, so the movie could've definitely been cut down by at least a half hour. If I were going to suggest anything, go see a movie about real heroes...'Flags of our Brothers.' This movie simply did not pull the audience into the theme, most of the time you'd be bored. I was looking for the beheading so this movie could end, i was sadly disappointed:(. No such thing in this movie!",1,3,12,21 October 2006
