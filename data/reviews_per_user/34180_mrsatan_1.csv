Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Ultimate Lucas Emasculation
","Just a big commercial for ILM. Interesting to note George Lucas's wife left him around the time of ROTJ. It also seems to be the point of George's 'selling out'. George has spent the subsequent years as a Mr. Mom to his adoptive children, which has emasculated him as a filmmaker.  He can't make any kind of cinematic decision without taking into consideration if it will harm 'the children'.   George changed the Greedo scene in Star Wars, one of the most memorable scenes in movie history, because it wasn't politically correct.  (George has also expressed displeasure at the scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark when Indy shoots the swordsman, another film classic.) A filmmaker cannot make a good movie by playing it safe.  I wouldn't be surprised if Episode III ends with Anakin not becoming Vader; I don't think Mommy George has the stones for it.",1,1,3,24 January 2000
