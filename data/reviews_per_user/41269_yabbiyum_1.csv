The New World," What a majorly fictitious snore
","I had such high hopes for this flick. It was dragged out and overly idealized and gaggingly romantic (and I say that as a woman who likes romantic films). Dull parts protracted to the point of near pain. My husband fell asleep. People were leaving, and they paid good money to see it. Very beautiful, but dumb. Some parts were true, although symbolic, some of it twisted. Not a movie for a history buff who cares. Does anyone who makes movies nowadays care about the truth? In the case of Pocahantas, the truth was more interesting than the sappy stuff they foisted on us. The scenery is lovely, though. Lots of scenes of people walking through fields, lots of water flowing over rocks. Just don't expect to be entertained. Bring your blankey and your binky. It's naptime.",Null,2,7,5 February 2006
