Saturday Night Fever," Expect the unexpected
","Wanna see a glittering and frivolous celebration of the joys of the 1970s disco scene with its outrageous fashions? Then go see 'Thank God Its Friday'. See 'Saturday Night Fever' and you'll find a serious, thoughtful and ultimately quite tragic tale of a group of Brooklyn youths going nowhere, but who are kings at the local disco. In particular the story concentrates on Tony Manero who lives at home with his nagging and overly critical parents, and who dreams of one-day crossing the river to Manhattan and escaping the drudgery of his dead-end life. Tony develops a fascination with Stephanie, a girl he meets at the disco, who has apparently achieved this goal. Serious plot aside, the film nonetheless does contain several dazzling disco sequences (the synchronised dance to 'Night Fever' is my favourite, though Tony's dance solo to `You Should Be Dancing' ain't too bad either) and of course the great music that made the soundtrack album the biggest selling movie soundtrack ever. A brilliantly made film which is ultimately quite emotional and affecting, and nothing like its reputation. Make sure you see the original version, not the toned-down PG version in which many scenes have been changed and others removed altogether.",Null,0,0,26 September 1998
