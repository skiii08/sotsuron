Blade Runner 2049," Approval from a Blade Runner marriage
","I saw Blade Runner (2019), with my wife to be, in the opening week (Fulham Odeon, 1982). It became part of our marriage - we can refer, shorthand, to the movie, and both get the emotional reference - 'Tears in the rain'. Every time we pulled into the drive it was 'home again, home again, jiggity jig'.I remember, as a technologist being impressed by both the high tech and the obvious tech failure of this dystopian near future. Even today as I see the giant TV billboards suspended in Canary Wharf station, I am reminded of the Blade Runner blimps with their messages of a brighter and better world, as I scurry across the grey concrete landscape of that station.I have seen glimpses of negative reviews for the new movie, but this time it was with our 22 year old son we saw the movie, and we all enjoyed it, in his case this is compared with 'Guardians of the Galaxy', in ours it was compared against the original. I thought Ryan Gosling made a great successor to Harrison Ford, and it was good to see them together. I found K's relationship with Joi the most interesting and probably prescient aspect of the new movie - as AI in real life enters our homes and begins to offer us unjudgemental conversation, where will the future of love and companionship take us? The future in 2049 is even worse than 2019. Humans exist by eating protein grubs grown in vats, on superfarms, in a world with no green left at all. Global warming has led to huge sea walls protecting the city. The tech in the movie is still by a considerable margin ahead of reality, and in some respects, not least the need to invent anti-gravity - not achievable. Put pedantic doubts aside, both this movie and the original centre on the question of what it means to be human, to have feelings, to think, and love, within a dystopian world, which is actually our real world. I would hope we have a future where the human race is nicer and kinder than the AI's, but it is hard to find the evidence.",Null,1,2,31 December 2017
