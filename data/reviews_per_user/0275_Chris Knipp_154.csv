Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The magpie deserves our respect
","The grand enterprise is all out in front of us now. The spectacular, well-oiled cinematic entertainment machine. It works very nicely and it looks like it's built to last. By now many moviegoers know the program. `The Bride' (Uma Thurman) got badly beaten, shot in the head, and left for dead at the altar. She survived a four-year-long coma, came to, and set out on a vicious revenge quest to wipe out her former Deadly Viper Assassination Squad cohorts who'd betrayed her. Now, in part two, she gets to their boss, her lover, Bill, who's responsible for the Massacre at Twin Pines that started everything off in the first place. Volume 1 was mostly battles and back-stories as Uma wiped out the first Deadly Vipers and a whole army of Asian killers in a Tokyo nightclub called The House of Blue Leaves in a dazzling bloody sequence ending with a silent mano-a-mano in a beautiful snowy garden. Volume 2 finishes up the story and delivers a fuller serving of trademark Tarantino talk and more of the Western element, as well as more Asian stuff, this time Chinese. The big change in the equation is that The Bride's adversary, Bill (David Carradine) finally appears, and talks - a lot. If Tarantino has an obsession as a filmmaker, it's back-stories, and both segments have major flashbacks to develop them. But what Volume 2 does is develop characters more with on-scene dialogue, while continuing with the back-story element. It's a little bit misleading to try to draw contrasts between the two parts, though, because the whole thing was conceived and reads very much as a whole, even if Volumes 1 and 2 were edited separately. There's a harmonizing rhythm shared by the whole approach (and brilliant'look' provided by Director of Photography Robert Richardson) as well as the way both parts start with The Massacre at Twin Pines and have a series of smaller battles that leads up to a grand finale. For anybody who can open up to it the whole thing functions admirably, showing us along the way as much movie virtuosity and fun as we're likely to experience in a good long while. Mr. Tarantino has now proven himself not just the brilliant `enfant terrible' of American filmmaking of the 90's but definitely one to watch out for in the 00's as well. As the Terrytune clip in the movie says, `The magpie deserves your respect.' The man is a genius magpie, and both `Kill Bills' are the apotheosis of those collecting tendencies and videogeek obsessions of his. He's said `Kill Bill' is `a duck press of all the grindhouse cinema' he's seen in his life. It's predominantly a synthesis of different Asian martial arts sources (shooting was done in both Tokyo and Beijing) and stuff from Westerns ranging from classic John Ford to Sergio Leone -- a quirky compendium that transcends the traditions it feeds on by blending elements of allusion and reference into a language this filmmaker speaks like nobody else. `Kill Bill 2' has something to say, but it never ceases to be a product of allusion and referentiality -- to grindhouse, to itself and to other Tarantino movies. You don't have to recognize all the allusions, but if you don't even know they're there, you won't see how `Kill Bill' came together and you may miss out on a lot of the fun. You'll complain of `excessive violence' when in fact every fight scene refers to the tradition of the movies and is about moviemaking -- not really, in the final analysis, about people being cruel to people but about loving movies. Both `Kill Bills' are quintessential movie lovers' movies. This means they're movies that are best not so much `served cold' (like revenge) as warmed over - watched over and over and over (the way a movie geek, or a kid, does) till the `what' isn't at issue any more and you just savor the `how.' `Kill Bill 1 & 2' really ARE `about' something, though. As they don't hesitate to tell us, they're about revenge. That's why they both begin with `The Massacre at Twin Pines.' That's the motive, the time when The Bride AKA Black Mamba AKA Beatrice Kiddo (Uma Thurman) was horribly wronged, got shot by the man and mentor she once loved and had her new life with a man in El Paso ended. And that's why, in the last reel, she hunts down Bill -- and we find out why it all happened and what has to transpire before it's all going to be over. Both `Kill Bills' are dominated by the wronged one, the avenger, Tarantino's muse, Uma Thurman. And the credits in huge letters (credits being as important to Tarantino, the moviegeek, as back-stories) proclaim that the whole story of `The Bride' that's the movies' basis was penned by `Q & U,' Quentin and Uma. Like a lot of brilliant egomaniac movie directors - P.T. Anderson is another example - Tarantino is much more of a collaborator than some people realize and owes huge debts to his homeboys as well as to idols he revives and uses, if he can, in his movies (like Sonny Chiba, Gordon Liu, David Carradine, Daryl Hannah; earlier John Travolta, Pam Grier - the list goes on and on). The new scenes that stand out in Vol. 2 are the ones where Budd (Michael Madsen) buries Beatrice alive; where she fights with Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah); and the one where she finally confronts Bill in Mexico. The `how' is so important in Tarantino it can overwhelm the `what.' But the `what' is always there. And the `why' -- the complete back-story, so to speak -- is slowly unreeling, and that's the reason `Kill Bill' ends climactically. It's not till the end that all grievances are clear and all measures have been taken to set things right. Outcome does matter. And story matters. There's more to the geek than just technique. But `Kill Bill 2' is as much about back-story as foreground action. After you watch it, you realize how back-stories make a movie work. Tarantino creates a world where everything's in order, because everything has an adequate explanation. Back-stories are like legends. They're glorifications of the characters and reasons for their actions - or like the comic book heroes Bill goes on about while Beatrice's truth serum is taking effect at the end of Volume 2. Critic J. Hoberman wrote about Bill: `He proves to be a master of long-winded b******t and the bamboo flute.' Indeed so, but listen to the b******t, because it's all part of Tarantino's personal back-story. Both `Kill Bills' show us Tarantino isn't just about spectacle and allusion and jokey dialogue. He blends back-story and front-story like a master storyteller, b*********r and weaver of myth to create this intensified pop acid trip tale. Some of us are gasping for air at the end of the Tokyo nightclub sequence in `Kill Bill 1'-- even as it flows out into the lovely snow-filled garden -- because we've had to go too long without any Tarantino dialogue. That doesn't' happen in `Kill Bill 2.' Even in the middle of a lightning hot battle like the one between Kiddo and Elle Driver in Budd's trailer, the two ladies take the time to stop in their tracks, look at the inscription on a Hattori Hanzo sword, and exchange taunts. Some of Carradine's dialogue may also leave you gasping for air, but the `Kill Bills' are so well put together you'll want to go back to them again and again - and like them more each time. Because Tarantino is a dish best served warmed over - and over and over.",Null,0,1,27 April 2004
Changeling," A warped killer, a lost child, and a corrupt LAPD: what's not to like?
","'Changeling' has a lot going for it in the eyes of the public just being directed by Clint and starring Angelina. Moreover the little-known but true LA story it tells is heartrending. A hard-working single mother in 1928, Christine Collins (Jolie) is forced to work on Saturday in her job as an assistant supervisor at Pacific Telephone and she leaves her young son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) at home. When she comes back he's gone. Five months later the police produce her son, found in another state--only she denies it's her son. The LAPD's reputation is on the line, and they force Christine to take the boy home. Then they try to discredit her as a lazy and unfit mother when she keeps insisting the kid isn't hers. Eventually she tangles more and more with the LAPD, who're going through an especially lawless period under a corrupt chief. They've shot down a lot of criminals in cold blood and swept away the bodies--just so the Force can control all the crooked dealings in town. Their arch-enemy and leader of the public outcry against cop corruption is crusading minister Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), who seizes upon the Collins case when it becomes public, smelling a rat. After Collins has repeatedly opposed the cops and refused to accept the boy delivered to her--who's three inches too short and circumcised, has different dental work and is unrecognized by his schoolteacher--a willful Irish Captain assigned to this case (Jeffrey Donovan) orders her locked away in a psych ward. A lurid story of child abductions emerges.'Changeling,' in the screenplay written by J. Michael Straczynski, is based on contemporary press accounts of what are called the 'Wineville Chicken Murders.' The mystery of Walter Collins' disappearance vies with the story of police corruption and the secret of the murders for attention, but Strazzynski wisely tells the tale from the viewpoint of Collins' mother, a kind of feminist heroine, since at a time when women tended to keep their mouths shut, she will not be silenced and never gives up. Some of the more gruesome details of the Wineville story are omitted, but sequences that go there still have a horror movie cast to them. The rest is a thriller-cum-police procedural with distinct period sociological elements. But there is skillful handling in the way a far-reaching story begins and ends with the intimate experience of a bereaved mother.Eastwood seems to have looked for a story on the order of Fincher's even lengthier 'Zodiac,' but the melodrama and focus on cop-crime in the material relate it to the James Ellroy-based films 'L.A. Confidential' and 'The Black Dahlia.' The psych-ward incarceration sequence takes you straight back to Samuel Fuller's 'Shock Corridor'--at which point things are beginning to seem pretty lurid, and the film almost as manipulative as Fuller's. Nonetheless the style has Eastwood's usual current elegance and clarity. Oxymoron it may seem, but this is lurid, yet (mostly) restrained. After all, this is a tale in which manipulation is being consciously looked at. In an interview at the NYFF, Eastwood pointed out that there was a link with movies like 'Gaslight' that deal with people trying to bend the minds of others: this is what the crooked cops try to force on Catherine, and they win to the extent that she takes the other boy home. And this is the most interesting and unusual aspect of the story.The acting is confident, if varied. There are a bunch of young boys who turn in strong, convincing performances, and as manipulative police captain and his chief, Jeffrey Donovan and Colm Feore are reasonable, and Michael Kelley appealing as the good cop who unearths the kidnappings. Newcomer Jason Butler Harner gives a distinctive performance as the wigged-out killer, Gordon Northcott. Amy Ryan is typically strong as another victim of the cops' psych ward incarceration scam. Less successful is John Malkovich in Marcelled wig as the crusading religionist Rev.Briegleb: he just seems too mannered and creepy. Jolie is good, though her appearance is a bit strange: that huge mouth goes oddly with 20's hair styles. At one moment after she was out of the psych ward, I thought she might be locked up a second time--for overacting. Harner gets his chance to chew up the rug himself in his final scene. A little holding back would not have hurt.The film is outstanding in its period look; and good, if not perfect, in its period feel. If nothing else you'll remember Catherine Collins quaintly gong back and forth along the lone line of phone operators she supervises--on roller skates. Whole neighborhoods were restored by the filmmakers and streets filled with Model T's and, best of all, old trolley cars. The attempt at period lingo might have been more consistent; but that's a goal rarely achieved. Since the time scheme runs from 1928 to 1935, more mention of the Great Depression surely would also have been in order. Since the screenplay sticks to known facts, there is nothing about Jolie's character before or after the events. This is a good and watchable film, but not up to Eastwood's terrific 2003, 2004 and 2006 efforts. Presented as the mid-point film of the New York Film Festival, already well-publicized at Cannes, 'Changeling' opens nationwide October 31st. Eastwood has already directed two more films, one of which, 'Gran Torino,' he stars in. Even at 78, the man still seems virtually unstoppable.",8,46,74,2 October 2008
The New World," Into thin air
","Terrence Malick's The New World is a strange mixture of mud and poetry. The writer-director scores with the beginning and end, both in silence (with crickets). Often as it's been done, there's never been a ship-arriving-to-shore-aswarm-with-natives sequence that has had quite this hushed magic and real-ness. We look over the naked shoulders of the 'naturals,' as the Anglos interestingly denominate them, while they in turn look out with awe and excitement at the boats on the water. Ah if we could only cherish the terrible immanence of this historical moment  the 1607 arrival of what's to become 'the first permanent English settlement in America' -- for two hours and a half. But of course that wouldn't work. Though the movie has longeurs, they're not that extreme. If we can see past the mannerisms, Malick is the man to take us to the new world. The moods he creates are incomprehensible enough to be 'real.' But he doesn't know quite what to do with us once he's got us there. Despite much good atmosphere and ravishing images, what follows the magical opening turns out to be disappointingly flimsy and mundane.Malick is a strange mixture himself, a Hollywood heavy who's made hardly any movies, and an art film pretender who increasingly uses standard matinée idol types. With Christopher Plummer and David Thewlis and veteran Native American actors like Wes Studi and August Schellenberg (Powhatan) to back them up and the appealing Pacific Islander-looking newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher (who's actually half Swiss and half Peruvian Indian) as Pocahontas, we're given Colin Farrell and Christian Bale. And that's who we have to look at and believe they're Captain John Smith and John Rolfe, respectively. It's debatable if any sense of historical authenticity can survive all the great big close-ups we get of Farrell's and Bale's soulful and sweet faces, respectively. The magic is broken. You just know you're watching a movie.So the ships arrive, Christopher Plummer as Captain Christopher Newport in charge, Captain John Smith (Farrell) brought along in chains for insubordination, then released benevolently by Newport to have a chance at a new start in the new land. When Newport later leaves, Smith takes over.In these early scenes we already get glimpses of Pocahantas, and it isn't long before she and Captain John Smith meet and fall in love. In the movie, what historians say was really more like a father-daughter relationship (the princess was only twelve, not even Q'Orianka's age, fourteen) is thrown back to the myth of a romance, and a lot of screen time is devoted to mooning at each other and rubbing noses between Q'Orianka and Colin, who uses a full-on Irish accent here, which isn't necessarily so inauthentic: the way the English used to talk sounded like Irish, only none of the other Englishmen talk that way, being English. Anyway the great love grows, platonically.After getting kidnapped on a mission to find the local king, Smith has been growing fat and fit among the 'naturals' and, it turns out, teaching Pocahontas to speak perfect English (but without the Irish accent), when he goes back to the colony and discovers that they're starving. He returns to a vicious slum, and a knot of Dickensian boys talking over each other fearfully and saying strange things, apparently crazed by hunger. Captain Wingfield (Thewlis) has taken over and rules despotically; but he's quickly deposed and Smith put in charge.The Indian males are all fierce iron men in war paint at all times, so you wonder why Smith's hushed voiceovers go on about how peaceful and free and without guile or anger or suspicion they turn out to be, once you get to know them. Maybe teaching Pocahontas English has kept Smith from learning enough of the Indians' language to know what they're talking about  who knows? Malick cares about poetry, not logic. We know from a subtitled speech that King Powhatan suspects the white men are going to stay and multiply and sees this as a terrible threat he must deal with. But Smith remains, as depicted here, a believer in the noble savage -- just as he is a believer in the 'New Land's' leading to equality and plenty and justice for all settlers.The voiceovers are a Malick mannerism already familiar from The Thin Red Line. Occasionally they reveal where the action on screen is tending, but mostly they pose general questions about life and love worthy of some teenager's diary, and they often risk sounding fatuous. They also may confuse the average viewer, since they're not conventional narration but go off on their own tangents at the most unexpected moments. This unpredictability is what appeals about Malick's film-making, but also what's maddening about it sometimes. Using many such voice-over voices might have helped achieve the failed promise of a portrait of the whole 'New World' experience, the fate of the colony and the colonists, but that of course would be even more confusing for the average viewer.Eventually anyway we realize this is just a love story. It's not so much an epic one as a failed one: Pocahontas is robbed of Smith and has to settle for marrying the well-meaning and trustworthy tobacco grower, John Rolfe (Bale). It's a simple story, though with extreme cross-cultural aspects, including Pocahontas' successful trip to meet the king and queen of England, where she sees Smith again, and hears his regrets over abandoning her. Maybe he found his Indies and passed by them, he says. It's a nice moment, amid the rich formal garden of some noble English estate. And the last sequence narrated by Rolfe has some quick cuts that are quite thrilling. Malick can thrill you, but when it comes to telling a story he can seriously let you down. The mud and poetry is an ethereal mix this time, and it all seems to vanish into the English air.",8,10,21,25 December 2005
Frost_Nixon," Howard does not disgrace himself, and the play works better as a film.
","It didn't seem so in the run-up to the event, but British talk show host/interviewer David Frost's 1977 series of four on screen encounters with the disgraced ex-President Richard Nixon was great, historic television. This movie directed by Ron Howard successfully transfers the Peter Morgan play about the event to the big screen. Arguably, the story belonged here all along. The paraphernalia of a Hollywood production enables Howard to gussy up this claustrophobic event with such acoutrements as the luxury suite of a 747, Nixon's 'smart' seaside villa La Casa Pacifica at San Clemente, and the impressive, downright menacing sight of a presidential motorcade. As the train of glittering, dark limos approach the Nixon friend's house where the interviews were shot it feels like a battalion of tanks; and Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall), the British socialite Frost chats up on the plane and makes his consort for the duration of the exploit seems the more slinky and glamorous for emerging from a posh airplane rather than a bare stage. Lighting tricks and artful camera angles help make Frank Langella morph more successfully into Nixon than his physicality would otherwise permit. Michael Sheen as Frost already seems to look and sound like his character, and the 'monkey suit' blue blazer outfits add the final touch. His task is easier; we don't know so well or care so much what Frost was like. In the film version, both performances take on more nuance. Langella's performance on camera brims of with dyspeptic melancholy, aggression, and self-pity; Michael Sheen's as frost glitters with a muted, hysterical cheer mixing infantilism and fear. The extra visuals of a film also help to show Nixon's comfort and loneliness and Frost's sleazy playboy side.It's important that the fakery should work well, because the movie must provide lots of closeups that those in the balcony didn't see. So long as it works, the feeling of TV interviews is better achieved in the film, and the actors don't have to yell. The camera, sometimes annoyingly jerky, but in the best moments simply direct and relentless, does their yelling for them.So I'm saying this is a winner. Peter Morgan after all did the screenplay, and he's no stranger to such efforts--notable examples of his film writing are in The Last King of Scotland and The Queen; a rather less notable one is The Other Boleyn Girl. The flaws are simply in the events. For three of the interview parts, till it gets to Watergate in the fourth, Nixon seems to be winning. Despite a dramatic intervention by Nixon support staffer Col Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) to prevent an abject breakdown, Nixon does buckle under in part four. But his admissions still remain in the realm of generality, and there is the question: does anything said on TV really matter? The audience for a West End or Broadway play is a bit different from the popcorn crowd and how appealing this film will be to the mainstream is uncertain. Needless to say it's all talk and minimal action. For students of contemporary American history nonetheless the topic is thrilling. Frost used his own money for down payments. In need of cash and highly mercenary, Nixon used the celebrity agent Swiftie Lazar (Toby Jones) to get $600,000 for the interviews. Frost lost sponsors and the US networks refused to come aboard. He made down payments from his own funds and borrowed. He hired two journalists, Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and James Reston (Sam Rockwell), to do support research. Reston was a firebrand opponent of Nixon. He refused to participate unless there was a commitment to shame Nixon and get him to admit he did wrong in Watergate and betrayed the country's trust.The issue was whether Frost had the depth to tackle a job like this. He wanted a Watergate confession too, but he let Nicon play him with small talk (despite the man's claim that he was no good at it) and temporize with lengthy self-serving reminiscences that blunted most of Frost's pointed questions. This is where Zelick and especially Reston come in to give a sense of urgency. Again the film excels where the play couldn't in showing Nixon's walk out to his car after each encounter, jubilant at first, pathetic at the end.Ultimately both in the play and the film, Frost's victory seems a hollow one, of little significance to morality or history. This is above all a story about television. In that arena, this was a coup. and there is great drama in how close Frost's project came to failing. As the encounters got under way, he was losing every sponsor, and later he lost his Australian show, having some time earlier lost his American one. The film tells us they all came back, and then some. Frost never really seems to have reentered the world of American television, but he has had many projects in England and is said now to be 'worth £20 million,' with a live weekly current affairs program on Al Jazeera English. Nixon is dead, and though he may have won three rounds out of four in the Frost interviews, his legacy is tainted.The show belongs to Sheen and Langella, but Bacon is excellent as the stiff, loyal Col. Brennan, and Sam Rockwell strong in an unusually serious role for him. As Nixon's somewhat lost wife Pat, the child star of The Bad Seed Patty McCormack is touching. There are lots of other actors, far more than in the stage production, and the best thing is they don't get in the way. San Clemente also plays a significant role. The brightness and beauty of Nixon's ocean-side estate helps dramatize his depression by contrast. There were doubts about putting Howard in charge of the screen version, but they were groundless.",8,119,162,10 November 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A cutting edge that's pretty soft
","Borat is a film-length foray into character-driven shock humor. From reports, in real life there's something quite harmless and sweet about its star, Shasha Baron Cohen, a tall, thin Jewish comic from England who adopts satiric personas. But once behind one of his masks, he acquires enormous chutzpah. As Borat, Cohen becomes a mustachioed, in-your-face TV reporter from Kazakhstan who naively and freely pursues pornography and sex and indulges his taste for scatological humor and his sexism, homophobia and anti-Semitism. Needless to say, Sasha Baron Cohen doesn't share these ideas and tendencies. He's an Oxbridge history man who did graduate work on Jewish involvement in the American civil rights movement. In this movie, Borat goes to America with a fat aide (Ken Davitian), and presumably a cameraman, and has a series of filmed meetings with locals. What's additionally of note -- and this is essential to Cohen's working method as a comic --is that these sequences involve real people in actual situations who've agreed to appear on camera but are unaware they're being used as the butt of a joke. Many of them are good humored or clueless about being duped but some are not. Strangers on the New York subway repel 'Borat's' efforts to kiss them on both cheeks and a group of polite diners disburse rapidly when he brings a black prostitute to the table uninvited. But Borat shows that in today's America a bigot with weird manners can seduce you at first if he has a tidy mustache, a glib smile and a prepossessing appearance. Revivalist Christians speaking in tongues welcome him, and so do some drunken frat boys, who agree they want to wipe out all homosexuals too. At times his feigned bigotry brings out the bigotry of others.Cohen's Borat is a boor-naïf, probably the only kind of boor this basically gentle comic could assimilate. The mean, knowing ones are more dangerous. Cohen lacks the 'savage indignation' of a powerful satirist like Swift. But what Cohen may be getting at is the danger of apathy and passive ignorance -- the way a person without an awareness of malicious intent can do harm by being a conduit for bigotry, or just looking the other way. He's said in an interview that he's fascinated, if horrified, by the idea that 'the path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference.' The path to Borat the film is paved with the best of intentions, and to judge by the extremely positive critical reaction to his (and Larry Charles's) movie from public and critics alike, those intentions have been well received. But though Cohen may be sensitive, intelligent, and sophisticated, his humor is crude, made up of things like talking about excretion at the dinner table; soul-kissing a woman who he then announces is his sister and the best prostitute in town. The way homophobes and Jew-haters are made fun of makes you wonder if anybody intelligent enough to watch this movie and grasp its ulterior motive -- to agitate for compassion  needs these messages. Along with the laughs comes an easy self-satisfaction. Does this take us anywhere? And Cohen's depiction of Borat's home village in Kazakhstan is heavy with its own bigotry and condescension. How does Kazakhstan feel about all this? Unless the New York Times and other big media are victims of another one of Cohen's hoaxes, a top Kazakhstan official has just declared the country indebted to the movie: 'any publicity is good publicity,' he's said, inviting Cohen to visit his country (to which the comic has never been). Ultimately the movie, though widely celebrated as 'hysterically funny,' isn't very smart. It's bold, and numerous lawsuits against the filmmakers by their previously willing dupes are a tribute to that; but its 'originality' is restricted to saying the unmentionable, like a pubescent boy trying to impress his buddies, or all the post-pubescent boys who enjoy Jackass or Ashton Kutcher's 'Punk'd' or the National Lampoon. The whole idea goes back forty years or so to 'Candid Camera.' Maybe the reason why Borat has been so well reviewed is that this isn't a stellar cinematic year. The critics are just a bit desperate. But the peculiar circumstances of Cohen's and Charles's film-making are something one would like to know more about. It appears they're making fun of the naivety of Americans, not just of bigots, but his working method simply takes advantage of how polite people are  especially when then know they're being filmed.",7,0,4,14 December 2006
Miracle," The performance of a lifetime
","The sports movie Miracle, about how the American Olympic hockey team won the gold at Lake Placid in 1980, defying all the odds and beating out the Soviet Union and Finland, is unabashedly a vehicle for a star, Kurt Russell as coach Herb Brooks. Miracle never escapes from certain essential conventions of the genre it represents. One by one team members emerge from the crowd for little moments in the spotlight, then fade back into the team. The coach has to struggle with his wife because as a husband and father he's barely present for the year of the Olympics. Cohorts and rivals challenge his methods. Then the big game comes at the end to rouse the audience and resolve everything exactly as we knew it would.It's the last big screaming jingoistic Cold War victory, but then again it isn't: it's not about politics. It's about the game, the coach says, and since he sets the tone throughout, we buy that. What gives you the shivers and raises the blood pressure isn't jingoism but that old crowd pleaser, seeing an underdog come from way behind to win. And it's true this time: the story really happened, more or less anyway. And we get to see some real hockey players play hockey too.Miracle is a star vehicle all right, because the focus is on the coach and his methods more than it is on the team. But Kurt Russell saves the movie and redefines the vehicle because he's self effacing without ever ceasing to dominate the story. Russell controls Herb's gruff manner with more subtlety than Gene Hackman or Denzel Washington - two actors who've done this kind of role so often they could do it in their sleep - would be likely to manage. They've done it too many times. They've started to yell. They've lost the feeling.Russell succeeds in making his character's toughness subservient to his goals as a coach. He's aloof, hard, even mean, with the players as they meet and work out and the eliminations take their toll. His assistant coach, Craig Patrick (Noah Emmerich), gets to be the good guy -- and he does so winningly. But Herb Brooks's distance, hardness and meanness are clearly part of a strategic professional plan. At the end he comments years later that now pros play in the Olympic team sports and we have `dream teams,' but all that means is that the games we dream of never happen any more. He's not looking for a combination of the best amateur hockey players: he's looking for the players who'll play best together, not for a dream team but for the best team he can coach to victory at Lake Placid, beating all the odds. The best talent, the hungriest guys, the players with the biggest need to prove themselves and win.Real hockey players play the team members. They're not just athletic actors who look good with their shirts off: they're guys who're really fast on the ice, and they're out there doing their own skating. The director shines here because except for one ensemble scene early on, there's no awkwardness in the acting of these young men. They come through as authentically as if they were all professional actors. Their presence gives all the dressing room and game sequences a sense of reality they'd never otherwise have. Hardly any of the players stand out, and that's good. There aren't any scene-stealers. It's a team. It's about the game: and here, the movie becomes less conventional and avoids clichés about oddball characters who overcome a laundry list of personal obstacles to become good players.
Herb galvanizes the men by making them angry at him, then a `family,' as one says after they've suffered together enough to want to stay together; and then they believe in their coach because they see his intensity. He's not trying to be liked; his eye is on the prize. He cares about what they care about and that makes him one with them. And so when we see that his family life suffers, it's clearly not a dysfunctionality but a necessary part of the whole strategy, a price to pay for being as focused as he has to be. Patricia Clarkson as Mrs. Brooks, dolled up in this non-indy role, is fresh and without sentimentality. Her indy quirkiness, toned down an octave, makes her seem authentic, not just window dressing.Despite avoiding conventional tricks, Miracle never ceases to be a sports movie with a conventional trajectory. But nothing is too crudely telegraphed, even as the scenes are brightly hued. Take Herb's elimination of the twenty-first man, for instance: the time when he calls his last cut in to tell him. This is a guy who's `done everything I've told him to do.'`There's no easy way to do this.' This is an emphatic, intense little scene, but there's nothing corny about it. Russell's forceful restraint works in scene after scene after scene.Many times, as when a star player gets a serious knee injury, the writing underlines Russell's understatement. The coach just doesn't say much. He avoids telling the player what we've just heard the doctor say, that the kid will be out for four games. Herb just says he has to get the knee photographed and then see. He's merely present; there's no speechifying.
We don't see a lot of hockey before the final few games. During the early workouts and eliminations we see Herb make the team members do the same fast turning and skating exercise over and over to the point of exhaustion. No team has ever been able to outskate the Soviets, he says. They've got to be able to do that to win. The point is borne out in the key game when the Americans do indeed beat the Soviets by outskating them. They've also got an absolutely brilliant goalie, Jim Craig (Eddie Cahill), the one man who's shown his individuality by refusing to take a psychological test. The final couple of games leading to victory are covered almost play by play. This too contributes to a sense of authenticity. There's too much crosscutting to the coaches and fan reaction shots at the end for my taste, but this is a movie about a coach and a victory, not just about a hockey game. As the games develop, you realize that Brooks truly picked the talent he needed to win the gold.The movie particularly shines at that inevitable clichéd moment, the final pep talk before the key victory. To begin with, Russell has good material to work with: the speech he delivers is extremely well written. `Great moments come from great opportunities.' he begins. There's not a word out of place. It's eloquent, yet Russell's strong, unflashy delivery strips it of any sense of patness or rhetoric. It's the kind of speech you could memorize, a Gettysburg address of pre-game pep talks. And its creative logic is brilliant: `If they played us ten games, they might win nine. But they have only one game, and we're going to win it.'Yes!In its simple way, Miracle is a well-made movie. Kurt Russell's extraordinarily impressive, self-effacing acting in the lead role is more than well done: it's the performance of a lifetime. And because of Russell's restraint his costars shine like winners, every one.",Null,0,1,19 February 2004
Lucky Number Slevin," Something old, something new: thoroughly entertaining
","'So here's an audience's dilemma,' a Hollywood Reporter piece on this movie goes. 'You know you've been had, but do you like it -- or not?' 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Usual Suspects' obviously influenced the young Jason Smilovic. In his late teens when they appeared, he wrote the screenplay for 'Lucky Number Slevin' at twenty-three. He no doubt did know he'd been 'had' when he saw those and knew he 'liked it' -- well enough to want to do something in the same vein -- with a strong dash of gangster noir -- and stir his influences into a spicy stew that anticipates the bizarrely baroque plotting and heavy body counts of Park Chan-wook's Korean revenge fests.Maybe neither Jason Smilovic, nor Guy Richie acolyte Paul McGuigan, who directed, is quite as clever or as richly inventive as Tarantino or Park, but this movie brings together a cast that was as well entertained as we are. Does being conned really matter? Is it really ever any other way with crime stories that take the trouble to keep us guessing to the end? Is 'Pulp Fiction' anything but a complicated (and bizarrely silly) puzzle with amusing dialogue? Isn't 'The Usual Suspects' one of the biggest movie con jobs of recent memory? And don't a lot of the most classic noirs explain everything in frenzied talky dialogue at the end, just like this movie? In 'Lucky Number Slevin,' we're definitely misled from the earliest scenes in which we think we know what's going on. And before it's over, we're going to have to re-view some flashbacks and learn that they didn't play out the way we'd been led to believe the first time.Slevin is a story of mistaken identity (Slevin, Josh Hartnett, who people take for a shifty pal of his whose flat he's borrowing) and two warring crime lords The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley) holed up in facing towers. Slevin comes to stay at the big city flat of his pal; first, though, you've got this guy in a wheelchair, Bruce Willis with hair and porkpie hat, talking to a young man in an empty airport waiting area. He's talking about something called the 'Kansas City switch.' This movie is nothing but guys telling tricky tales like this, half joke, half explanation of stuff we haven't felt the need to have explained -- yet. McGuigan used Josh pretty well before in Wicker Park, but that didn't quite come off; it was an adaptation from a French movie that lost in translation. This time Josh is great, bumbling, bold, and charming, and adding a new edge to his smooth if limited repertoire of styles. This movie lets the 'victim' (if he is that; who knows?) and the 'sleuth,' Lindsey (Lucy Liu), Josh's friend's neighbor and a ditsy but lovable coroner, have a real romance going on and takes the time to develop that romance both in and out of bed, a nice change from recent movies that are so intense about their nasty business that their sweetness gets short shrift.So Slevin, Josh, gets mugged on the way from the airport to his friend's flat. Next he's in a towel, slung very low on his hips to show off his long torso, nursing a smashed-in nose and entertaining Lucy Liu, who's come over for a cup of sugar and stays on for sleuthing and romance -- because he gets his nose broken again by some of The Boss's goons, and Lucy Liu tries to figure out what's going on. What we learn is that The Rabbi has had The Boss's son killed by a professional assassin called Mr. Goodcat (Willis) and now The Boss wants to kill The Fairy (Yitzchok, Michael Rubenfeld), The Rabbi's son, and make Josh do it, because he thinks Josh is his shifty pal, who owes both gang lords a lot of money.Josh, that is Slevin, handles himself with such aplomb when dragged around in nothing but the towel, that you wonder. He says he has a condition that makes him never worry about anything. He's witty, and completely unafraid. His character is one of Smilovic's greatest achievements and a feather in the cap for Hartnett, whose light comedic skills seen in things like 'The Virgin Suicides' and 'Blow Dry' needed this extra dash of ultra-violence to give them punch. Lucy Liu is quite equal to his panache and adds a bright improvisatory flutter to her character.Freeman and Kingsley give intense, hammy performances that only actors of their caliber could carry off. Willis is adept though his part hasn't the range of his Butch in Pulp Fiction. Stanley Tucci comes into play as Brikowski, member of a cop team watching the gangsters who intervenes to try to find out who Slevin is. Who is this guy? They have no record of him. He doesn't exist for them.It's impossible to describe the story from there on, because that's when the surprises really begin. Like all shaggy dog-con job crime stories, this one goes way back in time, and the guy in the wheelchair in the airport waiting room in Scene One alluded to something twenty years ago.Contributing significantly to 'Lucky Number Slevin's' smooth style are the flashy camera moves of cinematographer Peter Sova and psychedelic interiors by François Seguin that underline the hall-of-mirrors nature of the plot.There may not be enough depth of conception or structure to make this the kind of cult movie you watch over and over to dissect; you'll watch it again, if you like it, for the zingy dialogue. Despite its unabashedly derivative nature, it has fresh twists, most notably its peculiar combination of revenge and romance. Hot or cold, revenge is always sweet but usually comes at a severe price. Not this time.",8,4,14,10 April 2006
3:10 to Yuma," A place in the mind still left for heroism
","James Mangold: 3:10 to Yuma (2007) A place in the mind still left for heroism With the help of two British actors, New Zealander Russell Crowe and Welshman Christian Bale, James Mangold has directed an intense, beautifully photographed remake of the 1957 movie 3:10 to Yumathat breathes new life into the American western. The continuing power of this seemingly antiquated genre is the way it provides settings in which moral conflicts mean something. The center of the film is the relationship between Crowe's charming villain Ben Wade and Bale's struggling rancher Dan Evans. As opponents/foils, the two end up mano-a-mano, with only Evans left to take the captive Wade to the jail-bound train.Wade is not only a man who's been very good at being bad, but an artist who quotes the Bible and never loses his cool; he has panache and style. Evans appears as a diminished, now hopeless, man whose own elder son William (Logan Lerman) lacks respect for him and is fascinated by the outlaw. A predatory neighbor who covets his land has cut off Evans' water so his cattle will die. He lost a foot in the Civil War but that isn't any kind of badge of courage; his greatest strength may be his sheer desperation. Wade's gang is all around, and in the lawless post-Civil War West there isn't another man in miles with the courage and devotion to civil order necessary to risk helping the rancher. But Evans goes to the last mile just for the $200 he's been offered to do the job and refuses the thousand Wade offers to let him go. If he's being stripped to the bone, the skeleton that remains is steadfast and noble enough to impress his wily charge.The Wild West is a world of such mythical dimensions that the duel of these two men still makes sense and speaks to us. It's a world where values don't come easy. The skimpy hardscrabble towns that dot the plains have no law and order to speak of. It's a bank employee who's behind Wade's being brought to justice, because money talks and the bank has lost a lot of that to Wade's gang. It's every man for himself and Wade has done well. Everyone is armed, shooters are respected, and Wade's a good one. In Crowe's terrific understated performance, he never ceases to be quietly seductive; and in fact he seduces a woman before our eyes and almost seduces Evan's wife. We see how hard and tough he is. He always seems to have resources to spare.But as an actor, Christian Bale's stock goes up a few more notches here too: he has been piling one accomplishment on another and this time he proves a fitting match for the great Crowe. As Dan Evans, there's a sterling cleanness about Bale's deeply tanned face. It's the face of a soulful man of integrity. He's stripped down to nothing, and can take nothing for granted. And in turn he is a man who won't give in. No matter who survives, Dan Evans' values are the ones that are destined to triumph. As in all great myths, we watch not to see what will happenwe know thatbut how it will be played out, with what style and what emotion. And the filmmakers and the cast do not fail us there.This is probably more cynical than the 1957 original (which unfortunately I have not yet seen). Today's stars don't have the purity of the John Waynes, the Glenn Fords (but Ford was cast against type in the earlier version as Wade), the Henry Fondas. But the very fact that actors like Bale or Crowe are less sterling or rigid in the image they project and we and they live in a blurrier world makes for a duel that's also, arguably, troubling and interesting in new ways. It's haunting to see Peter Fonda, aging now, resembling his father, very fine as Byron McElroy, a character new to this version, essentially a mercenary, not a good guy but a bounty hunter bent on getting the prisoner to justice strictly for the money.The acting is so strong in this character-driven drama you may not notice its physicality has high points and low points. There's a robbery in which a stagecoach gets upended that's dazzling and fresh. But a night raid by Indians is so sketchily staged and shot it's not quite there and you barely know what's going on. The final stretch from a hotel to the train station is so open to crossfire Dan's traversing it successfully with Ben seems not difficult but impossible. It's an exciting sequence nonetheless, but compared to other cowboy final shootouts not a very suspenseful one. The movie has a good sense of landscape and at certain moments its images even have some of the feel of period photographs, like Jarmusch's remarkable Dead Man.Maybe it's not such a bad thing that it's hard to single out certain scenes as the best. It all hangs together in this adaptation of the original Elmore Leonard story. A most interesting feature is the way Dan's son William has the spirit of an outlaw, but becomes a hero on the good guy sidebecause he can, and it's his dad. William partakes of the movie's sense that almost anybody can go either way by luck or a twist of fate, and this is what gives this twentieth-century western a lot of its edge.Set alongside earlier movies like Cop Land; Girl, Interrupted; and Walk the Line, this looks like Mangold's best work so far. It may be hard to make a western any more and always was hard to make a really good one, but this is an impressive demonstration that the genre has not breathed its last.",8,3,6,11 September 2007
Catch Me If You Can," A festival of panache
","Steven Spielberg's `Catch Me If You Can' is one of those movies that are almost pure fun. It's a series of bold capers in which a mere teenager fools masses of people out of tons of money -- sheer naughtiness in this lighthearted version of a true (well, mostly true) story. Along the way the boy develops a worthy opponent, falls in love and wins his girl, goes to jail and gets an early release to serve as an FBI expert on the very cons he has perpetrated.It's not a complete lark.  The young Frank Abagnale Jr.'s bold and brilliant deceptions are like the pearls squeezed from an oyster out of a point of pain-his father's humiliation and his parents' sudden divorce.  Con men are often desperately inadequate (but talented) individuals who hate who they really are and have to invent lies about themselves and paper their path with stolen money.  But though imposters may be pathetic, they're capable of great daring and panache, and Frank (Leonardo Di Caprio) has more than the usual allotment of these qualities.  He wasn't just talented, but very bright. His FBI nemesis Hanratty (Tom Hanks) finally gets him to reveal how he passed the Louisiana bar exams:  he studied for them Â–- but only for two weeks!   Abagnale passed as doctor and lawyer from what he learned from watching TV dramas.   This is a true story (well, as we said, mostly) and the real Frank Abagnale was and is a brilliant specialist in checks and other falsified documents:  today, in real life, his expertise is worth millions in annual fees for advising corporations on how to avoid fraud.`Catch Me' is set in the early to mid Sixties, a time when airline travel had glamour and no fear, and Frank's favorite scam was to pose as an airline pilot.   Much of the delight of the movie is the precise but never cloying evocation of the period and the thrill of its glamour for a daring young man.  Every scene is a visual delight, but there's a light touch -- unlike Todd Haynes' heavy-handed Fifties sets in `Far From Heaven.' 
The 2002 Christmas season has unveiled two comebacks for Di Caprio.  `Gangs of New York,' though interesting, is not a successful film, and Di Caprio is miscast in it as the young tough son of a martyred Irish gang leader, Amsterdam Vallon.  This is too sullen and repressed a role for the irrepressible, ebullient, risk-taking Leo.  He doesn't look quite right, and he doesn't have the subtlety to show the conflict his character would feel after befriending Bill the Butcher, when planning to turn against him and get his revenge for his father's death at Bill's hands. 
But `Catch Me' is quite the opposite kind of movie: unlike the overcomplicated, conflicted, hashed up `Gangs,' it has an admirable directness and simplicity, focusing as it does on the fundamental family issues, the string of hilarious and spectacular capers, the dramatic and funny love story with Brenda (the charming Amy Adams III) and the friendly duel with the adversary, Hanratty.  For Di Caprio the role of Frank is as near as possible to the ideal one for who he is today.
Di Caprio's most successful performances are like bold exploits of fabulous pretense, most spectacularly perhaps his role as the obstreperous retarded boy in `What's Eating Gilbert Grape.'  Another bold boast of a performance is as Rimbaud in Agnieszka Holland's `Total Eclipse.'  But let's not overlook the braggadocio of Leo's work in `Titanic,' where he dazzles the prettiest, the most well born, most desirable girl on the greatest ship that ever sailed -- and sank -- and has the bravado to save her in a final love poem of an escape.All these Di Caprio roles also have their share of pain and anguish, and there again Frank seems ideal for him to play, because of the neediness and pain that motivates Frank's exploits, even if most of the time he is having enormous amounts of fun which we amorally tend to share.  Leonardo looks supremely right for this role too, with his crisp, tidy, pretty features and his neatly cropped hair, his thin torso that fits perfectly into the tight pants and shirts of the early Sixties.  Di Caprio is a bit of an eclectic clotheshorse, and rarely has an actor had a better opportunity to show off fashion as part and parcel of a role.  Leo's clean-cut baby face helps him pose as under 19, when he's really 28.By the way:  in a sense isn't any actor a con artist?  Isn't he a man who fools us into thinking he's someone else?  That makes Di Caprio's Frank Abagnale, Jr. the definitive actor's role.  And Di Caprio has always seemed to strut and charm.  Or drool and charm, if need be:  Scorsese has said that when he saw `Gilbert Grape' he thought Leo was really a retarded boy.  He was conned!The movie is far from being obsessed with Frank.  Hanratty (Hanks) is his essential foil, as plodding as Frank is smooth.  Tom Hanks, who's become the most self-effacing, not to say saintly, of actors, isn't the lumpish pawn he was in `Road to Perdition.'  He's repressed, but there's a coyness in the way he hides his truths from his opponent when they communicate, and there's a winning warmness in his affection for Frank.  Hanks on film has undergone transformations, humiliations, terminal AIDS, shipwrecks, isolation, tragic loss, and now this!  --Bad, bulky suits, and the role of a bumbling, unimaginative FBI operative without particular style, or, so it appears at first, ability.  For years it would seem he can't trap his target because he lacks Frank's sprezzatura. But what he does turn out to have is authentic determination, dogged loyalty to the chase -- whose serial nature is signaled by the two opponents' annual Christmas even phone conversations.Hank's modulation of types in his recent film performances is so subtle that it's hard to define precisely the way this one stands out, and some won't even get it.  But there's not only the emerging warmth but also, under the cloddishness, a cool inwardness from the start that suggests that his steadfastness has ropes of steel and that he has the courage to maintain it no matter how foolish he may look.  Hanratty is a parallel proletarian hero, balanced against Frank Jr.'s flashier one.Chris Walken gives a fascinating performance as Frank's dad, and Martin Sheen is excellent as Brenda's.There's one sequence among many that stands out.  Frank escapes from the country by donning his pilot's blues once again to stage a recruiting session at some girls' school.  Then he prances through an airport full of FBI agents, surrounded by the impenetrable camouflage of eight very pretty young women in fetching stewardesses' uniforms. This quintessential moment is so delicious it makes one want to cry.  It's movie heaven. This is one of Speilberg's finest efforts, all the better for seeming effortless.",Null,0,0,27 December 2002
Marie Antoinette," Such sad bonbons
","Audacious, delicious, exaggerated and preposterous, Sofie Coppola's third film, Marie Antoinette, plunges into the life of the Austrian princess who became queen of France and was beheaded in the Revolution, following Antonia Fraser's recent biography in describing her as a frustrated, lonely, brave teenager who never ceased to be a child and achieved maturity just in time to die. The film is a grandiose, sometimes touching, sometimes indigestible mixture. Starting with Kirsten Dunst, a splendid actress, very touching in her openness (but does she know what it's like to become a queen?) and the sleek, stolid Jason Schwartzman, a slacker-seeker now turned teenage king. Shot largely at Versailles, it's lavish and authentic visually (or authentic-feeling; furniture and clothing had to be invented), but the film's French characters speak in English and American accents and the musical background is full of Eighties pop. Fruit of a girlish fantasy, it's a symphony of eye candy and real candy, bonbons and pinks and bright colors, a glorious superficial panorama that seeks to be a deep personal portrait of a tormented life. Perhaps 7.5/10 for screenplay, but the dazzle-factor counts for a lot.Ms. Coppola would have none of the sepia tones of historical 'Masterpiece Theater' productions; but this isn't such a boldly original step as the film's promoters imply and the director herself acknowledges a debt to Kubrick's Barry Lynden (and used the latter's costume designer). Frears's brilliant 1988 Dangerous Liaisons comes to mind, similarly light and bright. It's also true that Marie's somewhat crude dialogue suffers by comparison with Christopher Hampton's sharp adaptation of Choderlos de Laclos. The talk in Marie is factual, or telegraphs information. The new film doesn't evoke the wit and sophistication of the eighteenth century. The story, so detailed at first, seems rushed more and more as it goes on. But still it leaves you with something. And that something may be Louis and Marie going to bed  and nothing happening, night after night. They didn't produce a child and maybe didn't even have real completed sex for the first seven years. One comes to feel sorry for Louis too: there's something helpless and sweet about Schwartzman that makes the seemingly odd casting eventually pay off. Coppola negotiates a narrow line between spectacle and intimate story. Some of the moments are bombastic, as when the father Louis XV (Rip Torn) or some chief of protocol stamps a staff on the floor, reams of Manohlo Blahnik shoes or pretty pastries flow by our eyes, we get a vast panorama of Versailles or a huge elephant in our face, or a blast of organ music knocks us out of our seats. There are many royal eating scenes, the couple facing forward with vast symmetrical arrangements of food in front of them with the courses loudly announced, as in Rossellini's La Prise du Pouvoir par Louis XIV. Unlike Rossellini, Coppola doesn't strive for an alienation effect but wants us to identify with the fourteen-year-old Austrian girl from the moment she has everything taken away from her, even her dog, and is dressed in French clothes to meet the Dauphin. We're not very aware of the passage of time  Coppola's movie tries too hard to avoid historical-film convention for that  but our heroine goes through some heavy changes. She drinks and takes drugs (what's in that pipe the women pass we don't know), she stays up all night, sneaks to Paris in disguise for a masked ball, squanders millions on landscaping (which merely embellished Le Nôtre's designs) and clothes and gambles and wolfs down so many sweets you wonder how he could get into those tight bodices. She gets heavily into the Pastoral shepherdess scene and then has an affair with a sexy Swedish count, Axel von Ferson, played by Jamie Dornan, a former Calvin Klein model with long limbs and dreamy eyes, right out of a soap opera, or the cover of a pulp romance. The way the movie shows it, this indiscretion was soon over; weren't there plenty more? Somehow there isn't time to show, with all the costumes and bonbons. This is where the movie most falls short: on a sense of events unfolding outside, or even inside; it's high on the emotions and the visuals, which never cease to be fun. Even when king and queen are driving away to be beheaded, Marie is looking out the window to admire the gardens. We get some court intrigue, notably conflict with Louis XV (Rip Torn)'s mistress Madame du Barry, played by Asia Argento as a vampire of a vamp. Ever present as a mean schoolmistress is the chief of etiquette, Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis), forever frowning and stretching her long thin neck. And Marie's female play pals are lovely and cool. Ultimately if all this elaborate stuff stands or falls with Kirsten Dunst, then it's at least okay, because Ms. Dunst has innocence and freshness and aloneness about her, and she's got the freshTeutonic looks Marie's Austrian background requires, and young as she is, she's got the energy and presence of an experienced actress. This isn't a great movie but it's a fabulous one. I dare costume-historical queens to stay away.The screenplay really only rates a 6 or a 7, but the dazzle-factor of the mise-en-scene is so great I'll be nice and award the film an 8.",8,5,15,22 September 2006
United 93," A work of remarkable clarity about a terrible day
","Director Paul Greengrass began as a documentary journalist-filmmaker with a political bent and showed himself an excellent maker of the pseudo-documentary in his 2002 Bloody Sunday, about a shocking event in Northern Ireland. He then used his energetic camera to liven up The Bourne Supremacy. His political awareness is evident in United 93 in the lack of emotionalism or bias. We see that the commercial flight direction and military air authorities could not get authorization from above to bring down the hijacked planes even after the demolition of the World Trade Center, but this appears more as a system failure than as an indictment of the government's executive branch or anyone else. We observe people on the ground doing their professional best under extraordinary conditions. And we observe an ordinary flight, with the usual chitchat, until all hell breaks loose and terror strikes.This real-feeling, superbly edited film is in contrast to the empty grandiosity of Oliver Stone's World Trade Center. United 93 illustrates the principle that a large budget is not even the best way to achieve a vérité effect. On the scene reporters don't have expensive equipment. A look at the cast will show you this film has actual military officers and air traffic controllers playing themselves, most notably including Ben Sliney, who started his job as the FAA's top controller on the morning of Sept. 11; and the passengers and the hijackers on the aircraft are played by people who are unknown to us, as the actual people in that place on that day were.The budget allowed the film to show officials trying to cope with events and the action on a single plane, so that is what they did. But this gives us the best overview of the events. For Greengrass, economic necessity is also artistic logic. Surely the essence of September 11th is that four coordinated plane hijackings occurred, and that as far as we can tell only one plane's passengers staged a revolt. United 93 is the only one of the four hijackings on that day we have any orchestrated record of, and it is the only one where we know of heroism among the victims  though some of the specifics of the latter as shown in the film are conjectural. Here, we see how the situation was grasped slowly by air traffic and military personnel, and later by the passengers on the flight. Greengrass deserves highest praise for conveying a sense of immediacy and authenticity on both levels.Some day someone may have the courage and imagination to make a film from the point of view of the perpetrators, as Marco Bellocchio has described the seizing and murder of Aldo Moro in Italy from the point of view of the kidnappers in Good Morning, Night. Such an exercise in point of view can only lead to challenges and stimulation for the viewer. But that is not what we get here. The film maintains a certain neutral distance from everybody.Though United 93 begins with the hijackers of this plane preparing to go, the image we get of them is convincing but limited. They seem uncoordinated, and since theirs is the plane of the four that didn't find its destination, that makes sense. They are dealt with neutrally. They're neither humanized nor demonized. We simply see their determination and fear. They're on the edge of hysteria and praying all the time. Was that true? At least it is the simplest, most logical way to portray them.The rapid movement of the hand-held camera is effective in conveying the excitement and disorder of the moment  up to a point. The film is more effective at conveying the action at military command headquarters and multiple air traffic control rooms than at the enormously challenging task of conveying the situation on the plane. There's terrific suspense there, as we see the plane's takeoff being routinely delayed and the hijackers holding off for a long time before going into action. We're about an hour into the film before the actual hijacking begins on board Flight 93, but the action on the ground among the flight coordinators, who've seen the films of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon being hit, has keyed us up to a fever pitch. This is part of what I meant by 'superbly edited.' The cutting also has a fine, rapid rhythm that always feels exactly right.When things become really chaotic and terrifying on board the plane, this is where the filmmakers themselves lose a little bit too much control. Not being able to see anybody clearly or follow what's going on may fit the event, but a director has a duty to his audience to clarify some things. Those who've chosen United 93 for their lists of the year's best have every right to do so, but they may have gone a bit overboard out of an overwhelming sense of gratitude that anyone could have the sangfroid and clarity to make the unthinkable bearable and watchable; that such an emotionally fraught recent event could have been conveyed in such a balanced way. This is subject matter it's almost impossible for any American to judge objectively, but my sense is that although this is a beautifully made movie, it falls short of being a great or inspiring one, and hence it deserves honorable mention, but not quite a listing among the year's top ten. _________________",8,1,3,26 December 2006
Minority Report," A frigid blockbuster from a reformed sentimentalist
","Steven Spielberg is a popular artist of genius, a wildly ambitious filmmaker with some amazing contributions to latter day celluloid folk mythology, but his results are more hit-or-miss than his millions of fans seem to recognize.  Out of 44 directorial credits, roughly 13 might be worth remembering, and of those only a handful could qualify as imperishable popular art classics. When he scores, he scores big.  Sometimes, though, the score is more box office than artistic.  In between the `Close Encounters' and the `ETs` and `Schindler's Lists,' there are some clinkers, and sometimes, as in `Saving Private Ryan,' an unforgettable patch is weighed down by an uninteresting body, and at other times Spielberg's eagerness to please, his childlike sensibility, and his sentimentality can sink him. Spielberg's movies are behemoths technically, emotionally, and in their box office expectations.  They arouse great expectations in the public, too, and they can be exhaustingly disappointing.  `A.I.' was that for most people (those who even went to see it).  It's too long -it had about three equally elaborate endings - but I was one of the few who loved it and found it magical and deeply touching and think in time it will be recognized as a classic, however flawed, and a worthy homage to Kubrick.  `Minority Report,' made after long delays while The Great One was editing `A.I,' doesn't have the magic or the emotional power of its immediate predecessor, nor does it have the bite Spielberg thinks it has.  If it was conceived as an antidote, it doesn't work that way, because there's nothing cynical, nothing ironic, about this movie.`Minority Report' is cold and uninvolving and borrows from so many sources it has no personality of its own. As a sci-fi action film noir story starring Tom Cruise, it's big box office and ought to do way better than `A.I.,' but it sadly does not stand out from the other summer blockbusters, some of which are definitely more fun.  The first problem with `Minority Report' from which all others flow is that this is another movie made from a story by Fifties sci-fi pulp great Philip K. Dick, a wrecked genius and a born cynic.  Spielberg is an optimist and a sentimentalist, if a reformed one, who is trying to make a `dirty' picture, something a lot rougher and nastier than `The Color Purple' and more sophisticated than `Jaws.' Unfortunately, though there is a special kind of craft visible here as always, the result is disappointingly ordinary and the plot is full of holes. Ridley Scott's `Blade Runner' may not do justice to Dick's ideas, but at least it captures a private eye tone and has great visual style, and its action is full of panache.  Visually, `Blade Runner' and `Brazil' are hard acts to follow, even for Spielberg.By making us care about a robot boy so advanced he could love and seek love, `A.I.' made moral issues of future technology gut wrenching: can you just throw a creation like this is the junk pile, or dump it by the road like a stray dog?  It was the old dilemma of Frankenstein - whether man can play God without disastrous results. In `Minority Report' Spielberg seems to have grown cold to the very same moral issue of technology's eroding our humanity that exerted such a strong force in `A.I.'  In effect he has said in public that the recent curtailment of civil liberties in the US doesn't bother him because he feels it's necessary after September 11.  I guess that kind of attitude explains why `Minority Report' overlooks the real relevance of `pre-cogs' and `pre-crime' to the very up-to-date John Ashcroft world of racial profiling and wholesale roundups of guiltless `suspects.'  Maybe it's moral insensitivity to Philip K. Dick's story, and to the pessimism in Dick's view of the future, that has made `Minority Report's' elaborated story end up being so poorly constructed. Spielberg and his writers lost track of where the premise was pointing.Typically Spielberg says he prepared for this movie by watching a lot of movies including film noir, Hitchcock, and John Huston, and he has incorporated elements of Ridley Scott, Gilliam, Kubrick, Huston, Hitchcock and bits of many other movies. Ultimately they are at best held together only by the force of Tom Cruise's personality and the propulsive energy of the action and the special effects - an energy that grows flaccid with the film's excessive length.  There are so many borrowings that `Minority Report' ends up seeming fussy and overcomplicated.  I left feeling tired and empty.  No real film noir would be half this long.  It's all so uneconomical, such a monumental waste of time and talent! Good film noir doesn't require a big budget.  Indeed, a big budget makes a film anything but noir.Sure, there are good moments-Samantha Morton's acting in the challenging and rather thankless role of the pre-cog Agatha, Lois Smith's Kubrickesque cameo in the animated hothouse, the retinal ID spiders who invade Anderton's post-eye-op hideaway, and the whole grotty eye op episode, which blends bits of `Brazil' with bits of `Blade Runner' but adds a delicious new level of disgustingness.  The Lexus factory episode is remarkable and sticks in the mind even as it seems reprehensible and preposterous, as do the personalized commercial ID's. Smaller roles like those played by Tim Blake Nelson and Jason Antoon are well cast.  Inside this clunky behemoth there's clearly a wonderful movie violently gesturing to be let out. I'm bothered, though, that the writers have said they didn't really `get' Philip K. Dick's story. If Dick's interesting enough as a sci-fi writer to base so many movies on, why take a story of his only to trash it - to weigh it down with pastiches and cameos from modern movie history?",Null,4,6,24 June 2002
Finding Neverland," You'll be touched in spite of yourself
","Was James M. Barrie a pedophile? This movie will not give you an answer. It's a late Victorian tearjerker, a sort of highly edited biopic in which some of the details have been changed around, who was still married when, how many children there were. Was Barrie still married when he met Mrs. Davies and her four boys? Was that the number of boys she had? Was Mrs. Davies' husband already dead? Did she die right after the opening of Peter Pan? It's been telescoped and pumped up, with the aim of gaining maximum sympathy and jerking more tears; and it works. Tears are jerked. This movie is much more touching than one might think. And excellent performances are turned in by everyone; only Dustin Hoffman as Barrie's producer does a merely modest and workmanlike job. Kate Winslet is admirable as the mother Barrie wins over through her boys and Julie Christie imposing in a thankless role as the disapproving parent.Johnny Depp, who has made so many good choices of roles in movies, has become an immensely secure, accomplished actor. Depp is delightful, as usual, to watch. The old inner quiet is still there, with a growing warmth and benevolence. He has said that having a child has completely changed him, and it's obvious his innate playfulness and delight in enacting Chaplin/Keaton mimes now has a purpose -- entertaining children -- that made Barrie an obvious role for him. As Lewis Carroll's cult of little girls led to his masterpieces about the adventures of Alice, J.M. Barrie's adoration of the Davies boys, and wishing they'd never grow up, led to his masterpiece, the fairy tale of a boy who never does grow old. In both cases, the men were childless, and odd. But while Carroll was a mathematician, Barrie was a successful playwright.Depp is splendid, both charming and self-effacing. But it's highly unlikely the real Barrie was as suave and easy as Depp is in Finding Neverland. He must have been profoundly uneasy with adults. One doesn't really see this in Depp's version.Nevertheless the movie is very good at suggesting, without having to spell out, all the things it wants to say. It's first about Barrie's relation to Mrs. Davies and her boys, second about how that led to the play he's famous for. As a portrait of late Victorian culture and thought the movie isn't bad. So much isn't talked about that nonetheless is in the air. The real Peter is the linchpin, and the young actor, Freddie Highmore, and the way his part is written, are both quite fine. It's Peter Llewelyn Davies who asserts reality, won't accept fantasy, yet also he who writes, and finds reality hardest to deal with.It's a fine moment when someone in the crowd in the foyer after the opening performance of the play hears Barrie address the boy as Peter and says, 'You're Peter Pan!' and Peter points to Barrie and says, 'no, he is.' The relation between Barrie and Peter is a thread that is strong and clear, but never made dominant.The movie is about the beauty of childish innocence and about the willing of imagination (finding Neverland) more than it's about refusing to grow up; in fact it's made very clear that both Peter and his elder brother are growing up. Barrie notes it with approval, and they accept it. The puer eternus or eternal child theme, which is itself eternal, has its classic modern treatment in this play, but the presence of that theme in the play doesn't cause it to be pressed too hard on the people in the story. The movie doesn't touch on the fact that these boys didn't grow up to have happy lives. Or that Barrie didn't have one either. It's 'Neverland' is the brief interval between meeting the boys and the success of the play.The film is worth watching even if it paints too perfect a picture. Here, filmic exaggeration seems appropriate, even the 'Neverland' that opens up in the Davies livingroom after a performance of Peter Pan there for the ill Mrs. Davies, and her walking off into it, and even the trailer moment when the boys are jumping up and down on their beds and they fly out the window, imagined by Barrie, visualized by the filmmakers. The only real flaw is the too schmaltzy music.It's not clear whether the filmmakers grasped why Peter Pan became such a great hit in its time, but they do make the magic of the opening performance deeply touching and climactic, as it needs to be. And so are the later scenes when the boys' mother dies and the must deal with this fact manfully.One can't help but conclude that the screenplay of Finding Neverland deserves an Oscar nomination. Does Depp? Why not? He's a great movie actor, and of all his screen roles, this one has perhaps the broadest appeal. He may be more interesting in Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Dead Man, Donnie Brasco, or Fear and Loathing: those are his defining moments. But he belongs to everyone now, and so he can take away the little statue for being James M. Barrie.",Null,0,1,21 December 2004
In Bruges," The murder business, with tears and laughter
","A friend of mine saw this before I did and said it was a strange thing, but he found Colin Farrell's performance award-worthy.It is a strange thing.Has Martin McDonagh, of the brilliant plays, made the transition to film successfully--as both writer and director? Yes and no. In Bruges is a little gem--but with the emphasis on 'little.' The squabbling gangster duo (and their boss), the violence, and the feisty dialogue recall Tarantino; so does the fun with political incorrectness. But McDonagh hasn't the flair or cinematic richness of Tarantino at his best. The film-making is adept, the direction is excellent, the images are surprisingly dark and handsome, but the mise-en-scene is tame. In fact very much is made of how boring (though beautiful, and perfectly preserved) the Belgian city of Bruges is. Though it is, in a sense, all about the diaogue, which sparkles, startles, and amuses, the material is simple. The dialogue doesn't open up mind-blowing and astonishing worlds as does that of Pillowman, the play that McDonagh himself thinks has set the highest standard, of his works.A novice hit-man working in London, Ray (Farrell) botches his first hit. He's sent to Bruges with his pal Ken (Brendan Gleeson). Later their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) enters the scene. Along the way there's a pretty girl, a film set, a dwarf Ken and Ray meet on the set, a hotel clerk, an antiquarian named Yuri (Eric Godon) who dispenses guns, a skinhead, and tourists, whom Ray insults, thinking they are American.McDonagh has fun with Bruges, 'the most perfectly preserved medieval city in all of Belgium.' It does make a nice setting for a movie, if a largely static one, like a stage set but in 3-D. But Bruges is something you can do better in a movie; its beauties wouldn't translate to the stage; best to go there and film them. It's ironic that a couple of Irish hit men with an Englishh boss should be stuck there. And for a while McDonagh is content with riffing on that. You don't need much for his kind of verbal comedy. The Irish have such a way with words. Look at what Beckettt could do with two bums on a bare stage.McDonagh has said the source of this movie was a visit to Bruges he made himself. He enjoyed the tourist sites for a day or so, and then he was done with the 'culture' and wanted some 'fun,' 'to get drunk,' as he's put it in interviews, 'and get laid.' Ken and Ray embody the two sides of his experience: Ken is for the culture and Ray, who's not interested in history ('It's just a lot of stuff that's already happened,' he says), is for fun.This is good for laughs (I almost wrote 'laffs') but underlying the story is a terrible scene we actually, vividly, witness, in which Ray kills an innocent bystander, for which he is tormented by guilt. It's this cock-up that leads to the duo's furlough in Balgium. Eventually after the boss comes in, there's a lot of blood: laughs and blood are two things Martin McDonagh knows how to deliver in a devastating one-two punch.There also has been by then a knockout and a blast in the face and a coke party in which the dwarf who's a movie actor from America predicts a coming war between blacks and whites in which you won't have to take sides: you'll have no choices.The success of all this in a film shows that Martin McDonagh is a slick operator. It doesn't show if--whether on the screen or on the stage--he is going to sustain the genius he showed when he wrote seven plays in a year or so nine years ago. Another thing it does show,is that Colin Farrell, who's turned away from his popularization by Hollywood, has perfect pitch for this kind of thing, and can go from scornful to desperate without losing his puppy-dog charm. Girls still go wild for his black moth eyebrows. The American critics don't seem to have been terribly impressed by In Bruges, however. It is a fine performance but a minor one, as a film.You will enjoy it more, I should think, if you have not seen the US trailer for it, which as so unfortunately and so often happens nowadays presents six or seven or eight of the key scenes of the movie with the best dialogue zingers culled out of them in a row, so that as you watch the movie, especially if you've been subjected to the same trailer five times as I was, you'll find yourself haplessly ticking the scenes off as they appear in context. And because the tone is so right in McDonagh's writing, and, especially when Farrell is talking (but Fiennes and Gleeson and the others are all extremely good), each of these zingers encapsulates a big chunk of the movie. And this kills all the freshness of it. I wish movie promoters would stop doing this. It's a virtual crime. They should be sent to Bruges and made to stay there forever.",8,4,9,14 February 2008
I'm Not There," A film biography that's complex, like its subject
","Haynes' adventurous biopic of Bob Dylan, which uses six actors of both sexes and several races ranging in ages from 11 to 50, is both exhausting and fun to watch. It's also hard to describe. But let's start with those six and the characters or facets they portray. Arthur (Ben Whishaw) is the Dylan who incarnated Rimbaud and serves as a kind of narrator whom we see smoking and giving ironic answers to some kind of inquisition sporadically throughout the film. Woody (the wonderful young Marcus Carl Franklin, an amazing a singer and actor) is a precocious rail-hopper with a guitar (labeled like the real Woody's, THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS) and tall tales that start with his claim that he's Woody Guthrie. Woody's scenes show him rescued by a black family and a white family and performing with country black musicals. He represents the early shape-shifting Dylan in search of an identity and telling a lot of lies along the way.Jack (Christian Bale) is the Dylan who became a hit in Greenwich Village and went into the South and sang 'The Ballad of Hattie Carroll' and other protest 'folk songs,'the high-profile 'political' Dylan who spearheaded a movement and became famous with his brilliant early LP's. But Jack doesn't want to be typecast and 'betrays' his adoring public and his lover and folksinging champion Alice (Julianne Moore), a Joan Baez stand-in seen in later 'interviews.' Jack disappears and his place is taken by Robbie (Heath Ledger), a young actor in New York who becomes famous for starring in a 1965 film depicting the vanished Jack. Robbie meets Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) in a Village coffee shop and falls in love, and a turbulent ten-year marriage follows, winding up painfully at the time of the Vietnam War's end.If Jack represents the cast-off early style and Robbie represents Dylan's family life, Jude (Cate Blanchett) is Dylan the artist, quintessentially as seen in the mid-to-late Sixties when he toured England (an event notably chronicled by two Leacock-Pennebaker documentaries)and shocked his audiences, some of whose members felt betrayed and shouted 'Judas!', when he shifted from solo guitar and harmonica to more personal songs with loud rock accompaniment. Jude's segments are partly borrowed from Pennebaker, but largely consist of gorgeous black and white scenes deliberately and 'churlishly' (Haynes' word) imitative of Fellini's 8 ½.Jude's new style is admired by Allen Ginsberg (David Cross) and underground groupie Coco Rivington (Michelle Williams) and he becomes internationally famous. But he continues to be misunderstood by the protest music old guard and conventional journalists like the British TV host Mr. Jones (Bruce Greenwood)who's incorporated into a music video for Highway 61 Revisited's 'Ballad of a Thin Man': '. . .something is happening here /And you don't know what it is, do you, Mister Jones.' . .Jude and Arthur articulate the early Dylan's challenging, ironic stance to the public, but Jude is exhausted on tour and his nihilism leads him to an existential crisis.He's reborn symbolically in Pastor John (Christian Bale again), who's moved to Stockton twenty years later and become a born-again preacher, singing his own gospel songs. Finally the last version of Dylan appears in Billy (Richard Gere), in full retreat from the worldtill threats to destroy his town of Riddle cause him to enter public life again. This sequence evokes a Sixties historical western in which Pat Garrett (Bruce Greenwood) is a character.This is only the barest outline of the two-and-a-quarter-hour film, in which various 'Dylan's' are woven in and out. Maybe the reason why I found Woody's sequences delightful and Billy's colorful but wearying has to do with the latter's coming two hours later. But Gere and his sequences evoke Dylan less well and are puzzling to interpret. Blanchett's in contrast are, of course, the most conventionally straightforward. She's the only one who successfully mimics the physical appearance and the speaking voice of the artist (unless Whishaw does a better job with the voice). But Blanchett's mimicry is intentionally undercut (and the biopic conventionality of films like Ray avoided) by having Jude be played by a womanwhich was planned by Haynes in his screenplay before he even chose his actor.The method Haynes has chosen avoids cliché. This is still a biopic, but it's a sophisticated one; and the fractured portrait is well justified by the nature of its subject. Dylan has always been a shape-shifter; some of his permutations were left out, such as the period of the orthodox Jew and JDL supporter. But it's intelligent to see Dylan the man, the husband, the artist, the political being, and the religious being as completely separate entities because no simple biopic sequence can really dramatize the complexity of such an artist and such a protean existence. Haynes' film makes you think about biography itself, as well as giving imaginative shape to aspects of Bob Dylan no non-fiction account can really provide.Maybe it's the daringly experimental methodology that led Dylan himself, approached through his eldest son Jesse,to grant Haynes both the musical rights and the biographical rights. Haynes has chosen a multifaceted and original way of using Dylan's songs. Only Franklin actually performs them with his own voice. Otherwise the soundtrack mixes original Dylan recordings with existing covers, new ones by people as widely various as Ritche Havens, Iggy Pop, John Doe and Sonic Youth, and other music, including, appropriately for the 8 ½- esquire sequences, Nino Rota. There is a voice-over narration by Kris Kristofferson. Haynes worked on the screenplay for years, and then collaborated with Oren Moverman.Not for mainstream audiences or be prime Oscar bait, but a challenging, fun watch. Shown in the press screenings of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center 2007. Haynes was present fort a Q&A afterward with J. Hoberman of the Village Voice, which revealed that the director is an intelligent and articulate man and who knows his Dylan.",8,238,272,3 October 2007
Star Trek," Spunk meets Spock
","What do you do with a franchise that has been milked dry? You stage a prequel, or, in other words, a childhood-and-youth-of-the-hero movie. J.J. Abrams' aim in this simply-titled entry is to show how James Kirk and Mr. Spock got to be running the spaceship Enterprise. The non-Trekkie must approach with trepidation this dramatic effort to freshen up the hallowed TV series and its not-so-successful movie avatars. Is it enough to say it's beautiful and entertaining, but lacks something? What happens is a big battle to trounce an evil guy who's destroying whole planets, and some background on the young Spock and Kirk. The substance is simple: Spock's logical, alright, but he's also deeply emotional. Kirk's a testosterone-soaked bad boy, but he's got just the balance of smarts and derring-do to be a great leader.Beyond that, this 'Star Trek' reboot is a dazzlingly pretty audio-visual experience, maybe the closest a lot of moviegoers will ever come to abstract art. It's geometric abstraction: though we're whirling around the galaxies, mostly what we see is space ships with their angles and curves. The early sequences are well balanced and fun, despite an opening that follows the typical but inexplicable blockbuster theory that you should hit 'em with all you've got in the first ten minutes. This 25-years-older flashback showing how daddy Kirk was captain of the Enterprise for a few minutes and saved 800 people while his wife was giving birth on board to the future James Kirk, is ridiculously loud and impulsive and confusing, and when it is clear, it seems corny as all heck. Anyway, mile-a-minute openings' may grab the viewer, but you can never keep up to that level. The only reliable result is that you've numbed the audience.The next scene, a nice contrast because it's back down on the flattest of earth surfaces, shows a pre-teen Jim junior--miraculously, since it's the 23rd century: where'd he get the fossil fuel?--racing a stolen Corvette across the desert a few lengths in front of a motorcycle cop, jumping out just before the 'vette pitches over a cliff and hanging there--a time-worn dramatic device that will be repeated again more than once. This tow-head smart-aleck is an annoying little cuss, but he's certainly got balls far beyond his years. He's ready to 'boldly go.' I have never watched a whole 'Star Trek' original episode, and if I've glimpsed any of the ten-odd movie spin-offs, I've forgotten. I can believe, however, that this is both one of the better ones--and missing certain essential elements in the interpretation of the original characters and in the way 'issues' are brought up in the series as originally conceived. The only 'issues' seemed to be to stop a bad guy bent on destroying the galaxy, and the conflict between the cold logic of Zachary Quinto's Spock and the obnoxious spunk (but creative initiative) of Chris Pine's Jim Kirk. The young Kirk, more or less the star, played by Chris Pine, is a bad-boy cutie. His pretty face is always bruised and scarred from a brawl, or maybe it's acne. Pine's Kirk bursts with boyish energy that's hard to resist. What's not so easy is to imagine how such an obstreperous twerp would be allowed on board the space ship, let alone be rapidly moved to a leadership position in the highly regimented, not to say repressive and fascistic, intergalactic system.It's also not quite clear how a nerdy character like the half-Klingon Spock would be so highly regarded, if Kirk's kind of, well, enterprise, were deeply valued. Are they just two sides of one person, maybe? But mostly there's so much action going on in 'Star Trek' that it's not important to ponder such questions. It primarily just gorgeous special effects.There are some appealing secondary characters (not as much multi-galactic social color as in 'Star Wars,' though, by a long sight). Simon Pegg the English actor plays Scotty with a real Scottish brogue and a peppy comical manner. Anton Yelchin who is really a young Russian-born actor but grew up here and speaks perfect English, does a funny but accurate Russian accent as the 17-year-old navigator, Chekhov. John Cho, who plays the Asian crew member Hikaru Sulu, is the quite amusing guy who plays Harold in the 'Harold and Kumar' comedies, but he's not very amusing here. I was surprised to see Winona Rider was in the cast. I thought she might have been the green floozy, but she turns out to have played Spock's human mother. I know nothing about the guy who plays the young Spock. He is not interesting. But Leonard Nimoy himself, the original Spock, is on hand to play the old Spock, who returns from the future to help out. That is a lovely touch, though the writers have to get tangled up in a time warp to stage it.Eric Bana as the evil leader Nero is fine, if you don't mind that all his cohorts look pretty much identical to him--all swarthy, shaven-headed, tattooed leathermen. The contrast with the bright-eyed dazzlingly-lit world of the Enterprise reminds me of the Drapes and Squares of my high school, or the Greasers and Soscs of S.E. Hinton's 'The Outsiders.' How is it that the proper good-boy spaceships are by NASA out of Mies van der Rohe, while Nero's are like rough-hewn medieval sculpted weapons? You kind of have to like the originality of the Nero vessels, but they don't look very aerodynamic.It seems to be the rule now that when a blockbuster is half decent, the flacks rush in with raves when it's barely out of the can. I'd side more with Anthony Lane ('This new 'Star Trek' is nonsense, no question. . .but at least it's not boggy nonsense' or Roger Ebert ('you want space opera, you got it').",7,3,11,12 May 2009
Monster," Dark journey: extraordinary performance
","This recreation of a Florida female serial killer's true story is nasty, brutish, and short. Yet the movie is one to be seen, both for the strength of the acting and the originality of the material.The film and the acting have been compared to Hilary Swank and Boys Don't Cry.  Both performances are remarkable works of sympathy and embodiment involving real life stories of lesbian relationships. But Swank's character was a young woman who made herself into an attractive young man and her brutal end was sweetened for her because Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena achieved, if briefly, the bliss of living a lifelong dream.  Aileen Wuornos (Theron) is a beat-up, weather-beaten women who never achieves more than a few moments of happiness, and who instead is hell-bent on shaping her own doom.We first encounter Wuornos when she meets her soon-to-be female companion and lover Selby (Christina Ricci) in a Florida lesbian dive bar. Down to her last few dollars, the suicidal Lee, who lives the grim life of a car hooker, hooks up with Selby: The meeting begins the one tender relationship she has had in her whole life.Briefly we see her make pathetic stabs at finding a better life, but her grim appearance and her instant rages make her a hopeless job interview. Paradoxically, the newfound power of being in love leads to Lee's doom; it emboldens her to kill so she and her girlfriend can live better.
The narrative slides from bar to motel to vile rental house to car sex and death scene as the movie rushes headlong toward a disaster engineered by Wuornos, with Selby in tow.  Aside from a few moments when the cinematography turns a damp twilight into an instant of dark poetry, the movie offers few grace notes. It's relentless. All the roadside pickups are shot in the same dark, damp twilight. The cinematography could have been less monotonous; but at least it has the virtue of highlighting Theron's performance and underlining the claustrophobia of the life.People exclaim at the pretty Theron's physical transformation and this is the great novelty of the film. In movies like The Astronaut's Wife and The Italian Job and James Gray's excellent, brooding The Yards, Theron plays the dewy-eyed, shapely blonde a young man wants to have on his arm.  How did she become this prematurely aged, broken-down wreck of a woman? The actress underwent lengthy makeup sessions and prepared for the role by putting on 35 pounds. She learned to mimic the way the real Wuornos looked and moved by watching footage of interviews used in the documentary, Aileen:  Portrait of a Serial Killer.In her embodiment of Wuornos, Theron walks and stands with shoulders and head back, chest out, legs spread, hair flipped back like a mane; mouth turned down, eyes frowning and glaring, face a succession of pouts and grins.  Her patter pours out of her uncontrollably. From her first moment onscreen she's a doomed life force, sputtering with nervous energy and self-destructive menace.  It's not only an amazing embodiment, it's a compulsive one to watch.Typical of the detractors, one of the Voice's clever-hip flacks describes this as `an Oscar-angling performance that swings from muscularly sympathetic to pre-Extreme Makeover crass. . .' She says  `the bulked-up, butch-struttin', perma-frownin' Theron is poised to ride the tribulations of state-executed Florida prostitute and john-snuffing serial killer Aileen Wuornos straight to Slingbladin' Hilary Swankdom.' That's clever, isn't it? But so mean spirited it needs no comment. More thoughtfully, veteran film critic Michael Sragow recently wrote in commenting on the Oscars that, `the Academy tends to over-value performers who break with established images (like Charlize Theron in Monster) or adopt disguises (like Nicole Kidman in The Hours) or accents (like Meryl Streep in anything). And the Academy tends to undervalue performers who dig deep into their own personalities and screen personae and find something revelatory and new.'
That's true, and it's the underlying reason why people downgrade Theron's inspired work in Monster to a blatant Oscar bid.  That's a gross error. The Academy's biases shouldn't be allowed to detract from Theron's accomplishment.  Neither Monster nor Boys Don't Cry is just a screen test to show off an acting tour de force.  Monster isn't as strong a film as Boys Don't Cry, but it too is a brilliant collaboration between director and actors, with a thoroughly involving screenplay.It's been said that Ricci's acting is inadequate and weakens the movie. This is another error. Ricci thoroughly understands her character.  Selby is a nervous, shy, weak person, only 18 when the movie begins and struggling to find an identity.  With Lee she becomes a kvetch, a passive-aggressive detractor, while she needily clings to Lee and her un-keep-able promises. She's terribly insecure and naive. Ricci doesn't inject any unwonted irony or sophistication into Selby.  It's a real and touching, yet chilling, performance - as well as a selfless and perceptive one.Bruce Dern, as Lee Wuornos' one friend, a ravaged, alcoholic Vietnam veteran, manages to seem a good deal less mannered and quirky and more sympathetic than has sometimes been the case in past roles.  Minor characters - the succession of johns and victims - are disturbingly authentic.There's a terrible compulsion about watching this movie.  The two lead actresses (despite Ricci's more familiar look) are breathtakingly authentic. Lee believes men are beasts and from her angle it looks that way:  her first kill is a particularly evil, violent man who would have killed her. Eventually we see her murder a gentle soul who only wanted to help her. She's on a roller coaster ride now, acting out her terrible anger at men and life.  Her murders are also robberies and for a while Lee and Selby feel rich.  Eventually Lee unknowingly kills a cop and from then on she's unable to cover her tracks.  Selby escapes prosecution by ratting on her lover and companion.That's it:  this is an ugly, sad story, worth watching for the feat of acting that will earn Charlize Theron lasting recognition, and for a look at the darkest side of life.",Null,0,0,5 February 2004
Inglourious Basterds," A wealth of almost-themes and lush production values, amazing cast, a must-see
","Tarantino's World War II feature Inglourious Basterds shows the director's best and worst features, but in a wholly new setting. Here is his propensity for sectioned films (there are five 'chapters') with disparate plots with neat but wildly implausible interconnections. His love of elaborate extended set pieces where the dialogue takes over, sometimes at excruciating length. He casts playfully and ingeniously and provides his actors irresistible opportunities to strut their stuff. He's a master of old-fashioned camera-work, with bold and traditional uses of big close-ups. He tries out some pretty fancy production pieces, notably gun battles and a classic old movie theater rigged up for a Nazi gala, and these are never less than colorful and delightful eye candy. The new twist is the swing to Europe -- German-occupied France -- with tons of subtitled French and German dialogue, and even translating back and forth between them. A big question is this: can we really stomach a partly comic, partly grandiose, partly grind-house version of the war European filmmakers and at least all older Europeans still take deadly seriously? Can World War II be the basis for a movie about movies so fanciful that it seeks to resolve the war in that old Paris cinema with a host of Nazi bigwigs all on hand for a propaganda film? Besides the Dirty Dozen team of American Jews headed up by Brad Pitt's southern redneck and charged, as viewers of the movie trailer will well remember, to bring back 'Nazi scalps' (a hundred each, in fact) -- something a little in the vein of Samuel Fuller's 1980 saga Big Red One, once planned in this long-contemplated project as a 16-episode TV series -- there's a not-so-secondary dual theme of concealment and identity. The movie begins at a French dairy farm with a visit from the most impressive and despicable character, Col. Hans Landa (played with relish and equal linguistic skill in French, English and German by Austrian Christoph Waltz Waltz), who's nickname is 'the Jew Hunter.' The farmer is hiding Jews, and Landa finds them -- but it all happens in dialogue, followed by a violent rain of bullets. One of the hidden family escapes alive, Shoshanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), who reappears improbably several years later as the proprietor of a Paris cinema, having taken on a French Christian name.This sequence is excruciating enough, but less so than one in which an English OSS officer's posing as a Nazi officer, Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender), is gradually smoked out in a cellar bar. At that point the excruciating becomes hard to separate from the tedious. And then three's the German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diana Kruger), undercover for the Allies, who's caught out later like a doomed Cinderella, by a shoe that fits. Meanwhile there are several Germans who pose as Nazis while their real aim is to kill Nazis, and there is young German war hero Fredrick Zoller ( Daniel Brühl), fluent in French, and in love with Shoshanna as well as with movies -- and he becomes a movie star, beginning by playing himself in a propaganda film . The ingenuity and parallelisms are so fascinating one wishes identity were made more resonant as a theme.Another theme or Tarantino fetish much on display here is for deal-making. The dairy farmer is bargained with. Lt. Aldo Raine (Pitt -- the name a homage to veteran war movie actor Aldo Ray) is ready to bargain with Nazis, letting them keep their lives and their scalps if they'll give up German military information. Col. Hans Lada makes the biggest deal of all -- his life for, well, the Third Reich, basically.A big element is the celebration of movies, not only by the climax in a movie house, but in the constant references to old ones, to the point that Inglourious Basterds, the title itself a deliberate corruption of the name of a schlock Italian WWII film, becomes more than anything about old war movies. At times the whole effort gets mired in material that is too familiar -- the nasty Nazis, the drinking scenes, the face offs, the suspenseful plots -- material that has been done better and with more gravitas elsewhere. Quentin Tarantino's movies have never been about 'reality.' They're ingenious fantasies, built up out of cinema, delighting in the magic of what can happen on the screen.But World War II was always movies, too, and propaganda. The 'Basterds' -- the team of Jews out to give individual Nazis horrible deaths -- are a propaganda weapon. And so is the movie 'Nation's Pride,' made starring Zoller, depicting how he singlehandedly killed 300 men, And Tarantino gives us something it's surprising he's not done before, a movie-within-a-movie. Zoller calls himself 'the German Sgt. York.' Tarantino does not resist the temptation (how could he?) to put his versions of Goebbels (a very juicy Sylvester Groth) as well as Hitler, and even, off in the corner of a scene, Churchill, on the screen.Also present is the quintessential Tarantino theme: revenge. The 'basterds' are having revenge for the annihilation of Jews. Zoller's insistence that the premiere be transferred to Shoshanna's cinema gives her the opportunity to wreak vengeance on a whole auditorium full of Nazis for the brutal killing of her family.Things get very complicated when three plots by the British, the 'Basterds,' and Shoshanna (with her black French boyfriend Marcel (Jacky Ido) all converge on the premiere of 'Nation's Pride' at Shoshann's theater, with some confusion of the continuity in this event.Whether or not you buy the whole thing, the production is lush, the acting is rich, and there's a fascinating interweaving of almost-themes. Waltz carries the day, but Pitt, with his down-home shtick, though it's not as funny or as vivid as stuff in Full Metal Jacket, is still quite entertaining, and he too gets his chance to put on a (comically clumsy) fake identity. Troubling, drawn-out--and not to be missed.",9,7,20,6 August 2009
Iron Man 2," 'The man in the iron irony'
","Let's not fall over ourselves too much trying to define the merits and faults of this film and comparing it to 'Iron Man 1.' I'd rather just look at the new one and see if we can tease out any new ideas and angles.The 'Iron Man' stories begin with the happy union of technology and business, and have a protagonist unlike the meek, altruistic sort of comic book super hero. Tony Stark is the son of a corporate giant, born rich (though unloved), a profligate rogue, a wild playboy. He is the slightly rotten fruit of big-time capitalist success, the second generation that doesn't give a damn and just wants to have fun. However, he is also his father's son, gifted with a gigantic ego and also a genius, and so he has a heroic role forced upon him. Being a valuable commodity, he is kidnapped, and must escape by building a suit of hi-tech body armor instead of the mega-weapon his captors want. He suffers severe heart injuries in the process, thus becoming vulnerable at the same moment that he rises to super power. And with the vulnerability, the genius, and the growing power, he makes it clear that he remains the devil-may-care playboy.Later Stark is inspired to adopt his extraordinary creation, with him inside it, in the interests of protecting mankind. In the comics the enemy was communism. Now (in the first 'Iron Man' movie) it's terrorism and a rival within Stark Industries who would take it over, the evil Obadiah Stane, played by Jeff Bridges. In 'Iron Man 2,' the enemies are two: a foolish prancing peacock of an upstart industrialist competitor, Justin Hammer (an excellent Sam Rockwell), who wants to eliminate Stark and his company and have his, not Tony's, exo-skeletal weaponry be what the Pentagon exclusively buys and uses; and a dangerous maverick Russian, half criminal, half tech wizard, with bad memories of Tony's father. This individual, Ivan Vanko (a brilliantly used Mickey Rourke), winds up unwillingly serving Justin Hammer, but breaks out on his own in time to do battle with Stark and Hammer, allied.I think it's safe to say screenwriter Justin Theroux is having some fun with the sacrosanct values of the original Cold War era comic source of Iron Man. Capitalism's worst excesses are mocked through the smugness of Justin Hammer, with his constant preening that's always shown up as pointless, and through Tony's own boasts, most of all the stunner, 'I have successfully privatized world peace!' This declaration comes at a donnybrook Senate hearing supervised by a smiling nonentity of a committee chairman (Garry Shandling) at which Stark manages to commandeer the room's visual system and make a mockery of efforts by Iran, North Korea, and Hammer to copy his Iron Man suits. That's a provocative statement. Privatizing warfare (i.e., in Orwellian terms, 'world peace') brings to the liberal mind horrible thoughts of Blackwater and its ilk. Such warfare is a definite, real-life Bush era trend. Privatizing world peace, on the other hand, may sound like a good idea if it takes away from nation states their capacity to wage perpetual war. Unfortunately such privatizing would (and does) also undermine the authority of the principled international bodies that attempt to maintain order.Theroux also has fun this time with foreign threats, as an aspect of Pentagon (and war-industry-promoted) paranoia, which were taken so seriously in the first Iron Man film with its evil Middle Easterners in caves forging weapons. This time the foreign enemy, spouting Russian words and a creditable accent, covered in tattoos, with a pet cockatoo, an S&M outfit, and lashing Formula One racing cars to pieces with electric whips, is...Mickey Rourke! Right out of 'The Wrestler, but looking happy and tan since his recent comeback. But it's hard to say whether the flurry caused by Rourke's deliciously absurd Ivan Vanko is satire on right wing paranoia or the frivolity of spinning out quirky villains à la Ian Fleming (whose politics were not deep, or congruent with today's realities). ' Above all the 'ideas' of either 'Iron Man' movie, whether serious or frivolous, looms the by now seemingly inimitable and essential personality of Robert Downey Jr., who as Tony Stark gets to play endlessly creative riffs off the kind of outrageous, funny but dangerous, clever but seriously unwise person he was in his own real life as a heavy substance abuser and party boy whose using got him into constant trouble and finally prison, treatment, and sobriety. He gets to fulfill the A.A. Promise, 'We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.' In playing Tony Stark, Downey gets to relive his past, without the alcohol, pot, coke, or heroin. When he was on the downward path of the addict he was doing some of the most important research into his role. That research is why he can so easily access the outrageousness and edgy wit of Tony Stark. This role is sometimes seen as a surprising outcome of Downey's comeback, coming after serious stuff like 'A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints;' 'Good Night, and Good Luck;' 'A Scanner Darkly;' and 'Zodiac.' But Tony Stark is really quite logical, representing the addict's fantasies of glory as well as his self-scrutiny. When Tony's told at the end of 'Iron Man 2' that he's been diagnosed as a classic narcissistic personality, he readily agrees. Any connection with the personality of the typical corporate CEO is, of course, purely coincidental. Not for nothing does the 'New York Times' critic A.O. Scott's review of 'Iron Man 2' begin with the heading 'The Man in the Iron Irony.'",8,0,1,8 May 2010
Lords of Dogtown," Gnarly live
","Movies of this kind aren't usually this good. They tend to look cheesy and have corny plots that slink toward clichéd payoffs. 'Lords of Dogtown' instead has compelling cinematography and staging, a dynamic, non-stop physicality, and consistently fine acting. In the end, don't expect profundity or perfection, but do look for the strong evocation of a lifestyle and an era. In the Seventies when skateboarding first exuded magic and became a maverick sport with stars, a whole school of wide angle photography grew up to do justice to their gravity-defying feats for skateboard magazines, and this film is shot with wide angle lenses to evoke that look and capture the feats appropriately.Front and center there's a cast that delivers. As Skip, the gnarly, drunken surfboard shop owner who starts the Venice Zephyrs team on the path to skateboard greatness, Heath Ledger, out of chain mail and away from romantic lighting, is deep into his character and evidently having lots of fun. In fact it's clear everybody working on the picture had a ball. Emile Hirsch, playing badboy spark to the whole sport Jay Adams, shows again what a gifted actor he is: his pouting, sensuous performance is something to watch. John Robinson, the poster boy for Van Sant's Elephant, is Stacy Peralta, the straight-arrow of the trio of stars who emerge, whose real life counterpart wrote the film script and made the earlier documentary 'Dogtown and Z Boys.' With his gorgeous long straight blond hair, peaches-and-cream cheeks, and Colgate smile, he's a perfect skateboarding valedictorian and a commanding and deft physical presence in what is totally a movie about balls, individualism, and grace. Victor Rasuk, who starred in the lovely little coming of age film 'Raising Victor Vargas,' rises to the very different task here of being the bold, commercial, flashy Mexican American Tony Alva, skateboarding's first world champion. As Jay's sad surf sister burnout mom, Rebecca de Mornay is brave and believable. Ledger and Hirsch walk away with the acting prizes but John Robinson and the other principals are striking presences. These strong, distinctive performances are part of an energetic ensemble piece with many minor unnamed characters seamlessly filling in the background.In her debut Thirteen, director Catherine Hardwicke showed her ability to eavesdrop realistically on at-risk teenagers and their maturity-challenged parents. Dogtown isn't such a different milieu, but it's also a history of how skateboarding became popular and, for some, worth a lot of money.Hardwicke famously did a literal headbanger in an empty swimming pool while directing the movie and was out for several minutes, scaring skateboarding crew members, who afterward declared, 'Now you're one of us.' 'Lords of Dogtown' is a direct companion piece to Peralta's documentary, whose story it brings to vivid life. The decaying Venice pier looms over the early scenes. It's a kind of off limits surfing slum where the boys and their chicks dash to ride waves between pylons and rocks. They jump off a roof, stop traffic, and skateboard down to the ocean in the first high-kinetic shots with long Seventies surfboards in hand. Only Peralta, excluded from the Zephyrs at first for having a job, drives his own car. Their parents are alcoholic burnouts and they come from sleezy little surfside broken homes except for young Sid, a baby-faced poor little rich boy and 'maggot,' the dedicated dogbody and punching bag at the surfboard shop, with an inner ear problem, a camp follower who turns into the 'family's' beloved mascot and martyr.Once they enter competitions with an earthy new style of skateboarding and athletic gifts that blow away the crowds and turn on the girls, one by one the Zephyr's stars are lured away from the 'family' by well funded promoters. Jay rejected that path. One day Jay shaves off his bleach-blond tresses and becomes a punk. Ultimately he went to jail like later skateboard stars Mark Anthony 'Gator' Ragowski, who was documented in Helen Sickler's 'Rise and Fall of Gator,' and the once dashing Christian Hosoi. Jay lures away Stacy's foxy Latina girlfriend in a stunning sequence of coy playfulness and sinuous movements: the dudes' physicality flows out of their derring-do on wheels into their moves with the girls.There are accidents, beatings, triumphs, and a tragic death. Through it all Heath Ledger as Skip is a buzzing obligato, crazy, stoned, funny but also threatening. Another thread in the film is the raids on rich people's empty pools to skate them in long, flowing, interwoven infinity signs, till little lookouts yell 'pig' or 'dog' and they all flee, knocking down cops in their path. These bold dangerous runs, worth it for the thrill of the concrete curves and the challenge to explore new shapes, are a badge of the Z Boys' 'pirate' outlaw identity and Tony Alva, a closing title declares, continues to raid pools today as an enduring star and amazing lifelong athlete.I don't know if the actors do a lot of their own skateboarding but if they don't Hardwicke sure makes it look like they do. She also has a way of jumping into sequences already in progress, thus avoiding clumsy exposition, except for a few titles for landmark competitions. The movie escapes the stilted flavor of its genre and gets in a lot of real-sounding dialogue and facial expressions instead. The final sequence is a touching reunion that's both funny and sad.",8,0,13,4 June 2005
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Schlubby meets louche
","The Judd Apatow comedy machine has ground out another one. It's middling, not as sharp and on target as 41 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, or Superbad, but not as tiresome and lame as Dewey Cox and Drillbit Taylor. Again, the--for Apatow--seminal TV series 'Freaks and Geeks' gets mined. (First-time director Stoller has co-authored some things with Apatow.) 'Freaks' alumnus Jason Segel wrote and stars as TV composer Peter Bretter, dumped by girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). Peter does the 'music' (mostly just ominous sounds) for a sleazy crime series featuring Sarah. She's taken up with decadent (but clean and sober) English rock star Aldous Snow, played by Russell Brand, an outrageous Brit comic whose real life junkie confessions are a hoot. Brand takes us away from Apatow's limited world of fat Jewish boys trying to get laid with hot chicks. His Aldous Snow is a sleazy sex god and recovery guru and when he's on screen, things take a welcome new turn toward wit and absurdity.But that comes briefly, and later. We begin in Hollywood, where Sarah comes to see the couch potato Peter, who refuses to put on clothes to hear her breaking up speech. Despondent, Peter follows advice from his brother Brian (Bill Hader of Knocked Up and Superbad) and goes to Hawaii, where his waiter is Apatow warhorse Jonah Hill and his reefer-addled surf instructor is 'Friends' and Apatow alum Paul Rudd. Who should be at Peter's hotel but Sarah and Aldous? With the questionable linchpin of this lame 'surprise,' comedy, heartbreak, and resolution ensue.There are no jaw-breaking laughs. In fact the only things that kept me watching were the appeal of Segel--he's a giant, slightly overweight puppy dog--and the louche Brit pungently evoked by Russell Brand. As for the Hawaiian setting, Oahu may have been a fun place to shoot. The Apatow crew probably wanted out of Hollywood. But the Pacific is too soggy and pretty an environment for repartee. For a change, instead of female nakedness (oh, just a few bare breasts), Segel is frontally nude, repeatedly, but just for a split second each time.Apatow's posse is at home with male adolescence and early--or frozen--schlub-hood. But not with much else; the Apatow-sponsored features haven't managed to match the depth and breadth of their mother lode, 'Freaks and Gesks.' In the TV series, Segel got dumped by none other than Lindsey (Linda Cardellini), the lead character. None of the film comedies have come up with a female as smart, sensible, interesting, and central as Lindsay. Sarah is a pathetic sliver of humanity by comparison. Lindsey went out with Segel's 'Freaks' persona Nick out of pity, and when he got too intense, she pulled away. His suffering was convincing, a little disturbing even. Her choice was wise. This sequence was less formulaic than Sarah Marshall. Nick, Segel's character in 'Freaks' is rather arresting.Peter grows out of Nick but loses rather than gains depth in the updating. The exotic setting obviously doesn't compensate. Segel already had musical ambitions as Nick, who realizes he's no rock star. Peter hates his sellout TV composing and is working on a Dracula puppet opera--an odd curio performed in excerpt toward the end. As before, Segel's appealing as a would-be artist and a basically decent but weak fellow with his heart on his sleeve, but Nick had more emotional conviction than Peter.Sarah Marshall spends most of its time on well-trodden territory with hits predictable surprises, obtrusive local color, romance opportunities, and obligatory attempts at reconciliation. It does have laughs, but while Peter's new girlfriend Rachel (Mila Kunis) like him is basically a decent person, she mostly comes off as little more than a pretty face, and their relationship is never more than the stuff of sitcoms. In the end it seems that Segel's character lacks the complexity--or the energy--to sustain a whole movie, and he and Sarah are equally forgettable. _________________",7,8,18,20 April 2008
Shaun of the Dead," No more 'zed word' for now
","Shaun of the Dead is an English send-up of the zombie genre which also evokes some of the climactic moments of such classics as George Romero's Night of the Living Dead. The paradox is that while the movie's saying the genre's kaputt, it's also showing how viable it still is, because its own main energy comes from standard zombie situations: the world gone mad, streets full of stumbling, hungry ghouls, people running out of places to hide; your mum getting bitten and 'turned' and having to shoot her. So the genre's like a zombie too: it dies here, but in dying comes back to fresh sinister life. The initial joke is twofold. Shaun (co-author Simon Pegg) and his slob roommate Ed (Nick Frost) don't notice the 'zed' invasion at first because they're such lazy, incompetent slackers. But they also don't notice it simply because they're true Brits: English sangfroid is another thing keeping them from seeing anything gone wrong in the streets of North London. It's just bad form to notice other people's mess, even when that mess entails corpses in the street and blood all over the door of the convenience store fridge. When Shaun's stepfather's been bitten, since he's the steely Bill Nighy, the old boy keeps on making sense. What more can Shaun's mum do but make a nice cup o' tea? This is a hymn both to slacker virtue and to muddling through. The filmmakers draw enough humor out of Shaun, Ed, their less friendly roommate Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), Shaun's disappointed girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), and Liz's self righteous best friends Dianne and David (Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran) to create solid scenes throughout where zombies aren't needed except as a buzzing, gurgling chorus outside the walls forcing the group to keep together and be brave. Shaun of the Dead is also the story of an underdog hero. Physically Shaun is like Vince (Craig Kelly) in the original English 'Queer As Folk,' but without quite Vince's level of charm. Like Vince, Shaun's shy, deferential, and not the most dashing guy around, but inside there's a plucky, reliable survivor just waiting to be let out. For quite a while Shaun and Ed generate smiles with how despite constant radio and TV coverage they manage to disregard the zombie invasion in favor of electro music and video games. They've got to discover a girl ghoul in their own garden, which happens after an all night drunk to forget Liz's rejection of Shaun, before they finally get the picture. Their immediate reaction to the stumbling, menacing, staring creature is to think she's drunk too, but then the dead-fish eyes and bloody mouth are a tip-off. This is the best moment - when the first really horrible thing happens, but the pals are still arguing over which classic vinyl disk they can spare from their collection to bash out the zombie's brains with.Once Shaun and Ed have joined the fray and Shaun turns into a hero, leading his little band to that center of English (and slacker) life, the local pub, the film becomes in many ways a standard zombie flick, except that it's a bit brighter and more character-driven. The ending looks just as conventionally apocalyptic as any of Romero's at first. But there's a sequel six month later, where Shaun and Liz have survived and live together (Ed and Pete got 'turned'), and remaining zombies have been kept around to be used for industrial jobs and certain sports. The unambitious day ending at the pub that defined Shaun is now Liz's idea of a good time too: through his heroism in defending the fortress of the Winchester, he has restated and reaffirmed English values as his own. Without the last good laugh of the postscript that turns zombies into a joke again where it was in the opening sequences, the movie would have succumbed to the genre it's offing. Instead zombie movies have been put to rest. For now. This isn't a great film but it's a cheery one and more coherent than Danny Boyle's popular 28 days Later, which was all flash and no follow-through.",Null,0,1,1 November 2004
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," No disappointments here
","C.S. Lewis encouraged his friend Tolkien with his imaginative writing, but the favor was not returned. As his elaborate system in Lord of the Rings shows, Tolkien obviously liked to create a world that was an internally closed system. He didn't like the way Lewis worked in whatever familiar customs or myths fell to hand. Narnia most notably incorporates central aspects of Christianity; it's also a world where the children the stories are for enter the story, just as Lewis Carroll's pet child Alice Liddell enters his fantasy world in Through the Looking-Glass  in Narnia's case, obviously, through a wardrobe. Lewis's and Carroll's books also have in common talking animals, though the Narnia ones aren't as droll and crazy as the mathematician's. But Narnia is a wonderful story for children, because it has children who are real, but who become heroes.The first Narnia movie, directed by New Zealand visual effects and Shrek man Andrew Adamson, is perfect in its way. It's almost too perfect: you may wish somebody or something would stand out more. Maybe Tilda Swinton stands out a bit. Unless you recognize Jim Broadbent behind all his whiskers and makeup, Swinton is the only known actor we actually see on screen (Liam Neeson's voice is all too recognizable but it's attached to the Christlike lion, Aslan). Swinton blends in too, though. She's so sure and discreet  and so familiar these days as a wicked sprite (cp. her role in Constantine), even her presence may seem routine. She's even perfectly attired in changing outtits for each scene or season to help her blend in. But she deserves credit, as usual, for her integrity. She plays her role with absolute seriousness and poise. There's no cuteness about it.The children, Georgie Henley as Lucy, Skandar Keynes as Edmund, William Moseley as Peter, and Susan Prevensie as Anna Popplewell, a most carefully chosen quartet, are charming, distinctive, and very good actors. Somehow the boys seem to carry the action, while the girls carry the feeling.The movie is like a big beautiful toy box. The children and the animals come out and do their things, the white witch has her great battle with the forces of Aslan, and then they go away and we feel cozy and satisfied like a child who's been read to in bed and dozes off, dreaming of snow in a warm room.Like the classic Conrad Aiken short story 'Silent Snow, Secret Snow,' the winter world of Narnia may grow out of a child's sense that snow is magical and unreal, beautiful but perilous. The snowy landscape of the film is enveloping and lovely, and it doesn't matter if it's real or not.People may take Aslan, the lion of God, differently, but nobody in his right mind can avoid the fact that what happens to him makes him like Christ and his slaughter like the Crucifixion, and his rising back to life off a big slab of stone that cracks like the Resurrection. And the two girls mourning over his body are the two Marys. And young Peter, the King and leader of the army of the good, is St. Peter, the founder of Christ's Church. C.S. Lewis was an adult convert whose enthusiasm for Christianity was so great he had to tell. But one can see Tolkien's point. This is what stands out: the Christian symbolism walks away with the story and spoils it a bit; Tolkien had a point.Or maybe it's that, seeing all these symbols in a movie simplified, reduced to music and visuals and the voice of Liam Neeson, no longer working solely through the supple language of C. S. Lewis, robs them of some of their original literary mystery and resonance. Once again the adaptation of a book into a film, while making it lovely and vivid for us, has diminished something that in words is accessible to all, more subtle and complex.The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a wonder, a delightful film, but it hasn't the visual richness of Lord of the Rings, nor has the story the complexity of Tolkien's elaborate mythology, or its immense variety, its real magic  though with the Harry Potter series running dry, it looks fresh. It's bright and shiny, like a Christmas tree ornament. It's a huge project nonetheless, as you see when you watch the credits of Narnia roll. Like Kill Bill's they go on so long the audience is long gone and the cleanup crew is well on its way to getting all the pop cups and corn bags and wrappers gathered up and the floor swept before the names have stopped scrolling. There are complete crews for Los Angeles, Czechoslovakia, Poland, New Zealand, Guatemala, and the San Francisco Bay Area, and special effects people for each location. I wonder what an Oxford don would have made of all that.Tilda Swinton is the best androgynous sprite ever, but it's time (here's a plug for the small project) for her to do more roles like the needy mother in Mike Mills's Thumbsucker. She may have taken home a smaller paycheck, but she delivered way more humanity. As for the great battles in The Chronicles of Narnia, they fade quickly from the mind. Better than anything else are the tender early scenes between Mr. Tumnus, the fawn (James McAvoy), and young Lucy. Those who know the book much better than I do tend to say the first part of it is the best. The battle of good and evil may be too much to take in on first viewing, and may sink in when the other parts come out. This is not a great film, but it's impeccable. And the early scenes will stay in the mind a long time. _________________",8,7,10,29 December 2005
Public Enemies," The devil is in the details
","It's as hard to get a grip on Mann's impressive but vaguely off-putting new movie about John Dillinger's last thirteen months as it is to project yourself into the coldly beautiful digital images. The title itself provides a clue to the problem: it doesn't focus on the star criminal embodied by the charismatic and -- here -- coolly dashing Johnny Depp, whose quips and provocations in the trailer draw us into the theater to see him, only him, and his bold exploits. It points instead to the wider focus of Mann's book source -- 'Vanity Fair' writer Bryan Burroughs' 600 pages of meticulous research, 'Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34.' Relentless G-man Purvis (a convincing but bloodless Christian Bale) and his rising boss FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup, both droll and period) are part of another story as important as the bank robber's final wide ride, the story of the growing cruelty and relentlessness of the forces of American law.Look at another title of a movie about a doomed but spectacular crime spree: Arthur Penn's 'Bonnie and Clyde.' That 1967 classic works so well because it's character-driven. Even in the sketchy but powerful scenes that outline John Dillinger's romance with French-Native American hatcheck girl Billie Frechette (Marion Cottillard, working wonders with limited material), character is subsidiary to function: 'I rob banks,' Johnny says. And then: 'What else you need to know?' Well, quite a lot, actually, for a rounded character to emerge. Mann's movie is meticulous as to period look, to facade, but not to essence. Its street scenes are full of detail, its clothes immaculate and accurate. Taking place in 1933-34, however, it provides too few overt signs of the Great Depression. The film is also misleading in showing the Dillinger gang only robbing grand, marble-hall-and-column banks, when in fact they mostly robbed small and middling sized ones.The overall result is a collection of contradictions. There is romance, but the effect isn't romantic. There's precise realism, but the overall effect isn't realistic. Perhaps the only unmitigated pleasure that remains is the images, the digital with its cold precision, its crisp edges even when many of the cameras are jiggly and hand-held, the depth of detail in darkness, the color that is neither bright nor faded, the sheer satisfying crispness of everything and everybody. And in this one aspect, a sublimely heightened vérité whose look is something quite new, 'Public Enemies' matches 'Bonnie and Clyde:' it makes us feel we're seeing period scenes with contemporary eyes. The best and most memorable images are the complex ones you won't see in stills where many actors are running back and forth in front of the camera, the gunshots are popping realistically in every direction, and there is no hint of the usual film chiaroscuro or highlighting, but the light is somehow beautiful. The cameras move too much, but they do rub your face in the action. What's gong on you may figure out later.Maybe you can't avoid mythologizing when you shoot a movie about a famous Thirties bank robber and shouldn't try to, but Mann does. He's working, with great accomplishment, from that meticulous historical account, involving dozens of players on both the cop and the crook sides. Dillinger (and alternatively the totally unappealing Purvis) stay in the foreground. But there too is a contradiction, because the way Depp plays his part, witty, cold, and focused rather than warm and down-to-earth, his character ends up being impressive, but ultimately absent. (Contrast Warren Beatty's impotence and blinking charm as Clyde Barrow, an absence you yet want to cuddle.) Even when the characters are strong in Public Enemies, they don't get enough chance to interact. Dillinger is rarely with Frechette. His chance to confront Purivs is too brief, the moment when Purvis tells him he's to be extradited to Indiana and he quips, 'There's absolutely nothing I want to do in Indiana.' He's not facing off Purvis; he's playing to the audience.This should have been one of the showpieces of the season, and it is indeed a blockbuster with class in a world of junk. Its virtuoso look and complexly orchestrated scenes will hold up with time, but despite a freshness in approaching familiar genre material, it's missing that certain 'je ne sais quoi.' Even though it's different, it lacks style, movie-making panache, playfulness, suspense, the ability to push a climax, the capacity to take a breather so the momentum builds up again. There's an impressive twittering machine functioning here on all its Ford V8 cylinders. But the light touch is missing, the capacity to make you say 'Yeah!', to simultaneously stand apart and admire while utterly caught up in it all.",8,40,55,5 July 2009
Oldboy," Revenge: a dish best eaten live?
","In Park Chan-wook's 'Oldboy' (which won the grand prize at Cannes in 2004 when Tarantino was at the helm), a rough-looking man is held by the cops for some hours after a drunk. A series of relentless jump-cuts show him misbehaving at the police station. Once bailed out, he suddenly disappears in a pour-down rain while his rescuer is in a phone booth. The next we know he's imprisoned in a tiny apartment-like jail cell, and is held there for.fifteen years! Again jump cuts take us through this experience, which includes pumped-in gas while he sleeps, self-tattoos of cross-hatching to remind himself of the years, a journal, a constant TV which is his only companion, imaginary swarms of insects, and personal martial-arts conditioning that includes punching the wall till his knuckles bleed.Once released, having a taste for something other than the pot-stickers he was served all the time in his prison, our man stops at a sushi bar and asks for 'something live.' He's brought an octopus as big as two fists and he gobbles it -- live -- and passes out. The female sushi chef presiding at this event bonds with the man and they go looking for whoever imprisoned him and try to find out why. I forgot a man who jumps off the roof of the prison building before this: but nobody could keep track of all the hyper-kinetic, dark, grungy contents of 'Oldboy.' It's in Korean, by the way, and if you don't know Korean you may miss a bit of the dialog. It's got those subtitles that fade when the background's light, and they flick by pretty fast too.What is clear is that as somebody taunts him, Oh Dae-Su's just in a larger prison when his captors let him out, and what he does is part of a maniacal scheme to do him far worse harm than mere physical confinement.What's initially endearing about this accomplished but cartoon-like revenge-mystery action film, apart from Choi Min Sik's gonzo performance as Oh Dae-Su, the imprisoned man who turns sushi freak, is its obsessiveness, which Choi's intensity neatly underlines. The troubles begin when you realize that however maniacally determined Oh Dae-Su's pursuit of his tormentor and unraveling of his imprisonment's secrets are, it's all ultimately lost on us because it makes little logical, and even less emotional, sense. Or, where it does make sense, it's patently impossible.Park Chan Wook is a clever and inventive filmmaker who like many of the other 'dark,' 'cool' filmmakers of today has a visual style that outstrips his ability to tell a story. Since you could have said that about The Big Sleep and many still do, it may be that critical head-shaking over 'Oldboy' will seem passé in time and the film will morph into a classic. It's been said already though that Park is pursuing cult status faster than he can keep up with himself.The encrustation of the mechanical upon the living was Bergson's definition of the comic, and by that definition this movie should be a laugh riot. There's both elaborate visual trickery and intense real physicality -- witness Oh Dae-Su's consumption of the octopus. He really bites the thing's head off and chews on the still-writhing tentacles as they nervously coil round his cheek. The martial arts sequences are tricky and complicated; I doubt that the actor is doing all his stunts like Tony Ja in 'Ong-bak: Thai Warrior,' but his physicality is down to earth as he punches out one thug after another. No jumping, just punches and falls. But the images and their sequencing are most artfully manipulated. There's a sex scene, and an erotic scene, and a torture sequence involving dental extractions.How Oh Dae-Su finds people and how people find Oh Dae-Su is pretty confused. There's a vague sense that those tormenting Oh Dae-Su are evil masterminds à la James Bond. They have gangster connections and there's a posh huge penthouse at the end. But our hero seems to have been held in a kind of rent-a-jail cell, and whoever ordered up this treatment was apparently connected with something more mundane than Goldfinger: simply a schoolmate who bears Oh Dae-Su an obscure grudge. When the school enemy appears, if I've got this right, he seems to be a decade or two Oh Dae-Su's junior. Does it matter? Well, cultists of the movie will want to explain everything. But not rest of us, because the people aren't real or specific enough for us to care. Choi Min Sik's a gnarly little dynamo (his wacko behavior fits better here than it did in the artistic biography Chihwaseon) and his nemesis is a tall, cool, godlike personage. That's the point. The contrast is enough.Oldboy has hints of Tarantino and Tarantino's Asian martial arts sources, but although there's a lot of dialog, as far as one can tell the talk is very far from Pulp Fiction's priceless exchanges.You think the idea's unique -- imagine being locked up for fifteen years without explanation -- but then you realize it's not only what happened to Victor Hugo's Jean Valjean, but essentially what happens to a lot of black men in America, only then it isn't the beginning of a hip nightmare film. The imprisonment of black men is the real tale of society's revenge on an undeserving minority, but Oldboy's maniacal and inexplicable personal revenge of one middle class man on another has no social significance; worse yet, it never acquires an emotional one.Director Park Chan Wook is a director to reckon with -- some of Oldboy's sequences are hard to forget -- and he's found a worthy star in Choi Min Sik. But this disturbing, violent movie is clever without being intelligent.",7,97,190,11 April 2005
The Secret in Their Eyes," Too much going on here: a murder mystery with politics, comedy, and romance
","This Argentinian film has many virtues but some serious flaws. Ultimately it winds up being too much of a muchness. Its meandering story line focuses on a murder investigation that spans 25 years. It's carried out by a judicial underling, Benjamin Esposito (film veteran Ricardo DarÃ­n, who starred in both of the late FabiÃ¡n Bielinsky's films) with his (romanticized) alcoholic assistant Pablo Sandoval (the comic Guillermo Francella). Meanwhile the lowly Esposito is (wanly) in love with his judicial boss, the aristocratic Irene MenÃ©ndez Hastings (Soledad Villamil), who arrives with the imprimatur of a US Ivy League education, and eventually becomes a judge.'Eyes' feels a bit like 'Zodiac,' only in Spanish and with too many flashbacks, too much unconvincing aging make-up, a last reel that feels like a trailer, and a saccharine conclusion. Everything is complicated by the corruption of the PerÃ³n dictatorship and its aftermath under PerÃ³n's widow Isabel, because it all begins in the mid 1970's. This is interesting and there might have been more of it it. The repressive regime could have been, but isn't, made to explain everything, the homemade justice, the delayed romance, even Pablo's drunkenness. Disorder and evil might well have been more emphatically shown as contaminating all aspects of life, as they clearly are in the superbly creepy 2008 Pablo Larrain film, 'Tony Manero,' about a petty criminal and John Travolta imitator in PInochet's Chile, vintage 1978.Seen from the viewpoint of flashbacks, because the film begins in the 1990's when Esposito reflects back on earlier events, a young man's beautiful bride, Lilliana Morales (Carla Quevedo), is brutally raped and murdered; we see her only as a Grand Guignol tableau draped over a bed. The husband Ricardo Morales (the stiff Pablo Rago), a bank employee, never gets over it. Something is fishy from the start, when a rival judicial agent tries to pin the deed on a couple of dark-skinned immigrant workers, whom he beats into confessing. How do Esposito and Sandoval know who really is the guy? From the angle of his eyes in an old picture: it seems like something gets lost in translation at this point. Anyway, when the murderer, Isidoro GÃ³mez (the subtly creepy Javier Godino) is tracked down -- and this is when things get lively, with a buoyant, almost Hitchcockian chase and capture in a soccer stadium -- and is dramatically made to confess by Hastings through impugning his manhood -- also a very good scene -- he's released right away because he works for the dictatorship's death squad so 'what he does in his private life doesn't matter.' All this is being reviewed 25 years later when Hastings and Esposito, who've long been separated, meet again and he shows her a 'novel' he's trying to write based on the murder investigation and his involvement in it. So the film, based on a novel by Eduardo Sacheri, is a murder mystery, a love story, a story about memory, a political study, and a buddy picture with comic overtones.The latter may be its best aspect. The film is never more Argentinian or more charming than in its scenes in funky but historic-looking cafÃ©s full of seedy characters in front of tasty plates of hors d'oeuvres, everything drenched in sunlight and shadow, where Esposito goes to brood, or to retrieve Sandoval from one of his drunks. The interiors of houses are cozy and atmospheric too. If only some of the funkiness had been allowed to creep into the scenes around the court and law offices, but they are, doubtless by intent, kept coldly grand and marmoreal. Still, all the staging is ambitious and assured. There is something cozy in the way the story keeps doubling back over itself as well.But Campanella may be a bit too sure of himself, because in time, over the film's 127-minute length, all the leisurely doubling-back, which seemed to suggest a magisterial, almost epic structure, begins to drain away the energy that has fed into the story from the hints of evil, the widower's determination to find the killer, and the comradely investigations of Esposito and Sandoval. You could have built a whole movie out of Sandoval. Unfortunately he doesn't make it through to the end of the picture. Campanella manages to juggle so many balls successfully for a while, but then the murder mystery falters and the makeup starts to show (overly emphasized by a preponderance of tight closeups). A creepy final revelation is followed too hard upon by a late-blooming romance. The romance is the weakest element in the story, too lukewarm and repressed most of the time (understandably, due in part to the social gap between Esposito and Hastings), and its most energetic moment, also its corniest, seems to be only a fantasy. Maybe Eduardo Sacheri makes it all work better in his novel. 'El segreto de sus ojos' has a few very fine scenes and much impeccable acting but the narrative contains kitsch elements that undercut the too limited depiction of the moral and political world of the time that the narratively less ambitious 'Tony Manero' manages so well for 1970's Chile. The film nonetheless won the Goya best picture award in Spain, and soon afterward received the Oscar for Best Foreign picture. But for all its ambition, it's not as successful as Jacques Audiard's 'A Prophet,' which it beat out for the Hollywood award.",8,3,6,6 May 2010
Black Book," Schlockmeister goes home and redoes WWII
","Verhoeven apparently means The Black Book/Zwartboek as a reply to his 1977 film about the Dutch resistance, Soldier of Orange, which he now considers too heroic and unironic. He says this time he was trying to show 'Your enemy can be better than you think and your friends can be much worse than you think;' but this generalization shows the level of subtlety he achieves in this movie isn't very high. A real black book is supposed to have existed but not been found. It was a record of collaboration with the Germans by some elements of the Dutch resistance. The title also apparently refers to the dark side of the resistance that Verhoeven thinks he's conveyed; but pretty early on his film turns into a glitzy, episodic adventure movie that seems like a pastiche of many other war movies we've seen before but with a perky, sexy young Jewish woman playing Mata Hari added in.The Black Book doesn't reduce the Holocaust to lightweight comedy the way the blithe and clueless Roberto Benigni did in his Life Is Beautiful. But it does something just as bad: it makes Nazi persecution of the Jews and European resistance into a carnival of sex, explosions and betrayals. That this is an elaborate and expensive production doesn't keep it from being carelessly conceived and ultimately uninvolving. Verhoeven's heroine, Rachel Stein/Ellis de Vries (Carice van Houten), isn't someone who grimly survives as a wraithlike shadow living in a dark, war-torn world, like Wladyslaw Szpilman, the real-life character Adrien Brody plays in Polanski's moody, harrowing The Pianist. Rachel's more like Solomon Perel, the youth (also a real person) played by Marco Hofschneider in Agnieszka Holland's Europa Europa. Solomon was a Polish Jew in Germany whom we see escape a Nazi pogrom and stay alive through a series of deceptions that include joining the Komosol in Russia and later becoming a member of the Hitler Youth. Europa Europa is a breathless adventure that thrills with the way its hero barely escapes danger. It makes sense as a movie because it's the story of a boy young enough to seem free of responsibility. He's an appealing picaresque Jewish hero (cp. Jerszy Kosinski's faked autobiography, The Painted Bird).But Rachel is grown up, and it's surprising how blank she is as a character. Rachel is even bolder than Solomon, but as an adult, she never stops to question what she's doing, though at some point she must seem as confused and mistaken as the boy collaborator in Louis Malle's Lacombe Lucien. Verhoeven, who became an expatriate schlockmeister in Hollywood in the Eighties and Nineties, has made Rachel's story not so much a personal odyssey as the basis for a veritable carnival of surprises and double-crosses involving German officers and Dutch resistance fighters, the two major ones all-too-similarly resulting in the mowing down of a little mob of ostensible good guys -- first a boatload of Jews escaping the country, then a group of resistance fighters who break into a Gestapo prison to free their brothers and find out they were expected . Escaping past German soldiers early on in an emblematic shot, Rachel bares her legs to them; to escape detection a little later, she enters the train compartment of a high-ranking Gestapo officer and charms him by admiring his stamp collection. A singer before the war, she is all show business and sexual favors. Her Gestapo boyfriend realizes she's Jewish the first time they have sex even though as we're ostentatiously shown, she's bleached her pubic hair to fake blondeness. Somehow she manages to stay at headquarters and sing at a party for Hitler's birthday. This boyfriend, SD officer Ludwig Müntze, is played by the charismatic German actor Sebastian Koch, who was the admirable, but politically conformist, playwright in the East German spy story The Lives of Others. Koch has some of the looks and easy machismo of a Gregory Peck, and his Gestapo man is never seen doing anything but make love to Ellis and try to prevent the execution of captured resistance fighters. Müntze is certainly a new revisionist conception: Nazi officer as adorable hunk. The Gestapo bad boy duties are entirely taken over by two other officers, the shaven-headed opportunist General Kaütner (Christian Berkel) and Günther Franken (Waldemar Kobus, my favorite actor in the movie), who is in charge when the boatload of Jews get mowed down and is a delightfully confident villain who's also a good whistler. Later the members of the resistance who are evil are duly (and dully) revealed; the main one was quite obvious all along because he had such a nice face and such a key position.As Nathan Thrall wrote in The Jerusalem Post, The Black Book 'manages to be simultaneously cloying and relentlessly sadistic. Its bombastic, brass-heavy score and glossy production clash with the somber message Verhoeven aims to convey. But above all, it is the film's tireless Hollywood pacing that makes it feel less like a suspenseful World War II film than a World War II thriller.' Verhoeven claims that his Hollywood years gave him a stronger narrative sense that informed this new European-made movie, but the shadow of Robocop, Basic Instinct, and Showgirls hovers; and 'narrative sense' means shallow characters and fake atmosphere backed up by corny movie music. Black Book has this much in its favor that's non-Hollywood: it features a host of competent European actors speaking the appropriate languages (mainly Flemish and German). The movie is conventional and shallow even in the poor execution of its hasty bookending that depicts Rachel teaching in a kibbutz and visited by one of her collaborator girlfriends in 1956 at two moments that hover ambiguously between a romanticized image of idyllic settlers and a final shot, evidently signaling the Suez crisis, when the kibbutz is seen surrounded by guard towers like a prison yard. Yes, as one viewer said, 'the story never sags.' But the thinking never rises to an adult level.",7,6,11,15 April 2007
Pirate Radio," All things great and small as Brit rockers rock on, and the Establishment be damned
","In the mid-Sixties English rock ruled the world. But strangely, it was almost completely banned from mainstream English radio: the BBC only allowed it to be broadcast two hours a week. To fill the gap, a group of rakish misfits manned an offshore station on a boat just outside UK territorial waters to broadcast rock music day and night, and 25 million Brits stayed tuned. This movie about that effort, so essential to the cultural life of the sceptered isle, is punctuated with vignettes of listeners, which contribute mightily to the period flavor. Another undertone obligato is of slimy Government meanies plotting the mighty little station's destruction. Radio Rock wasn't doing anything technically illegal, but the English government appointed a humorless secretary, who in turn delegated an eager younger spoilsport with the unsubtle joke name Twatt (Jack Davenport), to find a way to shut down the enterprise.Note: this station and the others that followed suit was not an eleemosynary or revolutionary deal but a money-making operation. The broadcast rockers needed to please their sponsors as well as their listeners, and the style was more crude than artsy. As the story's told here, the Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is the only American disk jockey on board, but he's the most passionate about the music, and in a memorable speech he declares that they've been living the best time of their lives and if they go down, it'll have been worth it.This little movie, whose original title is The Boat That Rocked, tells a story of the station's life, its heart, and its struggle to stay afloat that's more anecdotal than historical. This is an old-fashioned English ensemble piece top-heavy with colorful, eccentric characters. It unfolds as a series of cute, risqué tales focusing alternately on different members of the radio crew, all male, save one lesbian lady, and mostly horny. Richard Curtis directed the highly successful Hugh Grant vehicle Love, Actually as well as Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill. He turns from romance to sexual innuendo here, and from hit-making to something more personal and quirky. . With the help of an appealing cast that includes Bill Nighy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rhys Ifans, Nick Frost, Kenneth Branagh, and Tom Sturridge, he keeps the action at all times at least mildly amusing, rounding things out with a rousing finale in which total disaster is narrowly averted. None of the stories seems very urgent -- not even of how a bird dumps her groom after 17 hours for the main British disk jockey (Hoffman is his chief rival), or how Young Carl (Sturridge) loses his virginity and finds his lost dad and then saves him from descending forever into the briny deep carrying a big wooden box of bad rock albums. But as the Government efforts to sink the boat become literal, the movie's energy level rises exponentially. If that isn't sufficient to arouse interest, the song-rich sound track and the end-credit collage, with its panoply of classic vinyl album covers, is enough to send aging rockers out into the lobby tearful, nostalgic, and happy.The emphasis is decidedly upon the sexual in this nearly all-male gathering. Carl has been sent into the care of his godfather Quentin (Nighy) after being expelled from a posh school. The project then becomes to rid him of his virginity but that is sidetracked by sex-starved older competitors as well as his own excessive public school sense of fair play. Carl's efforts are thwarted by Shawn of the Dead's Nick Frost, as a DJ whose corpulence doesn't impede his ability to seduce women. Another major episode is of the chap who marries a girl, only to learn she's shacking up with the station's most famous and rakish announcer, DJ Gavin (Ifans), a sleek, shades-wearing seducer type, who makes salacious love to the microphone and every woman in the audience (and we see them salivate and swoon). Gavin's dramatic and much-publicized return to the station after a hiatus pushes down the Count a peg or two in the station's pecking order.The intramural rivalries become moot as the effort of the government bigwig Sir Alistair Dormandy (Branagh) is stepped up. I cannot reveal details of the finale, but it's tumultuous and, for a small movie, impressively choreographed as well as touching. Pirate Radio is a movie that meanders toward the inconsequential, and then redeems itself with a sense of nothing less than the power of music to unite souls and transform consciousness, during the one period in memory when such unity and transformation was certifiably happening on a wide scale in the English-speaking world. So if this is very far from a great movie, it's still a movie one can have a little corner of affection forg-- and Ifans' salacious announcer is one irresistibly sleazy attention-getter, Hoffman as always a strong presence, and Sturridge clearly soon to be a major new hottie. In addition to the actors mentioned already, the field is deepened by the appearance of Chris O'Dowd, January Jones and a superficially disguised Emma Thompson, who plays Carl's mother. But for those who find the characters hard to keep track of, perhaps the real star of the show is the seventy-odd rock classics that enliven the sound track.",8,2,3,3 January 2010
"I Love You, Man"," Another Apatow episode about growing up--sort of
","Since the Apatow comedies are all about male bonding, it makes sense to have a movie that approaches that topic head on. That's what 'I Love You, Man' is. And as the bonding couple, who better than Mr. Cuddly, Paul Rudd, and Mr. Big Sweet Neurotic Baby, Jasen Segel (who happen to have clicked together since a few years ago, and work so smoothly their hardest acting job was not to seem like old friends from the first scene) . Apatow and some of the key members of his creative team come out of TV and it's best to see the feature films as like extended TV series episodes. This is a good one, but it's still more an episode than a feature film. Why? Because you can best appreciate it if you know all the other films and TV that fed into it.'Apatow' is a rule of thumb term: different writers and directors are involved, but Judd produced '40 Year Old Virgin,' 'Knocked Up,' 'Superbad,' 'Walk Hard,' 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' and 'Pineapple Express.' (I forgot 'Drillbit Taylor'; it might be best to do so.) It's funny, the fertile ground all these popular movies seems to come from is two TV series that basically flopped, or at least they were canceled after 17 or 18 episodes: 'Freaks and Geeks' and 'Undeclared.' Viewers of these will know Jason Segel as an embarrassingly obsessive boyfriend; and then he got practically a whole movie to himself in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' as a boyfriend who can't--forget his girlfriend, that is.I don't really think any of these movies are better than 'Freaks and Geeks' or 'Undelcared,' which were about high-schoolers and first-year college kids, respectively. Both are rich in turn-of-the-21st-century pop cultural implication because they're episodic ensemble pieces, as TV can be. A movie must highlight a few characters for a longer time, and the attention can be tough on the Apatow stable's style, and weaken the prevailing focus on types and generational behavior. Obviously the advantage accrued to the Apatow outlook in full length feature films like '40 Year Old Virgin' and 'Superbad' is the chance for more public, big-screen vulgarity and sexual explicitness. It gave them a chance to express what it is for boys to be boys and embrace the culture's greater willingness to talk dirty, like the guys in Kevin Smith's movies.Like Seth Rogen, who even as a youngster in the making of 'Freaks,' contributed to episodes, and more to 'Undecared' and most to 'Superbad,' Jason also writes. He contributed music to 'Freaks and Geeks' and his own character in the series, Nick Andopolis, must owe much to his own conception; it flows into his 'Sarah Marshall' character, and he wrote 'Sarah Marshall.' In 'I Love You, Man,' Jason's character, Sydney Fife, isn't wildly neurotic, stalking his girlfriend and about to burst into tears (or song) at the drop of a hat, as before. This time, he's more cool. He's super cool, for Peter Kleven, Paul Rudd's character, because he's available for 'bromance,' defined in The Urban Dictionary as 'the complicated love and affection shared by two straight males.' Peter's getting married, it's time to find a best man and he realizes he has dated women and not spent much time with guys. He has no real male friends. At others' suggestion, he starts looking for them. For a while the movie provides vignettes of bad 'man dates,' including one where the date is gay, and kisses Peter. In this Peter's counseled by his almost ridiculously confident and macho gay brother, Robbie (Andy Samberg). The Apatow guys are ready to be gay-friendly, and the issue has to come up here, when men are going to love each other, but they're not ready to take any chances. To secure Robbie's straight-friendliness, his macho dad (the solidly male J.K. Simmons) even declares Robbie's his 'best friend.' Peter sells real estate and while doing an open house for a Lou Ferrigno mansion (don't ask) Sydney appears, and the bonding begins. Sydney is available because he doesn't have a girlfriend. He's just a grown up boy, with his dog whose poop he doesn't clean up, his slob clothes, and his man cell with its masturbation chair. He's a guy-guy, but he can talk about stuff. He's direct and honest and demands that of Peter, which Peter finds attractive. So, they bond. Ostensibly Peter was just looking for a best man. But he finds out he's open to the rewards and challenges of bromance. Trouble is, his fiancée inevitably finds this a bit invasive. Man love takes time away from man-woman love.Trouble comes when Sydney gives a toast at a pre-wedding family dinner where he's a bit too explicit in revealing his knowledge about a shortcoming in the sex between Peter and his fiancée, Zooey (Rashida Jones).Actually the best parts of 'I Love You, Man,' are where Peter struggles for a language of camaraderie when talking to Sydney, turning out silly abbreviations and nicknames for his new pal. Rudd manages to be both unguarded and smooth. Rudd hasn't always played such an adorable character as he does here. In truth I don't know where Paul Rudd came from (TV, somewhere), but he is universally beloved. Rudd's a nice-looking, sweet guy, sweet almost to the point of sappiness. But he can also be mean and manic: see his anti-Starbucks rant on YouTube. I can imagine him playing Neil LaBute.'I Love You, Man' is more like a chick flick than they've done before--but a chick flick where the guys do the chick thing of sharing secrets and emotions. This being the case, it's a bit (but only a bit) less vulgar and sophomoric than other comedies in the series, and the language is toned down. But it still works and it's fun. Segal and Rudd work so well together you may not realize how much fun till later.",8,6,14,21 March 2009
Superbad," Revenge of the nerds: the next generation
","The starting point of this movie is a theme that's come up before--it's basic to Brian Robbins' silly and stupid but entertaining 'The Perfect Score' (2004): two best friends in high school are going to be separated because one got into a good college and the other didn't. As summer approaches a couple of the cool 'in' girls ask them to supply the liquor for a party and they think they have one last chance to lose their virginity before they go away. The friends are the bushy-haired and overweight Seth (Jonah Hill) and the taller, lean, silky voiced Evan (Michael Cera). They talk dirty, but they don't know what they're talking about. Mottola's low keyed road comedy 'Daytrippers' appeared nine years ago and he's since been working in TV. He's now joined the team of Judd Apatow, who produced the very popular '40-Year-Old Virgin' and the current big summer hit 'Knocked Up.' 'Superbad' partly grows out of the late nineties TV series Judd Apatow produced, 'Freaks and Geeks,' of which Seth Rogen, star of 'Knocked Up' (and a cast member here), was an important part, as writer as well as actor. 'Superbad' is the brainchild of Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who conceived it together when they were in their early teens in Vancouver.'Freaks and Geeks' focused on a high school world where nothing was ever fair, where outcast status linked stoners and bad students and smart kids who weren't social -- as symbolized by the almost-romance between dumb dreamboat Daniel (James Franco) and the sensitive outcast and mathlete Lindsey (Linda Cardellini). 'Perfect' guys and girls are who we'd like to identify with, and that's why big stars are so often gorgeous. But they aren't who we really are: 'perfect' people aren't real.. In movies geeks and nerds usually aren't real either; they're stereotypes. But 'Superbad' gets away from that. Seth and Evan are a source of comedy, but they aren't unreal. They're just not aggressive like the campus macho men -- the types who're always beating up on undersized Sam (John Francis Daly), Lindsey's little brother in 'Freaks and Geeks,' and who spit on Seth and warn him not to come to the cool girls' party. Seth and Evan do plan on going to the party anyway, helped by their nerdy pal Fogell (hilarious newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who's just acquired a fake ID that says he's a 25-year-old organ donor from Hawaii named simply McLovin (no first name). Fogell's going to buy alcohol. The babes (AKA 'ladies,' using the Player name) are going to get sloshed and get laid by mistake, and as Seth says, 'We could be that mistake.' Fogell gets clobbered at the liquor store by a holdup man, then taken in tow by two very wayward and unserious cops. Seth and Evan get mixed up with a dodgy guy who takes them to a more dangerous party. The way to the cool girls' party is as convoluted as Harry and Kumar's trip to White Castle. 'Superbad' isn't necessarily funnier than earlier teen or college comedies, the 'Harry and Kumars' and 'Dude Where's My Cars,' but it has a humanistic arc they lack. Like 'Knocked Up,' it leads off with a stream of foul language and winds up with sweetness and doing the right thing. It excels in celebrating the male friendships. It dares to speak of male love and depict it as something abandoned on the way to growing up, like Seth's drawings of penises--which he confesses to Ethan to having done obsessively as a little boy and which are shown in a phantasmagoric panorama in the middle and in the closing credits. The joke of these virgins locked in male-male bonding is that they can't deal with a babe when she throws herself at them. In a world of 40-year-old virgins it's no surprise Michael Cera was recruited from a TV series called 'Arrested Development.' Apatow says Seth Rogan really lives like the character he plays in 'Knocked Up.' In its blend of dirty talk and sweetness Apatow's and his posse's comedies are something different for which the current audience is more than ready, and his productions are beginning to multiply like prairie fires. It's great the way Apatow keeps gathering contributors and remaining faithful to them, and lets actors improvise freely. This is likely to wind up being not just a body of work, but a new school of American screen comedy, not unlike earlier productions of the kind but more fertile, almost a rival to the Eighties youth movies. And this success is deserved. There's a movement and energy in 'Virgin,' 'Knocked Up,' and 'Superbad' that shows the team know what they're doing. It's not all perfection, however. 'Knocked Up' seems like wishful thinking on several levels, with the smart girl accepting the nerd; and why is abortion completely skipped over as an option?. The physical business in 'Superbad' is crude, and not really that funny; the cop sequence is pointless and false--it too, wishful thinking..There is nothing sinister or revolutionary about the guys' language. It is a great exaggeration to think Seth & co. are so much more sophisticated or deviant in their sexual lore than earlier generations: society has just granted them license to use in public the bluntest language about what they, like their predecessors, still barely understand. But the language, post-Kevin Smith as it is, is a great source of relieved laughter. Something that was always there is now okay to speak about -- like two straight guys who love each other.NOTES: I got some of my information about Apatow & Co. from Damon Wise's piece 'Crowning around' in 'The Guardian,' August 11, 2007. 'Superbad,' by the way, has a terrific opening title with silhouettes of Evan and Seth dancing.",8,3,10,19 August 2007
Terminator Salvation," It's dark and gloomy without Arnold
","It's 25 years since the original 'Terminator,' starring Arnold Schwartzenegger and written and directed by James Cameron, but our memories aren't too dim to recall how much silly loud fun that movie was, in comparison. Arnold and James also teamed up for the slightly less successful but still breathtakingly exciting 'Terminator 2.' Cameron left Arnold to his own devices (or rather another director) for the still less successful, but nonetheless highly profitable and arguably quite entertaining 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,' which heralds the situation chronicled in this still louder and more high tech and more fatalistic 'Terminator' blockbuster, which has had just about all the fun squeezed out of it. What a pity Arnold was too busy struggling with California's hopeless state budget to lend his endearingly wooden charm and outsize body to this movie. The first thing that's wrong with this version is that the machines have no personalities, not even an Austrian weightlifter's.We have to begin with a sci-fi plot device I can never quite understand: that the hero must enter the past to change things so the future--that is, the present--can turn out the way it is already. Or at least that's how it seems to me. I just find it hard enough living in the present. If anybody can go back and tinker with history, like Dick Cheney, at just about any time, what's the use? But this is the essence of the 'Terminator' franchise: delving back into the past to change things so your side, be it humanity or the evil cyber world, will have an edge.Throughout the series, humankind has been enslaved by machines. (Now that part I get.) A man named John Connor leads a revolt of the human slaves. How do we know that, if it's changeable? There's always that struggle from one film to the next over going back in time to prevent Connor from being born, or kill him off as a kid, or make sure he is born. This could go on forever; but then franchises are designed that way.What's equally mystifying in this cool-looking, stylistically distinctive, but relatively more pointless 'Terminator' film, the fourth in the franchise, is that this appears to be at least partly a prequel (maybe any time-travel story is?), but it's also thoroughly post-apocalyptic. The world, which just to keep things convenient let us call Los Angeles, is now a post-nuclear holocaust wasteland of broken metal and minefields. John Connor is Christian Bale. But--and this is another thing I can't quite follow--his dad, Kyle Reese, is among the prisoners, in the youthful form of Anton Yelchin, no longer spouting a Russian accent as in the new 'Star Trek'. And of course Anton has to be protected because the machines are out to kill him, because. . .well, if we know the series, we know why. Couldn't they just kill Christian Bale? Well, they'd like to, but they simply can't, because, well, he's Batman, you know, and he's a real s.o.b. as well.The ghost in the machine, so to speak (the machine of this rather mechanical sequel) is Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a prisoner on death row in the film prelude who signs his body over to Helena Bonham Carter for 'research.' Somehow he pops up fifteen years later, very confused about what he is. A pity the muscular Worthington is rather bland, because he plays a pivotal role either as nemesis or salvation, it's not certain which.A cyborg gives his heart that Christian Bale may live, which seems rather appropriate given the apparently dysfunctional Bale's rude manners both on screen and off. Bale is relentlessly one-note as the leader in battle against the man-killer machines, and the anticlimactic ending states that the war remains yet to be won. All that's been accomplished is a lot of explosions (set off nicely by the dark, monochromatic visuals) and a lot of ornately bent-up metal, somewhere in what is referred to as Los Angeles. Let's hear it for the explosions (as well as the fires, the detonators, the electro-shocks, the crashes, the monstrous death's-head creatures, and the computer-readout thingies, for this is their film, and they light it up both literally and figuratively against the prevailingly dark and ashen landscape). Nothing else much matters, other than a brief and shining moment when what looks like a naked Arnold does battle with Christian Bale. In the other 'Terminator' movies, especially the first two, there was a lot more human interest. Even the machines were (almost) human, and that made all the difference. All the noise and violence are very well done, but they're not as pretty as 'Star Trek's.' Space makes an even nicer background for a big explosion than a nuclear wasteland.",6,1,5,22 May 2009
Insomnia," I stayed awake for this one.
","It's fun to watch Al Pacino and Robin Williams working together in this noirish police procedural with a twist, especially fun to see Robin Williams, as a sicko loner, still holding the screen just as well without his usual manic good cheer. Williams' performance is eerie because it's low-keyed and free of mannerisms. If you're a big Pacino fan, which I guess I am, you won't mind seeing so very, very much of those big soulful eyes in that droopy sallow face, and hearing the soft, damaged-sounding Pacino voice droning on in his performance as Will Dormer, an L.A. robbery/homicide detective working in exile in Alaska while Internal Affairs investigates him back home and his partner threatens to cut a deal with I.A. to save his own skin.  Even muttering on the edge of sleep, Pacino always gives his lines an interesting, intelligent reading.  This is a bigger, darker, more complicated, no doubt much more expensive version of the original Norwegian `Insomnia' of five years ago which starred Stellan Skarsgård. It must cost a lot to hire two Oscar winners like Williams and Pacino in the same movie. There's an excellent supporting cast including another Oscar winner, Hillary Swank, who has a whole lot less to do playing a diligent young rookie detective than she did in her extraordinary performance as Brandon Teena in `Boys Don't Cry,' and who sinks to the role pretty well, but offers her admirers little to chew on. Nicky Katt adds some alertness as a young cop, and Paul Dooley adds some mellowness as an old one. Christopher Nolan has done an interesting job in this adaptation and hasn't `sold out' by having a big budget. He may be getting better; he's certainly no worse. `Memento' seemed thrillingly provocative at the time, and Guy Pierce's lean edginess was perfect, but on re-viewing that movie's gimmick wears thin. The hero who can't make new memories is a freak, and we can't identify with him.Nolan's moody, dark ambiance in `Insomnia' continually draws you in, but causes some confusion.  One of the story's basic points is that we're in a place where the sun shines 22 hours a day and that makes the troubled detective's insomnia total.  The imagery in the original Norwegian `Insomnia' was, logically, mercilessly bright. This version is only bright when the dialogue insists on it. The scene where Will piles things up to block his hotel window doesn't make sense and the hotel keeper comes in and flips on the light to prove it. `What's wrong?' she asks.  `This room's too light,' Will says.  `No, it's dark,' she answers, and she's right.  Did the cinematographer pay attention to the original story? Every indoor shot is gloomy and mysterious.  There are never shadows on Robin Williams' face as you'd think there would be with constant sunlight.  There are, however, sudden blasts of violent, jarring sights and sounds, and Christopher Nolan hasn't entirely sworn off his sudden scary flash cuts. This is partly a psychological thriller, but the new version is more of an action movie. Nolan's blasts are louder (and so is the music of David Julyan, who worked with Nolan on `Memento' and `Following.').  I'm not sure the filmmakers got clear on what their style and mood were going to be. The Norwegian version was full of action too, but felt smaller, as it was. It wasn't as involving as this version, but it was more consistent.Pacino isn't manic the way Skarsgård was; he's terribly world-weary and always seems just about to doze off - except that he can't.  Robin Williams has been given an interesting, and far expanded, role as the hack mystery writer and creepy recluse, who tries to collaborate, in this version, with the morally compromised cop to escape detection for his own crime.  This is a very 'Forties, noirish idea and I'd like to have seen more of it and less of the police procedural shenanigans and less bother about Internal Affairs. The writers on this new `Insomnia' don't grasp that when you add new things, some of the old stuff becomes unnecessary.  In adding so much in, Nolan has successfully appealed to a broad audience and kept the story very attention-getting, but he has also made it feel more conventional. Jonathan Jackson, as the girl victim's bad boy beau Randy Stetson, is far too pretty and soigné, a fugitive from Beverly Hills, not Nightmute, Alaska.  Even Hillary Swank, a striking woman, was less pretty as a boy than Jonathan.",Null,0,0,15 June 2002
500 Days of Summer," Rom-com with a twist is really conventional -- but still sweet
","(500) Days of Summer is a romantic comedy with a new approach. What is original is not the indie mannerisms of this Sundance hit -- the references to groups like The Smiths, the meet-cute at a greeting card company, the tendentious voice-over, or the jumbled chronology, but the fact that the couple doesn't live happily ever after. This is the story of a love affair that goes south. It's made clear right off the bat that the wooing of Summer (Zooey Deschanel) by Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) led to disappointment for Tom. With its downbeat story arc and only mildly hopeful finale, Days defeats genre expectations. But it still works within a highly conventional framework.And so you'd better like the stars. The faces of Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel dominate the screen. Indeed they seem a cute and well-matched couple, the reedy, deep-voiced Gordon-Levitt, with his buttoned-down appearance and mobile face, and the winsome, wide-eyed Deschanel. Gordon-Levitt has the more interesting and challenging role. He runs a gamut of emotions, beginning interested and doubtful when Summer becomes the boss's assistant at the greeting card company where he works; then growing hopeful, falling in love, walking on air (even doing a song and dance number with a movie-musical chorus line) after they finally have sex, playful and delighted; then despairing, hopes dashed, numbed, drunken; and briefly hopeful again after a separation when Summer walks away from Tom and her job, and they meet once more on the way to a wedding, she invites him to a party, and he thinks they'll get back together. Gordon-Leavitt is good: he's always working, and it never shows.Deschanel is less interesting to observe. Her character is bland and elusive. Summer seems to alternate only between giving in and pushing away. It's hard not to think, if you're a man, that Summer's a terrible tease; that she breaks Tom's heart without a qualm. Didn't she say she just wanted to be friends? Yes, she did. So from the female viewpoint, Tom is pushy and adolescent. He doesn't listen. But then why does Summer engage with Tom in experimental shower sex and humorously play house with him at Ikea? He's a romantic who believes in destiny. The twist is that Summer is converted to a belief in these things by finding a man, but that man is not Tom. Meanwhile the failure of his romance with Summer has shattered Tom's romantic illusions. One good thing comes out of it for him: he can't write cheery jingles anymore and goes back to pursuing a career as an architect.Deschenel has had many roles in films, but they linger mostly on notes that are winsome and fey; she's the Hollywood quirky deadpan girl (notable efforts are All the Real Girls, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy , and Tin Man). Gordon-Leavitt, on the other hand, has shown daring and skill in the range of roles he's played in Manic (a violent, disturbed youth), The Lookout (a brain-damaged sports hero who turns to crime), Latter Days (a homophobic Mormon) Mysterous Skin (a gay hustler), Brick (a high school detective), and Stop-Loss (a gung-ho young soldier). He's been good in all of these and they've been interesting films. The conventionality of this relatively mainstream rom-com role in (500) Days of Summer is, paradoxically, a new challenge for him. Deschanel, who definitely had a fresh appeal when she started out, has chosen some notably dubious films to be in, such as Elf, Failure to Launch, Yes Man, and The Happening. Though fans of Deschanel say this is one of her best parts, both the actress and the writing of her character weaken the film. Snapshots of previous lovers aside, Summer has no background, her job is undefined, and we don't get to know her friends. The cute but recessive Deschanel doesn't emerge as a clearcut personality.Despite the twist of the negative ending, the more you think about (500) Days of Summer the more conventional it seems. Its worst element is its gratingly insistent shifts back and forth in time over the famous 500 days, signaled by an on screen clicker whose specificity (day 442, day 3, day 157, whatever) doesn't keep it from being ultimately numbing and confusing. If you can keep all these numbers in your head, good for you; but the shuffling seems anything but enlightening. Sure, it's meant to convey the mosaic of feelings a tangled relationship leaves behind in he memory of the victim. But it's also a needless distraction, a 'modernist' device to keep the audience busy but a sign the filmmakers neglected the harder job of crafting a coherent narrative. A reversed or jumbled chronology is a cliché by now. The only enlightenment we get from this one is a sense of the obvious: that sometimes things were going well between Tom and Summer, and sometimes they weren't. And that Summer always saw things differently from Tom, because he fell in love and she knew all along he wasn't the one.Something utterly routine is the pair of buddies who'd like to advise Tom but can't because the nerdy McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) is a perpetual loser with the ladies and the chiseled-cheeked Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) has been with the same girl since elementary school. The only difference from convention is that they aren't comical or tricksters as in films like 40 Days and 40 Nights or Knocked Up.But while the latter two movies may be more fun, (500) Days of Summer, despite my reservations, is enjoyable viewing because of the cute couple that charms you and the heartbreak that touches you. Cuteness and charm and heartbreak, if you don't intrude on them too much, go a long way, and even the convoluted time-scheme can't obliterate them. But if Marc Webb and writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber sought to reinvent the wheel, they still came up with the familiar round utensil.",8,0,2,19 July 2009
Juno," A real smart girl comedy
","Like The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Superbad, Juno is partly an offshoot of the now increasingly seminal-seeming TV series 'Freaks and Geeks,' with a loosely unified point of view, with certain actors recurring, and above all with Judd Apatow as presiding Master of the Revels. That this is, overall, a fortunate turn of affairs for American film comedy has never been more obvious than in the charming and revelatory new film about a teenage girl, Juno.Juno is a sixteen-year-old in high school who gets pregnant. She's an extension of Linda Cardellini's 'Freaks' character, Lindsay. She's not quite a Freak or a Geek, but she refuses to conform and she's provocative, articulate, and aware she doesn't know who she is yet. In her every burst of repartee Juno's striving to define herself, stay honest and sane, and not take any crap off anybody. The important thing is the character more than the issue, though it's the measure of the fluidity and smarts of the writing that you can't really separate the two.Though his character Paulie is marvelously understated, Michael Cera, the tall young Canadian who's also one of the principals of Superbad, also defines the frame of reference a little differently from previous comedies. He's Juno's boyfriend--or her non-boyfriend, because that's still undecided too, and he's the father of her child. He's not a bad guy nor is he capable of making things alright. He's just a kid, like her. But he's sweet and decent. Juno tells him he behaves well and makes it look easy. But he says actually he works really hard at it.After an icky visit to an abortion clinic and a chat with an Asian classmate picketing it, Juno and her girlfriend Lea (Olivia Thirby) decide she's going to have the baby and they find a yuppie couple seeking adoption in a local free paper. When Juno visits Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) they're yuppies living in a McMansion, but they're sincere. Right away Juno bonds alarmingly with Mark, because he's a musician, even if he's sold out, writing for commercials.We can't tell how this all pans out because Juno is first of all a journey with surprising bumps along the way, but aside from the very funny, very smart writing throughout by Diablo Cody (that's a lady) and the fact that Ellen Page's sharp tongue is sweetened by the fact that she's completely adorable, this movie is rounded out by alternative points of view. Juno's dad (a very strong J.K. Simmons) is wholly supporting, but she has a stepmother ('The West Wing's' Allison Janney) whose remarks are tinged with acid. Most importantly for a good while in the middle Vanessa and Mark draw the viewer's attention. How are they handling all this? What does it mean to have to adopt? What strains is their marriage under? The movie takes a good look at them before going back to Juno.'Freaks and Geeks' ends with members of the two groups hanging out together. To begin with Lindsay was a bit of both. If she hung out with the Freaks, her younger brother Sam, the number two character, was 100% Geek. Paulie is a kind of geek: he does extremely well in school. But he's also a jock, perpetually seen in running togs or with the cross country team. The essence of the 'Freaks and Geeks' point of view is that though categorizing in youth is a relentless social process, categories are essentially limiting and false.Juno comes across as smarter and less lame than Knocked Up. It's not a fat Jewish boy's fantasy of being accepted by a cute girl. It's ending is a bit of a cop-out, but essentially what matters is the way the prevailing voice encompasses young attitudes and realities As in the Apatow comedies the message remains that it's hip and okay to be a good person. But since this is a collective kind of comedy that's been emerging, there's no one truth and some of the scenes and ideas in Juno too are lame while some others are exceptionally humorous and witty.These new comedies are cool: they devise a loose system where it's hard to go wrong, and Juno goes particularly right. This is the real woman's version of Knocked Up: that's why the title is the name of the girl. Juno remains Junoeven 'knocked up.' This is the essential point. How Mark and Vanessa turn out is left hanging. The ending feels a little bit incomplete. Partly this is TV series thinking, where it's assumed there's always another episode coming along later to tie up loose ends. It's in the classic nature of comedy to embrace people and reconcile us to things. Juno like the best new American comedies provides a framework to see contemporary reality and embrace it. Director Jason Reitman, whose first film, Thank You for Smoking, was more satirical and political, has come into the fold.When Juno's had her baby, she and Paulie go back to playing in a band together. In high school, it's a lot better when music is the most important thing, not having babies. Yes, this is 'feel-good' stuff, but it's smart, even if its sitcom-casual structure has some holes in it. Maybe Apatow has peaked as a comedy impresario with this one. Word is out that he takes a dive with Walk Hard.",9,6,17,19 December 2007
Match Point," Game, set, match: Woody scores a big one
","'Match Point' is elegant and peculiar. There are some classic conventions that are followed, but followed in Woody Allen's own ways. It has three main elements: social climbing, adultery, and crime, all in a posh English setting that plays two arrivistes, an American girl, a would-be actress, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) and an Irish boy, fading (but still young) tennis star Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) against a rich London family, the Hewitts. When everything falls into the boy's lap -- wealth, position, a doting wife-- and against the odds he is immediately adored by the family patriarch, Alec Hewett (Brian Cox), Chris is nonetheless compelled from first opportunity to pursue the American girl. To begin with she is taboo because she's his brother-in-law to be Tom Hewett's fiancée; then she is taboo because Tom has let her go and she is effectively banished from the family, which has accepted Chris as the partner for Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chris's relationship with Nola stands to ruin everything, yet he can't resist it.Allen follows conventions that are expedient rather than realistic. It all happens so quickly: Chris is hired as tennis pro at a fashionable club. After a lesson from him, the tall, patrician Tom Hewitt invites Chris to the family box at the opera. He is immediately admired by Chloe, and they begin going out together. Alec likes Chris, and approves him for Chloe, so he's given a good post at one of Alec's firms. He's soon offered a chance at, and gets, a very high position at the firm with perks, car, and driver. He and Chloe take an enormous flat overlooking the Thames paid for by Alec.When this rapid rise is barely beginning Chris meets Nola because she's with Tom. Johannson and Rhys-Meyers are given screen-devouring closeups as in a private moment Chris comes on strong to Nola. Her warnings and demurrals only whet his appetite. As the story is smoothly and rapidly filled in, nothing really matters for the movie's progress so long as Chloe is doting, Alec nurturing, Tom debonair, and the family spreads splendid. The important thing is that Rhys-Meyers and Johannson be strong and intense, that their personalities seem vivid and their chemistry convincing. It works. The two actors have the same mocking intensity; they even have the same lips. They're attractive misfits, perfectly cast. You can believe they'd be drawn tightly together. These two people aren't dolls in a Woody Allen movie. They're alive.Rhys-Meyers, who has played wicked or androgynous roles (but also the decent coach in 'Bend It Like Beckham' and George Osborne in 'Vanity Fair'), gets to be here something more like what perhaps he originally was in life: an ambitious young man of talent from a poor Irish family. Johansson, who has a bold, ironic presence, is fine in the early scenes when she is simply saying no in a way that can only inflame an eager young man, and then acquiescing with growing passion in the forbidden affair. The scenes between the two may not be the world's hottest but they sparkle. It's only later when Johansson has to be more and more needy and doting that she turns shrill and ordinary. But by that time the plot has wound so tight it may not matter.Chris marries Chloe. Tom also marries someone more approved by his mother (same cleric, church, and shot). Chloe wants children from Chris as soon as possible, but she can't get pregnant. This effort becomes increasingly tedious and mechanical for Chris as his sexual affair heats up with Nola, newly returned to London from a spell in America after the break with Tom and many failed auditions. Though she's brazen and sassy with Chris, she wilts when she tries out for a part. It's a classic film convention that every setting is beyond nice, and so somehow Nola on return has found a terrific flat though in a rather dicey neighborhood. This is as far as we can go except to say that the final sequences include not only references to Greek tragedy but Hitchcockian cross-cutting to create suspense, and a police procedural segment that moves rapidly. Yes, there have been repeated references to the role of chance in life and somebody does read 'Crime and Punishment.' The ending makes Chris not a little like Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley, but also has links with Dreiser. Come to think of it, the whole setup suggests Henry James. The look of the scenes is bright and beautiful. The use of Caruso arias as background music works remarkably well, and idiosyncratically, to suggest illicit ('operatic') passion, and toward the end, to provide a sense of near-hysterical tension.'Match Point' isn't without flaws. Ms. Johannson's unfortunate shrillness toward the end has been mentioned. Besides that, the early section is flatly expository. We can see the wheels turning, even if they're well oiled. The middle section, whose adultery becomes a bit too sweaty for this glamorous exercise in nihilism, is more tiring than farcical. The last part is thrilling, but almost seems spliced on from another more suspenseful movie. Nonetheless because of lively acting and swift pacing it all works, and works surprisingly well. Though it may be taken as serious -- Match Point is hardly a comedy -- this new Woody Allen movie, despite plot similarities to some earlier Allen oeuvres, notably Crimes and Misdemeanors, indeed is a bright new departure after a long spell of tedium from the Manhattan auteur. It may be thought-provoking, but before anything else it's engaging, exciting, and fun. One of the year's best American films.",10,0,2,7 January 2006
Zodiac," A dogged, frustrating film but a new approach for Fincher
","David Fincher's Zodiac, like Billy Ray's Breach, approaches what's normally a sensational theme (finding a murderer; catching a spy) in a flat and realistic way. The critics prefer Zodiac; the public prefers Breach. Breach has a payoff. The spy gets caught, even if the process of getting him is more sweaty than flashy. Zodiac exhaustively explores a serial killer case that was never solved. Zodiac lacks any of the fulfillment of traditional drama and storytelling. Zodiac gives us police procedure, rather than a 'police procedural.' Therein lies Zodiac's strength. The case is exciting, lurid, but without a payoff. The pleasure of chasing clues for their own sake has never been shown in a movie. The excitement of such a story usually derives from a progression that here never happens.As Walter Chaw puts it, 'Zodiac deals in millennial anxieties: the un-'catchable' foe; the unknowable cipher; the futility of the best efforts of good and smart men.' In his admiring Village Voice review, Nathan Lee says, 'The result is an orgy of empiricism, a monumental geek fest of fact-checking, speculation, deduction, code breaking, note taking, forensics, graphology, fingerprint analysis, warrant wrangling, witness testimony, phone calls, news reports. 'I felt like I was stuck in a filing cabinet for three hours,' complained one viewer. Exactly!' For Lee, that was intriguing and radical. For me it was simply demoralizing. Zodiac is, after all, a movie. And with its able cinematographer Harris Savides and its cast of well known actors, it declares itself to be a movie at every turn, despite its scrupulous adherence to the known.As Zodiac makes its way through its excruciating two and a half hours, the attention gradually, and necessarily, shifts from the elusive killer to a straight arrow named Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a newspaper cartoonist and former Eagle Scout whose obsession with the case is marginally intense enough to keep us going. At least it keeps him going. While traditional crime movies focus on cases that get solved, the payoff this time is that Graysmith writes a book. And his book is the main source of this film, whose screenplay he coauthored. What's Graysmith doing now? Nathan Lee tells us: he's writing a book called Shooting Zodiac, about the production of this film.This is a change for Fincher. His career high points are the flashy, cultish Se7en and Fight Club, with the less stellar The Game and Panic Room in between. Se7en, like Zodiac, concerns a serial killer, but the earlier film is shocking, thrilling, horrifying. Even though Zodiac shows gruesome killings and attempted killings, they feel ugly rather than exciting. They're necessary to understand what the staff of the San Francisco Chronicle (where Graysmith worked as a cartoonist at the time) and various law enforcement agencies are worked up about.The self-identified Zodiac killer kept Californians terrorized for ten months of 1968 and 1969. There were seven verified victims, of whom two survived. The Zodiac stayed in the news by writing taunting letters and cryptograms to the newspapers up until 1974. He spoke of man as the most dangerous prey of all and killing people as fun. He made many threats -- including a promise to kill all the kids on a school bus. He claimed many other victims, but none was verified. There were many suspects, only one seriously investigated, Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch), who's repeatedly questioned and searched. There was much circumstantial evidence against him but no physical evidence, and the police decided not to press charges. The file was closed, then reopened in 2004. No one was ever caught. The FBI, local and state police, and various press people and experts were drawn into the tangled case. Fincher draws on top people to tell this story, which is based largely on screenplay coauthor Graysmith's original book. When eccentric celebrity lawyer Melvin Belli gets drawn into the case, he has Brian Cox to play Belli (Cox is always good, but he's not as fussy or elegant as the real Belli was). When the director needs someone to play a substance-abusing San Francisco Chronicle writer who became identified with the case, he uses Robert Downey Jr, who surely knows this territory. For the straight-arrow Chronicle cartoonist Graysmith it's Jake Gyllenhaal. Because Gyllenhaal is appealing and righteous with a slight edge of excessive intensity, he's well cast. For the thankless role of Graysmith's date, then his wife, whose main importance is that she has to take a secondary role to Zodiac, the sympathetic Chloë Sevigny was called in. For David Toschi, a chief police inspector on the case -- like Avery, Graysmith, and his wife, one of its casualties -- we get Mark Ruffalo (using a light voice that's a little too artificial and attention-catching). For the handwriting expert who retires and turns to drink, Sherwood Morill (another casualty?) Fincher gives us Philip Baker Hall. There are also familiar incidental faces like those of Dermot Mulroney, James Le Gros, Anthony Edwards(as Toschi's parter William Armstrong, and another casualty), Elias Koteas, Clea DuVall, and many others. It's a good cast but maybe a too recognizable one for what purports to be something like vérité. This is without mentioning the darker shadow world of incidental informers and suspects, who while (perhaps fortunately) are less recognizable, seem equally well chosen.Probably because of the Zodiac's taunting letters and the way the case was publicized, he's been a great influence on popular fiction and film and the public mind. Eight movies relate to him, including Dirty Harry, and at least five novels and several graphic novels as well as numerous pop songs. But does this make a great movie? Fincher's epic, in some ways impressive, version is engrossing but ultimately frustrating.",8,1,5,10 March 2007
Milk," Gus Van Sant pays his dues
","'Milk' is another powerful mainstream American movie about gay experience. It seems destined to have the same kind of influence on the public mind as Jonathan Demme's 'Philadelphia' and Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain,' both of which were prominent at Oscar time. Like them this isn't a great film but it's an important one.In 'Milk' the topic widens to gay politics and gay rights. 'These are not 'issues,'' Harvey Milk tells a major opponent, 'these are our lives we're fighting for. ' His own life peaked at a transformative place and time for homosexuals, San Francisco in the 1970's. A San Francisco Supervisor assassinated by the disgruntled conservative Supervisor Dan White in 1978, Milk was the first openly gay man to elected to public office in California. He was a gay activist who gained fame and political clout. 'A homosexual with power--that's scary,' Milk tells Mayor Moscone--an ally with whom he sparred, and who was assassinated with him.If he hadn't been killed early in his political career Milk might have traded his jocular title of 'Mayor of Castro Street' (the city's predominantly gay district) for the formal one of Mayor of San Francisco. Dan White himself predicted this.While Milk sought the whole city's attention with a seemingly trivial cause--a 'pooper scooper' law forcing citizens to clean up after their dogs, he has come to represent a profile in courage--a man willing to face up to Orange County bigots on their own turf, who insisted all gays must come out of the closet to unite in strength. The film doesn't idealize the man; his private life is obviously messy, and despite his preaching, he was in the closet to his own parents. His lover leaves him, and a new Latino boyfriend (Diego Luna) is totally unstable.Every gay advance seems to bring on a backlash. After the 1969 Stonewall Riots (alluded to in news footage as Milk opens) more gay men and lesbians were out and proud, but Anita Bryant, the Florida orange juice advertiser and right-wing Christian gay basher, was on the rampage campaigning for measures all over the country to remove gay rights. In California in 1978 one of her many causes was the Briggs Initiative, Proposition 6, which would have mandated firing all the state's gay teachers.Today, while the election of an African-American as President makes the US look more friendly toward minorities, anti-gay measures are still on ballots in many states at election times. On the same day that Obama was elected, Californian gay people saw the passage of Proposition 8, put over by Mormon money, to outlaw gay marriage in the state.Leaving behind the hermetic, personal wavelength of his best film 'My Own Private Idaho' and the stylized elegance of his recent quartet of films, Van Sant returns to a conventional mode closer to his 'Good Will Hunting' and 'Finding Forrester'--but this time with more scope and more commitment to taking a stand as a gay man with a wide audience. The writer for the film was the former Mormon Justin Lance Black, writer for several gay-related films and the TV series about a polygamist Mormon, 'Big Love.' Harvey Milk (a nicely modulated Sean Penn) first appears recording a tape testament in his final year of life, a scene that bookends the film. Penn's noted for emotionally overwrought roles but his Harvey Milk is someone who rarely loses his cool or his sense of humor even when he meets the hostile Briggs or regularly has to deal with his clueless, inept opponent Dan White (a fine Josh Brolin). Milk mocked the right-wingers' fiction that homosexuals are pedophiles who want to proselytize youth--that gays are made not born--by opening public addresses with, 'My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you.' It's a line often repeated in the film.The movie, as is the way with conventional biopics, paints its subject's life in broad strokes. He meets his young lover Scott Smith (an appealing James Franco) while a corporate drone in New York. They decide to start a new life in San Francisco, and open a camera shop together on Castro Street. Before long Milk is in the thick of political activity, talking to Teamsters and cutting off his beard and pony tail and donning suit and tie to meet the general public.Milk emerges as a true politician. Moscone compares him to Boss Tweed. Through leading a successful boycott of Coors beer for the Teamsters, he forges strong links with labor. Scenes are crowded with political coworkers, and resident cute boys.Most of all the movie is a picture of community organizing and campaign management. This is told in broad stroke too, but there are many historically specific personalities. Milk ran for office many times before redistricting made a clear win possible. Scotty is his manager, till he can't bear another losing campaign and moves out. Next Milk 'recruits' a cocky young runaway and street hustler, Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), who claims he can get a thousand gay men on the street on demand and also boasts 'I don't do losing.' With his new well-connected lesbian campaign manager Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill) he secures endorsements from the Bay Guardian and the Chronicle, and he wins handily.It's unusual for a mainstream film to get so much into the practical details of local politics. At the same time Jack is jealous of Scott and Cleve and moving toward a meltdown, and Dan White, having his own more dangerous meltdown, is waiting in the wings.As a San Franciscan I wish the atmosphere of the tragic finale had been properly amplified by a horrified awareness of the Jim Jones massacre, the news of which had emerged barely a week before White shot Moscone and Milk. But otherwise this stands as an essential piece of gay and California history and Van Sant's fluent, lively film couldn't come at a better time.",9,53,85,30 November 2008
Cloverfield," 'Are you still filming? People will want to know how it all went down'
","'Cloverfield' is an astonishing piece of vérité. Carried to an impossible extreme, as vérité can be sometimes, this movie pretending to be shot with a cheap video camera takes us right into a New York City Armageddon where giant serpents or trolls start out by duplicating the feel of 9/11, only all over midtown, with buildings collapsing or bursting into flames and people rushing around madly in extremis.But it doesn't happen right away, because it's vérité--it really happened, you see--so a guy just happened to have a video camera in his hand while he was at a goodbye party in a downtown loft for a young corporate yuppie man who got a cool assignment to Japan. It's the clever conceit of this movie that a good twenty minutes go by before the Godzilla stuff happens, just long enough so you're actually getting vaguely interested in how it's coming out that something is going on between the party boy Rob( Michael Stahl-David), and his girlfriend Beth (Odette Yustman), or something, and you've relaxed and almost forgotten what you were waiting for to happen, when it does. Wham! And then everything is collapsing and somehow the strong survive all the way down to the bottom of the building--this is where 9/11 really echoes in your mind--and out onto the street, with cars and cops and people every which way and pieces of buildings falling into themselves and lights all red and orange, and the camera always a-tilt and running.because somebody has handed it to Hud (T.J. Miller), Rob's not-too-smart but faithful and determined best buddy, at the start of the party with instructions to record people, which he went around doing, till now. And Beth is up on the West Side, and Rob has the crazy notion that they've got to get up there to save her.This being the post-modern media world, it's all a movie-within-a-movie-within-a movie. We are watching a film retrieved by the government from 'the area formerly known as Central Park' after an 'incident' code-named 'Cloverfield,' so this is the government's archival film now, and every so often it glitches back to an earlier film Rob shot, where he's on a first date on Coney Island falling in love with Beth. So you've got the halcyon past, the beyond-hellish present, and the unknown future all right there--in 74 minutes. This is another beauty of a movie that has not garnered enormous critical praise (though Edelstein of New York Magazine likes it and so did the witty Nathan Lee--let's just say it plays well in Manhattan) but has the beauty and extraordinary cachet of being as intense as any horror sci-fi monster movie you will ever see, and in a form utterly concise. And utterly true to Manhattan. The locations are quite vivid and specific and real, and these are 73 New York minutes, full of energy and speed and in-your-face.And there is a monster--of the kind that's gigantic and terrifying but also so Japanese Fifties looking even though in color I tried to look away, because it broke the spell--which gives rise to or sloughs off more human-sized giant spider things that make a deliciously creepy crackling sound, like a giant crunchy rattlesnake, clattering and sliding around in people's faces and if it bites, watch out! You'll have a big bloody wound and after a while you won't feel too good at all.Even though '28 Weeks Later' took us down into a Tube station in similar circumstances, the stay down there in the Spring Street station with Rob and Hud & Co. stays with me. So does the first chaos on the street when they make it down from Rob's loft. This is a moderately high-budget grunge picture; it has the best of both worlds. It has tons of extras and special effects, but it doesn't dazzle you with their glitz, because you're just sort of glimpsing them through the terrified shaky hand of the, well, hand-held camera.But I really can't remember much of it because, well, I was there, man. It all happened too fast. In fact many of the incidents that occur have been seen in other disaster movies, but still, this is what Nabokov meant when he spoke of transcending the tradition in one's own way. Reeves--and bless him, he's already planning a sequel--is a director who makes it all look and sound different, constant, non-stop, and intense. You couldn't take more than 73 minutes; it would be unbearable. And even before that the novelty wears off, and again and again you realize that Hud's still having the camera in his grip and working is wholly implausible. But the style, the look, and the feel of it are compulsive and hypnotic. This may be a bad movie. It is not a movie to take seriously. But it is a good bad movie, a very good one. It will fill you up. And like Chinese food, it will leave you feeling empty two hours later. But it will have been worth it.You don't care about these people. They're shallow, emptily up-to-date, going nowhere. But that makes this all the more vérité. There are no heroes. No (human) villains. No human interest, really. Just stuff happening. Drew Goddard's screenplay deserves credit for that. And kudos to Michael Bonvillain's cinematography with its endlessly chittering video effects and the FX flow, aided by Kevin Stitt's lively cutting, which keeps things moving in and out, in and out, like a dying heart.",8,0,1,20 March 2008
Once," Perfecton doesn't have to be perfect
","Once is about a young Irish busker with a torn guitar and a raft of achingly felt songs about a girlfriend he lost the year before. He works in Dublin at his dad's Hoover Repair Centre. One day as he's playing on the street a Czech woman who sells roses and cleans houses comes up and starts to talk to him. She's somewhat cool but she's also disarmingly honest. The dialogue seems understated, offhand, but the words seem to come from the heart. She plays the piano (and later reveals she's written some songs herself) and they get together to make music. Both are suffering from love affairs that went wrong. He longs for her but she keeps her distance. The simplicity of the acting makes the characters seem real, like everything else in the movie. It doesn't try too hard. It trusts its material, and it works.The recording session they wangle with a group of other buskers (two guitarists and a youthful drummer) is a metaphor for this whole film. These people know nothing about recording, but they've got good material and the initially skeptical engineer winds up acknowledging that they've made a beautiful thing.Once's transitions are a little awkward sometimes and its images aren't fancy, but the story moves you without having any sentimental payoffs. Kitchen sink film-making: it works if you believe in what you're doing. And have something to work with. The core of Once is the music. It's what they have to work with. The studio recording session has the good feel of things coming together: it's so strong and uncalculated-feeling, it makes the studio scene in Craig Brewer's Hustle and Flow look self-conscious. In Once the sound of the music speaks without special need for dialogue or close-ups. The real love story of Once is the love of musicians playing together. Few movies perhaps have captured any better that warmth and pleasure of making music with others.People have said this is a musical. If so, it redefines the musical as some American musicals have done recently, especially Spring Awakening and Passing Strange. What makes the idea fly is that it's as if the young man and the young woman can't express what they feel for each other, and the only way they can get their emotions across is to burst into song. But the songs are their songs, not some composer's. It's all perfectly organic.Perfection, it turns out, doesn't have to be perfect.Starring Glen Hansard of The Frames and Marketa Irglova.",9,24,27,1 June 2007
Dear John," Blue-chip corn
","Nicolas Sparks is a perennially popular novelist who specializes in weepy tales of star-crossed lovers. He's written fifteen. 'The Notebook' became a movie. So did 'A Walk to Remember.' And 'Message in a Bottle.' And 'Nights in Rodanthe.' Now Lasse Hallström, a specialist in glossy crowd-pleasers, has directed an adaptation of Sparks' 'Dear John,' a story whose lovebirds are separated by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. If you want a simple fantasy about an inarticulate but brave soldier and a saintly young woman, this will do the trick. Otherwise you may wonder at the lack of rounded character development or convincing storytelling. At home by the water in Charleston, South Carolina on leave from soldiering with an elite Special Forces squad, John Tyree (Channing Tatum) dives off a pier to rescue a young lady's dropped purse. Its grateful owner is Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried).Channing Tatum (of 'Step Up' and 'Public Enemies', and a comer) looks like last year's Bruce Weber model -- muscular, square-jawed, wide-eyed, all-American, uncomplicated. He photographs as well with his shirt off as in a tight dress uniform. He has sweet cow eyes. He is the epitome of the manly hunk. He's so tight-lipped it's hardly surprising that his father (character actor Richard Jenkins, of 'The Visitor') is full-on autistic and can talk coherently only of his coin collection. It turns out Savannah is drawn to autistic folks, and one of her friends is Tim (Henry Thomas), a single dad with an autistic child. Savannah gets along really well with Mr. Tyree, but then she's also interested in Tim and young Alan (Braeden Reed, Luke Benward).Well, guess what? John and Savannah spend his two weeks of leave together and when it's over and he must return to his secret assignment, they're -- totally in love! So he promises that when his service is up in a year, they will be together. And they agree to wait. Their cloyingly repeated wish-fulfillment goodbye is 'see you soon.'Military service in this movie is strictly an opportunity to engage in passionate correspondence of the old-fashioned snail mail kind. Savannah and John exchange declarations of love and loyalty revealed to us in voice-overs. But just when John's remaining year of service is over, the 9/11 attacks happen. Poor John! Duty calls. His squad members, after a weekend during which John goes all the way back from some top secret exotic country to Charleson, all decide to re-up for duty in Afghanistan, and he can't desert them.Again during that weekend John and Savannah spend an impassioned time together. In honor of the War on Terror, she (apparently) gives up her abstinence from almost everything -- drinking, cursing (except in her mind) and premarital sex -- to make love with John. And then again they part, pledging once more to wait and 'see you soon.' But Savannah's already waited a year, and this time 'soon' starts to look pretty far off. The title gives away what happens, if you know what a 'Dear John letter' is, as pretty much everybody does. There are only tear-jerker scenes from here on -- not that that's much of a change. The epistolary saga ends. There's finally a tiny combat sequence in which John takes two bullets. Eventually, though not right away, he's retired from the service. The time period of this movie is eight years. But Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried are as pristine as ever at the end of them. Time takes its toll on John's autistic dad, and the autistic boy, Alan, is taken over by an older actor. The feel-good ending is far-fetched and trite.It's hard to see how a good movie could be made out of material like this: Lasse Hallström's good taste, polish, and restraint as a director are such (A.O. Scott calls him 'a blue chip hack') that you think he's done the best that could be done. The movie belongs to the inarticulate. Tatum comes through well. John emerges as seething with emotion, but strong in holding it back -- except for one moment of violence at home that, it's hinted, was his regular style when he was younger. But this is conviction in appearance; Tatum is given nothing realistic to do. As John's father Richard Jenkins is terribly twisted and mannered, but he has to be to project both the total repression and the sweetness the story calls for from him. Amada Seyfried is not distinctive but she is adequate, sincere -- and very pretty. But when you remember Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams in Nick Cassavetes' 'The Notebook' -- though I'm still wondering why an actor of Gosling's caliber and daring took on such a project -- you realize this kind of material can be handled better. It's hard to see what Nicholas Sparks is an expert on: not war experience, certainly; not autism. Even the behavior of his two lovebirds is only minimally convincing. Maybe coin collecting? Lasse Hallström and the writer of the screen adaptation, Jamie Linden, have not added anything to compensate. All that's left us are some acting tics and Tatum's strong silent meaningfulness.",6,0,2,11 February 2010
Crash," Shock corridors
","Screenwriter Paul Haggis' Ameican directorial debut, 'Crash,' is over-ambitious, but so is Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Magnolia' and so is Robert Altman's 'Short Cuts,' two films 'Crash' resembles in being set in L.A. and in spinning out multiple story lines that it weaves together in a complex and thought-provoking way over the course of a few intense days of screen action.Haggis's ambition isn't limited to his involving us in a couple dozen characters. It's also seen in the way he tackles the topics of alienation and racism in American cities (or is it just L.A.?).Where 'Short Cuts' was based on the quirky, specific short stories of Raymond Carver and 'Magnolia' goes into rich emotional depth in exploring its main characters (even the shallow ones like Tom Cruise's Frank T.J. Mackey are devastatingly laid bare), Haggis's characters in 'Crash' tend to be generic and two-dimensional.The two dimensions do, however, provide the rounding effect of contrast. The characters are both racists and victims of racism and most of them have some other major opposing aspect. The racist Officer Ryan -- Matt Dillon, for once using his Irishness in a blunt, unflattering way -- humiliates and abuses a well-off, accomplished black man and his wife, Cameron and Christine (Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton), but he tenderly cares for his ailing father at night, and later rescues a black woman in mortal danger. Graham (Don Cheadle), the bookend and stage manager of the movie, is quick to spot the racism of others, yet crudely stereotypes his Latina girlfriend. Another character is first pathetically self abasing, then later suicidally aggressive. Ryan's unwilling partner, Officer Hanson (Ryan Phillippe), gets reassigned to avoid the racism, but himself commits an act of racist violence. A young black man with corn rows named Anthony (Ludacris) chatters on perceptively with his pal Peter (Larenz Tate) about how they're stereotyped as ghetto toughs when they really look like UCLA students; but in fact they're car-jackers. And so on. However simplistically, the characters are all given dimensionality through having opposing characteristics. Even the endlessly bitchy wife Jean (Sandra Bullock) of D.A. Rick (Brendan Fraser) who seems without a single redeeming feature finally falls helplessly into the arms of her Latina housekeeper and thereby gains an air of humanity.None of this has the depth of 'Magnolia' or the specificity of 'Short Cuts,' but it has undeniable power. 'Crash' is relentless in pouring out calamity after calamity and isn't much fun to watch. The racist clashes, the slurs, the name-calling, the hostility are in your face from the first scene, where Graham and his girlfriend Ria (Jennifer Esposito) are rear-ended on a highway by a car full of Asians and Ria and an Asian lady immediately get out and start yelling epithets at each other.Oddly, since he seems to be both a peacemaker and a cop, Graham does nothing to mitigate this disaster and merely wanders off to examine a crime or accident scene by the side of the road, which perhaps is what they're there for. From here the movie goes back over the events that led up to this moment.'Crash's' stereotypes can be grating, particularly a mean Iranian man with a pathetic little convenience store who is bent on shooting somebody and calls everybody he meets up with a 'cheater.' He isn't any better than the prejudiced (and probably frightened) gun shop owner who calls him 'Osama' and throws 9/11 in his face, unaware that an Iranian isn't an Arab.One of the most appealing characters is the Mexican-American repairman Daniel (Michael PeÃ±a) who's called in to fix the Iranian's door. He points out that the new lock won't provide any protection till the whole door is replaced, whereupon the shopkeeper calls him a 'cheater.' The Iranian's mistrust leads to his shop being broken into and trashed and when the insurers won't pay he tries to take out his revenge on the repairman. The resulting shock sequence has been condemned by viewers and critics for being tricky and exploitive. It is, but an earlier scene between Daniel and his little daughter is the movie's sweetest moment and the only time when a resonant metaphor is born.There are other good things. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton are fine together as the affluent black couple, even if their action seems pushed to the breaking point. Ludicrous and Larenz Tate have a good rhythm as the young, not-really-ghetto carjackers. In fact the black actors are more convincing and rich in their portrayals than the white ones. Maybe that's because they're the ones who know best what racism is all about. You can argue endlessly about whether Haggis's screenplay is too schematic or doctrinaire. He obviously is not the film-making talent Altman and Anderson are. But 'Crash' is an original, striking piece of work nonetheless. It is provocative and causes extreme reactions, so people tend to say it's a masterpiece or pure junk, but the fact is that it's simply a good, but imperfect movie.",7,2,8,10 May 2005
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A brush dipped in blood and soot
","Here's a great Christmas idea for you: a movie about a man who as revenge against a cruel judge in Victorian London kills dozens of people, whom his wife grinds up and bakes into meat pies that she sells from her shop to a satisfied and unsuspecting public. And you will lose count of how many times you see this hero sit customers down in his barber chair and slit their throats, with the necks opening up and the blood spurting out in bright red fountains in the dim gray room.That doesn't sound very festive, does it? But this is a sophisticated modern musical, by Stephen Sondheim, adapted to the screen by Tim Burton with the assistance, among others, of his male muse, Johnny Depp, and his wife, Helena Bonham Carter (as Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett, his landlady, then wife, and baker of the pies)not to mention that arch-villain, Alan Rickman (as Judge Turpin, the villainous magistrate) and that facetious bogeyman, Timothy Spall (as Beadle Bamford)with a newly notorious comic scoundrel, Sasha Baron Cohen (as the mountebank Signor Adolfo Pirelli) thrown in for good measure. And they all sing, even though they're not singers by profession (though a couple of the cast members clearly areor so you'd think to hear the lusty boy soprano of Ed Sanders (as the workhouse orphan, Toby).Burton is an artist of hermetic imaginary worlds. Fortunately. Why there has to be quite so much blood, why there must be so many gleaming silver razors (they themselves key players, featured in the film's publicity) drawn across exposed throats I don't really know, but we grownups are well aware none of it is real. What it has is not the crude horror of some kind of numbingly endless snuff flick, but a unified vision, a world whose look has awesome artistic validity. And it's a vision whose artificiality, thank God, is further underlined by the prevalence of music and by how often the dialog is sung, not spoken. But more than a world of sound, it's a world of image, and if anything makes this a great film it's the fact that nobody west of Prague has ever painted so beautifully on film with a brush so heavily, voluptuously dipped in blood and soot.The dark, gloomy, overcast, oozing, perfectly hopeless London is the real star of Burton's new film. Everything else is of a piece with it. It's remarkable even how much the faces of Depp and Carter grow out of it, like the face in Edvard Munch's The Scream, and grow out of each other. They have the same cheekbones, the same white pallor and grainy dark raccoon eyes. Without being digitalized or rotoscoped or motion captured, Johnny Depp's face becomes a thing as grainy and drawn-looking as an image by Edward Gory or Charles Addams. But this is a world more fanatical and obsessive than theirs. It's not whimsical; it's driven. It's not spooky; it's horrific. I guess maybe Depp has always had the gift of negative capability, of being the more impressive for being not quite there, as much in the William Blake of Dead Man as in Edward Scissorhands. One of his gifts is that he's so powerfully present and conscious in every frame, and yet at one remove. His character is not a personality but a creature possessed by one object: annihilation, of others, and chiefly of his arch-enemy, and then of himself.Burton's achievement is that his work has never seemed less fussy. He has always been a master of detail, but it all fits into the whole here, as if everything happened inside a dark boxexcept for the wonderful short looks outside at the long vistas of narrow streets and the dark skies. (And it is said that the movie otherwise 'opens up' the musicalwith the insane asylum scene, for instance.) Anyway, what makes this a great movie is its focus, and its utter lack of distraction. And when the camera moves back a long way, those are the best, the most surprising, moments, freezing the scene into a painting. The final shot of Sweeney has been justifiably called a Pietà. Those are self-conscious tableaux, but the movement is swift, the editing is sure.This is a Victorian costume show--a horrible permutation of the Dickensian vision of the workhouse, the orphan, the perversion of justice, the greed of the powerful, the dominance of the wicked man, the long suffering of the weak, the reversal of fortune. I'm not clear why Sondheim is reckoned such a superior writer of musicals, so original. Is this original, or just a logical extreme? Isn't every ugly thing turned into a musical now; haven't musicals been dark from The Threepenny Opera to Les Miz and beyond? Sondheim's lyrics sometimes seem prosy and repetitious, his tunes lightweight. Is it a sign of sophistication that Sondheim's tunes aren't catchyor just a sign that he hasn't the gift of writing catchy tunes? None of that finally matters though, because whatever failings Sondheim may have as a pure maker of musicals all the better enable Tim Burton to make Sweeney Todd his own: Sondheim's music does not overwhelm his film but simply blends into it.There isn't much more to say. Why do I like this? I don't. It's horrific. Like another of the year's best American films that's also ugly and violentNo Country for Old Menit's just wonderfully crafted. Cocteau said Art produces ugly things which most of the time become beautiful; fashion produces beautiful things that most of the time become ugly. Which is Burton's Sweeney Todd? Perhaps a work of art; and so even its horror in our topsy-turvy world may become beautiful.",9,3,5,24 December 2007
Lost in Translation," Life in limbo - Spoilers
","He's a fading movie star in town to shoot a whisky ad and she's a young rock star photographer's wife along on a busy assignment. They're both in the Tokyo Hyatt Regency, bored and lonely and with nothing to do, out of sync with where they are and drifting away from their marriages. (They also don't seem to have brought along anything interesting to read.) They meet and have a little wistful, unconsummated affair. He leaves, and on the way out they have a few goodbye kisses. Now you know the plot of Lost in Translation. But it's not about the plot.Sofia Coppola has chosen to make a movie about states of limbo. She's also made a movie about Bill Murray's face, which oscillates ceaselessly between serious and comic, famous and forgotten, sexy and numbed-out. Most of the action happens on that face or in the engulfing shadows of the big dark hotel. The sequence where Murray as Bob Harris poses for alternate takes of the Suntory ad, with tiny alterations in his weary eyes and bored voice, is a quietly hilarious tour de force that speaks volumes about repression and anger.A clip from La Dolce Vita reminds us of the jaded wanderers in Sixties Italian art films that Pauline Kael called `Sick Soul of Europe Movies,' for which Sofia may share a nostaligia with her famous father, though Sofia is as restrained in her response to their Italian heritage as her father was flamboyant. Anyway this is 21st century American art. Compare Murray's face with Mastroianni's and you'll see how far this movie is from La dolce vita or La notte. The whole `sick soul' thing isn't philosophical or romantic any more; it hasn't even got much soul. Sofia has taken Sixties loss of will into the default mode.We may be in Japan, but this isn't Antonioni meets Kurosawa; it's Antonioni meets Joan Didion. The movie has flown across time zones to Tokyo dragging a hefty dose of California anomie with it.There are plenty of exotic images but the cinematography is pretty rather than sexy and conveys a sense of trapped airlessness. Every scenic `escape' from the Hyatt to the brightness of a party, a pachinko hall, a karaoke stage, a shrine, a TV show is illusory: Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and Bob always wind up back in their sterile rooms with their sealed off city view panoramas and their jet lag. The images rarely breathe. (They're not meant to. This is what being stuck in a big hotel is like.) Once in a while the camera selects cute Japanese guys talking at a party or playing weird video games or something. But this isn't Japan, it's limbo. The reminders of California are constant in Bob's phone calls home to his busy indifferent wife. It's even embedded in their circadian rhythms. Days pass, but they're still on California time. The sense of imprisonment in a great airless hotel is horrible and real. The Regency is a metaphor for Bob's and Charlotte's suspended state.Japan lends itself to a comedy that is funny at the risk of condescension. The `Japanese Johnny Carson' who has Bob on his show is a repellant little nelly clown. The director of the Suntory ads Bob has come to do for $2 million is a caricature too, a small, noisy, ineffectual man. (Bob is rigorously and sardonically polite with him.) Ditto the courtesan who comes to Bob's room and says `Lick my stockings,' or `Rip my stockings': the absurd, unsexy scene makes her seem remote and ridiculous. It's a bit unfortunate that there is nothing so attractive to Bob in this whole huge city as this one white woman he has met at the bar.The doubts about their marriages are there, but not to become motives for adultery. Bob instead more or less by desperate accident has a night with the chanteuse from the cafÃ© upstairs, and that's it.Bob doesn't have enough energy to commit a serious infidelity. It's his spouse who has the position of strength in the marriage: she has her life and the kids and doesn't need him. She's just a voice, the busy wife and mom at the end of the phone, and she becomes a bit of a caricature, like some of the Japanese.The movement of the film is droll, but numb. Lost in Translation is a stylish, sophisticated, witty piece of work. It's appropriately jaded and worldly-wise for a thirty-two-year-old director with a remarkable pedigree. But it's also somewhat lacking in courage because in exchange for all the polish her work has here, Sofia Coppola has paid the rather heavy price of not taking emotiional chances. Nonetheless it's a very accomplished and by no means unmemorable film.Murray's performance is, in its way, an absolute gem, perfectly modulated and, for a comic, almost thrillingly, shockingly recessive. He has spoken in public about his respect for the director and he shows it in his selfless performance. It's sharply focused, as his Polonius recitation in Michael Almareyda's Hamlet wasn't, but he never grandstands. Murray is good, damned good, but not the presence than Mastroianni was. Mastroianni could be pretty vacuous at times, but he won your heart with his charm and sadness. One can almost believe in Murray's Bob Harris, and one can't help liking him, but one can't be moved by him.There are many good details, but the overall structure isn't the best part of the movie. The final scene with Charlotte when Bob leaves his airport limo to find her in a crowded Tokyo street and exchange a real kiss seems a bit pushed. It's emotionally necessary to give the movie a conventional tinge of sentiment, but is this gesture quite believable, or even possible, in that crowd and in that traffic? Coppola is such an ironist and a realist that we're not conditioned by the movie to suspend disbelief as we would if Nora Ephron were at the helm. (It's both pushed and too easy, that last kiss.)Funnily - typical of Ms. Coppola's style which is both unobtrusive and unexpected, Charlotte cries only at the beginning.What would have been nice is if Bob had cried at the end.
Sofia Coppola already showed with The Virgin Suicides that she could work on a mature almost cult-like offbeat level. She maintains, but doesn't go beyond that here. Lost in Translation deserves attention and praise for its originality, its restraint, and for Murray's and Johansson's modulated performances. But it's rather slight, and not as funny as some people think. Actually, it's pretty sad. Suicide was more fun.",Null,1,3,25 September 2003
The Devil Wears Prada," Silk purse from sow's ear
","Lauren Weisberger's eponymous tome was a thinly-veiled memoir of her brief stint as personal assistant to ice queen Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour. It wasn't the style or the storytelling that made the book a six-month Times bestseller item. After about the fifth trip to Starbucks schlepping coffee back to the fashion maven on excruciating four-inch heels, Weisberger's writing begins to get on your nerves. You're fascinated that a young woman would put up with such torture to make it in magazines or that any fashion world boss-lady could be so spoiled and mean, but the narrative is clumsy and repetitive.That the movie sparkles is due to several things. Well, why shouldn't it? This is the world of high fashion. The pressure, the waste, the arbitrariness, are breathtaking -- but so, you have to admit, are the beauty, the elegance, and the glamor of this world. Aline Brosh McKenna worked wonders with the book, paring it down and introducing more of a sense of progression in her screenplay. The director, 'Entourage' and 'Sex and the City' alumnus David Frankel, and his team have made excellent choices, starting by casting Meryl Streep as piranha Editor-in-Chief Miranda Priestly and Stanley Tucci as Nigel, her fashion editor.It's hard to say if one would want to watch the movie without Streep -- certainly not as much; but who cares? Steely, cruel, elegant, icy, and just a tiny bit pathetic, she's a wicked delight and a huge welcome relief from such Streep frumpery as Madison County, The Hours, Lemony Snicket, or Prairie Home Companion. Who knew she had so much delightful meanness in her? This is Streep with a whole new edge. But Meryl is a great actress, so there's balance to the extreme. The brief scene near the end where she tells Andy (Anne Hathaway, the author's character, Andy Sachs) that her husband is divorcing her is a quiet marvel. For a few minutes we look into this opaque creature and discover a human being who's caring and hurt. Tucci's Nigel is similarly nuanced, not the tacky, camp creature of the book but again a subtle, modulated portrait of a gay man who's got a lot of class. And yet this is all comedy and grotesque, because the world of fashion and above all Miranda Priestly's end of it are so awesomely, absurdly over-the-top.And it's a lark from scene one, because Andy walks in for her interview as an eager young journalist out of college, but one who's never even heard of this Miranda Priestly lady, and who doesn't really want to write for Runway (the Vogue stand-in). Andy has big eyes and a wide mouth and she's pretty and she's not fat but she's a fashion idiot. She doesn't know who designed the clothes she's wearing, and she soon wishes the people in the office didn't either. She gets looked over from top to toe every time she turns around, and none of them like what they see. But she gets the job because Miranda is sick of sycophants. Not that she doesn't expect and demand that Andy will obey her every whim, and right this instant now, and 'that's all' (which is how her commands all end, not with a 'please' or a 'thank you').Streep is effective because she is never, ever shrill. She speaks always in a calm, low, modulated voice. 'I cannot understand what you find so difficult about the instructions I have given, which were perfectly clear.' That kind of thing. It's like the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland, it's crazy and it's autocratic -- Miranda is the supreme ruler of her considerable domain -- but we know that Andy is doing this only for a year, for the experience and for the line on her CV; she's not trapped in this world. And there are tiny, tiny signs that Miranda is favorably impressed by Andy's performance, despite the absolute absence of thank-you's or words of praise.What also makes the movie work well is that fashion is about the way things look, and this is a pretty film, much meaner than Funny Face but as visually appealing. Lauren Weisberger is free with names, but she never makes us quite see the svelte 'clackers' who hover around, or the exaggerated, hugely expensive clothes -- above all she can't show us how Nigel and staff dress Andy up to be seen with her boss. In the movie the sleek transformation unfolds breathtakingly before our eyes.Absent from the movie is most of the book's meanness and hatred and bad language and Andy's nightmare drunken roommate. A lot of the grouchiness is absorbed into personal assistant number one, Emily (the able Emily Blunt, Tamsin in the dreamy My Summer of Love), who also takes the bump from a car the roommate gets in the book, but emerges less scathed.Andy's suffering ghetto schoolteacher boyfriend Nate becomes an aspiring sous-chef played by spaniel-eyed cutie Adrien Grenier of 'Entourage' whose biggest problem is achieving a killer port wine reduction. Andy's a central character in the movie but not the narrator and we're not stuck inside her head. The movie still has a little posse of underdeveloped friends, though, including a black woman photographer who has a big show, whom we never quite understand or see the point of. Luckily, the focus is always chiefly on queen bee Miranda with her vague commands and clear threats, and Andy trying to keep up, never quite succeeding, but still surviving beyond anyone's wildest expectations, so that before the end when Miranda tells Andy in the limo in Paris during the big fashion week, 'You remind me of myself when I was your age,' we're startled but not entirely surprised. This is the paradox that sustains the story: Andy hates Miranda, but she wants to please her. She hates this world, but it dazzles her. We leave the movie with somewhat the same feeling.",8,1,2,9 July 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Ben Affleck's rough and arresting directorial debut
","In the poor South Boston neighborhood of Dorchester (writer Dennis Lehane's birthplace) the TV news and an avid public are all over a story: a little girl has been kidnapped. Family members want Patrick Kenzie (Ben Affleck) and his girlfriend and partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), young missing persons detectives, to investigate. Police Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) objects. Police detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) aren't friendly. But Patrick and Angie are tough and they persist. It's they who unravel what turns out to be one of Lehane's typically tangled webs.Gone Baby Gone doesn't completely work as a movie, but it's still a very interesting directorial debut for Ben Affleck--who took a wise risk in trusting his younger brother Casey for the central role. Casey's no novice, but never a star till this year. He's arresting as the shifty, insecure Ford in Andrew Dominik's arty Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, and he embodies innocent idealism equally effectively here. Ben also took a risk in deciding to go for grit, with many actual denizens of the low life world it depicts used as minor actors.Dennis Lehane's story set in the white ghettos of Boston, which forms the movie's basis, isn't as deep and dark and mystical a tale as his Mystic River, filmed four years ago by Clint Eastwood to great acclaim. But the issues this film raises are simpler, plainer, and ultimately more troubling: they go to the roots of the uneasy equation of morality and class. And despite use of some solid pros, including Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, this one doesn't have the distractions of Eastwood's star-studded cast.Casey Affleck is small. He's nice looking, but not as commanding or handsome as Ben. He has a rusty, reedy voice that doesn't carry; it just stands in the air. He also has a quality of freshness and surprise, as if the camera's caught him off guard but he refuses to flinch. His Patrick Kenzie will stand up to the toughest, most evil people in Dorchester: he has balls of brass without seeming to know it, or to know any other way. It's this strength from the early scenes, where he's tentative, yet unyielding, that gives conviction to his later choices.The film is anchored by Morgan Freeman in the important secondary role of the police captain, a man who's lost a child to kidnapping himself and now heads a Crimes Against Children unit. The other main role is Ed Harris' as the feisty, mysterious detective from Louisiana; Harris shows his stuff here; he's hard and slick without cliché. Some commentators have objected to Ben's use of bloated bar bums and other authentic white ghetto locals; they've said these salty characters are too distracting and pull the story down into an inferno of lowlife immorality.But that's the point. From the first, when Bea McCready (Amy Madigan) and her husband, Lionel (Titus Welliver) appear to seek Patrick and Angie's help three days after the highly publicized abduction of their little niece Amanda, things feel fishy. This is a world so hopeless and off center it crawls with sleaze. It soon emerges that Amanda's single mom Helene (Amy Ryan), Lionel's sister, is a real mess, more into turning tricks to buy drugs than minding her little girl. She's a drug runner herself, and the abductors are probably people she's embroiled with.The incredible, troubling question that will arise is whether Amanda's mother is at fault herself; if she cared; and obviously, if she was a fit mother. But can she be faulted for the lowness of her own life? Taking us into convoluted lives and twisted emotions warped by deprivation, addiction, and traumatic loss, the story at times seems like a slum version of something from James Ellroy's ultra-lurid (but highly cinematic) 'L.A. Quartet,' with similarly twisted machinations and motives in a Lehane permutation. Nobody is what they seem to be, except for Patrick and Angie. The unraveling revelations may strain credulity, but they keep you paying attention.The movie is very strong on atmosphere and situation, not quite so good at sustaining the forward momentum of the action. Most of what happens seems to come through flashback or review. The investigation tale ends, and then it picks up again later. I'm not sure the movie ever recovers its energy, and yet still t it gets much more interesting, despite the fact that it flounders a bit somewhere midway in the denouement. But then the moral dilemma comes hard in the face of the young investigators--and us--an issue so clearly posed and firmly dwelt upon that we carry it out beyond the credits.8 1/2-9",9,1,3,11 December 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," They make more of the same and yet it still seems new: that's why the series can go on
","The Bourne stock is high. Paul Greengrass, who's made the last two, is a good director. He proved his mettle with his documentary-style history film about Northern Ireland, 'Bloody Sunday,' and another one last year, 'United 93.'Once upon a time action films ended with a chase. In the stripped down action world of Jason Bourne, the whole film is a chase. And that is fine. Matt Damon is a brilliant action star; he IS the Bourne franchise, as Bruce Willis is his franchise. Bourne is a new kind of hero. He is a cipher who suffers, a hyper-kinetic version of a spy hero, because he doesn't know who he is, and everyone is his enemy, and he is always in a foreign country. 'The Bourne Ultimatum,' the latest, but no doubt not the ultimate, of the series, begins with Bourne in Moscow, and then moves on to Paris and London and Madrid and Tangier and New York. Bourne is equally at home--and equally a stranger--in all these places, and we love this blurry world tour with bodies and bullets and cars flying. Jason Bourne doesn't know who he is or what happened but he has astonishing skills. He's the ultimate human weapon, lethal and indestructible, and he speaks good Russian, French, German and Spanish and can open any door, get past any code, dodge any pursuer. He is a wily trickster. That makes him a character of folklore, a creature of our dreams.But let's not kid ourselves. With each successive sequel, the series is growing thinner. 'The Bourne Identity,' which was based on a Robert Ludlum novel and directed by the young Doug Liman (Greengrass is ten years older), took the time to establish places and people and had the intense relationship between Bourne and Marie (Franka Potente) -- something approaching a love interest. Potente had an air of recklessness and danger that made her a good match. This was the essential Bourne film. It began with Bourne emerging from the water, like some kind of sea birth. 'The Bourne Supremacy' (the ante is upped in each title, as if screaming to be noticed) also had a long prelude full of tropical atmosphere. It had moments of tragedy and betrayal. The first film had Chris cooper and Clive Owen and Brian Cox. Cooper and Owen dropped out,. and we got Joan Allen and David Strathairn. Albert Finney seems a rumpled version of Cox., and he is underused.But the spy-chaser machinery brought to bear against Bourne is really meaningless except as a foil. Nutty as the CIA is, would all of Langley be marshaled in a giant war room to track down a single man--who only attacks when he's attacked--and whose threat seems to be that he may remember who he is and what he was supposed to do? Doesn't that make us all dangerous? The marvel is that the CIA can track Bourne on TV monitors all over the room that come up with sound and pictures and tap into cell phones at a yelled command from Strathairn. The believable part is that Bourne always dodges or offs the CIA 'assets' who're after him and escapes from the net. And Bourne catches them all napping and they lead him directly to the information they seem to want to hide from him. That part is very convincing.'Ultimatum' is a post-Abu Ghraib story, showing that hoods and water-boarding and sleep deprivation were used in Bourne's training. But in year seven of Bush II, the arrest of some CIA chiefs for using harsh tactics in their black operations seems unlikely. These are just brief allusions, anyway: the special ops, even though there's a new one revealed, 'Blackbriar,' were more fully developed in 'The Bourne Supremacy' than here.Greengrass uses a technique of very rapid editing and very unsteady camera (Liman's camera work did not require Dramamine, but his does). He introduced that in 'Supremacy,'' and he continues it in 'Ultimatum.' This style in time may date, but for now it makes the visuals seem fresh.It always seemed Matt Damon was an awfully funny kind of matinée idol, a strange degeneration of the Hero: he looks more than anything like a burly bellhop. But he has proved in various films that he's a good actor.-- particularly adept at showing self doubt or emotional disconnection. I prefer Malkovitch's Tom Ripley to his, but his (in Minghella's film) gets best at the core of Patricia Highsmith's antihero -- his lack of affect. Though the Bourne action goes so fast you barely get a chance to appreciate it, Damon's obviously also an athlete. He may be no kung fu star, but better than that, he convinces you Bourne is not a showoff but simply a deadly physical opponent.Given the increasing dilution of content, it's a bit surprising that the Bourne franchise films are seen as 'intelligent' or even that they're seen as 'spy' films. Yes, there's something classy about them, and they're not dumb by any means. They're battles of wits and skill as well as brawn and technology. And they are great fun to watch, even though the material is getting diluted and stretched.David Denby cites Manohla Dargis as saying that 'the drama of 'Identity' was existential (Who am I?) and the drama of 'Supremacy' was moral (What did I do?)' and concludes that 'the drama of 'Ultimatum' is redemptive: How can I escape what I am'? Very neat, but rather artificial, since all these questions occur in each movie, and yet there is no answer in any of them. It is another kind of stretching, this time by the film critics, to attach profound significance to these three movies and make them into a trilogy. It makes more sense to imagine the filmmakers considering how they can make more of the same and yet make it still seem new. They succeed at that, and that's why the series can go on.",8,2,4,4 August 2007
Nightcrawler," Creepy-cool performance by Gyllenhaal nails America's TV gore-hunger and job desperation
","Writer-producer Dan Gilroy's directorial debut Nightcrawler is a smooth, brightly colored, compulsively watchable movie that plays with journalism, employment desperation, and the motivational online-educated loner world of a marginal news bottom-feeder in the mean streets and freeways of Los Angeles. He's Lou Bloom, a lonely Angeleno who's hungry, driven, and amoral. Jake Gyllenhaal becomes an intense character actor here, moving way beyond the obsessive crime investigator he played in Fincher's Zodiac. Taking the coyote as his metaphor, the actor dropped 25 pounds for the role and played his scenes grinning, bug-eyed, and always literally hungry. Though with need and ambition instead of poetry in his heart Lou might fit into the fringes of the Hollywood outcasts of Nathaniel West's Day of the Locust. Now, Gilroy hasn't penned a high literary work. This is a kind of sleazy thriller, but with a witty satirical edge and an implied strident message. It knows not the network of corruption we find in James Elroy, only carjackings, baby killings, and home invasions. At its center is a creep we love to watch, and in spite of ourselves almost sympathize with. As we meet Lou, he's a scavenger (like a coyote), selling found or stolen copper wire and manhole covers to a wholesaler and delivering a comically detached, motor-mouthed job application that's instantly rejected: 'I won't hire a f-ing thief!' But Lou happens on a bad car accident with a bloody victim and encounters the nocturnal world of free lance videographers who feed off accidents, selling lurid footage to the TV stations for the best price they can get. It looks perfect to him. He steals a fancy mountain bike and sells it to buy the tools of this game, police radio, camera, and starts chasing cop cars and ambulances He hires a desperate 'intern' called Rick (Riz Ahmed) he hilariously 'interviews' in a luncheonette using business-model lingo and agrees to pay a retainer of $30 a night to be his navigator and assistant, decoding police case designations, picking best routes. Suddenly, Lou is in his element. TV news at its most lurid 'viewer discretion advised' level feeds off human misery just the way Lou does.Importantly, Lou develops a purchase source, the aging woman director of the region's lowest-rated TV station, called Nina (Gilroy's actress wife Rene Russo), a kind of desperate poor relation of Faye Dunnaway in Network. She buys and sells fear to suburban white people. 'The perfect story is a screaming woman with her throat cut running down a street in a good neighborhood,' she says. Lou bargains intensely to raise his prices and status with Nina, and he clearly wants her as well as her patronage. Lou isn't clueless about people. He just doesn't like them. In fact he knows very well how to manipulate them. To speak of 'chemistry' between Gyllenhaal, Russo, Ahmed, or Bill Paxton, who plays Joe Loder, a more experienced photo 'nightcrawler' he follows, then climbs over, would be absurd. Lou exudes a kind of sweet, misleadingly innocuous-seeming poison, which doubles as creepy charm. Lou has gotten into all this by breaking the law, and it's not long before he starts overstepping bounds even more dangerously. His eagerness to get to news sites before his competitors, like Joe Loder, who humiliate him for his clumsiness and poor equipment at first, soon leads to his getting himself and Rick to crime or accident scenes before the police do. And soon enough he winds up essentially involved in and covering up a crime in order to get a scoop. But skimming the margins of the permissible and the legal is all in the cause of local TV and the business model works, even though some of the workers don't survive. Now there are several weaknesses in this movie. But they are not Lou's hilariously glib and clueless patter and the disarming manner in which Jake Gyllenhaal delivers it, nor the stunningly filmed speed chases in Lou's newly acquired red Mustang and the other dangers and excitements, nor the glowing day 35mm. film and night digital cinematography of multiple-award-winner and Paul Thomas Anderson regular Robert Elswit (Magnolia, There Will Be Blood). But the screenplay might have spread wider its picture of corruption beyond merely the camera hacks and the ratings-mad TV hacks who exploit them; the police are knights in shining armor here, so a whole dimension is missing. The movie further should not have been quite so continually caught up in Lou Bloom's own obsessions. It needed to step back and look at him from some cooler angles. Despite the more strident than necessary editorializing, and too intensely cynical, this isn't exactly fresh new ground that's being broken here. But it's still a creepily engaging, wonderful-to-look-at movie. If it's astonishingly polished and mature for a directorial debut, that's partly because of experienced family help. Dan has a twin brother, John, who's an editor, and another brother, Tony, who's a writer and director, and they were both on hand to help. Gyllenhaal, who co-produced, evidently contributed substantially to the spirit of the enterprise. And he delivers an amazing performance, as do Rene Russo and the rising British star Riz Ahmed. Nightcrawler, 117 mins., debuted at Toronto. Watched for this review at The Academy Theater at Lighthouse International, NYC at the courtesy of Academy member Marilyn Stewart, 29 October 2014.

The Aviator," Crazy about flight
","What's the point of a biopic, anyway? Is it meant to be a sort of crude cloning, like a waxworks effigy at Madame Tussaud's but with moving images? Or is it meant to delve into the secrets, show us the real man or woman behind the public mask? In the case of Howard Hughes, we already know all about the weirdness. What Martin Scorsese means to do is to show that Hughes was also a heroic figure in the history of aviation, and a playboy who had a great deal of fun. That may be a bit of a stretch: Hughes's story is full of epic foul-ups, spectacular wastes of money and time and lives to satisfy his mistaken whims, not to mention morally dubious actions; but nonetheless Scorsese's new movie, which focuses on Hughes's early, triumphant decades, is fun to watch. It soars and sparkles This is where Leonardo DiCaprio comes in. Did Scorsese just choose DiCaprio to get a big budget for his aviation epic? I don't think so. There's more logic in it than that. Yes, Leo is too young-looking and reedy-voiced, but the movie in many if not all respects works anyway, and so does DiCaprio's performance. It's fun seeing the fine clothes and high life. DiCaprio looks great all duded up: his face and body fit quite well with 20-'s-30's-40's styles, and he's equally believable as party boy and ladies' man.Scorsese's version of Katherine Hepburn -- who turns out to be one of the linchpins of the movie -- isn't too far off. At least her story gibes with the way the actress herself tells it in her memoir, About Me, which explains how her ex-husband's presence and her family's snobbish, clubby ways put Hughes off, how she discovered he was hard of hearing but tried to hide it, how they were too much alike to stay paired off for more than a couple of years. Cate Blanchett as Hepburn however not only doesn't look at all like her (she isn't as sharp and stylish), any more than Leo looks like Hughes; despite her obvious mimicry of the voice, she also doesn't really deliver her lines with the clarity, the rhythm, and the panache that Hepburn unfailingly had. But hers is essential as the liveliest female presence and so very much needed in this macho story about a boy and his toys.The Aviator isn't too long if you accept that it's an epic. But can you do that? It's a colorful and unique story, but beyond that it doesn't quite know what it is, a clinical case history, a piece of hero-worship, an epic, a tragedy, or a comedy, and so it self-destructs, almost, toward the end, when the fun ends and the craziness increasingly begins to take over. We can certainly be glad it wasn't cast in the form of a solemn tragedy. It could have been made a comedy throughout. Hughes's obsessive-compulsive/paranoid meltdowns are tragi-comic.The aviation sequences are so amazing you wonder how they did them. One simple answer is, by spending lots of money. They must have cost as much as Hughes's extravagant projects. Again, this aspect of the movie is a bit of a whitewash, because DiCaprio makes crashing planes look heroic rather than foolhardy.People have commented on the 'clever' (actually too obvious) way breasts and clouds are connected, and how Hughes's fondling of a woman segues into his feeling of a new plane's shell for perfectly flush rivets. What's clever is how DiCaprio's face as he 'flies' is both rapt and manic. Aviation comes to life as a higher calling, perhaps one of the great ones of the twentieth century, but technological progress as a kind of madness, a Luddite's 'I told you so.' Leonardo is not so good as a crazy man. Growing a beard only makes his face look younger. We can believe him as a wild spender. It's harder to believe him as a recluse. (He's more often seen walking around buck naked than cowering in a corner.) But whatever you say, this movie's fun. At least it is till the craziness takes over. And even then it's fun, because Hughes is seen rallying from his longest crazy spell to triumph before the Congressional committee, stomping out to general applause. And DiCaprio works because he has the power to dominate the scene. What is best about DiCaprio is his exuberance -- always -- and his boldness, and those are the aspects of Howard Hughes Scorsese is playing with.All the way through Leo does that wrinkled-brow charming-eyes look Orson Welles used to do, and you think of Citizen Kane. The Aviator may not be Scorsese's Citizen Kane but it's a fascinating movie and much more successful than the ill starred and lugubrious Gangs of New York. There are numerous splendid spectacles in The Aviator and they all have a glitzy glamour about them and are perfect for the wide screen in a big Cineplex. But is this what made the Scorsese of Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas great? No. He's been seduced, not by money, but by movie grandeur, and he's moved far away from his boorish New York roots. In that he somewhat resembles Zhang Yimou, who's also moved toward pure spectacle, and with even better results -- not, of course, doing the biography of a modern figure.The question remains: why do directors do biopics? Is Scorsese really looking for himself in the mad failed movie director, the obsessive compulsive recluse, as Oliver Stone is said to see himself in the megalomaniac Alexander obsessed by his mother? That may be a better answer than it seems.",Null,5,11,20 December 2004
Burn After Reading," A carnival of human folly
","In Burn After Reading the Coen brothers turn to a new genre, the spy story, and they shred it and, along with it, their cast of characters. Typically for the Coens, there's tight construction, quick pacing--and a somewhat unseemly delight taken in human stupidity--in the course of which a number of A-listers are coaxed into working hard to demean themselves. This at least is what the critics are mostly saying. Now, in fact, the action's a bit puzzling, and the finale a tad unsatisfying. But what some reviews seem crucially to overlook is that there's much fun to be had here for viewers, not only in absurdities of dialogue and action--in the seemingly helter-skelter 'clusterfuck' plot--but in the way the extreme story elements and satirical characters are destined to undercut whole chunks of movies you'll be seeing in the near future. You've got a group of types. There's the ice queen wife (Tilda Swinton), her alcoholic husband (John Malkovitch), the cosmetic surgery-seeking plain girl (Frances McDormand), the ambivalent philanderer (George Clooney), the gym bunny (Brad Pitt), the good bloke (Richard Jenkins). Then you've got the various people they're tied to or get involved with, none of whom matter much except for a 'CIA Superior' (J.K. Simmons). The machinations of the gym bunny and the plain girl (co-workers at a gym called Hardbodies) are reported to Simmons by an agent. They're trying to extort money from ex-spook Malkovich and sell his info to the Ruskies. Simmons gives orders to minimize damage and make some sense out of it all. It will be hard any time in the near future to observe any such characters and plot elements in another movie and not be reminded of how devastatingly they were twisted and mocked by the Coens.The CD-rom Pitt and McDormand find at Hardbodies contains some intelligence-valueless memories of Malkovich's just-ended CIA career. He calls them a 'league of morons,' but he speaks too soon, because he's an idiot himself. Cruelty and anger do not make a man smart.Reviewers accuse the Coens of meanness, but satire doesn't have to be nice. It is good to be able to laugh at ourselves, to see our own folly. The excellent and very famous actors who perform in this movie may understand that better than the critics do. They know the value of having a bit of fun--of laughing at themselves. They're not so much demeaned as set free of their solemn garb as tragedians who weep in a movie like Babel (as Brad Pitt did), or snarl and get tough like Clooney in Michael Clayton, and so on.The action takes place in the environs of Washington, DC. The CIA, as moviegoers know all too well by now, is over the border in Langley. The opportunists, lobbyists, and exploiters, the poseurs and dreamers and has-beens, are everywhere--in the real DC, that is. This is a specialized and notional one, for the Coens are artists.The Coens do not always succeed. There's a slight risk in their returning to mockery after the solemn horror of their literary adaptation of last year, Cormac McCarthy's No Country for Old Men. They had never worked off somebody else's story before and the purity of their accomplishment grew from their playing another's music, so to speak. In their own mode, ever since Blood Simple, the brothers have been cruel both to their characters and their audience--cruel in a way that gives excruciating pleasure in the suspenseful moments of Blood Simple. They can become too reductive and condescending, as in O Brother, Where Art Thou?, or too crass, as in The Ladykillers, or just boring, as in The Man Who Wasn't There, or merely conventional, as in Intolerable Cruelty. And as clever and able as they are, it is still true that when they have most succeeded, it is n partly by accident, as in Barton Fink, which owes much to the dorky intensity of John Turturro, and thegargantuan genius of John Goodman; likewise The Big Lebowski became a thing far beyond their abilities because it stars Jeff Bridges--and again the great Goodman.But enough of the filmography--which in a way this movie has nothing to do with. Its virtue comes from its working a new game, the 'clusterfuck' of schemers and cheaters so mixed up with each other everything ultimately implodes--with a plop.The 'clusterfuck' grows out of greed, vanity, and lust. The Coens' alleged 'cruelty' comes from the stern morality of the satirist.Clooney is sleeping with everyone he can, and that includes Tilda Swinton, Cox's (Malkovich's) wife, a mean pediatrician. McDormand, whose vanity makes her want thousands for wholesale cosmetic surgery, is dating via the Internet, and thus she starts seeing Clooney too. Clooney goes to Swinton's and Malkovich's house when Malkovich is away, and then Pitt goes there in search of more state secrets. The critics think Pitt is the dumbest character of all. But he is the most selfless: he only wants to exploit the discovered data because it excites him to do so, without any real ulterior motive or plan. Malkovich is motivated, as in so many of the actor's roles, mostly by malevolence, and this time, the perversion of feeling that arises from alcohol.The Russians are not in bed with anybody, but the CIA has an inside man at the Russian embassy. The lesson of John Le Carré: the Secret War is always behind the times.Other than this, it is dangerous to reveal the plot; the trailers already revealed too much. The devil is in the details.",8,3,9,13 September 2008
The Bourne Identity," The Bourne Identity is good dirty fun; it's not mindless, either
","A certain well-known American movie critic has said `Bourne Identity,' Doug Liman's entry in the big budget spy film world, is `unnecessary.' `Unnecessary'?  I think it's very necessary to have a good crisply made action movie with cool romantic locations, a tough, inscrutable hero, a durable female sidekick, and a bang-up conclusion.  We need good entertainment that pretends to be no more.  What a relief `Bourne Identity' is after the laborious disappointments of `Minority Report'!Bear in mind, though, that the same thing has been done before in a TV miniseries version of Robert Ludlum's 1980 novel made in 1988 and starring Richard Chamberlain.  And bear in mind that the novel is 22 years old. And the depiction of the CIA as invincible and potently evil is laughable post-9/11.I guess you have to go back a while to find fun these days.Matt Damon comes through beautifully in this movie.  He has a tautness and an edge of insecurity that are more than skin deep and the physicality to do his own stunts. He wasn't quite right to play Tom Ripley, but that wasn't his fault.  Here stripped of identity he does fine. I tend to think of him as best cast as a bellhop, but he's earned a second chance. There's a chemistry between him and Franka Potente that isn't hurt at all by Bourne's coolness toward Marie.  Chris Cooper as the CIA headman is a stereotype but Brian Cox as his boss has a sphinxlike vulnerability Â– it helped a lot that I knew him best as the charming creep in `L.I.E.'  All the bit parts are well played here.  The CIA sequences are overblown and silly, but they keep the energy and excitement high, and their occasional shrillness is counteracted by the intimacy and edge of fear in all Damon's scenes with Potente. I love the minimalist dialogue between Jason and Marie. The Stoic ideal is not dead.As many car chases as we've seen in our lives, this one through Paris in an Austin Mini-Cooper beats all for clarity, neatness, and speed.  The choice of the tiny but ultra-maneuverable British car was brilliant because this is a vehicle that really can get between the cracks.  Here as elsewhere the humor is subtle and not broadcast in our faces.I wish Liman had stopped jiggling his camera so much.  Even when Marie's reading a paper, the camera shakes like a man with palsy.  So her French sucks; she isn't 85.  But these quibbles subside as the action surges forward.Is this a meaningless story? Hardly.  The mystery of identity is one of the eternal questions of philosophy.  Here it's just played for fun, but it still can make you think.  According to the old Latin rule dulce et utile, the sweetness makes it useful, i.e., this movie instructs while it delights.",Null,0,1,25 June 2002
28 Weeks Later," Wise and weird and scary
","In '28 Weeks Later' Danny Boyle and Alex Garland have stepped back and produced, consigning the sequel-making task to a Spaniard, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, of the 'wildly precocious' 2001 'cerebral occult thriller' 'Intacto.' With his several co-authors, Fresnadillo has turned away from '28 Days Later's' sci-fi (though there's still a hopeless apocalyptic vision; but is that sci-fi any more?) to moral and political levels of blunt allegory, while still playing with the fate of an England besieged by the high-energy Rage zombie virus. Perhaps a hyper-kinetic zombie is a bit of an oxymoron; one remembers the good joke of Edgar Wright's 'Shaun of the Dead' that the north of England chaps wandering the streets of his film are so downbeat and sluggish zombies pass among them unnoticed. But the Rage virus is a thing for our times. These new zombies burn themselves out in an infectious fit of techno-mad impatience, A.D.D.'ed to the nth degree.There were always betrayals within a family under zombie attack, and anybody who crosses over is a double-crosser, but what about a husband and father in a big house outside London under zombie attack who simply loses it and runs off to save himself, leaving his equally terrified wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) behind? Robert Carlyle, who has played Hitler since his stint as Daffy in 'The Beach' and who has a perpetually pained expression, has the role of this coward dad, Don. His young son and daughter, Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots), miraculously survive. But you'll never trust your mother or father again, and Andy and Tammy's parents combine physical and moral infection. In this highly suggestive story line, the sickness that infects the family and the corruption of the state are of a piece.The infection of the personal level continues with a medical officer in charge, US Maj. Scarlet (Rose Byrne), who wants to save these siblings not because they're rather sweet but because she believes they may have a rare gene resistant to the Rage virus.The political, which is to say military, level of '28 Weeks' is much more complicated and makes less sense till you hear one thing: the separated-off center of London -- guarded and controlled by the American military -- is called The Green Zone.Thus the 28-week declaration that England is 'free of infection' matches the idiocy and folly of George W. Bush's premature declaration of 'Mission Accomplished.' Why are Tammy and Andy, the only children allowed back in the country after lifting quarantine, able to sneak out at evening when the Zone is locked down, grab keys from a corpse in a pizza shop and ride a delivery motorcycle out to their old house? The same reason why everything was allowed to go haywire and looters had free reign after the US invaded Baghdad: S.N.A.F.U. Who's in charge? Nobody thinking with his head. Green Zone indeed.Once there is re-infection, the black C.O. doesn't want to protect the siblings with the rare genes. That would be thinking too far ahead. Genes, smenes: everybody goes down. So, now that a new infection has appeared (always within this little family; the neat story construction requires no more), the snipers are called out. What's the point of shooting everybody in sight down there? Because it's a Red Alert: enough said. It's the rainbow sign. No more water: the fire next time. Why shoot everybody, friendlies and bad guys alike? Because the C.O. says so. S.O.P.= S.N.A.F.U. The only thing that's missing from this movie are Shiites and Sunnis and Blackwater.Why fire-bomb the whole area when that won't work because people/monsters can still get out of the Green Zone? Same reason, every time.This film has its share of fresh effects, including the sight of masses of fleeing people being enveloped with shooting flame. Hey presto: firestorm, as the late Kurt Vonnegut put it. Fresnadillo & Co. handle their tasks with relish and panache, and in the process evoke Dresden and Tokyo and, with its hovering helicopter, Mogadiscio and 'Black Hawk Down'. There is a conventional good-guy Delta sniper Doyle (Jeremy Renner), who's human enough to abandon his post and help the innocent, and he gets torched for his trouble. That kind of outcome, as well as the few swaying hulks, is a lingering tribute to Romero. But the manic kinetic energy of those possessed with the Rage virus is at such a high pitch this time those old fashioned shots of backyards full of looming, lurching zombie hulks are no longer to be seen (go back to 'Shaun of the Dead' for a good one). Instead, '28 Weeks,' as Nathan Lee comments in his admiring review, is great at balancing high and low, public and intimate, aerial shots with bloody in-your-face slam-bang close-ups. The sequence where Maj. Scarlet guides Tammy and Andy down through a big darkened Tube station knee-deep in infected corpses using an automatic weapon's night scope is wonderfully ghoulish and icky.'28 Weeks Later' makes a metaphorical virtue of every conventional narrative fault. Nothing makes sense? That's because the solution to the re-infection of Tony Blair's constituency is under the control of the American military he kowtowed to. The 'solution' just makes everything worse and worse? What did you expect? The last shot: on to Paris. (For some Freedom Fries, perhaps?) Don't listen to any naysayers: this is a good one.(Best reviews of the film: by cool-guys Walter Chaw at Film Freak Central and Nathan Lee in The Voice. Liked Chaw's tribute to Joe Carnahan's first film: 'Fresnadillo adopts the hand-held ethic of Boyle's picture and injects it with the energy of the vertiginous opening moments of 'Narc'.' Right on.)",8,0,2,14 May 2007
21," Dross into dross, for fun and thrills
","Luketic ('Legally Blonde,' 'Monster-in-Law') provides a few thrills and some pretty mindless fun in this more or less reality-based story about a half-dozen college students involved in a risky but successful get-rich-quick gambling scheme supervised by their MIT math professor. Interest is provided by the contrast between the dour snow-covered Boston area setting of the Ivy League school and the glitter of Vegas. Kevin Spacey plays the manipulative, larcenous prof who masterminds the scheme and Lawrence Fisbourne is his old hood nemesis, protecting casino interests. It's slumming for such good actors to indulge in this sort of shallow diversion, but they add tone to the proceedings. A movie like this that skips over details like fine-tuned dialog, character development, or intelligent exposition cuts little ice with critics but is catnip at the box office in this winter-release dead time. Younger viewers can if they choose enjoy the images of honor roll kids grabbing quick money at the Blackjack tables in a world of danger and romance; gambling freaks may fantasize on sequences wherein players beat the tables for hundreds of thousands. The risk factor is real: 'counting cards' may not be illegal in playing '21,' as Spacey's character says, but a team working the tables in a coordinated operation using secret signals is the best possible way to get casino goons on your tail.The weaknesses of 21 are many; nothing works too well unless you watch with your brain on hold. The young characters have no depth. Spacey and Fishbourne are on hold too. Spacey, whose classroom talk predictably has precious little to do with MIT-level mathematics, is never anything but a bossy and threatening smart aleck. Fishbourne is a tough and relentless meanie, about whom we know only that he's soon to retire without benefits and that he once knew Spacey as a Blackjack ace long ago. The details of the game and the counting are mushed up. The pleasant enough, mildly cute young English actor Jim Sturgess as Ben, the brilliant new recruit of Prof. Micky who becomes the team's big player, is about as lackluster and generic as a young lead could be. As his sidekick on the team and erstwhile girlfriend Jill, the (also) cute, stylish-looking Kate Bosworth is another actor whose talents are debatable and whose character is so underwritten as to be nonexistent. For 'color' we get one Asian guy, Choi (Aaron Yoo), who adds a few lines and a head of wacky, Basquiat-like hair. The real-life Asian identity of most of the MIT team has been dropped. An excellent online discussion by Ian Kaplan (bearcave.com) gives evidence that the fictionalized true story '21's' based on, 'Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions' by novelist Ben Mezrich, is a page-turner, but itself shallow and poorly written--and possibly exaggerated as to the amounts of cash involved. A weakness in execution in the movie version is that the team members don't use disguises until after they think they've been spotted. They don't ever change their signals, and the key one is ridiculously obvious. It's doubtful that Ben could come in as a high roller, win big, and then just move to another nearby table; the real life team had to win often but small--and in many other places besides Vegas. Ben also violates the rules of winning by counting by being flashy and getting on a first name basis with doormen as well as staying at deluxe comp suites with Jill, another gauche attention-getter. He would have been spotted and barred. The team's partying a lot and going on shopping sprees when they win big are two other obvious no-no's. Are they trying to get caught? And the depiction of the tables action is simple, one scene hard to distinguish from another. Director Luketic and his writers Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb don't know how to make card play compelling and specific. The prof, Micky Rosa (funny name for somebody teaching non-linear algebra at MIT, but real name of an actual Blackjack ace) is accompanying the kids to Vegas and getting half their take, but what follow-up supervision is he providing? No wonder that when Ben succumbs to hubris and messes up big time and Micky dumps him they decide to proceed on their own. The movie provides a level of violence the real life account lacks. Counters are usually barred, not beaten. The movie nemesis Cole Williams represents a whole team in real life, shown here as giving way to computerized devices; in reality both high tech and human elements are used to protect casinos from being wiped out. But in general the movie has, by the evidence, dumbed down and simplified an already low-IQ book.The movie's narrative framework is as mildly clever but shallow as the whole. Ben is being interviewed for a full scholarship at Harvard Medical School where he's been accepted and the interviewer tells him to get this special prestigious all-expenses 'Nelson' award he needs to exhibit 'startling' attributes and tell a story that 'leaps off the page.' This is that story. Only trouble is, he's trying to raise the $300,00 he needs for Harvard throughout the narrative. 'Did that leap off the page?' Ben asks the interviewer at the end, who responds with a dumb look. We're supposed to respond to all this with dumb looks too. Ben is provided with a naive mom who offers her limited life savings to put him through Harvard Med. He also has two nerdy MIT best buddies working on a science robotics contest whom he drops when the excitement starts and then touchingly reunites with thereafter. Neat, and dumb. Movies have been known to spin weak books into gold; not this time though. Luketic & Co. have spun a book with an interesting story to tell into a down-time diversion that rated only a 48 on Metacritic. But in spite of all this, it still has some entertainment value.",6,2,3,2 April 2008
Cold Mountain," Glossy, underwhelming adaptation
","SPOILERSAs usual with Minghella this is a glossy production with glamorous stars - Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Renée Zellweger - and some great supporting actors - Donald Sutherland, Brendan Gleeson, Eileen Atkins, Natalie Portman, Philip Seymour Hoffman, -- the list goes on and on: Ray Winstone (as the evil Teague) and Charlie Hunnam for once as an evil guy, Teague's Home Guard sidekick. The freshman Hunnam turns out to make a great evil guy, and Jude Law is every bit as handsome as the magazines always say he is. Nicole is a blooming dewy pink rose, even when laboring in the fields like a hired hand. Every hair is in place, even when they're out of place.
Renée Zellweger, as Ruby, for a while unquestionably breathes quite unexpected life into a story that constantly loses energy and momentum. The Reverend Monroe (Sutherland) dies in a rainstorm; as in the Charles Frasier novel, Ada is quickly fading when left alone by her father's unexpected demise. The young Inman, despite the energy of his love for Ada, seems perpetually about to die. There's not much excitement in foregone conclusions. Ruby however comes in to save the citified Ada and with her jumpy energy and matter of fact coping skills she keeps the farm going. It's a charming but somewhat ambiguous performance, at once selfless (for the recent star of Chicago and Down with Love to look so comically dumpy) and attention-grabbing. The audience is thankful for it. Inman's `Odyssey' -- as he wanders from the hospital AWOL back home to his love, Ada - is a constant faltering. The movie would die on the vine completely without jerky, manic characters like the tireless Ruby and the wicked Junior (Giovanni Ribisi) to liven it up.The battle sequence is extended beyond anything in Charles Frazier's book (which I think may owe something to Cormac McCarthy but lacks McCarthy's poetic prose and his epic sense of doom; and itself is constantly faltering), but it's still short, that battle, and it's so beautiful, with its Delacroix panoramas of flying limbs and nude torsos and explosions and mud, that you wish it were longer. It's the high point of the film. But it has little essential to do with the whole story. It's just a lovely, inspired tableau.This is, basically, a teaser love story: two people meet a few times briefly. They're separated by a war; they are reunited very briefly, and it's over. When they first meet, a certain gap of station and money holds them apart but the chemistry is evident. The movie telescopes the romance but pumps up the smooching. The Civil War comes, and Inman goes off, but long before the couple has their passionate kiss Minghella has made it very clear they're totally gone on each other. In the book, Ada never actually sends a letter to Inman. They're in love in Charles Frazier's version; it's just that in the movie, with its emphasis on spectacle rather than inner experience (despite voiceovers), the romance has to be heavily underlined. There's no time in all the spectacle, it seems, to show it developing.
There's an awful lot of killing, despite the battle being done with early on. The story emphasizes how dangerous the lives of people are away from the actual direct confrontations, with soldiers raping and pillaging. Even moms of suckling babes mow down enemy soldiers with shotguns. There's an implication that the South had to scare its people into loyalty: the Home Guard represents an evil element in the South. Teague and his boys in Cold Mountain, North Carolina, the place the deserter Inman is heading back to, are perpetually hunting down deserters and Federal sympathizers and terrorizing Ada. Teague wants her land, which he once owned, and her.
This is too eventful a movie, made from too flat, rambling, and badly written a book. The adventures of Inman are constantly cut in with Ruby and Ada's progress toward friendship and self-sufficiency and so forth, but when Ada and Inman finally meet again it's one night of lovemaking and then Inman is killed by Charlie Hunnam's evil young Home Guard after a battle with him and Teague which Teague loses. And so the tease ends. Except that there's the epilogue where we see Ada happy with her `family,' Ruby, Georgia, her husband now, their children, her father, Sally the widow neighbor. . .a sunny scene, everyone together at a table outside and the musicians playing.
The strongest emotion Cold Mountain evokes through its long length is horror at the brutality of war. It's like you're being cattle-prodded every five minutes: Look! Look! War bad! It's an anti-war story in some sense, but the romance powerfully dissipates the energy of anti-war sentiment. And Nicole, as so often lately, is too pretty and perfect. The inner lives of the two principals aren't evoked well enough for there to be much more than some romantic twinges in it, and some horror.This may be Jude Law's best star turn yet in what has already been a distinguished and varied career, though one that has still lacked one great movie and one great role. Nicole is a splendid star, but too much so for the nitty gritty life Ruby is supposed to be taking her into. The two, Ada and Ruby, make an odd but charming combination.What you're left with after Cold Mountain is over is no very strong emotional impression, just a sort of Classics Illustrated Comic Book kaleidoscope of vivid visual images expensively risen from their story boards. Previously Minghella made glossy stuff out of an arty novel, Ondatje's English Patient, and it was embraced by American audiences but seemed like a Masterpiece Theater mini-series all run at once more than a movie. Then he made glossy stuff out of a sort of camp classic, The Talented Mr. Ripley, and despite one or two terrific scenes it lost its edge through the wrong alterations. Now he has made glossy stuff out of a clumsily written Civil War epic, and the result falls flat. His movies are too full of themselves. Cold Mountain leaves you underwhelmed. The prettiness, the ugliness; the explosions; the kisses: it's all too much, and none of it adds up to anything in the end. The movie is fine as a spectacle and in its parts: if that were all movies were about, Minghella would be a great director.",Null,0,1,1 February 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," A perfect little film, truly fun and surprisingly real
","Little Miss Sunshine is a splendidly simple piece of screen stagecraft: it is about characters and a situation that brings them all together, and as only a film can, it takes them on the road. So it's a road picture. About a weird family in New Mexico whose members all get roped into taking a little girl to California to compete in a kind of beauty pageant for little girls. Actually the family isn't so much weird as it is heightened. The father Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker with a 'nine steps' program he's concocted. He's full of confidence and looks like a successful businessman, only he isn't successful; he's a failure. He's no Tony Robbins; he isn't anybody, and he's broke. His 15-year-old son Dwayne (Paul Dana) is a depressed teen who's taken a vow of silence and reads Nietsche all the time; he wants to become a fighter pilot and won't speak till he's assured a place at the Air Force Academy. The wife and mother Sheryl Hoover (Toni Colette) is struggling with the family's problems, but she's not so unusual in herself. The grandpa, dad's father Edwin (Alan Arkin), is a grouchy but spirited eccentric. He's been kicked out of a retirement community for, we must presume, using foul language, advocating promiscuous sex, and taking hard drugs, things he does freely now at home. And a new addition to the household is Richard's brother Frank (Steve Carell), a gay professor and the number one Proust scholar in the United States, who's just attempted suicide over a male student who dumped him in favor of the number two Proust scholar. He's lost his teaching post, had to live in a motel, and been passed over for a MacArthur genius award for Proust scholar number two. The Hoovers rescue Frank from the hospital. Frank's put in Dwayne's bedroom, where Dwayne writes a message on a pad: DON'T KILL YOURSELF TONIGHT. Olive (Abitgail Breslin) is just a little girl with an enormous enthusiasm for competing in a beauty pageant. She's sweet and has a nice smile and pretty skin but she's ordinary looking and has a tummy and wears big glasses. There isn't much time to get Olive to the pageant in California when she learns she's allowed to compete, and there's no way Richard will permit but to drive in their old VW bus. The bus soon loses its clutch and it can't be fixed, so they have to give it a running start by pushing it or drifting it down a hill. The element of surprise is important to the pleasure Miss Sunshine can abundantly provide, so it's impossible to reveal how the story progresses from there. All we can tell you is that on the road, the family members don't escape from their problems or their dysfunctions; these continue and have to be confronted. The pageant, when they finally get there at the very last possible minute, is a bit of a shocker for all concerned. It's a sign of how admirable this little film is that one can't sum up its world-view, though one feels it does have one. There's something about families here: their unexpectedness, the way people in them seem more extreme than they are, and turn out to be better than anybody thought. There's gentle fun made of institutions and laws and politicians and the humidification of childhood and the crass culture of 'winners' and 'losers,' but nothing gets in the way of the story, and one's never distracted or bored for a single minute. Minor characters are treated rather cruelly, as is the beauty pageant (it almost makes one gag) and the film's economy also means the omission of some explanatory details. But simply drawn as the characters are (and despite Sunshine's Sundance Festival origins), there's no sense of indie cliché or indie contrivance or indie cuteness here. This is a triumph of minimalism. Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, who directed, and Michael Arndt, who wrote the screenplay, have put together a beautiful thing. It wouldn't have worked, of course, if the actors hadn't all contributed so ably and evenhandedly to the enterprise. The result is truly fun, and surprisingly real. P.s. Okay...near-perfect. But in the field of this year's (2006) American films, it's damn-near perfect.",9,1,4,17 September 2006
The Orphanage," Uneasy beginnings
","Juan Antonio Bayona's first film 'El Orfanato' has the formidable sponsorship of Guillermo del Toro. He's also found US distribution for it by Picturehouse, who handled his celebrated 'Pan's Labyrinth.' The latter shares certain elements with the screenplay by Sergio G. Sanchez, another first-timer. It concerns a couple living in a former orphanage whose adopted seven-year-old tragically disappears, causing the mother to resort to mediums and séances and seek communion with the dead through reliving her own hidden past. Del Toro not only produced 'The Orphanage,' he has chosen to personally promote the film. And since it is a premiere effort for much of the film-making team (except the actors), its polish is impressive; moreover the story is a sophisticated one. But both story and treatment wind up being little more than a high class horror moviewithout the gore of the current crop, but with a lot of loud sound effects designed to jerk you out of your socksnot to mention the usual crumbling corpses, hideous masks, and doors suddenly shut behind innocent victims. One step forward for some young filmmakers in Spain; but another step backwardand no competition, needless to say, for 'Pan's Labyrinth.' This is another sign of FSLC and New York Film Festival director Richard Pena's admirable support of Spanish language films, but it is not the brightest gem in the festival's crown this year.An opening flashback shows young Laura playing with five companions at an orphanage in a big old house thirty years ago, just before Laura is to be adopted. Flash forward, and a 37-year-old Laura (Belen Rueda) and her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) with seven-year-old son Simon have moved back into the very same old orphanage, unused now, preparing to renovate it to house a small number of mentally and physically handicapped children.Simon (Roger Princep) seems uneasy in the new location. He doesn't sleep well, and has dreamed up some imaginary friends. Various signs suggest he's somehow connecting with Laura's childhood. Once a scary fake 'social worker' (Montserrat Carulla)an old lady with thick glassesworks her way briefly into the house to give Laura a threatening interview, things turn permanently bad. Simon mysteriously is led to find out two things about himself Laura and Carlos weren't going to tell him till later: he's adopted, and he's HIV-positive. During an initial reception for the new home, Simon refuses to come downstairs, and shortly later he disappears. This reception sequence seemed to me the most creepy and memorable of the film, its use of handicapped children in scary masks eerily reminiscent of the photographs of Diane Arbus.Laura carries out a desperate and hopeless search for the missing boy. After six months she arranges through a specialist in parapsychology to have a medium, Aurora (Geraldine Chaplin) come to the house with a team of observers. The result of this episode, which involves night-vision imaging, TV monitors, and other tech devices, is that Aurora thinks Simon is somehow connected now with the orphans who lived in the building thirty years agoLaura's contemporaries and pals. Actually, we knew that; the elaborate business is absorbing, and Chaplin delivers a stark, haunting turn, but it adds nothing new and from here on in some sense the screenplay gets tangled in its own complications.Earlier discussions with Simon about Peter Pan (he announces he's never going to grow up) introduced themes of regression and eternal childhood. They flow in and out of the film hereafter. Carlos is of the opinion that the former orphanage has bad vibes and they need to leave, or at least take a break from being there. But Laura refuses to go, so Carlos leaves her by herself. Thereafter things get very complicated and the screen belongs to Rueda, whose emotional intensity and sensitive face carry us through a series of sequences involving reenactments of childhood games and other physical experiments by Laura to communicate with her pals from the past and find out what happened to Simon. The film flows in and out of reality and sanity and, frankly, lost me at some point here, so that whether the ending is satisfying or not isn't something I'm prepared to say.Thematically this is an interesting screenplay, but the use of very conventional, if slick, horror film shock devices would tend to alienate the fan of straightforward drama. 'Pan's Labyrinth,' with its richer canvas and constant shifts back and forth from a child's fantasy (or supernatural) world to a grim present political reality provide a far more satisfying and complex experience. Excellent performance by Belen (who previously co-starred in 'The Sea Inside'), and a promising debut for Bayona, Sanchez, and their team. The sound design is effective, but over-the-top.",7,10,20,29 September 2007
"I, Robot"," Mechanical rehash
","Star Will Smith (who's yet to be in anything better than 'Six Degrees of Separation' and 'Ali') and director Alex Proyas (why can't he return to the sublime Gothic schlock of 'The Crow' and 'Dark City'?) both deserve better than 'I, Robot.' This movie may provide you with a little bit of fun but nothing can hide the fact that it's poor genre stuff with slightly upgraded software. And movies are not computers, and we're not robots, though the industry likes to think that. 'Blade Runner' does the trash-futuristic city thing infinitely better (and is not alone in doing so); '2001: A Space Odyssey' (not to be mentioned in the same sentence) does the existential angst of artificial intelligence more cosmically and 'A.I.' does the machine's longing to be human more painfully and humanly. This movie has only a few ideas, watered down from Isaac Asimov, and it tends to belabor them and dumb them down (Akiva Goldman is to thank, or curse, for the final script). First let us begin with the very emphatic product placements: Converse All Stars, to which a whole scene is devoted, and Audi automobiles. If you're going to chase a running robot through crowded streets, you'll need those All Stars. If you're chased by a gang of mad cybertrons driving huge trucks armed with robotic fork lifts, you'll want to be behind the controls of an Audi  which cop hero Del Spooner (Smith) drives in a number of demolition derby sequences, one of which almost makes his cyber-prosthetic left arm fall off. Why do the stars of these future flicks wear leather jackets? Maybe those are product placements too. So is FedEx, now delivered by annoyingly obsequious mechanical men. And there's a little plug for adopting stray kittens, which shows Spooner's softer side. Will Smith isn't a robot and the contrast of his awesomely pec-ed tawny torso with the spindly silver ant-like bodies of the robots, which are blue-eyed to boot, is all too obvious. The pecs are repeatedly shown off in bedroom moments, and then strongly hinted at by the loose pullover Will wears for all other scenes. He seems to have gotten in character, as Hollywood stars often do nowadays, by going to the gym. There's a dame, an uptight, almost robotic robot shrink, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) who gets loosened up by her need to bond with Will after the ritual initial sparring. The movie observes one rather special and arbitrary rule that viewers of A.I. can't but think odd: all robots look alike. I guess that makes the digital effects cheaper and our sense that the mechanical creatures are an enemy army clearer. Their stick-figure look is pretty boring though, after the riot of robot generations and looks in A.I. The people of Chicago, where this is supposed to take place, are faceless too. There's a cocky teenage boy who Spoon knows, and Spoon's granny (Adrian Ricard) who bakes him pies. The unkindest cut is that a robot can learn to make them just as tasty. Spoon doesn't have the complication of a wife or girlfriend to deal with any more -- that's a story the movie doesn't get into. Then there's the genius robot inventor Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), whose apparent suicide Spoon is sent to investigate. Since the inventor is huge  the company he started is about to put out a robot for every five humans in the country (not the world; in fact we don't see beyond Chicago) and he's scion of a great company, and since Spoon is a bit of a wild card, it's odd he'd be sent to investigate  but then, he's Will Smith. Will is a sort of middle class, ghetto dressed dominant male in this. Not much of a stretch. And he has a human directness and secure sense of himself that makes him shine compared to irritating, self satisfied company CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood, who's thin, always a bad sign-Spoon's friendly cliché police boss  Chi McBride -- is fat) and the lady shrink (who's got a tight, mannish hairdo; but never fear  she lets the hair down later and becomes a real woman). And then there's Sunny (voiced by Alan Tudyk), who's sort of R2D2 with (metaphorical) balls and a longing to lead.Spoon meets the CEO and dislikes him, because while the scientist was a pal, this snake heads a company whose slogan, Spoon thinks, should be 'we s**t on the little guy.' The robot explosion is represented as a megabucks capitalist enterprise to displace workers and sell hardware, which is tied in with their being treated as a slave class. That's one of the movie's Asimov-lite ideas. The others concern the nature of the robots. 'The Three Rules' (of Robotics) are the essence of robot programming as benign servants of mankind: they're hardwired to be incapable of doing anything harmful to their masters. Spoon get this  distrusts robots because one of them saved his life. See the movie to find out how that works. An opening sequence  the movie starts to creak when you look at how it's put together  shows how quick Spoon is to assume robots are up to no good. Which of course is justified, and he's the only one to know this, and so it must be or there'd be no plot and no superhero. It all leads to the Spoon punch line to the lady shrink, 'Somehow 'I told you so' just doesn't quite do it.' The movie has a few moments, such as when Sonny gets interrogated by Spoon to see what's wrong with his program, and a few of the street scenes where robots blend in with people. The big trouble with I, Robot, other than its simplistic, not to say dumb, script, is as so often happens nowadays in Hollywood that the ideas and the characters get overwhelmed by the special effects, in this case the armies of digitalized robots, who give Will Smith an opportunity to be an action star (in a void, I guess) but quickly infantilize the proceedings. I'm not sure if Spoon's motorcycle is a product placement or not, since few people would recognize the custom job that it is, and anyway there are only a few of them available. Maybe Will Smith, who crashed one at 60 m.p.h shooting the movie, also got to keep one as part of his paycheck. Makes you want to be a star. Very wanly recommended, though as one critic has written, if you go, the sequel will be your fault. Maybe better just to go out and buy an Audi, or, if that costs too much, a pair of Converse All Stars.",Null,0,0,28 August 2004
Wanted," Russian touch, Scottish charisma
","This gonzo visionary-pop Russian director ('Day Watch,' 'Night Watch') makes his Hollywood debut with a splashy actioner, unoriginal and even more unbelievable in its far-fetched graphic-novel-based story of a meek man turned super-hero but striking for the craft of its details and featuring a central character who gives things a fast-beating heart and draws you in by seeming as scared by his exploits as you'd be.To fit an American movie mold Bekmambetov throws aside the fantasmagoric Russian vision of his sci-fi vampire spectaculars and focuses on chases and battles, but from scene to scene he maintains an exceptional level of craft. Apart from car and train chase scenes that outdo most others, this is a veritable treatise on superhero ballistics. You've seen the slow-mo magnified bullet thing before but he makes them a little more psychedelic and surreal, his ace shooters so precise their bullets meet in midair and we see them collide and split, even if they're curved to go around obstacles. The Bekmam is evidently still excited by what he's doing and he rises to the bigger challenges like gangbusters.This movie damns all logic. A car jumps up over another car and upside down the driver picks off his victim. In a gorgeous climactic sequence a long train crashes down a mountain ravine caught at the top, undulating like a giant Slinky, while adversaries do battle within and without. Moments like this are satisfying to look at for their color and texture as much as for the cool preposterous way things dovetail and whip around; the movie never falters in maintaining its energy and distinctive look.The film stars Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie as familiar, if elegant, arch villains, but there's a new guy on the block: James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson, the timid, terrified, unwilling débutant killer-trainee they recruit, whose to him unknown father was one of them and who therefore is found to possess genetic peculiarities that make him capable of paranormal feats of mayhem and carnage. His 'panic attacks,' for which he pops tranquilizer pills daily while trudging back and forth to a demeaning office job as an accountant, are a sign that his heart can go up to 400 beats a minute and his adrenalin can pump so hard he can see and shoot off flies wings. Yeah, well, you had to be there.'Wanted' is full of stretchers, but they are what make possible all the splendid visual tricks. They'd quickly pall, though, were it not for McAvoy's humanness as the meek, trampled-over Wesley, whose overweight, obnoxious female boss Janice (Lorna Scott) makes life at the office miserable, while his best friend (Chris Pratt) is screwing his snippy girlfriend (Kristen Hager). McAvoy, who has played the Scot that he is notably in 'The Last King of Scotland' (a virtuoso role despite being overshadowed by Forest Whitaker) and a wide variety of Brits, including the victim in 'Atonement' and a disabled punker from Dublin, not too surprisingly reincarnates himself completely not just with an American accent, but a whole American young guy's voice, maybe a little like the young Tom Cruise's but sweeter and less needy. It's an act of ventriloquism and rebirth as cool and astounding as any of Bekmambetov's gimmicks and as essential to the movie's success. Hard to praise McAvoy too much or to think of any other actor today who could have brought such vividness to his initially meek character and still take up the physical demands of such a role with comparable energy and verve. This guy is talented. It was obvious he could handle all sorts of emotions and personalities, and now he turns himself into a hyperkenetic hunk. So two gifted foreigners smash into Hollywood blockbusters with a bang here, the Russian director and the Scottish star. And this movie is a lot of fun, even though the rather creaky comic book mythology of the secret order of weaver-assassins who need to recruit a new guy to take out a rogue member just gets hokier as it goes along. The 'Loom of Fate' that spells out the next victim in a code of warp and weft? You have to take it all on faith, but that's easier when things are flying through the air. We've had convenience-store-pharmacy shootouts so often before they're getting to be a standard scene, but the one early on here that makes Wesley's intro to Fox (Angelina) and the ultra-violence of The Fraternity (the assassins society) is so violent it recalls the over-the-top joke gross-out one in Gregg Araki's underrated 'The Doom Generation.'Morgan Freeman as The Fraternity's boss-man Sloan is typically authoritative but his hectoring, sententious lectures to Wesley quickly grow tiresome; Jolie's Fox however has an offhand panache. Her role has been criticized as underwritten, but she does plenty with the will-timed monosyllable, the cunningly displayed tattoo, the anorexic arm extending an outsize silver pistol, and the pouting lips. Her performance says if you've got it, you can just flash it; you don't have to flaunt it. As an essential foil to Wesley's panics and ebullience, she is dashing and cool, and between them there's a kind of low-burner romance both are too busy to indulge in. To see Fox draped upside down on the front of a speeding Ferrari with guns blazing in both hands is to realize what a long way female, like black actors, have come as American fantasy heroes--leaving reality in the lurch.But while there's a ton of stuff you can learn from comic books, most of that gets lost in the noise of screen adaptations, even though the hokey Walter Mitty platitudes about living life to the full are compensated by some truly wonderful physical feats and ocular trickeries. This is not like every other $75 million action movie (and Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk cost twice as much, by the way).",Null,3,7,5 July 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Judd and Jake out of their depth
","Judd Apatow, whose involvement in social comedies has been so successful lately, teams up with his 'Freaks and Geeks' collaborator Jake Kasdan and dancing actor John C. Reilly (who showed us some nice soft-shoe in Chicago) to attempt a satirical musical biopic in Walk Hard. Drawing obviously on Walk the Line, Ray, and other sources, these guys do their best to provide some Christmas end-of-the-year cheer, but their 'hard walk' goes soft and staggers toward the end. Cox is a catchall of a pop singer, a chameleon Zelig/Forest Gump whose life from age 14, where Reilly absurdly takes on the role from a younger actor, till early 70's, runs through blues, soul, country, punk--you name it--with appropriate drugs. There's pot for soul, LSD for psychedelic rock--Cox gets to hang out with a crude version of the Beatles in India with the Mahirishi. Cocaine leads him to punk--and so on. The trouble (or one trouble, anyway) is that though he's game to a fault, Reilly is colorless to begin with. It's impossible to believe teenyboppers would swoon for him. He has zero sex appeal. And that isn't funny like Steve Martin's 'wild and crazy guy,' either.The constant shifts of musical style neglect to give Cox any unifying factor whatever. Apatow might as well have used six different actors for Cox, a la Todd Haynes with Bob Dylan. And Cox has a Dylan phase. Only you know what? The Dylanesque lyrics aren't at all funny, and satire ought to appeal to devotees. This is a music movie about a musician who hasn't a scintilla of musical authenticity. Or even a consistent shtick.Of course there are plenty of laughs, but Walk Hard is little more than a string of jokes and rough-hewn, even gruesome stunts. The way relatives are killed off seems infantile violent, while the sexual humor is adolescent. Jokes like the humping motions of couples in a black club, and the Jewish music producers dressed in full Orthodox regalia and with names like Mazeltov and Dreidel really appeal to the basest responses of the audience. This is way too sloppy work to compare with witty musical satire, and Apatow's and Kasdan's catchall screenplay seems lazy--ultimately uninventive.Of course this is meant to be Reilly's picture, but he's the victim of it.While it's been said the string of songs composed for Reilly to sing ups the ante for such satire, the incessant shifts in style keep the movie from every coming close to achieving the subtlety and point of a classic comic music movie like This is Spinal Tap, which defined a genre and style, or an oddball serious fake music documentary like Brothers of the Head--both of which evoke the worlds and times they come from brilliantly: Walk Hard doesn't really try.The movie's only (questionable) new note is the incessant mockery of the devices of music biopics. There it does have a clear and relentless point. The trouble is, it apes those biopics too closely. Again, Apatow and Kasdan have been lazy and unimaginative, good only at reaching for laughs--and too often reaching mighty low for them.This movie turns humble musical rural people into trailer trash. It's a trailer trash movie. But where the biopic evocation falls short is that Cox really has an easy time of it. He's neither a Johnny Cash nor a Ray Charles. He doesn't suffer the consequences of his drug use or his marital failures. So the 'hard' of Rock Hard is only a word, unlike the genuine rough life lived by Charles and Cash. This is the trouble with taking everything lightly--and going to overly gruesome extremes to show a dark side of the past. It veers from the bloody to the shallow, with nothing in between. Of course the lighthearted approach was okay, in fact downright welcome, in the youth comedies of Knocked Up or Juno or the trivial adolescent coming of age hassles of Superbad--moments in young lives the kids are going to move on from. But for a life from 14 to 70, this approach leaves you feeling empty.",7,7,18,23 December 2007
The Battle of Algiers," No winners
","Perhaps no other cinematic depiction of revolt against colonial rule is so detailed, vivid, and specific as the 1965 Battle of Algiers (La battaglia di Algeri, just reissued in a new print and having limited distribution in the US). It's a vivid and very specific recreation of the insurrection against the French in Algiers in the late Fifties that shows how the French systematically eradicated that insurrection. It's also a story repeated with variations in dozens of parts of the globe now, as then. But as I'm not the first to note, it's neither a partisan tract nor a user manual. It was therefore foolish of the Pentagon to watch it recently as if tips on how to control Iraqi `resistance'/'terrorism' were to be found in it, and it has been equally foolish of the Black Panthers or other revolutionaries to watch it seeking tactical information for their struggles. Those tactics did not succeed; but neither did the effort to quell the independence movement: the French won the battle but lost the war. A process that might have proceeded peacefully in a matter of months, takes years to happen. The film documents the sad foolishness of solving conflicts with violence, the maximum loss and suffering on both sides and the protraction of the inevitable outcome.
The insurrection The Battle of Algiers describes was effectively quelled through the leadership of the bold, methodical French Colonel Mathieu, who as we see succeeds in eliminating the organizational structure of the resistance, `triangle' by `triangle', using torture to ferret out names and locations of the autonomous `terrorists'/'partisans,' then killing the `head' of the `worm' their structure represents so it can't `regenerate.' Once this happens, after a merciless French campaign following a general strike, the sympathizers in the majority Algerian population are totally demoralized; but two years later a vigorous national independence movement `suddenly,' `spontaneously,' springs forth, and not long afterward France has to grant Algerian independence. It's at this point, rather than at the moment of Mathieu's momentary triumph, that the film ends.
Gillo Pontecorvo undertook his masterpiece after prodding from the resistance leader, Saadi Yacef, but he made a film equally sympathetic toward and critical of both sides. We see as much of the French dissection of the situation and repression of it (by the police chief, then Colonel Mathieu) as we see of the `terrorists'/'partisans' planning and execution of their actions. We see Colonel Mathieu as an appealing macho hero with moments of noble fair play, a shades-wearing, cigarette puffing veteran who moves around with clarity, honesty, and panache; he himself has a `partisan' background. The `terrorist'/'rebel' leaders are serious, intensely committed men of various types, from the sophisticated intellectual to the young firebrand. There are no `heroes' here; or, alternately, if you like, they're all `heroes.'Mathieu appears before the press beside the captured `rebel'/'terrorist' leader - an unusual move in itself - and expresses his respect for the man's courage and conviction. The `rebel' leader in this scene is eloquent in defending `terrorist'/'rebellion' methods such as the use of baskets filled with explosives in public places. `Give us your bombs and we'll give you our baskets.' Mathieu for his part effectively explains to the journalists the necessity of torture to short circuit the `rebellion'/'terrorism'. After this explanation, the film, typically systematic at this point, begins showing a series of tortures of Algerians being carried out.
The first image we see in the film is the shattered face and body of the small, tortured Algerian man who's broken down and revealed where Ali `La Pointe,' the firebrand, the last remaining leader, is hiding. Then we see the `terrorist'/'terrorist' leader Ali and his closest supporters trapped like deer in their hideaway, their faces soft and beautiful. The splendid black and white photography works like William Klein's Fifties and Sixties images (he's one of the key visual commentators of that period stylistically) to powerfully capture the edgy soulfulness of the North African people and their gritty Casbah milieu. Much of the film's power comes from the way Pontecorvo was able to work, through Saadi Yacef, directly in the Casbah among the real people - as Fernando Meirelles worked in the favelas of Brazil recently with local boys to forge the astonishing City of God.The voices, which are dubbed, as was the fixed Italian filmmaking style, work somewhat less effectively because of obvious disconnects between mouth and sound at times, but the French is so analytical and the Algerians' Arabic so exotic-sounding (even to a student of Arabic) that they work, and the insistent, exciting music composed by Pontecorvo himself in collaboration with Ennio Morricone is a powerful element in the film's relentless forward movement.The fast rhythms of the editing are balanced by the stunning authenticity of the hundreds of Algerian extras who swarm across the screen: it's in the crowd scenes that The Battle of Algiers really sings. There are many superb sequences of street fighting, of people massing at checkpoints, of the French victims innocently assembled in public places; and like an exhilarating coda there is the scene of joyous victory as Algerians celebrate their independence in the last blurry moments. This is a film (again, like City of God) of almost intoxicating -- and nauseating -- violence, complexity, and fervor. Pontecorvo's accomplishment, though, is the way through showing the leaders analyzing and debating the action he freezes any impulse toward partisanship in its tracks. The evenhandedness of the coverage works a Brechtian `Alienation Effect' so you don't get caught up in rooting for one side or the other.The sequence of three pretty Algerian women carrying out an operation is a particularly memorable one -- but only one among many. First they take off their burqas and cut their hair and doll themselves up French style and then they get past the checkpoint into the French quarter to leave handbags full of explosives in a bar, a dance club, and an airport lounge. Again close-ups of faces in the bar and the jive dancers with jaunty jabbing elbows in the club show a brilliant use of image and classic editing: first the innocent, vulnerable faces, then the explosions. Here our sympathies for the French victims are fully awakened. Another sequence of Algerians removing bodies from a building has all the power and sadness of Christ's Passion.
There's no point where as in a conventional thriller we feel excitement and sympathy for the perpetrator, because we see the cruelty of the perpetrator and the humanity of the victim every time. The Battle of Algiers is a final triumphant use of Italian cinematic neorealismo. The killing is observed neutrally, but with sadness, as part of a stupid game caused by ignorance and played out compulsively when a political settlement would have been infinitely better - a stupid game observed with astonishing zest.
Revived thirty-five years later in a new 35-mm. print, its grainy beauty pristinely vivid, The Battle of Algiers remains a superbly made machine that plays out the addictive game of `terrorism,' repression, torture, revolt, and full-fledged insurrection as effectively now as when it was first issued. Like any classic, it's of its time and of all time. There's a lesson here, but it's not for partisans or colonialists: it's for all people.",Null,213,224,23 February 2004
Disturbia," A little run for your money
","D.J. Caruso can draw you in, as he did with the phantasmagorical Salton Sea and the initially engaging police procedural, Taking Lives. Disturbia's premise is derivative -- it's a teenager version of Hitchcock's Rear Window -- but manages to seem fresh. The movie is set up with more detail about character than is usual with formulas for the genre. The paradox is that when you compare it with Hitchcock's more genteel world all that was necessary in the earlier film is a little dialogue, not a fishing scene or a violent car crash. The contrast shows how crude and brutal Hollywood movies are now, how much they have to labor to achieve their effects. Jimmy Stewart had a broken leg. We have to see Shia LaBeouf doing poorly in Spanish class, being pushed by the teacher, and then socking him and getting sentenced afterwards to house arrest.This is good in a way. We've never seen a teenager confined to home for 90 days with an ankle sensor before. You can feel his frustration, his gorging on junk food, his trashing his room. And then the binoculars come out and he starts visually stalking the neighbors and finds a babe and a creep out there. It's fun to watch Kale (LaBoeuf) and his pal Ronnie (Aaron Yoo), who's a comic, skittish, loose canon kid, get excited watching Ashley (Sarah Roemer), the shapely new girl next door. Indeed Ashley is a dishy jailbait blend of Gwyneth Paltrow and Uma Thurman. It's cool how Ashley just walks into Kale's house one day and almost starts smooching with Kale right away, and Kale sneaks up behind her and smells her hair. All this updates the trapped detective genre with a vengeance and makes Rear Window look tame. But Hitchcock's movie develops a mystery through visual clues effectively because of Stewart's suave inertia. LaBoeuf is all over the place, and then when we get to the menace (because it's menace rather than mystery that comes), the movie hits us over the head with it, bombards us with loud 'scary' booming music. By this time all that's been going on, straining to hold our attention above the sound of crunching popcorn, though its inventiveness has charm, also gets in the way of the suspense (which needs to be more obsessive and focused than this) and leaves you at the end sort of wondering if the bad guy really existed.But we must give Caruso credit for both originality and pop instincts. Shia LaBoeuf may soon be the flavor of the month. He is without the complexity of a Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the pop sex appeal of a Justin Timberlake, or, to reach a bit, without a hint of the charisma of a River Phoenix, but as twenty-something movie 'teenagers' go, he's got different, and for a mainstream filmmaker like Caruso, good, stuff. He's slightly humorous, yet angry and impulsive (he's a loose canon too, obviously; that must be why he and Ronnie are pals). What's distinctive about him is he's neutral without being uninteresting. LaBoeuf is a sort of twenty-something 'teenage' Everyman.What makes you realize you're in a formula picture is that loud music, with the booms and the little sound effects. Once it kicks in you're stuck with it for the duration, and it drums up stock scare responses so powerfully you're ready to jump at every shadow or moving object. Caruso has done a lot of television. Salton Sea's craziness was interesting till it meandered too long; it did have the virtue of being completely weird and pointless. Taking Lives, with a miscast Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke, still seemed intriguing and original for a while. This time with Disturbia Caruso carries you through to the end quite nicely if you don't expect too much.The visual style here, the tech fun of cell phone camera hooked up to TV monitors with text messages saying 'look at your TV' -- even the old ploy of hooking up loudspeakers out the window to disturb neighbors' pool party guests (surprisingly, with Minnie Ripperton) is engaging and up-to-date. But the use of grainy images to scare us because we don't know what they are backfires because the menace remains so vague it's just generic. You're beginning to find the whole movie becoming a blur. Throughout Disturbia -- a good name, that -- hinting at the seedy underbelly of the middle class and the confined teenager's frustration -- its virtues gradually turn into partial weaknesses. In the end it's just a little entertainment. It makes you care about its young hero a little, amuses you a little, scares you a little. Then it's over and you're back with a teenager who's exonerated himself, but still isn't really going anywhere, and an ending that's been completely rushed. There's no sense, as in Rear Window, of a tricky, threatening villain tracked down and stopped, or of getting to the bottom of a mystery that had come to intrigue us.Still, nice work by nearly all the actors, and a great role for rising star LaBeouf, who might turn out to be interesting as well as typical if he gets some good roles.",7,0,4,18 April 2007
The White Ribbon," A portrait of collective evil
","'In The White Ribbon,' the masterful film that won Michael Haneke the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year, the Bavarian-born, Austrian-raised writer-director turns to a period costume drama shot in black and white. He focuses on the year leading up to the outbreak of WWI in a fictitious village called Eichwald in the northern, Protestant part of Germany where the local baron (Ulrich Tukur) employs half the population. It's a time and place where people were unusually evil: Haneke has said something like that about his setting. The story is riveting and its presentation is brilliant -- performances that are memorable and vivid; settings that are authentic-feeling; images that linger in the mind. The effect is chilling and though-provoking.There is a series of malicious and cruel acts. A trip-wire causes the town doctor's horse to be crippled and the doctor (Rainer Bock) is hospitalized. The baron's little boy Sigi is found tied upside down in a barn, beaten and terrorized; the Down's syndrome child of the midwife is attacked and blinded. There are efforts to chase down the culprit or culprits and at one point the schoolteacher, who narrates the film, speaking long afterward, thinks he has figured it out. But typically for Haneke, as in his widely seen 'Hidden'/'Caché' (2005), it all remains a mystery. If this is a police procedural -- and county police are called in finally to investigate -- it's one that fizzles out. The focus isn't just on criminal acts so much as meanness, such as the protestant minister's harshness toward his own children (whom he torments both physically and psychologically for minor misdeeds); or the farmer's grown son who ruins the baron's cabbage patch during the autumn celebration because he blames the baron for his mother's death in a barn accident, or the doctor's verbal abuse toward his secretary, assistant, and sometime lover. Or even what the baron's wife (Ursina Lardi) says to her husband: 'I can't live in an atmosphere of malice, envy, cruelty and brutality.' For the misfortunes and misdeeds there is much blame, and little forgiveness.There is a slight sense that this is some kind of artful horror movie about evil children, like 'Village of the Damned.' Particularly in the verbal harshness between couples, the film sometimes seems to go a little too far. Haneke doesn't give you a good time. Whether he's speaking of a suicidal family ('The Seventh Continent'), marauding killer youths ('Funny Games'), modern disconnectedness ('Code Unknown'), a sado-masochistic music teacher ('La Pianiste'), a world of lawlessness and chaos ('The Hour of the Wolf'), a paranoid bourgeois couple ('Caché'), there's a kind of severity and grimness about Haneke's world that, if it works for you, becomes tonic, worth the discomfort. But can we bear the thought that there can be so much nastiness in one little village? Can the elders' (and particularly the minister's) relentless morality cause the children to be more than anything filled with malice? This is why the 'Variety' reviewer justifiably says 'The White Ribbon' 'proves a difficult film to entirely embrace.' But the way Haneke complexly weaves his spell and creates his village society out of dozens of little details is difficult not to admire. Reportedly, the German is full of flowery touches that evoke the period. Few films convey so vivid a sense of a late nineteenth-, early twentieth-century world-view and lifestyle.The redeeming vision it that of the schoolteacher (Christian Friedel), a shy, plodding, decent fellow, and Eva (Leonie Benesch) the 17-year-old girl who comes from another town to mind the baron's young twins, who catches the teacher's eye and whom he wants to make his bride -- she too, disarmingly decent and sweet. Haneke is as good at making this couple endearing and touching as he is at making the other adults peevish or indifferent or cruel. And that helps quite a lot. As an older man the schoolteacher is the narrator (Ernst Jacobi), and his humane vision and decent voice provide a perspective on the collective evil that seems to dominate events in this unfortunate year.'The White Ribbon' has an cumulative, episodic structure. One thing happens after another. Things reach a high pitch when the midwife borrows the bicycle the schoolteacher has borrowed, saying she's found out who hurt her son and is going to report it to the police, and then is never seen again. In the end, the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand changes everything, and at the church the town community recognizes that. The narrator explains that he went to war and when he came back moved to another town and never saw the villagers again.Haneke is extraordinarily good at making his little Eichwald come to life, showing its central square in snow and summer and autumn, planting the facades of the baron's mansion as firmly in our minds as the doctor's bourgeois brick pile, showing us rooms packed with children whom a harsh father can banish with a word. He brings the church to vivid life and every face in it seems right. The children stand naturally in their old-fashioned clothes and their homemade nightgowns and in their faces we feel their emotional pain. If the lines are drawn harshly, they're also drawn lovingly. And this is another redeeming feature.Is this the world from which Nazism comes? Not exactly, but 'White Ribbon' shows the ugly element in the German character. But while Germans may read the film that way, it's meant to show fundamental human traits, and in particular -- the pastor is the dominant figure -- how an unrelentingly cruel and judgmental viewpoint can lead to radicalism and violence.Shown at the New York Film Festival 2009. In an article about and appreciation of Haneke in 'The New Yorker,' Anthony Lane describes 'Das weiße Band' as the director's 'most accessible,' and 'best' film; it's definitely his longest (145 minutes) and richest in incident.",9,29,51,7 October 2009
Dreamgirls," Motown sliced too thin
","Dreamgirls is a filmed musical that by reports stays close to its Broadway source. It provides glitzy entertainment, with a tale of intrigue and manipulation and glamorous song performances featuring increasingly chic hairstyles and slimmer singers, as the central black girl song group based on the Supremes loses its more soulful, plumper member, Effie (American Idol's Jennifer Hudson) along with its bad wigs and moves on to superstardom. Behind them is a promoter who himself achieves mega-bucks status and adopts hipper hairstyles, but not without bending a lot of rules and using a lot of people.It may seem unsporting to say so, but this movie, despite its glitter and entertainment value, leaves an empty feeling. There are major questions about how American musical history gets treated here, for the sake of some fairly unexciting original musical numbers. One basic question is, if Effie was the singer who could move you, how did the group become a hit without her, regardless of the promotion? It's obvious Dremagirls refers to Berry Gordy Jr.'s Motown in its focus on impresario Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx). First this Gordy-surrogate hires a soul singer, James 'Thunder' Early, persuading a young black girl group, The Dreamettes, to sing backup for him and pushing out the Dreamettes' sedate manager Marty Madison (Danny Glover). Next Taylor promotes the Dreamettes separately and eliminates Effie. He sells out his used car business to buy payola air time for the group's songs.Gordy pushed Florence Ballard out of The Supremes and made the slimmer more homogenized looking Diana Ross the lead singer. But there's an important element missing from the movie: the charisma and magic of Diana Ross. Her stand-in here, Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles) just can't come close, so the success of the Dreams (as they're re-christened) without Effie remains a mystery.Berry Gordy was involved in payola and he manipulated his groups. But this story is unfair to Gordy, Motown, and black music. It refers to male singers through a composite of James Brown, Little Richard, et al., represented by Jimmy Early (Eddie Muphy), whose performances are uninvolving mimicry and who dies early (get it) of a drug overdose. Motown's greatest star Michael Jackson gets shrunken to ten seconds of a group mimicking the Jackson Five, not even getting the dancing right and seen only on TV. The many other sensational Motown stars beloved of black and white audiences are forgotten, as is the Disco era, since Diana Ross stand-in Knowles is seen as the only Disco diva in Taylor's stable.Subplots like Effie's affair with Taylor and child by him whom he recognizes later, Early's affair with Dreams member Lorell (Anika Nori Rose), and Deena's attempt to star in a movie as Cleopatra, do nothing to make up for how the plot slights black musical history.Jamie Foxx is uneasy and ill cast as the cruel manipulator, Curtis Taylor. This character gets muddled because as the screenplay makes him more and more evil, Foxx seems to be trying harder and harder to make us like him. Maybe he's trying to show Taylor as more three-dimensional, but the character as written is too cardboard thin for that to work.Sure, Motown groups were packaged, and we don't know how many soul singer' souls were destroyed in the process. But Dreamgirls fails to show how huge Motown was for American culture in general and African American culture in particular in the Sixties, Seventies, and Eighties. Gordy's was a big accomplishment, not a narrow con game. What of the 'Motown sound'? There's only one sound here, and it doesn't sound right. The movie makes us long for little clubs with down-dressed performers like Effie as we see her eventually making a partial comeback helped by the faithful Marty Madison. Knowles has one big number, but Hudson soars every time she opens her mouth, even if she can't act. While the big numbers are emotionally empty, the group's composer, Clarance 'C.C.' Brown (Keith Robinson) is moving in his song, 'We'll always be family.' Robinson gives his small role some feeling and intensity.It's hard not to see this as really the story of Effieshe's the only singer we really care about. The audience is electrified by Hudson's farewell song, 'And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going' (though it goes on too long and is poorly directed) and can't wait for her to come back on screen. The elaborate production numbers staged with The Dreams are just flash. But the movie doesn't show that Motown performances, with Diana Ross at the center, could be both glitzy and musically exciting, and these forgettable showtunes don't begin to remind us how often songs out of Motown could stay engraved on our hearts and minds forever.",7,8,17,25 December 2006
Jarhead," Fine study of the meaninglessness of modern warfare
","Sam Mendes' work as a director hasn't lived up to the temporarily high expectations aroused by his first movie, the 1999 American Beauty. With Kevin Spacey in one of his easiest but most successful roles, American Beauty seemed some kind of classic fin de siÃ¨cle statement of middle-class white rebellion. But like a lot of expressions of a moment, it went stale quickly and over the past six years the rose completely lost its bloom. Mendes movie number two, 2002's Road to Perdition, another filmed graphic novel, was full of visual pizazz but flabby in the storytelling department. It makes sense that when Mendes' adapted Anthony Swofford's eponymous novel into the 2005 Jarhead, people had lowered expectations and didn't see much there. Reviews haven't been very favorable.And indeed Jarhead isn't the movie of the year. But it's gotten a bum rap from reviewers who have repeatedly said that it starts out in a derivative and conventional manner and winds up disintegrating into formlessness. It's true the Full Metal Jacket drill scene and the barracks sequences early on are sub-Kubrick and even sub-Black Hawk Down. The latter was a horrifically uncritical recreation of a terrible modern battle sequence but it at least has the virtue of precision. In its early sequences establishing Swofford's training and his unit and their mission, Jarhead wavers between the generic and the specific. Again, Mendes isn't outstanding in the conventional storytelling department. There isn't exceptionally good development of a cast of military characters -- you don't get much beyond Gyllenhaal (the narrator), Sarsgaard (his main sidekick and the boil on the bum of the unit) and Jamie Foxx (the platoon commander, an invincible staff sergeant). Chris Cooper looks too sickly and neurotic to be a brigade leader and cheerleader for the whole endlessly delayed war.There they sit: Operation Desert Shield. The boys at the top have to make some decisions. A hundred thousand and then five hundred thousand men are set down in the sand to sit and hydrate and pee and hydrate and sit some more. They stage combats of desert spiders and they find out their girls have left them for somebody else back home.This passage is not an outstanding performance despite the steely competence of Foxx and Gyllenhaal's seering musclebound youthful intensity -- which are all good to watch, anyway. It really is just waiting, and waiting is something Beckett was good at, but this ain't Godot.But the war finally does come. And what matters is that Jarhead is both a very specific description of a new kind of American warfare, seen at the very lowest level of the grunts on the ground -- high tech war, fought with 'precision' from above, in air strikes so skillful against an enemy so unequal that troops are almost irrelevant -- and something universal but hardly ever so truthfully represented on film: the utter meaninglessness, the sheer insignificance and emptiness of the individual soldier's role in combat.The latter is something often alluded to, but writers and actors and directors always ruin the point by creating heroes or noble sufferers. In Jarhead nobody's a hero. Nobody even gets to fire a shot or kill anybody. After months and months of waiting, their 'war' is four days long. They are sent out into a hellish landscape of sooty burning oil wells, a horizon of endless fire and blackness dotted with frozen cinder corpses out of the Dresden of Vonnegot's Mother Night, torsos and limbs of Arabs the marines lay claim to with selfish madness as 'my Arab,' because their only sense of triumph is the insane one of laying claim to a dead zombie object scattered on a plain. The end of this? Sniper team Sarsgaard and Gyllenhaal get one Arab officer in a tower in their sights and are ready to squeeze the trigger -- and an American officer intervenes to call in an air strike. The boys don't get one single kill -- not even a trigger-squeeze. Dazed and mad and Sarsgaard whining like a baby, they wander over a ridge to find their unit celebrating the end. 'The war's over and you didn't get killed,' Foxx's staff sergeant declares to them.There has never been a better or more hallucinatory depiction of the meaninglessness of war than this. And it's also an accurate view of one angle of Operation Desert Storm. Critics have questioned why the movie isn't more comic or more ironic. What can they be thinking of? How could anything be more hideously comic or more deeply ironic than this? I was never in a war but I was in the US Army, and of all war movies I feel this is supremely my war movie. It must be a lot of other guys' war movie besides mine. The war where the grunts are sent out to kill and find only incinerated corpses is the war of the future. Movies need to show us more black bodies frozen like zombies in the sand, because there are going to be a lot more of them.There's nothing about Gulf War Syndrome. There's nothing about the overall strategies of the war, or the hilarious chaos so brilliantly depicted in David O. Russell's Three Kings -- admittedly a much better, as well as more entertaining, movie than Jarhead. But Three Kings is ironic without really making any profound statement. Jarhead has something universal to say about the powerlessness and insignificance of 95% of all combat soldiers. And it has a very fresh flavor in its final voice-over: we will always be Gulf Warriors. They did nothing; they were geared up and trained for macho hell-raising and mayhem, and they didn't get a single kill. That's because, as Thoreau wrote, 'lo! men have become the tools of their tools.' And when you're the tools of your tools, it's hard to be men any more.",8,5,9,24 December 2006
Control," Rise and fall of a rock legend in evocative black and white
","The first thing that strikes you about 'Control' is its silence, and the chilly beauty of its black and white images. As a still photographer first-time director Anton Corbijn photographed Joy Division in black and white during their short existence. He knows how to get the remorselessly grim feel of the north of England in the late Seventies. (The boys came from the outskirts of Manchester. Joy Division formed in 1976.) This film (there's a documentary just coming out on the band too) is loosely based on a memoir of her marriage by Deborah Curtis, lead singer Ian Curtis' young wife, who had a baby girl by him and then tragically found him after he'd hanged himself in 1980, two months short of his twenty-fourth birthday, just as the band was to tour America for the first time.'Control's' strength is a certain recessiveness. In the English style, it's offhand and avoids huge dramatic crescendos. That's refreshing. And besides the images and the restraint, the film is worth seeing for the concert sequences. The cast actually plays the Joy Division music live, and Sam Riley, who plays Ian Curtis, not only closely resembles him, but is a riveting and intense, almost at times scary, performer. When he says the public doesn't know how much of himself he puts into his performances, we know what he means.The film is excellent at showing Ian's dilemmas. The band is a sudden success. He has an attack in their car as the band returns from a gig. Doctors tell him he has a form of epilepsy. He's given a fistful of pills to take every day and told to have early nights and stay off the booze. How faithfully he takes the pills is unclear but he suffers from their side effects in various ways, while late nights and booze are essentials of his existence. It doesn't seem that the English doctors knew very well how to treat him, and he was so busy performing he didn't take the time to go to specialists and have more extensive tests.Ian had gotten married to Deborah (Samantha Morton) early--too early. On the road he meets a Belgian part-time journalist, Annik Honoré (Alexandra Maria Lara), and they fall uneasily in love. He's not strong enough to decide between the two women. Fear that his disease will only get worse hounds him, and the fits go on. Riley is fascinating to watch as he undergoes an increasingly visible meltdown. Other cast members are cyphers, though Joe Anderson, who has the role of Max in Taymor's Across the Universe, is the lead guitarist. Morton has a drab role but Deborah's unfortunate situation is present as a constant counterpart to Ian's story. The two other important characters are the Manchester music guru Tony Wilson (Craig Parkinson) and the band's wise-guy manager Rob Gretton (Toby Kebbell).The creative inspiration of the band, the nature of their songs, the cast of their lyrics, the reason why Joy Division is a cult band today when it only existed for four years--these are matters the film is unable to elucidate. Watch it for the cool visuals, for the tall, soulful Sam Riley, and for the terrific live performance scenes. Enjoy the understatement, and the silence. Don't expect more.Harvey Weinstein has chosen both for Control and for the soon-to-open Todd Haynes Bob Dylan film I'm Not There to have a slowly-unrolling distribution system, and hopes to bestow early cult status on both films by having them premiere at that temple of cinephilia, Film Forum, in lower Manhattan, New York City, and wait for the buzz of the cognoscenti to multiply and spread. It may work. But both films are tough sells. But A.E. Scott of the NYTimes has said Control is 'enigmatic and moving, much in the manner of Joy Division's best songs.' And that's a good send-off.",8,51,66,12 October 2007
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Supernerd strikes again
","The premise is this: Scott is a 22-year-old bass player in a terrible Toronto band. He falls for a 'dangerously fashionable, roller blading delivery girl' with punk hair called Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), an American transplant who 'starts cruising through his dreams and sailing by him at parties.' He's smitten. His cheery band-groupie high school girlfriend ('and she's Chinese') Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) becomes irrelevant. The cool Ramona likes Scott too. But it turns out he must fight off Ramona's seven 'evil exes.' This iron-clad, if inexplicable, rule is going to shape all the reels to come.The dialogue is witty and smart, especially at first. A lot of cartoonish, video game captions in the air ('Pow,' 'thunk,' etc.) and other devices like scores and labels for new characters increase the feeling that this is a lively and quick-witted movie for and about the video game, texting, Facebook generation. Scott's intro line with Ramona is a silly factoid about the origins of the name Pac-Man, a bit of gaucherie he later denies. Cera has cool, quick delivery and good timing, which also help. So does the presence of Kieran Culkin (also a child star, from a child star family) as Scott's sarky, more mature gay roommate Wallace.Kieran Culkin is aging convincingly. But Cera, what of him? The androgynous, squeaky-voiced Canadian has been acting since he was eleven: he's a pro. Paradoxically, he projects his insecure young men roles with utter ease and confidence: there's got to be an element of the passive-aggressive in this whole nerd-superman concept. Though Cera's character is 22, and seems to have had a string of girlfriends, it's logical that Scott's dating a high school girl. Cera seemed fresh and charming in his first big roles. He can project a wistful, romantic quality that came through nicely in 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist.' Now he seems to be playing roles tailored exclusively for him, like 'Youth in Revolt,based on a not-very-profound series of young adult novels (contrast the tougher, more honest writing of S.E. Hinton that produced a quartet of classic Eighties youth pictures). Youth in Revolt wound up rather limp as a movie -- and began to show Cera's lack of range, which is not disguised by the massive use of loud fast CGI for his duels with ex-boyfriends of his girlfriend here.Actually in 'Scott Pilgrim' Ramona is the character who seems most real. Winstead's speech sounds more sincere and less arch than anybody else's. Her character perhaps is so cool she need not put spin on her words.'They make movies in Toronto?' So goes one of many cute throwaway lines in a movie that before it's burned up its cred brings many smiles, and plenty of full-on laughs too.But then 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World's' fortunes go south. Strangely, this little indie comedy turns into a noisy CGI-ridden feast of pointless violence that makes you want to hold your ears and look at your watch. Why does this happen? One reason is that Edgar Wright, the director, hitherto renowned for the already classic zombie comedy 'Shaun of the Dead' and the charming, energetic cop comedy 'Hot Fuzz,' is English. Both films are deeply rooted in Englishness. If Toronto has a native spirit, Wright isn't tuned in to it. 'Scott Pilgrim' tries to be about so many things and the fault is in the writing. Why should Scott have to battle all these exes to begin with?Scott's forced battles become repetitious. The theme of repetition itself is forced on us. Not only is one of the exes actually twins. Scott himself is doubled at one point, and a movie star ex (occasion for that Toronto joke) turns out to have half a dozen stunt doubles who fight for him while he goes out for coffee. The climactic scene where Scott confronts rock impresario ex Brendan, played by Jason Schwartzman, another actor not aging well, seems heavy-handed. It's run twice, once with Scott's fighting strength empowered by love, the second by his need for self-respect. It's frankly hard to see much difference between these two versions. You may just wanted it to end. But it has to end twice, and the closing credits are very drab.The fight sequences have flashy moments and it's droll to have an androgynous nerd battling Superman (Brandon Routh) and, as the movie star, a champion skateboarder (Lucas Lee). Music for Scott's band, Sex-Bob-Omb, was written by Beck. A lot is going on, and many of the invasive visual tricks work because they speed up the action (all very youth-ADD-text messaging friendly). Nothing here is for slow people. If anything the trouble is not that Wright is a slouch, for he is anything but. It's that he tries too hard. That was true to some extent in 'Hot Fuzz.' And most of the characters introduced at the beginning who contributed to the feeling of being in a real place are thrown away, ceasing to matter, except for brief visual recognition, toward the end.At moments the wintry exteriors of Scott Pilgrim's Toronto and his too-cool, geeky, slightly depressed young friends will bring to mind Terry Zwigoff's 2001 'Ghost World,' also made from a graphic novel, also populated by slackers. Probably 'Scott Pilgrim' could have got by with a measure of its Pow! and Thunk! labels and cyber-world air battles, and still created something of the atmosphere and feel of real young lives as 'Ghost World' quite hauntingly does. But that didn't happen, and all I got was a metaphorical lousy T shirt saying I've seen another Michael Cera movie.",7,6,24,14 August 2010
Quantum of Solace," Both shaken and stirred
","People tend to agree that the 'new' James Bond, Daniel Craig, is awesome--and really new. Ian Fleming's original Bond was 'cruelly handsome.' Craig's got the cruel part, but looks take second place to muscle. He isn't pretty and he isn't stylish except insofar as a man who's lean and hard looks well in a good suit. Though he's brisk and then some--faster than a speeding bullet--he's rather sullen. His face is gnarly, able to regenerate scar tissue with stunning rapidity but little suited to the registering of human emotion. If he strains a bit he can just manage a snarl. Craig is above all a tougher, more pared-down Bond, whose finesse comes not in his skill at seducing a woman or pouring a cocktail but in the capacity to survive any physical challenge. This second Bond film with Craig shows his version can still be fun, and his adventures, amazingly, given all that's been hacked off, still contain some of the glamorous, extravagant feel of the earlier films and of Fleming's silly, superficial, but irresistibly entertaining novels. But the franchise (this is said to be Bond film no. 22) has been updated and reconceived for our times.Not only Bond, but the other trappings of the books and previous films have been rethought. 'M' is now a woman--Judy Dench, solid, crisp, understated, and curiously protective. When others want to derail Bond for killing all the suspects in a case, she sees to it that he's allowed to continue. There are beautiful babes, but not so many and not for so long. There's futuristic gadgetry. But it's more plausible, and less individual. No exploding cigarette lighters or weapon-emitting vehicles with ejection seats; just the high-tech essentials of our day--telephones cued in with computers and data systems. And some excesses: at one point Bond intercepts a dozen bad guys holding a conference call using little nodules in their ears as they sit in the audience of an ultra-modern and plenty-loud production of 'Tosca' in Bregenz, Austria. Bond suggests they try another venue. Indeed they might. But Bond himself makes do with nothing but a pistol and his own indestructible body.Unlike Jason Bourne, 'Quantum's' Bond his no mystery to solve, just a score to settle. There's no self-questioning, just a grudge.Unfortunately, there's no finesse. Yes, Bond has an elaborately prepared cocktail, but it's more complicated than fun, no 'shaken, not stirred' (a formula mocked by Craig's Bond in his first outing). There's no Fleming fascination with chic brand names. Bond dons evening clothes and the good suits--only slightly bulgy from the muscles. He drives a Bondian Astin Martin during the ridiculously violent and rapid chase along the Italian Riviera that opens the movie, but though there may be some pleasure in seeing extremely expensive European sports cars battered and colliding like toy bumper cars, there's no elegance in it. The poor Astin gets its door torn off, and looks a wreck all the way through the scene.Bond himself is like that car. He's thrown about, and in several sequences jumps around on buildings as if practicing the French sport of parkour, which has been defined as 'an activity with the aim of moving from one point to another as efficiently and quickly as possible, using principally the abilities of the human body.' That, in a nutshell, is Daniel Craig as 007. Like Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, his body is his main weapon. Bond's taken away by three MI6 men--or four, I didn't have time to see-- under orders from 'M,' and taken into an elevator. 'M' probably knows this will happen: five seconds after the elevator doors close behind them the would-be guards are all on the floor unconscious, only Bond left standing. We can't even see how he did it; so what? It was inevitable.'Quantum' may offer 'Solace,' but it's short not only on elegance but wit. There's little humor and the bad guys lack Fleming's bizarre flourishes. There's a standard-issue South American dictator waiting to take over again. There's a fake eco-sensitive entrepreneur named Greene (Matthieu Amalric), who will strike a bargain with anybody, just like an actual global arms dealer. He corners the water supply to help the general take over the country: it's all too plausible. True to life too, the statement that the Americans don't matter much any more. True to the film's seriousness, the salt-and-pepper CIA duo, with James Wright as the shrewder of the two, Felix Leiter, who becomes Bond's ally, may seem destined to be buffoons, but they get the straight treatment.You can't see all this as a dumbing down. Fleming's books were clever and entertaining, but hardly what you could call brain twisters. It's a simplification, a toughing up. And a speeding up--the latter adjusted to suit the 21st-century TV generations accustomed to five images a second, to brain-damaging ADD-engendering, Ritalin-requiring, stimulus-hungry young boy's minds. The opening sequence, with its unmotivated, unexplained, pointless, sense-jarring car clashes and spins and falls, is designed just for them, to say: don't worry. We know you're watching, and we're going to give you what you want. But though large parts of the world are growing fatter and softer, athletes have grown tougher and faster, and all spectators know that, so the Sixties Bond now seems effete, and he had to be reconditioned to meet the demands of Extreme Sports and the fantasy quotient of the digital age.Is this a good movie? It's an entertainment, just like all the other Bond pictures, and though we can sigh the lack of the old charm, this lean and mean model holds its own quite well. If only there were more conversation. And if only it would relax a bit more.",7,2,3,16 November 2008
The Butterfly Effect," A riot of plot-morphing
","[s p o i l e r s]
As I walked out a man asked his wife if she'd go home now and destroy her diaries.  I confess the same idea crossed my mind.  That's what Evan Treborn, Ashton Kutcher's character, has to do in The Butterfly Effect to free himself from endless shiftings into mind bendingly awful new plotlines for his life.  By turns he's a glossy frat boy who has great sex with his girlfriend Kayleigh (Amy Smart); in prison for murder and savagely beaten; severely injured in an explosion so he's without hands and in a wheelchair and his best friend - in other places a weirdo creep, here a nice guy with long blond hair - has got his girl -- whose evil brother has become a Christian do-gooder. . .and on and on.  In fact it's much more fun to talk about the ridiculously complicated plotlines of this movie than to watch them actually being played out, because a lot of the time they're nasty or at the very least confusing.Basically The Butterfly Effect is about two things.  Like all tales full of alternative versions, it's about storytelling itself, and, like the 1001 Nights, about the fickleness of fate.  But in the context of the characters involved - who share alternative childhood, adolescent, and college experiences, it's about teenage angst.  The movie plays with young people's basic questions as they ponder lurid, magnified versions of their formative experiences and form equally lurid, magnified answers to queries like: `Who am I?' `Where am I going?' or `What am I going to become?'In this and in its prevailing sense of hyperkinetic doom The Butterfly Effect resembles the new youth cult movie Donnie Darko (2001).  Darko has no journals inducing blackouts that signal moments their eponymous young man can't bear to recall.  Instead it's got a countdown to doom, a scary giant rabbit, a school cult, and a brilliant young man who's slightly deranged - and it's got the talented Jake Gyllenhaal in his juiciest role to date as Donnie, the brilliant young man.Whereas Butterfly Effect, which at moments when the story twists stop being fun may just seem like a movie that's forgotten its plotline, has the appealing young everyman and current flavor of the month, Ashton Kutcher. There's something undeniably sweet and winning about the pretty-faced Ashton, and that's fine, because whatever evil deeds Evan may have done are performed by a child actor (sometimes a pretty foul-mouthed one) as Evan at 7 (Logan Lerman), or a tormented adolescent actor as Evan at 13 (John Patrick Amedori).  Kutcher, the centerfold version of Evan, never even says `damn,' except when he's in prison and he obligingly slips into gutter argot.  He's an innocent victim of a childhood tendency to have blackouts (that's the device that initially introduces all this stuff), and later on of his desire to escape alternative plotlines which may seem good at first but later turn into nightmares, sort of like Dudley Moore (or Brendan Fraser) making wishes in Bedazzled.While Ashton manages the mild transition from an attractively hirsute undergrad whose roommate is a giant, obese punker, to the smooth, pampered frat boy, it's Amy Smart as Kayleigh, his childhood friend and later sometime sweetheart, who gets to do the more challenging shifts from depressed plain Jane in a dead-end waitress job - forever traumatized by the childhood sexual abuses wrecked upon her and her brother and Evan by a drunken, perverted dad (Eric Stolz, having way less fun than in Pulp Fiction); to a scarred, hardened druggie prostitute, to a pretty blond sorority sister - all of this with a lot of help from the makeup and costume departments, of course: but still handling the different turns quite well.There are some very nasty moments when as child and man, Evan gets brutal beatings - not to mention the mutilations; but, as his many fans will be glad to know (if they don't already) Ashton never stops looking pretty (the only reason why he gets the acting jobs, his character boldly declares in Cheaper by the Dozen).  He looks particularly fabulous at the end as a prosperous psychiatrist. He's grown up!  -- Signaled by having his hair slicked back and wearing a nice suit. He always was studying psychiatry in each plotline, even if they sometimes forgot to mention it.  I guess he prepped for his final accreditations by experiencing multiple personality disorder.  A bit beyond the call of duty; but then, this movie goes the extra mile.There's other nasty stuff.  A dog is tied up in a burlap bag and torched in repeated episodes.  A mother and her baby are blown up, though thankfully the results are unseen.  Eric Stolz as the pedophile drunk dad tries to stage a nude sex scene between seven-year-old Evan and his daughter, with her little brother looking on.  But this is the wicked, foulmouthed child Evan, and he'll have none of it (at least in some versions).It's really difficult to summarize this movie and it would be pointless to try.  After a while when things get really dicey for the adult Ashton form of Evan, he grabs one of the composition book diaries he's kept all his life (this is particularly tough when he's in prison, but he manages somehow to get them brought in), looks up some primal, originally blackout-inducing scene, and, reading it, everything goes blurry and starts to shift and shake - and then a new plotline begins.  It's trippy - a little like a Cronenberg movie, especially the wild 1999 eXisTenZ with its virtual-reality game that taps into people's minds.  That's basically what's going on here too.  The somewhat confused premise of the blackouts and the journals aside, it's still fun to watch the alternative versions of Evan's reality being played out successively.  And when he gets a life he can live with, as it were, he burns all the journals and fixes things as they are.  And lives happily every after.  The End.Unlike the haunting and truly angst-ridden - if occasionally confused - Donnie Darko, The Butterfly Effect seems unlikely to achieve cult status. But you never know. Given the current popularity of Ashton Kutcher, it should have a healthy video rental shelf life.  As you can see in Ashton's other efforts, he has a light touch that makes everything seem harmless. In The Butterfly Effect that touch keeps the proceedings from becoming flat-out nauseating.  Kutcher's natural manner is compliance and good naturedness. In Butterfly, he seems like a passive victim, who toughs things out.  He's astonished and not a little upset to wake up with his hands missing, but he can deal with it - till he escapes from it.  My Boss's Daughter, a hilarious but tasteless comedy in the post-Farrelly brothers mode of deliberately crude humor, which Kutcher produced as well as starred in, is more typical of the Ashton Kutcher touch. Ashton isn't really so much a comic as just a lighthearted guy who's also pleasant to look at.  Not capable of occasional drollness like Josh Hartnett, he's more a straight man than really funny himself:  his presence allows funniness to happen around him, as it abundantly does in Boss's Daughter.  After you've watched Dude, Where's My Car?, Just Married, and My Boss's Daughter, you realize that Butterfly Effect really is a big stretch for him.  But it's in the nature of a good movie actor to be able to appear in all sorts of situations. It's interesting to speculate whether an amazing director like P.T. Anderson could morph the Ashton syndrome into something subtler and more troubling, as Anderson did brilliantly with Adam Sandler in Punch Drunk Love.",Null,0,3,12 February 2004
No Country for Old Men," Grim reaper in a Dutchboy bob
","Cormac McCarthy's characteristically dry, laconic, and sometimes hilarious dialogue brightens the scenes of this superb and chilling thriller the Coen brothers have ably transferred to the screen with excellent help from Javier Bardem, Tommy Lee Tones, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, and others, including a salty second layer of minor characters who look like they sprang straight out of the sandy soil of West Texas.McCarthy, unmistakably one of America's greatest living writers of fiction, lives vividly in this, the Coens' first literary adaptation. Some of his best novels, notably Blood Meridian (called by Yale critic Harold Bloom one of the 20th century's greatest novels), are so apocalyptic, so embedded in their glorious poetic prose, as to be virtually unfilmable. All the Pretty Horses, from his Border Trilogy, has been filmed with some success (Matt Damon works in his role; Penelope Cruz doesn't). No Country for Old Men is late McCarthy. Post-apocalyptic, maybe. Jones's disenchanted, aging sheriff says, 'When you don't hear sir and ma'am any more pretty much everything else goes.' Llewelyn Moss (Brolin), a fairly innocent but opportunistic man, is deer hunting (he's not a good shot; he can't catch one out of a whole herd of them) when he finds a sprawl of wrecked vehicles and corpses, including Mexicans and a dog. There's a truckload of heroin in plastic packages and a briefcase containing two million plus in $100 bills. Moss takes the money and hightails it in his truck.Naturally there are people who want the money back. Not nice people.The man they hire to go after it is called Anton Chigurh. Expertly played by Javier Bardem, he's a villain--but with a clear-cut morality all his own--who's invincible and probably unforgettable. Chigurh is like the Grim Reaper: he can decide your fate with the flip of a coin; he reflects the biblical side of Cormac McCarthy, but in a terrible modern corruption. The crooks also hire another hit man, Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson)--a mistake, because Chigurh resents the duplication. He is the last word, the anti-Christ. No man may come after him.Out in these open spaces of West Texas--El Paso, the Mexican border--where Cormac McCarthy's innocent, pure-hearted cowboys used to roam in earlier decades, things have changed beyond recognition. This is 1977. It's a decade and a half since Vietnam. Lots of drugs and lots of money floating around; you don't hear sir and ma'am any more.The story turns into a chase, Chgurh after Llewelyn Moss, the sheriff coming after them. And then Carson Wells, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, and doomed, pops in to follow.People have been talking about Bardem's pageboy haircut. Yes, it's creepy. Bardem makes Chigurh both threatening and inscrutable. It seems he'd as soon kill you as look at you. He has a long rifle with a silencer and a high-pressure cattle-killer device with a tank that looks like something a person with emphysema would carry around. It kills instantly with a pop in the head. He also uses it to shoot out door locks.The film is more tense and suspenseful in the first half or so than in the grimly determined finale (all true to the book, if with a few details cut). By that time a lot of people have been killed and some wounded. This has some elements of the Coen's 'Fargo' and 'Blood Simple' (the latter introduced in an earlier NYFF) and thus with their most powerful work. But 'No Country' is an economical and faithful literary adaptation. Some Coen movies have been thin and frivolous lately. This is emphatically not, sure and riveting from the first few shots. Richard Deakins' photography, making much appropriate use of wide-angle lenses, is superb. Their distinguished source seems to have kept the Coens honest and serious (except for the dry humor built into McCarthy's talk). Unquestionably this will wind up being one of the best American films of the year. It's tight and vivid and suspenseful. It's great stuff. The images sing and stun. There's no distracting music, only the beauty and terror of real sounds.Present for the NYFF press screening Q&A (moderator Lisa Schwartzbaum): Brolin, Jones, Macdonald, Bardem, and the brothers Coen, Ethan and Joel.",10,66,130,7 October 2007
District 9," Cat food for the 'prawns' and caviar to the general
","How odd to set a sci-fi horror movie in and around Johannesburg, South Africa. That's where a big fuzzy looking space ship has been hovering in the air for twenty years, we're told during the mocumentary footage at the outset of Neill Blomkamp's 'District 9' explaining how a gang of terminator-torso creatures would up here by accident, starving, and were settled in a compound on the edge of the city called District 9 that's become a hideous slum. District 9 is now a place despised by all South Africans, black and white. The unfortunate outer space refugees confined there, whose insect-reptilian look and proclivity for feeding on rubbish, bad meat, and cat food has led to their being called 'prawns' by the general, are to be relocated to a tent camp 200 miles out by a wealthy independent contractor called MNU (Multi-National United).By the time all this has been laid out for us, of course, it's obvious Johannesburg isn't so 'odd' as a setting for the story at all, just heavy-handed. The location chosen by South African director Blomkamp is a blatant way of making this a sort of allegory about man's inhumanity to those he considers his inferiors, like the blacks in the Bantustans of apartheid South Africa. The only trouble is, the film thus begins with a creakily obvious story device.Another trouble with this unholy combination of bits from 'Black Hawk Down,' 'RoboCop,' 'Transformers,' 'Aliens,' 'The Fly,' etc., etc, is that it points to how aliens are being cruelly treated and then presents them as disgusting. Some pleasure comes out of how that disgust is milked, however, because the interiors of the 'prawns'' shacks, a riot of technology and degraded junk, show the designers had a lot of fun with them, as they do with the exteriors of the shantytown, a kind of sci-fi Mogadishu (actually, in the Ridley Scott's film, recreated in the suburbs of Rabat, Morocco). Even when it descends into actioner schlock, District 9 does make ingenious use of its low budget and limited locations. And even if its characters are mostly clichés, the degenerating relationships in the protagonist's life are poignant enough.'District 9' is a conversion story, because Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), the goofy bureaucrat put in charge of the relocation, who's the son-in-law of MNU's owner, starts out with contempt for the aliens but ends up being, sort of, their ally. More than that. When invading the house of one of them, he spills some black fluid from a vial onto his face and starts sprouting a 'prawn' claw where his left hand used to be. Then, the whites want to use him to kill aliens, because his new DNA allows him to fire alien weapons that are the only thing that can finish them off. And a Nigerian gangster, who preys off the aliens, stockpiling their special weaponry and extorting enormous sums from them for tinned cat food, wants to consume Wikus' arm because he thinks it will make him superhuman. Anyway, Wikus is forced to befriend the 'prawn' whose shack contained the fluid, because he (or it) may be able to help him. And so he who was to have been the aliens' concentration camp director now becomes their protector.But if the 'prawns' are vulnerable only to their own weapons which only they can fire, it seems easy enough to hurt them in other ways. This movie just isn't very well thought out. There's no further back story for the aliens either. Where do they get money? What do they do all day? These things we never learn. Nor, unlike the flawed but superior 'Children of Men,' are local events put in the context of global ones.Copley is (perhaps intentionally?) a wooden actor when he first appears being 'filmed' at his desk as publicity for the eviction and relocation project. He livens up when he gets involved in the violent action in the 'prawns'' ghetto. For a while, he seems a complex hero, morphing from doofus into bigot, then pariah, then cross-over, then selfless savior. But during this interesting progress the movie unfortunately descends just as rapidly from its allegorical sci-fi setup into more and more crude levels of B-picture action and horror.And this crudity only reminds us of how clumsy the fake TV news, surveillance footage, documentary interviews with academics or technicians and other bits of hack 'realism' have been, and highlights how crudely drawn the MNU operatives and Wikus' family members are. And how utterly derivative the aliens' body shapes are. And how inexplicable it is that the 'prawns' speak in the usual sci-fi movie guttural backwards-tape alien language, which is subtitled for us, but the white men all understand it, and the aliens all understand English. By the time you get to the end of District 9, however intense its sometimes George Romero-worthy yuck scenes have been along the way, it has just become an utter, irredeemable mess. And that's too bad because there are some ingenious ideas buried here, and the first half lets you think instead of just watch people and critters bang into each other.The final insult is to find that this movie is being heralded as 'original' and 'smart.' Only mavericks like Armond White and Michael Sragow are unimpressed. (To liven things up, Ebert even supported White's right to pan this -- then withdrew his support.) Sragow points to the film's 'derivative' quality. A black man himself, White points to how 'District 9' trivializes the South African liberation struggle, and is offensive to Nigerians. But viewers and critics see the movie they want to see, and since this one pushes the right liberal buttons and gives the superficial appearance of being an 'original' sci-fi movie, it's making a big noise and doing good box office.",6,8,26,14 August 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Overblown, overlong; great role for Casey Affleck
","New Zealander Andrew Dominik's 'Chopper'(2000) had Eric Bana very effective in the biopic of a famous Australian criminal. This overblown, overlong, pseudo-arty rehash (with intermittent fake-antique 'refracted' camera-work) of Jesse James's last days has been admired and hated. Brad Pitt got the Venice Film Festival's Best Actor award. In fact Pitt lacks the presence needed here to make his role interesting. Casey Affleck, with his embarrassing faux-naïve eagerness, is the one who holds the screen. With this and the upcoming movie brother Ben has debut-directed with him as the star ('Gone, Baby, Gone' from a novel by 'Mystic River' author Denis Lehane), he may be moving up to major roles, so that's the most noteworthy thing abut this otherwise misfired effort. Sam Rockwell, Sam Shepherd and others are wasted in scenes and conversations that ramble on and never make much sense. The Seventies-style quirkiness isn't backed up by solid ideas, and at over two and a half hours, this is a long, tedious slog to sit through.",7,9,20,30 September 2007
Twilight," Varieties of vampire experience
","Say you're feeling like a misfit in school; how about finding a vampire to be your boyfriend or girlfriend? Vampires, after all, are misfits too--big time--but their alienation is offset by special powers you lack, such as superhuman strength and the ability to live for centuries. A friend like that sets you apart from the crowd. The rich possibilities of teenage vampire romance are illustrated by two new movies, 'Twilight' and 'Let the Right One In.' Different as they are, they satisfy similar adolescent fantasies. Maybe for different adolescents.'Twilight,' directed by Catherine Hardwicke, of 'Thirteen' and 'Lords of Dogtown,' is a story primarily for teenage girls. It's based on the first of Stephanie Meyer's bestsellers about the relationship that develops at a Washington State high school between a new girl in the junior class named Bella (Kristen Stewart) and, as the high girls unnecessarily spell it out to Bella, 'totally gorgeous' undead teenager Edward Cullen. He's a student; so are several of his siblings. Of course the other students don't know the Cullens are vampires; it is left to Bella make the discovery after she and Edward fall for each other. Young female readers of the books have been suggesting their various 'perfect' candidates to play the role of this heartthrob (see YouTube)--Hayden Christensen, Gaspard Uliiel and Josh Hartnett were favorites--but the choice for the movie has fallen on Robert Pattinson. Meyer has published three sequels, so if the movie opener does well this could be a franchise on the order of Harry Potter.'Twilight' glamorizes and softens vampire-hood and makes it upper middle class. Edward's foster father's the Washington State town's main doctor. The family drives cool late-model cars and lives in a splendid airy pad up in the misty hills. None of the old lugubrious Addams Family heavy-curtained look. The Cullens are hip, PC vampires. When Edward tells Bella about himself, he explains they're 'like vegetarians,' abstaining (though with difficulty) from human blood and living instead off deer from the woods. They like the Pacific Northwest because of all the rain--the perpetual 'twilight'--but it's not because sunshine will make them burst into flames, only that it makes them glow with a diamond-like digitalized surface on their skin that will reveal them to be 'different.' Edward shows Bella when they're up in the woods. Their relationship is chaste--perhaps to avoid the danger of Edward's inadvertently pouncing on Bella and biting her neck. They don't even kiss on the mouth till the end. Edward's concerned because he doesn't want to get involved with Bella--it could cause them both a world of harm (like premarital intercourse?).The prim, nobly suffering Edward is like a superhero, a pale, romantically high-cheek-boned version of a blockbuster cliché. He can jump across a parking lot to stop a skidding SUV from injuring Bella. In one of the movie's most whimsical sequences, he takes Bella flying up in the trees near his family's house to admire the river and the mist. Trouble comes when it turns a rival vampire family of the old-fashioned homicidal kind has invaded the region.Bella has all kinds of conflicts--and Kristen Stewart is reasonably good at making them seem real. She's left her remarried mother in Arizona and gone back to live with dad, Forks, WA's lonely, rather boring town sheriff. Her regular human classmates are that he is, doesn't want Bella to get involved with him. But in a cliff-hanger at the film's end, she begs him to 'turn' her, and he refuses--at the high school prom! This is glossy, somehow conventional and kitschy stuff, with clunky characterization and some blatant makeup. Why the Cullens need to play baseball (at superhuman speed) in a thunderstorm is never explained. And the fudging on classic rules of vampire-hood seems unjustified. Pattinson's wooden acting--no better than Christensen or Hartnett's would have been--is only compensated by many tight closeups of his immaculate and chiseled face. Nonetheless Twilight is still lively and fun, and not at all bad, really; Hardwicke has a good touch with young people. This is what the squealing girls wanted: a glamorization and gentrification of vampires into a boyfriend who's noble and 'different' and cool and scary. The 'Twilight' stories are an interesting pop phenomenon that it's no use fighting.Swedish indie director Tomas Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In' is at the opposite pole. It's dark and down-and-dirty and surprisingly realistic--and at the same time more authentically strange. The supernatural effects are simple and understated. One vampire, a newly-turned who doesn't at all like who she's become, commits suicide by having her husband open the shade and let the sun in: she explodes into flames and is burnt away. Alfredson doesn't mess with or tone down the harsh rules of vampire life.'Let the Right One In' is Swedish, after all--from a country that's all twilight. This is a complex, ironic tale of a small blond 12-year-old boy names Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) living in the outskirts of Stockholm who gets cruelly picked on by classmates and fantasizes revenge, standing in his room fondling a small dagger, as we first see him. Soon he's befriended by a mysterious new neighbor, Eli (Lina Leandersson), a lanky-haired girl who hangs around outdoors in the cold without needing a coat. She likes him, and he asks her to be his girlfriend. Over time, he realizes she's a vampire, but he doesn't care. There's nothing glamorous about Eli's life. When Oskar sees her flat, he says, 'You're like poor, right?' Her dad is a loser and knows it. His efforts to kill people and get their blood are practical and utilitarian, but also fumbled failures. She may be able to help Oskar--and she does, both physically, at a crucial moment, and psychologically, by encouraging him to fight back. But she herself is doomed. No sequels planned.",7,3,10,22 November 2008
Blue Crush," Authentic surf girls in ordinary picture.
","The best and truest thing about `Blue Crush' is that the Hawaii surf girls in it are working class girls.  They're not just pretty girls off on a spree, much less middle class boys with endless amounts of time to pursue the perfect wave in the endless summer.  They have to clean up gross, trashed suites inhabited by pro football players in a luxury hotel on Oahu and take care of their wayward little sisters because their mom has run off, and they have to grab extra minutes to train in the small hours.All the scenes that illustrate this working class aspect of Anne Marie and Eden and Lena and Kala's and Anne Marie's little sister Penny's life are fresh.The movie also delineates the difference between haoles and locals:  it shows Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis II), Anne Marie's pro footballer temporary boyfriend, getting a beating when she takes him surfing on locals' wave turf, which is something that happens in real life.  A haole can get killed for that.  Sanoe Lake (with a Hawaiian surf champion mother) and Mika Boorem and Kala Alexander are pretty close to what they're supposed to be and they play really well and naturally together.  The scenes between them are fun, whether working at the hotel, or on the beach or at their hutch.  Michelle Rodriguez (of `Girlfight') is girl no. 2, Anne Marie's goad and coach, some would say a stronger, more charismatic person than Kate Bosworth. Rodriguez's relentless feistiness can be grating, but still it's easy to believe that she ought to be in the Pipeline competition along with Anne Marie and she has an impressive dignity, not to mention beauty, about the way she holds herself.The subject of class is further developed by showing a little bit more about the pro footballers the girls run into at the hotel.  Matt Davis as the quarterback boyfriend has hunk charisma and a sweet face, a mean combination.  Good casting isn't quite enough to make this a great movie, though.  It has social awareness and authentic atmosphere, but all the nice surfer bods and the hairiest Pipeline waves can't make `Blue Crush' different from an average surfer movie climaxing in a competition.The best surfing action adventure fiction movie is the 1991 `Point Break,' which was made by a woman, Kathryn Bigalow (whose `Near Dark' is another classic in another underdog genre, the vampire movie).  `Point Break' gets away from the clichÃ© of competition and gets deeper into surfing's mystique than any of the documentaries.  Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and his pals are surfing gurus and romantic outlaws so charismatic that the cop (a strong, wide awake Keanu Reeves) lets Bodhi surf to his doom rather than have to face jail.  Every one of Bodhi's crew is sharply individualized - always a good sign.  Surfers don't just chase the perfect wave and get inside a tube; they seek Nirvana and they vanquish their inner demons or die trying, and death is no idle threat in this sport.  `Point Break' gets at all that and takes us on a wild ride full of surprises.  It's arguably the most original and best action movie of the Nineties.  And naturally the surf photography in `Point Break' is as grand and as beautiful as any on film: it focuses on the huge openness of the sea and doesn't get too hung up on waves. This movie is about boldness.  The scenes of the girl teaching a cocky, athletic guy to surf are the same thing `Blue Crush' tries to do - much less memorably.The girls in `Blue Crush' talk a lot about big balls, and they don't mean beach balls.  But there's precious little about the mystique of surfing in the movie, and no moments that strongly capture what it's like to go out there and meet the challenge. Why does Anne Marie, who's the movie's heroine after all, wimp out so much?  Well, because she nearly drowned in an earlier competition.  But we don't really so much see her conquer her fear and live 24/7 the life of an adrenalin junky (a given of all the surfing life in `Point Break') as get pushed to a good performance and a pro contract by the encouragement of a more seasoned fellow competitor from Australia, real life woman surf champion Kate Skarrett.  There are other great women surfers who appear in the movie and they've got the balls they're talking about, no question about it.  But they wind up being the usual window dressing.The affair with the quarterback is left dangling. `Blue Crush' is good fun, and it's an appealing introduction to the too much overshadowed world of women's surfing, but it hasn't much of a payoff or a truly interesting plot, and the surfing sequences have been accused of too much digitalizing. Another example of a sports movie with women that goes deeper (way deeper) into interesting plot territory while handling its athletic world (track) with exceptional integrity is `Personal Best' (which some think Mariel Hemingway's one essential performance) - but then that was written and directed by Robert Towne (of 'Chinatown'), who's about as good a writer as Hollywood's got.  John Stockwell, who directed this one, has had a somewhat checkered career as actor and writer (he wrote the screenplay for `Rock Star,' which starred Mark Wahlberg, and he's just directed `Crazy/Beautiful' with Kirsten Dunst), isn't on the level of Towne and Bigelow.",Null,0,1,8 September 2002
Before Sunset," Suave sequel: a new genre is born
","'Before Sunset' is one of those movies that look superficial, romantic, weepy, crowd-pleasing, but really is original, smart, analytical, and challenging. It stands by itself but is richer seen in relation to 'Before Sunrise,' made nine years earlier, of which it is the sequel, and besides that it's richer and subtler than the original. The characters and the actors are older, more experienced and more sophisticated. It's got a documentary element, reminiscent of Michael Apted's wonderful '7 Up,' '14 Up,' series. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, who also stared in 'Before Sunrise,' don't have to pretend to be nine years older in this sequel; they are. They're only thirty-three now, but Hawke has the ravaged gauntness his breakup with Uma Thurman seems to have imposed on him. Delpy is more mature, less angelic, more businesslike, but still beautiful. 'Before Sunset' is a leaner film than 'Before Sunrise.' It's real-time, and without frills. Venues or backgrounds are simpler. Jesse and Céline largely just walk and talk. Hawke and Delpy are more accomplished actors; less self-conscious people. The talk flows more effortlessly. The continuity of the scenes is a seamless tour de fource almost as if this were all a single take like Sokorov's 'Russian Ark.' There isn't flirting or a developing attraction, a growing physical intimacy, as in 'Before Sunset,' because Jesse and Céline spend most of the film talking about that earlier meeting and how it has haunted them and dominated their lives. Gradually it comes out (particularly during the car ride that leads to where Céline lives) that her current relationship is limited and his marriage is largely sexless, redeemed only by his adoration of his four-year-old son. She pretends not to remember that they made love that night in Vienna nine years before. Maybe that means their sudden passion never really was consummated, because their affinity wasn't something one night's sex could fulfill. The premise is this: Jesse has published a novel that's a bestseller in the US and he's doing a signing in Paris. (Hawke's real life identity fits here, since he's published several books.) Suddenly as he's coming to the end of his talk, Céline appears outside the window of the bookstore (which is one every American in Paris knows: Shakespeare & Company). He's supposed to go to the airport in a couple of hours, but his bags are packed and a car is ready, and he and Céline agree to go and talk. She leads him to a café called Le Pure. (This is real time, but not real space: the places where they go are far apart.) Then they take a boat ride on the Seine; finally they get in the car and wind up at Céline's apartment which turns out to be a lovely enclave where her neighbors are together outside having a party.A movie in real time consisting mostly of conversation is impossible to summarize: it would take twenty pages. But it does emerge that both still think about each other a lot; that meeting nine years before has remained important. The flame still burns bright. Jesse did go back to Vienna six months later in the station to meet Céline as they'd promised, but her grandmother was buried on that day and she couldn't be there. Later he says that perhaps his dream of romantic love was shattered forever by her failure to appear. They rue the fact that they didn't exchange addresses or phone numbers. There's little touching or kissing but there doesn't have to be. It's obvious that this is a climactic reunion for both of them and the attraction is as strong as ever, probably stronger  except that there are obstacles. They're not young and free any more. They have lives, commitments, involvements. . . What will happen? As the film ends, its obvious Jessie is quite happily going to miss his plane. But while Linklater & Company keep us guessing, the partial answer that comes is quite charming. 'Before Sunset' is a superb sequel. It's touching but surprisingly unsentimental. And it's as graceful a piece of film-making as you could ever see, with the gracefulness of art that conceals artifice. Richard Linklater is one of the most interesting younger American directors. His work is authentic and personal, but has real range, from the slacker movies through the romantic encounters of Delpy and Hawke and the tight theatrical drama 'Tape' to the inspired philosophical musings and fresh use of animation of 'Waking Life,' and Hawke has been involved in four of Linklater's movies. Linklater and Hawke are soulmates and brothers, and Delpy is the other essential collaborator in the 'Sunset'/'Sunrise' sequence, because she too is a writer and wrote her own dialogue and the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is too obvious to mention. It's obvious also the audience would like another sequel, and so would the actors. It's only a question of when. The inventive Richard Linklater has created a new genre: the real time sequel.",Null,97,112,30 July 2004
The Chorus," Caged birds sing
","There's an air of romance surrounding wayward boys, particularly in the French tradition, where they tend to be poetic as well as mischievous. In 'The Chorus,' Christophe Barratier draws on this tradition and adds some lovely vocal sounds. 'The Chorus' is about an 'internat' or reform school where a new principal who writes music tames his young charges, some naughty, some just abandoned, by teaching them to sing in a boys' chorus. The school director, Rachin (sounds like Nurse Ratched), François Berléand (of Jacquot's 'The School of Flesh'), is a prissy sadist who preaches a philosophy of instant punishment for all real or imagined wrongdoing ('action-reaction'); but when the new principal, Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot) shows up with a soft approach to his classes and his supervisory duties, he finds allies among the faculty and staff.'The Chorus' advances the frequently screened theory that delinquent kids are better charmed than chastened; that if you can find a positive activity they excel in, the misbehavior will die out.Barratier has had good success with his young actors. The most important boy is the 'tête d'ange' (head of an angel), tall, fair-haired Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier), who's often in trouble and refuses to join the choir, till Mathieu catches him singing by himself and discovers his star soloist. Morhange's voice possesses not only a rich natural musicality but the haunting purity only boy sopranos have. Morhange has the most attractive mother, and Mathieu's success in encouraging the boy's singing makes the pudgy, bald man fantasize romance with her -- thus incidentally clearing himself of the suspicion of pedophilia that tends to haunt any all-boys school setting. Mathieu's romantic dream is futile, and he humbly fades away at the story's end, like some Gallic pied piper of boy soprano-dom.'The Chorus' takes place in post-war France and its topic and look establish immediate links with a bevy of seminal French films. Wayward French boys turn up in boarding schools that are places of both repression and refuge, as you can see in Jean Vigo's school revolution in 'Zero for Conduct' (1933). The beloved textbook of the French bad-boy tradition is Alain-Fournier's 'Le Grand Meaulnes' (The Wanderer), which was notably filmed by Jean-Pierre Albicocco in 1967. The tradition becomes more autobiographical in Truffaut's 1959 400 Blows, which introduced the director's alter ego, Jean-Pierre Léaud; and in Malle's moving and long-contemplated memoir of a boarding school in wartime, 'Au Revoir les Enfants' (1987). Jean Cocteau mythologized a bad-boy idol who haunted him all his life in the Dargélos of 'Les Enfants Terribles' (1950), made into yet another classic film by Jean-Pierre Melville. This whole idea has remaining traces in the feral youth Gaspard Ulliel plays in André Téchiné's recent 'Strayed.' 'The Chorus,' it is true, is a relatively conventional entry; except for adding music, it rides upon, rather than transcends, the tradition. But it's a warm story with much charm and little pretension.Barratier himself is a talented musician who, like Mathieu, has drifted into other things. A trained classical guitarist, he won several international competitions after studying at the prestigious École Normale de Musique in Paris, and played professionally for several years. But in 1991 he joined Galatée films to train under his uncle, the renowned actor, producer and writer Jacques Perrin -- who bookends 'The Chorus' as a Morhange who has grown up into a famous classical conductor. For the next decade Barratier was an associate producer and collaborated with Perrin on 'Children of Lumière,' 'Microcosmos,' 'Himalaya' and 'Winged Migration.' Now he has turned his hand to fiction and directed his own film, with success. There is a risk of preciosity and sweetness, mostly avoided by the dryness of both Mathieu and Rachin as characters, as well as the surviving wickedness of the boys, especially an arch bad-boy, Mondain (Grégory Gatignol). The point of view is Mathieu's and the mature Morhange's, so the film doesn't go as deep into the boys' psyches as it goes into their voice boxes.The director is well connected. He's the son of film actress Eva Simonet and besides his uncle his grandparents were also theater people. The Chorus was top box office in France after its release in March 2004. The French critical reception was pretty mixed, and the film's been reviled by some in the United States as (in one writer's words) 'unbelievably inane, saccharine, and derivative'; 'all smooth, nutrient-free clichés.' Even thumbs-up king Roger Ebert didn't like it: 'this feels more like a Hollywood wannabe than a French film,' he wrote. 'Where's the quirkiness, the nuance, the deeper levels?' But it's really a cleanly made, simple, humanistic, and satisfying little film with far less pandering than its critics claim, and whether we like it or not, it's the French Best Foreign Oscar entry, and the little chorus is likely to perform ' Vois sur ton chemin' on Awards night (if their voices haven't changed). The relatively minimal mise-en-scène and the period setting link it more with its classic film antecedents than with the overproduced 'Very Long Engagement' (Jeunet's film's Oscar nominations are for décor and photography). Derivative and conventionally themed? Yes. Barratier has acknowledged 'The Chorus's' inspiration in an earlier film, 'La Cage aux Rossignols' (The Nightingales' Cage, 1945), which has the same premise -- and anyone can name a long list of movies about teachers who charm their wayward flock. None of them feels -- or sounds -- quite like this movie, though. And the boys do their own singing: the 'tête d'ange' really has the 'voix d'ange.' American reviewers, missing the nuances, plug Les Choristes into 'Mr. Holland's Opus' or 'Dead Poets Society' and find it stereotypically schmaltzy. The gentler French critics don't see those crude comparisons and are able to call it 'un beau film' and find in it a satisfying example of 'cinéma populaire.' We can too if we open up to it.",Null,112,128,23 February 2005
The Pianist," A terrible and beautiful experience
","Roman Polanski's `The Pianist,' winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes, has less in common with Spielberg's `Schindler's List' than with Kozinski's `The Painted Bird':  it's about a Jew who survived in the midst of the Holocaust and who, somewhat like Polanski himself, slipped by the Nazis throughout the war.  Instead of being a child like Kozinski's hero (or Polanski during the war) Wladyslaw Szpilman (Vladek) is an artist, but he has very much the same detachment as a wanton child.  Stripped of his whole family when he's snatched apart as they're herded off to the death camps, he becomes a solitary creature living on in Warsaw by his wits and with help from others. He's stripped down again and again, left with little more than a toothbrush and a piece of bread, but he keeps some other baggage no one can take away: he always remains also a musician with a mission in life, to play piano on Polish radio.  This we have seen Szpilman doing as the war breaks out and we see him doing again after it's over.  Polanski's task, achieved with impressive completeness mixed with superb restraint, is to show us all that happens in between.  This is a singular tale about a man reduced to the commonest denominator of bare existence, but it's also a vision of the survival of the human spirit. That survival is vividly expressed when we see Szpilman play air piano hidden in a locked apartment overlooking the Warsaw ghetto, and when we hear him, starving, bearded and gaunt, playing a Chopin Nocturne for a German officer who finds him hiding and then chooses to protect him.  All through this surreal adventure, which is full of horrors and rather coldly inflicts enormous emotional pain upon any sensitive person who watches it, Szpilman, played with equal absorption and panache by Adrien Brody, seems to slide along like an elegant wraith, noble but also self effacing.  (This is the great role that Brody was destined for and has been robbed of up to now.) 
`After great pain a formal feeling comes,' as Emily Dickenson puts it, and `The Pianist' has a coolness and restraint other holocaust movies have lacked. This doesn't mean we're spared horror, fear, and terrible sorrow. It simply means we watch with a kind of hunger and awe.  And we respect what we see because it is without theatricality or schmaltz.Brody carries the film, and it's the nature of the story that all other characters are in a sense cameos.  Though some secondary characters are strong ones, others are too little distinguished to keep them separate. Another flaw, inevitable perhaps, is that this is a movie where all the Poles speak English.  It helps a bit that the Germans all speak German, and it helps a lot that the Warsaw Forties war world is so faithfully recreated---sometimes unaccountably beautiful in its cold light and faded colors.  It's obvious that `The Pianist' works better than `Schindler's List' to recreate the Holocaust experience, simply because it focuses on one man.  And it helps that, though the experience was different, Polanski was there, in Krakow anyway, surviving and hiding through the war, escaped from the ghetto, as Szpilman did.Now that he has produced something really splendid, people feel obliged to point out that Polanski is a sex offender, exiled from the US because he won't face charges for it.  Well, what can one say?  He appears before us in `The Pianist' not as a criminal but as an artist with authentic knowledge of profound suffering.  The experience this movie provides is a terrible and beautiful one, and there's not a wrong note in it.",Null,0,0,8 January 2003
Seabiscuit," Triumphant conventionality
","Roger Ebert says he has a theory that `people more readily cry at movies not because of sadness, but because of goodness and courage.'This is certainly a reason why Gary Ross's Seabiscuit tugs so effectively at the heartstrings. But the main one is the way the movie shows the triumph of the underdog spread fourfold among three men and a horse. And again the timing is right in the American release. Just as Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later was delightful because it was a low budget movie that could compete with a lot of loud and dubious blockbusters, Seabiscuit earns our gratitude by being a blockbuster without explosions or exhibitionism, an epic of restraint, modesty and -- yes -- `goodness and courage.' The loudest sound you hear is the starting bell for the races. There are those of us, mainstream folk, who've been starving for such fare. I saw people in the audience in the early matinee who plainly were alive in 1929 and 1938, and they wept and applauded throughout with awe and gratitude. We shall see how the younger generations respond.An enthusiastic response is justified. There is nothing in Seabiscuit that's very original; it awakens involuntary flashbacks to many traditional Rocky-esque sports biopics as one watches. But Gray and his chief collaborators, the talented author Lauren Hillenbrand and the splendid cast headed by Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, and co-producer Tobey McGuire, have nonetheless provided us with a quite wonderful movie, as much for its surefire writing and brilliant editing as for any of the acting.Everyone must agree that the three men behind the most famous horse of his time are played by three of the best actors Hollywood now has to offer. Critics are in accord in saying Cooper's performance is the subtlest and the most real: he models the principle that Less is More. Tobey McGuire isn't given quite enough to do; his greatest accomplishment may be his lean look; he's barely recognizable, and as a former redhead myself I don't think the dye job is as bad as some have claimed. Bridges is, in his way, magnificent, but glossily iconic and therefore somewhat opaque. His resemblance to Franklin D. Roosevelt is pushed a bit too hard, as is the whole uplifting populist message - the `we didn't fix the horse. He fixed us - and we fixed each other,' and `sometimes all somebody needs is a second chance,' stuff. (It's pretty corny. But within the context of this beautifully made movie that believes in itself, we buy it.)It's important, anyway - if young people do come to see Seabiscuit - for them to get the simplified, but nonetheless just portrait of the times provided with authentic stills and footage, and the voiceover narration by iconic historian David ('The Civil War') McCullough. The travelogue of the Depression and Prohibition years includes a quiet but heartfelt plug for FDR and that, too, is moving, especially in today's post-Yuppie mood of numbingly exploitive jingoism.Indeed each of the three actors gives a powerfully understated performance - they're like thoroughbreds who're never given their head - whose litotes (a word schoolboys learned back then) enhances the movie's epic quality by never letting us forget that their triumphs were snatched from deprivation and adversity.The long time devoted to the three men's backgrounds early in the movie isn't ill spent. It establishes the leisurely pace that is the essence of epic. But these back-stories aren't as necessary as the filmmakers may have thought. And despite the slow movement, there isn't deep detail. There's barely one scene to establish Red Pollard's (McGuire's) literate, close-knit family before he's cast (heartbreakingly) out of it. Charles Howard's (Bridge's) loss of his son is too telegraphic, though it's a fine touch to show him wailing with the boy's body but with his voice barely audible: it's one more example of the movie's sense of the period and of its restraint.
Right from the first the horse races are astonishing in the camera's closeness and vividness, the way we feel the danger and physicality of the jockeys' brutal competition with one another. Since we know Pollard is a failed prizefighter and general scrapper, we take in stride that fact that he's physically fighting with other jockeys during the early races. This is a movie about horse racing and the races had better be terrific, and they are. It's when we see the power of those sequences that we realize Seabiscuit has the makings of a popular classic.Jeff Bridges' performance in particular seems etched in stone. There are touches of Jimmy Stewart, Joseph Cotton, even Orson Welles in his role and his looks. The chameleon Bridges comes carrying traces of Coppola's Tucker, but he has entered into the period and the tradition with utter conviction. Cooper's austere minimalism, because it is the essential spirit of the movie, its understatement (litotes), is the central performance. He is a man who communicates better with horses than with men. McGuire's performance is the noisiest, but he too reflects the social restraints of the period, and his wings are clipped before the final triumph can take place. This was a time when people had superiors and recognized it by calling them Sir and Mister. Everyone male wore a suit and tie, even jockeys off duty.
Seabiscuit's ability to tug at the heartstrings first appears when Red Pollard is let go by his destitute father so he can be a jockey. The moment is deeply sad because what seems an act of heroic renunciation by a loving parent is in fact abandonment, and it feeds the young man's rage thenceforth. And it's more complex than that because it grows out of the enormous pressures of the Depression, a time when millions in America wandered westward deprived of everything but their cars and a few possessions.Not only Bridges' performance but whole sequences of Seabiscuit seem etched in stone and contain examples of textbook-perfect editing that possesses sweep and complexity and advances the story while keeping our focus on the prevailing mood.This is, of course, the classic American story of triumph out of defeat and resolution out of conflict. As is a little too clearly pointed out, all three men, Charles Howard, Tom Smith, and Red Pollard, have had great devastation and loss in their lives (echoed by the whole country's economic devastation, failure, and loss of nerve; and it's implied -- with some failure of restraint -- that Seabiscuit's underdog triumphs were as needed as the New Deal). Their horse was rescued by Smith (Chris Cooper) when it was going to be shot because it seemed unruly and untrainable. Out of all this failure and tragedy the men forge their victories: Seabiscuit, the horse that lacked breeding, was untrainable, and was `too small'; Pollard, abandoned by his parents, beaten in many prize fights, secretly blind in one eye and `too big' to be a top jockey; Smith, a gifted horse tamer and trainer reduced to riding the rails and hoboing; Bridges, the self-made millionaire devastated by the destruction of all his hopes in a ruined economy and the sudden death of his young only son. They bond together to make Seabiscuit into one of the greatest racehorses in history. Who wouldn't be moved by this? Only the conventional fat man who's War Admiral's snobbish Maryland owner. It's all about heart, and Seabiscuit's got it.William H. Macy's caricatured portrait of an alcoholic radio announcer is a highlight, in the sense of a bright spot on a painting. It's a shrill and brittle performace that we tolerate because of the moments of relief Macy's little comic vignettes provide. Subtlety is sacrificed to provide an effect, and to brush in a bit of humor amid all the earnestness. One only wishes there were more of a progression; that the character didn't sip from the same bottle in every scene but got drunker, or soberer, as things went along.We have to allow for the exigencies of filmmaking that required ten horses to be used for Seabiscuit, leading to the irony that this unique horse is a composite.If you accept its conventionality, Seabiscuit is not just a good movie but a great one.",Null,79,102,29 July 2003
Revolutionary Road," Mid-century marriage meltdown
","The talented English stage director Sam Mendes has made another movie that focuses, like his earlier 'American Beauty,' on Stateside suburban discontent. This time his source is Richard Yates' acclaimed 1961 novel of the same name, whose action takes place in 1955. The movie reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet (now Mendes' wife) for the first time since 'Titanic,' which turned both of them into big stars. All of which makes this a movie well worth seeing, and DiCaprio and Winslet, seasoned and proved now, give intense, balls-out performances, as do several in the supporting cast, especially the edgy character actor Michael Shannon. It doesn't all quite work as a movie. Despite performances that are a knockout, the movie feels perfect, yet empty. But the novel is a stunner and even delivered in this skeletal, overly theatrical form leaves you with plenty to think about.'Revolutionary Road' is a passionate indictment of the roles of men and women in mid-century America and the conformism and lack of imagination imposed by the prevailing institutions. Familiar topics perhaps, but Yates' treatment of them is a seminal one. This will show you where Women's Lib came from. A memorable if artificial shot of an army of men marching down into Grand Central to work in Manhattan, all of them in hats, underlines the prevalent sense that middle class white men were as imprisoned as their spouses in their gray flannel suits, their air-conditioned nightmare, their other-directed conformity from which the only escapes were the liquid lunch of tee many martoonies, the quick rolls in the hay with sad little secretaries. The movie is good at capturing the outward shell; not so successful at penetrating within. The Fifties are dangerous ground for younger filmmakers, who have trouble seeing beyond the shiny cars and jaunty jazz.Another, perhaps more insidious, defense was irony and detachment. Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) seeks refuge there, while dabbling in martinis and secretaries too. He pretends to disdain his copy-writing job with a business machine company. For this same company his father worked for decades, unnoticed by executives, as a New Jersey sales representative. Frank, despite his disdain, which implies he envisions still better for himself, is on the way to a materially better life than his Willy Loman father. At thirty he drives a Buick, has this decent job, and lives with his pretty blond wife and their two young kids in a pretty house in Connecticut with lots of lawn. Their neighbor, Mrs. Helen Givings (Kathy Bates), the real estate agent who sold them the house, thinks them a lovely couple. When April (Winslet) was dating Frank, she thought him the most interesting, different, adventurous man she'd ever met. They think of themselves as detached from their surroundings: intelligent, creative. He has spoken of living in Paris. She fancies herself as an actress.But nothing works, because April and Frank are only pretending to be better than their surroundings and are both quite ordinary. The couple comes on scene with a major row after April has starred in an amateur play production that is a flop. In the novel, the performance of the play, and April's evident pain as it disintegrates around her, are described in excruciating detail, but the movie skips all that and cuts to the drive home. What is surprising is how mean and accusatory Frank is. He originally thought of nice and comforting things to say to April about the play, but that's all in the book, not the movie.April cooks up the plan of moving to Paris. They will sell the house and the car. She has heard secretaries for international organizations get high salaries in Paris. She'll work to support them (presumably with a nanny for the kids) while Frank discovers himself. Frank very reluctantly gives in, and they go ahead with plans to move. April reassures the children they'll survive with fewer toys and new friends. The Givings bring their son John (Shannon), who's been in a mental institution, and while the Paris idea shocks his parents, he congratulates Frank and April on their decision to escape from the boredom of middle-class America. Then something happens, and it all falls apart. For one thing, a memo Frank writes as a lark gets him recognition from the top management and the offer of a promotion that's too exciting to resist. The verbal fights between April and Frank, fueled by endless drinks and cigarettes, get more and more bitter, until finally there is silence, in a chilling nice breakfast when April sees Frank off to work before tragedy strikes. Frank is not an attractive person. He has neither talent nor character, and takes unconvincing refuge in being a smart-ass. He's a rotter, condescending toward his wife, a liar, a man too full of himself to possess self-awareness. DiCaprio embraces and embodies all that. The role of April is harder because she's repressed, hiding. Her earlier enthusiasm for Frank as the most interesting person she's met becomes pathetic when it's revealed to have been so mistaken. Ultimately the movie has trouble working as a movie because both its main characters are hollow shells. It would take a lot of prose (which is found in Yates' novel) to fill in substance around these shells.The screenplay captures the main movements of the novel. But the exquisite cinematic detail, the precisely correct-to-period drapes, rugs, couches, suits, hats, and so forth, down to the overly-interesting artworks on the Wheeler walls, distract from the intense interactions. Must quite so many cigarettes be lit, cocktail glasses of gin quaffed? The movie's devastating scenes from a marriage would work better as a play with simple sets, without sprinklers and lawns and Buicks and Grand Central. Sam Mendes, as a stage director, may have miscalculated in seeing the screenplay as a series of intense scenes of dialogue and not perceiving how the movie-work surrounding these scenes of dialogue would undermine them.",8,2,4,11 January 2009
28 Days Later...," . . .is less than it's being cracked up to be.
","In 28 Days Later. . . Danny Boyle and Alex Garland `team up' again, as it were, as they did in effect when Boyle made a movie out of Garland's popular book, The Beach.  This new lower budget grainy digital video effort seems to have fared a very great deal better with the critics than the high budget Leo Di Caprio version of The Beach.  Is it better?  I don't really think so. I had fun watching it, but considering the way it collapses into incoherence two thirds of the way through I find its almost universal acclaim  and the sheer amount of critical interest lavished on it in the press -- somewhat had to fathom. Boyle hasn't yet gotten back to the knack he had in Trainspotting and Shallow Grave for making young grunge hip and suspenseful and edgy.  His doomsday trip can't match what is in many ways its model, George Romero's ghoul flicks, especially the imperishable low-budget original, Night of the Living Dead.  He took the chance of working in a low budget and without stars, but ultimately he doesn't take the chance of being really gross and transgressive.I think people were so very hard on The Beach because pretty-puss Leo was in it and it was so glossy and beautiful and a bit pretentious in its promises of excitement and mind games.  It looked like Boyle had turned slick.  Had he?  Garland wrote his book with the skin of his teeth and just got lucky. And actually the movie recaptured most of the more vivid moments of the book really well and the locations were as exotic and beautiful as you could have possibly wanted, Di Caprio and the others did an excellent job, but people would have none of it.  28 Days Later is as lucky as The Beach was unlucky.  Coming in the midst of a host of overblown and costly American summer blockbusters, it somehow graces  the Cineplex and provides unexpected delight because of its modest means and the offbeat punch it manages to pack.  But let's not forget that the same Garland/Boyle team is at work on it, only this time there is no book to be loyal to.  That's where the trouble comes in. The movie starts off with a series of dazzling traumatic set pieces, as any apocalyptic flick has to and would.  There's the animal rights activists' misguided invasion of a lab where they release a bunch of primates infected with the disease of rage.  They go out and bite humans and before you know it London is empty. (Somehow end-of-the-world movies usually restrict their devastation to the place where they were made.) This is one of these clever devices low budget sci-fi filmmakers resort to:  all they had to do was shoot so early in the morning that nobody was out.  There's the freshness of the newborn in the awakening of naked Jim (Cillian Murphy) in a hospital to walk out to a city more populated with half consumed soft drink cans than with people.  The first half hour is hard to forget because it has that freshness of seeing a world through startled young eyes in an atmosphere of total adrenaline rush; the people who appear to Jim and help him are vivid because they seem the only people in the world.There are a lot of movies as good as this one that nobody remembers and few have seen.  28 Days has gained admiration with a general audience little acquainted with the pulp sci-fi genre just as Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon did three years ago with people who didn't know that lots of Chinese language martial arts flicks were just as good.I would feel like a bad sport saying this, because 28 Days Later is good fun and toward the end has some beautiful grainy expressionistic images, except that it stops making sense once the hero gets to the military camp where he's been promised they will be saved and instead all sorts of confused nastiness is happening.  We don't get a lot of views of the `Infected,' and when they do appear it's quick like the battles in Gladiator so we can't really see what's happening.  This is one way of bypassing budget restrictions but not, perhaps, the most satisfying one.  If  you think back to Night of the Living Dead it was way, way scarier.  And right up to the last terrible irony, it all made grim good sense.",Null,0,0,28 July 2003
City of God," A whirlwind of virtuoso filmmaking
","'Cidade de Deus' (City of God) begins with a chase after an escaped chicken and it's a mad rush from then on in this mind-boggling autobiography of a favela dweller who works his way out of the slums into mainstream Rio de Janeiro by becoming a photographer (in the original book he's a writer but this change toward the visual is a smart one).  Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund have forged a truly amazing movie: people are absolutely dazzled by the vibrancy of the action and the sheer brilliance of the filmmaking. Indeed, 'Cidade de Deus' is a technical wonder, bursting with virtuoso effects that never distract from the action.  True, there is a degree of violence that sometimes makes people walk out of the auditorium midway.  Some viewers and some critics complain there's so much killing that you're numbed.  But whether we like this movie or not, we have to acknowledge its stunning craftsmanship.  And observers say that though the slums of Rio have cleaned up and quieted down in the last decade, what the movie shows is true to life.And here is what's most remarkable:  that the movie tells an extraordinarily well-organized and coherent story; that with a large cast and a dizzying onrush of scenes and despite the underlying madness of this Brazilian slum life of poverty, drugs, and violence these scenes show us, everything in 'Cidade de Deus' is lucid and logical.  The technical flash isn't a matter of confusing us, but of conveying the hopped up, bloody action precisely and succinctly:  this is what the dissolves and jump cuts, fast cutting, freeze-frames, and speeded up film are all for:  to condense events without loss of vividness; to tell the complex story without losing our sense of its vivid texture.'City of God' is a masterpiece of editing.Essentially it's a series of short stories (indicated by small onscreen titles) focused on a group of interrelated favela figures of the narrator's generation.  At the end of the chicken sequence, the camera revolves around 'Rocket,' the narrator ('Busca-pé,' Alexandre Rodrigues), and as it revolves the background fades to sandy color and we're taken to his early youth and the 'Tender Trio' hijacking a truck and throwing cash to kids, which introduces us to several of the most important characters, 'Bennie' (Bené, Phellipe Haagensen as the older boy) and 'Little Dice' (later to become 'Little Zee,' 'Zé Pequeno,' played by Leandro Firmino da Hora), a team whose last moment together in a strobe-lit Seventies disco teeming with dancers is the emotional climax of the movie.  This powerful scene is the triumph of the homicidal, mad drug lord, Zee, over the 'hippy' 'playboy' Bennie, who is about to take his girlfriend Angélica (Alice Braga) to the country and live in peace, and it's also a moment of extraordinary sexual tension and sadness.  Of all the senseless killings, this is the most senseless -- and yet the most meaningful.But before the disco climax, there's the 'Miami Motel Robbery,' when a brothel holdup by the fledgling gangsters turns into a grizzly, sensual bloodbath.  It's only later that we learn why and how. Characteristically, the movie always goes back to dot its i's and cross its t's, with an assertion of narrative control rather like the style of Tony Richardson's 1963 film version of Fielding's 'Tom Jones.'   The motel robbery fixes the seal of violence on the generation. The next major story is 'The Death of Shaggy.'  Shaggy too tries to escape the favela with a girlfriend to live the hippy country life of 'paz y amor' that Bennie later envisions. Shaggy is a handsome, charming, lazy young gangster who's clearly much too young and too pretty to die, but down he goes, and seeing a photographer at the death of Shaggy is what first leads Rocket to get a camera for himself.The underlying personal thread is the story of how Rocket becomes a news photographer and escapes from the slum; a minor one is how he loses his virginity.  He loves Angélica and the first freeze frames we see are his shots of her on the beach, where he cunningly casts her current beau, Thiago (Daniel Zettel), in shadow.  Even in this first appearance Thiago characteristically expresses his taste for coke:  this will later lead the relatively suburban, well off (and redheaded, Jewish) boy to become a close associate of Lil' Zee in his final days.  The constant killings as the favela scene becomes wilder and more violent turn the streets and houses into a grim, dark slaughterhouse, but there's still a stunning sense of the resilience of youth in, for instance, the way Thiago manages to survive both his addiction and his closeness to the most murderous people in the slum. When Thiago leaves the beach in this early scene is when 'The Runts' first appear, delaying Rocket's initiation into sex just when it might have begun.One of the virtuoso devices is to slide visually through time while Rocket narrates and this is notably illustrated by 'The Story of the Apartment' sequence where we instantly see the locale become more rundown and empty as it devolves from somebody's home into an increasingly active drug dealing headquarters and ultimately Zee's center of evil power.  It's the Story of Lil' Zee that goes back to the Miami Motel Robbery to show the first shocking evidence of his love of killing even as a child.  'Cidade de Deus' isn't just full of young men but of children with guns.  The final gang that takes over is Las Cocotas, The Runts, a band of lawless sub-teen and early-teen boys.  Lil' Zee maintains rigid order, but The Runts mess up security because they rob at will.  To discipline The Runts, in one of the most pathetic and gruesome scenes, Zee forces one of them to choose whether he wants to be shot in the hand or foot, and one of Zee's own youngest recruits must kill one of The Runts then and there.With the increasing focus on Lil' Zee's story the camera movement speeds up and rapid handheld pans become the rule in every scene of violence.  The passage of time and the progression toward greater violence is cunningly indicated in the gradual changes in visual style that the movie goes through before our eyes.  There are speeded up sequences shot from far overhead to show Zee's evolution from random killer to ruling druglord, as if we are looking at a map, which in fact here we are, a map of the city to show an expanding sphere of control.And (again the logic is crystal clear, not to say relentless) since Zee's power comes through dealing drugs, the next sub-section is a small treatise on the nature of 'Drug Dealing,' again illustrated with a rapid succession of narrated scenes and shots.Rocket's personal story becomes interwoven with Zee's again (as it was when they were young) after a revenge feud involving the handsome 'Knockout Ned' becomes such a war that it gets the favela violence into the papers and Rocket, who works as a delivery boy and befriends a photographer, does portraits of Zee and his gang that wind up on page one.  True to the neatness of the whole movie's construction is the finale, which returns to the opening chase of the escaped chicken and spins out from there to a last shootout, bribes, and a takeover of power from Zee by The Runts, all of which Rocket gets on film, securing his hiring by the newspaper as a photographer.'Cidade de Deus' comes out of a great tradition of Brazilian movies about favelas and street boys whose most notable example is Hector Babenco's 1981 'Pixote,' but it is more a virtuoso piece of filmmaking than anything heretofore.  It's not only a triumph of editing (and storytelling) but of casting:  the youthful actors drawn from the actual milieu of the film are essential to its extraordinary energy and life.",Null,1,3,4 May 2003
Get Out," Your worst nightmare
","The first-time director is an African American actor, comedian, film director, and screenwriter, formerly of the Comedy Central show Key & Peele. One reviewer says this will be 'the boldest - and most important - studio genre release of the year.' The horrible rich white family out in the country focuses its malevolent attention exclusively on black men. Their daughter brings her black boyfriend to meet them for the weekend. It's a Brit who plays the boyfriend, Chris Washington, Daniel Kaluuya. You identify with him throughout. As his TSA employee best friend Rod, comic LilRel Howery breaks the tension nicely by providing humor. Some say the play with racial ideas is more a focus than the horror, and it's not horrible enough. It's just a broad and simple horror movie - seeing the poster for Gore Verbinski's A Cure for Wellness on the way out reminded me how much more complex and visually rich that is. Nonetheless I was shattered when it was over. This is a movie that skillfully ramps up feelings and concerns about race we already have or would have. Metacritic rating 83%.

2012," The law of diminishing returns: why great effects don't make great drama
","Emmerich is a specialist in rah-rah actioners with a penchant for global disaster. He tried alien invasion in his 1996 Independence Day, a world suddenly become uninhabitable via climate change in The Day After Tomorrow, and now -- what? 2012 cynically trades on a superstitious belief that the Mayans were right to predict the end of days in that year. But that's really just a come-on for cultists that's quickly dropped. The arc of the script is more a high-tech replay of Noah and the Flood. While Independence Day was sci-fi hokum, and Tomorrow was just dubious science, the explanation behind Emmerich's latest planetary doom is pure mumbo-jumbo. Obviously this director doesn't care how he gets to his effects, and he inserts the same sets of weepy vignettes and touching family reunions every time.Emmerich and his Austrian co-writer Harold Klosser borrow a popular (but groundless) doomsday myth that an alignment of planets could touch off disaster -- this time, by making the sun's fires flare up. That in turn makes neutrinos start to heat up the earth's core so tectonic plates divide all over the surface of the planet. No matter to these guys that neutrinos, tiny neutral particles that go through the earth in unimaginable quantity all the time without harm, are the least likely cause of tectonic shock disaster. No matter that the theory of a resulting 'crustal shift,' derailing the earth from its axis and making the continents slip into new positions, has long been discredited as a real possibility. 2012 isn't sci-fi; it's bogus science, far more completely bogus than Day After Tomorrow's -- and the latter, hokey as it was, was a far better movie than this unrestrained and utterly dumb blockbuster.Much of the physical action concerns a little broken, and soon happily reunited, family, headed by Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), and consisting of his estranged wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and their kids, Noah (Liam James) and Lily (Morgan Lily). Kate has been shacked up with Gordon (Tom McCarthy), and Noah has transferred his loyalty to this fellow. But that's going to change! Gordon will die a sad but quickly forgotten death and Jackson and Kate will be kissing and Noah and Jackson bonding in an hour or so. Then there's the noble US President (Danny Glover), who elects to go down with the ship, and his high-minded daughter (Thandie Newton), who's been preserving the world's art treasures, or the Louvre's, anyway. A French official spills the beans on this and his car explodes in the same tunnel where Lady Di died: what about that! Jackson is a hero, and a miraculous survivor, through a multiplication of the kind of narrow escapes that motivated the 'Perils of Pauline' serials in the silent era. I'd call this the 'Ya doob' effect, using the Egyptian dialect phrase meaning 'just barely.' In his review of 2012 Anthony Lane put his finger on the basic element Emmerich uses as ''the binding rule of melodrama, which decrees that all escapes shall be narrow, no more than the breadth of a hair'; 'The best thing about time is the nick of it.' This effect is used so relentlessly for Jackson's exploits that they lose their suspense completely and just become shticks.Equally tired is the nobility of Danny Glover and his cloyingly upright daughter Thandie Newton. The inevitable, discreet romance that develops, with daddy dead and the world half saved, between Ms. Newton and the top US scientist, played with largely wasted dash by the talented Chiwetel Ejiofor: how wearying it is to watch this! George Segal and cohort Blu Mankum do saccharine turns as cruise ship musicians trying to reunite with estranged offspring via phone at the edge of doom. A doom that takes far too long to come, and is dragged out with underwater sequences stolen from Cameron's Titanic. Bad idea to remind us of a really good disaster movie! The superstitious and paranoid (and above all naive) in the audience will also have much to cluck over when it comes to the plan to 'save' a small part of the planet's population, and the way the elite's knowledge of what's coming is cunningly hidden from the masses of humanity. Isn't that just the way? Except that it's not, and if there were truth in any of this, it would have been all over the Internet. The parts of this movie that are hokiest and least able to survive scrutiny (though none of it survives that long) are those related to global knowledge of the impending disaster; who arrived at it, how it was dealt with, and what the timetable was.But in all this tiresome nitpicking I've been bypassing the big fun for the audience, and in the view of some, the malicious delight of German-born Mr. Emmerich, in what Variety reviewer Todd McCarthy calls his 'lip-smacking smorgasbord of global annihilation' -- the way we get to see California sink into the sea, the White House smashed by a giant Navy warship, Michelangelo's frescoes in the Vatican drop to earth as St. Peter's in Rome crumbles, the Eiffel Tower floated away, Rio's Christ the Redeemer statue disintegrated, and Las Vegas, Yellowstone Park, all of Tibet, exploded from below and turned into toast. Woody Harrelson, in a wild-eyed caricature of himself and draped in long fake beard and elaborate hair extensions, gets to go down in a kind of kitsch grandeur of a Gotterdammerung atop a peak in Yellowstone.Well, yeah, wow! But without a believable plot or interesting characters, who cares? And frankly, no matter how good the CGI has become, an unbelievable event still looks unreal because I know it's not real. If 'Less is more,' then more is indubitably less; and more-and-more ultimately adds up to just that much less. It's the law of diminishing returns.",5,0,1,26 November 2009
The Lives of Others," Beautifully restrained study of moral complexity and totalitarianism
","The Lives of Others/Das Leben der Anderenthe title of this striking German film points to the vicariousness of a world dominated by suspicion and surveillance. In East Germany before the Berlin Wall came down the STASI, the state police, wanted to watch everyone. In 1984 a file is opened and STASI men are set to work watching a man and a woman who are above reproach. In the paranoid world of the eastern zone, innocence itself, as in Kafka, is suspicious. In charge of the case, code name 'Laszlo,' is a certain Weisler (Ulrich Mühe). And those thoroughly bugged and listened to day and night are Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a noted playwright, friend of the Chancellor, politically correct in the eyes of the regime, and his beloved girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), a famous actress. Behind this particular project are political higher-ups, sly and manipulative, jealous of each other's positions, kingpins of a system that in a few years will toss them out. This is a paranoid 1984 not far from the one Orwell imagined. When Weisler's men bug Dreyman's flat, the lady across the hall sees them. Weisler tells her if she speaks a word to anybody, her daughter will be thrown out of the university. One of the officials wants Christa-Maria. Now that she is vulnerable, on the examination table, so to speak, he can move in on her. It's only a matter of time before somebody will be begging for mercy.Weisler is a rigid mole, but he has sensitive eyes. Like the Wall itself, his vision will crumble and we will see it happen. Weisler is a teacher in the police school, but Dreyman's life becomes his teacher. Dreyman is tall and glamorous. He sheds his middle class origins by never wearing a tie. He makes love to a beautiful woman who Weisler later declares to be a great artist. Weisler has to make do with flabby prostitutes on a tight schedule. Dreyman introduces Weisler to the humanizing value of music and poetry; he listens to a certain sonata, and he begins to read Brecht.Weisler and Dreyman are both flawed heroes. The bad men are Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), Weisler's threatening supervisor, and the loathsome 'Culture' minister with police powers Bruno Hempf (Thomas Tieme).The question may arise in our minds: if Dreyman's so above reproach to the East Germans, how shall we admire him? But this film deals in nuances, moral ambiguities through which despair can turn to hope. The sonata was given to Dreyman for his birthday by a blacklisted friend and mentor, Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleimert), and Jerska's suicide leads the playwright to risk smuggling facts and an impassioned protest to the West. Dreyman does become admirable to us. But so does Weisler, the STASI agent, because by this time he wants to protect the objects of his surveillance, and to protect them he arranges to be the only man on the case. Dreyman evades exposure through Weisler's silent help. But there are casualties. Christa-Maris is catnip to the fat cats, and she's caught in the middle. Weisler covers his tracks, but his superior knows he's done something, and Weisler's sent to steam open letters in a cellar for the rest of his career. It's there that we see him get the extraordinary news four years later that the Wall is coming down.The Lives of Others is free from the melodrama of pursuit and torture, but it knows the terror of the sudden house search, the second knock upon the door; of extortion, humiliation, and betrayal; the soul death of the creative person silenced, the calculated draining away of the will to act. It's a movie of dignity and hope too, though it speaks of long gray subterranean exile. The music Jerska gave Dreyman is called The Sonata of a Good Man. A chance remark by one of the fallen officials years later leads Dreyman to track down the facts (accessible now) and to write about them. When Weisler speaks the film's final lines, 'It's for me,' they're among the most resonant in recent years. The Lives of Others is a little long in places  it threatens sometimes to morph into a mini-series  but its restraint and quietude make for an impressive cumulative effect, a sense of the prevailing grayness and rage totalitarianism generates. It's specific to the place and time, but gracefully universal, and it reveals the tall German with the aristocratic name, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, to be a world-class director.",9,10,14,10 February 2007
I Am Legend," Will Smith saves the world
","Will Smith and the special effects are the two main reasons for watching I Am Legend. It might also help to be a fan of Bob Marley. This is another adaptation of sci-fi and 'Twilight Zone' writer Richard Mathieson's 1954 novel of the same name. There have been two previous film variations, with Vincent Price ('64) and Charlton Heston ('71). The basic story is about a military scientist who believes himself to be the last surviving healthy human after a virus has depopulated the planet leaving only (in this version) hordes of raging nocturnal mutants. Neville (this time Smith) has injected himself with an experimental vaccine that makes him immune. He's still trying to find one that will work on others and cure the infected. He insists (this time) on remaining at what he calls 'Ground Zero'Manhattanto do his work.The movie has done well with some NYC film critics. Apparently they like seeing a post-apocalyptic version of their home town free, if at a horrible cost, of tourists or holiday crowds.Speaking of costs, Lawrence's movie has gotten another kind of injection: lots of money, $200 million, by reports. Money does not bring sophistication and indeed may banish it. But it means the filmmakers can afford Smith, a charismatic movie star who makes a convincing superhero. Already extremely buff in I, Robot (which this role somewhat reprises), Smith's now not only in even better physical shape (we see him working out, with his trusty female German Shepherd, Sam), but also a mercurial actor, able to register every conceivable human emotion. Unfortunately for most of the two hours he has nobody to share his emotions with but Sam.The most notable ones are desperation, loneliness, and despair. This is, as has been pointed out, not only the most expensive Rin Tin Tin movie of all time, but also a vision of the ultimate urban alienation. I Am Legend is at its strongest when it evokes the sadness of a world without people in it. Other than Sam, Neville has nobody to talk to but manikins he seems to have arranged himself in a video shop, and at home nobody to watch but Shrek and old recordings of TV news shows before disaster struck, some time around Christmas. It's not easy being the last man in New York. Occasionally Neville sees flashbacks of the departure of his wife and son during a tumultuous and unsuccessful evacuation that recalls both Spielberg's War of the Worlds and Cuaron's Children of Men. Then he knows he is alone. Roaring about the city in a Mustang 5000 feebly trying to shoot wild deer (which he's surprisingly inept at), talking to Sam, and doing his workouts are not distractions for long from the angst of isolation. For us, it's fun looking at the CGI images of a deserted Manhattan that is already, after three years, overgrown with weeds and overrun with deer being preyed upon by lions.This high-budget Neville lives appropriately, in a big house on Washington Square fitted with heavy steel doors to shut him in at night, when the infected ones, who're light sensitive like vampires, go on the rampage. In the basement is a full laboratory where he pursues his research on animals and captured infected humans, recording his findings in streaming video. The bridges may have split in two, but he's still got power. He also has an AM radio message on all stations setting up a meeting with any healthy survivors down by the docks at noon every day. Like the father and son in Cormac McCarthy's The Road, he sometimes breaks fearfully into houses to scavenge canned goods and other preserved eatables.In Mathieson's Cold War era novel, it was biological warfare between Russian and China that depopulated the planet; this time it's the fault of science. Three years ago a doctor (Emma Thompson) engineered a virus capable of preventing cancer. Unfortunately it horribly mutated, turning the the inoculated into raging vampire killers. The resulting creatures are bald hyper-muscled creatures very like the infected of 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later only more expensive, though they lack variety, since 90% of them look like Woody Harrelson on steroids.Perhaps as a carryover from the book, Neville has an uneasy hold on his sanity, and despite his air of logic in the lab (and his denial of the existence of Godthough he fervently believes in the humanism of Bob Marley) he can occasionally lose it, fly into a rage, and do really stupid things. Handling a dire situation unwisely, he gets himself injured and brings grief to Sam. Despairing later, he randomly attacks a pack of the infected, apparently welcoming death at their hands (or teeth). And then somehow he's rescued by a mother and her young son, Anna (Alice Braga of City of God) and Ethan (Charlie Tahan). By then the movie is past its prime and the finale is neither convincing nor satisfying, and visions of half a dozen other zombie/vampire sci-fi movies, all of them made on a lower budget with more interesting results, are left dancing in our headsas well as some other big budget ones that weren't any better than this momentarily exciting and energetic, but not imaginatively very stimulating effort.",7,1,6,17 December 2007
Gran Torino," Up from machismo: at 78, Clint's still kickin' ass
","Well-seasoned filmmakers are no rarity these days. The Portuguese director Manoel de Oliveira is still working at 100. Though a mere 78, Clint may be the most prolific and the feistiest of the senior helmers. The last six years have been an Eastwoodian renaissance. His relatively perfunctory 'Blood Work' was followed by an outstanding quartet: 'Mystic River,' 'Million Dollar Baby,' 'Flags of Our Fathers,' and 'Letters of Iwo Jima.' And now in one year, 'Changeling' and 'Gran Torino.' In the latter, written by newcomers Dave Johansson and Nick Schenk, Clint not only directs but stars as curmudgeonly senior citizen Walt Kowalski--who emerges as a culturally sensitized but still confrontational Dirty Harry. Walt is a retired auto worker who presides disapprovingly over his wife's funeral as the film opens. He's not impressed by the young priest. He has no use for his smug sons or his greedy, piercing-adorned, disrespectful granddaughter, whom the camera catches text-messaging during the priest's funeral oration. Walt ushers one son and daughter-in-law out of the house on his birthday, with the presents they have brought, when they suggest he consider moving to a retirement community. All the Polish and Irish people have moved out of the Detroit neighborhood where Walt has long lived. Now his neighbors are Hmong people he sniffs at and addresses indiscriminately as 'slope' or 'nip' or 'chink.' Walt never drops the epithets. He considers them an essential aspect of manly banter and enjoys tossing them back and forth with his barber and a construction boss friend. But any implied racism melts away when members of a Hmong gang begin to harass his young neighbor Thao (Bee Vang) and force Thao to attempt the theft of Walt's vintage Gran Torino automobile as part of his initiation. Walt, a decorated Korean War vet, confronts Thao with a rifle and saves his car. But later he drives away the gang at gunpoint to protect Thao from its harassing him further.These two events have a whole string of consequences. Henceforth the gang has it in for both Thao and Walt. Thao's family showers Walt with ritual offerings of food and flowers. Walt is now seen as a neighborhood friend and protector of the Hmong. Thao's bolder and more outspoken sister Sue (Bee Vang) latches onto Walt too. Walt learns to love Hmong cooking and discovers he has more in common with his 'slope' neighbors than with his own sons. Thao, who is fatherless, is commanded by his mother to work for Walt to compensate for the attempted theft, and a mentoring and bonding process begins.In 'Gran Torino' Clint gets to play a reformed bigot, mentor, and senior citizen Dirty Harry all in one person. He speaks in a hoarse whisper that can modulate from a mild roar to a purr to a bark. Maybe this movie serves as a kind of apologia and justification for the simplicities of the Dirty Harry series. It adds complexities and nuances, but then it undercuts them by still bringing out the guns and resolving issues in violent confrontations.The man is truly remarkable. The movie is unusual in its combination of racist slurs, decency, and revenge. But in all accuracy the solution Walt finds is not revenge but a sacrificial correction that insures his neighbors' future. Still, if Walt Kowalski's behavior is taken literally he'll hardly come off as a good role model for anyone. The movie deserves credit for pointing to the problem of Asian (and specifically Hmong) gangs. Among the Hmong, Sue says, 'the girls go to college, the boys go to jail.' Gran Torino was shot in a few weeks. The Hmong cast is authentic, but not all are great actors. The ending is something out of the Westerns, with a new twist. Much of the move is like an instructional film on multi-ethnic understanding and family relations. It's good hearted but simplistic and not ultra polished, despite the pros in the crew and at the helm.There is a secondary theme involving the young priest who presides at the funeral of Walt's wife. He's called Father Janovich, for some reason, though he's played by the very Irish-looking Christopher Carley. Walt tells him to his face he has no use for him. He tells him he's a 'kid,' 'fresh out of the seminary,' an 'overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who holds the hands of superstitious old ladies and promises them eternity.' As far as Walt can see this kid knows nothing about birth and death. By film's end the boyish clergyman and Walt have come to terms and the younger man has learned something. As time goes on Walt is clearly ill, yet he continues his hard drinking and his cigarette smoking. His life isn't very happy. Maybe that's why he's willing to go for broke in defense of his Hmong neighbors. The realities of his situation are something the simplistic screenplay, which resembles a TV program of pre-cable days, does not choose to delve into. But whatever its faults, 'Gran Torino' has the same kind of strong, sterling simplicity the director displayed in 'Million Dollar Baby,' which he also starred in as well as directed.This is the year for the Hmong in America to get noticed, it seems. There is a detailed, rich documentary about a Laotian Hmong family and their life in the USA that came out a few months ago, Ellen Kurras' 'The Betrayal (Nerakhoon).' The impact of the gangs on Hmong families is shown there too. But there's no Clint to come to the rescue.",8,1,4,30 December 2008
The Hurt Locker," 'The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug.''--Chris Hedges.
","Already celebrated for its breathtaking realism in depicting soldiers and explosions, The Hurt Locker is being called 'the best Iraq war movie,' with the qualification that the genre has been weak and the public response weaker. This is Kathryn Bigelow all right: macho men in dazzling exploits, exhilarating and always a little terrifying to watch, with adrenalin and testosterone spurting off the screen. If war is a drug, this movie could give you a contact high. Bigelow was obviously born to make a war movie. The only question is why she took this long to do so. Writer Mark Boal led her into it. He embedded with a bomb squad in Iraq, and came back with remarkable stories and a character to hold them together. He's Staff Sergeant William James, who's what in the genteel days of The English Patient was more commonly called a 'sapper,' a combat engineer who specializes in demolitions, minefields, and the like. Bigelow wisely chose Jeremy Renner, an unknown and unglamorous actor, for this pleasingly enigmatic role of a man who may be closer to bombs and timers than to his own comrades.The Hurt Locker (soldier slang for a real bad place) gives you immediacy and vérité soldier life, with the shaky digital camera and in-and-out zooms of the genre (the action is so good, we soon forget them, while in Brian De Palms's crude 2007 Redacted, they grate all through). Such authenticity is achieved in Brit documentary filmmaker Nick Broomfield's more political, excellent, little seen, low-budget 2005 drama The Battle for Haditha. It may not make his film unbiased, but Broomfield most notably gives more detail of the Iraqi P.O.V. -- using real Iraqis -- while Bigelow sticks to showing Iraqis as the American soldiers experience them -- an experience that turns out to be insane, paranoia-inducing, and scary. (In both movies one of the few friendly forms of contact is buying and selling pirated DVD's, the US soldiers buying, the Iraqis selling, and in both this contact becomes a key plot element.) Obviously Bigelow also had a much bigger budget, the better to provide a wealth of spectacular explosions, essential (or justified anyway) since this is about a small team of three men whose main (but by no means only) job is to find and defuse improvised explosive devices (IED's), the DIY but sometimes highly ingenious signature weapons of the Iraqi insurgency. There is also a horrifying body bomb; a complicated and lethal car bomb in front of a UN building; a suicide bomber who has a change of heart (as in Hany Abu-Assad's 2005 Paradise Now); and a hairy firefight with snipers (and a somewhat obtrusive cameo by Ralph Fiennes) out in the desert. Besides which the adrenalin-numbed Sergeant James independently gets himself and his two squad members, Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), into various private and probably unnecessary severe crap storms. All of this is staged with stunning accomplishment and a strong focus on character and the interactions, intense even when alienated, of these three men.The movie takes no political stand, other than Hedges' 'war is a drug.' This is like the point of view of Andrew Swoford used for Sam Mendes' 2005 Jarhead, which, however unsuccessful in some aspects and poorly received, conveys that soldiers don't question war because they're too busy doing dangerous jobs, or waiting and hoping to do them, and trying to stay alive till, God willing, their tour ends.The Hurt Locker is episodic and cyclical. It ends where it begins, with the protagonist joining a new team of strangers for another tour. Thanks to Boal's writing, Bigelow's fine directing, and an excellent cast, the episodes never seem routine or repetitive. But if you emerge with a sense of numbing danger and pointlessness that may not be inappropriate. The only structure is the routine one of datelines saying how many days are left in Bravo company's tour. But this is a figure that, as Kimberly Peirce's Stop-Loss depicts, is often set back to start again.The opening sequence, where James's predecessor is killed, leaving Eldridge and Sanborn in need of a new leader, is pretty obvious. It's so carefully set up you know what will happen. It's still excruciatingly tense, a textbook street IED diffusion job that conveys how terrified the two backup guys are and sets up what's to come. This is a team, with all three in radio contact and each with his function, Eldridge the lookout in charge of Sanborn, who's the guard. The street is surrounded with buildings and people and deep in unknowns. When James arrives shortly after his predecessor's body has been shipped home, he does a similar job, but it's all different.First we don't feel the danger except by remembering the first sequence, because James is so immune to it. Sanborn and Eldridge are freaking out because James doesn't stay in touch with him when he's suited up dealing with the device. They feel lost. We realize that the three before were a great team and we sense the rage and abandonment of his bereaved mates. There's immediate intense conflict between Eldridge, an elegant, chiseled black man with extensive Intelligence experience, and the puffy-cheeked James whom Eldridge calls 'redneck trailer trash' straight off to his face. These telegraphed macho conflicts, essential Bigelow, work because the jobs being done are all so convincingly and intensely depicted.This is a great movie but it leaves you empty. The director is so caught up in what she's doing that it's infectious, but the compelling intensity also represents a loss of perspective. Still, if there is any non-documentary Iraq war movie that's a must-see, this has got to be it, and it's by far the best thing the uneven but gifted Kathryn Bigelow has ever done. It's a game-changer, the new American war movie to beat.(This is a cut version of a 1,600-word review.)",9,57,87,17 July 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Trading monsters
","'The Twilight Saga' refers to four books, soon to be five, in the teen cult series by Stephanie Meyers about vampires in the Pacific Northwest and a young woman named Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart, on screen) who falls in love with one of them. You'd have to never go through a supermarket checkout stand not to know that Robert Pattinson, who plays Bella's pale undead beloved, Edward Cullen, is the number one heartthrob du jour. Pattinson's chiseled face, gypsy moth eyebrows and blood red lips peer out from every tabloid. 'Twilight' debuted a year ago in the first of what is anticipated as a franchise. Now the second film has come out.And for the squealing teenage girls who're the main (but by no means only) fans of the series, the titillation goes on. Essential to it, apparently, is the fact that the love of Bella and Edward is never consummated. These Washington State vampires, the Cullens, live like sedate, well-off middle-class folks, who can occupy a posh modern glass house because there's so little bright sunlight in that part of the country. They're so well-mannered they have adopted a different lifestyle, avoiding the consumption of human blood. Edward Cullen refuses to 'turn' Bella by taking a little bite into her veins, despite her repeatedly begging him to bring her into the vampire world. Though he adores her, he believes it better for her to remain a human, so he practices several kinds of abstinence. Noble fellow, this Edward. And he can fly through the air and lift an SUV when he wants as well. One never knew that vampires could have 'lifestyle choices,' while remaining ageless, super-powerful, and immortal.All this was interesting and fun when it was new to the neophyte in the first 'Twilight' movie. Unfortunately things slow down considerably in 'Twilight' 2, partly, perhaps, due to the more well-ordered direction of 'About a Boy's' Chris Weitz. Maybe Catherine Hardwicke (of 'Thirteen' and 'Lords of Dogtown') was unpredictable and difficult during the first 'Twilight' filming as rumors go, but her segment had spark (and, whatever the criticisms of its dialog and acting, was wildly successful at the box office). This one has less novelty -- and puts Edward in the background as he and his family, worried that the temptation of Bella's blood might become too great, depart from Forks, WA. Things plod leadenly from then on. The bloom is looking to be off the franchise already; it doesn't look like we've got another 'Harry Potter' on our hands.Bella finds solace by hanging out with Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) and helping him rebuild a couple of motorcycles. Jake is a total contrast to Edward -- a bronzed hunk, and recently rebuilt himself. Lautner boasted in promo trailers that he had put on 30 pounds of muscle between 'Twilights' 1 and 2. And when he first whips off his shirt the girls in the audience ooh and ah loudly. But he's not suave and witty like Edward, just sincere and warm and sort of healthy, in short, everything a self-respecting vampire is not. He's sweet and, well, buff and all, but not very magical. There isn't a lot more to say till it turns out Jacob and his Native American clan are werewolves -- but again of an updated sort, since they mainly run around shirtless in cutoffs and only turn into giant wolves when absolutely necessary to fend off vampires -- or if they get really, really mad. (Obviously Jake and Edward have got some negotiating to do.) The moon doesn't seem to have much to do with it. These giant werewolf leaps are the only major forays into CGI this time, and they're more repetitious and less fanciful than the ones in 'Twilight' 1.Edward's several lies when he quits Bella include the claim that she'll never lay eyes on him again. In fact he constantly reappears (in restrained CGI) to warn her against Jake and his pals and anything likely to bring on an adrenalin rush. Jake's just a 'friend' to Bella, though he's smitten. This time the relationship is not only sexless: they don't even kiss. The stories must satisfy an adolescent girl's fears and ambivalence about boys. Both Edward and Jake are utterly desirable, but also dangerous monsters. But while the danger turns into some explosive CGI from time to time, it never lastingly scars the heroine.One of the pleasures for me this time last year was the opportunity to see the glossy, Hollywood-fake 'Twilight' 1 story in the same week as Tomas Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In,' a remarkable and memorable Swedish film that, amazingly enough, also concerns teenagers in love, one a vampire, but treats the subject in a way that's truly arresting and strange, yet far more real than Ms. Meyers' conceptions. 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon' isn't as much fun to watch without a better movie about the same subject to compare it with.And what to make of the finale of 'Twilight 2' -- the return of the Cullens to Forks (after a tedious Italian episode even more boring and lame than anything in the Tom Hanks Dan Brown movies), and Edward's asking Bella to marry him? The appearances of Dakota Fanning and Michael Sheen as Volturi in Italy (don't ask) add nothing. But, anyway, with all the threats of vaporizing vampires and vampirizing the heroine are dropped, a marriage proposal as the climax? When things get this retro, you begin to see the logic of Edward's having been born in the year 1900.",6,2,8,20 November 2009
The Illusionist," Smoke and mirrors, unsexy romance; pretty scenes
","The Illusionist, NYTimes film critic Stephen Holden says, 'rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous.' Maybe. Its grandly staged magic shows in nineteenth-century costume are very pretty. But this fairy tale for adults with its suspenseful but simplistic plot and its feeble finale has you just plain slumbering at times too. To call it 'the miraculous' is glorifying what Eisenheim the Illusionist does -- just super-good magic tricks that con naïve nineteenth-century audiences in the age of Mesmer and Liszt. And Eisenheim's tricks are inevitably marred, cinematically, by the fact that he's mostly not doing them but having them done for him on film, processed in by the editors and special effects guys.Finally Holden also says this finds a good use for Edward Norton's 'disturbing inscrutability.' Is that what it is, though? Or is it a quality of being technically skilled but cold, mechanical, lacking in presence -- as well as limp in the area of sex appeal? (In fact the movie's sole purveyor of animal attraction is Jessica Biel as Sophie, the noblewoman both the Crown Prince and Eisenheim want. She and Eisenheim were secret teenage sweethearts even though she was an aristocrat and he was a carpenter's son (don't ask). She's sexy, but due to some shortcomings in the acting line she's a bit limp too -- you can't remember anything she says -- but if you look at her lips or her cleavage, that does the much-needed job of giving the screen a pulse.Actually, though Norton is the Illusionist, and his romance with Ms. Biel, revived when he returns from fifteen years of wandering in the Far East, highly dangerous now that she's semi-betrothed to the Crown Prince, is the movie's plot's main focus, still the movie wouldn't get off the ground if it weren't for the fact that Paul Giamatti has an equally important role as the head cop the Prince sends in to hound Eisenheim's footsteps. And that's not enough either: Rufus Sewall in his scene-chewing performance as the obnoxious Crown Prince gives Norton and Giamatti a very necessary run for their money. Put them all together, though, and despite the fact that this is a romance, you still haven't got a single male hearthrob -- not in these roles.Paul Giamatti is an impressively skillful mechanical 'character' actor -- something that we don't necessarily associate with movie acting, but which movies nonetheless always need. He can deliver any tone or personality, within the limits of his schlubby looks -- which aren't really so confining, given that the world arguably contains more schlubs than Hugh Jackmans. His technical skill and adaptability would mean little if he didn't have that cuddly, slightly goofy but still smart and competent quality that makes his characters believable, sympathetic, and fun to watch. There's always an edge of a twinkle in Paul's face, when he's working well. There's the bustle of the buffoon in him. He's best as an amiable loser, as he is as Harvey Pekar in American Splendor and as Miles in Sideways, his best roles to date, not to say immortal ones. Since then he has gone on to bigger and better checks, but not better acting opportunities or as good movies, though his work is always admirable and he brings palpable enthusiasm to his work. He inhabits Herr Uhl, the Viennese chief inspector of police he has to play in The Illusionist, as convincingly as ever, but the man is such a dutiful and serious good-boy-in-school type, that when the laughs come they tend to seem unintentional.Rufus Sewall, another versatile character actor whose looks give him the embarrassing additional option of being a leading man, is trying so hard to be strange and unpleasant and scary as Crown Prince Leopold, with his big dark over-precise moustache and thin parenthetical made-up looking eyebrows, that his looks in modern terms are so effete as to make him seem 'gay.' Compare Pascal Greggory as Jean Hervey in Patrice Chéreau's Gabrielle, a similarly effete character who's so subtly done he becomes complex and tragic. Sewall's Leopold is obtrusive, joining into the magic show at Eisenheim's command performance at court to his own embarrassment; but Leopold's menace in Biel's stiff staging seems a bit theatrical and empty. The worst thing he does on screen (to anybody else, anyway) is smack a lady, despite his wearing a sword and brandishing a pistol. The way he meets his end isn't surprising. Before that he has long turned into a barking stick figure. If only Sewall had been encouraged to play the Prince straighter (in both senses) and more vulnerable, the character would have been more interesting and the story would have had more subtlety.Simplistic and greeting-card conventional as it is, The Illusionist is a good-looking movie in a traditional costume-pic sort of way, and you have the feeling it actually was probably shot either in Vienna or somewhere that for Americans can pass for Vienna. There are nice street scenes and crowd scenes and the look is glossy without being overbearing or calling attention to itself -- it doesn't surprise you either, though.After the heroine comes to grief, things get messy and a bit confusing, where before they had all been orderly and well-paced. It's not clear what's gone wrong, but bad editing certainly is a factor. The way everything is explained in a montage of flash-shot reviews of past moments doesn't make up for the anticlimax. The Illusionist has a few good scenes, but no high drama. It is not helped by the chilly little voice Norton adopts, perhaps imitating some Forties costume drama, which the director himself may have wished to evoke.",6,3,7,19 August 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Please stop the magic
","Fincher's reputation soared last year after the release of his impressive 'Zodiac,' but 'Benjamin Button' takes him back down a peg. It even makes you wonder if 'Zodiac's' obsessive intensity was really self-aware or just a mindless offshoot of blind ambition. The new movie develops an elaborate conceit based on a Scott Fitzgerald story about a man who ages in reverse. But whatever ironies about human mortality (and vanity) one might be led to ponder are muffled because 'Forest Gump' writer Eric Roth is satisfied with producing a superficial historical tour bristling with platitudes. The big budget production is impressive in the special effects and makeup categories, but Fincher falls into the Hollywood trap of going for a gimmick rather than an idea, technique rather than art. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett diligently go through their paces as the lovers who meet in the middle (when both are roughly the same age) during a decades-long romance otherwise frustrated, both before and after, by Benjamin's oddity. But with three narrative voices pushing the relentless arc of devolution, most of the time the stars are only pawns in the conceptual game.Unlike several E.L. Doctorow protagonists not to mention Forrest Gump himself, this picaresque hero marches through history without getting into contact with major figures or great events. In fact he doesn't do anything particularly interesting. His button manufacturer dad (Jason Flemyng) thinks him a monster and after his wife dies in childbirth on the last day of WWI in 1918 drops the wrinkled, sclerotic infant on the doorstep of an old people's home, an appropriate enough home base for him, for the next decade or so anyway. He's adopted by the home's presiding spirit, Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). Queenie is a born again Christian and one of the movie's best scenes is a tent revival meeting where a black healer succeeds in getting the little shrunken Benjamin to hobble across the floor, then drops dead himself. (It's a colorful moment, but it doesn't build into anything.) Later Benjamin is spied by young Daisy (who will grow up into Cate Blanchett), who takes to him even as a gnarly little old man on crutches. Mr. Button senior hovers in the background and assists in Benjamin's first sex and first drink when he's aged back young enough to enjoy such things. Eventually he's sufficiently robust to go to sea and sticks to that long enough to be involved in WWII at sea--but as a survivor, not a hero.The frame tale is a hospital scene where a very cosmetically aged Blanceett lies dying in New Orleans on the verge of hurricane Katrina while her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) reads to her from Benjamin's diary. It really turns out that it's the expiring Daisy who has brushed with greatness. She was a dancer in her youth, the only American ever invited to perform with the Bolshoi Ballet, and Balanchine himself noted her perfect line. When a now more Brad Pitt-like Brad Pitt with a youthful face under wavy gray hair comes back from his long years at sea and looks up Daisy in New York, her conversation and friends are hip, but Benjamin, who tells somebody he's been 'nowhere, except harbors,' still seems a rube. His Louisiana drawl constantly suggests that he's slow on the uptake. In a brief affair with an edgy Brit diplomat's wife (Tilda Swinton) in Russia, he says virtually nothing. Ross and Fincher are pushing the empty vessel thing a bit too hard. Or is this maybe Andy Warhol in disguise? Pitt can be mad fun, as he was in his brief but memorable turns in 'Thelma and Louise,' 'True Romance,' and 'Snatch,' and his recent buffoonery in the Coens' 'Burn After Reading.' Or he can be bland and cloying, as in 'Meet Joe Black,' 'Seven Years in Tibet', or here. The Botox and cosmetic surgery fanciers' novelty of this movie is to wait for the moment when Brad finally reaches his own age, the forties, and then is cosmetically de-aged back to a gorgeous, sexy 'Thelma and Louise' charmer. But instead of having the con-man edge he had in Ridley Scott's movie, this time under his boyishly pretty makeup sheen he's just a dumb-looking adolescent. It's the movie's biggest disappointment, given that it only delivers in the visuals and effects categories, not as mature drama.For all its production values, this is just a workmanlike progression through the decades, and it quite lacks the hallucinatory beauty of Tarsem Singh's 'The Fall,' the one cinematic visual triumph of the past year. We've seen Blanchett in lots of prosthetics already before now. This time she even gets a prosthetic body, since somebody else does her ballet dancing for her. As for Pitt, he gets his head mounted on the top of a gnarly little man in a wheelchair. Ultimately 'Benjamin Button' doesn't excite in any category. As a picaresque tale it's a washout because its protagonist's adventures are so mundane. In the realm of thought it never gets above the level of saws like 'nothing lasts' and the reminder that aging, in either direction, can be scary--especially if sped up. Even in special effects and visuals it ultimately fails because its characters aren't interesting enough to care about. Oh yes: the prosthetics, CGI alterations and makeup are great. But the screenplay is a dud and the musical background reduces every scene to an even greater level of simpering sweetness than it has already.",7,28,51,27 December 2008
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Very bad rich people
","It should not be too hard to enjoy the new movie, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.' Rarely does the art house audience receive such a juicy piece of stuff as this gruesome Swedish serial killer mystery. The format is spruced up with a kinky investigator romance replacing Sherlock-Watson camaraderie. The background material, exploring which fills up most of the lengthy 150-minute screen time, is made up of shocker family history reaching back to nail big-time European industrialists as not only Nazis but sadistic criminals. This is as good a time as any for some very bad rich people. The investigative unreeling of the story, which comes from the first in a 'Millennium' trilogy of international bestsellers, has parallels with Fincher's splendid 'Zodiac.' The production values of this gory Swedish film are excellent and the acting is impeccable, starting with Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander. As the twisted little lesbian computer hacker with the tattoo and piercings and dyed-black punk hair who teams up with indicted yet charismatic investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), Rapace eagerly gobbles her role.There's only one trouble. 'Zodiac' is scrupulously faithful to lurid Seventies America criminology. Despite the detectives' ample use of up-to-date technology, 'Girl' just feels too much like old-fashioned Euro-trash fantasy. It makes the bad guys bad in every conceivable way, starting out with the offense of being mega-rich capitalists and moving on quickly to anti-Semitism and misogyny; the original film/book title means 'Men Who Hate Women.' The story line runs so far to sensationalism there's no room for complexity except of plot twists. You're well entertained if flaying, hanging, rape and immolation are recurrent fantasies of yours. But the reliance on showing gore and violence is unnecessary. It's different in a novel where one only imagines them. Director Oplev has overly jazzed Larsson's already hysterical catalogs of vice. Zodiac managed to be scarier without actually showing its serial killings, something Fincher learned between 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac.' You can't help feeling jacked around by Stieg Larsson's novel as director Niels Arden Oplev has transferred it to the screen. There's a certain irony in this, since Stieg Larsson himself was a genuine expert on racist hate crimes and right-wing conspiracies. However, he wouldn't be the first expert to tart up his information too much in molding it into fiction.Another reason for the film's unsatisfying aftertaste is that as so often with book (I won't say 'literary') adaptations, the movie suffers from the burden of conveying too much material in too little screen time. To begin with we're fed a lot of information. We learn that the dysfunctional, ultra-rich Vanger industrialist family is ripping off government funding to set up a fake business in Russia, and that the journalist Mikael Blomqvist, who publishes the magazine Millennium in Stockholm, has just lost a libel case brought by accused Swedish industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerström, which could cause Millennium to go down. In disgrace, Blomkvist agrees to be hired by Vanger, the aged former Vanger companies CEO, Henrik. The old man offers both to rescue Blomqvist's magazine and to supply him with proof of Wennerström's corruption. Blomqvist is officially to spend a year writing the Vanger family history, but the elderly Vanger wants him in fact to go back and solve the case of his niece's disappearance from the family's privately owned island 40 years ago. He's convinced a family member did away with the girl, and he trusts Blomqvist as a journalist -- and no doubt sees he's no publicist for the Vanger family.All that adds up to a pretty big dose of introductory exposition.When he comes to the island to work on the case, Blomqvist very quickly begins to see the connection of a series of country-wide murders stretching from the forties into the present. Meanwhile the movie simultaneously starts to fill us in on the story of the Dragon Girl. Evidently she was hospitalized for violent behavior earlier in her life and must still report to a state 'guardian.' When a new replacement comes he turns out to be an repulsive sex pervert who bribes and threatens Lisbeth while abusing her; then she gets ample revenge. These scenes are creepy, violent, and disturbing. Ingeniously, the plot brings Lisbeth and Blomqvist together by having Lisbeth hack into his investigation -- and contribute to it, when she has insights into the possible serial killing he has found.The fascination of Larsson's 'Millennium Trilogy' evidently arises very much from these two personalities, Blomqvist and Elsbeth, both complex and conflicted, who are gradually drawn together and even become a couple despite Elsbeth's violent, traumatic past and lesbian leanings. This has to be one of the more original detective couples. In contrast the stories of hate, rape, murder, and incest that emerge in the investigation seem at once excessive and conventional. Though we don't really learn quite as much as we'd like to about Blomqvist and Elsbeth's back stories, they still tend to seem more interesting and three-dimensional than the hackneyed catalog of vices served up for the Vangers. These Euro-trash megabucks folks veer into Hannibal Lector territory, but they're not clever or fiendish like Hannibal, just awfully, awfully nasty. The film ends with a resolution of the mystery that is pretty corny and pat, as well as once again breathless and overcomplicated. For the next 'Millennium' film -- and there's an American remake of Part I already planned -- I'll need more and better synonyms for 'lurid.' And I hope the filmmakers get hold of some better-formatted English subtitles. Of these, at least ten or fifteen percent were illegible.'Män som hatar kvinnor' (the Swedish title) was released March 19, 2010 in the US.",Null,3,8,28 March 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Elegant and intelligent
","Shown at the New York Film Festival, Lincoln Center, September 23, 2005.In his amusing first film 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,' which was scripted by master of illusion Charlie Kaufman, George Clooney -- whose own dad is a long-time TV anchorman -- dramatized the fanciful autobiography of kooky Seventies game show host Chuck Barris. This time he films real events, focusing on the conflict between much respected ultra-solemn CBS TV commentator and veteran newsman Edward R. Murrow and the dark prince of early Fifties communist-scare witch-hunting, Senator Joseph McCarthy. In the film, Murrow defends navy pilot Lt. Milo Radulovich, who's been kicked out as a security threat without being told the charges, and the pilot is reinstated. McCarthy, seen here only on actual vintage TV footage, accuses Murrow of being a communist sympathiser and Murrow rebuts. McCarthy is subsequently sued by the army and censored by the Senate so again Murrow has won the battle; but he loses the war, because CBS, then headed by the regal William S. Paley, soon phases Murrow out. The film looks very elegant with its rich black and white (blending with archival footage for McCarthy) heavily weighted to close-ups interspersed with jazz song interludes sung on screen by Dianne Reeves. The cast is led by an appropriately buttoned-down and chain-smoking David Strathairn as Murrow, with the director himself as Murrow's producer and right-hand man, Fred W. Friendly. The period atmosphere is spot-on. The overall effect is dry and a little self-important, and the result is a rather limited picture of the red-baiting period for viewers unacquainted with the overall history. But this is nonetheless one of the most intelligent and politically serious American pictures of recent years. Clooney's an amazing fellow: handsome, urbane, and witty, he's got brains and taste and commitment. There's hope in such a man's being as well placed as he is, and promise in his future collaboration with Steven Soderbergh in the new joint production company, Section Eight.",9,2,4,17 November 2005
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Haunting ironies of a child with a Nazi father
","What if a boy whose father was a high ranking Nazi officer started looking in on a concentration camp, and befriended a Jewish prisoner his own age across the fence? That's the premise of this English film shot in Hungary based on a bestselling young-adult novel by Irish writer John Boyne.The film shows events primarily from the point of view of the eight-year-old Bruno (Asa Butterfield). He and his mother and older sister are swept away by his ambitious Father (David Thewlis) from their posh Berlin mansion when he gets a promotion. A big farewell party evokes all the creepy grandeur of Nazi power. Not all Bruno's family love it. Just the way Father descends the stairs and slowly returns the Heil Hitler salute radiates squishy moral dishonesty and greed. Bruno leaves friends and school with the family to live in an austere Bauhaus fortress in view of a 'farm.' That's what Bruno thinks it is. The people on the farm are peculiar, though. They all wear pajamas.Bruno's forbidden to go out back. But he's an explorer at heart, and he's also bored and lonely. Before long he's sitting on one side of the electrified fence and Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), a sqinty boy with shaved head and pajamas, is sitting on the other.This relationship--spurred by the innocence and tact of both boys--and the audience's awareness of what situation Shmuel is really in and what kind of place Bruno's father is really in charge of, create a powerful tension that is at the core of this heart-breaking tale. But it's what happens in and around the house that shapes our feelings. Bruno's teenage sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) listens to the tutor brought in to indoctrinate the two siblings with 'history' (Nazi propaganda). She puts up posters and photos in the bedroom and becomes a more and more enthusiastic Nazi, while Bruno ignores it all--he prefers adventure books--and focuses more and more on his meetings with Shmuel, his single, forbidden and hard to reach and therefore very special friend, to whom he brings food, questions, and a checker board.Bruno finds out a man named Pavel (David Hayman) working in the kitchen who bandages his cut leg used to be a doctor and thinks it an example of the oddity of adults that the man would give that up to peel potatoes.Gretel flirts with Lieutenant Kotler (Rupert Friend), a blond Arayan type in lieutenant's uniform who works at the villa and joins the family at dinner. But Father's questioning reveals that the Lieutenant's own father fled to Switzerland because he didn't like the way things were going, and Kotler gets in trouble for not reporting his father for that. A remark the young lieutenant makes reveals to Mother (Vera Farmiga) what the foul-smelling smoke from the 'farm' means, and she breaks down, and eventually demands that she and the children be sent back to Berlin. Lieutenant Kotler seems to overcompensate by being particularly brutal to Pavel, but he is sent to the front. Father's own mother showed her lack of sympathy for the Nazis at the going away party before the family moved. She refuses to come to visit. Bruno begins to question whether Father is a good man, as Shmuel says his is. He has tried to ignore the tutor's propaganda but he realizes that Pavel and Shmuel are Jews and that they're supposed to be enemies. At one point he betrays Shmuel, but he regrets it deeply and pays a great price to compensate. News that against his wishes Bruno's going to be taken away from his secret friend leads him to take more drastic action, leading to a shocking climax.The film, immaculately shot and subtle in its unfolding, reminded me of 50's classics like Carol Reed's 'The Fallen Idol' and René Clément's 'Jeux interdits' ('Forbidden Games)', haunting depictions of a father figure whose perfection becomes suspect and the twisted secrets the horrors of wartime force upon the very young. The idea of children's concealments becoming far more serious than they admit also suggests Andrew Birkin's amazing film version of Ian McEwan's 'The Cement Garden.' Herman and his gifted cast and crew--the settings are rich and impressive--are treading on virtually sacred ground with hardly a misstep. In their essential roles Asa Butterfield is a subtle young actor and Jack Scanlon is touching and real as his counterpart across the Holocaust divide.Beautifully done as it is, 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' risks at times seeming merely a conceit. In its rethinking of the War from a child of Nazis' privileged (because innocent) perspective it is somewhat contrived, as a young-adult book on such a special subject risks being. The finale, though harrowing, would seem far-fetched if it were not so sudden and overwhelming. This film hasn't the intensity and veracity of 'Fateless,' Lajos Koltai's Hungarian film based on Nobel winner Imre Kertész's autobiographical novel and screenplay about a teenager surviving concentration camp life. But on the other hand, this film, being all in English, strangely takes on an even more universal quality, and provides a unique experience full of dark ironies only the perky English voices and the generally comfy settings can evoke. For some of us the horror of the Holocaust seems exotic and remote. Wishful-thinking complicity in evil-doing is much closer to home.",9,6,11,1 November 2008
8 Mile," Powerful silences
","Those who are saying `8 Mile' shows a vanilla-ed Eminem may have a point: this movie introduces him to a non-rap audience just as `Wild Style' introduced us to hip-hop.  But those who say Eminem is sanitized here for mall viewing have an odd notion of language.  Perhaps his CD's contain more inflammatory material than is aired in this movie, but what gets said here is most definitely not for any suburban grandmothers who aren't stone deaf.It's surprising - admirable, really - how well Curtis Hansen and his crew keep track of the plot from scene to scene when not much of it seems to matter other than Rabbit's problems with his mother, Stephanie Smith -- Kim Basinger.  Bassinger is a blue ribbon southern white trash trailor park mom. You can't help feeling that with minor tweaking she could be the mother of a Grosse Pointe prep school boy, a lady whose problem was overspending instead of imminent eviction from a stinky trailor.  Bassinger makes trashiness look attractive, just as she made movie star decay attractive when Hansen directed her in `L.A. Confidential' six years ago.  Rabbit's problems with girlfriends aren't significant, though he has two of them, an ex and a new one. Both are delicious but primed for rejection.  Rabbit's closest relationships are with his emcee pal `Future' (played by an utterly charming and huggable Mikhi Pfifer) and his slightly retarded token white homie, Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones).But his closest relationship of all is with himself, as is clear from the first scene, where Eminem is doing rap gestures in the competition shed men's room, looking in the mirror, hearing his music in his head --and this is fine, because it's what a young man has to do:  get on friendly working terms with who he is.  The movie is about his going off to be on his own and give up his rowdy playmates to become a winner, and he walks off by himself in the final scene.  The comparison with Shakespeare's Henry IV isn't out of place.  The Shakespearean parallel was used explicitly for Keanu Reeves' character in `My Own Private Idaho' but the theme is really more central here. Eminem isn't a cold personality like Keanu Reeves in Van Sant's movie. He is close to his mates and they're always touching hands and gently hugging each other.  The hands and the hugs are one of the main images that stay with you after seeing `8 Mile.'Eminem as shown in `8 Mile' isn't totally motivated by his anger at all. His anger is very contained.  He seems able to turn it on and off at will and release it only when he needs it --  to trounce rap competition or throw out his mom's sleazy boyfriend.  It's his ability to control his anger that makes both Rabbit and Eminem winners.Eminem does have an authenticity about him that makes for a strong presence on screen.  Paradoxically he projects a powerful inwardness, so that his turning away from everybody makes his face jump out at us.  His effect is of authenticity, because he doesn't put on a reaction to please the audience or suit the scene, but he is always there, moving with the scene and in fact creating it.`8 Mile' isn't just a vehicle for Eminem.  It's too well made a movie to be that.  But without Eminem `8 Mile' wouldn't exist.  The only importance of the rapping contests emceed by `Future' is that first Rabbit shies away from them, and then he enters them and wins them.  You have to wonder how the rapper/actors feel who are in the movie only to be put down by Eminem.`8 Mile' cannot escape from the limitations of the fictionalized star biopic.  There have been dozens of movies about emerging music stars and their families, their early sponsors, their first big breaks, and so on, many of them with more range and specificity of detail than this one. This movie only takes its hero to the moment when he walks away, having shown that he can be a star.  The whole focus is on his personality, and in particular his stillness.  The most important moments are those when Rabbit/Eminem stands with mike in hand, silent, waiting for inspiration to strike.  Even when he choses not to compete and hands the mike back, this moment is full of power.  In this movie Eminem carries the expression of sheer imminence, raw potential, to a new level of clarity and confidence.This rapper is good just standing there.",Null,121,145,11 November 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The key to the treasure is the treasure
","The ample fun and excitement Kill Bill provides don't result from the fact that it's `about' anything, that its characters have motivations, or that its plot makes sense, but from the way it takes us deep into movies. And, in doing so, it also takes us deeper into the peculiar movie-loving mind of Quentin Tarantino. There are endless references to other movies, most of all the Shaw brothers and Bruce Lee and other martial arts extravaganzas and Sergio Leone. Perhaps more interestingly, since this is the first Tarantino effort where he lets himself go again with his own writing (after the more disciplined exercise of adapting Elmore Leonard in Jackie Brown), Kill Bill contains endless references also to Tarantino's own more personal movies, and particularly to Pulp Fiction.Kill Bill's star is Uma Thurman, who above all is the most delightful, fun person in Pulp Fiction -- Mia Wallace, the wife of the awesome crime boss, Marsellus Wallace, and Vincent Vega's (John Travolta's) dangerous dream date. Don't think for a minute that there's none of Mia Wallace in The Bride/Black Mamba, Uma's role in Kill Bill. When Black Mamba comes to life and begins the chain of revenges Kill Bill chronicles after being teased by a mosquito into awakening from a four-year coma, she pops up exactly the same way Mia did after she got the hypodermic needle of adrenaline to the heart. It's a direct visual echo.Of course, Kill Bill is a homage to a different kind of pulp, and it hasn't got the amusing dialogue Pulp Fiction has. But we can see the same thought processes at work in the way Kill Bill is put together. There's a prologue (equivalent to the diner holdup scene with Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth) that begins Pulp Fiction, which leads into the background of the wedding murder scene with its stylized Wild West imagery and Sergio Leone overtones.From then on Tarantino thinks in big setting/action blocks: (1) the hospital sequence where Uma comes to and takes charge of the Pussy Wagon we saw her using in the prologue; (2) the Samurai sword/Sonny Chiba Okinawa sequence where Black Mamba gets her magic, invincible weapon; and finally, (3) the long Tokyo sequence. This is divided into four parts. a) two background sequences on O-ren Ishii/Cottonmouth, first (a) one distanced by discrete anime where we witness O-ren being turned into a killer as a child by being attacked by a pedophile grandparent, second (b) a scene of her with her Yakuza subordinates where she beheads one who objects to being led by a woman who isn't even pure Japanese. This is followed by the two big final sequences of (c) the interior of the restaurant/disco/nightclub where Uma/Black Mamba confronts O-ren's posse and wipes them out, and (d) the exterior snowy garden where she takes on O-ren herself and Vol. 1 comes to a astonishingly peaceful and beautiful end.It's not only the higgledy-piggledy time sequence that has a lot in common with Pulp Fiction: there are more specific echoes. Besides the 'awakening' of Uma, the showdown `in medias res' between Uma and Vernita Green/Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox) which serves as a prologue feels strangely similar to the Kahuna-burger sequence with Travolta and Jackson, the exploded head in the car, and The Wolf (Harvey Keitel) calmly supervising the tidying up of the bloody vehicle at Jimmie's (Tarantino's) house in Toluca Lake. In each case, it's ultra-violence abruptly breaking out in a bland, mediocre suburban setting as professional killers take revenge, with interruptions for brief spurts of terse dialogue. And the blank reaction of Copperhead's pretty little daughter to the mayhem and her mom's extinction reminds one of the small boy in Pulp Fiction who gets the long narrative from Christopher Walken about his grandfather's watch. Kids in Tarantino-land are innocent victims and affect-less onlookers.
Others may delight in the faultless choreography of Tarantino's martial arts sequences. For me the hospital sequence stands out even more brightly. Here again there are elements that rhyme with Pulp Fiction, because the way Uma's character brutally punishes the crude orderly who's been renting out her inert body, stabbing him and bashing his head repeatedly with the door when he falls, and the way she then painstakingly escapes to the Pussy Wagon and rids her nether limbs of `entropy' by sheer patient power of thought, recalls the patient, methodical Butch in the prizefight Zen/Maynard pawnshop sequence, retrieving his watch, escaping his tormentors, freeing Marcellus Wallace to revenge his sexual assault by `getting medieval' on the hillbilly pervert's ass, and then returning to Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) on the commandeered `chopper' -his `Pussy Wagon.'Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is more highly stylized and ritualized homage than Tarantino has ever done before: it's interesting that the greater artistic freedom and budget he has this time has led him, in a way, to restrict himself more.The movie's idiosyncratic plot sequences fit in with Tarantino's mentality as described in Larissa MacFarquhar's excellent New Yorker magazine article, `The Movie Lover' (October 20, 2003); she emphasizes that Tarantino has an incestuous familiarity with an almost endless quantity of beloved pulp movies. Favorite movie sequences exist in the cyberspace-like limbo of Tarantino's insatiable visual memory as if he had a head full of videotapes hanging half spent and never needing to be rewound. Somehow, somewhere, his plots all mesh, but it's the furiously engaging set pieces that stand out both in his mind and in the movies he makes.Tarantino is a `movie lover' and there's no irony in his homages. `The problem with the irony charge' against Tarantino, MacFarquhar says, `is that pop culture and life are not separable for Tarantino.' Therefore any homage to pulp is a homage to movies and a homage to life. That granted, Kill Bill becomes life affirming - and also art-affirming. `What is Kill Bill about? is an irrelevant question. The key to the treasure is the treasure. Statements to the effect that Kill Bill is `smart, but.thin' (J. Hoberman), `brilliant' but containing `no story' (Ebert), or worse yet `decadent' and `crap' (Denby) miss the movie's affirmative aspects and try to make it seem cold when it's bubbling with enthusiasm and joie de vivre.",Null,0,0,21 October 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Slick unease: Tim Burton's beautiful but nasty Roald Dahl remake
","'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' may be disquieting but isn't as creepy as you'd think from the parallels people have drawn between Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka and Michael Jackson. Parallels there are, mind you. Willy is of feminine appearance, with wig-like straightened hair, sickly smile, and too-perfect, unnaturally pale face. He lives in a preserve that's Neverland-like, the chocolate factory he's done over to resemble a candy jungle. Big difference: he doesn't like little boys -- doesn't like children at all.If Tim Burton's Willy Wonka isn't quite Michael Jackson, who is he? For one thing, like Edward Scissorhands (in his first appearance he's got giant scissors in his hand) Willy's a remarkable misfit who can't relate to ordinary people. If you're feeling ordinary, this typically beautiful but strange motion picture from Tim Burton may arouse mixed feelings. Its initial sense of order and logic turns to unease when Depp's Wonka appears. After a while the whole elaborate spectacle wears out its welcome as its little initial core of warmth goes cold. Not so different from many a classic children's story, I guess, it's full of terror and random cruelty. And like so many of those, it sprints to a happily-ever-after finale that leaves our unease unresolved.Ostensibly the story celebrates a happy family and offers hope to victims of bad ones. Willy's a sad adult who can't pronounce the word 'parent' but is saved at the end by regular dinners at Charlie's house -- becoming a partial member of the loving little household. Despite such poverty they've had to live on cabbage soup, Charlie chooses unhesitatingly to remain with mum, dad, and all four grandparents, who sleep together, the grandparents do, in one bed in the center of the little gingerbread house.Willy -- in flashbacks not in Dahl's story -- is seen with dentist father, made to wear a hideous cage on his head slightly exaggerating the orthodontic braces once actually used. Dentist dad forbids all sweets, and Willy becomes obsessed with them.Wonka's become a huge success in business by leaving home early, and it's an understatement to say he's a genius inventor. He works miracles. Adapting the children's tale, Burton deals only in superlatives. Everything is the best, the most, the most typical. The chocolate factory is the biggest in the world by a multiple of hundreds.The factory's been closed for twenty years but still mysteriously produces vast quantities of universally coveted sweets. What happened to all the townspeople left unemployed by the official closure? The movie doesn't tell, except that Charlie's grandfather is bravely poor, in his cozy bed. Five golden tickets are randomly planted to allow five children to visit the secret factory -- this, it turns out, is to find an heir -- or, as the joke is, a hair, because discovering one gray one during his biannual haircut made Willy realize he needs somebody to take over the factory when he grows old.The movie's based on the old-fashioned moralistic concept of good vs. bad character. Except for Charlie, each of the other children with golden tickets is dominated by an evil trait: gluttony, snobbery, ambition, or pride. Charlie alone is loving, modest -- and nice. Freddie Highmore of Neverland, who works with Johnny Depp again playing Charlie, has a sweet spontaneity that makes Charlie's goodness likable and real.The factory setup and the ranging of children types is marked by stereotyping and even racism, beginning with the fat orly-poly German family with their gluttonous son whose father runs a sausage shop, and continuing with the snobbish English people, the technology-mad Americans and the obsessive, competitive American females with the mother who pushes her daughter to win prizes in meaningless things. She's going for a Guinness record for longest time chewing the same piece of bubblegum. Strangest and most perverse of all, Willy Wonka has brought little creatures from a country where they adore coca to be his slave workforce -- the Oompa Loompas -- who're all clones of the same tiny Indian man (Deep Roy) -- a model of at-home outsourcing, perhaps. The conceit is as astonishing as it is weird. Burton has his nasty cake and eats it too, because the less likable children are done away with at first, and then brought back and allowed to leave the factory, if somewhat the worse for wear.There's a song and dance routine done by the Oompa Loompas at each of the bad children's moments of downfall and it's pointed out early on that this means Willy had everything planned. But he pretends his worker-entertainers are just good at improvisation. The very idea of such a thing in such an elaborately staged movie is a huge joke. Tim Burton is the most calculating of cinematic artists, and a master of high kitsch.Particularly disturbing is the way the spoiled child of James Fox's snobbish English nut factory owner (Julia Winter) is attacked by dozens of squirrels and she and Fox are thrown down a tube to be smothered in weeks-old rotting garbage. The chewing-gum girl's fate, being blown up into a huge ball and turned blue, and the technology boy's, being shrunk and then stretched wafer thin, or the German kid's, being jammed into a chocolate-filled tube, aren't really any nicer; in fact their damage is more permanent. Depp's pronounced American accent is a curious inconsistency. He did manage a good Scottish one for 'Neverland.'It's a happily incestuous crew. Depp has worked with Burton famously before, and Depp has worked with Freddie Highmore, and Helena Bonham Carter's a Burton regular who's back with Depp as his dead bride in Burton's coming delight, 'Corpse Bride,' which will also feature Oompa Loompa Deep Roy.There's no doubt Tim Burton has a gift for the menace and unreality of children's literature, but 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' for all its miraculous perfection, is an indigestible confection.",Null,0,1,4 August 2005
Black Hawk Down," One of the most impressive bad war movies ever made
","Black Hawk Down could indeed have been one of the best war movies of all time - if it weren't so mindless, numbing, and demoralizing.  Ridley Scott's new movie about the failed US action in Somalia certainly is one of the most exceptionally vivid and detailed cinematic depictions ever of an extended sequence of combat in all its horror, futility, and suffering. But this depiction unrolls without sufficient context or point of view. As I watched it, I kept thinking of the forgotten German Sixties film, The Bridge (Die Brucke).  In The Bridge, a similarly futile and murderous, though smaller scale, combat sequence becomes a devastating indictment of war; but significantly, the Bridge begins with a long background sequence on all the young soldiers' lives before combat.  That doesn't happen here, nor does the movie take a position on war. I realize Scott followed Mark Bowden's historical account of the events of 1993 and has sought to represent the events `accurately.'  But is it `accurate' not to comment on the fact that this was an effort to relieve famine, and all it ultimately did - despite the success of the operation (because it was a success, though people call it `disastrous') was kill off a thousand men, women, and children of the country as well as eighteen American soldiers?  Ridley Scott's visual spectacle with its chaos and accurate war machinery isn't enough.  A movie about warfare has to do more than present a spectacle of violent action. It has to provide a context and present a viewpoint that takes sensitive account of the people and events it depicts - which in this case would be a whole lot more than the insane little message, `we're good guys and we're heroes, even when we lose,' that the movie leaves us with.  Since this is the story of a huge snafu, an operation badly botched from above that the soldiers salvaged at great loss to themselves, the movie would also have benefited from some of the brilliant ironies David O. Russell brought to the Gulf War in Three Kings, but Black Hawk Down unfortunately is a film without irony and almost without humor, with its violent close-up action so intense and constant, with its personalities so sketchily dramatized, that it actually becomes boring at times.  And that's as cruel to the people depicted as it is to us.  To go through 144 minutes of grueling action and learn nothing is deeply depressing. Young actors like Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, and Orlando Bloom do their very best to give soldiering a human face.  So do more mature ones like Tom Sizemore and Sam Shepherd.  But it seems the camera and the equipment and the special effects are the real stars.  This is not entirely surprising coming from Ridley Scott.  Scott has done a few great, even classic, films:  Alien,  Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise.  But he hasn't always scored a win and he has never been noted for subtlety. Last year's Gladiator was much more interesting than this, but still highly overrated. This time he has used a very blunt instrument to dissect an enormously complex subject of contemporary warfare and American foreign policy and he has created a spectacular disappointment.",Null,4,7,20 January 2002
The Dark Knight," The Joker wins
","The new Batman film is out and it has triumphed as only a blockbuster can. It has made more money in less time than any other American mega-buck movie before it. It has brought the audience to its knees. Something approaching $200 million (enough to make 100 French art films) got spent on it, but soon the expenditures will be recouped. Wow. Good job, Chris Nolan.'The Dark Knight' tears up the screen. Villainy, as embodied in the triumphant and voluptuous posthumous performance of Heath Ledger as The Joker, so spills over Gotham that it seeps into the hearts and minds of the leaders of the Good Guys. That's what they mean by 'Dark.' Gotham is No Country for Old Men.What's happening to superheros these days anyway? Hancock (Will Smith) is a foul-mouthed drunk who causes major damage. The new Batman movie raises the issue that vigilante justice, even meted out by a chiseled millionaire with glowing skin, encourages lawlessness and may over all be a Bad Thing. The Joker is a sadistic lord of misrule. He has serious childhood issues, but he only uses them to tease and torment people ('know how I got these scars?'). To hell with money, he says, setting fire to a two-storey Step Pyramid of bundles of cash--prompting thoughts of the drooping dollar, Bush's war, and the way Hollywood throws money at a franchise like this one. His pleasure is all in sowing the seeds of chaos. And it's his movie. We don't see that much of Batman, or much other than his masked face, and the Joker is just way more fun to watch.Ledger-The-Joker tears apart the movie, too--yet seems sometimes all that's holding it together. Punctuated by his appearances, The Dark Knight barely comes to life till he shows up twenty minutes in, then is shaped by his always-flashy and riveting turns. But the movie is troubled by its own chaos. It's too long, and grows increasingly incoherent toward the end.Noise is pervasive, urging the audience to be excited from the first frame. This is always a problem with any film, especially a very complicated one like this: if you start out at too high a pitch, it'll be hard to sustain that and if you do sustain it, you risk wearing out the audience. Contrast the 'Bourne' movies. They're pitched high, hard and fast, but they're essentially simple chase stories with the hero in nearly every scene so they hold momentum easily. 'The Dark Knight' has us following too many different forces, and who's aligned with what gets too blurred. DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhardt), Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale), the DA's new--and Bruce Wayne's old--girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllanhaal), Wayne/Batman's loyal sidekicks Fox (Morgan Freeman) and Alfred (Michael Caine)--the latter two film idols who grab the screen and create a void around themselves (they're shot that way too). There's also police lieutenant Gordan (Gary Oldman), perhaps the least interesting yet nearly the most important character, and a mayor (Nestor Carbonell) with huge eyebrows and black-rimmed eyes. Except for the loyal sidekicks it's hard to know which way some of these people are going to go but they're all vying for the audience's distracted attention.And then there is the further major distraction and overkill factor of the gadgetry, the weaponry almost everybody has in his hand, the Bat-suits the thuggish-heavy Batmobile--virtually indestructible, like some giant prehistoric beetle, and the Lamborghini, whose smashup was, for me, the film's saddest moment. What a beautiful thing! It cost hundreds of thousands to custom-make, and then they run other vehicles into it and put big dents in it. That's a blockbuster. It destroys all in its path. It burns up pyramids of money.Then also you've got sonar or radar or something in cell phones and tanks of gasoline, and dynamite and flame-thrower weaponry. Little things with blinky lights, a match, anything will do: The Joker likes to blow up things. And if you like to see explosions and fires and hospitals collapsing and cars and trucks flying through the air spectacularly (and pretty convincingly) this is your movie.If you like dialogue, it may not be. Voices get muffled in the noise and Christian Bale talks in a hoarse whisper as if he's trying to turn into Darth Vader but needs more amplification. Here again Heath Ledger stands out, and so does Maggie Gyllenhaal. They both speak their lines not only expressively but clearly and distinctly. Aaron Eckhardt gets to wear some pretty elaborate makeup. He, like Maggie, is a good addition to the series: she offers heaps of believable personality and his square jaw is made for a comic book hero. He could play Dick Tracy. He seems a long way now from Neil LaBute. And I'm sorry, 'The Dark Knight' lectures us an awful lot for a big budget action movie, about good and evil and law and order and stuff, but it's a long way from meaning anything--except that it's a terrible shame Heath Ledger had to die. He dives into and romps with this role. It's scary fun. He had much pleasure to give us. He was just beginning. The Joker rules.",8,7,15,21 July 2008
Into the Wild," One hell of a young man
","Sean Penn's 'Into the Wild' is a passionate and faithful evocation of Jon Krakauer's book about Chris McCandless. It's the troubling and complex story of a young idealist and seeker who was also a rebellious child and beloved brother who gave away his $24,000 savings to Oxfam after college, went off in an old Datsun and left his family behind, and disappeared for two years wandering the country, only to be found by hunters dead of poisoning and starvation in an abandoned bus in the wilds of Alaska.It's been said as a criticism of Penn's movie that it isn't as neutral about McCandless as Krakauers's book. It is true that Emile Hirsch as Chris, who called himself Alexander Supertramp on the road, is such a joyous and appealing character it's hard to focus on the arbitrariness and foolhardiness of the young man. Hirsch gives his all. He has shown his knack for playing bad good boysparticularly in 'Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' and 'Lords of Dogtown'and for playing wild misfitsin the little seen 'The Mudge Boy.' This is the first great role he's had, and he deserves it. His work is a wonderful melding of 'negative capability' and generosity. It comes naturally to him to embody exuberance, boldness, and joy. If there was something off-putting or stern in the real-life McCandless, it's not very noticeable in Hirsch. But Hirsch's enthusiasm makes sense of the great adventure and self-discovery this story recounts. (Sadly, McCandless never seemed more ready to embrace life, and to overcome all his doubts about people and family, than right near his end.) All the faults McCandless had and mistakes he made made are there in the story as Penn tells it; if he has altered facts (and necessarily left some out), he hasn't done so to make the young man's plans seem clearer or his choices wiser, and the movie is replete with specific detail.'Into the Wild,' true, is itself a little on the wild and loud side, with its occasionally obtrusive Eddie Vedder soundtrack, it's insanely vivid characterslike the young Danish couple on the banks of the Colorado, Vince Vaughan's intense, grinning grain farmer, Hal Holbrook's fabulously sad, shut-down old widower. There is another kind of overload in the occasional use of split screens. But it all unfolds very much as Jon Krakauer's book does, with interludes at the 'magic bus' where Chris met his doom constantly intercut with episodes from his travels earlier during his two wander-years. And incredible episodes they are: roaming with a warm hippie couple; illegally and hair-raisingly running the Colorado rapids in a kayak; working in the big grain elevator and loving it; riding the rails and loving that too, till he's caught and beaten; escaping a flophouse in L.A.; staying with old Mr. Franz (Holbrook), learning from him how to engrave leather belts and persuading him to climb a mountain; and then off into the hostile snow country with a big back pack and sheer will. Many voiceovers from Chris's sister add more about the sibling relationship than was in the book; the family 'fearlessly' cooperated in the film-making. McCandless's stern NASA honcho dad (William Hurt) and uptight mother (Marcia Gay Harden) are as unappealing as he saw them, but are not overdrawnor underrepresented. Among other things Sean Penn's film is a remarkable balancing act.It's obvious this story had to be made into a movie, and it's hard to imagine how anyone could have done it better than Penn and his fine cast. All Penn's directorial efforts have been heartfelt and earnest, but this of his films thus far is his greatest artistic success and has the widest appeal. Into the Wild is a good balance of the emotionally wrenching and the thought-provoking. It contains so many themes and poses so many questionsabout youth, about time, about responsibility. Chris isn't to be confused with Herzog's 'Grizzly Man'. He's aware of the danger of nature. It's just that he has the hubris of daring to approach it with too little knowledge and experience, knowing the risk, and taking it. And indeed he might have made it and gotten back out, but for two or three terrible mistakes. Nature is unforgiving.Chris McCandless was unforgiving too. But if he read the romantic Bible of his own life lived in those intense two years and lived to tell of them, the film suggests, he would have learned to love and forgive. He was bright, talented, passionate about life, a seeker or rare moral fervor who read and thought and recorded all that happened in those last days. His death was sadly premature. But there are signsthey're clear in Krakauer's bookthat he made an impact on the world he inhabited and the people he met. Vince Vaughan's character shouts, 'You're one hell of a young man. You're one hell of a young man!' He died terribly alone. But maybe the tree that falls in the forest is heard after all. 'Quant'e' bella giovanezza,' goes an Italian renaissance verse, 'Che si fugge tuttavia.' How beautiful is youth, which flees straightaway. McCandless' story embodies those lines.'Into the Wild' seems more moving and thought-provoking than any other recent film, and may be destined to become some kind of classican 'Easy Rider', some have said, for our times. It's about society and nature, about family, about idealism and aloneness; most of all it's about the dangerous, heartbreakingly brief and beautiful romanticism of youth. In those two years, Chris McCandless lived a whole, remarkable, life. And Sean Penn has captured those two years for us.",9,81,131,22 September 2007
Blood Diamond," Damn the accent  full speed ahead!
","Blood Diamond gathers many strains, but the two main ones involve self-styled Rhodesian mercenary Danny Archer (Leonardo di Caprio) and fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou). Vandy's village is wiped out in the violence of Sierra Leone's civil war and, separated from wife and children, he's spared on-the-spot execution but forced to work in a diamond mine  in the open air, but guarded by men with guns who shoot to kill. Somehow nonetheless he finds a huge 'pink' diamond that he manages to hide. In the chaos of the war Solomon's son Dia gets turned into a boy soldier. The minute Solomon hides the big diamond he's imprisoned, but Danny gets him out because word of the find has spread through Soloman's brutal boss, also in the jail. Danny and Solomon are now linked: only Solomon can retrieve the diamond, but he needs Danny to get it to the buyers. The two men have many adventures together in which Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connolly) a journalist, becomes involved because she can get Solomon and Danny into and out of places through her press credentials and she wants a payback from Danny for her help: names and lines of power in the diamond smuggling business he's involved with.Edward Zwick's film is quite simply an adventure of character  with a background of violent African civil war and corrupt economics in which the African people are exploited by the rich white men who still run the world. Danny is a hardened man who has seen everything and shifted from any pretense of fighting for politics or ideas to things. He uses a weapon when he needs to, which in a country under civil war is pretty often, but smuggling gems to Liberia is his focus now and he does it for an unscrupulous company that deals in 'conflict diamonds' -- ones with an ugly background because they've been traded to buy weapons. 'In America it's bling bling,' Danny says, 'but over here it's bling bang.'Di Caprio's character is a burnt-out case at thirty-five, stripped of values but with enormous toughness, resiliency, and survival skills. He has a noble, stoical finale worth of the best Hemingway hero, as played by Bogart or Peck or another of the great Hollywood male icons. Still short of thirty-five, playing a role so rich and attractive any actor of his talent would have been a damned fool not to take it on, Di Caprio shows here if he hasn't before that he has left the reedy boy behind and grown definitively into adult parts. If the actor's accent is obvious or inaccurate as some say, it just doesn't matter. Such comments must be based on the trailer. The action doesn't give you time to think about accents.Di Caprio's face is lined, with a wry grin that reminds you of Orson Welles. He's forever puffing on a cigarette ('They'll kill you.' 'Only if you live.') and swigging liquor, able to catch and kill and skin a monkey for food at the drop of a switchblade. He and Jennifer have a tough-guy tough-gal romance. Both their characters are without illusions. Danny resists Maddy's prying, Maddy his manipulations. Each comes to admire the other's panache. ('You were good today.' So were you.') As Solomon Vandy Hounsou is the noble African, loving but heroically strong, able to endure anything to reunite with his wife and kids and tame Dia into becoming a son again and not a boy killer. Breathless as its narrative is, Blood Diamond has plenty of intense emotional encounters; its ability to find the time for both action and feeling is what makes it a great movie. The most emotionally powerful moment is nothing between Danny and Maddy, but the time when Solomon begs his son to accept him again and return to being a boy in a family.As for critiques of the film as demeaning to Africans or inaccurate about its economic and political background, they smack of the foregone conclusion, and show little attention to what's in the film or what it's trying to do. If you want a documentary you will go elsewhere; you'll be lucky to find as unbiased and wide-ranging an analysis, or as palpable a picture of what Africa at war today is like. The focus here is on how men and women function under pressure. The specifics of background are intelligent, but not the main point.The picture also has balance in the way it informs us but does not lecture us. The boy killers and conflict diamonds and mercenaries, the burned villages and amputated hands and the million-strong refugee camps that the world forgets, the smuggling and the diamond companies that buy up and store gems in vaults to keep up the price of what they sell (that will include the huge one, which they pay only two million pounds for)  these are all facts that enrich the background of an intelligent and up-to-date but essentially old-fashioned adventure story. This feels like a real movie. Call it a popcorn movie. It's not art house stuff. But like some of the best cinema or drama or literature, it can be appreciated and enjoyed on many levels, by audiences ranging from naïve to sophisticated. It's very well made and very well conceived. Good for Zwick and everybody concerned!",9,0,0,18 December 2006
Pride & Prejudice," It's fun but it's not Jane Austen
","'Pride and Prejudice (1940) -- This literate movie is a reasonably faithful transcription of Jane Austen's sparkling comedy of manners. . .but when Jane Austen's characters are brought to life at M-G-M, all is changed -- broadened. Animated and bouncing, the movie is more Dickens than Austen' That's Pauline Kael on the 1940 Laurence Olivier, Greer Garson version with 'that great old dragon Edna May Oliver, as Lady Catherine.' Kael's description of the 1940 movie works pretty well as a template for the new Keira Knightley-Joe Wright Pride and Prejudice. This time the 'old dragon' is Judi Dench. We can't say Wright's version belongs to Darcy, because it hasn't got Olivier: Mathtew MacFayden is strong enough, but no Olivier. The movie belongs, as it should, to Elizabeth Bennett, and hence to the charming, pretty Keira Knightley. It's also, like the 1940 one, 'changed -- broadenedanimated and bouncing.' 'More Dickens than Austen' won't work, and the recent critic exaggerated a bit who said this new movie is Austen 'Brontëfied,' and so did the one who called it 'a film that turns Jane Austen's nimble satire into a lumbering Gothic romance.' But they're all onto something -- something that's not there.Not quite Brontëfied or Gothic, this new Pride and Prejudice has definitely been romanticized, and more than that it's had the essential elements of Jane Austen taken out. Austen's elaborate irony and rational thinking, and most of her beautiful and elegant sentences -- the essence of her books -- are all excised in favor of bouncy dancing and vivid color photography and nice-looking people -- very nice-looking ones, with nice period clothes, who more often than not overlap voices Altman style or just interrupt each other.And since we don't have to hear all that's said, the gaps are filled in with surging strings and powerful piano music, music no instrument in 1821 could have come close to matching. These movie ladies sit down to their little period pianofortes -- and out comes Jean-Yves Thibaudet playing a modern Steinway concert grand. True, Jane Austen lived at a time when a lot of the great classics were composed, but she lived in the country, far from a symphony orchestra, and it's unlikely she heard anything but a little Hayden and Mozart, maybe, and minor English composers and some Italian songs, all played on an instrument with a relatively very limited sound. And of course though the ladies may have been accomplished, they were not Jean-Yves Thibaudets.The looks are pumped up too, like the sound. The young men are all so handsome or cute the country balls come out looking like ads for Ralph Lauren or Abecrombie & Fitch. The economic levels are exaggerated, so you can't grasp the delicate details of income that are so important in Austen's novels. Lady Catherine's house is as grand as Buckingham Palace, and Darcy's is very nearly that grand. His estate as we see it here would easily have made him one of the half dozen richest men in England. His mansion has a huge sculpture gallery in it like a major room of the British Museum, and the other rooms are decorated with murals that look like the Vatican. At the other extreme, the Bennett girls' surroundings are taken from the Squire in Fielding's Tom Jones as represented in Tony Richardson's movie, with pigs coming into the house, and Mr. Bennett always, always, needing a shave.The irony -- there is one irony, though not in the movie -- is that you can't really make a movie of Jane Austen. Her books are easily visualized on film. Movie makers can come up with the costumes and the sets. But her books aren't essentially visual. They are meant to be read. They're all about prose style, and the turns of phrase that make one think, sentences that flow gently and come down easy, catching you unawares so you may have to read them again, sentences that delineate the development of character through thought and experience with infinite clarity and subtlety. On screen, that development is there, but it's visual. It just happens. The camera just focuses on Ms. Knightley, thinking. But in Jane Austen it happens with words. Ultimately that isn't cinematic. So you can't make a Jane Austen movie without taking out the Jane Austen. Why do people do it, then? Well, people just like to make movies of her books, I guess -- and people like to watch them.Joe Wright's film is fun, but it's not a masterpiece -- or Jane Austen. The directing largely isn't there, not in Jane Austen's terms: character development. Nobody really develops. Mathew MacFadyen is a young man who looks glum, and he looks that way all through. He doesn't really seem haughty and nasty at first, just like a man who can't dance. Keira Knightley is charming -- so is Simon Woods as Bingley, which is fine, because that's all he needs -- but she isn't sharp and she doesn't come through as a keen intelligence or a woman who is transformed. What Joe Wright's good at is getting a bouncy, sweaty bunch of good-looking people out on a dance floor in a stately home, and walking folks across pretty English landscapes. Walks in Jane Austen are about talk, or economics, like everything else. But in Joe Wright's film they're about sweeping strings and Chopin. Everybody is too nice, except the tiresome Mrs. Bennett -- though Brenda Blethyn is okay, not a caricature as some have said. My regret is that Donald Sutherland's smiley and weepy Mr. Bennett isn't drier and more ironic. Like everybody else in the movie, except Lady Catherine, he's been made likable, at the expense of Jane Austen's wit.",7,4,8,6 December 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The poetry of memory meltdown
","The nice thing about this collaboration between French video ace Michel Gondry and head-trip screenwriter Charlie Kaufman is that it's so sad and human. The sci-fi games and convoluted cleverness don't get in the way of a basic evocation of the messy, ambivalent end of an intense affair. Jim Carrey - more ordinary and believable than usual - and Kate Winslet - as vivid and beautiful as always - somehow emerge from all the stylized modernistic craziness looking and feeling very much like a painfully real couple of lovers.We don't know what the chronology is till later but it goes backward. The opening scenes of Carrey meeting Winslet in the Montauk train station have great vividness. She is too quirky and forward and he is too shy and hangdog. They fall in love. The centerpiece is a visit to a sleazy local brain mechanic who erases memories. Kate's character has already done it to eliminate Jim. He goes to end his suffering by having her excised. The conceit we are to accept is that while asleep or drugged for the brainwash Carrey's character has second thoughts and concentrates mightily to reverse everything. At the end we find that he hasn't quite succeeded. They've forgotten each other. But they manage to meet and fall in love a second time and that's the sequence with which the movie has begun.The story is nothing if not intricate. In its sequencing of scenes, it's arguably more complicated than any of Kaufman's other filmed screenplays. But the focus is on the simple, familiar experiences of lovers: falling, fighting, parting, second thoughts, trying to forget, trying to remember. The sc-fi part is a metaphor for all that.This package may be too tricky and scary to make a great date movie for the average couple, but anybody's memories of lost loves - and the longing to bring them back -- can very easily be teased out by watching Joel and Clementine's ordeal. In the filmmakers' neat blend of conceptual and emotional, tricky theoretical stuff is planted in your mind embodied in the busy succession of intense, funny-depressing everyday scenes. While we're watching events inside Joel's brain as he's in his bed being 'treated' by the Lacuna company's memory erasers, we see books and walls and even faces go blank as the erasing takes effect, while Joel and Clem frantically scramble away to save themselves from the faded memory and reassemble somewhere in the mind where the technicians won't look. It's a vivid evocation of how memories fade and how we struggle to keep emotions and images alive when a relationship has lost its freshness in real time.
The result is as clever as it is touching. The strong secondary characters, the amiable quack doctor played by Bill Wilkinson, the bespectacled technician Fink (Mark Ruffalo), the fawning secretary (Kirsten Dunst) and the assistant called Patrick who's trolling for Joel's girl (Elijah Wood) keep the love story from ever seeming solipsistic, or even beautiful. Or for that matter, even important: Joe's home brainwashing session, from the point of view of Fink, Patrick, and Miss Dunst, is little more than an occasion to engage in their own shenanigans. In a way these characters are like the buffoons that hover around the periphery of tragic heroes in a Shakespeare play to keep its doings from being too formal or too solemn for us groundlings.The Gondry-Kaufman collaboration is at least as effective as the Jonze-Kaufman and Clooney-Kaufman ones. But shenanigans aside, is it fun? More like pleasing torture, it seems. A message board contributor calls it 'a headache. A beautiful, inspiring, addictive headache.' Somebody else writes that `old people' (probably anybody over 40) `hate' the movie. `Young people,' who `love' it, get excited trying to figure it out. What tape was Joel throwing out of the car in that early scene? they ask. Does Clem pursue Joel differently the second time from the first? Above all, how could Clementine's message in a dream during Joel's brainwashing to `meet me in Montauk' work?You don't have to be young to love this movie, but you may have to be a bit naive to worry much over such questions. It's just a movie - and an unusually farfetched one - but what makes it so good is the way the couple's emotions feel so genuine throughout, not how all the story elements gibe. Some of them may not. Gondry confirms their reality memorably however by banishing Matrix gloss in favor of a conceptual world that's as drab and clunky looking as American Splendor's, but enriched by Kaufman's conceptual tricks and a surprising mix of humor and sadness. A superb film, and some of its stars' best work.  It's impossible to do justice to it in any description, though much good stuff has already been written.  Just see it.",Null,0,1,27 March 2004
Taken," Bad Bourne
","Ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) used to specialize in stopping bad things from happening--expertly, we're to assume. Now he's retired to California to be near his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). That's a project, because Kim lives with Bryan's not-at-all-friendly ex-wife Lenore (Framke Jenson), and a very rich and generous stepfather, in an L.A. palace. When he appears at a grandiose birthday party at the house for the girl, it's clear he's not very welcome.Kim wangles a trip to Europe with a girlfriend. Bryan, whose permission is required because she's only 17, doesn't like the idea at all. It ain't safe over there for a young American. Bryan's carer has taught him paranoia. He sees terrorists and perverts and all around bad guys everywhere, especially over in the Old Europe. Besides that, Kim is a virgin, and 17. Two essential setups for the plot, because giving his permission involves Bryan in the trip, and her being a virgin--well, see if your mind is paranoid enough to figure out what that means. Kim lies and begs and jumps up and down (Grace's performance consists mostly of jumping, acting terrified and comatose, then jumping again when it's all safely over). Bryan gives in reluctantly and signs a release.But boy, was Bryan right. The minute Kim and her girlfriend arrive in Paris, they're kidnapped. It happens, in the manner of modern movies, when she's on her cellphone talking to Bryan. Then he makes the speech that is repeated in the trailers in which he instructs her to hide under a bed, and then get caught. I guess she can't jump out the window, the way he could.And soon does, when he rushes over to Paris to rescue Kim and track down and on-the-spot execute the kidnappers. How he finds out they are Albanian slave traders and pimps and how he is in their lair threatening them in 24 hours or less is something you will more or less learn if you see the movie. Only more or less, because it's all a game, really, if a very violent one, and the connective tissue of the plot is frequently missing.'Taken' is an excellent thrilling nonstop adrenaline-pumping exhilarating movie starring the accomplished Neeson. It's also a dumb unbelievable bigoted collection of disgustingly cruel scenes whose heavy-handed setups show utter contempt for the audience's intelligence. That might seem what we deserve for going to such a film just because it stars a man who convincingly played Oscar Schindler and Alfred Kinsey, Rob Roy and Michael Collins. At fifty-seven (and looking every minute of it) he also might just be a bit old for dropping rooms-full of bloodthirsty Albanians and heavily armed Saudis, jumping from building to building and outwitting the Paris police force, were he in real life actually to carry out such exploits in the few days during which all this happens. If that matters. This dubious aspect to the casting of the lead merely starts off the list of stunningly implausible details. Following the gospel according to Daniel Craig (his image, that is), macho action stars don't have to be suave or good looking. Do they have to have the physical conditioning and stamina to make ultra-physical action plausible? The makers of the Bourne franchise movies think so. That's why they've wisely cast the very fit, muscular, and still young Matt Damon in the role. But this is bad Bourne. Very bad Bourne. Unlike the Bournes' Paul Greenglass, Pierre Morel proves to be an efficient but mechanical director with very little flair.You're not supposed to notice that casting incongruity. Neeson's a bit old for an action star, but he's still erect, tall (6'4', actually) and elegant. He carries himself with cool confidence. It all slides by fast--too fast, finally, to remember much but the despicableness of the villains and the ruthless murderousness of the avenging CIA agent/dad. Pierre Morel, a French cameraman and cinematographer who broke into directing with the crackerjack B-Hollywoodish Paris ghetto action flick 'District 13' ('Banlieue 13'), has teamed up again with Euro shlockmeister Luc Besson, made a good movie out of this--well, except for the dumb writing. Even in actioners, writing is important. Note the interesting identity theme that unites the Bourne stories and their inspired use of breakneck location shifts. Following the S/X-free style of Morel's Parkur sequences in '13,' 'Taken' doesn't have a lot of state-of-the-art fakery, though its car chase scenes come early and often and totally without dramatic necessity. Mainly, what damns the whole effort is that the storytelling in is crude and obvious and full of holes, and the thinking is nasty.This is a choice of which Neeson ought to be ashamed. And, as we shall see if we watch through to the end, it is another addition to Jack Shaheen's book 'Real Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People.' Because the Albanians are scumbags, but the absolutely most despicable villains are the Arabs at the end who actually purchase the young virgins to indulge their vile sexist lusts. But no matter: Bryan kills them ll, every one. He kills anybody who gets in his way too, even just people whose cars he needs for a chase scene. The mindless brutality of this film is, well, mind-boggling. And it all goes to reinforce jingoistic ideas that Americans are at war with 'evil', and more or less with all the rest of the world, and anybody who gets in their way, including the Paris police force. And all to protect our dumb naive spoiled teenage rich girl virgins.",6,2,3,14 February 2009
Avatar," Shock and awe: separating the beauty from the hype
","'Avatar' is a fancy word -- an appropriate one, I guess, for a movie that is both awesome and silly. As the movie explains, it's a Hindu term for the incarnation of a god on earth. But actually, just as in the recent movie 'Surrogates' (which Cameron was involved in) and 'The Matrix,' somebody is lying in a room all wired up while he or she is running a virtual second self doing stuff out somewhere. That's what an 'avatar' is. In 'Surrogates' the virtual selves are mainly just misbehaving. In 'Avatar,' we're on the planet Pandora, where a private corporation, RDA, whose boss, a pale nasty named for a British department store, Selfridge (Giovani Ribisi), is aiming to extract major quantities of a super-valuable mineral called (I said silly, remember) 'Unobtainium.' There's a bunch of gung-ho racist military earthling types headed by a Robert Duval substitute called Col. Quartich (Stephen Lang), ready to speed up this enterprise by blowing away the 'humanoid' locals, which they refer to as 'blue monkeys,' who're sort of sitting on the Unobtainium, in a lush forest. As in Duncan Jones' rather intriguing little movie 'Moon' (released in June), earthlings in 'Avatar's' world, set over a century in the future, have run out of terrestrial power sources and gone to outer space for new ones.There's an opposing group of culturally sensitive scientists headed by the ever-tough and soulful Sigourney Weaver (known here as Grace), who know better. They realize that the tall, thin, and yes, blue indigenous people of the region are in fact the Omaticaya clan of the Na'vi. Led by Grace, the scientists have been learning the Na'vi language and making friends with the Omaticaya -- winning the 'hearts and minds,' you know? They work with the Omaticaya in the form of 'avatars' that are tall, blue, skinny people like them. This allows them to 'pass,' so to speak, and make up for the fact that the air on Pandora is too thin to breathe. Meanwhile Quaritch and his boys are talking 'shock and awe' and 'fighting terror with terror.' Yeah, the references are as simple and schematic as that.There's a whole lot going on in Cameron's's 'Avatar' -- and at the same time not very much. It takes a while to explain the setup, but after that it's pretty simple what happens.Grace is very disappointed when Jake Sully arrives on Pandora. He's a Marine corporal sent to replace his dead twin brother, because he's got the right DNA to operate his brother's avatar, but while his brother was a scientist, he's just a jarhead who's been rendered paraplegic in a recent war. Jake's background makes him appeal a lot to Col. Quaritch, but Grace starts to like him when he takes so well to working his avatar that he connects right away with Omaticaya princess Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and is quickly adopted by her tribe. It's sort of an 'Emerald Forest'-cum-'Dancing with Wolves' situation -- Jake goes native. And he picks up a good speaking knowledge of Na'vi -- though the locals, due to Sigourney's teaching, tend to speak excellent English -- which might disappoint Professor Frommer of USC, whom Cameron engaged to invent a complete Na'vi language. There are speeches in Na'vi (with rather ornate subtitles, as if it were a medieval language), but the whole cultural thing is focused more on what we might call the neuro-spiritual element. Cameron has spent hundreds of millions of dollars and engaged thousands in making this movie, and the fun of it is, for a while anyway, in the elaborate way the details of Pandora have been worked out. Quaritch describes it as worse than hell, and the six-legged dino-horses, hammerhead rhinos, shell-covered snarling tigers, four-armed lemurs, and so on, as well as the little floating jellyfish creatures, are pretty challenging for avatar-Jake his first night in-country. But since he bonds with Neytiri right away (her name even sounds a bit like Tommy/Tommee's Amazon forest girlfriend Kachiri in 'Emerald Forest'), and learns to turn terrifying flying beasts into his docile steeds by connecting the end of his pigtail to their neural tendrils, Jake's avatar life becomes way more exciting than anything he's ever done before, and in a running video journal he keeps, he admits he's begun to forget what the rest of his life was even like before this.New York Times film critic A.O. Scott exclaimed recently that 'Avatar' is unusual as a blockbuster in that 'it doesn't come from a comic book, it doesn't come from a novel, it doesn't come from a line of toys, it comes from James Cameron's imagination.' Well, the material here is very much like lots of sci-fi novels (the kind I used to read as a teenager), comic books, lines of toys, and video games, so there's nothing so extraordinary about Cameron's imagination. What's extraordinary is the mise-en-scene, and the way 'motion-capture' is used to give the avatar's expressions and movements, and then they're digitalized to incorporate them in these rather sexy tall skinny figures with their rather corny Amerindian outfits and hairdos; and the elaborate flora and fauna of Pandora.Unfortunately it all ends in a noisy, protracted shoot-out that makes it like the dreadful, but intermittently atmospheric, 'Terminator: Salvation' -- which, lo and behold, co-starred Sam Worthington. Watching this, as the noise and explosions became steadily drearier and more familiar, I realized that Cameron's 'Titanic,' which I loved much more than this, mainly because it had real people and events in it, however romantically magnified, also went on far too long. There are things about 'Avatar' that are very fun, but the Na'vi, even at their sexiest, still look like plastic-y video game dolls, and those who declare this to be a cinematic spectacle that's wonderful beyond anything since 1915 and D.W. Griffith (David Denby in the same interview) are really falling prey to the hype.",8,4,12,18 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Not so scary
","Sam Raimi, of the 'Evil Dead' movies, detoured into comic book heroism with Spider Man. Working with his older brother and sometime collaborator Ivan on the screenplay, in 'Drag Me to Hell' Raimi returns to the horror genre but branches out into the supernatural with a tale of possession, curses, and exorcism. The result is a movie that has the potential of satisfying the general audience repelled by contemporary horror films so bloody and disgusting lately only adolescent males or their grown-up equivalent can stand them. 'Drag Me' has more elaborate, faster, louder effects than were available in the Seventies, but it's intentionally old-fashioned. It even opens with a prologue set in 1969 and cast in a deliberately garish B-picture style. In what follows, the scares have more in common with William Friedkin's 1973 'The Exorcist' than with the 2000's 'Saw' franchise, 'Cabin Fever' or even 'Friday the Thirteenth.' This is a vivid exercise in self-conscious but enthusiastic genre that for all its noise and yuckiness is is more enjoyable than unsettling.The first thing you notice is that the main characters aren't the attractive but despicable (and therefore disposable) youths Fred Krueger comes for, but people you can actually like. At the heart of this movie is a nice young couple, the plucky, winning and pretty Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) and her sweet, faithful boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long). Lindsay is a loan officer at a small bank. Appropriately enough in this time of the burst real estate bubble, Christine brings down a curse upon herself by refusing to delay a mortgage foreclosure.Raimi plays with the situation and our emotions here. The sick old lady who begs for a third extension, Mrs. Gannush (Lorna Raver), elicits Christine's (and perhaps our) pity at first, though Christine's need to impress her boss and win the vacant Assistant Manger post for herself makes her refuse to grant that extension. But the yellowish slimy drool from Mrs. Gannush's mouth, her hideous sharp discolored nails and her snaggly pointed teeth -- which, absurdly, are false, and which she removes to suck on some candy from Christine's desk while she's talking to the manager -- quickly tip us off that in fact she is -- ridiculously, over-the-top-- evil, doubtless a witch, put on this earth, or on Sam Raimi's set, to make Christine's life a nightmare and give us a lively, slightly scary, slightly gross ninety minutes in the theater. He avoids he whole issue of human sadism by focusing on an invading spirit, a 'Lamia,' that aims to torment and terrify, not torture or maim. Not for the first time, Raimi's sequences revel in their sheer absurdity, while skirting the edge between seriousness and play.* Mrs. Gannush has a menacing hissy fit when Christine turns her down, and has to be removed by security officers. Then she is waiting in that classic scary place of movies, an underground parking lot, to confront Christine. and launch the curse, which hinges on a coat button. I felt a little embarrassed for Lora Raver. She's not so much an actress here as a most unflattering object upon which special effects are hung.With all the whirring insects, dark winds, flying objects, and buckets of fake blood that follow, what anchors Raimi's movie and makes it watchable are the appealing human elements, which add a certain nuance uncommon in the genre. As Christine's boss Mr. Jacks, who controls her future, David Paymer isn't the bad guy we expect, but admirably fair. Her oily, devious competitor for the assistant manager position Stu (Reggie Lee) is greedy and devious, but also so pathetic you can't hate him. Similarly when former farm girl and nobody Christine goes to meet Clay's well-heeled parents (played by Chelcie Ross and Molly Cheek), their snobbism toward her surprises us by fading quickly, and they seem quite decent people -- till Christine's curse leads to behavior so appalling they're glad to see her to the door.Something makes Christine want to have her fortune told. In stories like this you've got to have a spiritual adviser. The Raimis made an excellent decision in choosing that this should be a man from India, land of deep spiritual lore. As Rhan Jas, who helps Christine find ways of appeasing the evil Lamia that's after her, Dileep Rao is warm and appealing.Finally Justin Long, whose online bio begins with the description, 'a likable, boyish-looking actor with thick eyebrows and a friendly smile,' is hard not to love.It's with these human touches that Raimi constructs an essentially grim, nightmarish, and by implication deeply pessimistic movie that feels surprisingly cozy. This is largely because it also feels old fashioned, evoking bygone movie-going experiences more than any scary realities. It's funny that so many teams of special effects guys were involved, given that none of it seems real for a minute. Raimi plays the game to the hilt, but he never stops letting us know he's in on the joke._____________________ *Kevin Lee's YouTube video discussion of Raimi's 'Evil Dead II' sheds light on the director's outlook and methods. 'If the Evil Dead movies have contributed one thing to our appreciation of film aesthetics,' Lee begins, 'it is to make us consider the boundary between what's funny and what's scary.' A pretty thin one, it appears.",8,1,3,20 June 2009
Grindhouse," Wasn't that some crazy b.s.?
","'Grindhouse,' as some of us have only recently learned, is a slang term for a now vanished kind of down-market movie theater that showed double features of B-pictures. Tarantino and Rodriguez have produced a long portmanteau of a grindhouse homage movie that's a double blast. Rodriguez gets the cheap effects down, including the missing reels and scratched up stock and poor continuity and over-the-top gore, while Tarantino better captures the kind of simple, crazy fun such movies used to provide. Rodirguez's Planet Terror anthologizes crap movie styles and looks to perfection with its combination of sci-fi and zombie elements. But it's Tarantino's second feature, a diptych of two stories about some ladies and a devilish stunt driver (Kurt Russell), that shows us what raucous, powerhouse pleasure such movies could provide.Rodriguez, who has produced his share of bad movies, may never have done anything better than Planet Terror, a gleefully energetic potpourri of needle stabbings, explosions, lopped limbs, and bubbling and pustulating faces from a bio-terrorist plague, with shootouts, barbecue recipe secrets, sheriffs, ghouls, and, famously, a lady (Rose McGowan) who loses a leg and has it replaced by a machine--gun. Rodriguez holds his hodgepodge together with a cadre of recurrent characters led by the surprisingly cool and charismatic Freddy Rodriguez as the heroic underdog gunman, 'El Wray'; but any lack of unity is okay because it's part of the evocation of a slapdash production whose parts don't fit together. And then there's the missing reel, which teasingly comes at the sexiest moment, as does a similar lacuna in Tarantino's Death Proof.Not only is Grindhouse a triumphant celebration of the fanboy nerdism, the videostore expertise that made Tarantino who he is; it's a way to share the fun, along the way weaving in a bevy of tasty babes that includes Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Rose McGowan, Vanessa Ferlito, Tracie Thomas, Rosario Dawson, and Marley Shelton. As a couple of those names hint, this is naturally a compendium of cult allusions that will make Grindhouse fun for nouveau fanboys to scrutinize and trawl for years to come. Packed with these, and hilarious, are the fake trailers for movies that never were, 'Werewolf Women of the SS', 'Thanksgiving', 'Don't,' and 'Machete', with an appearance by Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu in the Werewolf segment.In truth though its vividness engages, Planet Terror is ultimately a bit wearying. The real enjoyment comes in Death Proof, which celebrates Seventies hopped up American cars and the pre-CGI car battles with real vehicles and real 'dumb' (but skilled and bold) stunt drivers driving them in real death-defying crashes and races -- but also features vintage Taranntino dialogue, with its familiar challenges, salty talk, and shaggy dog elements. (There's plenty of computer use in both segments, notably to produce the effect of broken and damaged film footage, but also by Rodriguez to fake damage to bodies and defiance of the laws of physics.) The two parts of Death Proof overlap, because Kurt Russell is in both of them as an aging but still feisty stunt driver. In the first half he seems nice but turns out to be super mean. In the second, he starts out full of jackrabbit menace and winds up brought to his knees by the ladies he chooses to molest automotively. The formula is familiar from other Tarantino movies: violent action interrupted by long passages of ornate but irresistible chatter. What's interesting is to see how consistent the mix is, yet how fresh it seems. The conversations between real-life New Zealand born stunt double Zoe Bell, Rosario Dawson, Marcy Harriell, and Sydney Tamiia Poitier has as much rhythm and zing as any Tarantino talk thus far. The writer-director surely is still writing dialogue actors love to play. Yes, I called it a formula. In this context what's more appropriate? It still works. 'Wasn't that some crazy b.s.?' a young black man said to me enthusiastically as I walked out. It sure was.",9,0,2,10 April 2007
The Last Samurai," Be kind to your feudal friends
","It's easy enough to trash Edward Zwick's new movie.  You can say it's just another silly story of a white boy condescending to `natives,' and all too similar to Kevin Costner's slightly embarrassing and very much over-praised 1990 Dancing with Wolves.  The odyssey of Captain Nathan Algren  is both idealized and preposterous.  It can be seen as insulting, if you think all those Asians are just dying onscreen to make Tom Cruise look like a hero. It's awfully convenient that the main Japanese character is quite fluent in English even though he's a samurai warlord living in a remote village in the 1870's.  It's easy to argue that this is all ridiculous wish-fulfillment stuff; that it not so much tells a story as manipulates images and emotions, pursuing its fantasy of nobility in the face of modern, urban, westernized corruption. It's utopian racism, exalting an outmoded, aristocratic feudal code that was already long bankrupt by the time Algren came to it, and suggesting that Japan ought to have stayed out of the twentieth century.It's also easy to point out that Tom Cruise is unimpressive in physique and stature and lacks emotional power onscreen.  Indeed he's unconvincing as the drunken, burnt-out soldier he's supposed to be at the outset.But those who dismiss Tom Cruise in this role forget that he's Tom Cruise. Not only will millions of people go to see his movies, but his is a personality that exudes drive and charisma, while we either sense or actually know that there's something a bit empty and needy at the core of the man, and it's not just a question of missing Nicole.  It's therefore very believable that he would have the dedication to master sword fighting, gain his captor's respect, embrace the Bushido and be entranced with Japanese culture, with its emphasis on excelling at everything - and on hiding emotions! Anyone has to admit that Cruise is more than adequate at the technical, physical side of his part  -- he not only does his own sword fighting and stunts, but also does them sharply.  This isn't a movie that cheats the way Gladiator did:  in hand-to-hand combat, you see all the moves.  There's a logic to the physical action in every Last Samurai battle, large or small, practice or to-the-death, that's very satisfying.  The Last Samurai contains some of the best fight scenes ever.  Yes, Tom works a little too hard here, but it pays off in the fights.To condemn The Last Samurai's gaijin ethno-centrism is to overlook the fact that in its somewhat simplistic way it pays homage to an essential aspect of Japanese culture.  Its focus on the samurai reveals such centrally important Japanese values as face, honor, duty, politeness and the Bushido tradition that the samurai `shows no sign of joy or anger.' Algren is a visitor in a foreign world, one which he comes to admire deeply. We aren't told much about that culture, but we're shown people and an environment of great beauty.   The ironies of Kurosawa's samurai are missing, but the look of them is splendidly captured.  Thanks to Lilly Kilvert's designs, Ngila Dickson's costumes, and John Toll's cinematography (not to mention Zwick's orchestration of the great battles), this movie has fantastic production values.  Scene after scene, shot after shot, it never ceases to be a real aesthetic pleasure to look at. Sure, it's a bit adolescent to imagine a white man at the center of all this (it's a boy's fantasy), but the Japanese people aren't condescended to. And how else would you lure a western audience in to get a glimpse of this moment in Japanese history?  The whole presence of Algren, who is never referred to as `samurai' in the picture, is a cinematic convention to give focus to a depiction of the encounters between America and Japan at the time of the Satsuma rebellion when the emperor Meiji was young.  The focus of the story on the last few members of a warrior clan is a very literary one.  It's as elegiac as an Anglo-Saxon lament.  It's the celebration of a lost world that holds disappearing values to be superior to anything in the new world.  Is that wrong? Is it false? I confess to feeling a resurgence of my deepest Luddite sentiments while watching the howitzer artillery being cranked around and mowing down armored samurai on horseback, faring forth in their last charge, destroyed as if being fed into a meat grinder.  It's as good an indictment of modern technology as has been seen for many a reel.But the whole trouble with the film is not its still-wet-behind-the-ears white hero or its simplifications of Japanese culture and history, but its complete lack of irony.  Irony is something that any dying race quickly learns.  You get a hint of what might have been when Katsumoto (the admirable Ken Watanabe) keeps talking about trying to find the last line of his poem.  You would get more irony if anyone besides Katsumoto, with a third point of view, could come in and talk to Algren about the downside of the job:  about how the samurai were no longer anything but palace guards and hired killers, like mafia hit men (a reality that Kurosawa does show in his samurai movies, which Zwick professes to adore).  An example of a movie with splendid irony is Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 Le Samouraï, starring the cool, implacable Alain Delon.The Last Samurai however isn't a delicate piece of film noir like Le Samouraï; it's a Technicolor epic in the grand tradition.  Sure, Zwick is no John Ford or David Lean, but if you'll sit back and relax he'll give you a grand time.  And there's nary a terminator or replicant in sight.  My reaction when it was over was:  `That was a lot of nonsense - but I loved every minute of it!'My choice for Edward Zwick's best film:  the meandering but charming 1986 About Last Night, his version of David Mamet's play with Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, and James Belushi.",Null,0,1,6 December 2003
3 Idiots," Bollywood comedy blockbuster: pee jokes and wholesome life values
","Released around Christmas 2009 in over half a dozen countries '3 Idiots' , reportedly the highest grossing Bollywood movie of all time, earned $70 million worldwide within 18 days of entering theaters. It was also officially released early to YouTube, another first. In the US, where it's being being shown at AMC/Regal theaters, it made $5.5 million in its first 17 days, the highest US take for a Bollywood import.So what is this paragon? No 'Slumdog,' it's much more a standard commercial Indian film product. That means it's long, it's got tears, laughter, excitement, music and dance, and homilies about work and family. It's got romance, a beautiful girl who finds the hero in the end, and it's got running pee and fart and bum jokes. The screenplay of '3 Idiots' is drawn from Chetan Bhagat's 2004 bestseller Five Point Someone, a novel initially published in English and later reissued in Hindi. Bhagat's novel deals with the college exam angst and romance issues of three student buddies. But the film goes further afield, including childbirth during a blackout due to a monsoon flood, travels through gorgeous mountain landscapes of Ladakh seen from the air, trips back and forth over the period of a decade, one marvelous scene when a professor's mass of equations and symbols float off the blackboard up into the lecture hall, caressing the students. There are several full-dress Bollywood song-and-dance numbers, one in a hospital. The bright-colored cinematography is pleasant to look at. '3 Idiots' is virtually an epic of shared coming-of-age experiences with wholesome messages. These are: be true to yourself, live your dream. Be positive: the hero's mantra is 'Aal izz well.' Don't cheat -- unless you have to in a good cause. Don't rely on memorizing stuff; think for yourself. Avoid obsessing about the price and value of things. Remember where you came from. Remember your friends. The pressures of school in India where it may be the only way out of poverty are made clear, including the high incidence of suicide among students.And learn Hindi. There's a sequence when a nerdy materialist who lived abroad and didn't study it much is chosen to give a public address in a high-falutin literary form of the language, ending up with some lines in Sanscrit, which he's even more ignorant of. The buddies inject naughty substitute homonyms like the equivalent of 'screw' for 'serve' and he becomes a laughing stock.It's this materialistic memorizer bloke, Chatur Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya), who starts off the pre-title sequence by calling Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) to say he's located their engineering school pal 'Rancho' (Aamir Khan) who disappeared after graduation. Farhan has to take the annoying and materialistic Chatur along as he rounds up best buddy Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) to drive from New Delhi up to the mountain town of Shimla to find Rahcho, the pal who influenced and inspired them so much. Much of the film consists of flashbacks along the trip of all the many incidents that happened in engineering school, many involving the annoying and sadistic school principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), AKA 'Virus,' who has a beautiful daughter, Pia (Kareena Kapoor).The mercurial and diminutive Khan is so talented he gets away with playing Rancho as a student even though he's forty-something. Rancho is a compelling character: he's the inspiration, the catalyst a young person needs to move beyond his origins and live his dreams. Farhan is from a middle class family and has a huge talent for nature photography; his dad has pushed him toward engineering but he hates it. Raju comes from a dirt poor family -- images of his sick father, unmarried sister, and failing mom are in old-movie black and white -- and the way the family's future is resting on his engineering degree so terrifies him that he continually panics and fails the school tests. But he's a tremendously decent, soulful fellow whose rigorous honesty ultimately wins over potential employers. Rancho, whose origins are as obscure as his brilliance is evident, bows to no one and gets away with all kinds of infringements of the rules because or his inventive mind and fundamental decency.This summary barely scratches the surface. '3 Idiots' moves with precipitous speed through a dizzying array of incidents. A puzzling surprise comes just before the mid-way 'Interval.' And I said it was long. With that 'Interval,' the movie keeps you in the theater for three full hours. That's a lot of Hindi, and only a little English. But this feels like a cleansing, warm bath after Judd Apatow and Eddie Murphy. This is good entertainment, and it's neither mindless nor nasty. But is it art? Is it groundbreaking? No, one couldn't say that. It's just a breath of good humor and good sense from a more innocent place.",8,5,12,30 January 2010
Up," Let's stop congratulating Pixar
","'Up's' plot-line plays with the Pixar films' cross-generational appeal by having an oldster and a kid as its main characters. It's a buddy picture about the voyage of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), a 78-year-old widower, and Russell (Jordan Ngai), a chubby eight-year-old Asian 'Wilderness Explorer' who wants to earn an 'assisting the elderly' badge. The movie 'teaches' us that we can still realize our life-long deferred dream of exploring South American wilderness if we can just attach thousands of helium balloons to our house and sail away. It's hard to say if up to then Frederickson's life has been fulfillment or disappointment. His wife Ellie (Elie Docter) was a childhood playmate who dreamed of emulating an explorer named Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who has found a prehistoric bird in South America's Paradise Falls plateau. They never go very far. Ellie, alas, can't have children. One day when they're both in their senior years she falls down and shortly thereafter dies. Fredrickson has had a career as a balloon salesman.The film sketches in the couple's life as sweetness and smiles, yet hints at a world of disappointment symbolized by Ellie's 'adventure' scrapbook, which was never filled. Poor old Fredericksen won't move to a retirement home even though his little house is now surrounded by a vast loud construction zone. The demeaning practicalities of aging are depicted as something to escape from -- magically. When Fredericksen strikes an agent of the contractors and gets branded as a public menace he's somehow legally mandated to the old folks' home: this is the moment when he flies away, taking his house with him, with Russell a stowaway.There's no doubt about the exhilaration of an aerial escape, or the charm of the bond that develops between the old man and his dutiful, plucky little sidekick. But Up gets into deep trouble wit the arrival of the dogs, dozens of them, with electronic flashing collars that enable them to talk in squeaky (or sometimes deep) voices, in various languages according to what button you push. Forgive me, but I didn't buy it, and I just didn't see the need. Mr. Fredericksen is sold to us initially as a pretty feeble old man and so the strength and vigor he develops in South America is hard to accept. There's something to be said for a story that ends with the awarding of an explorer scout patch for assisting the elderly. All Russell really wanted to do was help the old man across the street, -- or even just across his lawn.I want to love Pixar films. Their animated features have moved from strength to strength. 'The Incredibles' was energetic and smart, 'Ratatouille' was witty and sophisticated, and 'WALL·E' wastranscendent and moving. Alas, Up does not live up to that standard.The house of Pixar has been declared triumphant in the field. Denby of The New Yorker heralds Pixar animations as examples of 'moral fable' and damns the old Disney ones as mere 'psychological fables' marked by 'cloyingness' and 'malevolent overtones.' Well, Up is full of cloyingness and weirdness, and the latter part of its adventure has its fair share of malevolence. Up is a hugely overblown fantasy whose point is lost in endless violations of the laws of biology and physics. Pixar has its ups and downs, features different writers and directors, and to typecast them is dubious. What they have in common is a technology and a look. The look is mainstream, as is the sensibility. If you want something more artistically or intellectually adventurous, you'll go to French animations like 'Persepolis' or 'Fantastic Planet' or F'ear(s) of the Dark;' 'The Triplets of Bellville' blows away the similarly dark American film 'Coraline.' Eastern European animations have a fresher look. The world of Japanese anime is rich, fantastic, and frequently very adult or sexual; it seems to capture the original, fantasmagoric world of comic books better than American comic-based films like the Batman franchise. Likewise graphic novel films like 'Frank Miller's Sin City' go far beyond the tame confines of Pixar or Disney. An adult animation like 'Waltz with Bashir' is in another league.It's a bad start for 'Up' and not a step in the direction of technical or artistic innovation if you're forced, as you may be, to watch 'Up' in 3-D. The glasses, on top of your own, weigh upon and pinch your nose and the dimmed images with the planar levels they create are as flat and fake-looking as your grandmother's stereopticon slides. This Fifties movie gimmick with its chintzy throwaway plastic specs is unconvincingly heralded as the great new technology. It didn't do much for the creepy 'Coraline,' the fascistic 'U2/3D,' still less for the slipshod 'Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience,' and it only detracted from Zemeckis' watchable 'Beowulf.' 3-D is supposed to look incredibly real, but even granting this dubious claim, why use it for 'Up,' which flaunts its unreality? Its digital figures are like painted toys. Its Paradise Falls looks unabashedly like paper-mâché rocks and fake foam. The Pixar images pop out at you without the effect of 3-D imaging, the colors are brighter, and the experience is more absorbing. Why not let us use our own imaginations? There's some thrill of adventure in this movie, and certainly the titillation of swooping flights and dives through space, as well as the time-honored animation scare of teetering on a precipice, and going into free fall only to be magically saved. But this, compared to the best Pixar films, gets lost in its gimmicks at the cost of a meaningful tale. Of course a travel yarn is just one thing after another anyway, and there's' no harm in an adventure with the moral of a good deed attacked to it. But that's just what it is, though: attached. And how much richer were the worlds of 'WALL·E,' 'Ratatouille,' and 'The Incredibles'! 'Up' has less to offer to adults than they did.",7,3,6,3 June 2009
Departures," The power of ritual in life and death
","Masahiro Motoki is a good comic mime, a useful talent for depicting a Japanese in distress. He plays Daigo Kobayashi, a young cello player who faces the end of his chosen career when the Tokyo symphony orchestra he is part of is dissolved by its owner. He doesn't think he has the talent to get into another orchestra so he sells his expensive cello (which he's still paying for) and moves back to his town in the country. His wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) assents to this with brave smiles. There's a house there for them that his mother left him.And then comes the job. Daigo answers an ad that's promising. 'Departures,' it says. He assumes something in travel. Easy hours, good pay. The boss hires him immediately and gives him a wad of bills. Only trouble: the work is 'encoffination,' or putting dead people into caskets for cremation. ('Departures' was a misprint for 'Departed.') This is where Motoki gets to make funny faces as he struggles with surprise, discomfort, and out and out nausea. The first corpse his boss Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) takes him along to work on is an elderly lady who was dead two weeks before she was found, and it's summertime. After this ordeal he can't face dinner without retching. He hides from his wife what he is doing. But the pay is good and the boss is a decent man and he needs work so he stays on.In professional lingo Moviefone calls this movie 'a feel-good dramady about death.' Younger people, already sick of the Academy's easy Oscar choices, mocked its members for giving the Best Foreign prize this year to 'Departures' over the edgy Israeli animation about war trauma, 'Waltz with Bashir.' Yes, 'Departures' is softer; but it has depths and its subject is universal. I'd listen to the octogenarian wisdom of the veteran New York critic Andrew Sarris, who calls this 'the most moving film I have ever seen commemorating the bonds between the living and the dead.' It's also a lesson in the beauty of Japanese tradition that expresses those bonds. Not so long ago, as Sasaki explains to Daigo, Japanese families prepared their own departed. Now the funeral agents and the casket preparers (Sasaki is the latter) have moved in. But the process still retains traditional honesty and grace. In a process both elegantly respectful and forthright, the body is prepared in front of the assembled family mourners by the funeral professionals. (Sasaki turns out to be a very good one.) In a series of graceful gestures. the body is wiped and cleaned, undressed, turned, and re-clothed, the face caressed, the hands smoothed and placed together just so, all with the deftness of motion that is the Japanese genius, and always discretely shielding the flesh of the deceased from the view of the watchers. Then, well wrapped, the body is gently laid in the casket. The mourners may come forward and say their goodbyes before the box is closed. Shortly thereafter it is taken to a crematorium. Daigo quickly masters the respectful drama of this process, particularly the way the face and hands are manipulated and the clothing is moved, and comes to appreciate the profound emotional meaning it has for the mourners. It's both a leave-taking of the person and an acknowledgment that the deceased is really already gone. Of course immensely complex feelings are involved. Daigo settles into the work. Nonetheless he continues to hide from Mika what he's doing.When she finds out, she goes home to her mother, promising to return only when Daigo quits the job. But the way he enjoys playing his small but tuneful childhood cello again now shows he accepts his new circumstances and is not unhappy. Daigo's roots in the town are symbolized by the old bath house where he goes to cleanse himself after the dressing of the decomposing old lady on his first days's work. It is run by another old lady, Tsuyako (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), the mother of his former best friend. When she suddenly drops dead and Mika returns for the encoffination ceremony, she realizes the beauty and importance of the ritual Daigo performs for Tsuyako's family. Daigo's father ran a café in their house and went off with a young waitress when he was a boy, abandoning him and his mother. He hates his father and doesn't want to know anything about him. But when by chance -- or more accurately screenwriter Kundo Koyama's obvious arrangement -- he learns about his father's death, Mika pushes him to go and do the ceremony himself, with her at his side, and this time the ritual is a profound personal healing process for Daigo himself, whose tears pour down as he performs it. When a few months pass and winter comes Mika comes back to live with Diago after she discovers she's pregnant, even though she still wants him to quit the job. The film underlines how humble and traditional roles are essential to a society, even as it looks down on them, by showing the dignity of the encoffination process; of the man who handles the cremations; of old Tsuyako running the comfortable old bath house that her son wanted to close and turn into more profitable real estate.This film is a tribute to the magic and comfort of human ritual. Hence the encoffination process is shown repeatedly, even behind the end credits. It's what the film is about: everything else is footnotes to this ceremony. Sometimes the mourners make it tumultuous, embarrassing, or comic. But it retains the beauty of a culture that knows the value of theater. Takita's movie is more than the sum of its sometimes sentimental or obvious parts. In the beauty of its most humdrum moments, with its focus on everyday family necessities (it celebrates food too), 'Departures' is not at all remote from the quintessentially Japanese quotidian grandeur celebrated in the film masterpieces of Yasajiro Ozu.",9,23,25,6 July 2009
Inside Man," Shaggy dog bank heist: a smooth entertainment that ultimately fizzles
","Spike Lee's personal inside job, a conventional bank heist film that has a shaggy dog twist on the genre and a spattering of feisty Spike-isms about Sikh's profiled as 'rag-heads' and robbed of their turbans by cops, a racist video game played by an 8 ¾-year-old black boy from Brooklyn bothering the white head robber, an Albanian ex- called in by a bystander to identify a distraction tape, a puzzle about Grand Central andwell, they're the best of the film so it's best not to give them all away. And the film sparkles sometimes because its creaky machinery, echoing such outdated classics as the explicitly referenced Dog Day Afternoon, is kept going by pros like Denzel Washington, as the head cop, Christopher Plummer as the bank president with an anachronistic secret to hide, Jodie Foster as the suave fixer he hires to hide if for him, and Clive Owen as the preternaturally calm bank robbery mastermind.It's also intriguing that a small group of robbers take over an austere downtown Manhattan bank, terrorize several dozen bystanders who become hostages, and dress them all up to look alike -- and like them. Likewise it tweaks our genre-tired curiosity to see as things drag on and the pizza gets stale that the robber doesn't want the dough, doesn't want the 747; doesn't want to kill hostages (or does he?): what the heck does he want? But at some point even though the pacing is good, we gradually stop caring. And then it's not just the pizza but the suspense that has gone stale.I guess the young first-time screen writer Russell Gewirtz's story appealed to Spike because it hinges on a rich white guy whose wealth all got started with a mega-wrong: cooperating with the Nazis. One trouble: the actor's too young to have done that. Another trouble: he wouldn't have saved the incriminating document. A third: evidence of his wrongdoing would be in a dozen places other than that document. How Clive would know about this, and how Clive would get away with his final escape trick, are not to be asked; this clever story that seems to have entertaining new twists on convention, takes a long time to get to an anticlimactic and bumpy finale. What are Jodie and Denzel doing sitting on that bench at the end, chatting? Not a darn thing, except taking a bow.Even though Lee can't edit himself down to under two hours and this movie splits its seams a bit, he is a pro and he can entertain and provide original socio-political commentary -- this time the more effective for being plot-driven and not crudely in-our-face. But the trouble is the excitement generated by the setup and the interplay between members of the cop hierarchy (including Willem Dafoe and Chiwetel Ejiofor), and the usual phone calls and negotiational gambits and challenges, goes into that slow fizzle-out once it's clear the robber is just stalling. Stalling is stalling. There's only one act of violence that might get your heart rate up again, and if you've been paying attention, it won't.So in the end, if you like Spike Lee's efforts to be mainstream, and you don't care if they quite work, this is an entertaining film. But if you expect real punch or quirkiness from Spike, don't come knocking, not this time.",8,3,4,25 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Code blue
","'The Da Vinci Code' was a big bestseller, not, generally, a sign of great literary merit. The author Dan Brown's method, as well as one can detect from the Ron Howard movie version, is to bombard you with arcane-sounding information about Christianity, the divinity of Jesus, signs and symbols, the Priory, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, and of course Leonardo Da Vinci, who's woven in as an officer of the Priory and unifies the story, to a degree, because it begins with a murder in the Louvre (wasn't Da Vinci an artist? and doesn't he have a painting or two in the Louvre?) -- and to add absurd and quite unbelievable twists, in the interest of -- what, exactly? Well, keeping the story going, I guess. Some who read the book say it looks very foolish on screen. Yes, it does. One doesn't need to read the book to see that. One wonders if this movie will bury the book or revive it. Certainly with the libel trial in London and the pore-opening publicity about 'anti-Christian' content, the book has so far done well for the movie's box office.What's 'The Da Vinci Code' a story about, exactly? It could be regarded as simply a murder mystery, but it's both much more ambitious and much less successful than the usual detective story. Brown's revisionist account of the Council of Nicaea and claim, at least for the purposes of the novel, that Christ's divinity was a matter of general dispute at the time of the Emperor Constantine, and that Jesus started a blood line with Mary Magdalene, that this was covered up, that the Holy Grail is really a feminine symbol -- the blasphemy gets lost in absurdity and the tangled web adds up to very little, but it keeps Ron Howard and hapless viewers busy and befuddled for two and a half hours. All of this is too preposterous and silly to deserve to be considered a threat to anyone's faith, but the fact that Christians have objected to Brown's book and to its being made into a movie has been amply capitalized upon by the Hollywood promoters (See Frank Rich on the op ed page of Sunday's NYTimes -- May 21, 2006).What happens? A guy gets murdered, pursued by a faceless monk, and flays himself on the floor of the museum. A Harvard professor and expert on symbols named Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) who's conveniently in Paris to give a big lecture (conveniently in English) is summoned by a certain French detective (soon replaced by the main detective, Bezu Fache, i.e., the trusty Jean Reno -- looking bloated, and wasted here) to help out with the symbolism of the cuts the murdered gentleman has made in his body -- and the story is on its jagged way. Clever Prof. Langdon may be, but he needs help, and it comes in the form of a French police cryptographer, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou).Langdon and Neveu proceed to lecture each other through the rest of the movie, augmented by an old friend of Langdon's, Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McClellan, who shouldn't be here; but who should?), a sort of expert on the Holy Grail who's supposedly in search of that mythical object. What sinks the movie for any intelligent viewer is that it treats us as idiots. It explains the obvious and claims the most ludicrous absurdities to be true.Brown's story demonizes the 'prelature' known as Opus Dei, to a degree toned down, it's said, in the movie -- but Opus Dei in the movie still includes homicidal self-flagellating monks, most notably the albino madman Silas (Paul Bettany), whose use of the cilice, a way of digging nails in one's leg, is gruesomely illustrated in a scene that would appeal to any masochist and shows off Bettany's hunky nakedness. Silas comes in every so often to start up our pulses, which tend to die down with all the tedious explanations that make up the bulk of the movie.Langdon is a professor of 'symbology,' which Walter Chaw accurately describes as 'a malapropism invented by idiots so as not to confuse their flock with real words like 'semiotics' or 'epistemology.'' He's a debased -- horribly debased -- version of Joseph Campbell -- as if Campbell's unifying humanism were reducible to riddles and word games. The movie does a bit better with its monsters -- Silas, and a couple of initially kindly-seeming figures. But the screen-time belongs to the boring explainers, and Hanks and Tautou make the least sexy couple imaginable.Reno's casting as a daring detective in a mystery involving murderous monks makes a kind of mindless casting sense, since he played the same thing -- in the person of the intrepid Commissioner Niemans in Matthieu Kassovitz's rousing horror-actioner 'Crimson Rivers.' The sequel, ably directed for visuals by Olivier Dahan but less well for character, also stars Reno as Niemans and is full of FACELESS, HOMICIDAL MONKS. Either of the 'Crimson Rivers' films provides five times the satisfaction of the talky, absurd 'Da Vinci Code.'",6,1,4,24 May 2006
The Fountain," Life, death, love, I'm okay with those things
","'Spanning over one thousand years, and three parallel stories, The Fountain is a story of love, death, spirituality, and the fragility of our existence in this world.' I confess myself not a fan of Aronofsky, and this ambitious excursion into sci-fi metaphysics does nothing to banish my previous annoyance at his muddy avant-gardism (Pi) and his simpleminded tract on drugs that unaccountably was greeted as hip (Requiem for a Dream). After a longish pause, he has taken another direction, one of greater ambition but no greater clarity or good sense. He now has a beautiful girlfriend, mother of his child, Academy Award winner Rachel Weisz, whom he's made the center of a movie aboutwhat? You be the judge, but obviously it touches on modest topics like love, death, spirituality, and the fragility of our existence in this world, seeking to encompass them through a three-pronged story-line about: 1. A present-day medical researcher, Tommy Oreo (Hugh Jackman), working on monkeys with brain tumors in hopes of finding a cure for his wife Izzi's (Wiesz's) tumor; she has one too. This leads to some medically and scientifically questionable procedures (unlikely ones too) which a distinguished supervisor, Dr. Lillian Guzetti (Ellen Burstyn) strenuously disapproves of. 2. A Spanish explorer, Tomas (Jackman, looking for the fountain of life (or youth) in Latin America, urged on by Queen Isabel (Weisz), with trouble afoot from Grand Inquisitor Silecio (Stephen McHattie). Encounters with Mayan hierophants dressed up like in Apocalypto also occur. Thre's some hand-to-hand combat, but nobody's heart gets ripped out. 3. Meanwhile in the future sometime a sort of astronaut or guru is floating in outer space, sometimes in the yoga position. His name is Tommy (Jackman) and his guiding spirit is ..you guessed it, Izzi (Weisz). He seems to be the custodian of a magical tree. Variations in chevelure distinguish the two stars in the separate time-frames. In sequence 1, Jackman has the unshaven look, with a down-flop hairdo. In No. 2, he's lushly bearded. In 3, he's as bald as an egg. Weisz's hair lengths vary appropriately. Now, themes do emerge, and they're grand. 'Death is an act of creation,' the Maya priest (who's into killing people) says. 'What if you could live forever?''Death is a disease, like any other,' medical researcher Tommy shouts. 'Death frees every soul,' somebody says. Tomas samples the sap from a magical tree. Dropped on the ground it makes a stripling spring up instantly covered with leaves. Tomas applies it to a wound and the wound closes. He drinks a big glob of it and that is a big mistake. He's covered with striplings, springing out of his body. Back to the drawing board on that one. The plight of researcher Tommy and his brave but doomed wife Izzi gets most of the screen time, and this is the segment that is easiest to parse into a narrative (though it's corny and punctuated with vapid dialogue), while not only is the development of the other segments spotty, their relationship to each other and the main plot remains incoherent, at most symbolic. Jackman is a good sport; it's not his fault that his futuristic guru and his conquistador are mere fragments and his recurrent stints as the nervous researcher are stagy and less convincing than a TV hospital series. Weisz is a radiant beauty and a warm presence; she has a few moments when her emotions seem real. Her Spanish queen is just a static cameo. Ellen Burstyn adds class to a minor role. It's hard to speak of direction. The uncertainty of this project is indicated by the fact that it is an attempt to redo a glossier one for which Warner Brothers put up $75 million (of which $20 million was spent), and which was to star Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Irreconcilable difference between Pitt and Aronofsky were cited. Brad and Cate apparently went off to do the equally over-ambitious but infinitely superior Babel This pickup version was made for less than half the original budget. It appears corners were cut on the lighting. It is dim. The movie itself is a murky mess. This is one genius whose mind I don't want to be trapped inside of.",6,1,3,15 December 2006
Mystic River," Detective story epic
","Mystic River the film, like the Dennis Lehane novel Brian Helgeland adapted for it, seeks to raise the police procedural/murder mystery genre to the level of dark, solemn, tragic epic, much as do the Godfather series and James Gray's The Yards. The story aims successfully to convey the essential feel of life in working class Boston  especially the lifelong interconnectedness of its inhabitants. A doomed common past congeals into the film's prologue with three eleven-year-old boys playing hockey in the street in front of their houses. Jimmy and Dean watch while Dave is lured away in a car by two evil men posing as cops. We understand with horror that he is sexually abused and tortured for four days before he manages to run away. `Sometimes it seems as if we all three got in that car,' the adult Jimmy says. `Escaped from wolves' is how Dave sees himself. Dave's terrible childhood experience highlights the brutal, inhuman side of mankind. The horror of it hovers over the events that follow. Twenty-five years later Jimmy's 19-year old daughter is found murdered in a deep hole in a wood much like the cellar where Dave was held by the molesters. The murder reactivates the painful ties between these three individuals, their families, and their emotional histories.
The movie unfolds in the slow, solemn, methodical, sometimes flat Clint Eastwood directorial style that for the most part works compellingly here because of the story's inherently tragic overtones and because the excellent cast acts with powerful understatement. A forgivable exception is Sean Penn in the lead role as Jimmy Markum, the murdered girl's dad, a reformed criminal who owns a convenience store. He is a violent man who races to find the murderer before the homicide detectives, one of whom is the other boy who watched Dave taken away, Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon). Penn's performance is explosive, the others' implosive. The Jimmy/Sean dualism is obvious. The wild card is Dave (hauntingly played by Tim Robbins), a recessive, suffering handyman whose wife suspects him because he has come home very late on the night of the murder saying he's killed a mugger. Not only is the painful intimacy between the three men reactivated by the murder, but Dave's and Jimmy's wives are cousins. It's as if the people are all cousins. They cannot escape from each other. This is a closed world of haunted memories and moldering disappointments. Katie, the dead girl, had a boyfriend, Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry) who was about to run away with her. Brendan has a mean, foulmouthed mother and a mute younger brother and the boys and the brother's best pal were often seen at Jimmy's convenience store, just as Dave was at the bar where Katie was seen the night she died. A nightmare has begun and we watch with fascination as it unfolds. As the detective Dean, with his partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne), explore the case, the many characters are serially highlighted. A punishing and manipulative final sequence cuts back and forth between a vigilante killing and the detectives' tracking down of the real killer. There are some oddities. At forty-three (Penn) and forty-five (Bacon and Robbins), the lead actors are clearly too old for the thirty-five-year old characters they're playing. (That they're meant to be that young means Jimmy was 16 when his daughter Katie was born.) Halfway through Whitey and Dean are revealed to be working for the FBI; why wasn't this clear earlier? Bacon's relatively uninteresting performance can't entirely be faulted, since his role is purely functional, but it's still a disappointment. The shots of his missing wife showing only part of her face at a pay phone seem pointless teases. Marcia Gay Harden's skittishness is mannered and irritating. And there are times when the relentless rhythm of the movie begins to falter and merely seem slow. Dave is sucked down by a crime of which he was the victim and it seems he too must be punished after he has sought indirect revenge for the perverted act that has maimed him for life. Yet his own incestuous murder goes unpunished. The fatalism of the story must have appealed to Eastwood's sensibility, but also its rootedness in the mundane world of working class Boston. The interconnectedness and slow inevitablability of Mystic River's sad story may link it with the Greeks, but it's only the everyday naturalism the film achieves that validates the film as tragedy, that gives the violent events true weight and humanity. The film's solemnity works because of the way Robbins and Bacon (Penn less so) immaculately mimic Boston accents and the cameramen capture the familiar look of Boston Streets and interiors. Without that anchoring in the ordinary, the high air of epic horror would seem garish and cheap. Clint Eastwood ages well. At seventy-three he has directed perhaps his most complex film. And he has even composed the sad, brooding, but never heavy-handed score, which with a poetic justice rare in Hollywood is performed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.",Null,0,0,15 October 2003
The Departed," Stunning remake: but why a remake, from Scorsese?
","Writer William Monahan uses a borrowed premise, borrowed plot, for Martin Scorsese's exciting and violent new crime movie, The Departed. The Irish Catholic intonation of the title emphasizes the Boston setting. We're far from the HongKong of the original, Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak's Infernal Affairs . A group of Chinese triad gangsters are mocked with racial epithets, as if to further distance the new version from the Asian original. But the HongKong source remains. It's an illustrious one: the original was a well-made, well-acted film and so hugely successful two sequels appeared before this remake could be finished.Internal Affairs' mirror-image plot structure is so clever and one might almost say so obvious that it's surprising it was never used before. It gets deeper than ever into the always potentially incestuous, sometimes interchangeable, relationship between cops and robbers. In this story, the two main characters do cross over. And their goal is to stay there. In the original there is perhaps more of a sense conveyed of how hard it is to sustain the deception over time. Everything is so fast and furious in The Departed we don't think of the time.The cunning premise is that once upon a time there were two young men, who both eventually became police cadets. One almost from the start (we see him as a mere kid, at a soda fountain) becomes the protégé of a gangland boss who, when the boy becomes a man, persuades him to infiltrate the police force and spy on its activities for the gang. Matt Damon is at his most unappealing and blank as this slick liar. The other is a smart kid from a seedy family with Irish mafia links but an honest if unsuccessful dad, now departed, who doesn't do so well as a police cadet but is eagerly recruited by the police undercover division as an ideal person to infiltrate the gang. Leonardo DiCaprio is overwrought but strong as the pill-popping pseudo crook, who of course is in more danger. He must live among sadists, bad guys. The cops have foul mouths: this is writer Monahan's delight. But they are not made to appear as psychopaths.The two men are like stage managers, observing and calling shots from inside to a force outside. But unlike the God (and the artist) of Joyce's Portrait of the Artist who looks down from above, 'within or behind or beyond or above his work, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails,' these two mirror-image undercover operatives are always hiding and in danger of being found out, vulnerable to the consequences of any action. In the original, you're struck by how alike they are. They run the same dangers and play the same game of betrayal of associates. Here in the American version somehow the contrast is made stronger. The film is nihilistic and cruel, but it is moral in this aspect. Damon is a despicable fat cat, given a posh apartment. DiCaprio is a nervous outsider, sensitive and suffering. But even Damon and DiCaprio have a certain square-jawed similarity.The Chinese original had the two major matinée idols of HongKong film, Jeff Lau in Damon's role and Tony Leung in DiCaprio's, so you can't say it too didn't have big names. It ran fifty minutes shorter though and the performances were more understated: there was a greater economy and subtlety. Using Damon, Mark Wahlberg, and Charlie Sheen adds to the authentic sound of the Boston accents. The overlay is convincing. Another new touch is having a woman both moles are interested in; Vera Farmiga is a psychotherapist whom Damon dates and DiCaprio is treated by. There's also Ray Winstone, excellent, as always, as crime boss Costello's associate.And there's Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello himself. Since the running time and the baroque expansion of scenes gives the actors too much time to ham it up, Jack just winds up being Jack. Apart from that, he doesn't feel like a crime boss. He doesn't have the physical authority of James Gandolfini, the stillness of real menace (which Winstone has). He feels like an over-the-top actor who's descended into mannerisms and comedy.In the original film, the parallelism is cunning: it's all you really need; the situation itself is extremely suspenseful. You don't have to jazz it up.The new version is also more moralistic. DiCaprio is more of a martyr and Damon more of a scumbag. The Chinese version makes you feel more sympathy for each, more conscious of the danger they're both in and the parallelism of their roles.Monahan is praised for his dialogue, and it's certainly spicy, but it's overdone. All Wahlberg does as the undercover cops' handler is insult and swear at people. He's generally the most appealing character in a crime movie, but this time he's a little wasted. Nicholson's character is incapable of referring to a priest without mentioning pederasty or a wife without alluding to fellatio.All this aside, the two and a half hours go by quickly enough. Scorsese's editor Thelma Schoonmaker does a bang-up job; the actors are in fine (if in Nicholson's case overripe) form. This is Scorsese's first crime movie since Casino and his most entertaining in a long time. It's also arguably his most nihilistic. After everybody blows everybody else's head off and the bad guy gets a commendation (but not the girl), there's nothing left on the ground but blood and cynicism. Great entertainment, a damned good show. But still the question remains: why does a filmmaker of the caliber of Martin Scorsese want to do a remake, even of a story as archetypal as Lau and Mak's Infernal Affairs?",8,0,0,8 October 2006
Crazy Heart," Stumbling toward salvation, one day at a time
","'Crazy Heart' is a simple but emotionally resonant movie about a 57-year-old alcoholic country singer whose career is on the skids. There's not much to the story, but not much is necessary with Jeff Bridges as the singer, Bad Blake; Colin Farrell as Tommy Sweet, his handsome acolyte, now a big country music star; Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jean Craddock, a small-time New Mexico journalist with a four-year-old boy who has lousy luck with men, and falls for Bad; and Robert Duvall as Wayne, the singer's clean-and-sober bartender-protector.Bridges, Gyllenhaal and Farrell have never been better, and Duvall is always pure gold. This movie is Bridges' chance to give a master class in acting, and he does not disappoint for a minute, but he's not alone in the spotlight, and the depth of support he gets is what makes Crazy Heart worth watching.A lifelong musician and many-talented artist (painting, photography, ceramics) whose thespian preeminence in Hollywood has yet to win him an Oscar, Jeff Bridges inhabits the songs he sings on screen as convincingly and seamlessly as he fits into the shambles of a life and mess of a body that is the film's protagonist. This musical integrity is important because Bad Blake is one of those disintegrating performers whose art has not faltered, though his life has. The songs he sings are his own, and when he's on stage, he's alive. The rest of the time he's lying, deceiving, or numbing out. A great line is when he's asked by Jean where his songs come from and he replies simply, 'Life, unfortunately.' A parallel to Bridges' work in 'Crazy Heart' is the similarly lived-in and authentic performance as a waning dance hall singer by Gérard Depardieu in Xavier Giannoli's 'The Singer'/'Quand j'étais chanteur,' a richly atmospheric little film released but barely seen in the US. But the milieu here is very different, and as American as 'The Singer's' is French. First time director Scott Cooper has said this movie tells 'Merle Haggard's' story and Kris Kristofferson's and Waylon Jennings'. As Bad Blake, Jeff moves like Waylon, he has Merle Haggard's songwriting ability and Kris Kristofferson's charisma.' Of course Bridges looks a lot like Kristofferson, and Bad Blake puts his hard times into his felt, authentic compositions as Waylon and Merle did. The songs are composed by T Bone Burnett, and are fine; more authenticity is added through other songs such as Townes Van Zandt's 'If I Needed You' and Waylon Jennings' 'Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way.' Burnett composed the songs with the late Stephen Bruton; and the closing ballad, 'The Losing Kind,' with Ryan Bingham. Farrell as well as Bridges does his own singing, and his Irishness merges fairly convincingly into a slick country style. Just as Bad Blake is the mentor of Tommy Sweet, in real life Robert Duvall has become a mentor of the actor-writer-director, so his presence anchors the film and presides over it. Bridges knew of the movie but held off from committing to it till he learned his friend Burnett was in, so this is project that must have felt right, ultimately, for all concerned.Bridges' Bad Blake is so authentically blousy and pathetic he's hard to look at sometimes. He's always drunk and at an opening gig at a Pueblo, Coloradi bowling rink, throws up in a back alley between songs, while the young pickup band he's saddled with has to fill in. In Santa Fe Jean shows up to do an interview, and a May-December romance develops as Bad woos Jean against her better judgment and plies her little boy with homemade pancakes (the boy is hungry for a man in his life and Bad oozes charm, when he's conscious). Gyllenhaal, who played a character struggling with addiction and recovery herself in 'SherryBaby,' gives a performance as a women warring inside with loneliness and need. Her scenes with Bridges are central to the movie, and the chemistry is strong between them.Blake hasn't written songs for some years, but when he meets up with Tommy prior to a date opening for him to an audience of 12,00 in Denver, Tommy begs him to write some for him. In this way the screenplay manages to steer a course, perhaps a bit too easily, between success and failure. Clearly Bad Blake is still working, even if it's at lousy venues, and to prove it he's always on the phone to a hard-nosed Manager (James Keane) who's finding him the best gigs he can. This eventually leads to a contract to compose songs for an album with Tommy.'Crazy Heart,' which was written by Cooper from the eponymous novel by Thomas Cobb, is perhaps a bit schematic about the up-down-up trajectory of the talented loser, but it manages to be pretty realistic about the degeneration that is terminal alcoholism. Here, however, it's not a slide into hell like Mike Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas. Though only by the skin of his teeth, and with multiple ailments a car crash reveals, Bad is surviving. So when the moment comes and he hits his bottom, he still has the strength to straighten out. Maybe the fast-forward finale is a bit too upbeat, but the memory the movie leaves is, of course, of Bridges with a bottle, a guitar, and a sad sweet song, and of some of the year's best movie acting.",9,80,102,6 January 2010
War of the Worlds," Sound and fury
","'War of the Worlds' is largely a reversion to a Fifties Sci-Fi scare movie, with far more splendid and real-looking effects but less of a world-view or point than those earlier things had. These silly pod creatures, with their various pod-offspring or excrescences, that all wither away like the aliens at the end of Shyamalan's 'Signs' -- allergic to terrestrial microorganisms instead of H2O -- if they're such superior beings, how come they have to go out and mow down humans one by one? To scare us in an old-fashioned way, must be the answer. But there is no time allowed to speculate as to their purpose (other than extermination) since all Tom Cruise and his two children do is flee -- to mama. But to get back to the creatures on vast spindly stilts: if they're so menacing and powerful, why can't they find three people in a basement (where Tim Robbins helps provide the movie's most tedious minutes)? The screenplay of War of the Worlds is contemptible; but the effects, especially in the big crowd scenes and when some New Jersey streets are crumbling, are terrific. Some of the simple desperation of cheaper, but more human end-of-the-world movies like Michael Haneke's recent 'Hour of the Wolf' is evoked as Cruise's son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) are almost whisked away in a darkened field and a crowd struggles to get onto a ferryboat. The end is as lame as that of Roland Emmerich's 'The Day After Tomorrow,' whose trajectory it much resembles: going home to mama resolves the problem of a wrecked planet.Spielberg has always used children, sometimes in heartrending, sometimes in purely manipulative ways. This time he begins with a divorced couple with shared custody and a contrast of class and attitude. Ray Ferrier (Cruise) is a surly construction worker, macho and uncooperative on the job, unable to bother with his little girl and young teenage son who're deposited with him on weekends by his ex-wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto), who's off to her parents' in Boston. The world erupts when freak electric storms herald an invasion of monsters out of the earth which destroy much -- but not all! -- around the holes they emerge from with horrific blasts of sound. So Ray and the two kids don't have to decide how to spend the weekend. They go on an expedition -- in (wonder of wonders) the only car for miles around that runs after the storms (it was the solenoids--smart Ray to think of it!) -- first to the big McMansion Mary Ann occupies with her new husband in a posh suburb, then when that turns into a war zone over night, on to grandpa and grandma's place in Boston. Heroically inclined Robbie runs off in a field -- presumably to join the army at fourteen -- but is at the grandparents when Ray gets there: wonder of wonders! Little Rachel (perhaps the braver of the two) stays to weather Tim Robbins' dialogue in that dank basement.Tom Cruise hasn't had a good role other than 'Collateral's' nihilist hit man -- which was a very good one, in a beautifully crafted movie -- in years. In 'War of the Worlds,' he's been accused of sentimentalizing his character, playing for our sympathy when he began as a prick. This is a misreading of the screenplay, which has this quite natural progress toward caring for his kids built into it; this isn't Cruise's betrayal of his role. He's okay, but he has nothing to deal with. He hardly deserves credit for not hamming it up. It's not a sure thing that he knows how to ham it up. Dakota Fanning is excellent. She takes us through a lot of emotions the action calls for that the movie would lack without her. The kitsch pseudo-ecological thinking behind 'The Day After Tomorrow' looks like Newton and Einstein next to Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds.'Still, Spielberg provides entertainment and some thrills with his awesome effects, not so much the monsters and their reaching tentacles and insect bodies and faces, which we have seen before, as with the cracking up of streets and falling down of buildings, and some splendid devastation, notably the wreckage of houses and cars and airplanes outside Miranda Otto's McMansion, and for the manipulation of crowds, especially around the ferry landing.",7,1,2,24 August 2005
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Jimmy Stewart meets Anne Hathaway, and like awesome magic stuff sorta happens
","This is a movie analogous in general genre terms to Scorsese's 'After Hours:' it's an all-night ramble in New York City with lost and found people and other complications and a sine-wave of emotions. Its talk and its hero's choice CD-mixes mark it as a picture of and for if not by the iPod generation, white bridge-and-tunnel version. Nobody gets seriously hurt, not anybody we care about anyway, though there's some serious grossness in sequences involving a drunk girl, who's a good friend of the protagonist's soon-to-be new girlfriend. He is in the process of breaking up with his previous girlfriend, who shows her unsuitability by doing a sexy dance in front of the hero's Yugo car while he's at the wheel watching. It's not what he wants anymore. He's discovered you can have a good conversation with a girl. His response is to back up and drive away, leaving her alone and unattended in a remote-looking part of one of the outer boroughs. Why is that okay? Because Rudy Giuliani made the town safe.At the center of it all is the playlist, or the man who makes mixes which the new girl happens to love even more than the old girlfriend. What bands you like among the American high school set defines you. Nick O'Leary (Michael Cera) is the guy, and his nocturnal wanderings in search of love have a focus: he's the one straight guy in a Queercore (i.e. gay boy) band whose current name is The Jerk-Offs (can that really be original?). They're thinking of other names and their Asian member Thom (veteran token Oriantal Aaron Yoo: watch for him--he's good) favors Sh-t Sandwich. This is the kind of thing that keeps you watching when otherwise not much is happening other than cars being recklessly driven around New York City and gay boys looking cute. The gay boys are in a van; Nick chooses to drive his own valiant but battered yellow-orange Yugo. That the new girlfriend (spoiler alert) wrecks it, even though she can drive stick shift, sort of, and Nick goes right ahead into the diner to talk to her right afterwards anyway, shows that she has like totally already won his affections.Norah is the new girl. And why does she deserve it? Actually she arrives by chance, when Nick asks her to to pose as his girlfriend just for five minutes so he can avoid recapture by his ex, Tris (Alexis Dziena). What a five minutes. Kids change fast.Norah is Kat Dennings, who has survived 'Sarah Bartlett' and 'House Bunny' to arrive at this more distinctive venue. She's a beautiful girl with big lips, who looks more like Anne Hathaway than Anne Hathaway does in her downbeat indie mode for Jonathan Demme's 'Rachel Getting Married.' Norah has understated caché. She gets everyone into any of the clubs, because, it turns out, her father heads one of the most successful recording studios in New York. But she's modest about that, and doesn't brag, though she shows off the studio to Nick later on in this long night. Like wow. And wow. And can I hold that guitar? And can I hold you?The whole band outing has another purpose--the only thing that gets Nick out of his house to join them. Rumor has it that a cult indie band he and the (other) Jerk-Offs and also Norah all adore, called Where's Fluffy? is playing at some as yet not quite determined exclusive venue. Several bait-and-switch club runs occur before, in the wee small hours, Where's Fluffy is found--but--another guarantee of true (newly discovered) love--Nick and Norah forget about Where's Fluffy? and leave the club to be with each other and go back to New Jersey from whence they both come--Englewood and Hackensack.Another plot device is the drunk girl, who Norah cares about. She's called Caroline (Ari Graynor), and she's the one who (spoiler alert) does some nasty things with vomit and a toilet and a cell phone and a wad of gum that I would rather not have seen, though such stuff is a lot more harmless than serial killers or Abu Ghraib. Caroline has to be carted away, and the gay band boys volunteer to take her on so that Norah and Nick can be alone together. But then (spoiler alert) they lose her, somehow, and everybody goes looking for her again.None of this matters. It's the thinnest pretense for a plot to keep things moving along and turn a lot of noise and stickiness and bad band names into a dream first date. Rachel Cohn and David Levithan wrote the gay-friendly and Jewish-friendly but persons-of-color-free young adult novel on which this charming little film is based. Lorene Scafaria did the screenplay, in collaboration with Ms. Cohn.The main reason for watching is to see Michael Cera, the young actor from a suburb of Toronto, in a more sustained role than he's had before. His appearances on TV have been many and date from when he was 10; he's now 20. This is not exactly a case of Arrested Development, but many know him from that series. On the big screen he was arresting in both Superbad and Juno. The Apatow 'Freaks and Geeks' folks may have sought him out, but Cera strikes his own balance between Freak and Geek, hottie and nerd. For sure some girls love him, because he is sweet, and he continues here to show the same alarmingly authentic-seeming quiet straightforwardness. Cera's line readings are so well timed and simple they feel like it's a real person talking. With his understated but original looks and style he's a born movie actor, a young Jimmy Stewart for our times. I hope people will remember Michael Cera better from this movie than the traveling wad of gum. But I don't know. I hope I will. But the mind can play tricks on you.",7,4,10,4 October 2008
There Will Be Blood," Paul Thomas Anderson's stunning epic of ego and greed
","Using as a starting point Upton Sinclair's novel 'Oil!' but deriving his hero also from Von Stroheim's silent classic, 'Greed,' based on Frank Norris' novel, 'McTeague,' Anderson has made an epic set in the first quarter of the twentieth century about one overweaning and titanically determined individual whose life is dominated, whether he chooses or not, by America's two great obsessions: money and religion.The scarily intense actor Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Daniel Plainview, a self-made millionaire who gets rich as an oilman so he can put distance between himself and people, the majority of whom he hates with a ferocity equaling his ambition. His enemy/doppelganger/nemesis is Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) a young healer/preacher who draws his congregation from the inhabitants of Plainview's oil drilling land. Mysteriously, Sunday's identical brother Paul (also Dano) is the one who shows up early on and persuades Plainview to pay him a tidy sum to know where his family's land is, because there is a lot of oil boiling up on it. This leads to the series of claims and land-grabs that occupy the rest of the story.Plainview has no clear origins. The ultimate self-made man, he emerges from the soil like some primordial creature. We first see him digging for silver, going down into the bowels of the earth and eating dinner crouched like a primate in the opening segment of Kubrick's 2001, which Anderson's haunting prologue, with its wonderful use of the music by Jonny Greenwood that flows through, unmistakably evokes. The film will suggest and draw on many other sources, Stevens' 'Giant,' shot like this near Marfa, Texas, Welles' 'Citizen Kane,' John Huston and his classic film of B. Traven's 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre;' and many more.. An electrical tone dominates the air as if the whole landscape were alive with some terrible unknown power--the power to be exploited, dominated, but a power that can backfire and destroy its exploiters. Plainview's relation is with the land, to take its riches and make himself rich. People are to be dealt with and told whatever story convinces them to do what he needs. He is a character so cold and inhuman and intense in his relationship with money that he is ready for one of the deepest bolgias of Dante's Inferno, and sometimes he already seems to be there. Early on, the hero crawls out of the hole he's dug badly injured, sliding along the ground like the damaged mountain climber in the documentary, 'Touching the Void.' It's as if he's been into Hell and come out for a spell, to strut and walk upon P.T. Anderson's stage. As enigmatic as Welle's Charles Foster Kane, we watch him with fear of what he may do next.Day-Lewis seems to simultaneously declaim and chew his words, as if he wants to spew them out but then bites them back, and thus Day-Lewis draws attention to his every utterance but also gives consistency to a character who otherwise isn't predictable. Strangest of all, for somebody who's such a hostile egomaniac, you wouldn't expect him so often to speak polite, cajoling words. 'I don't like to explain myself' however is the truest thing he says.The movie's epic battle is, in a sense, a false one: it's not between God and Mamon, but between Mamon and a tainted, ersatz God, because Eli Sunday is a charlatan, a mountebank. Dano's church scenes are theatrical and absurd but convincing. Anderson is 'great with actors,' which means letting them open up to their fullest potential and taking risks with them. Dano is a risk, and himself takes risks. Day-Lewis chews up the landscape, mouthing and intoning his every line in what seems an evocation of Huston as Noah Cross in Polanski's Chinatown. He is extreme, but his conviction is so great that he convinces. Even if he didn't, he would be fun to watch from first to last. Life in the old West is life on another, alternate planet where people could and did make their own rules; Anderson's actors make theirs. Strangely, as much as Plainview hates people, he allows himself to be humiliated, when it is necessary to serve his aims. And this is where Eli Sunday comes in.Though the mood of mystery and potentially of 'There Will Be Blood' is long sustained, Anderson has some history of having trouble with endings and has sometimes resorted to desperate measures to conclude with drama, most notably the plague of frogs in 'Magnolia.' That is a biblical tale, and the Bible is another source: Daniel Plainview is like some Old Testament prophet raining down destruction and reaping gold. In the finale of this film, Anderson relies heavily on Dano, a young and relatively inexperienced actor. Dano is strange and powerful, but somehow as an adversary he seems inadequate, as does the final confrontation between the two men. There is nothing like the magisterial ominousness of the movie's introduction, but that is such a remarkable achievement that it resonates long in the mind. No other movie this year so grips you and holds you riveted in its spell as this one.And all the way through there are wonderful scenes, mostly out of doors and around oil wells. There are Plainview's tense, teeming meetings with people whose land he wants or cooperation he needs to stake out new claims. The burning geyser is most notable, a sequence whose exact composition and flowing camera movement doesn't keep it from having singular urgency. The man goes around with an innocent-faced boy called H.W. (Dillon Freasier) he has raised from a baby, lacing his bottle with whiskey. H.W. stands silently by in Plainfield's public appearances to make him look like a family man; but there is no wife. Later there is a mysterious man ((Kevin J. O'Connor) who appears saying he's the oilman's half brother. When both these relationships deteriorate, horribly, Plainview is finally alone with his adversaries.",10,6,21,27 December 2007
Downfall," Not much fun in this Hell
","The Germans have finally made a World War II movie with Hitler in it as a main character, hitherto a taboo for them, like showing Queen Elizabeth in a movie for the English, presumably for different reasons. Hirshbiegel's film gives us Hitler's last days in an unpalatable mix of generals, women, children murdered to save them from a world without National Socialism, Berlin crumbling around the Führer's meandering bunker, booms and crashes echoing around the auditorium.The result is a harrowing and powerful but also plodding. It's as if director Hirschbiegel was so focused on just getting all the terror, gloom, and horror of it down on film he didn't step back to breathe. There's not much sense of pacing or rhythm. There's a steady unwinding, of course -- after all this is the devolution to end all devolutions -- but there's not much suspense or sense of calculated contrast between successive scenes. Maybe there isn't any room for art in such a story. But then you have to ask why 'Downfall' was made, and the only answer is to provide some kind of catharsis for German viewers.The director has epic ambitions. He not only covers the moods of the bunker on every level from general down to the lowest orderly (it's 'Upstairs Downstairs' all played below), but also takes us up to street level where Berlin crumbles as the Russians move in, and it dives through battlefield hospitals teeming with moaning, screaming wounded and grizzled, exhausted surgeons sawing off limbs. (Why does the camera ritually shake every time there's a big explosion? It's a fake-looking effect.) We see so many people pop cyanide pills and blow their brains out it becomes almost routine. And we are witnesses to the kind of terrible battlefield gore we saw in Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' and more recently in Jeunet's 'Very Long Engagement.'But in fact, in 'Downfall's' foreground, inside Hitler's bunker, there's no real action except the decision to do nothing, not to yield, to go down with the ship. This is the Endgame, the checkmate: the 'king' is cornered. There's a lot of talk about escaping or surrendering but neither is going to happen. It all stays in the bunker till the end. Consequently the movie is character-driven, and succeeds best in impersonating known figures.Most importantly, Hirschbiegel has engaged a marvelous actor, Bruno Ganz, to play a fully rounded version of the doomed Hitler. Over-saturated color and ill judged sickly lighting -- however accurate a reproduction the latter may be of the underground setting -- make the generals look like waxworks, but Ganz's Hitler is three-dimensional and has all the qualities ever attributed to him. He screams and yelps at the generals in a voice uncannily right, he's soft as a puppy-dog with women and children; and there are all stages of madness and folly and denial in between. Ganz can do as much with his face seen from the side as he can do with his stooped exhausted body, his twittering left hand hidden behind his back, and his voice rasping and cawing as he curses his generals, brags of dealing with the Jews, and condemns the German people to die -- but mild and soothing to the strangely cheerful Eva Braun, and sweet and forgiving as he hires a secretary. This is no mere impersonation: it makes Hitler real and complex.That's disturbing to many viewers, especially Jewish ones, who have protested this movie should not even have been made; that even to look Hitler in the eye and see a human being taints the memory of the millions who died in the camps. But this is wrong. We don't need a cardboard man to know the Nazis were the personification of evil. The hard truth of evil's banality -- and commonality -- was dramatized by Hannah Arendt's reportage of the Eichmann trial in 1963.After suicides have happened and corpses have been torched and officers have left to fight over whether to surrender, 'Downfall' narrates a terrifying escape by several women, including Traudl Junge, Hitler's young secretary, beyond the Russian soldiers and out of Berlin. There's a little poetry -- perhaps the only moment when the movie sings in any conventional sense -- when Junge, already seen in Heller and Schmiderer's documentary, 'Blind Spot,' two years ago (to which this film owes much), escapes hand in hand with a small blond boy and cycles cross-country with him under a bright clear open sky (escapes, as the documentary shows, to a lifetime of guilt). Finally here is contrast, a flight from the bunker that sets off the grim experiences we've witnessed inside it.Unfortunately, though, we've already seen so many cinematic depictions of depraved Nazi officers getting drunk amid naked girls (a classic version is Visconti's lugubrious and cloying 'The Damned') that even when Eva Braun is one of the celebrants there's a numbed sense of déjà vu. Outside the bunker, up above, the dark sequences of mere children in soldier's uniforms playing the doomed hero are disgusting and heartbreaking, but that was an aspect of the final days of the Nazis that had its ultimate cinematic expression long ago in Berhhard Wicki's powerful 1959 anti-war movie, 'Die Brücke.' No, the only thing that makes 'Downfall' different is the bunker, and Hirschbiegel might have done better to have stayed down there and never let us out. Hitler certainly never got out, except to be incinerated so the Allies wouldn't get his corpse. This is not a great movie, but it's a powerful one. It deserves to be seen, if you can handle the claustrophobic nightmares it may give you.",Null,3,9,14 March 2005
The Last King of Scotland," Toxic temptations
","In this film Kevin Macdonald, a Scot, directs James McAvoy, a Scot, as Nicholas Garrigan, a brash, spirited, and foolish young doctor just out of medical school in the early 1970's who overnight becomes a close associate of Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker), the new dictator of Uganda. Amin had served in the British army and developed an admiration for the Scots. He gave himself the title 'His Excellency President for Life Field Marshal Al Hadji Dr. Idi Amin, VC, DSO, MC, King of Scotland, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular.' He liked to dress his soldiers in kilts and have them sing Scottish songs.Before this Macdonald made Touching the Void and other documentaries, including One Day in September, about the Munich Israeli Olympic team massacre. This film, which is not a documentary and departs freely from fact at least at certain key points, is based on the 1997 novel by Giles Foden, which concerns the doctor. But Macdonald's writers, including Jeremy Brock, who penned Mrs. Brown, and Peter Morgan, who scripted Frears' The Queen, have jazzed up the more bland original character and made him younger and bolder. Garrigan has picked Uganda at random. He is attractive and dashing: he's already flirting with the pretty blonde wife of the head of the rural medical clinic he's come to work in, when he's grabbed, with her, to 'save' the paranoid Amin. The newly ascended President for Life has hurt his hand in an accident involving a farmer's cow. Garrigan impresses Amin by not just calmly fixing his sprained hand but also grabbing his presidential pistol and putting the cow out of its misery.When Amin learns Nicholas is a Scot, he takes off his military shirt complete with medals and trades it on the spot for a 'Scotland' T-shirt Nicolas is wearing -- for his son, Campbell. Amin has another son named Macgregor.Almost immediately thereafter Amin persuades the young doctor to leave the clinic and become his personal physician in Kampala, the capital (where the movie was shot), sets him up with a Mercedes and a posh apartment in the presidential compound, and makes him a most trusted consultant, allowing him to decide on the design for a major building. Observing this exceptional access, a cynical British diplomat (Simon McBurney) approaches Nicholas and cautions him to 'keep in touch,' an offer the young man initially rebuffs.Garrigan's seduced, as are we, initially, by Amin's charisma and charm, and only gradually does he become skeptical and eventually horrified as he realizes he's the intimate of a ferocious dictator who, estimates say, killed off 300,000 of his citizens, as well as expelling all the Asians from the country. What's interesting is how the daring young man as we see him can hardly help being thus seduced; how the two men seduce each other. But Nicholas is in a terribly weak position when things go wrong. Whitaker and McAvoy play off each other nicely as they act out this process.Several dramatic events involving Garrigan in the two-hour film's latter segment strain credulity, including the way the young doctor's escape is intertwined with the Entebbe plane hijacking incident, and the kinds of trouble he gets into on the way to that escape.What makes this film, whose plot line can scarcely compete with that of the more multi-leveled and thought-provoking The Constant Gardener, and which has a grainy newsreel look that's undistinguished, is Forest Whitaker's astonishing performance as Idi Amin Dada. Whitaker usually plays soft spoken, sensitive types. This time he nails a range from fearful to seductive to terrifying, connecting them with a seamlessly explosive energy. One would say Whitaker is this picture, except that it's unmistakably also young McAvoy's. Essential to the film is the way McAvoy, who's had mostly more minor and more purely physical roles before (he was the fawn in Narnia) plays off Whitaker beautifully and woos us too with his convincing enthusiasm and dash. This is a very watchable but also disturbing movie which one wishes might have maintained greater verisimilitude. When documentarians embroider the truth, sometimes they go off way too far. But this is not unusual: a great performance in a less-than-great movie. We have to take what we can get, and in The Last King of Scotland we get a very wild ride.",8,63,80,30 September 2006
American Gangster," Superfly gets a posh makeover
","Scott's flashy, energetic gangster biopic loosely follows the story of a real black drug importer and dealer of late Sixties, early Sevenities Harlem. Frank Lucas (played by Denzel Washington with his usual rush of energy and charisma) did indeed learn the ropes of organized crime from his black boss Bumpy Johnson, did import drugs from Southeast Asia using military connections, did bring his North Carolina family up to be his network for heroin distribution, and was brought down by cops and made deals with Ritchie Roberts (played with his usual conviction and strength by Russell Crowe). Moreover Roberts and Lucas did work together to bring down various dealers and crooked cops--and get Lucas off with only 15 (or maybe fewer) years in jail, not served consecutively.One can't help being of two minds about this film. In many ways it's just another gangster movie, and scenes in it will awaken memories of many others of the genre. It's hard to consider the black Superfly hero exactly a new creation either, Lucas reportedly he was not really the wealthiest or most successful black drug dealer, though he's made to seem so here. (The real Lucas reportedly was a definite presence in the shooting of the film and in the views of others is responsible for a number of distortions of the facts.) But the director of Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise, Gladiator and Black Hawk Down is not your average crap film director. He is a crap film director who can produce the occasional cult classic, and who awakens disturbed admiration even at times when his effort is somehow revolting. This film has great momentum and confidence, and its first half is a pleasure to watch. As seen here, and in the tall, regal embodiment of Denzel Washington, Frank Lucas is more than a top-dog gangster. He's a black hero and a bold economic pioneer, because he explicitly steps forth from the mold set by his mentor, Bumpy (Clarence Williams III in the film) to bypass the Italians and sell pure heroin, his own trademarked brand, at a lower price than the adulterated stuff on the street-- bypassing the usual wholesalers and setting up his own distribution system. And yet, while establishing a purely black business, he followed Italisn traditions in making that business his own kind of cosa nostra--once again a family concern, with his own mother (a glossily distinguished old lady) brought up to preside over a huge white plantation-style manse, taken over, refurbished in an elegant Afro style, and manned by discreet southern black crooks.So what we have here is a very hollow victory for Black liberationists. A black man who achieved the distinction of feeding heroin to Harlem's addicts all by himself, without white supervision or control. Hooray. While the movie avoids a great deal of gratuitous brutality (and the mass killing spree is carried out at the end by the cops, wiping out Luicas' main heroin packaging station), he is clear a very cruel man, capable of bashing in or blowing off a head at a moment's notice.Whatever distortion there may be, the glorification of the hero being the most morally dubious one, there are some convincing factual elements. Generally speaking an early-Seventies feel is nicely achieved through the use of down-tinted color and many, but not overstated, period outfits and hairdos. It's also an interesting point brought out in Scott's occasionally documentary-style passages that in the early Seventies American soldiers were returning Stateside in droves addicted to opium or heroin; that their various R&R points (notably Bangkok) obviously were well supplied with these drugs and accustomed to purveying them to Americans; and that (in the film anyway) Lucas went in country himself to find and cut a deal with a local kingpin, using a military cousin as the future intermediary. This is bold and original, but the boldest and most original stroke of all was to bypass organized crime. An independent businessman? The essence of American entrepreneur-ism? Hooray again.There appears to be exaggeration and blurring of facts in the depiction of Russell Crowe's character, New Jersey crime fighter Ritchie Roberts, as a noble yet flawed opponent. Here Lucas may not have influenced the final cut, since he reportedly says Ritchie was a man who could not have arrested his own mother. It's really at the end that Ritchie stepped in to cut deals as a prosecutor, and the cops who worked to bring Lucas down are underplayed or demonetize.Again as in New Jack City and some other films we're treated to repeated shots of a Harlem heroin packing plant staffed by naked nubile black women. Maybe they're essential to the story? How much is mythology here? Relatives of the real Ritchie say he wasn't a deadbeat dad as reported, because he wasn't a dad at all, and also not a philanderer. There is so much departure from the facts here, and yet the ending with its ritual string of on screen text-message follow-ups is mechanical and anti-climactic. Accomplished as it is, Scott's compellingly grand new black gangster movie is finally just another link in a conventional chain.",8,0,2,21 November 2007
The Reader," Storytelling troubles
","This isn't meet-cute. Fifteen-year-old schoolboy Michael Berg (David Kross) first encounters his 36-year-old future lover Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) by throwing up in her doorway. It's a dismal rainy day in a German city in 1958 and he has taken ill on the way home from school. She cleans him up and accompanies him to his family. He turns out to have scarlet fever, and is kept at home for months. Once he's well again he goes back carrying a bunch of flowers to thank Hanna for her kindness, but realizes he's turned on, and bolts in embarrassment while she's bathing. Eventually Michael returns and happily loses his virginity. A regular ritual of reading, bathing, and lovemaking develops between him and Hanna. He reads to her; she bathes him; the sex is mutual. She is a tram conductor with a harsh manner, and several huge secrets. She seems to be using Michael, but she's also enjoying him mightily, and he is reaping enormous rewards, though his affair puts pressure on his relations with family and schoolmates.Bernhard Schlink's original The Reader was an international bestseller. A lawyer and judge who writes, Schlink departed from his usual detective stories with this novel that becomes a meditation on Nazism--the denial of the surviving participants and the incomprehension of Germans like Michael who were born in the aftermath. Michael's feelings toward Hanna become much more complicated than simply those of a youth introduced to love by an older woman--as complicated as the feelings of Germans about the demons in their modern past. As for Hanna, she seems to understand nothing and to be more concerned about how she appears than what she has done.The book is in three parts. First there is the love affair of the schoolboy and the tram conductor, which ends abruptly and painfully when Hanna suddenly disappears. In the second part it's eight years later and Michael is a law student attending trials of Nazis with fellow students and their seminar teacher, Professor Rohl (Bruno Ganz). One day the young man is horrified and riveted to learn one of the defendants is none other than his long lost Hanna. She turns out to have been an SS guard at a satellite of Auschwitz and she's on trial with five other women for allegedly allowing several hundred prisoners to burn to death locked inside a church. This trial paralyzes Michael. He has never gotten over his first, interrupted love idyll with Hanna. Now he is filled with guilt for having loved her but also a sense that he should help her when he realizes he has information that might lower her sentence.The last part, thirty years later, consists of several brief visits by Michael, first to Hanna in prison, then to the posh Manhattan flat of a Jewish woman, Rose Mather (Lena Olin), who was at the trial. She was one of the survivors and wrote a book about her experiences that was used in evidence. This provides a kind of coda.Schlink's novel is neat and arresting, a page-turner that conceivably makes you think. Its Holocaust issues are cunningly intertwined with a sensuous--and rather peculiar--coming-of-age story told by a sensitive man still struggling to understand his experience and his country's. I read the book with interest, but found it a bit contrived. This together with Stephen Daldry's previous choice to film Michael Cunningham's The Hours shows a weakness on the English director's part for stories that are a little too clever and schematic.This time the screenplay by the British playwright David Hare does damage to the book by altering its chronology, chopping it up and muddling the original linear three-part structure. Hare has said in interviews that the interpolated device of Michael's telling his story to his grown daughter was necessary to make sense of his voice-over. (That,however, is debatable.) Having settled on this device, Hare felt obligated to keep interjecting the mature Michael, played by Ralph Fiennes, at points throughout the film. The omnipresence of Fiennes' glum face undermines the sense of the young Michael's eagerness and, later, shock and confusion.Fiennes as Michael revisits a cosmetically aged Kate Winslet as Hanna three decades later when she is about to be released from prison. Michael could never bring himself to visit her, but sent her tapes of himself reading the same books he read to her during their affair. Fiennes is a cold fish, hard to relate to the lively and sweet personality of young David Kross.The film is hampered from the outset by its use of the outmoded artifice of dramatizing a story that takes place in another country and another language and yet having everyone speak English, with several of the main characters played by Brits (Winslet, Fiennes) putting on German accents. Bruno Ganz speaks with less of a German accent than they do.There is much of interest in this glossy production, beautifully photographed on location by two of the best DP's in the business, Chris Menges and Roger Deakins. Ganz's professor is an ambiguous, subtle characterization. But since the drama of the unfolding story has been destroyed by breaking it up into pieces, the only thing that remains alive and beautiful and strange are the love scenes between Kross and Winslet. There is good chemistry between the 18-year-old Kross and the 34-year-old Winslet, and their nude scenes are bold and intimate. It's only when the machinery of what Schlink and the filmmakers are trying to tell us about German guilt and denial goes into action that things begin to be clunky and cold. Unfortunately, that is a big part of the picture.",7,90,131,26 December 2008
The Wrestler," Charisma, heart, and hard work make a comeback of a has-been
","Billed as Mickey Rourke's big comeback, this film is the finale presentation of the New York Film Festival 2008. Awarded in Venice and shown at Toronto, it features a winning performance by Rourke. It's a simple story, a mixture of raw authenticity and old fashioned corn about a washed up professional wrestler who's 20 years past his prime and resists admitting it till he has a heart attack and is forced t turn to the only two people he has in his life, a lap dancer and an estranged daughter. It's pretty monochromatic and claustrophobic, but the tiny framework shows off Rourke's generous, authoritative performance. Rourke's weathered, soulful face and sweet-sad smile sell the movie.Early scenes establish that Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Rourke), who has long graying bleach-blond hair and wears a hearing aid, still has fans from his heyday in the 80's and warm contacts in the pro wrestler community of today, who give him work on weekends. He's well liked (kids in his neighborhood clamor around him), and takes life's hard knocks with patience--and that smile.But all is not well. The first night we see him after a fight locked out of his trailer because he owes the manager money. He lives alone, has a shaky relationship with a lap dancer, work name Cassidy (Marisa Tomei). His lesbian daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), who's in school, despises him for not being there when he was needed. We're in the world of numbed pain and charred, sealed-away emotions here.The second evening of fights pits the Ram against an S/M wrestler who uses a staple gun on him, and broken glass, and barbed wire. Ram collapses after this fight and wakes up in intensive care after a bypass operation. The hospital is the real beginning of the film, though Rourke and the filmmakers are over-committed to the wrestling scene, and stage more painful and realistic bouts, in which all the fighters other than Rourke were professionals.Ram realizes he's not the man he was. The doctor has told him he can't wrestle any more. He tries to jog and can't. Helpless and alone, he turns to Cassidy (whose real name is Pam), but she is reluctant to admit he's more than a customer. He visits his daughter, but she is extremely hostile. In just a couple scenes, Evan Rachel Wood is raw and powerful. Tomei is authentic too, having mastered the lap-dancing technique and assimilated its world's mix of sensuality and distance. Rourke/Ram's encounters with both women are painful and memorable.There's a good sense of context, even though Ram's world as shown is narrow. 'The 90's f----ing sucked!' he exclaims to Cassidy when he finally coaxes her into having a beer with him outside the club. He hates that bastard Kurt Cobain. Axel Rose was The Man. You realize she's as washed up as he is. She has a 9-year-old kid and wants to quit and somehow get into a condo.The screenplay by Roy Siegel, an original editor of The Onion, has lightness and humor to undercut the melodrama and doom. Ram is a laugh when, after the heart attack, he starts working longer hours at the Jersey Dollar's deli counter, doling out potato salad and ham, joking with the man and flattering the women.Finally after he is pushed away by Cassidy/Pam, on a bad day at the deli, Ram flashily quits and calls a promoter and countermands his resignations, saying the re-match with 'The Ayatollah' is on again. The Aronofsky of 'Requiem for a Dream' set a record for determinism, and it's hard not to see this Wrestler as doomed. But the filmmakers' and and cast's involvement in the milieu and Rourke's humility and charm undercut that enough so the final sequence is uncertain and interesting. And all the fights are good.The title 'The Wrestler' can be generic because unlike boxing films, wrestling ones are rare, indeed nonexistent. Rourke himself is a boxer; the switchover wasn't easy, but he had the athletic background, and not only that, the has-been life of his character, a washed-up star in an activity looked down on by all but rabid fans. Few think of it even as a sport, though it requires conditioning and skill and involves constant injuries. In the NYFF Q&A Rourke conveyed a sense of his respect for this activity as a sport, and Aronofsky reported that his work on the mat won the approval of the pros. If this is an iconic performance as some are saying, it's not just Rourke's personal identification with the character's comeback mode, but good hard technical work to make it all authentic.",8,67,107,2 October 2008
Hancock," Tarnishing the image
","John Hancock (Will Smith), known universally as Hancock, is an alcoholic bum. But wait! He's a superhero. He can fly, he is super-powerful, he can catch bad guys. Let's put it this way: Hancock is a superhero in need of a recovery program. Besides his drinking he has rage issues. And he just isn't very nice. He also is very, very messy. In the course of one of his rescue missions he usually causes millions of dollars in unnecessary damage. The media is full of complaints about all this.And that's where PR man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) comes in. They meet when Hancock saves Ray from being run over in his car by a train (of course Hancock also wrecks the train and smashes up a lot of vehicles caught in the surrounding traffic jam). Hancock takes Ray home (with his messed up car, through the air) and gets to know Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and little boy Aaron (Jae Head). Superheros do eat, and Hancock develops an instant jones for Mary's 'spaghetti madness' dinners.The upshot of this rather unusual encounter determines the rest of the movie. Ray sets to work to remake Hancock's image and his behavior. At Ray's urging Hancock turns himself in to do prison time for all the laws he has broken (it seems superheroes can be subject to the law as well as the pleasures of pasta). In the clink, Hancock's thrown in with some pretty rough characters. He goes to meetings where men share about their problems but time after time he just says 'pass' when it comes to him.Eventually Hancock cleans up his act in more ways than one. Released because he's needed by the city, he learns to say 'Good job' to overwhelmed cops he's helping, shaves, gets a haircut, washes, cuts down on the booze, and wears a nice tight leather superman outfit Ray has provided. Maybe the 'good jobs' are the most important pert.Ray's success with Hancock leads the corporations to get back in touch with Ray about his pet scheme to have them give away billions to end disease and poverty in return for sporting a giant heart symbol that will make people love them. Meanwhile a rather unusual relationship is developing between Hancock and Mary. But we can't talk about that because it's meant to be a surprise. It is a surprise. It's also ridiculously far-fetched and elaborate and requires pages of expository dialogue. And that's where 'Hancock,' which was fading once Hancock turned nice, fizzles out. The final rounds of CGI and derring-do and bangs and smashes are redundant, because they don't develop Hancock's initial premise any more.The interest of that premise was that perfection is boring. The gods of the ancient Greeks had lots of imperfections, and a superman who sleeps on a city bench in a grungy watch cap with an eagle on it, grumpy and reeking of alcohol, is intriguing. It's also potentially a little bit repulsive, especially given Hancock's foul language. A little human weakness is appealing, but we don't really want our heroes to be quite such a mess, and there's a mean and sadistic streak to Hancock that is troubling.The character of Ray helps to counteract this. Jason Bateman, a guy who has done a lot of TV and is best known for his role in 'Arrested Development,' has a resilient nice-guy quality and at times Ray seems to be the main character and Hancock just his project. But should that be? We turn away from Hancock because his character is skewed too far to begin with. Nonetheless the movie deserves credit for taking the superhero idea in a whole new direction, and so does Will Smith for running with it, and the equally charismatic Theron for tagging along.Once Hancock gets all cleaned up and people start to like him we realize this isn't enough, and so did the writers. Unfortunately where they go from there was boring and comes from a more conventional and hokey kind of superhero movie. We want to know more about Hancock--we want to know what has become of his humanness--and instead we're getting lectured about angels and millennia.Will Smith is a superstar--never mind the hero part--and people are flocking to see this movie because of him. But Hancock coats him with a layer of meanness and grumpiness that keeps the Will Smith charisma from coming out the way it does in his best performances, most recently and notably in 'The Pursuit of Happiness' and 'I Am Legend.' And unfortunately Peter Berg, whose last outing was the ham-handed 'The Kingdom,' has yet to show much finesse as a director. It's hard to tell in the end how much of the messiness is due to the out-of-whack superhero and how much is just a lack of directorial restraint. And yet you've got to admire both Berg and Smith for attempting to take an old theme in a new direction.",7,0,1,10 July 2008
Ray," Perfect mimicry, at the right time
","'Biopics Set to Rule the Oscars,' a headline reads. But are any of them great movies? That's a tough one. We've got J.M.Barrie in Marc Foster's touching Finding Neverland, Bobby Darren in Kevin Spacey's astonishing (and intermittently successful) ego-fest Beyond the Sea, Scorsese's dashing, high-rolling neurotic epic about Howard Hughes The Aviator, and we've got Taylor Hackford's Ray. Why is it that Ray seems the most significant as a biography? There are a number of reasons. Ray Charles died this year, for some of us far eclipsing Ronald Reagan and reminding us how great he was and will remain as a figure of American and world-wide music. He's the most endearing figure (artistically) of the lot, currently the most universally important American musical artist to be memorialized. And the movie is an unmitigated celebration of the man and his art. We can't question his importance to us or the enduring power of his recordings.Jamie Foxx, who plays Ray Charles in the movie, has had a breakout year with three big roles in the superb Michael Mann noir Collateral, in Ray, and in the slim but winning entertainment, Breakin' All the Rules. Foxx is now a certifiable movie star. Is he going to be a great actor? We'll see. But he has the power to dominate a movie screen. His Ray rarely reveals true emotion: even when he's being bitter and combative with business associates his face is a grinning mask. Foxx's performance doesn't scream and beg for our attention the way Kevin Spacey's does or sport the flash and grandeur of diCaprio's, but it has presence. It's remarkably assured and skillful, at once forthright and self-effacing. (In the context of Spacey's Darren, you notice that.) Foxx's imitation of Ray Charles Robinson (and it is an act of mimicry, like Will Smith's Ali) -- of his voice, movements, and especially that rolling, pigeon-toed walk -- is uncannily evocative. It's a cold, detached, performance, but Ray Charles -- cut off from the world by his drugs, his blindness, his genius, his invincible will to thrive -- was a detached man. Note also that except for a brief imaginary sequence, Foxx has to do all his acting with his eyes covered by big dark glasses.Flashbacks show how Ray saw his younger brother drown in a washtub and failed to save him and then went blind. Is there a connection? This isn't explored, but it's made clear that abject poverty, trauma and guilt certainly fed into Charles's heroin addiction and drinking. It looks like he continued to drink and smoke marijuana after kicking heroin; but the movie paints its pictures in broad strokes, without defining what did and didn't happen, what is and isn't known as a documentary might do. The young actor who plays Ray as a boy and the actress who plays Ray's mother are both touching and good.Much of Ray, aside from focusing on how the music came to be, is about how Charles fought to foil those who would like to cheat him, and later, to limit his artistic scope. This is heavily stressed in early scenes where a woman acts as his first 'manager,' making all arrangements and providing free lodging but demanding sexual favors and syphoning off most of his pay for herself. He insists on one-dollar bills so he can count them, and later this leads to conflict and spurs his departure for Seattle -- the farthest he could get from Florida where he's been all along up till now -- where he meets Quincy Jones and begins a freer musical life. His hard bargaining comes up when he goes from the small, jazz-oriented Atlantic to the big ABC-Paramount label and he demands ownership of the masters of his disks, a thing even Frank Sinatra didn't have. It's made clear that when Charles records with strings with ABC, it wasn't their choice but a new format he chose (and with fine results, as was the case with Charlie Parker). The movie doesn't go into the actual detail of all the labels Ray worked with.What emerges in the artistic portrait is what we already know: that Ray Charles turned songs of every genre, soul, pop, gospel, or country, into gold -- and into something purely his own; a universal piece of music: a Ray Charles song. His versions of 'Georgia' and 'Yesterday' are equally classic and unforgettable, better than anybody else's and beyond time. Unfortunately, his 'Yesterday' isn't included in the movie, which otherwise does hit most of the high spots for us. But the historical arc of the biopic also shows us that Charles wasn't always Charles but more of a Nat Cole clone when he first gained attention on the 'Chinlin' Circuit' -- till he began recording with Atlantic and Ahmet Ertegun guided him to a distinctive, gutsier style beginning with stride piano and a song Ertegun himself had written. (The Beyond the Sea Bobby Darren biopic has an Ertegun (the actually Turkish Tayfun Bademsoy) who looks more like the real McCoy than Ray's Curtis Armstrong.) The rest of the story is women and drugs, plus the childhood traumas and lessons his mamma taught him. He had many women; his wife never went on the road. He was barely present as a father. His main 'road' woman was an alcoholic singer who died of a heroin overdose, a tragedy Ray shares on screen with his wife. Ray himself became a heroin addict early on and remained one till the feds caught him returning from Canada. He was also a heavy smoker and many scenes are atmospherically wreathed in smoke.It's not Foxx's fault -- or Taylor Hackford's either -- that Will Smith in Ali had more warmth and charisma; that's the difference between the men.",Null,1,4,1 January 2005
Defiance," Hath not a Jew cojones?
","On the fringes of what is now Belarus in World War II after their family was slaughtered by Nazis and Polish collaborators in December 1941, the Jewish Bielski brothers fled to the forest and hid out there to fight Germans and the collaborators and save fellow Jews. Gradually many joined them from the ghetto in nearby Navahrudak, a town just seized from Poland by the Soviets. The tough, feisty Bielskis took in everyone, including the 'malbushim,' handicapped or weak ones not able fight. When the Germans were defeated in the summer of 1944, there were 1200 Jewish forest survivors that had been saved by the 'Bielski Brigade.' This puts the Bielskis on a level with Oscar Schindler. But their story isn't as well known. Nor, as it turns out, is this movie as powerful as Spielberg's 'Schindler's List. ''Defiance' has intense moments, a few of which are as sweet and plaintive as something out of Italian neo-realism, but the effort as a whole is conventional, unsubtle, and unmemorable. What a pity. All those good actors; all that slogging through cold water; all those scenes in the snow of people wearing gloves with the fingers out.We've had a spate of year's end WWII movies with Europeans incongruously talking English: 'Valkyrie,' manned by Brits but with Tom Cruise at the helm; 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas', where the Nazis all have plummy English accents; 'The Reader', where Winslett and Fiennes sound more Teutonic than the authentically German David Kross and Bruno Ganz. This time actors talk English with fake Eastern European accents but have whole conversations in Russian. These are compromises that, despite lingering resistance to subtitles, seem more and more retro and naive.As Joshua Rothkopf points out, 'Defiance' is a far cry from 'Holocaust hand-wringing' like 'Reader' and 'Striped Pajamas.' It's an example of the new 'Hebrews-kicking-ass sub-genre' like Spielberg's 'Munich.' 'Defiance,' Rothkopf says, 'is history made over into wish-fulfillment psychodrama, into 'Exodus.'' This is seen in the casting of high-profile bad-ass Daniel Craig as Tuvia Bielski, the Brigade's leader, and the way his brother Zus (Lief Schrieber) dances around mowing down legions with a machine gun like the mad Israeli comrade in the 1982 Lebanon war described in 'Waltz with Bashir.' The timing seems unfortunate, with the slaughter of Palestinians by Jews in Gaza that just took place. Macho Jews we know about. What this movie may make you wonder is why more Jews didn't have these qualities when the Nazis were exterminating them.As Tuvia Craig gets to show a vulnerability his made-over version of 007 lacks. After a severe illness, Tuvia falters as leader and almost collapses. You can see why after twice playing Bond, Craig couldn't resist a role of more complex humanity. Tuvia's firebrand opponent is brother Zus (Schreiber), whose desire for retribution leads him to abandon the forest enclave to fight with Russian partisans for a long period. This is a reverse opportunity to get tough and physical, since he's famous for playing Hamlet on stage. Asael (Jamie Bell) is a younger, more innocent Bielski who provides a thread of shy romance when he and the pretty, plucky Chaya (Mia Wasikowska) gradually fall in love. Bell has a present-ness and purity that come through well in this role. Alas, the movie plays the crude trick of trying to use cross-cutting to contrast Asael's forest wedding to Chaya with a violent shootout elsewhere in which Zus jumps about. Too often the movie's style is ham-handed but this is one of the worst moments. There were four Bielski brothers. The youngest, Aron (George MacKay), too young to lead, is so traumatized by witnessing his parents' slaughter that he cannot even speak.Perhaps where the movie most shines is in little vignettes of the rescued ghetto Jews. Alexa Davalos graces the screen as Lilka Ticktin, the beautiful woman who pairs off with Tuvia and nurses him through his illness. A watchmaker is asked to fix a rifle trigger, does so in an instant and is told 'you have a new job.' 'Everybody works,' they're told. There are the intellectual 'luftmensch' types who know how to play chess and dispute metaphysics but have difficulty driving a nail. The rabbi and the young leftist are certainly appealing, but too perfect and even too cute. As I'm not alone in noting, this is a story told to undermine Jewish stereotypes that ends by reinforcing them.According to accounts, the refugee camp, which had to move from time to time, came to include a kitchen, mill, bakery, bathhouse, synagogue, medical clinic, and 'a quarantine hut for those who suffered from infectious diseases such as typhus. Herds of cows supplied milk,' according to a Widipedia entry. Though it does show the Bielskis stealing food from local farmers and raiding a military HQ to get antibiotics, the movie focuses only on the early months of the Bielski Brigade. It's overwhelmed by the effort to show Zus mowing down Nazis and confronting his Soviet comrades' anti-Semitism while also following the hideaways' complicated and exhausting struggle to survive the winter. The clumsy cross-cutting sequence that chops up Asael's wedding only underlines this dilemma.'Defiance 'is pulled down by schematic staging, telegraphed plot points and obtrusive background music. In a directorial career that now includes nine films Zwick has had some good moments. He didn't do all that badly with his 1986 David Mamet adaptation, 'About Last Night,' 'Glory' was a Civil War epic that put him on the map and helped make a big star of Denzel Washington. 'Legends of the Fall' and 'The Siege' are different kinds of mush, but Zwick showed in 'Blood Diamond,' his last outing, that he can turn a potential potboiler into a rip-snorting action film with more than a dash of political awareness. The Bielski's story is one that matters and needed telling. But it flounders in conventionality and seems overwhelmed by the contrasts in its principals' personalities and experience.",6,4,10,21 January 2009
Lord of War," Jarring but kitsch, not conventional Hollywood, but not a great movie; good role for Cage
","This portrait of a big time arms dealer of Ukrainian origin, Yuri Orlov, starring Nicolas Cage (whose performance holds your attention throughout), has many schlocky Hollylwood elements, such as Yuri's druggie brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) and his trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan), his numerous sexy conquests along the way to megawealth, his 'friendship' with the dramatic president of Liberia (Eamonn Walker), and the ridiculously relentless and steely Interpol agent who pursues him (Ethan Hawke). All these are colorful exhibits rather then people. The slickness of the decor and cinematography impress pointlessly. Cage's narration is full of tendentious declarations, like 'The problem with dating dream girls is that they have a tendency to become real.' Or 'I would tell you to go to hell, but I think you're already there.' Some of the zingers fall flat or are just obvious, like 'I sell to leftists, and I sell to rightists. I even sell to pacifists, but they're not the most regular customers,' or 'There are two types of tragedies in life. One is not getting what you want, the other is getting it. ' There is more than enough of that, and you have to be pretty easily impressed to like it. The movie also sometimes revels in the evils it depicts. But it includes some significant home truths about world politics like the fact that the world's biggest arms dealers are the US, UK, France, Russia, and China, and they are also the permanent members of the UN Security Council. Some of the cynicism in this movie is pretty strong stuff. It certainly doesn't lull you.",7,9,12,26 February 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Not bad, for a travesty
","On the one hand turning Arthur Conan Doyle's cerebral Victorian detective into a scruffy action hero is a terrible idea (and formally speaking, a travesty). On the other hand, Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law (as Holmes and Watson) are (however dubious the conception) excellent in their roles, and this is the most coherent, as well as the most expensive, film the ham-handedly hip British director Guy Ritchie, perhaps most famous as Madonna's ex, has ever done.Having been steeped in Sherlock Holmes stories as a youth, I can recognize all the many trappings, characters, and ideas of the originals that are carried over into this Christmas Day blockbuster, while finding none of the original atmosphere and personalities here at all. Partly my sense of outrage is due to reading at least a very large chunk of an old but richly satisfying Complete Sherlock Holmes, a thick volume on tissue-thin India paper. Partly it's due to seeing various previous Holmes incarnations on film, which go back over a century. The preeminent incarnation was undoubtedly Basil Rathbone's tall, deep- voiced, long-faced version, with the big meerschaum pipe (now taken over by Tarantino's juicy Nazi villain Col. Landa), the tweeds, the cape-like overcoat, the deerstalker hat, and the traditional lines, of which 'Elementary, my dear Watson' is the most famous. Above all it was the voice, rich, resonant, elegantly West End English, utterly authoritative. Robert Downey Jr.'s staccato delivery is witty. It's not always quite audible. He's thrown away the deerstalker and the meerschaum for a straight black pipe and a bowler. And that's fine because he doesn't seem anything like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes. Downey Jr. likes to toss off his lines; sometimes they fall before we've caught them. He's bright and quick witted and his motormouthed manner has always been above all suited to keeping the ball rolling. He does that fine here, and he and Jude Law play off each other with excellent chemistry. It's all a lark. And a very well-tooled disaster. Because somehow the action of this actioner doesn't matter. The villain isn't really scary, the danger doesn't feel dangerous, the suspense isn't suspenseful. It's fast and skillful and complicated and loud and sometimes in its overly-dark processed way rather beautiful (like female interests Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly), but it doesn't grab you.It's okay to design a modern Sherlock Holmes, I guess. But if you do, why steep your movie in Victorian atmosphere? Ritchie's costly film, rich in CGI and spectacular action set pieces, is set in the grimiest of 19th century Londons, with an elegantly slovenly Sherlock Holmes to match. Every moment and every scene is designed to tell us this is Sherlock Holmes, but every moment of every scene has elements in it to tell us that Sherlock Holmes is absolutely what this is not.Traditionally Holmes is the quintessential intellectual sleuth. You've got that here. Robert Downey Jr's Holmes is a keen observer of detail; he can tell just by scrutinizing her person that Watson's fiancée has had a previous failed engagement -- much to her annoyance, and pointlessly; Watson already knew this. Holmes is also a clever inventor -- like his evil adversary, Lord Blackwood. (This individual is played by Mark Strong, who is the villain in two movies opening this week, this and Young Victoria, where he is the evil Lord Conroy. Is England short on villain material nowadays, or were all the other candidates working on a new political satire with Armando Iannucci and Peter Capaldi?)Anyway, the trouble with Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, which looks like it's set up for a sequel, judging by the way Holmes' perennial opponent Professor Moriarity is mentioned at the end, is not that anything whatsoever is left out. It's that nothing is left out, and on top of all the traditional trappings (slightly distorted, like turning the deerstalker into a bowler), too much is added, of a very distracting and inappropriate nature. All the details of 221B Baker Street and of Holmes and Watson, now locked into an amped-up love-hate relationship that needs a fiancée to save the pair from Brokeback Mountain overtones, are dutifully, if not lovingly, preserved, along with the rationcination and the battles of wits with a fiendishly malevolent opponent, only this has been plugged into an action movie matrix, with Holmes additionally transformed into a martial arts master skilled at bruising organs and smashing bones, and with this comes all the loud noise and speeded up and slowed down CGI-assisted footage and hypertrophied musical background complete with bangs and thumps. It's about like the way the disco team of Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band redid Beethoven's Fifth Symphony as 'A Fifth of Beethoven.'All this is great for action blockbuster fans. Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is a relief from the ponderous over-signifying of the genre. This is a lark, though sometimes a brutal one. But mostly as A.O. Scott says this movie Sherlock has 'loutish, laddish cool', and the movie is 'a series of 'poses and stunts' that are 'intermittently diverting.' But supposing you're a lover of Beethoven: how much will you get out of Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band? Not a whole lot. And ultimately there's not a whole lot here, which, come to think of it, despite all the extra millions added in the production this time, has always been true of Guy Ritchie's movies. Some people aren't very good, and yet they keep getting promoted to better-paying jobs. But it's not that Ritchie has no talent, and certainly not true that he has no energy. But as somebody said, his trouble is he doesn't care about character, theme, or even storytelling; he only cares about being cool. Here, he doesn't care about the mystery. And that's the answer to the mystery of why this movie leaves you cold.",6,7,16,27 December 2009
WALL·E," Little robot makes good
","Earth is overrun with trash. Thus a little rusty robot has his lovely task: packing rubbish from humans, who've departed to space, into skyscraper cubes. WALL-E is a 'he.' We just know. WALL stands for 'Waste Allocation' something-or-other (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), but of course it reads as 'Wally.' Wally looks a little like ET. Has some of the sprightliness of R2D2. Wally's in the survivor situation of Will Smith in I Am Legend, but has no vicious enemies, only a cockroach pal that follows him around. But Wally is lonely. Wally is a lonely guy.Animations anthropomorphize animals (as did ancient fables and the seventeenth-century poet La Fontaine), then moved on to broomsticks and other objects, and machines. Do machines have souls? Do androids dream of electric sheep? Will artificial intelligence rule? Will we have to rip out Hal's brain? These are perennial sci-fi dilemmas.WALL-E is a robot love story. It's also a chilling if hopeful picture of humans exiled from a ruined planet and turned into consumer blobs wallowing in a space mall called 'Axiom.' This movie oscillates neatly between austere minimalism and cornball sweetness, with many Star Wars battles smashed together in between. It satisfies children and adults, but only by not quite fully satisfying either. That is still an accomplishment, the classic Shakespearean one of appealing to all levels of the audience.Two ways WALL-E is wondrous are in the dusty, weathered look of its Pixar earth landscapes which Wally himself partakes of; and the endless mechanical business, the tricks and gestures of creatures and objects in constant, precise, often witty motion. But the loud sweeping music spoils the initial loneliness. How lonely can you be with a full orchestra at your back? And there is a limit to how much you can care about a machine. Or should be. Still, this movie for all its emphasis on tricks and images scores some surprisingly cool and resonant ideas along the way.WALL-E is a triumph of the work ethic, the little guy who matters. He's also symbolic of the utilitarian, no nonsense life. When all else fails, when there's nothing but junk, he's there, sorting it. He throws away a diamond ring, but keeps the box: it looks useful. The movie also celebrates the baraka, the blessedness, of much-used humble objects that through human contact grow soulful and real. In his junk lair, where he sleeps (dreaming of electric sheep?), he plays a little piece of an old musical on a videotape, people dancing and happy, a couple singing of love. This is the kernel of humanity that's saved.But WALL-E's a lonely guy, and when EVA comes, he's smitten. EVA is sent from 'Axiom' to see if photosynthesis has returned. She--we know it's a she--is everything WALL-E isn't. He's rusty and clunky and articulated. She's round and smooth and white and her parts float in the air. He is indestructible, or nearly so, but she is higher tech, and emits sudden, alarming explosions, powerful and alien--yet somehow feminine. These are lessons in sexual differentiation for kiddies.For adults are the bloated helpless future humans we see when EVA is returned to space and WALL-E sneaks aboard and follows her. The finale is simple and schematic--it's a letdown, despite the fun, comic reference to 2001, and the way Aliens is evoked by using Sigourney Weaver's voice for the malevolent controlling computer of 'Axiom.' Are we the prisoners of our own device? Even when it disappoints, WALL-E is thought-provoking. The little robots are real charmers, and there have been many ingenious delights along the way.",9,2,4,1 July 2008
The Good Shepherd," The spook who stayed in the cold: an epic critique of the American espionage game
","A gray winter day was a fitting time to see one of the first public screenings of a film called 'The Good Shepherd,' whose chilly hero Edward Wilson (Matt Damon, in a role modeled in part on CIA founder, James Jesus Angleton) is not so much all things to all men as nobody to anybody. A composite figure in a portrait of the birth, rise, and moral shriveling of the American CIA, Matt Damon's disturbingly shut-down Wilson would be one of recent film's most tragic figures if he were not such a hollow, unappealing man. Directing a long-contemplated project using a screenplay by Eric Roth (who penned 'Munich'), Robert De Niro has forged a 'Godfather' of Yankee spy-craft, a heavy, solemn epic about betrayal and loyalty in the world of espionage and counter-espionage dominated not by Italians as in the original 'Godfather,' though Coppola produced, De Niro directed, and Joe Pesci has one of the liveliest on screen moments, but by uptight, stony, patrician WASPs.Indeed as seen here the world of American intelligence is a privileged and exclusive and deeply conflicted one where Irish, blacks, and Italians need not apply; fathers are absent; privilege grows out of Skull and Bones at Yale, wives are betrayed; sons labor desperately to measure up, and the leading practitioners are ridden with guilt and suspicion. There is no one to trust and nothing to believe in  not family or tradition, or even music  only America, which Edward Wilson says belongs to his class. All others are just visiting.Into this demoralizing story, damning in its picture of the world of white privilege and of intelligence itself but nonetheless intricately involving and at times genuinely disturbing, are woven some of the major incidents and personalities of the period from from before the Second World War  after which OSS morphed into CIA till after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion under JFK, from hot war to cold war. You have Philbys and fake Russian turncoats, CIA execs siphoning off money to Switzerland in guise of chocolate boxes, and through it all you have a Cuba mole investigation that smashes Wilson's own family.Wilson's true penchant was for a deaf girl named Laura (an excellent Tammy Blanchard); and with her is the only time Damon seems to develop human warmth. He is forced to marry the more elevated Margaret Russell (an uncomfortable Angelina Jolie) sister of one of his Skull and Bones colleagues who remains Wilson's Old Boy link to privilege ever after. Traumatic embarrassment, revelation of closest held secrets, and doubt of loyalty are seen as inborn elements of the espionage world. The very qualities that make a good spy, as seen here, also make a man untrustworthy.Do spies ever have fun? Not much, as seen from the angle of Damon's character. Dr. Fredericks (Michael Gambon), a randy gay pseudo-intellectual who turns and turns again, is naughty, but he pays for it. Another Brit, Arch Cummings, played gamely by Billy Crudup, similarly wears a smile that turns to dust. A good professional of the lower ranks like Staff Sergeant Brocco (John Turturro), Wilson's OSS assistant in England, is a stern sadist whose use of LSD for an interrogation backfires fatally. Nasty sabotages are devised to spoil the left's Latin American agricultural schemes. Big foul-ups like the Bay of Pigs invasion lead to vicious internal purges. And through it all Wilson's son cringes and his wife pines; the marriage had dried up after his six-year absence during WWII; and his imploded selfhood is symbolized by his only hobby, building ships inside bottles. As the film bluntly puts it, the spy-master must choose either family or country; he can't have both. And is it all worth it? The Russian on LSD declares his country's armed might a myth perpetuated by America to justify its ongoing pursuit of world dominance. Is intelligence a needed quantity, or are its organizations self-perpetuating shams? The movie never gives a positive answer. This may be the cruelest picture of the spy game ever put on film.Many fine actors play small unappealing roles as spy-masters or cold operatives. These include De Niro himself, Alec Baldwin, and William Hurt, all creditable, but unlikely to get Oscar nods for their tightly held back performances. Damon can be accused of the same limitation, though if his Wilson bothers you, he's done his job better than you may think. And young Eddie Redmayne, as Wilson's grown son, has one of the most gut-wrenching roles in a story notable for its devastating picture of the effects of career on family life.Despite its epic scale and length (it's 160 minutes long), 'The Good Shepherd' is more troubling than flashy, more thought-provoking than moving. Ultimately it may be somewhat an artistic failure. The criticism that it is either too long or too short, that it needed to be pared down or expanded to a mini-series, has some merit. But nonetheless as a work that considers big issues and asks big questions, it's one of the more serious and intellectually stimulating mainstream American films of the year.",9,337,440,22 December 2006
The Blind Side," You can't win
","'The Blind Side' is a feel-good movie about a rich white Nashville, Tennessee family (the husband is a former athletic star and restaurant magnate, the wife an interior decorator with posh city contacts) that rescues a poor orphaned black boy and nurtures him into becoming a great football player. Based on a book by Michael Lewis, the story is substantially true: Michael Oher is a real person who had a crack addict mom and no dad, went through a series of foster homes, had a miserable young life and lousy school record. When the Twohy family took him up, he had gotten into a fancy school by a fluke when the coach saw his athletic potential and got him admitted. It's not just because of his athletic potential, the coach (Ray McKinnon) argued, in the scene of the movie, but just the good thing to do. 'The Blind Side' talks a lot about the good thing to do. The family and a friendly teacher saw he wasn't dumb, and he gradually improved his initially terrible grades and academic performance so he could play. The real life Michael Oher lived more or less this experience, got good grades after being tutored, went to the University of Mississippi. The NCAA was indeed suspicious, as in the movie, of Michael's choice of Ole Miss, since both his adoptive parents and his tutor were graduates and huge supporters of its football team. That was forgiven and he had a stunning college athletic career paved with trophies and recently got a five-year, $13.8 million contract to play for the Baltimore Ravens.The movie is about the miraculous blooming of a humble ghetto boy who learned to repress bad experiences and instead of being angry, is protective -- so he eventually becomes great at playing defense. As 'Big Mike' actor Quinton Aaron is so quiet and recessive even S.J. (Jae Head), the pint-sized, hyper-active 'brother' in his white adoptive family, runs circles around him as a personality. But the dominant figure is Sandra Bullock as the wife, Leigh Anne Tuohy. Bullock gives a suave performance: she's a walking cliché yet manages to be quite winning. Leigh Anne not only initiates the adoption when the family observes 'Big Mike' walking along the road from the school in the rain on a cold day with nothing but a shirt on. She even steps onto the football field later to coach the coach, telling him how to marshal the youth's formidable defensive skills.Critics are much less pleased by this film than Hancock's previous sports drama, 'The Rookie', another true story from a book, that one about a baseball player, who overcomes initial disappointment to become a pro. Dennis Quaid plays the athlete in 'The Rookie,' and the focus is on him and on the game.The idea of a saintly white woman who saves a po' black boy sticks in the craw of many, whether it's true or not. Melissa Anderson of the 'Village Voice,' who was added to the New York Film Festival jury that chose Lee Daniels' explosive and lurid 'Precious' last year, complained in her review that 'unlike the howling rage of Claireece Precious Jones, Michael. . .is mute, docile, and ever-grateful to the white folks who took him in. . .'Blind Side' the movie peddles the most insidious kind of racism, one in which whiteys are virtuous saviors, coming to the rescue of African-Americans who become superfluous in narratives that are supposed to be about them.' It's hard to deny that 'Precious' the movie certainly focuses in much more detail on Clareece's grim, abusive ghetto existence. It plunges us into that world and rubs our noses in it. Though deeply flawed, 'Precious' is vivid. 'The Blind Side' tells its story conventionally, taking few chances. But 'Precious' is deeply flawed. It's melodramatic and lurid and omits any glimpse of positive aspects of Harlem life. But it's more memorable than 'The Blind Side'.I'd like to know how the real Michael Oher feels about this movie -- and about his own story, for that matter. If his experiences turned him into a much celebrated pro footballer, how is their story 'the most insidious kind of racism'? If the Touhy family made his success possible with their support, love, and money, are they not indeed 'virtuous saviors'? What is the politically correct way of telling this story?The advantage of 'The Blind Side' over 'Precious' despite its risking charges of white condescension is that it provides a positive image of helping the disadvantaged in the face of peer disapproval. 'The Blind Side' is about racism: the Tuohys face it from rednecks on the football field and from Leigh Anne's well-heeled lady friends, who chide her for including a giant black youth in the family's Christmas card photo. Or course this is nothing like the danger Michael faces when he returns to his mamma's neighborhood. A prominent black movie critic, Armond White, hates 'Precious.' He calls it 'the con job of the year,' and says Daniels, Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey, the powerful black media magnates, 'come together at some intersection of race exploitation and opportunism.' 'Precious' is exploitive. The 'crime' of 'The Blind Side' is that it shows white people helping a black person. However, Leigh Anne tells her bitchy luncheon pals that she's not helping Michael, he's helping her. But that too will be be debunked: the white lady is doing good so she'll feel good. The Touhys had a wonderful time helping Michael Oher become an athletic star: shame on them! In this kind of subject, you just can't do the right thing.

The Queen," A tart, able tribute to two big Brits
","Stephen Frears' The Queen, written by Peter Morgan (co-author of The Last King of Scotland) and starring Helen Mirren, is a glittering, compelling, solemnly anxious news comedy about the week in late summer, 1997, when Tony Blair, fresh in office as new-Liberal Prime Minister, 'saved' the British royal family, or saved it from itself, when Lady Di died in Paris. Partly the Queen, Prince Philip, and Prince Charles, all in their own ways, loathed Diana for what she had done to them, which the public, conditioned by the mass media to adore her, could not know about. Partly the Queen wanted to shelter the boys, Diana's sons, from the noise of publicity, which would only aggravate their grief. Partly, and perhaps most of all, she was being the way she was raised, keeping things to herself, maintaining the immemorial English stiff upper lip. But also as Peter French has said about this film, the royal family 'are shown to be morally and socially blinkered.' Tony Blair reluctantly taught the Queen to see their absence of public response to the death, her insistence at first that it was a 'private, family matte,' was a disastrous policy that had to be reversed.Diana had skillfully manipulated the media to form an image of herself combining Demi Moore and Mother Teresa. And she was still associated with the royal family, and appeared as wronged by them. You don't turn your back on that. You eat humble pie and play catch-up. But a monarch isn't tutored in such strategies.No flag flew at half mast over Buckingham Palace, because that flagpole was used only for the royal flag, to show if anyone was home, and they were all at Balmoral, being private in their grief, avoiding publicity, and protecting the boys.The Queen as seen here and imagined with enthusiasm by Morgan is not as witty as Alan Bennett's Queen, in her last on screen recreation, in A Question of Attribution (directed by John Schlesinger, 1992), nor does the estimable Ms. Mirren (who's nonetheless very fine) have the buoyancy of Prunella Scales in Schlesinger's film. But she is witheringly cold toward Tony Blair, all foolish smiles on his first official visit to the Palace. (Blair's played by Michael Sheen, who's experienced at this game.) As Peter Bradshaw wrote in The Guardian, 'Mirren's Queen meets him with the unreadable smile of a chess grandmaster, facing a nervous tyro. She begins by reminding him that she has worked with 10 prime ministers, beginning with Winston Churchill, 'sitting where you are now'. As put-downs go, that's like pulling a lever and watching a chandelier fall on your opponent's head.' Fully recognizing the crucial importance of the British monarchy, this film is tartly reserved about both sides of the game. The royal family don't like 'call me Tony.' And Blair's wife Cherie is a bit ungainly in her blatantly anti-monarchy attitudes. But when Blair sees how Elizabeth's coldness and invisibility is angering the fans of Dady Di  the media queen, the 'People's Princess' -- alienating her own subjects en masse, he steps in and persuades them to leave Balmoral and look at the thousands of flowers for Di piled in front of the Palance with their humiliating notes; then deliver a 'tribute' to Di on TV. The formal grandeur of the film inherent in its subject matter  the Prime Minister and the royal family  is offset by its ironies and by the intimacy of the tennis match that develops in communications back and forth by telephone.This movie is ultimately kind to Blair and to the Queen. It makes us feel sorry for Elizabeth, whom Blair comes to defend (against some of his cockier associates, not to mention his wife) with ardor. In Peter Morgan's second imagined interview with Blair the Queen coolly observes that he confuses 'humility' with 'humiliation' (he hasn't seen the nasty notes on the bunches of flowers for Diana); and she sees his kindness as merely due to seeing that what has happened to her could happen to him as quickly. As for Blair, the Brits may have little use for him now, but the filmmakers acted out of the belief that this week when he averted disaster on behalf of the monarchy was his 'finest hour.' Frears has had a varied career, with high points second to few, concentrated in the decade of the Eighties after he came off doing a lot of television. These finest hours include My Beautiful Laundrette, Prick Up Your Ears, Dangerous Liaisons, and The Grifters. For a while there it looked like he could do anything, then more as if he would; but he's admirably willing to try new, as well as dirty, pretty, things, The Queen is dignified, but contemporary. It's bustling and grand. Loud music and vivid performances help. Mirren's Elizabeth is more of the Queen and less of the Queen than Prulella Scales' briefer performance. Bennett's Queen was very clever. Morgan's is sad and noble. The Queen, which is dignified, but contemporary, shows where the Brits are now, and the effect of Lady Di. QEII, like QEI and Victoria before her, has had an extraordinarily long and successful reign, half a century (obviously Mirren is younger than the actual Queen.) But with these events, with this crucial week, the days of her generation essentially ended.There's a symbolic fourteen-point stag at Balmoral the men are interested in. James Cromwell's brusque, lordly Prince Philip will do nothing but take the boys hunting, to get them outside. In the end a corporate banker kills the stag on a neighbor's property, and only Elizabeth sees it, when she's stranded in a jeep she's driven into the mud, and crying.For all its ceremony and noise, loneliness and wit, mostly The Queen simply tells a story, the new story of English royalty at the end of the twentieth century. It was a story worth telling, and it's told well.",9,159,248,29 September 2006
1408," Do not stay at a Midtown hotel
","Four years ago in 2003 John Cusack starred in a movie about a murder motel where one person after another kept getting killed. In retrospect that may have been more fun to watch than his new one, '1408,' a claustrophobic psychological thriller about a doomed and horrible hotel room in Manhattan where Cusack's character is trapped and tormented all alone. The 2003 movie was called 'Identity,' and its payoff was very far-fetched. But it had Rebecca De Mornay, Alfred Molina, Gary Busey's son Jake, Ray Liotta, and Amanda Peet. In room 1408 there is only John Cusack and his demons. And a lot of special effects. Samuel L. Jackson is downstairs in a hotel manager's monkey suit, out of reach.'1408' originated as a short story from the fevered imagination of Stephen King, whose plots often have a reflexive, boxes-within-boxes aspect. It concerns a writer who does books disproving that various locations are magical or haunted. One reviewer calls these 'paranormal guidebooks,' but the point is he's a rationalist. He thinks he can stay in any haunted rooms without fear because he doesn't believe in ghosts; then he can write about them glibly and entertainingly. Though his aim is to debunk, his books are good for the hostelries' or haunted sites' business and they do a good business for themselves, though he's just a skilled hack and his latest reading is attended by under half a dozen people. What we learn later is that he is haunted himself by the death of a young daughter, and he ran out on his bereaved wife some time back.Someone tips off Cusack's character, whose name is Mike Enslin, that he should not enter room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in midtown Manhattan. He decides that this is the perfect finale for his latest book, Ten Nights in Haunted Hotel Rooms. So room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel is where Enslin goes and where the action takes place. The hotel has turned down his request to stay in this room. He has used a lawyer and agent to force them to agree. When he arrives he is shunted to the office of the manager, Mr. Olin (Jackson), who repeats the history of the room to him and urges him not to enter it. No one has emerged alive from a night in it.'1408' has been compared to Kubrick's film of 'The Shining,' because both stories are about writers shut up somewhere so claustrophobic it drives them nuts. But with all due respect to the director Mikael Håfström, he's no Kubrick.In a story like this it's necessary to follow all the signals and suspend disbelief. But puzzles will remain. Supposing there were a hotel room like this where dozens of people had died of both natural and unnatural causes, chiefly suicide. Supposing all that were true. Why then would the hotel maintain the room in working order? If people have been dying horribly here since 1913, and an electrician as we see later refuses even to step into it, how come it has a working TV and clock radio, fully stocked bar, well made bed, up to date plumbing, and so forth? Why not just shut it down? Ostensibly, we're told, because hotels don't like to admit to bad luck just as they don't like to acknowledge having a thirteenth floor.Let us go back to the fact that this comes from a short story, and note that the original master of such tales was Edgar Allen Poe. In them, the protagonist has some horrific experience, and then discovers--what? That there was some reasonable explanation? That it was a dream? Or not? The irony is that Stephen King invents a writer who debunks the kind of story he banks his own reputation on, and then gives him a very,very hard time, as one would stick pins in a voodoo doll. But due to the loyalty of the society of scriveners, he lets Enslin off in the end. Or does he? If 1408 comes close to being a superior example of the old fashioned kind of scary movie--not the ramped-up youthful gore-fest that now proliferates but an evisceration-free bit of teasing mental torture--it's because Mr. Håfström is a decent director; but most of all it's because John Cusack is a fine actor, who is capable of making his emotions seem real to us. And though '1408' is very much less pleasant to watch than the haunted murder-fest of Cusack's 2003 'Identity,' it's also arguably a piece with more class---because it's a mind game, not just a scare-filled whodunit.The trouble with the making of '1408' was that even if $25 million isn't a big budget for Hollywood, it will buy you a lot of special effects if you're just working in a couple of rooms; and at some point the special effects grab the stage from Cusack: the hotel room is flooded or frozen over with snow or crumbling to pieces and covered with plaster dust. You're not inside Mike Enslin's head any more so much as you are simply on a film set the F/X people are having a ball with. It's a relief to be reminded that it's just a movie and you can get off the edge of your seat. But that's not what's supposed to happen, of course. You're supposed to stay on the edge till the end. Seeing John Cusack in this kind of movie makes me miss those great youth pictures of the Eighties in which he was a key participant. He's still a terrific actor, with greatly more well-developed chops. But he's in a losing battle with the plaster and fake snow, and that's a shame.",8,2,4,22 July 2007
Iron Man," The mechanical encrusted on the living, with a a vodka martini
","Is this story supposed to have political significance? In it Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), the brilliant playboy scion of a megabucks American weapons manufacturer (are there cut-rate ones?), discovers that his company's products, which he ostensibly thought used to protect the US and preserve 'peace,' are being supplied to some multinational bad guys in Afghanistan. To keep us guessing about who's being demonized this time, these blokes speak Egyptian Arabic, Dari, Pushtu, Hungarian, and after that I lost track. You wonder how they carry out their operations since they change languages every five minutes. Naturally their leader turns out to speak perfect English so he can spar verbally with Tony as the need arises.While Mr. Stark is held prisoner with a friendly foreign scientist, he's supposed to develop a super-rocket so the bad guys can take over the whole region if not the world, but miraculously he manages to conceal the fact that he's in fact not doing that at all but engineering a spectacular escape by cobbling together a giant robotic weapons-fitted iron suit out of scraps. That'll show them.Oh and by the way, Stark's chest got filled with shrapnel when the baddies captured him, so he's fitted first with a giant magnet to keep the lethal metal from going to his heart, and then some sort of artificial heart gadget. It's supposed to be a wonder but we're not to know how it works. All we know is that it gives out a luminous glow. It's the symbol that Tony himself, hitherto into life only for the pleasure it could give him, has acquired an ability to care. He rushes home, flying through the air being one of his suit's abilities, and after declaring his Stark Weapons Technologies out of the weapons business, begins devising a much more high tech and sleek version of the robotic suit thing, in red, and no longer made of iron but some sorts of miraculous alloys.There is a little of James Bond in Tony Stark. He likes to drink, he likes women, and frankly, up to now, he doesn't give a damn. On top of that he has wavy hair, a sharp mustache, a nice tan, and a fearsome intellect. His repartee is rapid fire and offhand and only occasionally mimics the delivery of Kevin Spacey. Remember Bond's blazing Astin Martin? This robotic suit thingy is some sort of grossly hypertrophied offshoot.There are two kinds of real fun in Iron Man for those who are patient enough to sit through all the wizard explosions and pointless political confusion. One is the dazzling special effects of Tony's private robot suit factory (he shares his process only with tool-manipulating robots that he handles with witty condescension). This stuff becomes most entertaining when Tony learns how to fly, with some nasty bumps along the way; but for gadget geeks the elegant complexity of the artificial limbs and head and the way they click miraculously onto Tony are equally pleasurable. The other fun thing is to see Bridges and Downey Jr. and Paltrow play off each other. Yes, real people can be fun in a movie too.It ought to be inexorably comic, since the concept of the robot suit donned by a man is such a literal expression of Bergson's definition of comedy--'the mechanical encrusted upon the living.' Only it isn't. Nor are obvious, perhaps much too obvious, implications about technology shielding man from his humanity, ever brought to light in this movie.Well, yet another comic book has been brought to multi-million-dollar screen life in Hollywood. Favreau has assembled an excellent cast and one stops wondering why they bother (for the money, yes?) when one sees how typically mercurial and witty Robert Downey Jr. is in the lead, how disconcertingly unpleasant Jeff Bridges becomes as Obadiah Stone, his would-be nemesis, and how appealing and present Gywneth Paltrow is in the neutral role of Tony Dare's (Downey's) girl Friday, Pepper Potts (cute name). Terrence Howard is wasted and too mild as some kind of air force commander who basically just works for the weapons company.You might wonder why Iron Man has done so well with adult film critics. Isn't this just adolescent fare given a mild gloss of adulthood and a heavy extra coat of S/X? But then you think of how much better this is than the competition, and you understand.",8,2,4,15 May 2008
La Vie En Rose," Rich biopic with editing style of a music video
","Despite an editing style that makes a hash of conventional chronology, 40-year-old Dahan's biopic of Edith Piaf is a film that astonishes. Beautiful cinematography and rich (though uneven) mise-en-scene contribute, with a solid supporting cast including Sophie Testud (as Piaf sidekick Momone), Pascal Greggory (as faithful manager Louis Barrier), Emmanuelle Seignier (as Titine, the prostitute who became her surrogate mother), and Gérard Depardieu (as the man who first recognized the magnitude of her talent)  and crowned with a spectacular lead performance by Marion Costillard that's both go-for-broke and precisely accurate right down to the fingernails.La Môme Piaf, the kid sparrow, born Édith Gassion and so re-named by Louis Leplée (Depardieu's character), emerges as in intense, suffering, passionate spirit, a believer in love and Saint Theresa (restorer of her eyesight) who exemplifies the image of the doomed artist. Things are turbulent from the start and never stop being that way. As we see the young Piaf, she's abandoned by her street-singer mother, raised in a brothel, almost goes blind, is ripped away from her surrogate mother to tour in a circus with her father and begins to sing when accompanying him as a street-performing contortionist. The crowd wants her to do something, so she sings the Marseillaise in a simple ringing voice and a star is born. But she's not out of the gutter till fashionable cabaret owner Leplée whisks her off the street and onto his stage to be discovered in turn by a composer and a radio impresario  and by then she's already a heavy drinker. Drugs and tragedy accompany the growing fame in this whirlwind tale that runs in circles.As the film shifts back and forth vertiginously between Piaf's last days (at only 47!) one sustained story is her love affair with French boxing champion Marcel Cerdan (a handsome and appealing Jean-Pierre Martins) that begins when both are in New York. This tender and sweet interlude in the maelstrom ends tragically when Cerdan dies in a plane crash heading back to New York see her. Piaf acts out her grief spectacularly before a full audience of friends, hangers-on, attendants, and handlers. Unlike the realistic sets of the early life, the New York ones are symbolic and stagy.We see a jumble of happy moments and sad, triumphs and disgrace. Some things are omitted  Piaf's actions during the Occupation; her marriage late in life to a very young Greek singer. After the plane crash took away her married boxing champion lover and she was in a car accident it's suggested she was never far from the morphine needle, but we're missing specifics of her drug addiction and its effects on her health. Apart Cerdan, there aren't many details of her loves and marriages. We flash-forward to one of many onstage collapses and a period of convalescence when the singer looks more like an old woman than a 40-year-old and moves like a stuffed mummy. That last triumphant performance at Paris' grand music hall the Olympia  one of her stamping grounds in her days of fame  is cancelled even by her, but then when a composer plays a new song for her, 'Je ne regrette rien,' she says it's her, she must rise to sing it and she's inspired to go ahead with the Olympia concert and the song what became her final anthem.Even though Dahan has said he doesn't hold to the idea that misery is a necessary ingredient of art, his version of the Piaf story is never far from that commonplace romantic association. Cotillard brings the singer powerfully to life, but one wishes the unremittingly tumultuous film granted Piaf a few peaceful everyday moments, a quiet sit-down for a coffee and a cigarette, a dinner without being drunk.Even though there are place names and dates flashed on screen to help us wade through the meandering chronology, the film gives no very clear sense of the shape of the life. How much did her existence change when she became an icon? Was there any sustained period when she was famous, healthy, and happy all at the same time? Did she really have affairs with Aznavour, Montand, Marlene, et al., as rumors say? 'The narrative had to be impressionist, not linear,' Dahan has commented. Certainly this isn't studied, analytical film-making but, as Dahan's remarks suggests, the wildly impressionistic kind. Dahan's last film was the nightmarish Crimson Rivers II; his background is adventurous but not altogether distinguished. He's done music videos, which may help explain the editing style. That editing is such a whirlwind  on her deathbed we go back to her childhood and moments or adult triumph with some remarkably cunning elisions between  that when the final Olympia performance of 'Je ne regrette rien' comes, we're wrung out. It is in the closing sequence leading up to this finale where the delirious editing style finally begins to make good sense, but such warped chronology doesn't sustain well over two hours and twenty minutes, and one wishes it had been used more sparingly early in the film so it would be more climactic at the end.La Vie en Rose/La Mome may leave one with lots of questions and a few doubts, but its emotional power is supported by good sound and image. Even in its cardboard New York sequences, the film is glowing and beautiful to look at. The singing is a seamless amalgam of enhanced Piaf recordings and the spot-on work of voice imitator Jil Aigrot, with exceptionally convincing lip-synchs done by the tireless and really remarkable Marion Cotillard. Whatever you may conclude about this overwhelming, chaotic film  it really doesn't want to give you time to think  you're going to grant that Cotillard delivers one of the most remarkable star performances ever in a singer-biopic. This will make you weep.",9,104,116,16 February 2007
Signs," Religious theme overwhelms sci-fi-thriller plot
","(Spoilers)In a way, `Signs' is an improvement over M. Night Shyamalan's two previous movies in that it drops their hokey spirituality and mysticism in favor of a simple quest for faith.  As part of getting down to basics, Shyamalan makes no great attempt to be original in his plot and style, and throughout the movie he borrows from a lot of directors and films including Spielberg, Hitchcock, `The Night of the Living Dead,' `Field of Dreams,' `The Birds,' and a host of others.  The debt to Hitchcock is signaled at the outset with the self-consciously Fifties-looking credits with accompanying `Psycho' knockoff music by James Newton Howard.  M. Night welds all these influences and sources together openly and shamelessly to create a kind of `American Gothic' of a sci-fi alien movie with an overriding religious agenda.
The main theme of seeking faith is seen in terms of a series of titanic events, survival of hand-to-hand conflict with malevolent aliens, as a result of which Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) rediscovers his commitment as an Episcopal minister.  For six months Hess has taken off the collar following his wife's terrible and seemingly meaningless death in a road accident.  The events of the movie convince Hess that his remaining family has been saved by a guiding hand, and that there were signs of what was to come.  This theme is powerfully developed (if too quickly concluded) and the acting of all the principals is strong.
Here we have everyman, living in everyhouse, with everybrother and everychild  two everychildren, actually, played with generic charm by Rory Culkin (as Morgan) and Abigail Breslin (as Bo).  Shyamalan brought out Bruce Willis' tender, sensitive side:  one could almost say he showed us a whole new Bruce Willis.  He does something similar with Mel Gibson as Graham Hess, this man full of doubt and anguish.  Gibson is a little grimmer and more humorless than one might wish, but what can you expect?  The man has lost his wife in a horrible accident, he's lost his faith, and he thinks he's about to lose his remaining family to nasty creatures from outer space that cut huge patterns in his cornfield and appear poised to take over the earth for their own devious purposes -- to `harvest' the human race, voices on TV and radio say.  This is a lot to handle, even for Mel Gibson.  He does a good job. Gibson is powerful and real.Joaquin Phoenix seems an inspired choice as Merrill, Graham's neer-do-well baseball hero younger brother who has come to live with him since his wife's death.  Phoenix, who can make a loser warm and sympathetic, brings a little ordinariness into the scene: Mel Gibson alone would be too iconic, and the kids too generic.  We have to be grateful for Phoenix's presence here, and indeed for that of Shyamalan himself acting in a thankless cameo as the culprit who caused Graham's wife's death.In the early scenes Shyamalan particularly strives for simplicity.  Actors are constantly photographed head-on.  This somehow makes the dialogue more effective, and it's often funny.  The director doesn't take himself so dreadfully seriously this time  at least not all the time. The picture of the two kids and Joaquin Phoenix sitting on a couch with conical foil hats is charmingly silly.  Shyamalan is having fun with the gimcracky tradition of Fifties sci-fi movies here. The veteran cinematographer Tak Fujimoto, who filmed `Badlands' and some of Jonathan Demme's best movies, provides consistently striking and beautifully lit images.Shyamalan's admirers will tell you that he can play the audience like a violin.  His detractors say he's manipulative.The trouble with the latter part of the movie is that manipulation does take over.  The nature of the global alien threat is too hastily sketched in and how it comes down to the Hess family isn't made sufficiently clear. Why do Graham and Merrill board up all the windows?  Who's told them that the aliens are headed for their house, or for Bucks County, Pennsylvania?  When it was all over I felt cheated, remembering all the chills and thrills `Night of the Living Dead' takes you through in the same kind of situation. Instead of all the creepy ghouls and the humans horribly turned into ghouls, all we get is a tall skinny guy in a wet suit squirting some gas in a boy's face.  The difference is that Romero's ghouls are an engine that moves on its own and multiplies and regenerates itself, while Shyamalan's aliens aren't clearly established as anything.In his concentration on what happens to the lapsed priest and his little family in the iconic Pennsylvania farm house, Shyamalan fails to establish a sense of true menace from outside.  The menace also ends all too easily. `They were turned back.'  `They went away.'  What about the boy Morgan's information from a book that they'll come back, madder than ever? Shyamalan doesn't care, because his true agenda is to depict a restoration of faith. He's juggling too many different colored balls in the air, and some of them get dropped.The 32-year-old Indian-American filmmaker is a wunderkind in a class with the likes of Paul Thomas Anderson, Christopher Nolan, Wes Anderson, et al., and more ambitious than any of the others.  He has authority and chutzpah as a director, he can put together powerful and engrossing movies, and he's clearly wonderful with actors. What he may lack is either taste or a clear-cut sense of how to forge a style that entirely fits with his preoccupations. It may be time for him now to turn his talents in the direction of a straight drama.If he's really interested in the nature of religious faith, he might do better to look at everyday events and give up playing with poltergeists and spooks from outer space.  He needs to forge a style that more fully suits his own sensibility and stop borrowing so heavily from pop masters like Hitchcock and Spielberg.",Null,0,1,10 August 2002
Beowulf," Livening up the Anglo-Saxons
","Sturla Gunnarsson's film version of this Anglo-Saxon poem and legend a couple of years ago robbed the story of its legendary elements. Since Beowulf is a national myth freely blending the magical, fantastic, and historical, nothing very memorable, or even appropriate, came out Gunnarsson's well meaning effort to make it brooding, 'historical,' and 'realistic'--except that he did capture the overwhelming gloom of much Anglo-Saxon poetry.Robert Zemeckis has done a new version, vivid and full of life, gore, and occasional humor. To achieve this effect he has used motion capture technology, with improvements over the previous feature to use the effect, Polar Express. He's also enlisted some rather famous actors, and the movie's been shown in regular format, a 3-D projection with the old glasses bit, and I-Max.All of which turn the tale into something fabulous, perhaps a bit kitsch, pretty entertaining, and the most ridiculous PG-13 movie ever. It's extraordinarily violent; but then, so are many traditional children's stories, myths--and national epics (the Iliad and the Odyssey aren't sweet little nursery tales; but that's the point: nursery tales aren't sweet).In the 3-D version I saw, as in the old days of 3-D, which never did catch on, spears and drops of blood and pebbles spew constantly in your face. We'd be dead or maimed if our mugs were thrust so close to such events. But after a while you get used to it. You adjust to the motion capture imagery too. It makes sense for legendary characters to have an artificial gloss. The point is there's no naturalistic way to render the Beowulf story.This movie has done well at the US box office. Some have compared it to a computer game, and it's certainly comic book or graphic novel material in the Zemeckis version. But the result is surprisingly effective, and despite some jarring elements--most people may just remember a naked Angelina Jolie with an odd accent, and maybe Crispin Glover covered in gore and spore and magnified to fifteen times a man's size, as Grendel, the monster.A highly computer-enhanced Ray Winstone (provided with a super-nautilus body) plays Beowulf, the Geat who comes to slay Grendel for Hrothgar, leader of the Danes. The story opens with the great 'mead hall' where the early Scandinavians got drunk and swore oaths they later were held to. Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is a drunken, fat old man with a young wife Wealhtheow (Robin Wright Penn); he's nonetheless extraordinarily brave. When the monster Grendel, a misshapen, outcast creature, comes to kill many of Hrothgar's men in the hall, Hrothgar stands up to him boldly--and survives. But the next day he closes the hall and goes into a period of grieving.When Beowulf comes along offering to slay Grendel and boasting of his prowess, he is challenged, primarily by Unferth (John Malkovitch)--an interesting character, unappealing, cowardly, but a useful foil for Beowulf whom the hero ultimately forgives and in the film version turns friendly. Unferth accuses Beowulf of exaggerating his prowess in a swimming contest. In the movie, Beowulf is a liar several important times. This is not exactly the way the story originally went, but writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary have embellished the original in interesting ways.The most obvious one is Angelina. 'Grendel's dam' (an animal term for mother) as the poem calls her is never clearly described--certainly not as a big-breasted, bee-sting-lipped naked babe. This is certainly a lively element, but a pretty distracting one. Beowulf has to battle Grendel, then his mother, and then, later, a great dragon. Arguably the dragon is even more distracting, since it's a huge, spectacular, golden creature. But this makes for an appropriately grandiose climax.Grendel is pretty weird looking, a little too grotesque and disgusting and not monstrous on a heroic scale as the epic poem implies, but naturally Crispin Glover does good things with the character, making him a pitiful as well as scary figure.Scholars argue endlessly about the meaning of various elements in the story; a big issue is how strong the Christian element in it is. As someone who studied the original pretty closely at one time myself, I was impressed at how well this movie brings the story to life. It doesn't seem to have appealed much to the critics. But the ancient bard who spun out the original poem was not an art-house filmmaker. Yes, it's kitsch; yes, Angelina's a jarring element; and yes, the various accents are a dreadful mixture. But anything that leads people back to the oldest English literary tradition of all and gives it popular appeal again seems pretty worthwhile to me.",8,1,2,18 December 2007
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Wonderful work by the team coordinated by Anderson, but Anderson is best with live action
","Anybody can tell you that an animated film written by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach and directed by Mr. Anderson will be more about family rivalries and quirky characters than about cute animals, despite Fantastic Mr. Fox's basis in a famous Roald Dahl children's tale that's been called 'great for reading aloud to three- to seven-year-olds.' Dahl was a Brit, and much of this production is English. But it's a hybrid of Yank and UK elements, with the animals, headed by George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as his wife, with Anderson regulars like Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Angelika Huston, and Adrien Brody, are a star-studded and somewhat cultish American voice crew. The animals outwit three despicable farmers and steal their livestock for food. These agricultural baddies, described by Dahl as 'Boggis and Bunce and Bean/One fat, one short, one lean./These horrible crooks/So different in looks/Were nonetheless equally mean,' are not only humans, but in the film contrast in all being played by Brits. Mr. Fox premiered as the gala opening night film at the London Film Festival, with Mr. Clooney on hand to add glamor. Media reaction was positive, though privately some English viewers were less pleased with the 'Americaniation' of the material.The stop-motion animation using stuffed dolls -- especially with Anderson's reliance on extreme closeups -- may result in the foxes and other critters appearing seedy at times, but the process is executed so slickly and photographed so brightly (with heavy emphasis on orangey earth colors) that the contrast with more hi tech pixilations and computerizations may not be so great to the untutored eye as some think. More serous for the kid audience is, well, how serious the material is, as well as more complicated, in this enlarged version of the Roald Dahl story. Take the quote offered by IMDb:Mr. Fox: (sighs) Who am I, Kylie? Kylie: Who how? What now? Mr. Fox: Why a fox? Why not a horse, or a beetle, or a bald eagle? I'm saying this more as, like, existentialism, you know? Who am I? And how can a fox ever be happy without, you'll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth? Kylie: I don't know what you're talking about, but it sounds illegal.Not very funny, and right over the heads of the seven-year-olds; but still, pretty cool stuff for an animated children's tale. Fox (one wants to say Clooney, so ably does he insinuate himself into the role) is often referring to the fact that they are finally just 'wild animals.' And the film is most captivating when the various creatures eat -- explosively devouring a pile of food and leaving crushed fragments -- or burrow into the ground -- again with explosive, instinctive animality. One wishes these hints of the savage creature inside the talking animated model came more often, and more surprisingly. These are places where 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' feels truly original.It might have been nice if the film hadn't gotten so elaborately caught up in the grand war campaign between Fox and his friends (no, there's no Fassbinder in here) and the three agri-business meanies (that's what they almost become in the film) played by Robin Hurlstone (Boggis), Hugo Guinness (Bunce) and Michael Gambon (Beane). Though some British viewers have chafed at this, the intimate dysfunctionality (so typical of the maker of 'The Royal Tennenbaums,' 'The Life Aquatic' and 'The Darjeeling Limited') provides the best stuff, the moments when the dialog sparkles and charms and makes you think. The script is so subtle, even with stuffed animals, at nuancing the conflicts between Fox and his wife; at conveying their son Ash's (Schwartzman's) insecurities and his rivalries with the too-talented visiting cousin, Kristofersson (Eric Chase Anderson), that you may wish the film focused more on the intimate stuff. As with Anderson's other movies, it's character, not action, that matters. So you kind of wonder why there is so much action. Nonetheless there are action sequences that work very well, which is perhaps where the animators come in, the vast Visual Effects crew, and cinematographer Tristan Oliver -- who seem to have had a life of their own and partly had to fend for themselves in London, with Anderson directing things from a distance, via e-mail, from his Paris apartment. But if the direction was phoned-in, it seems to have worked pretty cussing well (an oddity of the script is its substituting the word 'cus' where a stronger swear word, including the F-one, is meant). 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is an animated feature that's both sophisticated and winning. Those (including a couple of name New York reviewers) who say this is Anderson's best movie yet, however, may just not like his other movies that much. Wes does wonderful work here with the voices of Clooney, Streep, Schwartzman, Wilson, and the rest, and he's shown he can coordinate a great animation team. But he does even better work as an auteur when he gets to put human bodies as well as voices on the screen. Still, this is the year's smartest and most winning animated feature.",9,3,9,18 November 2009
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," People think this better than the first film, but is it?
","Everyone is so eager to say the second Hunger Games movie ('Cathing Fire ') is even better than the first. Why do they say that? Anyway it's just assumed now viewers know the whole story, or at least saw Part One, so we plunge in this time, with less introduction to this ultra-popular young adults sci-fi tale by Susanne Collins. One may miss Part One's introductory material, its glimpses of the impoverished District 12, which Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the protagonists, come from, and the gloriously absurd foppishness of the Roman Empire-inspired ruling class who prance around when the games, designed apparently both to distract and terrify the oppressed majority, are held. In Part One, instead of following the Hunger Games rule of saving only one survivor of the dog-eat-dog competition, which is like an out-in- the-electronically-generated-force-field-infested-woods version of to-the-death Roman gladiatorial contests, two Tributes (contestants), Katniss and Peeta, get saved by cleverly posing as a romantic couple. Even maniacal dictators have a heart, or it just seems good public policy to celebrate love among the peons. (This new movie has much more hugging and kissing than killing, though it has a brutal whipping only 12 Years a Slave can outmatch, and of course killing does occur; it just doesn't seem to hurt quite as much as Part One's.) The 'Victor,' i.e., the Hunger Game annual winner -- the lowbrow mindset requires the word be explained -- normally gets to live an absolutely protected life from then on, his or her triumph saving him or her from future competitions. Let's not fail to note that 'him or her' is primarily 'her,' because this, like the 'Twilight' series, is by and for primarily young adult females, and so the story has a strong girl-empowerment angle, for which everybody agrees the steely, glowing Jennifer Lawrence is the ideal central emblem. But trouble is afoot. The year's ongoing public appearances of Katniss and Peeta in various Districts, when they stir things up by jettisoning their prepared spiels, show that a spirit of rebellion is afoot. President Snow (Donald Sutherland), who seems to have nothing much to do but drink tea and watch these displays, is very displeased at these hints of trouble afoot among the lower orders. After all he's basically a fascist dictator -- though, by the way, if you just watch the Triumph of the Will you'll see that real-life Nazis did all this grandiose spectacle stuff way better than the Lionsgate folks. Snow decides to break the rules and bring back last year's double Victors to the annual life-and-death competition again. When they're dead, Snow figures the revolutionary spirit will fade, thought this is a dubious notion, since the people are leading their own revolt, not Katniss and Peeta, however much they may serve as inspiring symbols. Anyway, off we go: Part Two is Part One with a new urgency, because the whole annual Hunger Games scheme of keeping the masses too terrified to revolt now seems to be failing. We have a new director for the film itself (a method used to freshen up the Twilight series too), Francis Lawrence instead of Gary Ross, not that that's part of the story line. We've got some new name actors. A puffy, uneasy-looking Philip Seymour Hoffman, not by any means at his best, is the master of the games (was there one before?). There's a new pair of 'mature' Tributes (to attract the adult audience? -- played by Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer) supposedly chosen for brain, not brawn. Wright hence wears nerdy glasses and Plummer, who might seem an odd choice, is proclaimed a 'genius' for a nutty chant that tips off the others to how the island they're competing on is set up. There's also an old lady called Mags, played by an 80-year-old actress (Lynn Cohen), who must be pretty athletic to hold onto Finnick (Sam Claflin) as he races through the woods with her clinging to his back. Woody Harrelson, who continues to be a welcome note, partly because his character Haymitch's over-the-top style hardly seems any stretch at all for him, hasn't done anything interesting in between Parts One and Two - - unless you think Seven Psychopaths and Now You See Me are great movies. But Jennifer Lawrence (no relation to the director, I trust) on the other hand returns with greatly increased luster, having become a regular with a David O. Russell at the top of his game, winning the Oscar for her turn in his Silver Linings Playbook and coming up in his promising but as yet unseen American Hustle. Other actors give us more of the same. Stanley Tucci (as the broadly parodic game show master of ceremonies Caesar Flickerman) deserves credit for being just as cannily manic and silly this time as last. But despite a lot of focus on Katniss' dazzling game intro wedding gown outfit -- she and Peeta were going to wed -- there doesn't seem to be as much spectacle this time, or as much dwelling on elaborate makeup and gear. There is also the weakness that this time to make Katniss more admirable she fires only in self defense, and one doesn't feel the danger or the terrifying sense of attrition as participants are eliminated. Been there, done that. Spectacular effects -- lightening, explosions, holograms, shifting earth, falling sky -- can't hide the fact that it's all familiar this time, and you can make Katniss and Peeta almost die, but we'd have to be pretty dumb to worry. It's not that 'Catching Fire' is better than Part One: it's just that more reviewers have drunk the Kool-Aid. That didn't happen to me; quite the reverse. Let's hope somehow the story will reengage me in the followup.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, 146 mins., opened in US theaters 22 Nov. 2013.",6,21,50,23 November 2013
Get Him to the Greek," Get him back to rehab?
","n this new movie from the Judd Apatow comedy factory, a Hollywood recording company flack called Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) has the job of getting wildly unreliable, substance-abusing English rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) from London to LA for a concert in three days. He succeeds, just barely. And so does this unruly movie succeed, just barely, in entertaining you -- if gross-out parties and sex and such are your thing.Here's how Apatow movies work. The personnel move around and ideas are spun off earlier movies. Stoller, once an assistant and collaborator on Apatow's TV series 'Undeclared,' directed the 2008 Forgetting Sarah Marshall, his first feature, using a screenplay by Jason Segal and starring Jason as a character spun off Segal's original daddy-of-them-all 'Freaks and Geeks' TV series' lovelorn kid persona, Nick Andopolis. Brand was woven into Forgetting Sarah Marshall as the Aldous Snow character. It was a minor role, but one of the highlights of the movie. So why not spin out Aldous Brand into a screenplay devoted to him as the main character? And that's what they did. The question is whether Brand, a stand-up comic, is endurable over the length of a whole movie. Get Him to the Greek, a disheveled road movie with echoes of Todd Philips' very successful 2009 The Hangover (whose praise and profits these folks were doubtless not unaware of), is just a series of skits with a lot of barfing and partying. It's got its funny moments, and Brand is still himself a pretty droll fellow, but the story is very repetitive. (Economics commentator Paul Krugman and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich are woven into this in cameos, but we doubt they'll have Apatow comedies spun out of their characters.)Apatow comedies involve a revolving list of co-conspirators who alternately act in, write, produce, or direct movies. Addous Snow, the outrageous, funny, sort of cool and sexy rock singer who keeps this movie going, is played by Russell Brand, a British comic who looks and dresses much like his character and, as detailed in his 2007 autobiography My Booky Wook: A Memoir of Sex, Drugs, and Stand-Up, once acted just like him too -- only, if anything, quite a lot worse. The difference is that Brand in real life has been clean and sober for years and regularly attends 12-Step meetings. Like Robert Downey Jr., he has lived the debauched addict life to the hilt (complete with nearly a dozen arrests) and so when he acts such a character, he's playing a version of himself. Brand's character, Aldous, went straight for a few years also, but then party-time began again, causing his longtime girlfriend Jackie Q (Rose Byrne), also a famous rocker, to cut off relations. Aaron's boss's idea is that a concert by Aldous commemorating a famous evening at the Greek Theater in LA ten years earlier when he was at his peak of popularity will revive both Aldous' fortunes and the company's.Jonah Hill is practically a comedy factory of his own by now. He was in the cornerstones of the Apatow movie empire, 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Superbad. He's just a straight man here, and to emphasize his straightness, he has a workaholic doctor-in-training girlfriend played by Mad Men's Elizabeth Moss. What's a nice girl like her doing in a gross-out comedy like this? The tone of Get Him to the Greek can be wildly uneven. As Aaron Green's record company boss Sergio Roma we have Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs, whose crisp delivery and absolute self-possession in his scenes seem to belong to a more verbal comedy with sharper timing. The British actors playing Aldous' mum and dad (Diana Stabb and Colm Meaney) come from a more realistic kind of comedy. There are mock-ups of rock videos by Aldous and Jackie Q, including Aldous' bomb, 'African Child,' a mockery of rock stars' self-appointed and utterly skin-deep save-the-world poses. Brilliantly realized and perhaps the best things in the film, these again belong to something else, something parodic and outrageously witty, something with an elaborate, gorgeous mise-en-scène. But the base line of the movie unfortunately is simply crudeness, as exemplified by the parties where girls take their boobs out and the sequence when Aldous forces Aaron to place a balloon of heroin up his rectum on the way through airport security, or the (ha ha ha, ho ho ho) scenes when the obliging flack has to smoke a lethal joint called a Jeffrey or chug vodka and quickly becomes falling-down, upchucking sick-drunk.Russell Brand still is funny; and he delivers his rock singing sequences with impressive panache and some singing talent (some of the songs, though, are just utterly crude and tasteless). This time, Jason Segal is given a partial writing credit just for the 'characters' and Stoller himself did the screenplay; I'm not sure how good a writer Stoller is. There's not much room for character development in Aaron and Aldous' 24-hour-party trip. Take a look at Forgetting Sarah Marshall again. Jason Segal's lovesick guy was a well-honed persona, a character it's easy to sympathize with who has some depth. Feeling sorry for that guy and feeling sorry for Aldous Snow are two different things. Drunken addict behavior is colorful and exciting, alright (like a train wreck), but it's not very funny to watch somebody ruining his life. There are some keen observations about the addict mindset here. In Drugstore Cowboy the main character says the drug addict has control over how he feels because he creates his moods with chemicals. Similarly Aldous says his life is simple because his only worry is where his next high is coming from. He also has a suicidal moment, and performs on stage while badly injured because doing so brings joy to his audience and to him. In this sense Get Him to the Greek has a nice ending. But it take too long to get there.",6,2,7,7 June 2010
300," Speedos, pustules, and buckets of blood. It's called a Graphic Novel. We used to call them Comic Books
","Initially Zack Snyder's 300, based like Rodriguez's violent, ugly, macho Sin City on a Frank Miller graphic novel, certainly has a distinctively derivative look. That is to say, it captures perhaps better than anyone before (despite so many movies made from comic books) the Frank Frazetta comic illustrator style. It's a kind of adolescent boy's dream world, austere, romantic, angular (like all comic book images (but doesn't that come from Forties Hollywood?), in dread of the ultimate teenage ugliness, acne (evidenced in gross skin eruptions) and full of perfect, acne-free super males dressed in Speedos and capes to show off their excessively defined abs and pecs. Miller's and Snyder's Spartans go into battle against the Persians at Thermopolae wearing almost nothing but their buffed-up muscles, which are the one thing the movie is ultimately about. This is a bit ironic, since they are very into using their round shields effectively. You'd think they'd consider some armor, but that would cut off our view of the abs and pecs. They wear helmets, but those are mainly an S/M style statement.The Persians, in stark contrast this season, are very wrapped up, sort of like desert Arabs, and their leaders are very into elaborate, peculiar, one-of-a-kind piercings (quite the rage among exotic movie bad guys these days). They also seem a perverse outgrowth of the Spartan's rejection of all abnormalities, which the Persian's use of legendary horned beasts and elephants and deformed human giants, are a contrasting embrace of. Notably, a grotesque hunchback on the Spartan side isn't allowed to fight and goes over to the Persians, where he's welcomed by the giant metro-sexual Persian leader Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), who wears not only piercings and chains but lipstick, fingernail polish, and painted-on eyebrows. But the Spartans too have a crew of elders they go to for advice, whose faces and bodies are covered with pustules. (They're a teenager's nightmare of old age.) The imagination here oscillates between idealized male (and very rarely female) perfection and disgust at everything and everyone else.The thinking behind this movie doesn't seem consistent. If the Persians are gay, how come it's the Spartans who go around in bulging Speedos? Whether you're gay or straight, you wouldn't really want to be on either side. And after a while despite or perhaps because of the highly stylized way the battle sequences are cranked out with slow-mo starts and stops and pauses for spurting blood, the color-drained images of the uniformly buff male bodies and Frazetta landscapes, which seem made of brush-strokes rather than dirt and stone, start to seen monotonous and repetitive. Surely any viewer who's seen Kurosawa's samurai battles, or more recently Clint Eastwood's realistic Iwo Jima footage, is likely to find this movie lacking in real action interest. It would be interesting to see an attempt to recreate the battle from history books instead of a picture book for adolescent grownups. As an antidote to this glorification of fake heroism, go and see Bruno Dumont's Flanders when it comes out in the US.",6,10,19,9 April 2007
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Fire and ice -- but not much really happening
","The extremely successful romantic franchise mostly if not entirely for teenage girls has reached a midpoint, with this the third in the series and two more to come. How is it doing? Well, the strategy is good, this time: some violent, if blurred, battle scenes; some out and out sensual attraction -- and physical contact -- between Bella and her two boyfriends, the delicate vampire and fiery werewolf. They come face to face with each other and with the object of their affections, still with no thought of becoming sexual, following the series pattern, with Bella exchanging some warm kisses with both boys, nothing more. The movie begins with Bella and Edward (Kirsten Stweart and Robert Pattinson) in a dim but flowery meadow, making out, while Bella reads Robert Frost's poem 'Fire and Ice,' whose proffered dual choice as to how the world will end reflects her oscillation between the chilly but sweet and pretty Edward Cullen, the vampire beau, and his rival, Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), a fiery werewolf, a hotblooded mammal.'Some say the world will end in fire,/Some say in ice./From what I've tasted of desire/I hold with those who favor fire./But if it had to perish twice,/I think I know enough of hate/To say that for destruction ice/Is also great/And would suffice.'(Bella's reading this is the one allusion to the fact that she actually has subjects to study in high school, including English.) Twilight: Eclipse does not rise to the disturbing apocalyptic level of Frost's poem, but it does hint at the radical dilemma Bella faces in choosing between the tow boys. Edward is her first love. But he offers no warmth. 'Face it, I'm much hotter than you,' Jacob gets to say to Edward up on a mountain, when Bella is freezing in a tent and needs a cuddle to avoid hypothermia.It may not really matter to devotes, but it's more obvious than ever that of the series principals, only Kiristen Steweart as Bella is much of an actor. Robert Pattinson as the romantic vampire seems only barely possessed of any kind of reality. As the Indian-werewolf clan boyfriend Taylor Lautner at least, as required, is lusty, angry, and alive and is speaking in his own accent, unlike the London-born Pattinson. Unfortunately Lautner has a whiny childish intonation unworthy of his torso, Bella, or being a semi-mythical creature. Bella has bargained to marry Edward if they can consummate their love, after high school graduation, and she can join him in eternal vampire-hood, a fate he has always wanted to spare her, for reasons he has yet to reveal. Old fashioned Edward gives Bella a ring which was his mother's. But graduation still seems far away. She is increasingly tempted by Jacob, or at least he insists she is. But that remains up in the air. It's all about titillation.In the background other stuff is necessary as temporary distraction from the fact that when this episode is over we're still pretty close to square one. Jacob and Edward and their respective clans team up to deal with an invasion of a sudden horde of vampire 'newborns' who descend from elsewhere, attracted by Bella, for some reason. We learn that in their first few months of vampire-hood is when vampires are at their most powerful. These freshly-mined and dangerously violent blood-suckers clash with the Cullens and the werewolves in their wild four-legged form for some rapid-fire action. It's all so pumped up with CGI and loud music none of it makes sense, but young people are used to this kind of trickery and don't know what they're missing: it's like a video game, but one that's not interactive.Apart from being better received critically than Twilight number two, number one one had a big advantage: the whole concept was new then, and the appearance of vampire siblings in a Pacific Northwest high school had a campy novelty about it. I liked the idea that the weather up there was so gray vampires would choose the region to live in, with the Cullens able to inhabit a woodsy modern villa with lots of windows. Edward wasn't even there for most of number two. Now he is back, and the rivalry between the two boy-men livens things up. Trouncing the rival outsider newborn vampires provides action that has little effect except for providing Edward and Jacob a chance to cooperate with each other. Bella talks to Edward, Bella talks to Jacob, and Jacob talks to Edward. All three have zeroed in on each other more than in number one and number two. But has anything changed? Nor really. All this may make more sense in the Stephenie Meyer novels -- but mus be pretty darn silly there too.None of these Twilight movies makes much sense without filtering them through a teenage girl's viewpoint, according to which, evidently, boys are very attractive but also scary. It feels as though the larger action that takes place is just a metaphor for stuff outside Bella's real understanding, a world of danger and confusion, when her involvement with these two boys, with their opposite-pole natures, is danger and confusion enough. David Spade is good at keeping the action flowing; not much can make up for the shortcomings in the acting category. Striking closeups happen throughout of the wolf clan, the vampires, and Bella. Visually the vampires win out: the images seem sickly and twilight-dim nearly all the time. Natural light and shadow, the essential stuff of real and traditional photography, are not to be found. Maybe the next installment will be in 3-D (the way things are going) and it will all look even more unreal.",6,14,30,30 June 2010
Pineapple Express," Not just another stoner movie; just another stoner movie
","You could say this is not just another stoner movie but lately none of them are. Gregg Araki's recent Smiley Face had a fresh indie angle with its keen observations from a girl stoner's point of view. The new Harold and Kumar went political and ever more limits-pushing-ly gross. Well, for Pineapple Express, the Apatow group has hired regional indie director David Gordon Green, raring to try new genres. They've taken stoner action not to Guantanamo but rival criminal gangs, high above local pot dealer and customer--the story's starting point--into mayhem and violence.But starting point is ending point and the violence seems incongruous. It's still not clear anything matters but dealer and customer. Pineapple is first and foremost a good-natured buddy picture, with those two the bud-buds. If the action reflects how a high might go terribly wrong, the guys seem to show good and bad, laid-back and uptight, responses to a cannabis high, both leading well away from material success, yet confirming friendship. To the two Freaks and Geeks alumni, Seth Rogen and James Franco (Rogen was a leading Geek and Franco was the number one Freak), is added the amiable Danny R. McBride, who started out as an actor in Green's All the Real Girls but transitioned to Apatow-world via the down-market school comedy, Drillbit Taylor. The proceedings are enriched by Green's knack for developing character in depth and lingering on good offbeat dialog. As always in the Apatow productions, best buddies are front and center, but after trying musical satire in Walk Hard last year, Apatow has directed things--paradoxically for stoners, who tend to sit around and then sit around some more--toward violent (if bumbling and offbeat) action.The climax is a shootout in a gang's ganja factory. Seeking revenge, a malevolent team of ninja-clad Asians battles it out with the boys and local drug lord Ted Jones's mob with automatic weapons. Prior to that, more homely weaponry has been adopted, including vacuum cleaners and coffee pots. The mêlée causes the torching of masses of primo bud plants--a moment that should bring tears to any cannabis fancier's eyes--and wipes out the set in a very pretty explosion. But the dénouement mellows out again with breakfast at a diner where the three main guys declare undying friendship.Freaks and Geeks, which was about high school misfits, died after a season; so did the Apatow first-year college TV series, Undeclared. At that time, asked how his series on the next stage of life might be entitled, Apatow suggested: 'Unemployed?' Dale Denton (Rogen) is a process-server--not much of a job. He has one foot in high school; his girlfriend is still a student. When he goes there and sees her male friends, they're incredibly handsome, muscular guys who're funny and he feels like a loser. He wears a shlubby suit, but changes into costumes to sneak up on the people he subpoenas. Dale is a pothead, and so he has a close relationship with his current dealer, Saul Silver (James Franco)--a classic X-ed-out-eyed, smiley-faced, hippie-clad, greasy charmer whose greetings are 'Peace out,' and 'One world,' and who is his own best customer.Nothing quite equals Rogen and Franco's ad-libbing conversation in their first on-screen meeting, before the troubles start, at Saul's ornately shabby apartment, whose 'security' consists of a buzzer and voice speaker such as flats all had in the Thirties. This is when Saul introduces Dale to the new strain of weed called Pineapple Express. The name refers to some kind of Hawaiian tropical storm that allegedly blends plant and dirt in some magical way producing super-bud. It's a new item on the menu, and Dale is the first to get it. So when he sees a gang wipe-out of what turns out to be an Asian rival at the house of Saul's distributor Ted Jones (TV vet Gary Cole) and flees leaving a Pineapple Express roach on the ground while trashing two cars with his rent-a-heap, he's drawn attention to himself and left a lethal calling card.Franco's blissed-out charm as Saul, an understated blend of goofy and sexy, is a triumph. His droll performance, never failing to serve the action and the other cast members, anchors events and is the best thing in the movie. He and Rogen play off each other nicely, and for five golden minutes or so in their first scene together, the action is blissful and spells out in miniature all that is wonderful and all that is useless about stoner buddy-hood. Not long after, in contrasting Dale's nervousness with Saul's laid-back-ness, Rogen begins to ramp things up more than necessary, and the whole stoner vibe gets submerged in insane panic.Don't ask me why after he sees the killing Dale has to rush back to Saul; stoner logic maybe. Buddy picture logic certainly. From then on they're on the lam together, with on-and-off meetings with Red (Danny R. McBride), Saul's middle man with whom the two fugitives, buddies now, develop a love-hate relationship that winds up ultimately in love.What's wrong with all this, obviously, is that gunfights aren't actually very funny, though the filmmakers soften the intensity by having Red appear invulnerable. He gets shot twice in the torso and some time later is still sitting up, bloody but unbowed, at the breakfast table. That helps convey a sense that stuff isn't too serious. But those flying ninjas, even if funny, are from a different picture. Ted Jones's conspiratorial bond with a crooked lady cop (Rosie Perez) is strange and unappetizing. But on the other hand, if anybody can handle all this, it may be David Gordon Green. Still, as stoner movies go, this is a mixed success. Only the buddy moments and Franco's wacked-out charisma make it worthwhile. But Saul is a keeper. Primo.",7,4,9,7 August 2008
Sin City," Nasty violence, with a 'cool' look
","Robert Rodriguez's 'Sin City' (for which he gives graphic novelist Mark Miller co-director credit) is a beautiful, stylish, and ingenious adaptation, but even for a filmed comic book it's violent to the point of being brain-dead. One thinks longingly of the pleasing teenage romantic darkness of that brooding revenge fantasy, 'The Crow,' both Alex Proyas' version and Tim Pope's sequel. There's revenge in both, but 'Sin City's' revenge is so heavily laced with confused morality that it gives no satisfaction. If you want ingenious ultra-violence, try Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange', where the violence is saved up and released so that it has a shocking elegance and a punch. If you want teenage adventure with the same look (at a time when such techniques seemed fresh and new) -- stylized black and white with touches of color -- try Coppola's 'Rumble Fish.' Despite its nice look and its heavy overproduction using all the latest technical tricks, Sin City pales in comparison with all these.In fact the only movies 'Sin City' stands up well against, ultimately, are Rodriguez's other ones. This is his most complex and probably his best effort: here, he has bolstered his usually thin content by slavishly following Miller's cartoon books and linking up three of them so we've got a little cluster of characters and stories, although whether the stories are really interwoven or just stuck together is sometimes hard to say. Little is discernably added to the stories by Rodriguez; at times he follows dialogue and image as if the books were his storyboards. The effect is of a waxworks rather than a new permutation.A comic book/graphic novel is one thing and a movie is another. This distinction seems to be more and more lost. But on the one hand, you can have an effect like the Superman, Batman, or Spiderman movies, where the cartoon images are fleshed out with (at best) good, live actors and special effects. On the other hand, you have a movie that becomes a comic strip, like Richard Linklater's marvelous, twittering, 'Waking Life.' Any imaginative animation may have this quality, though digital animation, with its glossy roundness, loses the pleasing flatness of real cartoons, which are hollow and two dimensional, and either made out of black lines or filled in with flat Ben Day dot color. ('Waking Life' has the quality of hand drawing in every frame, because Bob Sabiston designed all the images that way.) 'Sin City' exists in neither world but rather in some Neverland where the actors are made to seem unreal with prosthetics and costumes and CGI but the drawn quality also has been lost. Part of the 'fun' of the rather joyless horror fest that Sin City becomes when fleshed out as a movie, as opposed to the stylized and stylish black and white images of Miller's books, with their dry, artificial quality (in the books, there's plenty of white; in the movie, the prevailing color is a gloppy gray, characteristic of a very different kind of comic book drawing), is spotting the various well known actors. Typically, Bruce Willis (Hartigan) looks just like Bruce Willis (has he ever donned any disguise other than a small hairpiece?). Clive Owen as Dwight looks like Clive Owen too, only more handsome, and also sadly more ordinary without his English accent. It may take you a while to recognize Benicio del Toro in the very evil Jackie Boy, and he hardly has the lazy, teasing speech mannerisms of del Toro: but is that an improvement? Are these actors making comic book characters larger than life, or are they just disappearing into them? Unlike these is the Yellow Bastard, the final evil manifestation of the evil politician's depraved son (played by Nick Stahl, who always looks sallow and nasty), because he looks like the Golem--an animatron with a yellow head. Perhaps the only actor who really rises to the occasion is Mickey Rourke, who's no stranger to deep cover as an actor and whose pugilistically battered face has been completely made over.But what are all these people doing? I'd really rather not say, if you don't mind. Probably when I was twelve I would have loved this movie. One of my favorite things to watch in movies back then was torture, smashed thumbs, eyes gouged out, bodies broken on the rack: I loved all that, because it meant nothing to me; it wasn't real. Now I know that this kind of stuff really happens all the time, and I don't want to see it. But this is a movie for boys, because here, again, as for me at twelve, none of it means anything; none of it is real. There's some pain over a little girl who is threatened with nastiness, but for the rest whether a guy has a hammer in his back or a knife sticking out of his brow matters not at all.The girls are the best part, for sure. They're as tough and macho as the guys, and a lot better looking. But whether a whore in skimpy leather packing heat is an example of woman's liberation is not something worth debating. Cool? Yes, very cool, if you're fifteen, or forty-five going on twelve.As has been pointed out, Rodriguez's literal reconstitution of these graphic novels is hardly as original as the graphic novels themselves, despite the technical innovations, and those novels themselves had less originality than the film noir they grew out of. The images of 'Sin City' remain striking and often beautiful, but I think there are in fact certain key elements in Miller's drawings that Rodriguez has failed to capture. He has used too many closeups and not enough of those wonderful distant, sharply angular images so typical of comic book vision. Did those themselves grow out of the work of people like Greg Toland, Orson Welles' cameraman for 'Citizen Kane'? Probably.",Null,0,2,8 April 2005
Gangs of New York," Too much ungliness. And by the way, what's the point?
","Let's begin with the casting. It's not clear to me why some people seem to like Daniel Day-Lewis's performance in `Gangs of New York' so very much. (`He IS the film,' an enthusiastic viewer said to his companion as I walked out.) It's a caricature, if a sly one, and the New York accent is the same artificial drawl he did somewhere else.  The long speech he does draped in a flag brings yawns.  Day-Lewis has a reputation as a risk taker; but is Bill the Butcher a risk -- or merely a burden dutifully shouldered? Perhaps what he needs on his résumé are a few more roles as contemporary Englishmen. The ultimate stretch for some actors is to play who they actually are.
Bill the Butcher's youthful Irish enemy, Amsterdam Vallon, is permanently angry, hostile, waiting for revenge.  This isn't an ideal role for Leonardo Di Caprio, a young man full of joie de vivre who's excelled as wild and exuberant characters.  How can the explosive retarded boy of `Gilbert Grape,' the strutting bean pole of `Total Eclipse,' the romantic and defiant teenager of `Romeo' and `Titanic,' or the spoiled adventurer of `The Beach' seem right as this beefy young gangster, who, however arresting at times, is always dour and doomed?  Leo as a gangster might have worked.  Leo could be a charming outlaw - and he is soon to be one in Spielberg's `Catch Me If You Can.'  But it doesn't work here.  And the superfluous voiceover he speaks makes things worse.  Di Caprio's unimpressive voice has always been his Achilles heel.Cameron Diaz, on the other hand, does do very well indeed in what remains a conventional movie role:  Jenny Everdeane, the colorful wench full of feistiness but ultimately pushed aside when the heroes duke it out to the death.  It's not bad casting; it's bad writing.Beyond these three who stand in the foreground, most of the other characters fade quickly from memory.  The colorful personalities suggested by the gangs' wild names aren't brought to individualized life.  And since character is all this movie has, that's fatal.Scorsese seems to have no sense of structure in `Gangs of New York.'  The movie goes nowhere.  `The world turns,' Leo says, in the voiceover's most ironic line, `and sometimes we don't even notice it.' The world of `Gangs' turns, all right, and, going nowhere we'd be likely to notice, comes back to another violent cowboy movie showdown like the opening one - which was actually more arresting, if only because we were fresher then.  In the end, what has it all been for?  The revenge is blunted by the affection Bill and Amsterdam develop for each other.  Di Caprio's performance hasn't the depth to convey the complex conflicts he would feel in a final confrontation under these circumstances. There's no catharsis, and no understanding.
Somewhere the point of it all was lost.  Cinecittà, where `Gangs of New York' was shot, is pretty far from old New York. Working in an Italian film studio seems to have led Scorsese away from any New York into the world of spaghetti westerns. The director loves the city he grew up in. Can he convey that affection, or recreate his city's origins, by dramatizing a colorful but somewhat questionably accurate book about nineteenth century gangs? Is an Italian American a suitable champion of the Irish immigrants?
Though the surface details of dress and accoutrements may seem realistic (we know how well they were done in `Age of Innocence' for another much more urbane old New York), what good is superficial accuracy when the whole series of collective actions seems pointless, focused only on racism and the rejection of it -- and social and political events, and underlying economic motives, have been disregarded altogether or distorted beyond accuracy or point?  This movie bit off more than it could chew, and the result is a big mess.But what is most troubling about `Gangs' is its relentless gore.  When has one seen so much blood pouring down bodies and flowing in the streets, so many limbs lopped off, guts cut out, knives thrown; so much menace of maiming and dismemberment and torture?  The violence is mind boggling and sickening.  Ving Rhames' famous threat in `Pulp Fiction,' `I'm gonna get medieval on your ass,' seems positively effete by comparison.  This is a movie to be slogged through.  It's deadening and disheartening.There is one sequence - from another, pleasanter, better film - when Di Caprio finds he's been pick pocketed by Cameron Diaz and follows her on a streetcar and thence to a rich house where she enters costumed as a maid, steals things, comes out, and is confronted by him, threatening, close enough to kiss.  This one moment is worth the rest.`Gangs of New York' is numbing, but not unwatchable.  Martin Scorsese couldn't produce a film that wasn't worth getting through.  But this is a project that went on too long, and went wrong, and it shows.",Null,0,0,21 December 2002
Moon," A sci-fi film where it's the acting that counts
","Directed by David Bowie's 38-year-old son (formerly known as Zowie), with a screenplay by Nathan Parker, 'Moon' is a curious and thought-provoking sci-fi story about a man working for an energy company, mining Helium-3 on the far side of the moon, who discovers, just as his three-year contract is ending, that he may not be going home. Sam Rockwell gets to do a virtuoso turn as alternative versions of himself (his character's name is Sam too, Sam Bell). Events are set in a traditional space station with a capacious, softly lit layout featuring the obligatory human-voiced and omnipresent computer -- mobile, not so big, a sort of clunky R2D2 -- creepily accommodating and voiced by an almost-human Kevin Spacey. It's a robot, I guess, and its name is GERTY. There are nice lunar landscapes outside where Sam sometimes rides around in a puffed-up Hummer-style Land Rover to explore or look over the machinery extracting Helium-3. Instead of the now all-too-usual and increasingly irrelevant CGI, there's more the feel of a giant mock-up in everything we see, which provides a better kind of background for what is essentially a Kafkaesque head trip. The interior isn't all modernistic chill. There's also a funky armchair reminiscent of the final sequence of '2001,' and cozy junk, even a college pennant, on the wall around Sam's bunk, sort of like a frat boy's quarters. Sam Rockwell's own appearance, his skin far from perfect and his expression a bit wacko, suggests an ordinary guy, just a worker, which is what he is, not some Astronaut.'Moon' explores the paranoia we feel about a possible future increasingly dominated by evil, pervasive corporations -- not Big Brother, but Big Corp. It also gets at something hauntingly explored in the movie Jones's dad Bowie played an alien in in way back when, Nicholas Roeg's 'The Man Who Fell to Earth': the terrible loneliness of being out in space away from one's own kind. Sam works on the moon all by himself, and some kind of radio blockage keeps him from being in direct electronic contact with people, including his wife. There's also another aspect of space travel where distances destroy human chronology: a distorted and confused sense of time troubles Sam when he tries to figure out what's been going on with his little family back on earth. It seems like it all happened a longer time ago than he knew. Or did it maybe happen to somebody else? Such questions may arise from time to time in other space movies, but the filmmakers are usually too preoccupied with stuff like conflicts among the crew, threats from hostile invaders, or technical meltdowns to go into the full awful anomie, mega-aloneness and paranoid delusion lengthy sojourns in space are likely to induce. 'Moon,' however, has no other crew members or invaders or technical problems. Everything seems to be operating according to plan; only it's beginning to seem Sam didn't know what the whole plan was, insofar as his future is concerned. When he's out checking on something not far from the module, the vehicle gets into some kind of accident, and when he wakes up, things start to go strangely wrong. This is where the full-on head trip begins, and we, and Sam, start trying to figure out what's going on. That's all I can tell you, because it's essential that the mystery unfold on its own.'Moon' doesn't dazzle but gives pleasure in its low-keyed conviction. It even made me think of Shane Carruth's 2004 virtually no-budget cult time-travel movie, 'Primer,' because even with relatively elaborate sets and effects, it still focuses on ideas, rather than razzle-dazzle -- on what Sam is going through, rather than what the filmmakers were up to.Hence the key work is done by Rockwell. Sam Bell is exhausted and lonely after three years alone on the moon with only GERTY for company, and Rockwell must go through a series of reawakenings and breakdowns after he hallucinates and has that accident in the vehicle and then becomes increasingly confused, angry, and frantic about what's going on. I'm not sure Jones or Parker make the most of the situation they set up, but Rockwell's quick reactions and mood shifts hold our attention very well. As we know from 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,' 'Joshua,' and 'Snow Angels,' Rockwell does great mental breakdowns. This time he does rapid physical deterioration equally well. In a sense, all the most important special effects come out of the actor's bag of tricks. But that's not to forget the satisfying simplicity of the lunar landscape design sculpted by cinematographer Gary Shaw and production designer Tony Noble, or to overlook Clint Mansell's evocative musical soundscape. And when Sam confronts other versions of himself, needless to say the CGI folks were needed to pull it off within single frames.Low keyed and a little slow, 'Moon' isn't for everyone and may seem tailored primarily for sci-fi buffs. But its disturbing exploration of identity goes back to a child's fundamental philosophical speculations: Why am I here? Who am I? How do I know I'm me?",9,35,52,22 June 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Horatio Alger in Mombai
","An exhilarating entertainment, an adrenalin rush, and a non-stop two-hour blast of colorful image and sound, Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a feel- good fairy tale but also a rough guide to the Dickensian low life/high life contrasts of modern Bombay/Mombai. In the story, by a fluke 18-year-old 'chai-wallah' Jamal (Dev Patel) has gotten onto India's version of 'I Want to Be a Millionaire.' He's been delivering chai around the offices of the TV station and they've discovered he's smart. He's been winning hugely as the contestant and has reached the 20 million rupee mark when, right as the movie begins, he's jerked out of the TV studio to be interrogated and tortured by the police because they think a ghetto kid would have to cheat to get those answers right.The interrogation becomes a frame-tale worthy of the 'Arabian Nights,' because each of Jamal's explanations of how he knew the answer to a particular 'Millionaire' question takes the form of a hyper-kinetic flashback to yet another exciting, heart-stopping moment of his tumultuous emotional roller-coaster slumdog life. Fast-paced, fluent editing integrates sequences of Jamal's TV show performance, the police interrogation, and his recollections to explain how he knew a particular answer. It's a juggling act that never falters, and the high-energy film-making ensures that all three settings are consistently exciting and suspenseful. Every childhood reminiscence is a shocker, a tearjerker, and a cliff-hanger as Jamal strives to survive poverty and exploitation and unite with his childhood beloved. We don't know how the interrogation's going to wind up. And most exciting of all, the whole country is waiting to see if Jamal, the poor boy making good, will win the big jackpot or sink back into poverty, and we don't know how that's going to end.Eschewing the machinery of the huge city's Bollywood studios (though utilizing several of its stars), Danny Boyle and his Hindi-language co-director Loveleen Tandan took lightweight digital cameras directly into Mombai's side streets and ghettos and worked with non-actors to portray the young life of Jamal.When accused by the police of cheating, Jamal sullenly replies that he simply 'knew the answers.' As we see the questions actually being posed during the show, Jamal is cool, rather dazed, in front of the boisterous TV audience, being played and teased by 'Millionaire' show host Prem (Anil Kapoor, one of several big Indian stars in the film), yet coming up with the right answer. Then the scene shifts to a flashback of an anti-Muslim mob that slaughters Jamal's mother. Jamal and his brother Salim must flee and live on the streets by hustling and stealing. They take on the pretty Latika as a partner, who becomes the love of Jamal's life. At one phase they're kidnapped by the evil, Fagin-like Maman (Ankur Vikal), who makes them think they're at a spa for poor kids and then puts out his little captives' eyes and trains them to be street singers (the blind ones make more money). Jamal and Salim escape by hopping a train but lose Latika. Later the boys steal shoes from tourists visiting the Taj Mahal and sell them in a street market, and they act as charming but uninformed guides while allowing their host's cars to be stripped by pals. Eventually Jamal is betrayed by Salim, who's always cheated him and turns into a criminal.'Slumdog Millionaire' is like an animated history of John Locke's theories of memory. Every recollection contains the answer to a question in the show as a fact engraved on Jamal's brain by the power of the accompanying joy or trauma he was experiencing when he learned it. In the later phases of Jamal's story, he tracks down Latika, finding her beauty being exploited in a low-life activity, and in seeking her, he runs back into Salim, whom he remains linked to, but cannot forgive. Eventually everything gets resolved appropriately and the ending is happy, with Jamal and the now gorgeous Latika (Freida Pinto) united in a kiss. The closing credits boldly flaunt the film's unreality as the principals and a host of extras do a light-hearted dance in the Mombai train station.'Slumdog Millionaire'' tells a story more notable for its ingenuity than its verisimilitude, but there's a tumultuous reality about it nonetheless. It can be admired--not to say loved--on many levels, and seems likely to stand as one of the year's best films. There are dozens of good actors. Superstar Irfan Khan (whom Americans have seen in 'The Namesake,' A Mighty Heart,' and 'The Darjeeling Limited') adds inestimable subtlety and warmth to the role of the police inspector. Anil Kapoor is vivid as the show host--and the film is highly successful at capturing the drama and suspense of 'Millionaire' shows. Dev Patel, actually English-born (only the young Jamal actors speak Hindi), was a star of last year's realistic British comedy series about Bristol teens 'Skins,' which from all reports is an absolute gem and ought to be seen. Tall and thin, Patel projects a perfect combination for the role of nerdiness and purity, innocence and will-to-succeed. Much credit goes to 'Full Monty' and 'Miss Pettigrew' screenwriter Simon Beaufoy who adapted Vikas Swarup's ingenious novel, 'Q&A.' This is a wonderfully cinematic effort whose essence is its intense visuals by DP Anthony Dod Mantle, coordinated effectively by editor Chris Dickens and underlined by the lively music of A.R. Rahman. Boyle has always gone for the wild stimulus package ('Shallow Grave,' 'Trainspotting') and the exotic adventure ('The Beach,' 'Sunshine'). He's also shown skill at working with children ('Millions') as he does in the many scenes of Jamal's early life here. This is his most intensely sui generis effort. It's one of his greatest successes and a disturbing, thrilling, heart-warming pleasure to watch.",9,0,3,18 November 2008
Donnie Darko," Flawed but original first-time film may be destined for cult status.
","Richard Kelly, a 26-year-old first-time director, has made an ambitious and offbeat, complex, but, alas, not wholly successful, movie about a 15-year-old at odds with his school, his world, and, as it turns out, reality itself.  His parents and sister, in a bit of a change for the coming of age genre, are friendly and helpful.  An ominous tall alien `friend' with silver head, grinning teeth like a skull, and rabbit ears, who pursues Donnie and calls himself Frank, is less helpful.   Donnie's sensitivity and brilliance remind one of Salinger's menagerie of precocious teenagers from Holden Caulfield to Seymour Glass, but they didn't engage in time travel or set fire to buildings. They didn't look as normal as Donnie, either, or have a fellow misfit as a girlfriend like Christian Slater in Heathers.  
Donnie Darko has too many agendas and tips its hat at too many genres.  It sure does deserve credit for keeping you guessing.  Donnie is led by Frank to walk by night and hear apocalyptic warnings.  At school he simply seems independent minded, outspoken, and bright.  Why is he doomed?  What's the big piece of a plane that crashes into the Dark house?  Why's it such a cheerful family and why does Donnie smile so much, and how's he so high functioning if he's on medication and sees a therapist who hypnotizes him and eventually diagnoses him as schizophrenic?  Kelly takes us on a wild ride.  The actor playing Donnie, Jake Gyllenhaal, is talented and has presence. His strange speech under hypnosis is brilliant.  He has a knowing, sly, inward quality and his smile has a nice scary edge.  Some of the school characters  the gym teacher who preaches a cheap psychobabble cult and the cultist quack leader she promotes to the students, played woodenly by Patrick Swayze, are overdrawn and shrill, but the family and therapist are reasonable, if not great.  Why does the movie, which is so strange, feel so conventional? There's no strong emotional focus for the boy's disarray as there is in Ordinary People.  The raw material is hackneyed  the ordinary middle-class white family, the nice private school.  They have some amusing, surprising lines toward the beginning, but then the wild spiral toward doomsday cuts off the smart social observation.  Drew Barrymore, done up to look like Julianne Moore, does a nice edgy turn as the risk-taking English teacher who gets fired for teaching a Graham Greene story that supposedly inspires kids to a major act of vandalism.  The other students, Donnie's pals, his girlfriend, and a pariah fat girl, aren't very well differentiated or amusing.  A plethora of special effects including digitalized ectoplasm evoke the teenage horror flick, which doesn't help set Donnie Dark apart from schlock. And that's really too bad, because the movie does have quite a few surprises and some originality. It seems destined for minor cult status. But it's like an American Beauty gone wildly wrong and not sure of the risks it takes:  at the end it takes them all back.",Null,0,0,17 August 2002
The Pursuit of Happyness," Running from poverty, with the smarts to make it
","First question: if Muccino has moved to Hollywood, who's going to be the mainstream film voice of Italian thirty- (or forty-) somethings now? This is the true Horatio Alger story set in the early Eighties of a black San Francisco salesman, Chris Gardner (Will Smith). It's focused on a narrow slice of time when Gardner's wife (Thandie Newton) leaves him with their five-year-old son Christopher (Jaden Smith) and he becomes homeless while in an unpaid, highly competitive program to become a broker at Dean, Witter that he's betting can turn his life around. He and his son are pushed from apartment to cheap motel to BART restroom to Glide Memorial Church daily beds till his smarts and drive make him the one intern out of twenty hired. End titles tell us the real Gardner later started his own investment company and just sold out his limited partnership in that company for 'millions.' When the story begins and throughout most of it Gardner struggles to sell a bunch of bone density scanners he's unwisely bought; they're expensive, irrelevant, and hard to sell to doctors' offices but he's got to sell them to keep afloat at all, even homeless. A running theme is how several of these machines are stolen from him under odd circumstances and he struggles to get them back. This is the part of the voice-over-narrated story he calls 'running.' Christopher goes to school in Chinatown. Another part of the ever-present San Francisco atmosphere is Gardner's success selling retirement plan investment to Pac Bell execs following his wangling a trip to a Candlestick park box to watch a ball game with a CEO, and frequent BART rides. One night father and son, who have used a station Men's as a 'cave' for the night, sleep on a moving BART train.Emphasis is on Chris's devotion to his son and the son's good humor ('You're a good papa'), Chris's willingness to go to any lengths to succeed and never let rejection get him down. It's a simple enough stuff. Only Muccino's sense of movement and Smith's charisma and positive vibe as an actor pull us through and keep this from being dreary or mediocre; it's got to have that zing but they get the zing. Using Smith's real son in the son role also obviously helps. There is chemistry, but the son isn't a professional cutie either.Also emphasized and a way this story is realistic is the importance of Chris's brains. He's good at numbers and always has been (as well as with people) and did well in school even though he missed college. He drills his son in basic information and gets a foot into the Dean, Witter program initially by solving the Rubik's Cube in front of a Dean, Witter boss who thinks it's impossible.Happiness is a misspelling in Chinatown Chris objects to, not some sort of hip-hop gesture. Quite the contrary: this is about making it in the mainstream world. Love it or leave it. If this is a sellout, so be it.This simple, upbeat movie hardly shows what Muccino or Will Smith can do. The Italian director's early films were original and mainstream in a good sense and have a wonderful momentum to them this hard-driven story doesn't really quite need his talents to convey, though he knows how to do it, of course. How does it feel to be famous in your own country and a freshman director in Hollywood? Another question, along with 'Why?' This movie is ably done but lacks the complexity of Muccino's mainstream, but stylistically original work Italian work (he created the mainstream for his generation).Similarly, this role shows Smith's usual charm and charisma but isn't the kind of rich role (Ali) or edgy one (Six Degrees of Separation) he's capable of and too rarely tackles. Sourpusses might see this as capitalist pap. Okay; but it doesn't lie to us any more than Smith's character does. And he is ruthlessly honest whenever he can be: he can't tell Dean, Witter he's homeless  that wouldn't look good  but he does come in for one interview in shirtsleeves and covered in paint drippings and admits he's just been released from jail waiting for a check to clear for an unpaid parking ticket. Chris Gardner lives on the edge. If any of this is true, it's an amazing story of determination.It's not often Hollywood acknowledges homelessness in US cities like this, or shows how a struggling person can slide down into it  and what a heroic effort it would take  a miracle, really, to get back out. Happiness has some tears, but it's relatively free of sentimentality. Gardner doesn't have time for that. He's too busy running to stay afloat and making dozens of cold calls, selling. This is a Willy Loman who's straight and successful; who isn't pathetic but awe-inspiring. When he gets hired, he doesn't jump for joy. He's just tired and stunned. 'Was this as easy as it looked?' an exec asks. 'No, sir, it wasn't,' he quietly says. There's truth in this too. Showing that some people are exceptional and beat the odds isn't a lie. It's called a role model. It's called an inspiration. This is a simple movie, but you have to be an ideologue with a somewhat mean spirit to object to it too strongly.",8,0,2,18 December 2006
The Bourne Supremacy," More good fun from this franchise with a new director
","Robert Ludlum's Bourne novels are a great basis for a movie franchise. Their hero has lost his memory. He has lost touch with the Who, the Why and the What of his life. Only the Hows of his training as an espionage enforcer remain with him as root instincts -- all the quicksilver alertness and killing and breaking-and-entering and language skills. This means you have a neutral action star. You can make up the plot as you go along. And since he's still in the process of finding out 'the Bourne identity,' character development is optional and flexible. And in Matt Damon the franchise has found a rugged young star with the quality of energy, physicality, and neediness such an emptied-out individual might have.In fact character development in 'Bourne Supremacy' is minimal and limited to recognizing faces and voices. Not a warm and fuzzy individual, our Jason. He'd as soon garrote you as kiss you, be you man or woman, and he may do both in the space of few minutes. In Bourne 1 (AKA 'The Bourne Identity,' directed for maximum fun by 'Swingers'' Doug Liman), Jason bonded with a woman he needed as a partner, Marie (Franka Potente), who was very nearly a match for him. But this time he's forced, early on, to let her drown in a chase, and though he attempts mouth-to-mouth underwater and sheds a brief tear or two later, he pushes her off into the deep without hesitation. End of relationship. There is no other, except for the telephonic one with his wouldbe nemesis, CIA officer Pamela Landy (Pat Nixon look-alike Joan Allen, not a romantic possibility).Bourne's idea of fair play in 'Supremacy' is to go out of his way to tell a young woman he's killed her parents so she knows one didn't kill the other as it was made to look.The plot is not minimal. It has its intricacies, but we need not go into them here, and to do so would spoil the suspense. The mystery of why Bourne has done the past killing in Berlin that he's now investigating, and why part of Langley is trying to kill him again and the other part is trying to bring him in to find out the secrets behind the 'Treadstone' assassination team and 'tie it off' is the motor behind the action.The film was directed by Paul Greenglass, who made the excellent 2002 pseudo-documentary 'Bloody Sunday,' about the quelled Irish uprising of 1972. His taste for vérité effects has led him to adopt a jumpy camera style with many zooms and closeups, which the editors augment with accelerated cutting. A warning for Bourne 2 users: prepare for nausea. Consider bringing Dramamine for the jumpy camera and jerky cutting. A lot of it really is a blur. If you are to enjoy the film, best to let it wash over you. Think of it as an art film. Imagine you're watching a video at MoCA or MoMA or Tate Modern. It's more a sound and light show than a traditional spy thriller. Greengrass's desire to achieve an original look and feel may have gotten away from him.Nonetheless it has many of the trappings. Like other recent efforts, you get scenes of mission control -- CIA HQ in Langley, Virginia, known affectionately as 'Langley.' Pamela Landy's effort to unearth Jason Bourne and figure out why he was 'killed' are no fun for CIA old timer Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), who has a secret he doesn't want let out. So there's intrigue on the 'good side.' In fact as in the novels of John Le Carré it's not at all clear what the 'good side' is.As in any good espionage thriller much of the fun of the Bourne movies is the locations, which range from a hot humid opening scene in Goa to a climax in the big bare snowy spaces of Moscow, with exotic travel spots like Morocco, Berlin, Amsterdam and Naples in between, not to mention Langley. And despite the lack of Bond-esquire seductions, there's the sexy former cohort of Jason, Nicky (Julia Stiles); and fleetingly, the cool Franka Potente.The charm of these movies is that you enter a room fully expecting a karate fight with broken glass, plastic handcuffs, and packets of neatly printed new fake movie-money American dollars flying about. Everybody has a minimum of five or ten alternate passports and identities near at hand. What a travel fantasy! With a 'go' from Langley, you're off across the globe not only with the trip all paid for but a new moniker and an exciting mission. And all this is so far from any conceivable reality, espionage or other, that despite the speed and violence, it becomes surprisingly relaxing and enjoyable to watch.The difficulty of the style Greenglass has heightened, in which the first fifteen minutes contain a mood of panic and everything is edited in two-second cuts, is that it's hard to amp up the excitement  which is what any thriller is about (if nothing else)  and what you get is really increasingly eye-boggling. There are different ways of outdoing yourself. You could become wittier and sexier. Or you could just become faster, which is pretty much what 'The Bourne Supremacy' opts for. The result is that the first quarter hour is just as good as the last, perhaps better, since it had all the potential, and much of the authentic non-digitalized physical action is wasted, because you can't really make it out till you get a DVD and run it frame-by-frame or in slo-mo. But still you've got fun on screen, and something a lot better than the average auctioneer with nothing better to offer than buxom babes, loud crashes, and Vin Diesel.

The Proposal," No laughs in Alaska
","The moment when pushy boss Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) suddenly forces her unsuspecting, docile, but ever-so-hunky young assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) to tell her superiors they're to be married so she won't be deported back to her native Canada, there's a certain awkward amusement. But it's more in the way Ryan Reynolds plays it than the situation, as written -- our unease, and the actor's. If there is such a thing as 'reality,' this ain't it. What's a Ken-doll type like Ryan Reynolds doing in a job like this? The answer is, waiting for this moment. Otherwise, if you had the sort of guy who might really be doing this sort of job, you wouldn't have a romantic comedy, and that's what the makers of the elaborately lame The Proposal are reaching for.It's not just that the assistant would probably be gay, or a young woman, as are Meryl Streep's in The Devil Wears Prada. Well, yes, it is, in a way. The author of the Prada book had worked for Anna Wintour. This ill-conceived book editor is feared by everyone on the floor just like the editor of Vogue. But although she seems ready to fire anyone she doesn't like, she does nothing but read unsolicited manuscripts while riding an exercise bike and coax well-known authors into doing Oprah. Her assistant, who presumably takes care of everything else, is an aspiring writer and editor, but he still looks like a guy who spends most of his time at the gym.The standard Forties material -- sparring guy-and-gal fall in love -- has to stand the test of 21st-century role-reversals, boss-lady, servile man. But the real problem is the serious lack of chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds. This is role for Katharine Hepburn, who could be imperious, overbearing, elegant, but very feminine. If only Ryan Reynolds were Cary Grant, but needless to say, he isn't. He's not suave, merely fresh and pleasant. The best you can say for him is that despite his bulky muscles he looks okay in a suit. The wardrobe department are the unsung heroes of this film. But it's not that Reynolds or Bullock does bad work, just that the writing sucks.The movie doesn't manage to establish Margaret's dominance or Andrew's competence before the plot gets its sendoff. Instead, off they go to Alaska to meet his family on a weekend when the Paxtons plan to celebrate the ninetieth birthday of Andrew's Grandma Annie (Betty White). Clearly, Andrew realizes he now has the upper hand. Margaret threatens to fire him if he doesn't cooperate, but she has more to lose. And so he sets out to make her experience in Alaska hell.But the new venue takes over and the comedy gets lost in the surprises Andrew's family offers. The Paxtons turn out to be by far the richest people in the remote town of Sitka (no, not Sitcom). This is the lazy way to handle the situation, so long as the filmmakers have the budget for it, which they do: poshness is so generic, so Hollywood. On hand are Craig T. Nelson from The Family Stone and Mary Mary Steenburgen from a couple more raucous but equally bad family comedies, 'Step Brothers' and 'Four Christmases.' And veteran Betty White, whose energy at 87 is admirable, but whose eccentric old lady role is annoying and cloying.Anne Fletcher lacks inventiveness and finesse in staging the standard situations. When Andrew has to jump into bed with Margaret in the morning when mom brings in breakfast (the Paxtons are rich, but they still do all the work in their mansion, except at party time), the sequence is drawn-out and unfunny. When the still-unfriendly couple accidentally fall on top of each other while naked, it's more clunky than cute: they're like big icky wet statues. It's better not even to talk about the omnipresent Ramone, played by Oscar Nuñez of 'The Office,' who apparently somebody thinks is funny enough to be a waiter, a general store manager, an erotic dancer, and the minister for a wedding ceremony. The erotic dancer part is excruciating. Only in Sitka, not, hopefully, in any other movie. Did the filmmakers bring in an actor from 'The Office' to make up for how poorly they developed the office scenes earlier in the movie? Oh yes, and there's other fun stuff like an eagle chasing a puppy and then flying off with Margaret's cell phone instead; Betty White chanting around a fire with a rug; Betty Steenbergen looking harried; and Craig T. Nelson driving biodegradable golf balls into the bay. When the two would-be lovebirds return to New York and tell the immigration officer they're in love for real now and willing to undergo his scrutiny, he says 'Let's do it!' Let's not.",5,51,85,20 June 2009
Cinderella Man," Exemplary mediocrity ain't such a bad thing
","I have considered myself an opponent of Ron Howard's approach to film-making ever since I saw 'A Beautiful Mind' and found it manipulative, fake, and driven by false romantic assumptions about genius and madness. Worse yet, there was the sheer skill and conviction, the demonstrated ability to make millions lap up what Howard dealt out and call it a great movie. Nonetheless I thought this might be a better one and it is -- at least in the sense of being a well made conventional boxing picture -- though I don't see quite why we need another one so soon after 'Million Dollar Baby: -- and in the sense of having engaged my attention and, occasionally, my emotions, without leaving me seething with rage. I may have to modify my anti-Howard position after this new movie.'Cinderella Man' was a phrase used by contemporary journalists to label the triumphal concluding phase of James Braddock's seven-year period of boxing failure, Depression hard times, and sudden rise to heavyweight champion. The conventional underdog success story Ron Howard has made of Braddock's rise-from-the-ashes saga is as well done a little epic of feel-good courage as anybody could make at this questionable time in American history. Not surprisingly, the cast had to be headed up by a New Zealander.The movie's steeped in period flavor which only rarely feels fake: there's a bit too much artificial snow and the period cars as usual are too shiny and perfect, but the clothes are good and the people look right. Russell Crowe himself has a face that fits very well into the sallow, downtrodden look of the Depression. I love the fleshy Irish boxing commissioner: I didn't know faces of such wonderfully glossy period smugness still existed on living actors' bodies: he's like a big, fleshier, venial FDR. Russell Crowe as Braddock and Paul Giamatti as his trainer (the character being an amalgam of the actual manager and trainer) are impeccable. Or not very peccable. Giamatti is odd, thinner-voiced and more delicate than you'd expect a denizen of the ring to be, but that in itself makes one inclined to think him more like the real thing than any usual movie version. And one just wants Giamatti, after his meteoric rise through playing losers in 'American Splendor' and 'Sideways,' to show us he can act a role that's neither whiney nor weird. Renée Zellweger, whom Hollywood too much loves to see as the plucky little lady, delivers the movie's most nauseatingly saccharine lines as Mrs. Braddock, but at least this isn't another of her embarrassing efforts to be elegant or busty. As the flashy villain Max Baer, who must be brought down, Craig Biro makes the transition from grinning playboy to scowling mauler with surprising, indeed incomprehensible, ease.In looks this is meant to evoke the black and white movie, in color. Its sweaty conflicts may have more in common with Scorsese's'Raging Bull' than Michael Mann's 'Ali.' But this movie isn't about a life, it's about a Depression hero, and the important scenes are of Braddock's family and work struggles, his pitiful decommissioning after a failed fight with a broken hand, entered only because of financial desperation; his struggle to find work on the docks and keep his family together with the gas and electricity cut off. Most of his history before is skipped over, and his life after is filled in only in concluding titles. What matters is the honesty, pride, and goodness of the man, teaching his boy you can't steal a sausage even when you're starving, returning all his public assistance money when he's been allowed to fight again and wins a big purse, never insulting a rival. It's also central that he took the championship from the brutal but glamorous Baer, in a moment that crystallizes his identity as Cinderella Man -- as the Depression poor's comeback kid, a boxer whose personal story gives hope to the masses. The scene when he walks out to the ring to be met by 35,000 silent, presumably adoring, fans is one of the most effective of Howard's usual numerous efforts to put a lump in the throat. A snappier moment is when Braddock's sent to dine in a posh hotel by the commissioner just prior to the fight with Baer, and Baer comes in in evening clothes with diamond-studded dames in tow. He insults Braddock and Mrs. B. throws a glass of water in his face. 'You have your wife doing your fighting for you now!' Baer quips. 'Isn't she somethin'?' he rejoins. The effort to contrast flashy style with modest integrity is quite effective.Rosenbaum in his thumbnail review calls Howard 'an exemplar of honorable mediocrity.' This is a favorable if somewhat brutal verdict: it means Howard's mediocrity comes out such skillful craft and sincere motives as to become exemplary, a sort of tarnished golden mean. This movie reminded me of 'Seabiscuit,' another conventional effort that works, and another symbolic Depression come-from-behind success story -- though the horse racing details of that one engaged me more, personally, than the boxing details of this one, and I got more tears and joy from the Triple Crown than I ever do from any rise to the heavyweight championship. Among recent fight pictures 'Ali' is more grand, its subject more complex and accomplished, Will Smith the astonishingly spirited and able recreator of the wonderful personality, the cadences of the voice, and even of the light-footed boxing technique. And fresher in memory, Clint Eastwood's prize-winner 'Million Dollar Baby' has more minimalist power: Eastwood doesn't need a Depression to show how down-at-the-heels the boxing life can be. But if you like the nitty-gritty black and white boxing movie style and don't mind having an 'exemplar of honorable mediocrity' reproducing it, 'Cinderella Man' is your stuff. Mediocrity never felt solider, stronger, or nicer. Only a small dose of Dramamine required. 7.5/10",Null,0,3,10 June 2005
Valkyrie," Language barrier
","Tom Cruise is fine in the role of Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg, the well-born military leader of the last, spectacular attempted coup against Hitler. That is, he has the right bearing, that of a man of full confidence, born to command. Cruise himself may originally come from humble origins, but in stardom he has grown into the shoes at least of Hollywood aristocracy. He's a leading man, and so, made to lead. But in one way, he's out of place. The trouble is, though he plays a German, what he needs, and lacks, is an English accent. That's because the rest of the cast, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nyhy, Tom Wilkinson, Tom Hollander, Eddie Izzard, and Terrence Stamp, to name a few, are English, and with their plummy voices they don't let you forget it. Of course, it's also hard to forget that Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, despite the eye patch and the crisp uniforms.Apart from the artificiality of the language, 'Valkyrie' rarely works up enough tension. And the fact that the assassination attempt is one that historically failed is no excuse, because 'Day of the Jackel' was about a failed attempt to kill De Gaulle, but it still kept its suspense coiled tight right up to the end. Anthony Lane has it right. The conspirators' scheme to use a Hitlerian emergency plan (called 'Valkyrie') and fake an SS coup, is too complicated to follow, and the all-English cast gives us too many quirky character actors and not enough solid meat: these guys 'are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers, but what we get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis.' Singer's direction is methodical, and the costumes and sets are nicely authentic, but the movie tries to do too much. It tries to set up a context of Von Stauffenberg's life and career, outline who all the main figures in the coup scheme are, depict the bomb/assassination attempt in specific detail, and describe the subsequent coup attempt, the Operation 'Valkyrie' ruse to unseat the SS. There's just not enough focus here. In a suspenseful, well structured movie about these events, the bomb attempt would probably have been the main focus, and Von Stauffenberg would have been more central. After all, it's Tom Cruise! And he's special: he's American! There are good moments. Von Stauffenberg's visit to a distracted, declining Hitler to get him to sign the revised 'Valkyrie' plan is impressively staged and atmospheric. It captures a tiny bit of the kind of endgame mood Sokurov got in his unsuccessful but haunting 'Molokh' and Oliver Hirschbiegel delineated in detail in 'Downfall'. And there's more authentic danger in it--the danger of being in the presence of a madman with absolute power--than in the bomb sequence. Despite Lane's calling Wilkinson 'the ever-perplexed,' he's pretty frightening as the intractable and mean General Friedrich Fromm. Bill Nihy, on the other hand, isn't appropriate as the indecisive General Friedrich Olbricht. He's too forceful an actor for such a role.Lane is finally right in suggesting how fundamentally silly this kind of enterprise is. And yet there's a whole string of late-2008 releases about Nazism and its aftermath whose Germans all talk English -- 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,' 'The Reader,' 'Valkyrie,' 'Defiance.' Only 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' works in the unrealistic language, because it unfolds as a fable about innocence at the heart of evil. In the other films, which make claims to historical realism, the inappropriateness is jarring and the methodology -- one would hope, at least -- out of date. Germans should have made these movies. And as for having Cruise speak the opening paragraph of the film in German, well, that is laughable, and only draws attention to the pretense.",7,5,9,11 January 2009
Up in the Air," Mixed messages
","Jason Reitman has again done something smart and skewered the zeitgeist. Clooney, who has two hits and a miss out right now (this, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and the misfired Men Who Stare at Goats), is at the top of his game, and his performance here shows everything he can do; his limitations fit those of his character.If this is a comedy, it's a depressing one. Even with a gloss of wit and perfect timing, Up in the Air delivers a pill that's hard to swallow. Its blend of cynicism and uplift is at best confusing. It's a puzzle picture.Ryan Bingham (Clooney) is a slickly shallow man whose job is delivering corporate layoffs (obviously an action of supreme relevance during the current Great Recession, but hardly a new thing). He flies round the country and his greatest goal in life, a rather abstract one, is to earn ten million miles of flying time. He works for the blandly amoral Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman), whose staff zips around the country telling employees they're being let go and must clear out their desks, so their bosses don't have to have blood on their hands. If you have to have your dog killed, you take it to the vet's; this is the same thing.While Ryan celebrates what he sees as an easy life full of enjoyable perks, this movie is full of pain. It richly details the reactions of devastated employees who have just learned they're fired, or tell the camera what it's like to be out of a job after 15 or 20 years with a house and a wife and kids. The terrible anguish of this experience is made clearer by the fact that actual fired persons have been used for many of these vignettes.Ryan knows he is doing damage, and his focus is on being cool and businesslike about it. This could be compared to the job of the euphemistically titled Casualty Notification Officers in Moverman's The Messenger, who tell families their next of kin have died in Iraq, except that instead of the grim determination of Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster, Clooney's character goes about his work with brio, and seems to find life out of a suitcase hip and chic.Ryan celebrates non-attachment (a value to Buddhists, but in their case not linked with cruelty). He even gives motivational lectures in which he advises success-seekers to get rid of unnecessary stuff in their lives, just as he pares down his necessities so he can travel anywhere with only a carry-on bag. In one version of the talk, he hypothetically fills a backpack with all the people in his life and then empties it out. He likes being up in the air; it's where he lives. He's even given up keeping a permanent apartment in Omaha, his company's headquarters.Ryan is a teacher whose pupil learns a wiser lesson and who has to wise up himself. He meets his equal, Alex Goran (Vera Formiga, in a nicely modulated performance), in a bar and they become lovers. She explains to him later he should think of her as 'you, with a vagina.' We don't learn what she does, but she perfectly appreciates the prestige of Ryan's plastic cards that open doors or get him right on a flight or into a good rental car. She talks about the unknown size of his mileage as if it was the size of his penis, and 'it must be huge.' An iconic moment: their face-off after their first roll in the hay, laptop to laptop, finding a date when they're both free and in near enough airports to stage another rendezvous.Danger of the same fate he's doling out comes to Ryan when Craig calls the entire staff back to Omaha for a meeting at which they learn they're going to be grounded. Craig has listened to a cold ambitious young women called Natalie (Ms. Kendrick), fresh out of business school, who's convinced him he can save tons of money by having his people do their hatchet jobs from headquarters via video hookup. Ryan is sent out with Natalie to test the new technology by firing people, first in the old way in person, then via video screen. He teaches her the elements of pro travel -- dumping unnecessary baggage, following Asians through security because they're organized and fast and wear slip-on shoes, and so on -- and then how to deal with angry, violent, or suicidal people they've just fired. That lesson she's not so ready for.The irony is that being fired by an outsider is downright warm and human compared to having it done by somebody on a computer screen. Meanwhile Natalie's boyfriend fires her from their relationship via text message. She took this job and came to Omaha to be with him when she could have had a better job in San Francisco. Things get complicated with Alex for Ryan, and when Natalie meets Alex she challenges Ryan's complete unwillingness to accept commitment.The movie gets preachy when Ryan and Alex attend his sister's wedding. Eventually the message is E.M. Forster's 'only connect,' and it's clear Ryan will become a very lonely guy if he doesn't reform. The sophistication of Alex and Ryan and their slick shared gamesmanship become hollow. They might be a couple out of the great age of Hollywood studio comedy -- except they aren't funny, and aren't meant to be. The trouble is, we only care about George Clooney when he's being a charmer or getting the better of someone and when his character is being shown up, he can seem shallow, tarnished. His gloss isn't invincible like Cary Grant's. What Reitman's doing here is complex and interesting, but the screenplay is weak in various areas. The focus wavers too much between being about job loss and corporate wising up, and the movie's too sophisticated to wind up so reliant on cornpone wisdom.",8,4,12,12 December 2009
Atonement," Expansion
","Atonement starts at a great English country house on a hot summer day before the Second World War. It speaks of the attraction between two young Cambridge graduates, Cecily Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Despite their shared educational background, Cecily is upper class (her family owns the great house) and Robbie is the son of one of the family's servants, and out of this disparity comes a remarkable and rather tragic story in the novel by Ian McEwan which Joe Wrightwho directed Ms. Knightley in Pride and Prejudiceworking this time from a screenplay by the skillful Christopher Hampton, has made into an impressive movie.The trouble with a movie that's a literary adaptation is that you may have read the book, especially when the book is as good as Atonement. Ian McEwan may not be a great writer but he's certainly a very good one. He writes delicious, intelligent sentences and with them tells surprising, quietly bold tales. The best film adaptation of a McEwan novel is Andrew Birkin's The Cement Garden. The Cement Garden, it's worth noting, is haunting and strange and touches on one of the most ancient of taboos, but as a story it's simple in its basic elements. Atonement is many-leveled and far grander and more emotionally fraught, encompassing as it does the decline of a ruling class and a great war and themes of sex and love and class and the danger of ignorance and the capacity of literature to redeem a lifeor not. Filming this novel is an ambitious task.McEwan's Atonement is a particularly dangerous novel to film because it's so easy to make the details overblown and lose the essence of the thing. This is what Joe Wright has done. He's still produced a beautiful, occasionally engaging and involving (but sometimes fatiguing) movie replete with moments of shock and sorrow and grandeur. But the book wasn't about wounded troops massed on the beach or an Underground tunnel being floodedthough these are among the more memorable images of the film. McEwan's Atonement really isn't about the grandeur of pre-War upper class English country life--whose details are just sketched in deftly by the novelist while he focuses on the emotions, the suspicions, the doubts, the passions. Nor, as one reads McEwan's novel, does one hear in one's mind the sound of large string orchestra playing with an incessant overlay of a loudly clacking typewriter. But in the film one never gets away from that. This is one of the reasons that novels about or from any period are timeless: the period trappings don't overwhelm, because we don't have to see them. As Henry Green wrote, 'Prose is not to be read aloud but to oneself alone at night, and it is not quick as poetry but rather a gathering web of insinuations ... Prose should be a long intimacy between strangers with no direct appeal to what both may have known. It should slowly appeal to feelings unexpressed, it should in the end draw tears out of the stone ...' Atonement, the novel, is about the mistake of a naïve, willful, dangerously over-imaginative girl that plays into the class prejudices of a great English family and ruins several lives. These are events that at various points you really cannot stage at all. They're things you have to tell aboutor rather, hint at, and make the audience think about. Where the book is delicateyet disturbingtears from the stonethe movie is more operatic, and not always opera of the highest order. It may be Merchant-Ivory or Masterpiece Theater, but it's not Brideshead Revisited. As Beresford-Howe said in Film Threat, 'Imagine if the team that made The English Patient tried to make the same kind of movie, with even more brave-lads-fighting-the-Jerries porn and this time with Extra Added English country manor porn, and without really good actors, and this movie is what you'd have.' This is the sad truth. One wants to like Knightley and McAvoy and they've been excellent in other roles, but they aren't quite up to their jobs this time, and neither are the two young women who play the younger sister Briony, Saoirse Roman as the eleven-year-old girl who makes the false accusations, and Romola Garai as the repentant eighteen-year-old. Briony is central. She needs to be infuriating, yet sympatheticwhich isn't so easy, and neither actress quite has those qualities. There is a great actress at the end in Vanessa Redgrave, with her immense authority and wisdom, as the aged, soon-to-die Briony, who appears in one speech to a TV interviewer about her latest, and last novel, which is called Atonement. But this is just last-minute exposition and since the message is one of failure and quiet despair, it's not the grand finale the elaborately staged scenes have led one to expect. Too much of the movie's time is thrown away on great paneled hallways and country house lawns, bright lipstick, period hairdos, silk blouses, little boys talking as little English boys no longer do, and haggard battle scenes that could as well be of the First World War as the Second.I don't side with those who think the vast scene of troops on the beach is a mere tour de force without emotion. Well, maybe it is, but it's still the most mesmerizing sequence in the movieperhaps it's involving because we don't know where it's going to go. And ultimately, pointless or not, the post-battle sequences are the closest thing we get to an objective correlative for the human tragedy the young girl has wrought. Other scenes, which can be evoked in a few lines in the novel, are so elaborately staged they overwhelm the ideas McEwan meant to evoke. We don't need to see that Underground flood. It's far more affecting just to learn what happened without seeing it. McEwan's novel isn't perfect, it's too manipulative, but it's a better story.",8,2,7,16 December 2007
