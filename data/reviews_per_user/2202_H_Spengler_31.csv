Angels & Demons," Changed from book, but overall not bad
","I was in the process of reading the book as this movie came out, and had not yet finished with the book...now that i'm done with the book, I can now I feel, write a proper review.There were things I liked about the book more than the movie and vice versa. The changing of Vittoria's character into more of a support scientist didn't truthfully bother me. I liked that her character in both movie and book as a smart female, but I understand the decision to nix the romantic plot, and her father being changed into 'research associate.' Her revenge driven romantic interest wasn't at all missed by me. Also, for the time constraints of the movie, it wouldn't have properly been laid out.I did however, prefer the 'hassassin' of the book to the surprisingly minor character he seemed to appear as in the movie. Somehow I couldn't be frightened or intimidated by the 'bookwormish' appearing 'hassassin' vs. unstoppable buff killing machine the book offered us.No complaints on Hank's front. He still remains one of my favorite actors, and seems to have more comfortably slipped into the shoes of Robert Langdon than seen in the DVC.Ewan McGregor was perfect in the role of the Camerlengo. He was exactly as I pictured the character in the book. The basic story is kept in tact and follows pretty faithfully to the book, a mystery, a forgotten path needing to be uncovered, murdered Cardinals, etc. I was wondering though, why the decision to save the final Cardinal? I'm on the fence about the helicopter escape from the book vs. the helicopter escape in the movie, but I kind of liked the idea about not suspecting a thing about McGregor until almost the last minute. I do however wonder why he chose self-immolation so rapidly after entering the Sistine Chapel, before even anyone could verbalize an accusation, it's as if in a nano-second he knew. Perhaps his own guilt overwhelming him? The cinematography is astounding, really beautifully done. And the use of statues, paintings, and other works of art is gorgeous. (Although yes, I know a lot were sets.) Clever book = clever movie, however changed it was. It was slow starting...but so was the book. I do however wonder why the decision to make this a sequel to DVC instead of a Prequel such as the book was. I was confused (as I still was reading the book when I saw this, and the book made no mention of any 'previous events from last year', as was referred to in the movie, as the reason for Langdon's rejection from access to the Vatican archives. Did they not think the audience could put 2 and 2 together to figure out that this series of events could possibly be beforehand.Of course the movie was seemingly endlessly debated in the row behind me where a bunch of American Eagle wearing tweens were having they're own running commentary throughout, but I learned to tune them out.Not a bad film. 7/10",7,3,4,25 May 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Cliché ridden, coma inducing snooze fest.
","Let's review this checklist of actors: Edward Norton, Tim Roth, William Hurt, and awesome cameos by Lou Ferrigno and Robert Downey Jr., not to mention Stan Lee's. So how is it when you have this sort of team you manage to make a movie that is boring, dull, and convoluted? And that's even during the action sequences.I don't blame the actors, they've well proved their abilities in other movies. (With the exception of Tyler, who's crowning cinematic achievement was in the LOTR trilogy, she was right where she should be...a minor character.) The performances are phoned in, and as the movie progresses, you can almost see the realization cross faces, as they realize how ridiculous, bland and half assed the lines they're reciting actually are. The story is overcomplicated and ridiculous.There's nothing intelligent about this movie, nothing suspenseful, or even remotely insightful. The CGI is terrible and overwhelming, and battles wage on way too long. Hulk vs. bad guys, Hulk vs. military, Hulk vs. Tank, Hulk vs. government created super creature. Of course Hulk wins...was there ever a doubt? Not when a sequel could yank in more cash. Norton looked about as enthusiastic as going to the restroom after eating some bad seafood, Roth tried his best with his overused clichéd character - evil, psychopath war vet part of gov't experimentation turning him into super evil, psychopath war vet, unstoppable creature hell bent on destroying Hulk and anyone else in the way. Hurt is out of place as a hippie looking general who's appearance alone violates several conditions of military protocol. Tyler's standard performance as love interest has been reheated so many times it's unrecognizable. There's not a convincing performance in the bunch! Thankfully Downey Jr. & Ferrino spare themselves as they're in the movie for about a minute each. It's the only thing that prevents me from giving this one star. The Hulk is without a doubt Marvel's most boring franchise. (Ghost Rider was a least amusing, and the CGI was appropriate.) Sorry guys, Ferrino's late 70's Hulk TV show is still boss in my book. 2/10",2,3,6,19 September 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worst of the series
","I remember buying my ticket to see this when it came out. As a lifelong rabid Wars fan, the blood raced through my veins to see this. Imagine that, a brand new Star Wars movie!! And I was still flying on the Euphoria on seeing the re-releases 2 years earlier! (in '77 I wasn't even around and but a small child when Empire & Jedi came out, so I had never seen them but on the small screen til the re-release.)You can imagine how far on the floor my jaw dropped at the sheer badness that was Episode 1. There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't even have the space to write it all down, and am not even sure where to start.1. Jar Jar Binks. Do I need to even say why? Easily the bamboo shoot under the finger nail of all movie characters ever.2. The force is microscopic blood organisms. Are you freakin' kidding me?! I grew up with the movies, and the wisdom & mysticism presented in them, not to learn it's on the same level as a cold! Thanks for trainwrecking one of the most beloved concepts in all of sci fi.3. Jake Lloyd/Anakin Skywalker. Miscast actor (more of a blonde, California surf kid, then the dark future Darth Vadar.) His immaculate conception?! What you mean like Jesus? He built C3PO?! (Welcome to plot convenience playhouse everyone!!) I can accept that he's smart, and has an uncanny ability to fix things. In face, it's easier for me to say that there's NOTHING about him that is appealing than to list all the faults. To the reviewers who said that this part would've been better played by Haley Joel Osment, I whole heartedly agree, Osment possesses a great brooding dark quality and is a much better actor. 4. It's Booooooring!! A bunch of political dribble, dull trade disputes, pod races that go on for what seems like years. 'Wattoo' talks too much I likened him more to a paroled hustler than some scuzzy repair shop guy. Really dumb & unnecessary underwater city and it's occupants. Ray Park is completely wasted and underutilized, waste of Neeson & Portman's talents. Only Ewan McGregor manages to pull off a decent performance given the undoubtedly crappy script and worse direction. It would seem George Lucas was so involved with making his movie look 'bright & shiny' with as many special effects as he could cram in, that he forgot about a decent story, good script and creating characters that we could care about. Nothing about any of these people made me want to care about them, their lives, their quests, the descent into Vadar.....nothing! (Except McGregor, who did a great job with what he had.) I was so vastly disappointed with this film that it put me off seeing Episode 2 (which was a significant improvement) for months. Being the Wars fan I am, i'm giving this the halfway rating of 5/10 (being VERY generous, and mostly for McGreogor's & Park's performances.) George Lucas owes John Williams an apology. The score is probably the best part of the movie, but for making a man of William's talent waste time on it, Lucas, you should be ashamed of yourself!",5,30,56,11 January 2009
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," An insulting slap in the face
","I didn't go to this movie expecting Oscar winning caliber, I did want to be entertained, even in a 'turn your brain off' way. I understand that more often than not when books are adapted into movies, things are changed, cut for time/story, etc. Preserving the main idea of a story can be done even implementing this method without the nuclear meltdown that occurred with this adaptation.I LOVED the book. I loved the way time was taken to carefully develop the characters & story, & weave them into coordination with true historical facts, & events.I'm not saying this needed to be 'Batman Begins', i'm willing to accept the fact that studios aren't willing to provide unlimited funds for films they might consider 'going out on a limb.'This movie would've been great if it had gone one of two ways: A goofy, campy, slaying story in the spirit of Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' series (which I thoroughly enjoy). Or, if it had closely followed the tone & story of the novel. This movie did neither of those. The ONLY resemblance to the book are some character's names. Here are my quarrels: 1.) A completely changed & rushed back story. What was so carefully plotted out in the book & gradually developed both story & character wise (so you can feel for Abe, his plight, motivations, feelings, & destiny) is now a completely different story with omissions of important characters, events, situations, mindsets, emotions, etc. & the addition of characters & situations not in the book. It's rushed through in approximately 5 minutes, leaving you wondering why you should give a crap at all. You have no connection with Abe, or any other character for that matter. I was actually stunned. 2.) There's a training sequence that's laughable, & approximately 3 minutes long, with some of the worst CGI ever.3.) Henry. His back story is unfortunately butchered & laughably unbelievable. As is his initial meeting (and ensuing friendship) with Abe. Gone is his meticulous nature, and important contributions to the story, and left is a husk of the character from the book.4.) And what's this crap about vampires can't kill their own? And how vampires are made vampires? The explanation for how vampires are made vampires is so ridiculous, you'll want to puncture your own eardrums for having heard it. 5.) Continuing omission of key characters & events which continually leave you detached from any characters or the story. Adam, & the female vampire (? name) are a prime example of additional made up characters shoe horned in the movie. If they had followed the original story they would have had more than enough material without needing to invent these two silly, cardboard characters,6.) Continuous, unemotional, passionless, mind numbingly repetitive 'Matrix' like slow motion vampire killing scenes. Silly fight in a herd of wild running horses....horse 'tossing'. 7.) Silly subplot about silver. It's not ever in the book as being harmful, or the making of weapons from them. (PS: writers...stop putting silver in vampire movies, save it for the werewolves.)8.) Mary Todd was never savvy to what her husband was up to. But here, less believably, distributing silver weapons out in the battlefield, where she could then have a stupid scene where she shoots the female (name?) vampire, who is running at her with full 'Ahhhhhhh!!' battle cry. But I guess the 'writers' figured they needed to amp it up & give her a scene where she does something.9.) I'm confused as to what happened at the end. Who is it in the bar? Why couldn't they just have had the ending they had in the book? The ending in the film reminds me of that ending from 'Interview with the Vampire' with Tom Cruise telling Christian Slater he's going to give him the choice he never had. Cheesy.Imagine my shock to find out that Seth Grahame-Smith was involved with the screenplay. SHAME ON YOU SETH! Did you have little creative control, or did you not care & sell out completely??!! Tim Burton should hang his head in shame too (even though he hasn't been involved with a quality flick since 'Sleepy Hollow')(with the 'possible' exception of 'Sweeney Todd'.) In my showing there was a group of gabby tweens who literally burst into giggles every time something happened on screen. Most of the time it was something that wasn't meant to be funny, but due to the nature of this 'film' -was. Normally this behavior annoys me, but I couldn't even get annoyed with them, as it was justified.So what did I like you might ask? If you're still reading. Well, I liked Benjamin Walker as I thought he looked the part, especially in Abe's later years, & he tried. But due to poor writing, and equally poor direction, his performance throughout the film is uneven and shockingly wooden as Abe in his younger years.I liked Dominic Cooper as Henry, who like Walker, did the best he could with the crappy material and direction, at least he had a little more passion in his performance. It's not his fault the script sucked.I liked that the vampires didn't sparkle.If you enjoyed or have any respect for the book this is 'based' on, I urge you to refrain from spending your hard earned money on a vastly overpriced ticket. You have been warned.",1,97,188,1 July 2012
Gravity," One of the best movies i've seen in a long, long time.
","I can count on one hand how many times i've seen a movie and have been completely, utterly enraptured and on the edge of my seat. Cauron once again proves his competency as a director and storyteller. (see the excellent: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban as reference to his excellent work.) This is one of them. I've seen it twice, once in 2D, and the other in 3D IMAX. The 2D experience:1.) Visuals: Absolutely breathtaking. The CG used here is so well done, and seamlessly blended I couldn't tell what was CG and what wasn't. The colors and rich and vibrant. 2.) Attention to detail. Was meticulous. I liked 'no sound in space' I liked that the only sound we had was in the presence of air, and the reverberation through and in the space suits of the using of tools, etc. I enjoyed the physics and realism, the sometimes clunky and awkward movements of the astronauts as they are limited by the bulky space suits, and lack of gravity or air pressure to assist.3.) Clooney and Bullock do a spectacular job, I was invested and concerned in the story and felt real emotions at the unfurling of events. I CARED what happened. 4.) I found myself leaning, shifting, and making gestures with my hands, face, feet, whatever (as if that was going to alter the outcome of what was happening.) Not to mention muttering under my breath 'look out!, 'go,go,go' 'grab that!' amongst other things.5.) The score was spectacular. (And not overwhelming,) powerful and appropriate. I believe this is Steven Price's first 'big' work. Well done.6.) Kept me guessing until the end. I honestly didn't know if this was going to be a happy ending. All the signs of good story telling.The 3D IMAX experience. (everything great from the 2D experience, and some bonuses!)3D is something I rarely invest in. Usually it's pointless, annoying and adds nothing significant to what i'm watching. It's just a way for me to part with extra $$ for no real reason and a disappointing experience. Gravity is an exception to the 3D rule. And seeing it in IMAX is a special treat. The expansive screen swallows you whole and makes you experience space and the unfolding events as if you were actually there. 3D is well done and well used. I've become accustomed in my 3D experience to things popping out of the screen towards the audience, things, in the foreground separated from the background, fireballs, etc. etc. etc. I cannot recall one instance in any of these previous movies where I actually flinched, blinked, and raised my hand up as if to protect myself from something coming at me.I did this for Gravity. To me that debris was coming straight at my head. To the naysayers and nit-pickers: all I'll say is 'really?!' How much better do you get? I dare you to find a more realistic space movie.Whatever way you view this movie, the important thing is you do. I highly recommend the 3D IMAX version (Something I rarely do.) Blu-Ray will be spectacular, but nothing will touch seeing this in a theater. Bravo gravity, Bullock, Clooney, Price, and especially you Cuarón. I will see you come awards season.10/10",10,5,10,11 October 2013
Memento," Overrated! Don't Waste your Time!!
","I've watched this movie a few times in a vain attempt to like it. Each time it actually became harder and harder to get through it.It's doing the 'Pulp Fiction' thing in the course it runs....yes I get it. I understand what's going on, but just because I understand it doesn't mean i'm going to like it. Pulp Fiction at least could string its 'backward' story together coherently and every single character was interesting and 'human'. Dull, dull characters, and a snoozing and an increasingly boring plot line suck any joy that you might be looking to get while viewing this trash. (I understand the concept of drama, or even a good 'who done it?' but for god sake do it correctly!) Unlikable characters and certainly none that you can relate to. The only remote bright spot I found with this movie was the performance of Joe Pantoliano and he couldn't even salvage this wreck. Pretty sad when a supporting character injects more interest in your movie than any of your main ones! The continuity (yes even is reverse) constantly contradicts itself, and is so much more over complicated than need be, that you just say 'oh the hell with it' about halfway through...that is if you haven't fallen asleep yet. I honestly am dumbfounded as to why this movie is so popular, and even more baffled as to what it's doing on the IMDb's top 250. The only thing I can figure is either a lot of people will vote '10' on anything that Christopher Nolan does; anything that could be considered 'alternative or indie' or that there's a trend occurring that anything that might be different from your standard movie 'must be cool.' Thank goodness Nolan redeemed himself with 'Batman Begins' & 'The Dark Knight' or I would seriously consider boycotting his future work.Absolute garbage abound with lousy writing, unconvincing and lousy acting and unengaging dull characters (except Pantoliano). Save yourself two hours of your life and see something else instead.",1,21,41,25 October 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Not bad overall, but lacking dimension
","Not a bad story overall, but I do have some nit-picky items i'd like to list.The Good: Jackman: Besides being pumped up visual eye candy, makes the character of Wolverine his own yet again. I thought he was fabulous in the X-Men movies, and he does a great job overall here too.Schreiber: Made a great and convincing Sabretooth. The chemistry he shared with Jackman was spot on and they worked well together.Reynolds, Kitsch, Monaghan, etc.: All the mutants who made an appearance in this film were great. I've no complaints as far as their depiction or who was assigned to play them. The scenery (esp. in Canada) is gorgeous and scenes are well shot. The musical score is impressive, battles are well done and engaging. The Adamantium scene is awesome and everything it should be. The opening credit scene depicting his long lifetime involving all these different wars is great.The Bad: Writing: was lacking and wooden in many spots, it left you wanting for something more, for the money and team they had invested in this, I honestly expected something better. Some of the dialog honestly had me wincing 'Walk until your feet bleed.....then....keep on walking.' Would be a good example.Too many shots of Wolverine looking up and screaming at the camera. He does it like 4 times...how many are really needed to add a dramatic effect?! He does it as a child over the body of his 'father', over the body of his girlfriend, etc. Lots of great characters, yet fails to really flesh out any of them. I'm just really not convinced enough of anyone's emotions to motivate their situation. Characters just seem to 'do' things, and with a 'rushed' feeling. Stryker is really the only one who's drive for what he's doing seems deep and driven. Even Wolverine is a SLIGHT casualty to this. I would have liked to have seen more of Deadpool (who could seriously have a whole movie devoted to him.), and Gambit.Even the 'death' of his girlfriend didn't convince me that was enough to drive Wolverine to the extreme and life altering decision to have that Adamantium grafted to his skeleton, it just seemed that there should have been more. Although I admit, I couldn't wait for the razor claws first appearance, or the metallic 'ping' that accompanied something or someone hitting him.Also, was Scott able to see through the visor device implanted on him by Stryker? I wasn't clear on that....if yes, than wouldn't he have recalled Wolverine later? It's not everyday that a buff, big haired, metal clawed guy frees you from a prison. My friend who went with me was pretty sure he couldn't see, but I think if he was safe wearing a $5 pair of ray bans to high school and was OK, then he was able to see through that special 'visor.'I know some people have complained about the beginning story, but it's pretty accurate to the 'Origin' comic. The bone claws, the killing, etc. So I don't have much complain about on that end other than, it's never explicitly stated that Wolverine and Sabretooth are brothers, it's implied, also they left out the 'Rose' character, who turns out, even after her death, to play an important role in Wolverine's psyche throughout his life. I think it would have been nice to include her. Overall though, it's not a horrible movie, the effects are great, and are never too over the top. Jackman is great, but what it's lacking does show through in areas. 6/10",6,0,3,2 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Pleasantly surprised!!
","I was nervous about a 'PG-13' Terminator film, so I put off seeing this for quite a while after it came out...however curiosity and being a fan of the other Terminator films won out.I have to admit I really enjoyed this movie. I needed the bad taste that was 'Transformers 2' washed away and this did the trick.The Good:Sam Worthington. One of the two best performances in the movie (he was recommended to McG by both Cameron & Russell Crowe.) It's nice to see that Terminator can still be a great story even if John Connor isn't your main focus. (and honestly it was about time some character rotation took place, no offense, I still love the other T films.) I really could feel emotion for and beside him (and his predicament.) I really wish they had given his character more development and room for a possible sequel or spin-off instead of his ultimately disappointing end.Anton Yelchin. Continually surprises me with the range he shows in his acting. He had huge shoes to fill with Kyle Reese, and he did a great job. At times I could actually feel him channeling the Kyle of T1 through him. Well done, between this and Star Trek he's having a great year!I thought the desolate look of the future was great. Thankfully McG directs masterfully and is the 'Anti-Michael Bay.' No sickening 'Cloverfield'esque shaky cam, or constant huge explosions needlessly in cities for the sake of just blowing things up. What's blown up here has a purpose for blowing up (for the most part.)I thought the story was OK, there wasn't a whole lot script-wise that bothered me or stuck out as dumb or corny. (There are a few sub-plots and dialog scenes that I can nit pick at, but nothing too major.) I liked the T-800 cameo too. (I know it wasn't really Arnold, but it really made for a nice connection to the previous movies.)The Bad:Christian Bale. Sorry, and i'm a Bale fan. He just seemed as if he was sleepwalking his way through. Although some of his performance comes across as genuine, most of the time it's borderline wooden. I also didn't care for the 'shallowness' portion that came through on his prejudiced feelings towards the machines, even though by now he's well into the war and know that with the right programming the terminators can be turned. (Also the writer's seem to have forgotten the experiences he's had in the past knowing it's possible for a terminator to learn and change.)The female element. Helena Bonham Carter is without a doubt the most interesting female in this movie, and her screen time is around 5 minutes. McG has said with his casting of Bloodgood he was hoping to continue with the 'strong woman persona' of the previous movies. But I fail to see that in her. There was nothing particularly memorable about her, nor that strong. Pure placement as a 'romantic interest' to be vulnerable around Worthington. Howard puts in a small role. There's nothing great about her, nor anything bad, she's just there. The pregnant wife/doctor. Since it was not deemed to advance her character at all, I can't say anything about her either way.The resistance is hidden underground in a secret labyrinth, avoiding any explosions, noise, lights, etc. as to avoid detection by the machines, but when Worthington's character escapes, all hell breaks loose above ground. Guys with lights and guns waving them about and shooting, multiple helicopters, not to mention a huge hell fire bombing of the forest terrain above. Even if they thought he was going back to report to the machines, would they really want to deal with all the enemy attention they have undoubtedly just drawn to themselves? As mentioned above, lame ending for Worthington. How can they even be sure that his heart would work and be compatible with John? And how lame is it to think that not only does John Connor have to worry about machines constantly coming after him, but life long possibility of organ rejection as well?! Even if the whole purpose for ending the movie was Worthington's character somehow die, you're telling me that's the best you can come up with?! Come on!But all in all, I thought it was a pretty good movie. It held my attention, was entertaining, and I didn't feel ripped off leaving the theater...will add to DVD collection. 8/10",8,2,4,29 August 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pirates...A Letdown...
","I'm an avid Pirates and Depp fan, such great fun it was watching the first movie in the theater! An imaginative, well written, well done movie...even the second Pirates, although nowhere near the first managed to build a satisfying cliffhanger at the end, enough anyway to want me see the third. AWE, (or LSD as it should be called.) is like 3 movies crammed into one. I saw it opening night, but had to wait for it on DVD so I could watch it and try to understand everything that was going on. Pointless plots and characters abound! And the plots in the story arc that may be remotely interesting are pretty much killed off or flushed away. Let me start with the issues I had with this film:1.) Shouldn't it have seemed to be harder to reach the world of the dead? A little too easy to get there if you ask me. All they really did was sail, and then fall over a waterfall. Shouldn't it have been some sort of trials, or adventure just to get there? (dare I say Clash of the Titans?? But that's just me.) Absolutely pointless 'eye candy' of a scene to show of 'neat' fighting skills with Sao Feng. By the time that scene was over, I had forgotten if there was a point to it. What a waste!2.) The reason I call it LSD. Which is what it seems you'd have to be on to understand any scene from the introduction of Jack Sparrow in this movie to the reappearance in the 'world of the living'. Hey, i'm all about mental insanity and hallucination caused by months of isolation or whatever causes people to go mad. What was up with the crabs from the rocks? WTF? How and why did that happen and what was the point, that all of a sudden here are all these 'rock crabs' carrying the ship to water. Hey whatever, but how about an explanation. Could we make insanity a little more interesting than multiple Jacks? Wouldn't one also be shocked to see all these people who showed up to rescue Jack, once he realized it was no hallucination, Especially Barbossa who you supposedly killed off long ago.3.) Davey Jones....wonderfully acted and portrayed (no problems here) treated like a punk in this movie...too complacent and not very true to the character. Jack Sparrow (played splendidly as usual by Depp). You're almost embarrassed for him by the endless 'trading' and lame lines he's to repeat. It's like watching football player signings for the season....only like, 6 seasons worth in 2 hours. 4.) Everybody backstabbing everyone else....over and over and over again. My god! And it seems as if it's a 'Spur of the moment explanation.' It's almost as silly as the new plots. I was also unimpressed by the usually great Hans Zimmer's score.5.) The plot(s) that were completely discarded that were actually interesting. Jones's plight could've been so much more interesting than it was. Although obviously a horrible and hardened creature, in 'Dead Man's Chest' you could almost see the human being who was agonizing underneath, abut a long lost love, and the tragic story behind it, and the possibility of redemption. Instead we get a ridiculous plot about a silly sea goddess (Calypso) being the long lost love, about 5 minutes of dialog exchanged between her and Jones. (Some schlocky crap like 'you broke my heart' 'you wouldn't have loved me any other way.' Huh? no resolution....and then his poorly done and anti-climatic demise. Calypso...talk about throwing in something silly when you realized the other 27 plots you had going you have no end for. I thought 'well this will probably be pretty interesting. Instead and laughably so she grows like the 50 foot woman, belts out something unintelligible and then turns into hundreds of crabs that fall into the sea, and cause a giant whirlpool for no other apparent reason than to make sure those CGI people were cranking out what you pay them for.The Marriage during battle.....(slaps forehead). I can't say Will is my favorite character but what a downer of an ending for him! Servitude for however long...see your love and child once every 10 years...wow...I need a shot of Prozac after that. Keira is back! And as anorexic and annoying as ever. Continuing on last movie's plot twist, she's as equally traitorous and out of character in this one. she was fine playing the eye candy, and a light candid role, but anything heavier than that is out of her league in this story, she brings a sort of 'caught in headlights' persona whenever some emotional scene arises. I didn't like her in the last half of DMC, and she's equally unlikable an unbelievable here.As much of a sleaze as we may think he is, the death of Norrington is lame!!! He had potential. the British navy thing, ridiculous, the father floating by in boat, silly, and purely plot advancement as he conveniently discloses some off screen plot advancement. OK if you're still with me, ii'll tell you something I did like about the movie...The return of Jack Sparrow to his scheming ways at the end! The stealing of the charts, and the little boat....priceless...and perfectly in the atmosphere of the first movie! I had to laugh! This whole point being, not a BAD film if you don't require any sort of coherent script, or you're looking to complete your DVD trilogy the FX are nice, and Rush, Depp, Nighy, Davenport, and Skarsgard are superb, everyone else makes you itch in your seat like a bad rash. ***** out of **********",5,2,3,22 January 2008
Sleepy Hollow," What more can you want?!
","Warning: POSSIBLE spoilers.What more could you want out of a horror movie? This has it all, a dark and convincing storyline, interesting characters, appropriate settings and cinematography, well done graphics and stunts and a talented cast of veteran actors. I'm a fan of Tim Burton's movies in general (with exception of Planet of the Apes.) He's a dark and gifted director, and has a talent for turning almost everything he touches into dark gold.So what if Ichabod Crane (played perfectly by Depp) is a police investigator instead of a school teacher? It works doesn't it? I give props to Burton also for casting Christopher Lee, and Michael Gough in this movie, however small the role. The cast is perfect for their respective characters. The only one I wasn't COMPLETELY sold on was Christina Ricci. I like Ricci, but still question whether this was her role. But none the less, her performance was acceptable. The real scene stealer here is the Headless Horseman, played appropriately and surprisingly (didn't know he was in it prior to viewing) Christopher Walken, he steals every scene he's in. Ray Park did a fabulous job as the 'headless' version of the Horseman. I won't get too much into the story, you probably know it, if not there's several hundred reviews regarding it. The cinematography is beautiful, dark, spooky and appropriate. (There is a real Sleepy Hollow, it's a few hours from where I live). Danny Elfman's score only adds an extra layer of darkness. One of the things I was impressed about the most was all the subtle background things incorporated into the scenes. (Check out the shapes in the flames that flare up in the fireplace at the midwife's house when the horseman is coming. Couldn't ask for a better horror movie, a true solid 10/10, one of Tim Burton's best works.",10,3,4,22 October 2008
Silent Hill," Disturbing
","And this is in a good way. I'm often wary of 'horror' films nowadays because just not scary anymore. This I think hit the nail on the head (at least in my view) where there is something so much more frightening about a film featuring visions like those twisted right out of a nightmare then mindlessly splashing blood around a screen.I'll give you a few examples: 'The Hills Have Eyes' remake for me was terrifying, this film creeped me out, even the 'Blair Witch' to an extent. Something about being helpless makes it all the more frightening. I've never played the games either.Little girl & mother get separated and lost in the world of 'Silent Hill.' Mother spends duration of movie searching for daughter, and on the way encounters a ghost town, a sky raining ash, and unexplained periods of complete darkness preceded by an air raid siren. Encountered in the darkness are some of the most twisted and terrifying creatures ever imagined. Small 'damned' people, an acidic spouting twisted creature, murderous nurses, the barbed wire finale and my favorites 'Pyramid Head' and 'Colin the janitor.' What really impressed me about this movie is that a great deal of the creatures and effects are NOT CGI'd! Of course some of it is out of necessity, but the 'creatures' and 'nurses' are dancers costumed in latex & makeup, they have the limberness and contortion needed for the part. Watching the special on how they made this movie is really quite fascinating. I still am not quite certain as to what exactly happened at the end of this movie though, and with certain scenes throughout with the husband trying to find her, but they couldn't see or hear each other b/c of alternate dimension thing. Still worth the watch and highly recommended though.BTW-Interesting 'factoid' the town 'Silent Hill' is based on the real life town of Centralia, PA, which has had a coal fire burning underneath for over 40 years, and has virtually rendered it a ghost town. I've been to Centralia and can verify this is true. Creepy.",10,0,1,25 January 2009
Watchmen," Watching the Watchmen
","I saw this in IMAX opening weekend, but wanted to wait to write my review until I had re-read the GN, and let my thoughts sink in.Overall I was blown away at the experience of having virtually every scene lifted perfectly from the GN and translated on screen here. I have a few quibbles, but none of them are large enough to have ruined my experience. God Bless Zack Snyder for sticking so closely to the novel and paying attention to so much detail from the illustrations.Malin Ackerman may be very pretty to look at, but to me was the weakest character in the film, I didn't care for her too much in the GN, and it hasn't changed much here..like in the GN she was just sort of....there. She's a plot device and little else. I also wasn't too sure about Matthew Goode, but the more I thought about it the more he grew on me. I thought he depicted just the right amount of arrogance and reasoning/intelligence. However small her part, I will never view Silk Spectre 1 as anyone else but Carla Gugino. Dr. Manhattan, was wonderfully portrayed by Billy Crudup, admittedly he was never my favorite character, but seeing him portrayed so accurately on the screen vs. pages of the book, really brought dimension to the inner struggle he has with himself, and rediscovering humanity. Crudup portrays him with just the right amount of subtly.I liked Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl 2. He did a great job as the bookwormish Dan Dreiberg, likewise as his alter ego. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was a spectacular Comedian, it's one of the few times I simultaneously despised a character and yet felt sorry for him, even if that is how the character is written, if pulled off incorrectly by the actor and director, it never works. He was the one who 'got the big joke' long before anyone else did.But saving the best for last I was completely blown away by Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Haley mesmerized me every second he was on the screen, and the scenes he wasn't in, I found myself eagerly anticipating the next one he was. Haley is to Rorschach what Ledger is to the joker. A stunningly deep and dimensional performance.There were some changes from the novel, but nothing that at least to me were that big of a deal. Missing was the 'giant squid' which didn't bother me in the least. There are some other minor subplots not included, but for time constraints I can understand. I could've done without the overlong sex scene though, Not even the GN devotes that many panels to it. In fact, you could cut the whole thing down to ten seconds and not miss anything. I do also, wish they'd devoted a little more time to the back story of Rorschach and to the shrink's interactions with him.Will definitely be getting this one on DVD 10/10. (*Recommend the 'director's cut' version on DVD*)*Just a few side notes. Tired of reading reviews whining about the 'big blue penis'. Get over it! You either have one, or most likely have seen one. If you're letting that be your deciding factor in this movie, you got problems. **Also, parents, it's rated 'R' for a reason. Whether or not it's as dark or violent, etc. to other 'R' movies you've seen. Kids have no business at all being at ANY 'R' rated movies. Get a sitter, and if you can't find one I guess you'll have to wait for DVD. Stop subjecting very young children on everyone else at the theater, and possibly scarring them with nightmares over material they're too young to understand! (There were no kids I could see at my IMAX screening, but i've read enough reviews here where someone had dragged in babies or 5 year olds.)",10,5,10,22 March 2009
Man of Steel," Swing and a Miss!
","'Man of Steel' is not just a failure on it's story, but a catastrophic meltdown right down to the fundamental core.1.) If you didn't have tinnitus going into the movie, you will when you come out. This is one of the most unnecessarily decibel cranking movies I have ever seen, that's not me being oversensitive, i've sat through plenty of loud movies. 2.) The Krypton story. I appreciate that time was taken to explore Superman's home planet, parents, and how he came to be on Earth. It's also when I started to become uneasy with this movie. Zod & co. are convicted and sentenced, and a huge spacecraft collects them for punishment.I could accept that perhaps this supposed advanced culture's arrogance stopped it from seeing it was doomed (I'll reluctantly give it a pass, it's been in every Superman i've ever seen, But why didn't Jor-el utilize a bigger ship? Surely he'd figure out how, or own one of his own. I didn't question this in the original Donner version because no Spacecraft scene was there, only the weird mirror. 3.) The Codex. Jor-el swims through fields of growing babies left over from the Matrix, grabs a skull, dissolves it, and infuses it into his baby. Couldn't we just stick with he obtained powers from passing through a sun? When you suck all the mysticism and wonder from a story, something is lost in translation. (that's you Star Wars prequels).Likewise this happens when you try to shovel in as much ridiculous crap as you can. 4.) Pa Kent. Wasn't this supposed to be the surrogate father that Clark loved, respected and who helped to mold him into a good man? Watch as he treats his son with indifference and coldness. His demise, a scene that is supposed to be powerful and poignant, is instead boiled down to a stupid action scene for no real reason at all. Costner really phoned this one in.5.) Some stories are means to be dark and full of drama and angst. Superman is not one of them, and it shows. It's a huge trend now to make every super hero story dark and depressing, this works great for comics like Batman or Watchmen, but backfires horribly for Superman,(Take a note from 'The Avengers' guys, it's possible to be successful and convincing without being dark all the time.) Am I saying he can't be frustrated, angry or upset? No, of course not. Reference again the Donner version for how this can be achieved properly and effectively.6.) Numerous miscasts. Don't care for Henry Cavill...I just couldn't get into him as Superman, and I tried, I really did, he just didn't convince me. Likewise on Amy Adams, who took me so far outside the character of Lois Lane there was no going back. She also lacks any chemistry what-so-ever with Superman.Fishburne is well...there, but nothing about him is memorable. Diane Lane is serviceable. 7.) Superman doesn't act like Superman, and may actually cause more casualties that any villain, device, in this movie. Huge buildings are destroyed, countless people are incinerated, crushed or seemingly blown up, and it goes on forever. This contributed greatly to the further removal of myself from the Superman character, frankly this molds him into more of a douchebag hellbent on personal vengeance than it does as a hero. (btw there is continuance here of the 'Jesus' savior references from the last movie..ridiculous.) There no way I could invest in him, I promise I tried, I did.8.) Other misc. stuff thrown in that bothered me. Lois in the Arctic, there was absolutely no reason for her to be there. The dumb Arctic spaceship and the equally ridiculous contents therein. The anti-climatic death of Zod.9.) Lois Lane on board with the army/Air Force with the baby ship. Why do movie makers constantly feel the compulsion to have characters do things for the sake of having them in some big action scene. Lois functions best as the snoopy reporter, and occasional damsel in distress. A few things I liked about the movie:1.) The terraforming machine was cool. I 'guess' I could buy the explanation about terraforming other planets. It's not the worst plot line they could've come up with. I liked the way the CGI/special effects for it were done.2.) General Zod. One of two characters I actually enjoyed. Too bad they didn't develop him more or give him some real dimension. But Michael Shannon does a great job. After a while his scenes were the only ones I looked forward to. At least he had some passion, conviction, and reasons behind him doing the things he's doing. After the disaster the rest of this movie is, you'll find yourself rooting from him. (um, filmmakers, this is what you intended right? You didn't want me to root for the hero did you?)Too bad we won't be seeing him again as Superman offed him horribly.3.) Jor-el was great. Russell Crowe did a great job. He was a highlight for me. There was more intensity and emotion in interactions between himself and Zod (both 'hologram' Jor-El and person Jor-el) than collectively between anyone else in the entire movie. Great job guys.Skip this one, you'll feel mad at wasting your hard earned money on the ticket. If you were a fan of the Donner series (I am.) Remember your hero as Christopher Reeve portrayed him, brave, honorable, kind, and properly angsty and emotional. 2/10 for Shannon and Crowe, and for some of the effects.",2,9,14,14 September 2013
Disturbia," Awful
","Are you serious? I wonder why this stupid movie has made even a penny. This movie would have been a thousand times better without the stupid teenage lust fest. It was not my turn to pick the movie, and I had no curiosity to see 'Rear Window Jr.' and boy I wish I listened to the inner voice! There seems to be an alarming trend that I call 'through the eyes of a teenage boy vision' You think from the way the director ordered so many shots of the teenage girl, that he had some crush on her! How about making a suspenseful movie that appeals to everyone, and not just males who have just exited puberty? Great job alienating your 'broad' audience.WAAAAAY too many shots of the 'hot' girl next door doing Yoga, slow-mo swimming, sun bathing, and your teenage angsty stuff. I like Shia, he was great in 'Holes', I even liked his cameo in 'I, Robot.' Poor David Morse, he's a tremendous actor, but given NOTHING to do here. What a waste of Carrie Ann Moss! There are a couple of 'shock' moments, but they appear and leave in the first 5 minutes of the film, after that, the teenage love puppy story sprinkled with tepid moments of 'tension'. This is a predictable, silly, unrealistic and awful movie. To quote another IMDb user..'why would someone who was so calculated and precise just start sloppily and obviously killing neighbor's?' Couldn't wait to leave, Giving a generous 2 stars for my respect of Mr. Morse and Ms. Moss, Shia, shame on you for being in a mess like this, you're much better.",1,92,169,7 June 2007
Ratatouille," I don't get why this is so popular
","I don't get it. After such awesome films like 'The Incredibles', 'Finding Nemo' and 'Monster's Inc.' you think you could trust on Pixar to put out top notch animation, engaging characters and a great story. I'm not sure what happened with this movie, because only 1/3 of that equation makes it....the animation.I'm not going to get too in depth with the story, which itself is pretty dull, because there's enough reviews that do that. Basically it's about a rat who can cook, and the human he uses as his puppet. There are plenty of characters in this movie, and yet you manage to care about none of them. Pixar, Disney, heck even Warner Brothers have proved time and time again that it's possible to make a movie involving animals (no matter which animals they were) that you care about, along with a compelling story that holds your attention throughout the entire thing. They failed massively on both fronts here.Enter Remy, the rat who can cook, but as you can imagine a rat cooking your food is disgusting, no matter how cute he may be. Linguini is an inept, dull, bumbling idiot and he never changes throughout the film. Colette is your stereotypical tough girl trying to prove something in a mans world. The rest of the kitchen staff are barely worth a mention as they serve as a dull backdrop and little else. The voice acting is OK, I really was surprised as to why they decided on Janeane Garafalo (who I LOVED until recent years when she's seemingly gone crazy (political, etc..) Why not just get a French actress? And what executive looked over the story board and said 'oh yeah...Janeane Garafalo.' People like Will Arnett and Brian Dennehy are wasted and nearly invisible as it could have been anyone voicing those very minor parts. John Ratzenberger of course surfaces as it is his custom to voice some character in every Pixar film. The ONLY interesting characters worth a mention are Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) and Skinner (Ian Holm) as a ruthless well known food critic/head chef and owner of Gusteau's (respectively.) They seem to be the only actors putting any effort into the voice expression of their characters. (O'Toole as usual is excellent whether it be live action or animated.) Remy is cute. I'll give him that. Kids will like him, he's otherwise pretty boring. I'm sorry but the idea of rats in the kitchen no matter how cute is still unappealing to me. The small ghost of the deceased master chef Gusteau is just an odd addition, I never fully got why he was there other than to act as a sort of Jiminy the Cricket or 'shoulder angel' to Remy and even then he didn't really do anything. In a nutshell, just a real BORING movie for both kids and adults. The animation is excellent, but I would expect nothing less from Pixar. But the story and characters are pretty much complete crap (except for O'Toole and Holm's characters.) My advice, just skip this one and cross your fingers that Pixar's next venture is vastly better.",3,6,14,9 December 2008
Twilight," clichéd, wooden, awful dreck
","I contemplated seeing this in the theater, just to see what the fuss was all about. I'm sincerely glad I dodged that bullet, instead waiting for the DVD.This movie is nothing more than porn for tweens who are anxious to drool over Pattinson or Stewart, although I can understand Pattinson's dark, brooding appeal, he's got talent, it's a shame that neither the director or the screenwriters chose to use any of it. Instead he's reduced to a emo, glaring, statue. Stewart was absolutely terrible. She was so wooden, that I kept looking for strings attached to her body. She consistently holds the same monotone voice, same expression, and sleep walks through the movie. Nothing of the unworldly events, or shocking revelations, or uprooting her character experiences seems to shock, please, sadden, etc. her at all, she just holds that tranquilized expression through everything. Also, her delivery of lines is horrendous, awkward delivery, and pauses where none should be, one could almost feel violent waiting for her to finish the simplest of sentences. Let's not even get started on the group of friends.Mostly I was left confused with what I considered to be a poorly written tepid storyline. Edward glitters like a craft store special when in the sun, he and his clan hunt and drink blood from animals rather than people, and play baseball. There's one 'climatic' 'matrix-esque' battle with some evil vampires., all because this girl and whatever she emanates is like vampire cocaine. Yay.Never was I convinced of any great love between the two leads. There were one or two moments where I felt an almost warmth or desire between their characters, otherwise I was mostly bored at the endless staring scenes, Edward's apparent 'bi-polar' behavior as he apparently has some inner-war with himself about Bella, 'I love you, but it's dangerous for us both to be together.' Give me a break.Not to mention some very strange adults....Bella's mom and dad show about as much concern for her as a piece of moldy fruit found in the refrigerator, the whole family text messages one another, and no one seems to give a squat what happens with anyone else.I haven't read the book, and seeing this movie gives me no desire to do so either. I have read Anne Rice's series on vampires, and enjoyed it immensely as she had the ability to fill in characters, and personalize them so well, you feel for them even through the text of the page. This movie however, what a fault ridden waste of time!",1,7,9,18 June 2009
Cars," A great, fun film!!!
","I really am surprised that this isn't on the top 250, while that atrocity 'Ratatouille' is. This is easily ten times the movie that one was. It's a kids flick of course, but made for adults too. An all out celebrity cast fills out the cars' personalities including the late greats Paul Newman and George Carlin. It's a sweet little movie about the meaning of family, friends, helping out others and not just thinking about yourself all the time. Keep an ear out for some extraordinary cameos (Jay Leno, John Ratzenberger and Michael Keaton most notably.)The animation is excellent, the music is great the story is interesting and holds your attention the entire time. I also love all the little incidentals they threw in (notice the flies are actually tiny little cars??!!) The attention to detail is absolutely amazing. Roads have real texture, grass, sand and plants look real, etc. And for the kiddies some great moral lessons and is very touching. I've read other reviews on here that stated they didn't 'get' or 'like' the movie because they weren't that into cars or Nascar. That's like saying you didn't like 'Finding Nemo' because you don't have an aquarium. It's just silly, this is a great movie for everyone. The characters were great, my personal favorites besides the lead would have to be 'Mater' and 'Doc Hudson'. It's a safe engaging film from a lot of garbage being cranked out nowadays. I'm not going to review specifics about the film, it speaks for itself. 10/10",10,0,0,21 December 2008
Ghost Rider," Great movie if you're not analyzing it to death
","I saw this opening day. If what you're looking for is to be entertained and nothing else, this is a great movie for you! I'm not a big reader of comic books, I am familiar with most of the characters and basic story lines and enjoy most of the movies made from them.Cage is a fan of Ghostrider. He even has a tattoo of him and it seemed like he had a genuinely good time making this movie and in my experience that always makes a movie more fun. So what if he had a hairpiece? How many movies have you seen with actors that had hair different from their's in real life? Eva Mendes is OK, playing you're generic love interest. Wes Bentley looks and acts creepy enough, but i'll admit there are times where you're wanting more from him. This is not his fault, it's the result of an underdeveloped script. Matt Long & Raquel Alessi are wonderfully matched to the older Cage and Mendes as they look almost exactly alike. Peter Fonda as usual turns in a great performance and seemed to really be enjoying himself. Sam Elliott as always is great and Donal Logue does the best he can as 'Mack' a generic & thankless role of Johnny's friend and manager. I'll admit the script could've been better and a better story come out of it. It's not that it wasn't an interesting story, it was just a bit sloppy and sometimes weak & corny. (Johnny's mannerisms of listening to the Carpenters, eating candy, etc., this could be the way he was in the comics, but I don't know, never having read them.) It just was never convincing to me as a motorcycle riding tortured soul. The villains also, came across as too easily defeated. Not that there were a lot of them, but for your main baddie, if you spent most of your movie hyping him up and showing what he's capable of at least give him a matched and worthy fight on the way out. The special effects are nothing short of amazing and convincing, and are the best part. If you have the ability to sit back, relax, and allow yourself to be entertained, Ghostrider delivers. Besides, what's cooler than a motorcycle riding flaming skeleton purging evil?? 6/10",7,2,4,8 June 2007
Stardust," almost flawless fantasy/adventure
","This is one of those rare movies that I actually enjoyed more than the book it was based on. In fact I have almost no complaints about the film at all. I liked the way the story was written, the dialog was fine, the cinematography was great, and the CGI was right where it should have been, playing a supporting role instead of dominating the movie and in your face. My interest was held and there was more than enough suspense. The transformation of the handsome Charlie Cox from fumbling dork into handsome prince was done believably and he was convincing in the role of Tristan. Michelle Pfieffer (as always) was gorgeous, luminous and perfect. Deniro turns in a great performance as a closeted, cross dressing sky pirate, Peter O'Toole was a surprisingly pleasant cameo, and I really liked the way the ghosts of the brothers watched invisibly from the sidelines as they were offed one by one. The only real complaint I have is the casting or Claire Danes & her accent. The accent to me was completely off and I thought, why not cast the British born Sienna Miller in the role of Yvaine and Danes in the minor role of Victoria? Or even another actress for Yvaine all together (for some reason i'm thinking Julia Stiles would've been really cute.) It's not that I dislike Danes, I just think she was kinda miscast. Even with the Danes casting the movie still is more than worth the watch. Lots of adventure, magic & fantasy. A lot better IMO than the book it was based on.",9,1,2,24 November 2008
The Hurt Locker," Ridiculous, over-hyped, clichéd, inaccurate & grossly overrated.
","I remember several years ago watching 'Saving Private Ryan' with my grandfather, a WW2 vet, who also survived storming the beach that day. Ten minutes into the movie he had to leave the room, because of how 'real & accurate' the beach scene was for him. I think i've made my point. Bigelow needs to learn from this kind of example. It's possible to recreate a scene/war realistically.I have a few friends who have bravely served in Iraq, most, more than one tour of duty in infantry, tanker, equipment mechanic, etc., who put their lives in danger patrolling streets, dodging gunfire, detecting IED's, in some cases assisting to disarm and quarantine off areas, & processing the gruesome aftermath of an incident, or suicide bomber.That being said, from the previews, & ridiculous hype, I figured this was going to be a no holds barred, gritty, realistic peek into the everyday life of American Soldiers more specifically, bomb tech soldiers.I realized the inaccuracies start almost immediately, no skilled soldier in his right mind would've let that guy with the cell phone even start dialing...he would've been shot dead right away, IED units, patrolling alone, soldier wandering on vigilante mission alone in the night through dangerous Baghdad, are just some of the dangerous situations you can expect to see, glaring errors even to a non military observer.No team leader would EVER risk the lives of his entire team plunging them into nighttime, uncharted territory 'on a hunch' because he feels that whomever set up/detonated this nighttime bomb was surely hiding in the shadows watching. When in truth, they likely would've been long gone, blended in with the locals, if they were in the vicinity at all.No team would've tolerated the rogue, 'wild card' bomb tech, who repeatedly defies orders & odds, placing his entire team at risk, time & time again. In the words of my friends 'would've zip tied his a** and thrown him in the back of a Hum Vee first.' Do I need to go on? Ladies & Gentlemen, who else is going to know what's wrong with this picture more than the people who were there for real?The main actors are clichéd cookie cutter cutouts. I found myself not caring about any of them as they meandered through the predictability of the movies as one cliché after another was rolled out: the various types of bombs, the shady terrorists, the doctor who is killed, ironically while on his first voyage out into the field, the angry by the books soldier, the 'wild card', rule bending soldier, the innocent, sweet, soft spoken soldier. The done to death conversations and 'coming to term' conversations. 'By the books' soldier clashes with 'Wild Card', but in the end, likes & respects him, despite his crazy methods, and realizes himself, he's overcome his fear of procreation, and indeed, wants children. 'Wild Card' has trouble adjusting to civilian life, and in a dull scene, realizes he loves 'one thing', which left me wondering, 'is it war he loves?, or his son?'Not one storyline is deep enough for me to give a crap what happened to any of them. Camera work is sloppy, & abrupt (not quite to Blair Witch levels, but irritating enough), if a director is going for a realistic camera situation, I think it's more important to not have to take Dramamine when watching it. Ralph Fiennes & Guy Pearce also throw in a much too short cameo as apparently ridiculously inept British Officers, (their appearance subconsciously beckon you into wanting to watch a better film.) They of course are taken out by terrorist snipers occupying the only structure within eyesight. The Academy needs a serious overhaul...it's absolutely shocking to me that this won 'Best Picture'. It's fine that someone wants to make a movie about the day to day of soldiers in Iraq, but for gods sake, at least make it accurate.2 stars--for Fiennes & Pearce, & for the sets & locations...which are the best things about the movie.",2,20,30,27 March 2010
Transformers," Transformers....now 95% Transformer free!!
","I happily bough my ticket opening weekend and settled in to be entertained, instead I left massively disappointed feeling as if a part of my childhood had been stolen from me.Michael Bay just should retire, and move to a small island where he can do no more harm to anyone else's beloved memories. I was very anxious to see Shia Lebouf pull off a performance worthy of his ability as an actor, I badly needed the memory of 'Disturbia' wiped from my memory. Although Shia doesn't seem to be having a bad year, it's 'hot babe convenience' seems to be running his adolescent years quite well. I had no problems with Shia in this film fortunately, he portrayed a more realistic, less clichÃ© ridden teenager than in that waste of time Disturbia. Once again Michael Bay's objectification of women shines through in brilliant clarity....taking the forms of Megan Fox, and Rachael Taylor (the former, a hot chick who also knows all about cars and really isn't snotty, the later, a top of the line computer 'code hacker' of some sorts who is hired by the Pentagon to crack some signal code....she looks about 15 years old.) Never for a minute did I believe any one of these ladies...and i'm not saying women can't be beautiful and intelligent, but how about being realistically portrayed? Nothing in the 'Pentagon mystery code' was complicated enough to convince me why the guy cleaning the building couldn't have made this connection!Anthony Anderson shows up with the comic relief. This time, he's a super hacker trying to be funny, be amazed as the movie about giant transforming robots treats you to scenes of Anderson scarfing down an entire plate of donuts by himself, and yelling at his grandmother to drink her prune juice.The storyline could've used more Megatron (esp a transforming Megatron), more Transformer scenes (they aren't revealed until late into the movie). Less emphasis on the angsty teenage portion (who really cares?!) Marvel at one scene where it's broad daylight, and the next when it's pitch black at night. (Guess your continuity people took a big nap.)The forehead slapping, overlong scene of the Transformer's stumbling around the backyard like a bad episode of Mr. Bean, knocking things over, crushing flowers, and saying things like 'oops' and 'my bad'. Awful. YOU feel embarrassed! It's also really difficult to tell who's who in these robot battles, and all the decepticons look the same, so it's difficult to tell what robot is entering a battle or a scene. Also, why didn't they leave Prime's face mask on? He looks way cooler with it, without, he just looks like some sort of a metal bug with these weird lips.The climatic battle? In the middle of a major city? Not likely, even for the most dull witted hero. As far as I can figure out they did this for 'more stuff for robots to knock over, and for humans to climb on, and for Bay to blow up.'On the up side, Shia didn't annoy me, it was awesome that Peter Cullen voiced Optimus, I always liked Bumble Bee, but why change his car for the flashy stick out like a sore thumb Camaro? He could've at least been a new VW bug. Sam's dad is funny. (The mother however makes you want to hang yourself with a shoelace.) John Turturro, (i'm still wondering what he's doing in this movie, and if he really needs a paycheck that badly.) Not the worst movie i've ever seen, but nothing I care to watch again. 4/10",4,0,2,14 August 2007
The Dark Knight," superb
","I'm near speechless when it comes to describing this movie. Saw it opening weekend (regular sized screen as my local IMAX was sold out for DAYS.) And the pleasure to see the re release on IMAX (finally!)The cinematography is astounding. Especially in IMAX). Nolan does an excellent job directing. The score is exquisite and powerful in supporting the actions and emotions. The CGI is kept to a minimum and supports the story and scenes instead of overpowering them. (Take a lesson Lucas!!!) Bale is hands down the best Batman of the 'Batman' franchise. He captures the emotions and conflicts of Bruce Wayne perfectly and that of his alter ego Batman. I'll be disappointed if they make another Batman movie in this series and start replacing Batmans. And no, the 'growley' Batman voice didn't bother me. Eckhart was a good choice for Gotham's white knight. He's convincing and easily able to make a believable transition from city hero to the bitter, disfigured twisted psyche required for Two Face.The support cast as always is excellent. Freeman & Cain return, as does Oldman, who as always disappears into his role. Gyllenhaal is an awesome replacement for Katie Holmes. She gives the character of Rachel Dawes some dimension, emotion, and life, unlike Holmes's wooden, shallow portrayal. And last but not least. Heath Ledger. There's not a word that exists that could adequately describe his performance as the Joker. Superb? Mind Blowing? Excellent? Chilling? Astounding? All these words don't even seem to measure up to level of performance that is given. As the Joker, he's frightening, psychotic, chaotic, twisted, evil, chilling. Ledger doesn't just play the Joker, he disappears into his character as 'an agent of chaos.' Ledger IS the joker. To say the least, I was absolutely blown away. As far as i'm concerned, there is nobody else even in that Oscar Cattegory. The void left behind by Ledger's tragic death is still felt, and will be for a long time to come. (Especially after viewing the Dark Knight.) Just Excellent. 10/10",8,1,7,27 January 2009
From Hell," Awful, an insult to Depp and Coltrane
","This was a depressing, awful, dark, dank, and damp (OH GOD was it ever damp, This version of London has to be the wettest i've ever seen.)Although going full well into this movie knowing it was based on the macabre and mysterious Jack The Ripper, it was more depressing, insulting, boring, and bland than it was suspenseful and scary.It's sad too, because it appears the Hollywood machine went full force in recreating 19th century London, CGI, costumes, and props. It Could have been a great, terrifying suspenseful mystery adventure. Instead it takes a little Alan Moore, history, and mixes in a terrible script. I actually cringed at the awful, screeching Cockney accents provided by the non British/UK actors and actresses. (Depp was OK though, his being mellow and not seemingly screeched at the top of his lungs like the 'unfortunates' was.)There was no chemistry what-so-ever between Depp and Graham, at no time was I convinced of their attraction to each other, or of their predictable 'romance', if you could call it that. Depp seemed to sleepwalk his way through most of this picture, (I wish I could've done the same.) The 'unfortunates' are portrayed as the dumbest group of screeching harpies I have ever seen spread across the screen. How many moments of stubborn pride 'I won't take charity from nobody' 'I'm not a whore', 'I wasn't always a whore.' 'I need to work to live/eat.' moments did you count? Especially from Graham? Even late into the movie, as all her friends lay horribly slain, she still stubbornly sticks her nose in the air with these ideas rather than just taking the money offered to her (and at this point it should be quite obvious that it's not someone trying to get in her pants) and getting the hell out of dodge. It's nothing more than a bad script setup to share a 'passionate' kiss with Depp.The killer story, for one of the most infamous and gruesome murderers in all of history is really quite boring, and lacking any mystery and aforementioned 'suspense.'I felt sorry for Depp and Coltrane, I really did. Having seen them both in much, much better roles, at least the friendship and work between the two of them was comfortable and convincing. It's too bad that no one involved in writing/producing/directing this disaster decided that anyone else should be.Want to see a movie done right with Depp as a detective? I suggest 'Sleepy Hollow.'2/10 for Depp & Coltrane.",2,3,6,15 June 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Elaborate 2.5 hour GM commercial, teen love story, with some robots thrown in
","I put off seeing this for over a month until all the fuss died down.What a dragging dog of a movie! Just who was this movie supposed to be aimed for? Testosterone filled jocks? The Bad: The plot, was really convoluted and awful. Half the time it moved so quickly, and so many new twists were thrown in at breakneck speed that I had no idea what was going on.The toilet humor & general unnecessary grossness. 2 dogs humping each other repeatedly, really overlong and embarrassing stoned scene involving the mother eating a pot brownie and running around campus like a fool. Every minute she's on screen is excruciating.Bots performing bodily functions such as puking, farting, and crying were terrible, and absolutely unnecessary.That small 'Pesci-bot'. Even worse later in movie when Pesci-bot humps Megan Fox's leg.The 2 'ghetto-bots' who were the worst 'comic relief' and blatant racist characters i've ever seen. Jar Jar, take a seat, you might've met your match. How they got away with them is beyond me. This movie has an obsession with testicles like you wouldn't believe. Whiny roommate complains at least 2-3 times about his being flattened, squished, fell on, tasered, etc. Not to mention the large 'destructo-bot' than assembles itself at the end has big balls....literally. The bot has 2 large wrecking balls hanging between it's legs. Who's idea was this?! Female decepticon ripped right from 'Terminator.' That's right, hot chick who's really a robot....she even walks in menacingly slow style, expressionless and all.Once again during the drawn out big battles, it's hard to tell who's who, and who's on what side doing what. Bots are left and right, and often times changing so quickly it's difficult to appreciate the complexity of the robot, or all the thought that went into the CGI as everything's so dam fast all the time.I still see not much reason for Megan Fox other than the eye candy love interest. She doesn't say or do anything interesting, or add much to the story. Revlon and Collagen must be happy for the promotions she's brought to them.The 'Say I love you first' sub plot is painful and ridiculous, it's would be like watching a movie with two people on the phone saying 'hang up.' 'no you hang up.', 'no YOU hang up first.' Crossing borders with armed guards is as easy as saying 'We're from NY.' and they're waved right in, no passports, no searches, nothing. Are you kidding? I've been given bigger hassles at Canadian bridges WITH my passport.Human visits robot heaven...'nuff said.'Old fart' robot. Complete with cane, he can barely walk, and mummers his way through long boring stories, but he's a sophisticated jet who flies and warp travels with no problem.....give me a break.The tag-along roommate was irritating as hell.How is it with all these major daylight battles, some of which are at prominent famous landmarks is the gov't still managing to keep these robots under wraps? They must be working hand in hand with the guys at MIB.These are just some of the generalized things that make no sense.Nitpicky: I thought it was strange that Sam's father remarked about him being 'the first Witwicky to go to college.' They live in suburbia California, in a pretty nice modern home with all the creature comforts, and look to be at least a comfortable income. Just what in the hell does his dad do for a living to afford all that? There's not a whole lot of people I know who didn't go to college who are living that comfortably, and some of the one's who did don't.Elaborate 2 1/2 hour commercial for GM, and the Army. Not that I have a particular problem with either but most of the robots function little other than to show off GM's new line of cars and the cool things they can do. Likewise the Army guys over the top parachuting antics.The good: Optimus Prime is awesome. Though the story about the primes is kinda hokey, he's still kicks butt.Bumble Bee: Always did like him, they still haven't given him the screen time he deserves, but it's pretty cool to see him back in one piece and fighting fearlessly. I do still wish he'd remained as the VW bug. Camaro, although cool, is too noticeable....too flashy.Some of Shia's humor is OK.The sound effects can be pretty cool at times.Sam's dad isn't actually all that bad. He's funny without making you want to jab something into your eye.John Turturro. period. I like John, i'm still trying to figure out what he was doing in the first one, more or less the sequel. Picking up a little vacation paycheck apparently. I was mildly amused at the butt shot tho, as I was amused by his Sector 7 under-gear in the last movie, I don't know, he's a good actor, i'm just still trying to figure out what he's doing in these movies.A real dragging headache inducing classic Michael Bay boobs & explosion fest. 2/10",2,2,7,10 August 2009
Love Actually," Terrible actually
","How do you have a stellar cast: Rickman, Nighy, Firth, Thompson, Neeson, Knightly, Grant, Linney, etc. And have such a terribly depressing, dull, boring movie???!I really looked forward to this mostly because of the cast. It was actually embarrassing watching them play out a script that was surely pounded out by a group of attention deficit apes. Whoever wrote this movie had absolutely no concept on what romance apparently is. It's more a depressing demonstration on the effects of keeping your mouth shut, staying together out of habit or for the children, and carnal lust over someone with the depth of a parking lot puddle. There was absolutely nothing redeeming, funny, or romantic about any of the stories or people involved in them, and the one couple (Rickman & Thompson) who you remotely find interesting spend the movie building up a semi acceptable story that completely falls flat without any passion or resolution. Rickman contemplates cheating, or does actually cheat (you never know) she finds out and confronts him on it, and that's it, nothing more, you never find out what happens. There's just some lame robotic like kiss at the airport. I was actually insulted. It doesn't help that any of the couples except for Thompson & Rickman lack any chemistry together whatsoever, and even then Thomapson & Rickman are dull as dishwater. Whomever wrote the part for Linney did a poor job. She started off good, but fell flat on her face as were forced to accept her role as an apparent forever enslaved spinster. The tragedy is that most of these actors have either won or at least been nominated for Oscars and have actually proved their guts in romances Thompson (Sense & Sensibility), Grant (Four Weddings & A Funeral), Rickman (Truly, Madly, Deeply), Firth (Bridget Jones), Linney (The House of Mirth) need I go on?I'll never recapture the time I spent watching this, and i'm getting upset thinking about it, but hopefully my review will help you in not wasting your time with this one. A horrible waste of a group of very talented passionate actors.",2,7,11,20 December 2008
Hancock," solid first hour turns into convoluted mess
","I really enjoyed the first hour of this movie. Smith plays an unlikable 'anti' hero who seems to do more damage than good as he fights crime in Los Angeles. People hate him, and he doesn't seem to care one bit. That is until he saves the life of flaky, but kind hearted Bateman, who becomes his friend and vows to change his image.I thought it kind of dumb that the city of Los Angeles wanted to jail Smith for all the property destruction his hero antics has caused throughout the years, seeing the fact that he's invincible and there's not a jail house that exists that could contain him. I thought: 'You people don't know that?' I thought likewise about the criminals that he encounters once he voluntarily incarcerates himself. He put a good lot of them away himself, they attempt to antagonize and bully him. If anyone knows what he's capable of it would be them, and they still are going to try to harm him? The whole scene exists so that Smith makes good on a threat about putting someone's head somewhere where the sun don't shine.I thought, 'OK.' It strange, but not enough to throw off the movie. The real trouble starts when it's revealed that Theron is also a superhero, I could actually hear the movie spiraling downhill.Not only was it unnecessary and stupid, it's also convoluted and hokey. It didn't take me long to get angry at the movie for taking such a lame turn. Apparently Smith and Theron are some sort of superhero star crossed lovers who turn mortal and are able to get hurt when near one another. He of course has amnesia, and remembers none of this. Stupid? Yes. Especially considering that for the first hour he was around her plenty and never lost any of his powers. Of course, conveniently this is the point where a couple of jail-house thugs break out and go after him. I'm not sure if they possessed any superpowers themselves, or just knew about the vulnerability of Hancock turning mortal. I wasn't interested enough to pay attention. Anyhow, Smith & Theron are mortally wounded and almost die, but don't, Smith musters up enough power to 'go away' thus restoring their powers and saving them both. He lives and moves to fight crime another day in New York City or some other unnamed metropolis. The movie would've been great if it kept the straightforward, simple plot established in the first hour. Instead it sinks into an overcomplicated, soggy, ultimately disappointing lazily written, second half. Smith does a good job in the movie, and tries to do the best he can with the sloppy second act. I like Bateman. The movies i've seen him in he's played everything from a straight laced accountant (Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium) to a smarmy jerk (The Ex). He plays his role convincingly & straightforward here, and thankfully doesn't contribute to the over-complication. Theron, unfortunately I cannot vouch for. I've seen her in great roles, and know her flexibility as an actress. Her role in this movie could've easily been played by anyone, not to mention reduced. A script overhaul, especially regarding her character and the plot involved with it would've done this movie a solid. It's not a god awful film, but you'll leave disappointed after experiencing what was a great first hour.",4,1,3,15 February 2009
WALL·E," Well, at least the animation is good
","Because nothing else about this movie is likable. I said it about Ratatouille and i'll say it again for this movie. After such amazing films as 'Finding Nemo', 'Monster's Inc.' and 'Cars', I thought I could depend on Pixar for a great story, engaging characters and top notch animation, here, as with Ratatouille only one third makes it....the animation!!After hearing all the hype about this for months and months, I rented it out. This has to be one of the dullest movies i've seen in a long time. Worker robot (Wall E) who trash compacts alone on the pollution scorched Earth(which by the way, how successful is he working by himself on a whole PLANET?!!) becomes lovestruck with robot scanner droid sent to find vegetation. He spends the duration of the movie in pursuit of said Scanner Droid (Eve). A ROBOT LOVE story? Give me a break! Robots do just what they're programmed to do, they lack emotions, or even the capacity to feel or develop them. At least offer me a reason why a robot would have emotions, especially a trash compacting worker bot.The movie is so dull, boring and repetitive that I was actually shocked. Aside from that the not so subtle hit you over the head concepts of 'pollution is bad, and we need to act now.' Humans are also fat lazy, slobs who look like large doddling infants having grown morbidly obese with lack of mobility. Aside from the herd of humans, the only other characters are the aforementioned robots and a couple of other late in the movie robot sidekicks. None of them manage to be interesting, and I honestly could care less what happened to ANY of them. Wall E himself, i'll have to admit is interesting looking. If 'Johnny 5' from the 'Short Circuit' series and 'Herb' the dish-washing robot from the underrated 'Robots' movie, had a child, it would look like Wall E. 'Eve' reminds me of a Japanese toy robot. Overall I really can't complain animation wise.Both robots barely speak more than their own names, or each others names throughout the film. It really grates on your nerves after a while. Anyhow, I guess besides the not to subtle 'green' plot, the whole point is for 'Eve' to bring back a seedling/weed to a giant spaceship filled with the obese humans, so they can go and return to the now 'clean' Earth. Wall E, of course inadvertently becomes part of this plot when his love sickness causes him to hitch a ride on the ship carrying Eve to the large spaceship. There's some crap about the 'auto pilot' not wanting to return to the Earth despite the captain's orders (BTW-do any other 80's nerds think that the 'auto pilot' looks like 'Max' the pilot robot from 'Flight of the Navigator?') Good of course triumphs as the human pilot and the robots win, and are taken back to Earth. Of course when they get there Earth is not renewed completely as it still is filled with cubes of scrap and some scattered weeds/seedlings. I felt like standing up and saying. 'Yeah, you thought it was gonna be like in the pictures didn't you?!!' With how morbidly obese they appear it'd be a miracle if they were able to help with restoration at all! Besides, with all the mysterious dust storms that were seen over the course of the movie, how the hell did those vulnerable seedlings even survive?! Here are the things I liked about the movie: Sigourney Weaver's voice, John Ratzenberger's obligatory Pixar cameo, and Wall E's pet roach who believe it or not is the best character in the movie. The only time I laughed when it was something roach related. Kids are probably to young to appreciate the subtle humor 'factoids' about the almost indestructibleness of the roach. This little guy is squashed or vaporized at least 3 times and just gets right back up, brushes off and continues like nothing happened (pretty much like a real roach.) Also, I didn't fail to notice that on apocalyptic Earth seemingly the only things to survive would be roaches and twinkies (both probably very true!) Giving 3/10 for animation, and the roach/twinkie thing. In the meantime i'll keep my fingers crossed for the old Pixar formula on their next venture.",3,10,23,11 January 2009
The Woman in Black," I was, and still am mad at myself for watching this
","I'm happy that the $1 I paid to rent this movie went to a good cause in supporting my local library. That being said, it's one of the only positives about this movie experience. Dreary, dull, meandering and boring. A yawn inducing ghost story, that offers little more than long drawn out scenes, un-suspenseful build up, no pay off, not even jumps or scares. There was at no time that I cared or was interested in the 'story'. There were no characters that I really cared for, and nothing that particularly impressed me. Basically, an idiot stays in a house, long after anyone with any common sense would have said 'the hell with all this' and left. A CGI ghost that also shares a boring story, and isn't scary or believable....mind numbing. And some toys, which are easily the creepiest part of the movie.The only remotely interesting scene I can give this movie credit for is the bringing up the carriage from the bog. There you go...that's the best 5 minutes of the movie right there.I also did like Ciarán Hinds, who did the best he could with a boring story and a terrible script. It's hard to care for your movie when you just don't care about your characters, the story, or what happens in general. I am still mad at myself for wasting the time to watch this. I think Radcliffe is a great actor, and versatile. I understand that he probably wants to try new things outside of Harry Potter. But the only ghosts he should stick with are The Bloody Baron, and Nearly Headless Nick. I cannot force myself to give this anything above a one, even though I liked Ciaran Hinds...sorry Ciaran.",1,10,19,26 January 2013
Tombstone," great western, visual eye candy
","Seen both versions with both Costner & Russell. Must say I prefer this one. As a previous IMDb reviewer stated ('Kilmer & Russell together in the same picture is a treat for the ladies.') I'd have to agree, not only visually appealing, but also very talented actors.With that being said, this is a great ensemble cast. Russell, Kilmer, Eliott, Paxton. They work well together and make their respective characters in history come to life. Also keep your eyes peeled for cameos by Billy Zane, and a chubby Billy Bob Thorton.It's a simple story and it works. While others scream about any historical inaccuracies, Costner was better, etc. The fact remains that Costner's version was BORING. If your idea of seeing a movie is to be entertained, than Tombstone delivers.I just want to take a minute and reflect of Kilmer's performance, Definitely a highlight of the film. Kilmer is a talented actor, and I like him, his portrayal of Doc Holliday is nothing short of captivating. You're mesmerized by him when he's on screen as he steals every scene he's in. The real Doc Holliday was an educated man from Georgia (a trained dentist). Kilmer puts a touch of this elegance in his performance which I liked. But on the flip-side, plays him as fearless, as the real Holliday (dying from TB) was. Ironically true that he died in a bed with his boots off rather than in a hail of bullets or in s gambling dispute. Elliott is a wise casting choice, Western's are his forte, and he brings a polished performance. Russell is great as Earp, not to mention handsome. Paxton, I could take or leave. The locations and sets are good, and the movie doesn't keep you bored for a minute. A great and entertaining flick!",8,6,9,1 February 2009
The Emperor's New Groove," Awesome fun!!
","I'm not the biggest Disney fan in the world. I enjoy Disney classics 'Dumbo', 'Lady and the Tramp', 'Cinderella' and 'Snow White.' To Live action classics 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' 'Mary Poppins'. But of their movies in the past 20 years the only ones that come to mind were 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Aladdin'. I am generally disheartened by all the singing and dancing, sappy romance stories, talking objects, etc. Emperor's New Groove is the exception.I can't believe so many people bag on this movie!! It's fun, fresh and there's maybe 2 musical numbers in the whole thing, and even they're short. David Spade and John Goodman voice the two main roles, a spoiled brat emperor turned Llama, and the good hearted peasant who helps him. Supported by some amazing voice work from Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton, this movie succeeds in being the Disney 'Anti Disney.' Preferring to fill it's running time with tongue in cheek humor, funny gags, and humor to keep both the adults and kiddies amused!!I was pleasantly surprised and highly recommend the watch! A wonderful change in pace from the usual repeat romance and dance numbers.",10,0,1,30 November 2008
Thor: The Dark World," a pretty decent addition....
","Well, I liked it better than I did the first Thor (my problems with the first being that I didn't find the time allowed for redemption believable, and there was a lot of unnecessary CGI.) And i'm a nerd, especially a big Marvel nerd.While it's true that this movie had a little more going on, my main issue was with how rushed the scenes that were supposed to be emotional, poignant and devastating were.The death of Frigga, the 'death' of Loki, and the scene where Thor visits Loki are great examples of this. Now, I've read contradictory things on the IMDb message boards with some blaming the director, others, the editors. I don't know who the blame lies with, but not allowing the full emotional impact of this scene to ride out so everyone- in movie and audience could be allowed to feel this was a mistake. Yeah I know that Frigga's tribute is a grand Viking funeral, but this comes after those personal to her are gathered around her. As far as the 'death' of Loki is concerned, I just believe extending that scene an extra minute would have been more powerful, especially seeing as he is a major and popular character. The elves looked menacing, and like a force to be reckoned with, sadly there's no dimension to them or any dimension to Malekith. They're the bad guys, and we're given little more to their motivation other than wanting the universe in darkness. Hardly any time is spent on them.I'm still not sold on Natalie Portman as I still think her part could've been played by anybody, but at least she's less frumpy here, and boy, does she know how to slap people in the face, oh boy does she ever. A little too convenient that she find herself the one infected by the Aether out of a planet full of billions, but I guess for the sake of the story i'll buy it.Why does Selvig have no pants? And why is he 'crazy'? What drove him to these things, what's the point of it.(What happened to Odin ultimately? Was he killed? was he sent into suspended animation? cast off to a different planet/dimension completely?) Why wouldn't they be gods and immortal? Why would Odin say that? You mean to tell me they can fly, conjure magic, get beaten to a merciless pulp by the Hulk, stabbed, shot with fire balls/flames, hit by cars, endure apparent space travel by falling into the void, and battle with countless entities including but not limited to frost giants, but a mere impaling into the chest would be enough to kill them? or they would simply die after approx. 5,000 years? I felt that line was out of place and unnecessary. Sometimes the CGI was a little overwhelming, and some 'landscapes' were awful dark and drab, almost to the point of the darkness interfering with me seeing/understand what was happening.Some of the dialog at times I found corny.Now the great: LOKI. so glad he's a big part of this movie too. I highly anticipated seeing what had become of him post Avengers. Every second he's on screen he steals the show. Loki consistently remains the only one in this series with any dimension, development or understandable motivation. Hiddleston is a great actor and has done an outstanding job, The scenes between him and Thor make the movie.Thor: he's grown on me. It took me a while to warm up to Thor, something that didn't start happening for me until the Avengers. Thankfully he's starting to have a personality, and thinking wisely. And yes, his physique is something to behold! Sif and The Warriors Three: They were great, glad we had the opportunity to see them in action again. It will be interesting to see what happens with Sif.There were lots of little moments sprinkled throughout this film, clever little happenings (ie: Thor hangs the hammer up on the coat hook, the subway, the Captain America cameo.)The end scene was great...people cheered in my showing (including myself), and left for a pretty good Asgard cliffhanger. Also, thank you Del Toro, now i'm psyched for a 'Guardians of the Galaxy' movie. Overall not a bad addition, and yes, I'll be buying on Blu-Ray. PS- Studios, yes, give Loki his own movie. But only if you do it right, don't change the character for monetary reasons, and don't take him out of character, you can find some decent script writers who understand what this is all about.",7,0,3,14 November 2013
