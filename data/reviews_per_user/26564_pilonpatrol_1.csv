Spartacus," My Pick For #1 Movie Ever
","I know it is probably not going to make me very popular here on IMDb where everyone seems to be either a fan of Shawshank Redemption or Citizen Kane or they are all about Star Wars or Lord of the Rings..... well I like all of those movies too but for whatever reason my all time favorite is and always has been and always will be Spartacus! Maybe it is because it is the first movie I remember watching as a kid and I just loved all the action and especially the climactic scene at the end where Spartacus is forced to fight his own friend.... whatever the reason is I always really loved watching this movie and still do. I can't wait to share it with my kids whenever they are old enough for a kind of violent movie like this.Directed by Stanley Kubrick you know it has to be good, and I think this is his best movie that he ever made.1960, rated R but probably PG-13 by today's standards.",10,5,11,12 January 2014
