Black Swan," Boring
","No real spoilers here but just in case I'm checking the box. Possibly a spoiler for a DIFFERENT movie.I don't know where all these great reviews come from. We have a poor mentally disturbed girl struggling with her sanity while she tries to dance ballet as the white swan (and the black swan).I am a 58 year old male professional so it's not like this is coming from a 13 year old (who DEFINITELY would not like it!). She's having mental problems, so what? The excitement and suspense was not there. At least, in movies like Single White Female, someone gets killed with a high heel to the eye! Does anyone get killed with a high heel to they eye in this movie? No! (That's my one plot hole for Single White Female, I don't think it's possible to kill someone with a high heal.. no way it would reach the brain..., but anyway..)The relationship with her mother - couldn't care less... I guess the ending was pretty good. That was the only part even slightly interesting.I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and it never did, until the very end.",4,5,8,4 December 2016
Pan's Labyrinth," Completely wonderful movie
","Just some background: I'm a 57 year old man, and although I like science fiction, I generally do not like fantasy movies. This movie seemed like a fantasy, my expectations were low, but since everyone rated it so highly I thought I'd give it a chance.Boy was I in for a surprise. This movie was incredible in every way. The 'fantasy' parts really were just a sideshow to the true horror that was going on in the Spanish civil war.It was sad, it was touching, it was horrible, it was engrossing, there was hate, cruelty, and revenge.The character of Mercedes played by Maribel Verdú was my favorite. A tough and brave woman in every way, yet kind as well.My main point is, don't think this is just one of those kiddy fantasy movies. So, it's not a fantasy movie, like, for example, the Neverending Story. Yes there are fantasy and magical parts woven in, part of the mind of the little girl (or is it real?).When I see a movie and I'm thinking about it for several days afterwards, I know it was a good one. I whole heartedly recommend it.",9,1,5,19 March 2015
Ex Machina," Really fun movie!!!
","If you're not a science fiction fan or interesting in programming, MAYBE this movie MIGHT not be for you. Not sure. I'm a programmer so I was totally into it.The thing I liked about it is, it caught my attention and I had my eyes glued to the screen the whole time. A little bit of a mystery, but I did guess some things ahead of time (it was pretty obvious really).I never thought I would like a movie about an AI-machine girl, and I would have skipped it, but I happened to see the trailer and it intrigued me.A lot of people are finding 'plot holes', I think there are explanations for most if not all of them. Watch the ending, the very ending scene carefully...I search and search and search for good movies, and on most of them, when it's done I feel like I wasted my time. So I spend 2 hours searching for a 90 minute 'good movie', and when I find a REALLY good one I'm so happy! I didn't waste my 108 minutes! Don't read any spoiler reviews before you watch this, don't read any message threads, it will ruin the suspense.Some people are complaining it's too shallow of a treatment of AI, it should be explored, more deeply, I say, who cares! It was fun to watch.",7,0,1,11 July 2015
Pi," Boring, tedious, pretentious, cliché, complete waste of time
","How do movies like this get a 7.5 rating and cause me to waste 84 minutes of my time? I'm not a mathematician but I know a little about science, I already know about the Fibonacci sequence and how it appears in nature, PI, etc. They just threw a bunch of mathematical clichés and threw it all together into a stupid, irritating mess that made no sense.I was waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen, nothing ever did. The ending was completely ridiculous and unbelievable.What I want to know is how does a movie like this get a 7.5 on IMDb? OK I started out giving it a 1, but in retrospect, since I'm still thinking about it, I'll up it to a 3.Unless you really like artsy movies I'd skip it...",3,3,6,13 June 2015
Sinister," Not worth the time
","You can read the other reviews for more of a synopsis, I'll leave that out, other than to say it's kind of a mix of a supernatural thriller and one of those 'found footage' movies.The jump scares didn't scare me much. The story was flat, and they didn't make me care about the characters. Like most supernatural horror movies, the supernatural premise was just dumb. Well, for example, I liked Occulus, whose premise was that this mirror was haunted by a spirit. OK, it was dumb, but other parts of the movie made it fun to watch. But with Sinister, the supernatural premise was also dumb, but there was nothing else cool about it to make it fun to watch.So, this movie has a dumb premise AND it was no fun to watch. If you want to be horrified by awful 'found footage' murder scenes you might like it.I was just waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen, and it never did. Near the end I figured out the supernatural basis of everything, and it was a real letdown.A lot of scenes make no sense, I'm sure someone else will lay them out, I can't do it since I didn't check the 'spoilers' check box.Overall I got to the end and felt like I just wasted my time...",3,2,3,21 March 2015
Trainspotting," It's on my 'mandatory' list
","Mandatory means you have GOT to see this movie! Now, I wanted my 17-year old son to see it and his mother said 'no no!', she thinks it's going to make him want to take drugs. Trust me, after watching this movie you'll NEVER get the idea of trying heroin. (Not that you would anyway!).I watched it twice, and I rarely do that. Totally engrossing, you won't look away from beginning to end. So many movies, after it's over I feel like I wasted my time. With this one, it was on my mind for days afterwards.There are funny parts, horrifying parts, good drama. You won't see anything blowing up in this movie if that's what you like...Robert Carlyle as 'Begbie' was awesome, I loved him (and hated him... not a nice guy...). It was like the Kramer portrait in Seinfeld: 'He's a loathsome, offensive brute. Yet I can't look away!'.",9,0,1,22 May 2015
