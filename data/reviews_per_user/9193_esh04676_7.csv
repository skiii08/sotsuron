"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," full of sound and fury signifying nutty
","I had been told that this movie was very funny and that I should surely view it. I was skeptical, but put it on my CD player anyway. What a lot of noise and silliness! So much might be done with the subject matter--drag queens, homosexuals, transvestites trying to make their way in the world--but this film settles for a superficial view of how a minority group and society at large relate to each other. At this point I cannot tell one actor from another, but I thought the depiction of the character who is married and has a child was best. Although the trio ran into some bad situations with local people at times, on the whole they got off better than would probably have been the case if they had toured the American west a hundred years ago--or even today. On the other hand Oscar Wilde toured that region with a lily in his hand!",Null,0,4,7 October 2004
Being John Malkovich," A major disappointment
","John Malkovich being Lewis Carroll!. Remember through the looking glass and down the rabbit hole? And all the strange situations Alice got into, like rooms with low ceilings? But this film lacks the charm of the literary classic written in the 19th century. In fact, it is a deplorable mess. I am a Malkovich fan. He has done some of the finest work in theatre and film of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. But this is a major misstep. The puppets (really marionettes) with all their actions being controlled by someone else pulling the strings are supposed to be some sort of analogy for what happens to the real people--with someone else yanking them around. But I wish we could have seen more of them--the marionettes, that is. And I thought the pet orangutan was good also.",4,1,2,4 October 2004
The Usual Suspects," Great to look at and fine performances to admire, but no!
","I was constantly impressed by the camera work in this film. Many shots are of breathtaking beauty. The cinematographer always gives us unusual angles. Probably the fact that I noticed so much of this visual stuff is a negative comment about my reaction to other elements of the movie. I got tired of so many people being shot to death and confess that the interweaving of past and present as Kevin Spacey tells the story was hard for me to follow sometimes. However, all actors were superb, with Spacey being particularly riveting. Much of the time he reminded me of that old-time specialist in villainy- Peter Lorre. Despite these favorable comments, I am happy to join with those who think The Usual Suspects has been overrated and who are baffled about its number 18 position on the 250 list,",Null,0,1,22 October 2004
Meet the Fockers," box office gross is high for this gross film
","I am not a prude. I enjoy raunchiness, but some skill, a light touch, is required. If you are amused by a sex therapist talking shop, watching a weird little dog hump everything in sight, the reactions at the dinner table when a foreskin lands in a plate of soup. or seeing a baby in a high chair mouth expletives then this is the show for you. An evidently for millions of movie goers who have made Meet the Fockers one of 2004's top moneymakers. Too bad, it will encourage all the people involved in making this appalling movie. I would expect the spectacularly untalented Ben Stiller to willingly participate in this project, but would like to know how such top[ veterans as Streisand. De Niro, Hoffman, and Danner got involved.",1,3,4,28 May 2005
Trainspotting," Great direction, acting, photography, music but grim story
","First I should say that I saw this on a new DVD called a Collectors' edition (or something similar). Included was an option for captions, which helped a lot with the Scottish accents. This is a very grim story lightened at times with comic dialogue and situations, but the viewer carries away only a feeling of horror. Drug addiction and what it does to the lives of all it touches, including infants, is the overriding theme. At the same time one also feels the horror of day-to-day life for these young men with little faith in themselves and despair at the dead end of their young lives. Ewan McGregor is particularly fine as Renton, the man who seems to be succeeding at making a life for himself without drugs, but this is up to question at the end of the film. The rest of the cast demonstrated great skill at ensemble playing, a tribute to the director.",6,0,2,28 September 2004
Donnie Darko," An easily disliked film
","Extra material on DVD I rented included a number of scenes that were cut from the final release. I think a lot more could have been cut. Drew Barrymore does not add luster to the name of a distinguished American theatrical family by her association with this movie. Jake Gylenhaal performs very well, but he may have been distressed with the finished product. His film parents are overgrown juveniles, particularly his father who is first seen playfully threatening his wife with some sort of electric pruning instrument. This is the father of teenagers! Later on he is seen as unable to remember the name of the psychiatrist treating his son for rather severe mental health problems. A detached parent. And mother seems to be rather vaguely distracted as she wanders about with a half smile on her face and a drink in her hand. And then there are the people at Donnie's school, including an inept principal and an incredibly stupid teacher. No wonder Donnie takes refuge in his dark visions. The problems of a young man trying to cope with his own terrifying inner world of demons should have been handled with more sympathy and less reliance on special effects.This is an unlikable picture about unlikable people.",Null,0,2,22 November 2004
Dodgeball," funny and heartwarming triumph of the underdog
","Fast-paced and filled with slapstick moments, Dodgeball is one of the more delightful films I have seen in a long time. Thurber, Vaughan, Stiller and all the rest of the outstanding team deserve lots of credit. The overall story is well presented, and the dialog sparkles. There are plenty of raunchy innuendos--and some not so innuendo! I viewed this movie also as a satire on big- money big-time sports in America and the do-or-die attitude of many of its stars who often play with injuries and in great pain in order to satisfy terms of their contracts with wealthy team owners.This all seems to be neatly summed up at the very end of the movie with Pete LeFleur's surprise--not to be revealed here.",10,1,2,16 February 2005
