Casablanca," What a Classic
","Casablanca is one unforgettable film. This is a film that people talk about and love. Even those who have not seen this film yet still know and have heard about it.Casablanca is a film about love and war. This film was created just before world war II. During it there are some between the lines showing that Germany will lose the war, before they even knew who would win and lose. Which I personally believe to be as something very magnificent and special.The acting in Casablanca was one to be unforgettable. Humphrey Bogart plays Richard 'Rick' Blaine and actress Ingrid Bergman plays Lisa Lund. Together they play wonderful roles.The cinematography is something amazing. some of the best for its time. The lighting and camera long takes and zooming is awesome. Can't be better. It's no wonder this film is so famous even today.A total recommendation to friends and family. Even could be a good date night movie.",8,0,1,11 March 2010
Lifeboat," I'm On a Boat!
","This is quite a different film then I expected. When I heard of the movie Lifeboat I thought, maybe some kind of Gilligan Island type movie, but more on the dramatic side. I guess I was wrong.Of course this doesn't stop the movie from being a well done Alfred Hitchcock movie. Again to my surprise this was done by Hitchcock. I hardly saw any Hitchcock movies, and did not know a lot about his films. But now after watching some of his films including Lifeboat, I have come to love his work.Lifeboat is a full on dramatic film. To think about it, this was probably a low budget film since it only takes place in one place, the middle of the sea. The camera footage was nice, angling on important characters and even in the beginning Hitchcock used his camera angle of looking through a characters eyes, something I have come to notice Hitchcock uses in his films.In a film like this, it gives you the chance to understand the characters even better, since it is confined in a small place. Learning their personal lives and their mental states. Also you get a better picture of all the drama that is going on. All the actors and actresses did a great job.Throughout the film it gets you wondering, 'what would you do to survive?' I have to say Alfred Hitchcock yet again made an outstanding movie a very good classic to watch at least once.Not to give anything away...but I was kind of disappointed about the ending.",6,3,4,11 March 2010
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane = Citizen Awesome.
","The first couple minutes of this movie we are shown the death of Kane, and soon it jumps to be some documentary of his life, with a narrator telling us. This is a great way to start out a film, especially one that has mystery.After this introduction we are introduced to the main character inspector Leland who is determined to figure out the meaning of 'Rosebud'. Joseph Cotton plays a great inspector making the film watcher think they too are trying to figure out the meaning.The filming is one of the best I have seen in ages. So many different angles and long takes really makes the realism of this film come to be. With having a lot of long takes it takes a lot of practice and patience, and all the actors and actresses were marvelous to pull it off working with one another.",8,0,1,8 March 2010
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Dr. Straaaangelove
","Dr Strangelove was an alright movie. I have to say it ended up being more of a comedy then I expected.This film was created in black and white. The quality and and visual effects was very modern for its time, the air plane shots, which now look corny, but back then it was the best money could probably buy. The filming quality such as camera angles, and scene running times were all greatly put together. making that visual effect all the more better.The directors and writers use of making a serious subject about bombs and war, is somewhat brilliant. The actors all pulled off their roles making a wonderful cast, showing humor in almost every scene.Dr Strangelove is an alright movie. Not the greatest in my dictionary but definitely not the worst.",7,0,1,2 May 2010
Fargo," Fargo!
","The Coen Brothers, who are the directors and writers of Fargo did a swell of a job! Both of the Coen Brothers Joel and Ethan were the directors of this film, even though it wasn't credited that way.The film itself was nicely paced and smooth flowing, making the writing of the script good. I had the opinion though that there were some extra scenes that did not really have any part to the main bases story line. The way the script was plotted it always had you wondering what would happen next in the line of bad happenings.The camera angles, setting, and lighting had all to do with making Fargo even better. With 180 degree shots, panning, zooming, really caught the settle moments that really triggered emotions. The film was shot in Minnesota, during the winter time, giving all the scenes a low key lighting, or natural light.Every little thing about this film was unique, confirming it to be a classic film, and memorable for its time.",7,0,0,29 April 2010
The Graduate," Dustin Hoffman = Benjamin
","This movie was excellent. There were so many directorial techniques. It had dramatic long takes, and zooming on the important characters. Some parts it had a montage of scenes. This movie showed the most match cuts I have seen in any movie that I have noticed. This makes the movie seem so much more interesting and really puts the watcher in the mood of the scenes. The Graduate was filmed after the Hayes code, so the writers now had more of a freedom of having what they wanted in their films. Subjects such as sex, drugs, and more realistic drama.Dustin Hoffman did an outstanding job at playing Benjamin. He showed great confused looks, love, and other emotions. This indeed is a classic film, that has scenes people often still talk about. which I never knew till I finally watched this film.",8,0,0,13 April 2010
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction '94
","Quentin Tarantino has done it again! He has yet again made another fantastic movie. Pulp Fiction has everything in it to make it awesome. From the directing to the acting to the plot line and everything in between. Pulp Fiction has some of the best actors and actresses money can buy. Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, and Uma Thurman, are just some of the huge cast; together they make a great team to make this film what it is today. The main reason to why I personally think this film is amazing is the way it was directed by Tarantino. This isn't just a regular film, where the story line starts from the beginning to ending. Pulp Fiction is a jumbled up mess, as if someone took the script and switched the pages. But that is what makes this film unique and memorable. It takes a couple times to watch the film, or just once, while really paying attention, to really understand what is going on, with all the subplots and characters. Filled with comedy, drama, and memorable quotes, and characters is just fantastic. A must see movie for any film lover.",8,1,2,10 May 2010
Psycho," No Matter How Old, It's Still a Masterpiece!!
","A great start with the introduction credits cool music and dashing movement. Starts off with a slow long take overlooking the city carefully zooming in on the subject and story line. Over the years I have been told about this movie, how well done it is, how great it is, but I have never seen this film until now. This was such an amazing movie from start to finish, a masterpiece. No matter how old it is, or how many times people have talked about it that one famous shower scene is so suspenseful and scary. Hitchcock is pretty much one of the greatest directors of his time. His use of long takes draws the viewer even deeper into the film. The different angle shots and subtle zoom ins makes even more suspense and horror. (spoiler) Actress Vera Miles who plays Lila Crane did an outstanding job, even though she is in only about half the movie. I was very surprised to see that the main character of the film was murdered in the middle, probably the first or second film I ever saw to have that happen. (End Spoiler)The suspicious man Bates, owner of the motel (Anthony Perkins) sure does pull off that creepy image. Making just about every scene suspenseful.I just ended up loving this movie so much. Alfred Hitchcock again blew me away with his outstanding directing and film making. If you haven't seen this movie yet you should.",10,0,1,29 March 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One of Nicholson's Finest!!
","One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is one of the finest movies I have seen in a while. The story line, acting and camera editing all had an important part in making this film a well renowned masterpiece of its time.One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest had such a large amazing cast consisting of Danny DeVito, Jack Nicholson, and even Christopher Lloyd who all did an outstanding job at pulling off the realism of the film.The setting was simple, not very many different scenes other then the insane asylum and there outdoor adventure that takes part in some of the film. What the director had used made it all the more amazing.Low key lighting was mainly used in this film. The music of this movie really played a big part as well, giving the more dramatic effect to what's going to happen next. Throughout the film there wasn't much dialog that was important, one can understand more on the actions of the actors rather then words, since of course the film took place with the mentally insane.The writers mixing drama with comedy to get both sides of the aspect.",9,1,2,30 April 2010
