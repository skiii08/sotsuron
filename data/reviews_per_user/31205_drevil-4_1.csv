The Blair Witch Project," One of the best films of the summer....
","This is probably the best movie that I have seen this summer, and I have seen many movies this summer.  My favorite part of the movie is never seeing anything, as that lets your imagination run wild with you.  I thought that the acting in The Blair Witch Project was top-notch, especially Heather Donahue's confession scene.  The little use of blood and gore, the acting and just the fact that it cost and estimated $50,000 makes this movie well worth $4.50.  I'd like to see it once again, just to understand it better, after reading so many things about it and everything.  The only people that can't enjoy a movie like The Blair Witch Project are the people that have to have things handed to them on a silver platter, or that have no imagination. It was just an all-around good movie, and I highly recommend it.",10,1,2,9 August 1999
