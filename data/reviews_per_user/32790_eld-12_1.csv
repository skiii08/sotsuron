","What a disappointment, just two point for Tom Hardy, as he truly IS Leo Demidov, I had him in mind when I read the book. But now to the movie itself: First of all, they tore the gripping story of the book apart and succeeded in emphasizing unimportant parts of the book while the real interesting part like Leos change from an Apparatschik to a human being with a conscience was totally left aside. They spend probably vast sums of money filming a totally useless war scene in Berlin where Leo in fact never was as he as in a special unit defending his country in the war, it was gruesome, what a waste. Anyway, read the book, be thrilled by the story, be touched by Leos inner fights, and imagine just Tom Hardy.By the way, Noomie Rapace looked like Leos frigid mother, there was never a hint that they finally found each other and gave their new love a chance, she is just an old hag what a terrible cast.Wassily also was a total miscast....the character was not developed at all, just a flat villain.This movie would have need a narrator I guess in order to cover all the shades of the story, just plain acting did not do the job.Do not waste your time, read the book (the books actually, because there are three of them with Leo).",2,5,11,23 October 2015
