Alien 3," A fly on the wall in the Fox studios...
","20th Century Fox studios, circa 1990:Executive 1: `Hey I've got a great idea for Alien 3!'Executive 2: `Great! Let's hear it!'Executive 1: `Well, you know that Alien had one alien, and then Aliens had lot'sÂ…'Executive 2: `Uh huh. So you're saying that logically we should have...'Executive 1: `That's right! One alien!'Executive 2: `Hmm. I don't know. The fans won't like that, there'll be no story development.'Executive 1: `Yeah. But think of the budget!'Executive 2: ` HOORAY!! LET'S DO IT!'I must have watched Princess Bride about four times now and often daydream about being able to play the role of Inigo Montoya. Although in my dreams it won't be to avenge the death of my father, I'll be inside Fox studios shouting:`My name is Inigo Montoya! You killed the Alien Trilogy! Prepare to die!'",1,296,312,10 October 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Unrealistic
","I see that many people here have praised ET to the heavens, and maybe rightly so, but I'm particularly cynical when we have films that contain two of the most dangerous groups in society: children and aliens.Now is it just me, or are kids really nasty little things? If so, then why is it that it's always kids that discover kindly aliens, monsters, robots or beings of pure energy, that adults always want to destroy or at least slice open? Just once I'd like to see an adult find a nice, kind caring monster and then have to protect it from a hoard of marauding children. Don't believe that would happen? Try dressing up as a Teletubbie and spend a day shopping at a mall, then you'll see.Also, I'm not sure what kind of advanced alien species ET was from, but whoever was flying that ship was a bit of a moron and in serious trouble. Let's face it, in today's litigious society, where you can get sued for serving hot coffee, imagine the kind of lawsuit ET would have had against the tour firm he was travelling with! Plus, why did he have to call home, wouldn't his wife, girlfriend (or boyfriend) have raised the alarm when he didn't come back? But that kind of trouble pales in comparison to the amount of explaining he'd have to do:`I'm sorry honey, you see I got lost and the guys left without me and I couldn't find a phone anywhere. So there I am, naked, hanging out with these kids when. Honey? Honey?'",Null,4,6,7 October 2002
Dawn of the Dead," This movie was so good I forgot I was videoing it
","This is the first time I've been back to the cinema in Aylesbury since my date with that girl from the Internet (see my Silence of the Lambs' review) but everyone was really cool about it. Richie showed them his ID and told them it was part of my rehabilitation, and the manager let us in.
We went to see Dawn of the Dead' which had sequel written all over it in my opinion. I was cool about seeing it though, but told Richie that I'd seen the first one and remembered that it was rubbish (see my Dead Poets Society' review). Richie said he didn't really want to watch it either, but knew a few people who did.Because the seat numbers kept changing I couldn't work out where we had to sit, so Richie sat me down at the front and made a few phone calls whilst I watched the adverts. When they were finished Richie gave me a video camera and told me to focus on the screen, press record and then not move. Richie then tells me he's got to go because there's a mammoth lose in the hospital and to wait here for him, because it's a test.The film was really crazy and scary though, so I had to concentrate hard on not moving. It's about the dead coming back to life and attacking people and in many ways reminded me of Last of the Summer Wine'. But these undead people have a taste for human flesh and so these people have to hide in a shopping centre to escape.I kept thinking that a better place to hide would be at the hospital were Richie works. That's where babies come from and babies are life, so that would scare the dead away. Also the mammoth could trample any undead that got inside.All the people in the film were really nice and friendly and when some of them died it made me feel sad, but the film's colours made me feel happy and kind of drunk. Towards the end some of the ushers came to talk to me but because of the test I couldn't reply, so I pretended not to see them. They got quite angry, but luckily Richie turned up and told them about capturing my fears' and anger transference' so they left us alone.The good news is that I must be making progress because on the way out Richie told me that the ushers are even dumber than you'. That's progress.Movie Rating: B+Rated R for pervasive strong horror violence and gore, language and sexuality.",Null,1,1,26 April 2004
Spice World," This is reason the UK has gun control
","As I recall, just before this film was released, the laws concerning gun ownership in the UK were changed. This meant that literally thousands of automatic pistols and large calibre revolvers were removed from the hands of the general public. Coincidence? I don't think so. The government knew that the combination of Spice World and privately owned combat handguns would result in retaliatory strikes against both the countries film and music industries, by vengeance hungry members or the public. I don't own any guns, but I'd have probably joined in anyway, using a broom or a saucepan to dish out some Spice Girl inspired justice on the people that created this film.In hindsight, this could have saved us from the likes of Atomic Kitten and there would have been a good chance of sorting out Elton John as well. But alas the government foresaw this and here we are, shaking our heads as the British film industry spasms in its continued death throes.`But it's aimed at kids and Spice Girl fans!' you may shout, thinking that such a statement will somehow appease me. But, you'd be wrong, because the idea of letting those mad harridans, drive around the country in a bus, sing songs or say girl power is almost as insane to me as letting Rosie O'Donnell have her own talk show.If I worked in a video store and someone tried to hire out this movie then I'd refuse to let them have it, and possibly punch them for good measure. That also goes for Moonwalker.",2,51,103,4 October 2002
Dead Poets Society," Being different isn't good
","`Why didn't I have a teacher like that when I was at school?' That's what people's repugnant mouths expunge when I mention this film. `Robin Williams managed to reach out to the kids and taught them that being an individual was something worth striving for.'Try that around me, and I'll PUNCH your stupid face in! That's right I'd use violence, and if I were a teacher I would use violence on the kids as well, and possibly some pensioners!  Why? Because it's all very well having a decent teacher who can reach out to the kids', but most children now are some evil, twisted, yuppie spawn who dwell on pain and suffering. Think ET would have been safe if children had found him? Not in this century! They'd probably throw him on some train lines or strap him to the bonnet of a Ferrari and ram raid Toys R Us.I mean, I was actually at school and it was nothing like it was in this film. If we'd found out there was a Dead Poets Society' they'd have been tracked down and duffed over as soon as possible. Heck, if we found out that one of the boys in school had found an alien in his back garden and had somehow become emotionally bonded' to him, we'd have gone around there and beaten them both up.`Don't deviate from the norm!' That's what we'd have shouted, because it is wrong to deviate from the norm. Look at that guy with the beard in Die Hard, the one who says, `Hans, I can help you get this guy.' He deviated from everybody else and died. Although maybe Hans Gruber thought that he was a bulimic Peter Jackson and shot him anyway. I'm not sure.There's this bit in Dead Poets Society' where Robin Williams (who's not dressed as a woman this time) gets all the boys to walk around the playground, and they all fall into step. That's wrong apparently. What's wrong with being normal? I'm normal and people are always calling me a freak' or a pervert', so god knows what it would have been like if I was deranged or different in some way. So I think that Dead Poets Society' is a bad film because it teaches children that being different is good, and is probably responsible for people like Hannibal Lecter, who thought that rather than eating normal food he'd be different and eat people instead. That's not normal and is also wrong.",Null,3,8,12 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Historically Inaccurate
","I've done my historical research and none of the stuff in this film actually happened. I mean 'The Patriot' and 'Braveheart' took liberties, but this is outrageous! Firstly, I'm not sure where this 'Middle Earth' was (I'm guessing around the Leeds / Manchester area) and I assume that by 'The Shire' they're referring to Buckinghamshire. Well I used to live in Buckinghamshire Peter Jackson, and I can tell you it's nothing like what you show in the film. Next time you start slagging off a large English county I suggest that you do some proper research next time and actually visit the place! You'd be surprised to learn that less than HALF of people in Buckinghamshire are inbred and only 1 in 5 of them have extensively hairy feet.If that's not bad enough Jackson then starts insulting dwarfs and Welsh people. Apparently everybody in Wales is a dwarf. Well if I was a short I would be horrified to be associated with the Welsh, even a Welshman like Colin Farrell (who's very talented). AND to make matters worse, he then goes on to LIE that the Welsh live in huge underground caverns. Just were does he get all this from? Is he on drugs? Anyway, basically somebody Buckinghamshire finds this ring and goes back to a medieval version of Aylesbury (thankfully without the Aylesbury Vale District Council and their stupid 'must wear trousers' laws). I wasn't really paying attention, but apparently this ring is part of a set, like the kind you see in the Sunday Mirror Magazine. Well this guy call Sauron (I say guy, but actually he's just a huge eye! What's that about Jackson you mad Kiwi hack?! Where's Sauron from eh? Slough?) has nearly got the whole set of these rings and just needs the last one, then he can get the collectors display case or something. But apparently people from Buckinghamshire are all thieves now, so a group of these stunted drunkards run off with it, accompanied by Jesus (and he looks really old in this) and that gay guy in the tight shorts from GI Jane. What were they thinking? I could have told them things were going to go bad! Next thing they meet up with this blonde chick with a bow, Sean bean and a Welshman who all join up to throw the ring in a Volcano. A volcano? In England? Oh I'm sorry Peter Jackson but there are no volcanoes in England, not even in Bedford, so that's another part of your story proved to be rubbish. Do more research! Naturally Sauron sends these medieval hells angels after his last ring as quite rightly he wants it back and Jesus goes and sees another Jesus (don't even get me started on this one) who turns out to be a bad Jesus! Jackson, exactly what happened in your head? Are you clinically insane?Erm I think then that the bad Jesus made some cockneys out of mud and then everyone went to Wales (where everyone was dead) and a burning giant with wings fell down a hole. Duh! Giants don't have wings! The giant then kills Jesus and things start to go bad, especially when all these cockneys (who do actually look like cockneys) turn up and kill Sean Bean and kidnap some of the guys from Bucks. It's a good job I drank a bottle of cough syrup at this point because I was getting really angry, the angriest I've been since the flagrant false advertising of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' (the only time I've been forcibly removed from a cinema). When I awoke I was in the Royal Bucks Hospital after apparently going berserk and shouting 'MY PRECIOUS. WANT'S IT SHE DOES!!' Well I'm sorry Aylesbury Crown Court but if running around the Civic Centre with no trousers on attacking female members of staff is 'berserk' then I hate to what would happen if something really serious happened.If you want to watch a proper historical film then I'd recommend 'Krull', because it has a flying clavicle in it! But if your doing research for a piece of GCSE History course work, regarding the corn laws then definitely give 'Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring' a miss.",1,2,7,20 November 2003
Cold Mountain," Nicole is a very rude person
","`Ooh. Nicole Kidman's really nice. Ooh. She's such a nice person.' That's what I hear people say about Nicole Kidman, well have I got news for you? Nicole Kidman is rude and stupid! There how do you like that? How do I know she's like this? Well I've written her 5 (THAT'S RIGHT! FIVE!) letters asking her to go out with me and got NO response. Here's my 5th and final letter to Hollywood's rudest actress:
Dear Nicole Kidman,I guess you didn't get my last 4 letters inviting you over for tea at my mum's house so if you get this one I'd probably complain to your postman. At the moment I'm only asking you over for tea as I have to adhere to a strict police curfew, it's not as if I'm asking you to marry me though. Not yet anyway.You'll be pleased to hear that I don't look like your ex husband Tom Cruise and am above average height. My friend Dave said that Tom looked like me in this film called Vanilla Sky' but don't worry, it was because he'd been hideously mangled in a car crash! I'm above average height in Japan and parts of China, not that I'd go to China, as I hate the place. But not as much as I hate Australia though, with all those horrible Australians and their stupid don't feed koalas drugs' laws. Gah! I really like Americans though, like you and Naomi Watts. If you could arrange it I would consider sleeping with both of you at the same time, but let's just wait until after our first date okay? Obviously don't mention any of that in front of my mum.Anyway, I just wanted to finish by saying that I've loved you with all my heart ever since I saw you in the film Days of Thunder' last week. My heart yearns to be with you as every fibre of my being cries in sorrow that we are not together.I've also sent a similar letter to Famke Janssen, but I'll be giving you first refusal so make sure that you respond quickly so I can let her down gently.All my boundless love
Neon
Do I get a response? Of course not! But I'm not that bothered as I've gone off her recently. As for Cold Mountain', well it's okay.",Null,1,2,13 April 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Another moviegoer cheated by the title
","If you ask for a hamburger in a fast food restaurant, they you get given a hamburger. Why? Because that's what is says on the menu, and if they gave you an omelette you could quite rightly complain as it would be false advertising.Then why do moviemakers continue to get away with such films as Armageddon (the world doesn't end), My Beautiful Laundrette (it looked quite seedy to me) and now Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Now I know that my movie tastes are simple, but if a movie claims to contain both a Dragon and a Tiger, then that's what you should see. And, yes I know that the dragon was hiding, but you should at least of seen his tail or maybe he could have breathed fire or something. So where was the tiger?
If I were to release a film called `Gwyneth Paltrow and Sandra Bullock Take All Their Clothes Off' and then it turned out to be some martial arts film I would get lynched! But not Ang Lee, oh no, he gets to direct The Hulk. And what do you think the chances of us actually seeing this Hulk are? Well, judging by this film pretty slim. Don't get me wrong, I watched this film twice (cos I started shouting at the screen, got thrown out and thought I might have missed the dragon), so I know what was going on, but even that baffled me. Basically the whole film idea is ripped off of from a pantomime called Peter Pan'.
For those of you who don't know what a Pantomime is, it's a kind of play that we have over here in Britain, mostly at Christmas time. In these pantomimes, men dress as women and vice versa, and in Peter Pan a woman dressed as a man gets pulled across the stage suspended by wires. Sound familiar?Most of the rooftop chase scenes reminded me of pantomimes, so I started shouting out in the cinema `He's behind you!' or replying to the characters arguments with `Oh no you're not!' This guy with a torch then asked me to leave so I shouted `Oh no I won't!' and a dozen ushers grappled me to the floor.In my dragon related film marking system, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon only gets 9 points, this is bearing in mind that both Reign of Fire got 17 points and Pete's Dragon got 18 points for having an accurate title.",5,0,1,4 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Jackson, you and Ang Lee are gonna pay
","APPARENTLY Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring' wasn't a historical film, it was a fantasy film. Thanks to the people who messaged me and told me that, mostly rather rudely, but if it's meant to be a fantasy why base it in middle England, or rather (as Jackson decided when he wrote it) Middle Earth? Duh? If I was going to write a fantasy film I wouldn't put Jesus in it, or an evil Jesus doppelganger, but then nobody reads my scripts do they? Well I say nobody, but that guy from the CIA was interested in my hilarious Whoopee Goldberg vehicle Jihad Act', although I'm not sure that his review of it as `Incitement to Terrorist Activity' was altogether fair.Anyway, because Hollywood won't finance my films I have to go and watch fantasy' movies by that bearded lunatic Peter Jackson. So what does he do in the sequel to Lord of the Rings'? Well, firstly the good Jesus doesn't die (technically correct) when he's pulled into a fiery chasm by a winged giant (there are too many inaccuracies to even start discussing here).But after some cockneys kidnapped some of the stunted thieves from the first film, the Welsh Bloke, the lady with the bow and that guy in the tight shorts from GI Jane (who doesn't wash in this film) chase them on foot for about 300 miles! I can't run 300 yards let alone 300 miles and I've seen what Jackson looks like. I bet he couldn't even run 30 yards! Luckily for them a tree (I'm not making this up) rescues the guys from Bucks and then wanders around aimlessly talking rubbish. Jackson, trees don't walk, talk or have meetings with (wait for it) other trees. Wasn't somebody there when Jackson was writing this stuff to stop this sort of nonsense from happening?Peter Jackson: `and then some trees come to life and save them.'Overseer: `Jackson you bearded spaz! That makes no sense! Write a better story!'If I'd written it, it wouldn't be a tree (which the more I say it the more it makes no sense) that saved them; it'd be Whoopee Goldberg. She'd show them that by thinking outside the box and breaking a few rules that war in Middle Earth could be fun! `C'mon! We can really rock this place!' She'd say as she brandished a battleaxe at a Cave Troll.But Jackson decided (against popular opinion I'm sure) not to put the talented Ms Goldberg in this film, which is its primary reason for its failure. Regardless of his poor casting abilities the thieves from Bucks continue their journey towards a burning hellhole (that I presume is meant to be Slough). This skinny guy with huge eyes turns up because he wants the ring, and quite rightly gets put on a leash. Meanwhile Cockneys attack loads of villages and some other things happen that culminate in a huge battle. To be honest the massive hell-storm of historical inaccuracies that Jackson decided to insist were real just got too much for me at this point, so I will say no more on the subject. You've pushed me too far now Jackson, you and that blatant liar Ang my film has a dragon in it' Lee. And it's not because I'm emotionally unstable' (hear that Derek Palmers?) but because of your ludicrously inaccurate historical' pap and Ang's horrendous false advertising. Why don't you both make a film together called Gandhi' about the life of the leader of the famous Indian revolts? That way you could make sure there'd be no one called Gandhi in it and the British could be replaced by massive blue robots with laser eyes and hands that fired atomic rockets! Then of course JESUS would turn up on a horse (it was an ASS Jackson) being chased by something stupid, like a burning fish with legs and you'd BOTH get Oscars for it! Awwww man I'm getting really angry now.It's no good. I'm too furious to even rate this film! Actually, I'm not rating this film and I'm even going to take a point off my Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' review from the 4th October 2002! That puts it at a humiliating 8 points! That's my lowest award EVER Ang (except for Iron Eagle II)!If you cry yourself to sleep tonight then you got off lightly.",Null,0,1,23 December 2003
Pretty Woman," Retard Gere (see what I did there) is a retard
","Let me start this review with a question (THAT'S RIGHT A QUESTION 'EMPIRE' MAGAZINE!) and one that I think might change the way that you view this film in the future. Let's just say that you're Richard Gere in this film, and you have so much money that you can do anything you want would you:A) Pay Julia Roberts, a women who I believe to be possessed by something similar to that slug monster from 'The Hidden' to be your escort for some business events, or:B) Use your wealth to have either Famke Janssen or Whoopi Goldberg cloned to act as your escort for some business events?The correct answer is B. why the hell would you pay Julia Roberts to act as an escort? For a start she's evil and secondly she's possessed by something unnatural that might jump out of her face at any moment. If you were meeting Bill Gates at a posh dinner party and an evil slug exploded out your 'girlfriends' face do you honestly think he'd do business with you? Duh No!But imagine turning up at a posh dinner party in an exclusive restaurant with Whoopi Goldberg? That'd be great! She'd be like all kooky and funny, making all the posh people look like morons.Lord Windford: 'I say, can you pass the baked beans please Ms Goldberg.'Whoopi Goldberg: 'With a name like Windford, I think you've had enough beans already!'HA! Take THAT the British class system! But I bet you'd expect that the whole place would be all stuffy with dull classical music playing and the clinking of cutlery. WRONG! Because wherever Whoopi goes she gets all the people together and shows them that what they're doing can be fun. 'C'mon! We can really rock this place!' she'll shout as she cranks up the sound system with some kickin' tunes (probably Level 42).Empire magazine apparently isn't taking on any new film reviewers right now, or so they tell me. I bet if Steven Spielberg or Quentin Tarantino wrote to them asking to be film reviewers they'd employ them in a flash. Actually if Dr Stephen Hawking wrote in and asked to be on their staff they'd trample over each other to get him to sign a contract. Did they do that with me? No. Just be honest Empire, you can't handle my cutting edge film reviews and you know I'd make the rest of you're staff look like dullards, even with Dr Stephen Hawking and his theory about science.And if they employed me they wouldn't have to put any ramps for wheel chairs in their buildings because I don't use a wheel chair like Hawking does. Quick question: Has Dr Stephen Hawking had any of his film reviews published by IMDb? Answer: No, he hasn't and I've had loads (except for the 'Erotic Witch Project 2: Book of Seduction' one)! In your face Hawking!Now bearing in mind I've already pointed out this film's MAJOR flaw (that it stars Julia Roberts rather than Famke or Whoopi) I expect you're thinking; 'well, there's really no point in me watching this film' and you'd be right. Don't watch it.",Null,2,6,12 October 2004
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Not a movie to take your date on
","Love Never Dies? Is that the tagline? Who thought that up? Well, I tell you something love does die. I used to love Betty Rubble from the Flintstones, but when I saw the movie it was Rosie O'Donnell! Ewww! I soon fell out of love then, I can tell you.But enough of my failed romances, here's what's wrong with Dracula:Firstly there's this guy who runs around killing loads of people and impaling them on spears so that they can die slowly and painfully. He's called Vlad and has got this girlfriend called Elizabeta. Now I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure that if I ran around impaling people on spears or maybe even just one person, I'd be hard pushed to find a willing cellmate, let alone a girlfriend, but clearly Elizabeta likes bad boys. Well she gets confused and thinks that he's dead so she commits suicide (because someone throws a note through the window saying something like `Hi, how are you? Vlad's dead. Love and Hugs, the enemy.')Vlad is upset and shouts at god, blaming him for Elizabeta's death (Duh! It's not gods fault if your girlfriend's stupid) and becomes damned, so that he can spend eternity looking for his girlfriend. Now, if she's committed suicide then surely she'd have gone to hell and all he had to do was throw himself out of the window and they'd have been reunited. But you see, like his girlfriend, Vlad is a bit thick, and chooses to be damned instead.
Fast forward to Victorian England and a guy called Jonathan, who is pretty dull and boring and doesn't impale anyone or suck their blood. He's engaged to a girl called Mina who looks a lot like Elizabeta, and is probably the re-incarnation of her. Notice that Mina is played by Winona Ryder and not by Rosie O'Donnell, then we'd have seen if love never dies! Anyway, Vlad, comes to England and manages to kill some people and Mina falls in love with him and leaves Jonathan. A bit later Jonathan tries to kill Vlad and SUDDENLY Mina starts getting angry with him! Stop being such a hypocrite woman. Sure, Vlad can go out and kill a few dozen virgins, but as soon as Jonathan starts trying to eradicate blood-sucking monsters, he's in the wrong!Maybe it's just that I'm an old cynic after the Betty Rubble/Rosie O'Donnell incident, but if Mina was my daughter and came home with Jonathan, I'd think that he was a nice guy a bit dull, but he had a good job and an interesting accent. But if she came home with Vlad, I'd be quite displeased, particularly when the killing/impaling started.So go and watch Dracula if you think that love never dies, but if like me, you think that love is like a precious orchid, which needs constant attention and care then take you're date to watch a proper romantic movie, like Porky's or Battlefield Earth.",2,9,16,3 October 2002
Blade Runner," What can be more human than human? Duh?
","There's a place in Milton Keynes called 'Blade Runners' and it's an ice skating rink. I really like going there because the changing rooms don't have doors on them and I sometimes wander in and pretend to be from the Ukraine. Of course I'd only wander into the ladies changing room and stay there pretending to be confused until some of the staff came and led me out. Well, I used to do that. Last time I tried it there actually was a girl from the Ukraine, who I think used to be army special forces or something.Anyway, when I get discharged from hospital the doctors tell me to take it easy for a few days, until the swelling has gone down so I ask my mum to hire out a DVD from the shop for me. But rather than hiring out the film I told her to she decides to ask advice from the old guy Henry who works there. He's had something against me ever since Rufus got stuck down the back of the freezer and destroyed all that ice cream. So Henry being the 'expert' on films that he is tells mum to hire out 'Blade Runner' by Ridley Scott telling her that it's a 'classic'.Thanks mum! That's not insensitive after what I've been put through! All the horrible memories of the unprovoked attack and the police caution came flooding back when I saw the title of the film. Besides, how many times have I told her to not believe anything Henry says? Especially when he starts by saying 'The police came to the shop last night asking about your son' In 'Blade Runner' Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a man who hunts down robots for a job. That sounds easy doesn't it? Well it's not because these 'replicants' look like people, and he has to use an old projector or something to read their minds, somehow. It seems to take AGES so why not do this instead: Rick Deckard: 'Hi. How are you? Would you like a drink of water?' Replicant: 'No thanks, I'm not thirsty.' Rick Deckard: 'That's right! Only humans can get thirsty! Die robot!!' BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! That's much easier than some stupid test and he could kill far more robots that way. His boss would be really pleased I'm sure. I mean, if Rick Deckard sold cars and in one day he sold seven, but there were only four in the shop his boss would be really pleased, just like if there were only four replicants on the loose and Deckard managed to kill eleven.And whilst we're on the subject of robots looking like people, wouldn't it be easier to make them look a little different? Couldn't they, I dunno, look like George Hamilton or something? That way there'd be no need for the test I just made up and anyone who looked like George Hamilton would be shot. Obviously George Hamilton would have to have plastic surgery to look like someone else, maybe George Lucas. That way when people shouted 'Hey George!' he'd know that they were talking to him and look round. If he looked like Bob Hoskins and people shouted 'Hey Bob!' he might get confused.Also, if I brought a robot and it only worked for four years I'd be pretty annoyed. I'll bet they have a program in the future like 'Watchdog' over here in the UK. They'd soon have Tyrell on there going on and on about how he was selling robots that only worked for 4 years. If they had him on 'Watchdog' I bet Nicky Campbell would make insulting comments about Tyrell's glasses because they are kind of stupid looking. Surely though another company would make robots that worked for 10 years or something, or until their hair went out of fashion, and then beat the Tyrell Corporation at their own game. And what's with the whole 'more human than human' thing anyway? That's a moronic motto. How about 'sexy robots that put out'? That'd be a better motto, or maybe 'Tyrell don't smell, are bots are hot and we make 'em like George whether you like it or not!' That's decent marketing and in the form of a rap as well to appeal to kids and gangsta's.After watching this film I can't wait for the future, but I don't think it's a classic, not like the excellent 'Battlefield Earth' or a film I wrote last night. There should have been more emphasis on what pleasure robots like Daryl Hannah get up to and maybe some steamy scenes in a women's changing room. Of course if Henry hadn't offered his 'expert' opinion then those are some of the scenes I could have expected in 'The Erotic Witch Project'.Neonsamurai Film Score: AAB",4,14,41,7 January 2005
Trainspotting," Irvine Welsh Tells Lies
","`Hello. I'm Irvine Welsh and I claim to know all about drugs.' That's what Irvine Welsh would say if you met him, thinking that he was all cool and clever. Well if I met him he'd probably say something different. Oh yes, he'd say something very different indeed. Actually he'd probably call security like most celebrities do, or tell me to put some clothes on. However, I wouldn't listen because I'd denounce him for the fraud that he is. Here's why:In his fantasy film (because that's what it is, a fantasy! Just like Mary Poppins, The Wizard of Oz or The Patriot!), a man called Renton tries to get off drugs by locking himself in a room with some cans of soup, some porno magazines and an old mattress. Oh yeah right! Thanks to stupid Virgin Airways and their overly sensitive cabin staff, I've kind of adopted this Koala. For reasons beyond my control the Koala ate about £9000 worth of crack cocaine on a flight from Australia and somehow didn't die. Well I threw it in my parent's spare room with all the required components (as per that liar Irvine's instructions) and sat back waiting for it to go cold turkey. But guess what? It didn't work!What did happen was my parent's cat (who I hadn't noticed was on the bed) got all jittery and, well, the RSPCA have been onto me again. Technically I did nothing wrong and it was that little Aussie crack-head that should be going to court and not me. But apparently the police around here don't arrest marsupials, or so the community welfare officer told me. Like I believe anything she or Irvine says anymore.In summary, I quite enjoyed some bits in Train Spotting', like the bit at the beginning when Renton's saying, `Buy a car, buy a house, buy some gloves, watch some TV, eat some food, lay down, learn to swim, buy some cheese...' I thought that was quite useful information, but he soon stopped saying that. There was also a bit with a baby that got stuck in a gravity well, but that's all I can think of. The bits with the drugs seem very dated and out of touch with normal people's experience of narcotics, such as mine.As I understand that taking drugs can sometimes be called chasing the dragon' I will use my dragon related marking system and give it only 9 points. That's 9 points less than the excellent Pete's Dragon' but a good 2 points more than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. I would also like to stress that there are NO DRAGONS IN THIS MOVIE. Hear that Ang? That's called honesty.",Null,0,9,18 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Jackson fools everyone, except me.
","Yesterday I'm waiting to get into the cinema to watch the film LotR: Return of the King' and this woman starts screaming that I'm exposing myself.
What's that got to do with this horribly inaccurate travesty of a movie? Well it seems that everybody else just sees what they want to see with these movies and not focus on the truth, like the lady who screamed `PERVERT! PERVERT!' at me as I waited patiently in the queue. Of course one of the ushers tried to get me thrown out as well (apparently they don't let people into the cinema with bottles of cough syrup anymore) and told me to come back fully dressed. Again, a person who just sees what they want to see and to hell with the truth!But I thought that maybe I had just misunderstood the first two films and being an open-minded guy I'd give the last of the trilogy a try. Big mistake!What's the first thing that happens in the film? Well a guy finds a ring and then goes bad'. Jackson, I have REPEATEDLY informed you that your films contain stupid, inaccurate situations that wouldn't ever happen. Rings don't make people go bad. In fact I tried to give Shelley an engagement ring but she refused and then SHE went bad. I still had the plastic ring in my hand, but I remained normal whilst she freaked out and started raving about `I only met you yesterday', `I thought the police arrested you' or `you're a stalker'. She was clearly mad, but guess what? No ring!But I digress; because this huge, firey eyeball decides to wage war on some part of England, all these armies are raised to fight back. Why on earth is this eye on fire? And since when do people take orders from giant flaming eyes? It's just not normal. Oh, sorry. I forgot I was talking about a film made by Peter let's put a bad Jesus in it' Jackson.Jackson: `and the giant burning eye sends its army to war!'Overseer: `Wha? How does it do that Jackson? It's just an eye! How does it talk? And how the hell does a solitary burning eye raise an army? I'm warning you, if things don't improve I'll be hitting you with this stick!'Thankfully the bad Jesus doesn't make an appearance in this film, since his house gets flooded (by walking trees!) and I guess he had to tidy it up or something. But his counterpart, the good Jesus, continues to do things that weren't in the bible and goes to this big white city (Cambridge?) with one of the little guys from Bucks. I've been to Cambridge and it was full of students and girls with stupid scarves who'd be all friendly with Rufus and then call me a monster. Honestly, it was like Free Willy' all over again, but with that coked up Koala getting all the love instead of me! There was NO reference to students, the police or Koalas in this movie.So there's this huge army of cockneys ready to attack Cambridge and guess what? The good guys are outnumbered. So what does Jackson decide to do in an attempt to even the odds? He raises the dead. Jackson, the dead are dead for a reason, and what in god's name did you think you were doing by raising them? And now I think about it how do you actually raise the dead?Jackson: `so the dead come to life and they're green.'Overseer: `Euuuurgh! Jackson you dullard! This is the worst story ever! Why are the dead green and how come you're a director? I wish we'd financed Jihad Act' now, as whoever wrote that is a genius!'Now I'm getting angry again! Movie producers make this film and then sneer at the screenplay for Jihad Act? No wonder the film industry is in so much trouble when genuine talent is overlooked for ill conceived rubbished spewed forth by a man who looks too much like one of his own creations with a wig on. You've done it again Jackson! You've made me so mad that I'm taking ANOTHER point off of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.
So in summary, most people who go and see the film would be the same type of people who'd shout and jeer that I was a pervert and not look beyond their small little worlds. Just watch, it'll get Oscars. Just don't expect me to turn up at the after show party Jackson; I'll be busy.",Null,0,1,12 January 2004
The Truman Show," I'm sick of reality TV. And transvestites.
","If everyone has 15 minutes of fame then Truman Burbank has unfairly taken most of mine. He's on TV 24/7 but I think it's waste of time and I could do a better job. If the BBC gave me a video camera I could make them a much better reality show that'd get top ratings. There's this women only gym near one of the industrial estates and if I climb up some of the builders scaffolding I can film the women getting changed.Do I get a response from the BBC about this idea? Do I hell? I swear that Nicole Kidman must work in their post room or something. People complain that there are not enough women running major companies, but Kidman couldn't even respond to one letter that I sent her. NOT ONE! So if she's typical of most women then it's probably because they don't send back their job application forms! Stand up for yourselves and be counted women! Don't be like Nicole Kidman!Anyway the film stars Jim Carey as the hero of the story who doesn't realize he's being filmed. Some people say that's a bit far fetched, but you'd be surprised how easy it is to film people without them knowing. Truman lives this ideal life, however deep down he's sad because he wants to do so much more. He wants to travel and go places, but he's afraid of water and lives on an island, which is a bit dumb. Not as dumb as the Brody family in the 'Jaws' films though. Oh man, were they stupid? They were like a bearded version of the Brady Bunch, but with a much lower IQ. People watch the Truman show all the time, even when he's sleeping and he's quite a celebrity, ignorant to the fact he's the most famous man on the planet.Luckily they couldn't secretly video me because I do stuff that 'makes baby Jesus cry', according to my mum, who blamed it on the 'Erotic Witch Project'. I don't make Jesus cry THAT much though so there'd still be time to check me out doing cool things, like climbing over my neighbors fence and pretending to be dead. That's always funny! It's really funny when I get up and pretend to be like one of the zombies in 'Dawn of the Dead' and try to break into their house. I normally only do it when the husband is away on business though as he doesn't laugh and scream hysterically like his wife does. She mostly screams rather than laughs though. But they'll be moving house soon, so I guess I'll have to stop doing it. They only moved in 3 months ago, which is a shame, because I thought we were really getting along well and having a laugh. The funniest time was when I hid in the boot of the wife's car. That was really funny!As with filming people secretly in real life, Truman gets suspicious and starts trying to avoid the cameras. He doesn't shriek or scream or call one of the shop assistants over to the changing rooms like people do in real life, but instead tries to outsmart the whole production company, which he does. Obviously that leads to the end of the whole TV series. If I were watching his show I'd be like 'Oh thank god that's over with! That was such a dull program.' and providing that they didn't put snooker on instead I'd be happy.I really don't like snooker it's the world's worst sport.Neonsamurai film rating for snooker: Code Alpha Foxtrot Tango",Null,1,3,25 October 2004
The Matrix," Almost as good as Iron Eagle
","Did this film rock or what?!?!?! Other than 'Iron Eagle' this is probably THE best film ever made! Better than 'Deep Rising' and certainly better than 'Prince of Tides' which it turns out is rubbish.I really hope that what they say in the film about our reality being an illusion is true, because that would totally rock! I can just imagine it, all my convictions and fines disappearing because that was all thought up by some whacked-out X box or something. Actually I really do hope it's real because just look at my name: Neonsamurai. Got that? All right, now read it without the 'nsamurai'. That makes ME 'Neo' or 'The One'. Oh boy am I ever going to kick ass? You wait until the next time I see Derek Palmers! Backflip, punch, head-butt, uppercut! I've already got the cool name, I spend a lot of time on the Internet doing research and when I did have a job I was always late for work. Spooky eh? Plus, can you imagine Morpheus trying to rescue somebody else from the Matrix, such as Dr Stephen Hawking? I can't either. Firstly he hasn't got a cool name like me and secondly I bet he hasn't even watched 'The Matrix' once. I've seen it EIGHT times. You read that right, EIGHT times. Quick question: Hawking vs. me in a fight. Who'd win? Answer: Me! Even if it was a battle of minds, I'd probably still win. Or a game of snap.What with me being 'The One' I'd probably make Famke Janssen my 'Trinity' as I'm pretty sure that in the battery farm where I'm stored, she's got the pod next to me. That's probably why we have such a close affinity with one another. In fact I'm pretty sure that on the other side of me would be a pod with Nicole Kidman in it, except her brain plugs DON'T WORK PROPERLY AND SHE DOESN'T RETURN MY CALLS! Well guess what Nicole, when I'm flying around beating up 'Agents' and dodging bullets don't expect me to come to your rescue if they try and read you mind with a couple of electric cables. You had your chance and you blew it. So long sister, you're baaaaaad news.When I was in 'House of Fraiser' in Milton Keynes last week I decided it was time for me to get out of the Matrix and meet up with Morpheus, or whoever it is flying those hovercraft things around the sewers. Well let me tell you something; if you want to leave the Matrix don't try jumping through mirrors in a department store, particularly if the mirrors are in the ladies changing room, and you're being chased by security guards. When I got out of hospital that night I decided to do a search for 'Morpheus' on the Internet, but got bored and instead did more research on women's bodies.Morpheus, if you're reading this then hurry up and post me a phone to my mum's house as I'm due in court next week on charges of indecent exposure and criminal damage in a department store.",9,1,2,7 January 2005
The Godfather," My last review
","I've never seen the Godfather before but Richie said he was `tired of watching Snooker Legends' and wanted to watch a proper film. I watched it and thought is was good. The colours weren't as nice as the ones in Prince of Tides' but it was a decent film with a beginning, middle and an end.The story is about a mafia family, and how the all American' son gets drawn into being the head of it. This part is played excellently by Al Pacino (Michael Corleone), with my favourite scene being one of the last when he has to avenge the death of his father. It's got to be one of his best performances to date and I can see why Channel 4 viewers voted him the world's greatest actor. Although it's an ensemble piece with a very impressive cast, they are all given a chance to give some great performances, giving each character in the film a real sense of depth.The film is slow, which I think works to its advantage. Francis Ford Coppola tries to keep everything as realistic as possible and that includes the pace at which everything unfolds. It also makes the violence that bit more shocking when it happens.Richie likes this film a lot. He says that the characters in this film are his heroes and that one-day he'll be like Don Corleone. I don't think he meant fat with a funny voice though, but because he hates being a nurse. He also says that this film shows you how important respect is and that I should show him more respect, starting with giving him my PC. I told him that I needed my PC to write my film reviews, but he told me that it could cause a psychotic resurgence', and that my film reviews were pathetic (he had only read my Escape From LA' one though).Richie has also had to sell some of my pink pills to his friends so that he can expand his turf'. I'm not sure what that means; maybe he's getting an allotment or a back yard. Anyway, Richie will be over this weekend to pick up my computer so I guess that this will be my last review.So to summarise:   The Godfather (1972) - Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and Abe Vigoda - Written By Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo - Based on the Novel By Mario Puzo - Directed By Francis Ford Coppola - MPAA Rating: R I rate it a 10/10 a must see film",Null,1,3,26 May 2004
