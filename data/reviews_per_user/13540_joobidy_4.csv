The Ring," Scariest Movie Ever
","From the beginning scene, I knew that this was going to be a great movie. This movie has scenes that totally scared the poo out of me. If you are going to see this movie, be prepared for things to just jump out from nowhere.",Null,0,0,2 December 2002
The Ring," I screamed like a girl, and I am not a girl!
","This is the scariest movie that I have seen since The Shining. The special effects are not that amazing, but it doesn't need any special effects. What scared me the most is when scary things just POP OUT OF NOWHERE. Those scenes totally freak me out. I think that the ending could have been a little better, but if you are looking for a good movie to go to, see this! (Haven't seen Jackass yet)",Null,0,0,12 November 2002
Armageddon," Terrific movie!!!
","I really am surprised on how many people gave this bad reviews. Not only did they give it bad reviews, but they totally ripped it in half. First, the cast is nearly unbeatable. Second, the story is great and does not contain as many 'Yeah right' scenes as its sister movie Deep Impact. I really don't get what the big deal is about this movie.",Null,0,1,23 December 2002
Signs," Not as scary as I thought it would be...
","Let me just say this: THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE. In fact, I went to go see it twice. But as horror movies go, this isn't very good. It has some freaky parts, but it lacks the 'heart-stoppers' of other horrors of its time. Mel Gibson is a terrific part for the main character, but really does not fit in right for a scary movie.",Null,0,2,12 November 2002
