Requiem for a Dream," Okay, if you want the observations of a former IV narcotics addict, here's one.
","Though I am pleased to see that most people have given this film very positive reviews, I had to laugh at some of the negative ones questioning the validity of Aronofsky's presentation of drug addiction, including those alluding to the film being anti-drug 'propaganda'.Hello, all you deep thinkers.  This former IV narcotics addict can verify that 'Requiem for a Dream' comes closer than any film I've ever seen (that's a whole lot of celluloid, folks) in portraying what addiction -- no matter what the chemical -- is really like.  With all due respect to good efforts such as 'Clean and Sober' and 'Trainspotting', none of those films takes us into the inner desperation, insanity (literally), anger, isolation, shame and hopelessness that addiction ultimately becomes, nearly as well as 'Requiem' does.  If you haven't stolen or otherwise degraded yourself repeatedly to get a drug 'one last time', used to overdose levels knowingly without wanting to, used drugs you hate just because they're there and something awful is better than nothing at all, become capable of hurting others you love intentionally when having to choose between them and the drug, lost the ability to function as a friend, worker, family member or citizen, and kept coming back for more because the compulsion and obsession overwhelmed everything you knew or wanted to do, then please do not pretend to be able to say whether this film is an accurate representation of drug addiction.  Thank you.As for technical merit, the acting performances especially by Burstyn and Leto were absolutely brilliant.  I knew Burstyn was that talented, by Leto totally surprised me and gave one of the very best male lead performances of Y2K.  The script was flawless, the camera work inspired, the frequent flash sequences representing the process of getting loaded were cut to the bone. This is an exceedingly important film.  It's been over eleven years since I touched any mood-altering chemical, nor do I crave to use, but this film brought all that pathetic, degrading, relentless, bleak hopelessness right back.  All you nice little suburban dope smokers who think you know better, please keep your pleasant little self-delusions about the harmlessness of drug use to your pleasant little addled brain numbed selves.  This film shows what it's really like in the big time.  It sucks.",10,0,0,7 January 2001
Fight Club," This film is a fine piece of art, not a political statement.
","That is, I've already read reviews trashing it for its supposed support of physical violence, anarchic bombings, and so on.However, this is actually a film -- in this case, a work of art in form of a film -- and not a manifesto!  Starting from the dramatic opening, followed closely by some excellent dry humour (Ikeaworld), the film follows the disintegration of the finely-wrought defenses of a man whose illusions and reality are untenably in conflict.Edward Norton is brilliant as the narrator.  Picking up from his fine performance in 'American History X', he is better still in this role, with the gradual deconstruction of a highly-strung mind expressed with glimpses, gestures, hesitations, mutterings and unpredictable outbursts.  Very convincing, very sympathetic and also very scary.Brad Pitt, who I like to discount as an actor (for good reason, generally) was a great and pleasant surprise in the role of alter ego.  Given the chance to play, he shows a lot in this role and earns respect as an actor, not a pretty face.The dark humour leavens the subject matter sufficiently to make it hard for me to understand how critics such as in Entertainment Weakly (sic) rail at the film for being in favour of violence and mayhem.  For goodness sake -- it's a portrayal of characters, not propaganda.  This film is no more a proposal for violence than 'Silence of the Lambs' promotes cannibalism.I saw this film on consecutive nights and was just as satisfied with its editing, script, cinematography, direction and acting on the second night as on the first.  Rates a 9 out of 10 from me.So far this is turning out to be a fine year for American cinema.  'Eyes Wide Shut' (a satire that most people mistook for a story about orgies), 'American Beauty', 'Bringing Out the Dead' and 'The Fight Club', plus the non-American film 'Besieged' all are worthy of Oscar nominations for Best Film and for Best Director, plus some acting nominations for each.",10,0,2,27 October 1999
The Mummy," 'Indiana Jones lite' (very lite)
","Others have done the hard (tedious?) work of detailing the plot and acting mediocrity.In the opening sequences we are told that the Egyptian guardians of life and the afterworld first of all want to wreak the worst punishment imaginable on Pharaoh's murderer -- but that, holy smokes, if he's ever unearthed and set free he'll gain all the power necessary to destroy all.  Somebody's idea of a consolation prize???The special effects were okay but, hey, when aren't they, these days (at that price, anyway!), which leaves us with a plot full of holes, very average acting, a few nice desert scenes and the sort of toss-off one-liners that are credible coming from a character (and actor -- Harrison Ford) we believe to be tough as nails despite real fear, but not credible from Fraser's character.Not a waste of time if you've got time to kill (I don't) or kids who will believe this movie is scary.Rating = 6 of 10.P. S.  For all you Hollywood types planning to do 'Blade Runner Lite', HANDS OFF!!!",6,0,0,10 May 1999
American Beauty," Oscars all around -- in a perfect world.
","Whaddya know, a fine film which assumes I can think and know how to feel! Phenomenal acting, editing, script and very effective cinematography, plus a story worth telling and credible characters to care about.Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are brilliant yet only slightly outshine Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari.  There is a tenderness to this film which makes its black satire intensely involving -- not the cheap bleakness and cynicism of Tarantino and his equally sophomoric imitators.  The characters in this film, even at their worst (and they do behave badly), are fully human and demand compassion even while making us sick with contempt or when they're just plain pathetic.The cinematography was effective and innovative, especially the scenes-within-scenes (on Bentley's TV/digital video monitor), to give us both detail, gentle irony and multiple perspectives.In a plot with several plausible endings, it was gratifying to be unsure of the precise outcome because, as in real life, so many possibilities existed and were developed.  Spacey can act -- he doesn't have to give us a ham-fisted monologue for us to know his thoughts and feelings.  What a moment of grace for his character Lester when he hears 'It's my first time', and how convincing and understated is his awakening from the tunnel vision of his obsession to the humble truths, his and hers.  I would predict Oscars (certainly there will be nominations) for this film for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, and Best Supporting Actor,  as well as, perhaps, best screenplay and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, except I know the voters for the Academy Awards are mostly village idiots who collect Star Wars trinkets for intellectual stimulation and rarely see half the films they vote on anyway, but that's another matter, eh?Recommended without reservation -- '10 out of 10', first film over an '8' this year for me.",10,0,0,26 September 1999
Saving Private Ryan," More Spielberg melodrama. Yawn.
","Sorry, but I don't like being manipulated and constantly being told what to feel, and Spielberg ALWAYS does this in his 'serious' films.  He should stick to light-hearted adventure stories, at which he is very good.The opening and closing cemetery scenes were heavy-handed.  The subject matter doesn't need flag-waving, Steven, we get the point without you rubbing our faces in it.The opening battle scene is very well done, except it's voyeuristic and even pornographic.  I saw the reaction of the kids in the front row and they were getting off on the blood and gore, just like in a video game.  I think Malick's filming of the battle scenes in The Thin Red Line was much more effective -- it puts you in the midst of the grass, fire, smoke, concussive explosions and total chaos and is quite unnerving.  Should've gotten the Best Cinematography Oscar.I cringed at Hanks' line 'Earn this'.  Again, Spielberg seems to think we can't get such insights on our own without them being crammed down our throats.  It's insulting.  To have Hanks speak that line implies an insult to Damon's character, too.The line,'Tell me I was a good man' is just awful script-writing. Groan.Let's see, how can I put this without giving away the plot and therefore having this review banned?  Okay, I thought it was really sophomoric to have the German POW that 'X' (a main American character who shall remain unnamed) turned loose be the one to kill 'X' in the end -- the odds against such a turn of events actually happening were quite overwhelming.  To put that in the script was an 'in your face' attempt at irony, right out of a bad film school project.I was mostly disappointed with what could have been a fine film if the director had not done what he always does -- practice overkill and leave nothing to the imagination, underestimating his audience, and propagandizing.I also think it's offensive to make a 'Good Yanks, Bad Krauts' film.  My uncles who fought against the German army knew better.  This war, contrary to those who want to rewrite history to make it pretty, was about property, not saving the Jews nor stopping fascism (except when fascism threatened other people's property).  Nazism was tolerated and even approved of in Britain, France and the U. S. before Hitler invaded France, and Britain and the U. S. turned away Jewish refugees from Hitlerism even after the start of the war.  The Americans didn't enter the war to stop Hitler, they made huge profits from it till 1941, and only entered it when the Japanese made it impossible for them to stay out of it.  This film's ideology pretends otherwise.Malick's film is much more accurate and, therefore, much less popular. Based faithfully on the novel by James Jones (who fought in Guadalcanal), it doesn't use war as a way to make people feel good, it tells the truth about war and those who fight in it, not disparagingly but realistically.  I care about its characters, because they are believable, not caricatures like those in Private Ryan.  The Thin Red Line is all the more uplifting because of its realism, and more enduring.For those, by the way, who keep writing that we who prefer The Thin Red Line are 'pseudo-intellectual', I think they really mean that they themselves are anti-intellectual, a popular stance in the U. S. these days.From a friend in Canada, where unlike most of you in the States, we take ourselves and our mythologies with a healthy grain of salt.",3,1,3,26 September 1999
The Green Mile," It's not a great film just because they made you cry.
","Nice packaging, but too much of it. Typical Stephen King story, well-told but not much weight.  Full of stereotypes and predictable good guy/bad guy stuff.  I loved Tom Hanks in 'Philadelphia' -- that was a challenging role and he performed it magnificently, with depth of character, pathos but no sentimentality.  Ever since, though, he's taken on one interchangeable role after another. Enough, already. The sad thing is that I truly CAN believe that almost 50% of the IMDB voters so far rate this very average and over-long film as a '10'.  Excellence apparently is a function of the volume of tears they make you shed.  I say, 'make you', because I think this film fully intends to manipulate emotions -- the emotions of white, comfortable, middle class Americans who enjoy cheering for the oppressed, simple but pure of heart big black man who is abused by Southern crackers.  Aren't we glad we're not like that? Yet again, a black man gets to be a parody, not a person.  We white folks don't have to be afraid just because he's big and black, see, 'cause he's really a Jesus figure ('J. C.', his initials).  What a relief. Still wouldn't want him living next door, though, would we? All in all, good actors playing two dimensional roles. In the real world, as Kosovo and Northern Ireland and Rwanda show, we're all just a hair-trigger away from being cruel.  Let's have more films that recognize that there are few good guys and bad guys, just a whole lot of us doing the best we can and trying to do it right.  That's too complicated for most Hollywood types, and doesn't usually make much money. 'Dead Man Walking' was ten times the film that this one was, and even it wasn't a '10'.'Besieged' and 'The Informer' were so much better than 'The Green Mile' that to mention Oscars without naming those films is ridiculous.And that's all this middle-aged long-time and ardent lover of films has to say.",1,32,114,24 December 1999
The Thin Red Line," Every movie-goer sees his own film...
","Having taken the time to read scores of reviews for TTRL (including IMDb ones here), I'm reminded of the movie subscript for this most controversial film:  'Every man fights his own war.'  What a polarization exists amongst its viewers, and a lot of emotion both ways.I was stunned, moved, transfixed and totally absorbed by this film, even more so on subsequent viewings.  I was one of the considerable number of people who, as the credits appear, sit quietly till one has to leave -- still stuck in the film's experience.  I'm not angry at others who merely fell asleep.  It's odd how some of the film's harsher critics seem compelled to vent their anger in disparaging comments against those who loved it -- most of those who liked the film were gentler in commenting on its critics.In contrast to what some have written, 'The thin red line' has nothing to do with the British infantry in its imperial past.  Jones referred to two related quotes in his excellent book, both having to do with a thin line between sanity and insanity.  Whether 'justified' or not, necessary or not, there is a lot of insanity in the war experience by anyone's definition of insanity.War exists and seems to recreate itself -- I never got the idea from Malick's film that he was preaching that we should just stop having wars. On the contrary, he takes war as a given in the human part of nature, and shows how individual human beings variously adapted (or mal-adapted!) in order to be able to keep eating, breathing and, yes, killing.  The war experience is not primarily about shooting and blowing things up -- as Jones described from his own experience, it's largely about what happens between skirmishes -- strife and comradeship, fear and bravado, homesickness and freedom from past constraints, and waiting to die or to see a buddy die. People came, died, and were replaced -- much as portrayed by the cameo appearances in the film that confused or upset some viewers.  Veterans always talk about how hard it is when you have to rely on your buddies (and feel for them) even though odds are most of them will die.What is most important to me (and it doesn't have to be for anyone else, I know that) is how the eternal themes of humanity are affected and expressed in such circumstances.  All great works of art have something to do with the themes of beauty, pain, triumph, despair, good and evil.  There's nothing wrong with entertainment as a diversion (The Matrix was fine fun); there's room both for film for fun and for film as art.  Saving Ryan's Privates was mostly good entertainment (although I found it terribly manipulative and jingoistic), while TTRL explores the themes I mentioned above, never with easy answers.  If you found the voice-overs heavy-handed, maybe it's because you're used to Hollywood telling us what to think and feel and thought Malick was doing the same.  Watch again and see if he's not just giving us access to various individuals' often conflicting perspectives.As for those who think the film portrays 'our soldiers' in a bad light, my family members who fought in WWII described their experiences and their reactions much as those shown in TTRL -- they were ordinary men, decent enough people, not heroes though sometimes unpredictably capable of the heroic, and devastated by their experiences.  I'm proud of them for having done all they could to do what they felt was their responsibility, and to keep some humanity intact in spite of the horror.  None of them told me they felt 'ennobled' by war; they endured it and were badly hurt by it but didn't feel sorry for themselves, either.In TTRL I got to see this portrayed with such compassion I wept.  Even the guy (Dale) who ripped gold teeth out of the mouths of dying Japanese soldiers was no stereotypical villain -- he has his moment of grace as do they all.  No one's defenses are portrayed as impregnable, not even Witt's. No stereotype himself, we see him kill over a dozen soldiers in battle, while still trying to see God in the midst of the chaos. And what a powerful scene at his life's end, fulfilling his own striving for self-sacrifice, and recognizing in a moment of epiphany where his own immortality lie.  Those who couldn't find a plot line in the film must have missed the first ten minutes...Maybe it's because of my own experience in life that I respond to this film so strongly.  I endured and survived ten years of intense, inescapable unrelenting abuse as a child.  I remember even as a small child trying to make sense of it all -- looking for the good, the reasons, God's plan, my purpose.  Others who've survived trauma (in the Holocaust camps, on the cancer wards) often describe how such experiences focussed their attention on things that matter, beyond the physical realities they could not control. Ever since my childhood I've moved through life with a second awareness -- that examination and self-examination while 'real time' goes on.That's what Malick portrayed, for me, in this film.  Maybe you think that's 'sophomoric' or 'pretentious'.  It may not seem so when you're in the midst of a struggle, or on your death bed...DGHP. S.  I organized a special screening of this film locally for a few friends -- 400 others paid to come, by word of mouth. Over a hundred sat spell-bound as the credits scrolled by -- hushed and not wanting to leave. Fellow wounded souls, some of them, I'll bet.",10,425,504,1 May 1999
