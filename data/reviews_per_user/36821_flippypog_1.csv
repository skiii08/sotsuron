Hereditary," The sad state of modern horror movies
","When a collective audience laughs through the entire movie and screams WTF at the end, you know you've just watched a terrible film, horror or otherwise. The story, when there is one, is so disjointed and silly that it ruins the acting, resulting in a bunch of unnecessarily long slow pans and over the top histronics. Throw in an absolutely abysmal and distracting soundtrack and you have the makings of a major bomb. I'm truly hoping this one movie will put an end to the hype machine vs. reality conceit surrounding movies of this type, but I somehow doubt it. When you know you have a stinker, all you have left is hype if you want to make your investment back. And a lot of us fell for it. Sad.",1,174,359,12 June 2018
