Hereditary," What did I just watch?
","I'm not really asking, but I while I fully understand the story line, I don't understand the high ratings. This story line has been over done. Satanic worshippers who are trying to bring a demon back to all it's power by helping it to possess the ideal host. I gave it the 5 stars because of the acting and the few times I cringed while watching, but in so many ways this film leaves much to be desired. The unanswered questions it leaves you with are frustrating to say the least and the weirdness of it over powers the scary. I should know better than to trust reviews anymore.",5,1,4,2 October 2018
Bird Box," I don't understand critics sometimes...
","I enjoy reading user reviews instead of critics... critics seem to have weird ideas about what good movies are.Anywho... Bird Box was one of the best movies I've seen all year. It had an essence of A Quiet Place and even of The Happening (only with better acting). From start to finish it kept me enthralled. I watched it two more times in my couple days off from work, enjoying more each time. Sandra Bullocks performance was exceptional showing she just gets better as the years go on. The supporting roles were all well casted.I recommend this movie looking for an action film, a thriller even a romance. A+ Netflix.",10,11,32,23 December 2018
