Conquest 1453," Excellent Movie
","For a long time, the only mainstream movies produced on events of historic importance to the Muslims have been Moustapha Akkad's The Message and Lion of the Desert.Many Muslims I know take to watching movies on Jesus or anything which has an overlap with their civilization, like Kindgom of Heaven covering Saladin.But this is going to be the first movie dedicated to a topic that Muslims romanticize about, both owing to its historical and spiritual significance in their religion. The ottoman empire is very well loved in the Muslim world, so much so that even their gold dinar based monetary system is being replicated as far away as in Malaysia. So it is understandable that a movie on the ottoman empire's highest watermark will definitely evoke a lot of emotional response in its watchers. This movie is a treat!",10,9,35,1 May 2012
