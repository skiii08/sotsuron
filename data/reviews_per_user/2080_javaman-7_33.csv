Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino displays his formidable writing and character development skills.
","Vol. 2 continues the cycle of revenge, as well as flashing back to earlier events which provide context and motivation for some of the dizzying action of the first episode. The Bride, whose name we learn is Beatrix Kiddo, must deal with Bill's trailer-trash brother Budd (Madsen) and the deadly, one-eyed Elle Driver (Hannah) before her showdown with Bill (Carradine). We also learn that she has studied with Kung Fu master Pai Mei (Liu) and has learned techniques that will take on significance as her odyssey continues.All through Arthurian legend and Eastern myth, the magic, invincible sword has been a central symbol invested with unending layers of significance. Filmmakers have taken great care to photograph it just the right angle, with just the right highlights so that its power and meaning can never be questioned. In Vol. 1, The Bride acquires such a sword from the legendary Hattori Hanzo, who comes out of retirement to make a weapon so powerful that 'if in your journey you should encounter God, God will be cut.' But another such blade is in possession of Bill's brother Budd, who must use it to prevent her from getting to Bill. When Bill asks Budd where this myth-laden, highly significant symbol of power might be, Budd says, 'I pawned it.' 'But it was priceless.' 'Well, I got $250 bucks for it.' This is the sort of dialogue that can only be called Tarantinian. TIn my review of Vol. 1, I wrote: 'But this is only Volume 1, and we don't even know what the main character's backstory is yet. Tarantino has Volume 2 to fill in some of the missing motivation as well as display his formidable writing and character development skills.'And that is exactly what he does in Vol. 2. He has created great characters on the page and has brought them to life with flawless casting and seamless direction. Thurman's Beatrix may be studied in future years as one of the all-time great women characters ever put on screen. Both she and Carradine should start shopping for formal wear when awards season rolls around. Tarantino may even have a shot at Best Director. Also riveting is the performance by Hannah as Beatrix' rival, both for Bill's affection and for martial arts supremacy. Their confrontation is a masterpiece of choreography, stunt work, and eye-catching editing. Note that at the end of the credits there is a hilarious out-take from this scene.One often hears the comment that 'they don't make movies like they used to.' But with young filmmakers such as Tarantino and older ones the likes Scorsese, Eastwood and Polanski all working at top form, we may just be in the middle of a filmic golden age and just don't know it yet.",10,1,1,20 May 2020
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The joke's on us, and Kazakhstan is in on it.
","Java Man Reviews 'Borat: Cultural Leanings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' (2006, R). Directed by Larry Charles. Written by Sacha Baron Cohen, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham & Don Mazer. Starring Sacha Baron Cohen, Ken Davitian & Pamela Anderson. Running Time: 83 minutes. This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW: Borat (Cohen) is a Kazakh TV journalist who has been assigned to come to America and make a documentary about our people and culture. He also happens to be a sexist, racist, chauvinist, and any other 'ist' one could possibly imagine. In his NYC hotel room, he sees an old Baywatch episode, becomes smitten with Pamela Anderson and decides to head for Hollywood--in an old ice cream truck--in order to make her his bride.On the way, he and his crew, including his slovenly producer Azamat (Davitian) encounter a cross section of everyday Americans, upsetting and insulting every one of them as they go. He bickers over women's brain size with feminists, parties with drunken frat boys and visits the home of southern conservatives with a prostitute as his date. When invited to sing our national anthem at a rodeo, he is at first greeted with cheers, until he revises the lyrics and the audience viciously turns on him. He barely escapes.REVIEW: 3 1/2 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS 'Satire is a sort of glass, wherein beholders do generally discover everybody's face but their own.' Jonathan Swift When this film first came out, there was a lot of talk about how the nation of Kazakhstan was displeased about being the victim of Cohen's unkind cuts. We laughed. But as we file out of the movie, we realize that it is America, not Kazakhstan, whose face is discovered in Cohen's Swiftian mirror. I suspect that the central Asian nation, with its recent increase in tourism, may have been in on the joke.In fact, the British Cohen (who is also Jewish) is following in a great satiric tradition made popular in the coffeehouses of early 18th century England in the stories of Addison and Steele, as well as Swift. It is called the 'Innocent Eye' or 'Fish out of Water' technique, where an outside observer innocently reacts to the absurdities of the predominant society. Cohen takes it to its limits, and thus the well-deserved R rating.There are many gross-out moments, especially when Borat nude wrestles with his fleshy producer; but there are also huge laughs, as we look on while people just like us become Borat's victims. Cohen stays in character even when he is about to be pummeled. In fact, Borat--and not Cohen--has traveled the movie's promotional talk-show circuit. His appearance on Conan O'Brien's late-night show was especially disgusting (and, of course, funny).Director Charles deserves a lot of credit here. No stranger to comedy, the Seinfeld veteran somehow convinced all these people to cooperate, shot the scenes with a straight face, and got each set-up done in one take. (Once the marks knew they were made, the crew would have to wrap the set and make a quick getaway). The American location work is engaging, but the opening scenes in Kazakhstan are wonderfully bizarre. (They were actually shot in Rumania).Suggestion: When the nude wrestling sequence starts, take a trip to the refreshment stand.",8,5,10,18 September 2007
United 93," A significant work of cinematic art about a crucial moment in U.S. history
","Java Man Reviews 'United 93' (rated R). Written and directed by Paul Greengrass. Starring J.J. Johnson, Ben Sliney, Gregg Henry, David Alan Basche, Christian Clemenson, Becky London, Trish Gates, Cheyenne Jackson & Chip Zien. Running Time: 91 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW:This film follows the brief and fateful journey of United flight number 93 as it takes off from Newark, flies toward San Francisco, suddenly reverses direction while over Cleveland, aims itself at Washington, D.C. and finally crashes in a Pennsylvania field. Exactly what happened during these 91 minutes can never be fully known, but much has been reconstructed from flight recorders, cell phone conversations and interviews of key officials and family members. British writer-director Greengrass incorporates these facts carefully but relies on his own artistic integrity to fill in the missing pieces and provide us with a version of the 'emotional truth.' What we do know is that the passengers of United 93 transformed themselves from a group of strangers to a determined force that prevented the terrorists from hitting their intended target. According to Greengrass, 'they were the first people to inhabit the post-9/11 world.' The film also reenacts simultaneous activities taking place inside the National Air Traffic Control Center, airport towers, regional air control centers, and a military command room. Many of those who were on duty that day portray themselves, including FAA honcho Ben Sliney who ordered the shutdown of all U.S. air traffic.REVIEW: 4 out of 4 Java MugsLet's get one thing out of the way...this is not a 'Hollywood' movie. There is no exploitation or emotional manipulation of any kind. Every detail of the story is told in the present tense; the narrative only knows what we would know if we were on the plane that day or in one of the flight control centers trying to piece together what was happening. There is no political posturing, no mention of Osama bin Laden, no patriotic speeches and no larger-than-life heroes--just an exhilarating account of ordinary men and women who are suddenly propelled into history and legend. Though an effective 'you are there' account of what may have actually happened, the film is not a docudrama but an accomplished work of cinematic art. This is certainly the furthest thing from his mind, but Greengrass should be a front runner for a best director nod when the awards season rolls around. The casting is flawless; we have never seen these actors before, so we easily accept them as fellow travelers aboard the fated flight. Also, the flight center and military personnel who portray themselves are vital to the film's authentic feel. Fluid, hand-held camera-work and fast-paced, precise editing also contribute to a feeling of immediacy. This may be difficult for some to watch, but it does portray a crucial moment in U.S. history, a moment we can share as we experience this film --and relive a day we will never forget. What better way to pay tribute to the heroes of United Flight 93 than to create a significant work of cinematic art in their honor?",10,8,15,27 April 2008
Star Trek," Mr. Sulu, take us to the sequel
","Java Man Reviews 'Star Trek' Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com May, 2009.OVERVIEW:J. J. Abrams and his film-making team have taken the legendary Star Trek franchise back to its origins, to a point even before the TV series had its debut in 1966. Like James Bond and Casino Royale, the narrative reveals how familiar characters were forged by the fires of experience. For example, Kirk (Pine) began as a rebellious Iowa farm boy, Spock (Quinto) a conflicted (and emotional!) half-breed, Uhura (Saldana) a linguistic genius, and McCoy (Urban) a divorced intern who was left with nothing but his bones. Chekov, Sulu and Scotty (Yelchin, Cho & Pegg) also have intriguing back stories that plausibly project into the characters we remember from the series. After some initial rough going, including a bitter rivalry between Spock and Kirk, the crew eventually finds itself on board the Enterprise in hot pursuit of the Romulan villain, Nero (Bana), who is destroying Federation planets in revenge for his own planet's demise. Nero is from another time, and his nemesis is a future version of Spock (Nimoy). By the end of the action, the familiar scene is set, as Kirk and his crew return to the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. REVIEW: 3 1/2 out of 4 Java MugsWhen Gene Roddenberry introduced Star Trek TV series over 40 years ago, he created a universe full of fascinating characters and situations, along with lots of action and adventure. He also mixed in imaginative ideas about literature, religion, philosophy, and what it is to be human (or any other life form). For fans of the series, the characters he created are indelible. What this film is tasked with doing is to recreate these characters with a new generation of actors, each of whom must channel their originals in such a way that fans find it plausible. (Yeah, that could be James T. Kirk, as a preteen leading an Iowa state trooper on a merry chase in a 'borrowed' corvette.) Though the appearance of Nimoy as the elder Spock does help tie the generations together, it will take the next edition of the series before we find out how well the filmmakers have done. Will the writing and characterization rise to the level of Roddenberry's genius? We can only hope.For non-Trekkies and Star Wars fans, there is plenty for you too. The film holds up quite well as a Sci-Fi thriller with a warp-speed storyline, a suitably sinister villain, stunning visuals, lots of attractive future stars and not a few laughs.Mr. Sulu, take us to the sequel.",9,3,12,8 May 2009
Iron Man 2," Johansson and Jackson indicted for scene stealing
","Java Man Reviews 'Iron Man 2' Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com May, 2010.OVERVIEW: While the identity of most super heroes remains shrouded in mystery, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.) has been publicly revealed as the breast-plated bad-boy known as Iron Man. Unlike Batman or Spiderman, Stark has to deal with things like Senate hearings, jealous G-Men and rival CEOs. Everyone wants the Iron Man technology. Meanwhile, over in Russia, a metallic mastermind named Ivan (Rourke) is steeling himself to challenge Stark for world supremacy. Returning from the original Iron Man are Stark's trusted assistant Pepper Potts (Paltrow) and army liaison 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Cheadle). New characters are Natasha Romanoff (Johansson) and Nick Fury (Jackson) both of whom add a big dose of scene-stealing appeal. REVIEW: 3 of 4 Java Mugs Sequels are inevitably compared to their originals and more often than not they don't measure up. Because of the cast, this one could have been an exception: Downey is still a marvel to watch and Paltrow may be even better in this version; Cheadle, who replaces Terrence Howard, is also fine. Rourke and Rockwell as villains and Jackson and Johansson as intriguing spy types are all fascinating; and Shandling as the chairman of a Senate investigating committee is hilarious. But the screenplay is very much by-the-numbers, and it just doesn't add up. The captivating characters and stimulating situations which distinguished the original have given way to long and loud action sequences. But if it's action you want, you've got it; these scenes are very well done and are accompanied by lots of heavy metal music (what else?). The cinematography is also noticeably sharp with a lots of excellent aerial views. Great location work in and around California, and in Monaco during the principality's Grand Prix, also adds to the film's visual vitality. I waited in a long line to see this movie, but it was worth it because of the enthusiastic audience that surrounded me. Come early to get a good seat--and stay late through the end credits for a big hint at what may be coming next from the franchise.",7,25,52,5 May 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Everyone looks good in Hawaii.
","Java Man Reviews 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' (Rated R). Directed by Nicholas Stoller. Written by Jason Segel. Starring Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, Russell Brand, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill, Kala Alexander, Paul Rudd, William Baldwin, Jason Bateman, Jack McBrayer and Da'vone McDonald. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com May, 2008.OVERVIEW:Schlubby Peter Bretter (Segel) composes music for a CSI-like TV show that stars his gorgeous girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Bell). Relegated to such indignities as holding her purse during photo shoots, Peter is nevertheless deeply in love. So when she tells him that 'there is someone else,' he is devastated. The someone else is self-absorbed British rocker Aldous Snow (Brand), who could have been separated at birth from Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow.After a tragicomic montage of meaningless sexual encounters, Peter decides that a trip to Hawaii would be just the thing to encourage him to live up to this film's title. But as luck (and movie logic) would have it, Sarah and Aldous are already shacked up at the same hotel when Peter arrives. Amid the chance encounters and amusing awkwardness, Peter meets Rachel (Kunis), a hotel employee who may be a romantic prospect--or just a competent resort worker who his pleasant to her customers.REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java MugsIf you like movies that begin with a break-up and end with a match-up (and who doesn't?), then this is the film for you. But it is the midsection of the movie, the time spent in Hawaii, that is the most entertaining. The film is a slight variation on the romantic comedy formula: Boy Meets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy and Girl Both Go to Hawaii. Why so far away? Woody Allen could have filmed this story within a few city blocks of his Manhattan apartment.Here's why: Since fantasy vacations are becoming so expensive, why not let the movies take us to some of these exotic locales. And Hawaii is one of the most stunning, a place where beams of golden sun bathe land and sea and make everyone look good--including the lead actors and lighting directors.Segel, who also wrote the screenplay, gives an adequate performance as Peter, and provides some of the film's more embarrassing moments with brief(less) episodes of frontal nudity. The two women in his life are appropriately attractive, though it may stretch credibility to believe either would actually be interested in Peter.Other memorable performances include Brand as the cynical, oversexed rocker, Rudd as a drugged-out surfing instructor, and McBrayer and McDonald as Christian honeymooners who are just realizing that there is a physical aspect to the marriage sacrament. Some of the funniest moments come with send-ups of the police procedural TV genre, featuring hilarious, straight-faced cameos by Baldwin and Bateman.",7,3,10,18 May 2008
The Other Boleyn Girl," Proto-femme fatale captures the king's fancy and plays him like a lute.
","Java Man Reviews 'The Other Boleyn Girl' (Rated PG-13. Directed by Justin Chadwick. Written by Peter Morgan. Starring Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana, David Morrissey, Kristen Scott Thomas, Mark Rylance, Jim Sturgess & Ana Torrent. Running Time: 115 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW: England's Henry VIII (Bana) and his Queen, Katherine of Aragon (Torrent) have been unable to produce a male heir to secure the Tudor royal line. While the Henry decides on a course of action, he finds himself in need of a mistress. The Duke of Norfolk (Morrissey) and Sir Thomas Boleyn (Rylance) realize that their family fortunes can be greatly enhanced if Boleyn makes one of his fetching daughters available for the king's consideration. Strong-willed Anne (Portman, pictured left) is chosen, but soon falls out of favor and is banished to France. Naive Mary (Johansson, right) then catches the king's eye and becomes his lover, even though she is already married to a merchant's son (who approves the match when offered a cushy job at court). By the time Henry loses interest in Mary, Anne is back from France having studied the womanly wiles of the femme fatale. She captures the king's fancy and plays him like a lute. She will gladly submit once his majesty meets a few minor requirements... break with the Church of Rome, annul his marriage to Katharine, and take her as his queen. The rest is history -- and you know some heads are gonna roll.REVIEW: 2.5 Java Mugs out of 4 This is the story of how the course of human history was changed when the most powerful man in the world risked his kingdom and his soul for the love of a beautiful woman. I'm not sure any movie can do justice to such a momentous theme, and this one wisely doesn't even try. It begins as a mildly interesting, conventional costumer, but somewhere along the way deteriorates into an embarrassingly soapy melodrama.While the characterizations never rise to the level of the historical figures they are based upon, the acting itself is more than enough to keep the viewer's interest. As the king, Bana seems a strange casting choice. My image of Henry forever remains Charles Laughton gleefully devouring a leg of mutton. Bana's Henry is much younger, more virile and interested in legs, but not of the mutton variety. The problem with Bana is that his kingly bearing is overshadowed whenever one of the Boleyn girls enters the frame.Portman is nicely naughty as England's most notorious seductress, while Johansson brings the voluptuously innocent Mary as far as the screenplay will allow her. The supporting cast is impressive too, with Morrissey as the dastardly duke of Norfolk, Scott Thomas as a proto-feminist Lady Boleyn and Torrent as the spurned Katharine.The movie's greatest strength is certainly the art direction and production design. All of the exteriors and many of the interiors were shot in castles and estates that actually date back to the period portrayed. England has what it calls the National Trust, a system that preserves its history all the way back to King Arthur. It's great for tourists... and movie makers, too.In many movies made in England the setting is often a central character, and -- as in this film -- one of the most interesting.",7,0,1,20 April 2008
Juno," Feel-good movie of the year for Film Appreciation teacher
","Java Man Reviews 'Juno' (Rated PG-13). Directed by Jason Reitman. Written by Diablo Cody. Starring Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney, J. K. Simmons & Olivia Thirlby. Running Time: 92 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW:Juno MacGuff (Page) is a 16-year-old girl who decides it's time to have her first sexual experience. In an inelegant seduction scene, she persuades her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Cera) to participate in her adventurous experiment. Of course she gets pregnant. After a touching trip to an abortion clinic, she decides to put the baby up for adoption. Her girlfriend Leah (Thirlby) suggests looking at the ads for potential parents in the Penny Saver... 'They have 'Desperately Seeking Spawn,' right next to the pet ads.' When Juno breaks the news to her mom and dad (Janney and Simmons) their reaction is both priceless and hilarious. Her dad accompanies her to meet the upscale prospective parents, Vanessa and Mark Loring (Garner and Bateman). Vanessa seems overly obsessed with becoming a mom, while Mark is a jingle-writer who always wanted to be a rock star. Juno and Mark have similar tastes in music and hit it off -- almost too well. The film follows Juno for the full nine months as we get glimpses of the deeper feelings beneath the teenager's wisecracking exterior. What will she eventually do? The film has too many surprises to make that an easy guess.REVIEW: 4 out of 4 Java MugsWhen Jon Stewart hosted the Oscar telecast earlier this year, he commented on the dark themes that characterized the other four Best Picture nominees: war, betrayal, murder and greed. Then he said... 'Thank God for teen pregnancy.' Though this film doesn't quite qualify as 'feel-good movie of the year,' a picture this well-made makes a film appreciation teacher feel pretty good about the state of cinema.First of all, the screenplay is smart, and so are the characters. Though a serious subject, there is plenty of humor, which comes from witty dialogue and inspired plotting and not from people taking pratfalls. Director Reitman has also done an exceptional job of casting the film with such old pros as Janney and Simmons who play Juno's parents to perfection, and newcomers Cera and Thirlby as Juno's perceptive pals. Garner brings unexpected depth to a character we originally perceive as hopelessly shallow.While all the parts are well-acted and well-written (by Oscar winner Cody), the movie belongs to Ellen Page. With dazzling brilliance, she portrays a very bright girl who makes a mistake, lives with it, and attempts to solve her problems in unique and imaginative ways. A star in the making? The 21-year old Nova Scotian has actually been around for a few years, burning up screens in Canadian theaters and on north-of-the-border television.My Oscar class debated whether or not this movie has a political axe to grind. Pro choice or pro life? We couldn't agree. We did agree on one thing... Juno is one of the year's best.",10,3,8,25 April 2008
Yes Man," With Carrey in the lead this screenplay should write itself
","Java Man Reviews 'Yes Man' (PG-13) Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com December, 2008.OVERVIEW:Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a divorced 40-something who lives in LA and works as a loan officer for a neighborhood bank. Depressed at being dumped, he says 'no' to everything: 'no' to unlucky loan applicants; 'no' to his best pal (Bradley Cooper) who wants to hit the bars; and 'no' to his sex-starved neighbor (Fionnula Flanagan) who wants him to get intimate. While sitting home alone watching a video one night, he nods off and dreams of his demise. When he awakens, he realizes that he has a problem and reluctantly agrees to attend a 'Power of Yes' seminar conducted by self-help guru Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp). After initial resistance, Carl is finally won over and accepts the Covenant of Yes. This means that when he says 'no' (say, to his naughty neighbor), bad things happen--like being trapped in an elevator. When he says 'yes' (giving all his money to a homeless guy), good things happen--like meeting gorgeous, free-spirited Allison (Zooey Deschanel). The comic possibilities are endless. REVIEW: 2.5 out of 4 Java MugsWith Carrey in the lead role, a story like this should write itself. Or at least one would think so. The movie is funny enough, but somehow it seems like it should have been funnier. Perhaps the premise has too many comic possibilities for its own good. It ends up being a mishmash of random episodes, some of which are inspired while others should have been consigned to the cutting room floor. It can't be blamed on the cast. Appealing newcomers Cooper and Deschanel light up the screen, while veterans Stamp and Flanagan make the most of their unimaginatively written roles. The talented Carrey is more than adequate, but he is unable to convincingly sell the outlandish premise as well as he did in a similar, better movie, Liar Liar.The film has great production values and is quite watchable. The action scenes and stunt work are top notch, while the location work is inspired. Underutilized LA backdrops such as the Hollywood Bowl and Griffith Park Observatory are used so well that this film's portrayal of the city rivals Woody Allen's love affair with the Big Apple. This movie offers a point to go with your popcorn: that saying yes once in a while can open you up to life's infinite possibilities. Frank Capra would have loved it.",6,8,16,20 December 2008
Milk," Characters we might meet on Castro Street
","Java Man Reviews 'Milk.' Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com January, 2009.OVERVIEW: The film opens with Harvey Milk (Penn) at the age of 48 speaking into a tape recorder and reflecting on the last 8 years of his life. His compelling journey began at age 40 when as a Wall Street wonder boy he realized that there is more to life than hiding in the closet and collecting paychecks. He meets and falls in love with Scott Smith (Franco) and they move to San Francisco to open a camera shop on Castro Street, where the gay community is being continuously harassed by homophobic police. The camera store becomes a gathering place for young gays, such as Cleve Jones and Anne Kronenberg (Hirsch and Pill), who are becoming increasingly active in the fight for gay rights. After several defeats, Milk is elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors where he meets and works with Mayor George Moscone (Garber) and fellow supervisor Dan White (Brolin). As the film progresses, these three men move inevitably toward a crucial moment in San Francisco history.REVIEW: 4 out of 4 Java Mugs We know how this ends: Dan White walks into Mayor George Moscone's office, kills him, and then continues down the hall and into Supervisor Harvey Milk's office and kills him. So how does this film hold our interest (not to mention earn a 4-mug rating from this stingy critic)? It holds our interest because all of the elements of great film-making make an appearance.It begins with Dustin Lance Black's compelling screenplay, based on a few short years in the life of a compelling character.It also takes outstanding performances to bring the screenplay's characters to life. Penn is brilliant as the charismatic Milk while Brolin is exceptional as the ticking bomb who is Dan White. Other performances are solid, too, especially Hirsch, Franco and Pill as Milk's political pals. The cast is so competent and well-directed that we forget that they actors, but consider them as characters we might actually meet on Castro Street.At the helm of all this is director Van Sant and his team of fellow artists who have used their film-making skills to take us back to another time. The setting is created in such a way that San Francisco of the seventies comes to life before our very eyes. The way they dress, the way they speak, the interior of the camera store--everything is accurate to the tiniest detail. Hand-held shots, close-ups, razor-sharp editing are all used effectively to evoke a sense of urgency and suspense.There is a remarkable shot near the end, showing a candlelight march reaching as far as the eye can see. This is actual footage, in which Van Sant manages to insert several of his characters. It is emotionally powerful.Each of the elements of great film-making mentioned here are represented by Oscar nominations for Black, Van Sant, Penn and Brolin. Then add 3 more for costume design, music and editing, and we can look for a few statuettes to find their way to the Milk contingent.",10,5,12,30 January 2009
Knocked Up," A sexy, vulgar, R-rated . . . family values film.
","Java Man Reviews 'Knocked Up' (2007, R). Written and directed by Judd Apatow. Starring Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, Tim Bagley, Kristen Wiig & Loudon Wainwright III. Running Time: 129 minutes. This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW: Ben Stone (Rogan) is a 20-something slacker who, like his similarly unmotivated roommates, lives the life of a college kid without actually attending classes. Their big goal in life is to develop a website that will inform its users as to the exact location of nudity in any given movie. Alison Scott (Heigl) is an unsuccessful but ambitious 20-something broadcast staffer who lives with her bitchy older sister Debbie (Mann) and Debbie's weirdly wayward husband Pete (Rudd). When Alison gets her big break by being offered an on-camera gig with the E! Network, she decides to go out on the town to celebrate. After having too much to drink she meets Ben, accompanies him to his apartment, and unsafe sex ensues.In the morning, seeing Ben in the full light of his dorkiness, she bids him farewell and is about to begin her new life as a minor media personality . . . until several weeks later when she discovers that Ben has left her with more than just memories. Do I have to spell it out? The movie's inelegant title says it all. The balance of the movie follows the mismatched couple's attempts to work out their newly altered lives.REVIEW: 3 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS Though I don't like this movie as much as most other reviewers seem to, I must admit that it has grown on me. When I first walked out of the theater, it bothered me that the film seems to say that it is okay for guys in their 20s to do nothing but drink beer and take hits on a bong, and that it's also okay for a 20-something couple to meet at a bar and have a one-night stand. But, thanks to a mix-up in a conversation about condoms, there are consequences; and when I look at this film in retrospect, it seems to be a sexy, vulgar, R-rated . . . family values film. Yet it doesn't come off as an anti-abortion polemic: she knows she has a choice and she chooses to have the baby.But I'm getting way too serious here. The real reason to see this movie is because it's well-written and funny. Many of the scenes have a Borat-like quality of becoming even more humorous when you think about them later. Two examples are the conversation Ben has with his dad, and Ben's refusal to have sex with a frustrated Alison for fear of crushing the baby.While Rogen may be an acquired taste, Heigl and the rest of the cast are right on the mark with Apatow's insightful material. Especially good are Mann as the judgmental sister and Wiig as Alison's subtly jealous rival.As the story progresses into more conventional here-comes-the-baby territory, the editor might have considered performing some surgical snips well in advance of the cutting of the umbilical chord.",Null,1,3,18 September 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," The Latter Day Rat Pack is Back
","Java Man Reviews 'Ocean's Thirteen' (2007, PG-13) Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Written by Brian Koppelman and David Levine. Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Ellen Barkin, Al Pacino, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould & David Paymer. Running Time: 122 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW: Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his latter day rat pack are back in Vegas for another high-stakes caper, this time with a new mark, Willy Bank (Pacino). Bank has swindled Reuben Tishkoff (Gould) out of his partnership share in a new casino and the resulting shock has put Reuben into the ICU. Danny and Rusty (Pitt) gather the gang together to avenge their old pal, and even hope a successful score may bring Reuben back from death's door. The idea is to sabotage the casino's opening night, filch Bank's fortune, ruin his reputation and get to the hospital in time to give Reuben the good news. Of course Bank's empire and all of its sophisticated systems are impregnable, but that's just one more challenge for Danny and his team (and for the screenwriters). Dice are magnetized in Mexico, shufflers and slot machines are rigged, a camera is hidden in Bank's office--but these are just routine tasks for the Thirteen. To make it all work, they must get Bank's computers to shut down for three minutes--and that would take an earthquake.REVIEW: 3 JAVA MUGS OUT OF 4 When Reuben learns of Bank's treachery,he tells him that 'You and I both shook Sinatra's hand, and there's a code among the guys who shook Sinatra's hand.' The image of 'Ol' Blue Eyes' (who also starred in the 1960 original) still looms large in Las Vegas. Whether it was his classy song stylings or his purported mob connections, the man owned that town. So when the swindler rudely replies 'Screw Sinatra's hand,' you know that Willy Bank will not long rule in the kingdom of cool.Pacino and Barkin, who burned up the screen in 1989's Sea of Love, make impressive villains and are welcome additions to the company. With a cast this stellar and a master filmmaker at the helm, there's no need to worry too much about the story. Just enjoy some of today's biggest stars in their best Armani duds as they swagger through the streets of Sin City.One or two of the subplots add interest, especially Bank's obsessive desire to gain a Five Diamond Award for his new operation. Sal Bloom (Reiner) poses as the evaluator, while the real rater (Paymer) is hilariously mistreated by some of the Ocean crew masquerading as hotel staff.One quibble: A few more women in the cast wouldn't hurt, though I certainly have no complaints about Barkin; it's just that last time out we had Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones.Next time, how about a prequel? Say Ocean's Five or Six, so I won't have to keep track of so many characters.",7,0,2,17 September 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," This (or any) summer's best action flick.
","Java Man Reviews ' The Bourne Ultimatum' (2007, PG-13). Directed by Paul Greengrass. Written by Tony Gilrooy, Scott Z. Burns & George Nolfi, based upon the Robert Ludlum novel. Starring Matt Damon, Julia Stiles, David Strathairn, Joan Allen, Scott Glenn, Paddy Considine, Edgar Ramirez & Albert Finney. Running Time: 111 minutes OVERVIEW: Jason Bourne (Damon) is still on the run from the mysterious government agency that turned him into a black-ops killer and now wants to get rid of him. A London investigative reporter (Considine) unintentionally unmasks Bourne, and the two of them embark on the first of several intriguing and complicated chases. But as the CIA pursues Bourne it is really he who is doing the pursuing, trying to find those responsible for turning him into a killing machine. After London he heads for Madrid, Tangier, Paris, Moscow and, finally, to New York City.Heading up the quest to eliminate Bourne is Noah Vosen (Strathairn), the hiss-worthy G-Man in charge of the CIA's killer spooks. Reluctantly, he must recruit the assistance of Pamela Landy (Allen), an internal investigator who has also been chasing Bourne, but who has developed a professional respect for him and wants him alive. In Tangier, Bourne encounters field op Nicky Parsons (Stiles), who works for Vosen, but has become disillusioned with her boss's methods. She joins Bourne on the run as he continually beats the agency at its own game, outwitting its surveillance systems and besting its top killers.REVIEW: 3 1/2 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS It's a simple formula, but it works: Keep Jason Bourne in a state of perpetual motion. But even though the film is one continuous chase, it still manages to create memorable and believable characters. The credit for that must go to director Greengrass, a Brit whose work is a cut above the current crop of crash-it, blow-it-up action hacks. In addition to the Bourne franchise, he has also directed some of the best docudramas ever put on screen, namely Bloody Sunday (2002) about the troubles in Northern Ireland and United 93 (2006), about the passengers who thwarted terrorists from blowing up our nation's capitol. He keeps things moving fast and keeps us involved; we are in on it, as though joining Bourne on the run.Damon's performance is first-rate as usual, in what now has become his signature role. Pros Allen and Strathairn provide a revealing contrast between the two sides of the espionage coin (the dedicated pro and the sinister spook). Stiles sparkles as the quiet, smart G-woman who helps Bourne. Later in the film, Finney has a few crucial scenes to wrap up the series. Glen, as the Machiavellian mastermind who heads the CIA, will likely play a major role if a fourth Bourne is mounted.As for the story, there is no real need for a complicated plot, just a reason for Bourne to be in a given city when Greengrass is ready to stage the next set-up. Spectacular cinematography and involving editing, combined with challenging location work, make this by far the summer's best action flick.Will there be a fourth Bourne? Though Ludlum has passed on, Ian Fleming's death did not stop James Bond from saving the world for nearly half a century now.",9,2,4,21 September 2007
Watchmen," Watching The Watchmen at Midnight in Lakewood, Ohio.
","Java Man Reviews 'The Watchmen.' Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com March, 2009.OVERVIEW: The year is a nightmare version of 1985 with Richard Nixon in his fifth term as President. The era of the superheroes (which started in 1940, as sort of costume club) is coming to an end. Nixon has used the awesome power of Dr. Manhattan (played by Billy Crudup) to subdue the Viet Cong, and is now riding high as the world's most powerful man. But the superheroes begin to disappear one by one, starting with the amusingly cynical Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Is Tricky Dick behind this conspiracy too? All of the events are being recorded in the journal of Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), whose mask is a constantly shifting pattern of blotches.A tender love story emerges between Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) and Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), each of whom has the romantic notion that they can make the world a better place. Silk Specter I (Carla Gugino) is II's shrewish mom. The other superhero who figures in the plot is Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), whose power is that he is 'the smartest man in the world.' (And I always thought that was Henry Kissinger, who, incidentally, is still Secretary of State).REVIEW: 3 1/2 out of 4 Java Mugs This film opened Friday, March 6, 2009, and The Detroit Theatre in Lakewood was one of the first to show it with a screening at midnight. When I heard that Richard Nixon was in this movie, and that he was still president in 1985, I thought it must be a horror flick. Actually, it is a very engaging adaptation of a graphic novel, complete with complex superheroes, a captivating plot and a fascinating collection of real-life pop icons (such as Ted Koppel, Truman Capote, Mick Jagger and Andy Warhol, in addition to Nixon and Kissinger).Probably the most intriguing of the superheroes is Haley's Rorschach who is investigating the disappearances and recording everything in his journal. He's even better when he takes off his mask. Just the opposite is true of Nite Owl and Silk Spectre II, who only captivate when in costume. Other watchable characters are Crudup's Dr. Manhattan and Gugino's Silk Spectre I.Though the film is long and the narrative a bit rambling, it never gets boring. The special effects and computer wizardry are excellent, but the film doesn't lean on them too heavily; something is happening all the time, and most of it is character driven. Everything looks just right, too, from the epic depiction of the planet of Mars to the small detail of the over-sized eyeglasses everyone used to wear in the '80s.While most of the action takes place in 1985, the filmmakers have made the surprisingly effective choice to comment on the action by way of songs from the '60s, including key classics from the songbooks of Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen and Paul Simon.As I stroll home after the bars have closed, I look forward to more midnight showings at the Detroit Theatre.",9,2,6,10 March 2009
21," The other actors can fold their cards when Kevin Spacey comes to the table
","Java Man Reviews '21' (Rated PG-13). Directed by Robert Luketic. Written by Peter Steinfeld & Allan Loeb, based upon the book 'Bringing Down the House' by Ben Mezrich. Starring Jim Sturgess, Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth, Laurence Fishburne, Aaron Yoo, Lisa Lapira, Jacob Pitts, Josh Gad & Sam Golzari. Running Time: 122 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com, May, 2008.OVERVIEW: Ben Campbell (Sturgess) is a shy but brilliant MIT student who wants to enroll at Harvard Medical School once he graduates, if only he can come up with the $300,000 for tuition. His math professor, Mickey Rosa (Spacey), recognizes his genius for numbers and invites him to join his special 'math club,' a group of fellow students who make weekly trips to Las Vegas to beat the casinos by counting cards at blackjack. Why apply for a student loan when so much easy money is to be made? The Vegas lifestyle soon seduces Ben -- as does one of his sexy-smart teammates (Bosworth) -- and he begins to lose his way. Warily watching all of the goings on is Cole Williams (Fishburne) the casino's old-school security chief who is trying to figure out why the weekly airbus from Boston seems to coincide with big losses for his client's casino.REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java Mugs Based on a real-life account of MIT students who won millions in Vegas casinos in the 1990s, the screenplay adds Hollywood melodramatics and romantic comedy tropes to an already remarkable story. In other words, its a lot of fun... and if you ever had a fantasy to beat the bank at your favorite gambling parlor, this is the movie to see.Sturgess and Bosworth are fine as the white-bread romantic leads, but the supporting cast is far more fascinating, including Gad and Golzari as Ben's nerdy pals, Yoo and Lapira as two of his colorful teammates, and Fishburne as the menacing casino cop.But the other actors might as well fold their cards when Kevin Spacey comes to the table. Feel free to hiss, because that is exactly the way he plays it; he chews up every scrap of scenery in a performance which alone is worth the price of admission.Watching a group of people sitting around playing blackjack is not the most visually exciting experience you could imagine, which provides a challenge for the filmmakers. They meet it by employing extreme close-ups, imaginative special effects, flashy camera angles and dynamic editing. Authentic backgrounds and great-looking characters don't hurt either.Pay attention to the card-counting lessons, and maybe you can make some money on your next casino trip. Just watch out for a mean-looking guy with spiky rings on every finger.",7,0,0,4 May 2008
Wanted," Angelina Jolie & this film: stylish and visually exciting
","Java Man Reviews 'Wanted' (Rated R). Directed by Timur Bekmambetov. Written by Michael Brandt, Derek Haas & Chris Morgan based upon the comic books by Mark Millar & J. G. Jones. Starring James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie, Terence Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann, Common, Mark Warren & David Patrick O'Hara. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com August, 2008.OVERVIEW: The movie opens with a heart-pounding action sequence as Mr. X (O'Hara) tries to avoid assassination by crashing through a plate-glass window and leaping into the Chicago skyline. He lands on a nearby rooftop where he and Cross (Kretschmann) fight a gun battle with bullets that bend around corners. Just as Mr. X meets his end, wimpy office worker Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) vacates his cubicle in a nearby building and heads home to his dreary life. On the way, he runs into the aptly named Fox (Jolie) who tells him that Mr. X was his father and that Cross is a rogue operative of The Fraternity, a 1000-year-old network of assassins who kill 'bad people.' She tells Wesley that he has inherited secret powers and that he is destined to join The Fraternity and help them eliminate Cross.Just when we begin to think that this is too absurd even for a movie based upon a comic book, Cross attacks the two of them and they escape in a car chase so intensely exciting that Wesley and the audience begin to buy into Fox's story... which gets even better. The Fraternity, headed by the brilliant Sloan (Freeman), is located in a textile factory where the fate of its victims is determined by the binary codes hidden in fabric patterns woven by the factory's looms. Wesley agrees to join, but first there is the initiation, conducted by a menacing assemblage with names like Repairman, Butcher and Exterminator.REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java Mugs:There must be an easier way to take out a target than to squeeze out a shot while standing atop a speeding Chicago L-train as it races past the target's office window. But then, it wouldn't be as stylish. It's the same reason Hitchcock staged the attempted killing of Cary Grant with a crop duster in broad daylight instead of a gun in a dark alley... to avoid cliché and to create a memorable scene.Russian director Bekmambetov creates many such scenes and never passes up a chance to add visual spice to a shot. There are slow motion bullets to follow in curving trajectories, reversing action to follow to its source, and Angelina Jolie (a tattooed visual effect unto herself) to follow anywhere. He even creates visual patterns to match the rhythm of Wesley's accelerating metabolism.In addition to Jolie, who was born for this role, other performers operate well within the director's energized universe, especially veterans Freeman and Stamp as the organization's sinister brain trust. McAvoy, who at first seems miscast, convincingly grows into the role of the apprentice assassin.The question remains, is the story credible? Of course not. Yet we are hooked into it just as the unwary victims are hooked into their destinies by the Loom of Fate.",7,3,7,10 August 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Dewey Cox: Riley makes him real
","Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (rated R). Directed by Jake Kasden. Written by Judd Apatow and Jake Kasden. Starring John C. Reilly, Jenna Fischer, Raymond J. Berry, Kristen Wiig, Tim Meadows, Harold Ramis & Chris Parnell. Running Time: 96 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com. OVERVIEW: Like the film Ray (2004), a young boy and his brother frolic in the bucolic wonderland of the American South of the 1930s. Like Walk the Line (2005), a young man leaves his loving mother and hateful father to find solace in his music. Like... well, you get the idea. This film is primarily a send-up of the musical bio-pic, as Dewey Cox (Riley) channels nearly every rock icon that ever took the stage... from Dylan, Cash, Orbison, and Presley to Brian Wilson. Like his fellow rock stars, Dewey is often tempted by drugs and sex. In a hilarious motif, he is constantly opening a door and finding his drummer, Sam (Meadows), behind it with sexy backup singers and the latest drug of choice. 'You don't want any part of this s**t,' Sam says, and proceeds to tell Dewey all of the drug's benefits. Despite their wayward ways, Dewey and his band are discovered by a trio of Hasidic Jews and begin to record a remarkable string of number-one hits. As he cruises the decades like Forrest Gump with a guitar, Dewey meets all of his legendary contemporaries, played by uncredited actors you are likely to recognize. Watch especially for Lennon, McCartney and Buddy Holly.REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java Mugs What is remarkable about this movie is the way we feel about the main character, Dewey Cox. It's easy to find sympathy for the likes of Johnny Cash and Ray Charles because we knew them as real people. But why do we feel so strongly about a singer we know does not really exist? Some of the credit goes to the filmmakers, who know which emotional buttons to push, but mostly we have Riley to thank. In an amazing portrayal, he takes what could have been a spoof-worthy sap and turns him into a fully developed character we really care about. Riley actually becomes Dewey Cox, by singing his heart out and even helping to write many of the film's songs.Other performances are also worthy of note, particularly Fischer's sultry Darlene, Wiig's ever-pregnant Edith and Meadows' drug-addled drummer.Though Riley's singing is quite good, it is still nice to have the likes of Lyle Lovett, Jackson Browne, Jewel, Ghostface Killah and Eddie Vedder playing themselves and singing those Dewey Cox originals. But none of the music was as brilliant as an early scene with Honeyboy Edwards singing the blues.",7,29,35,25 April 2008
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Magicians not to be messed with
","Java Man Reviews 'Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban' Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com July, 2004.OVERVIEW Harry (Radcliffe) and his pals Hermione and Ron (Watson and Grint) are now in their third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry when news arrives of the escape from prison of the notorious murderer Sirius Black (Oldman), who is after Harry. 'Protecting' the students are the Dementors, sinister wraiths that can suck souls from the bodies of their victims. Harry acquires a marauder's map which has special powers that come in handy as the story progresses, especially when a werewolf begins to prowl the grounds. Hagrid (Coltrane) introduces the three friends to Buckbeak, a hippogriff (half bird, half horse), who may be a match for the nocturnal beast. Most of the Hogwarts faculty is back, with some new additions, including Professors Lupin (Thewlis) and Trelawney (Thompson).REVIEW: 3 1/2 Java Mugs out of 4 Harry Potter (Radcliffe) transforms an obnoxious dinner guest into a hot-air balloon. Hermione Granger (Watson) lands an uppercut to the jaw of the despicable Draco Malfoy (Felton). These aren't the well-behaved, precocious preteens of the first Harry Potter movie. They, along with their primary audience, are growing into teenagers -- and are not to be messed with.There's an edge to this movie, thanks to the brilliant direction of Cuaron, one of Mexico's bright young movie makers and director of one of the best films to cross the Rio Grande in recent years... Y Tu Mama Tambien.Though the story follows much of the formula of the first two episodes, sharp writing and directing elevate the material beyond author Rowling's rules of order. Especially effective are the tricks with time travel, which can be appreciated even more on a second viewing.Young performers Radcliffe and Grint continue their fine work, but the revelation this time is Watson's portrayal of the smart, assertive Hermione, a character who provides inspiration for young women in the audience and young actresses as well. There's been some talk of bringing on newer, younger child stars for future episodes, but I'd like to see these three actors take the characters into at least their late teens.As for the older players, there seems to be an endless supply of great British character actors who can be called upon to fill any vacancies among the Hogwarts staff. New for this outing is Gambon who capably fills the Dumbledorean robes of the late Richard Harris; Thompson as the hilariously nearsighted tea-leaf reading Sybill Trelawney; Thewlis as Professor Lupin, the Dark Arts Defense teacher with a suspicious surname; and Oldman as the dreaded Sirius Black who is in dogged pursuit of Harry.Shot in England and Scotland, the look of the film complements the mystical material very well, while the computer graphics, animation and the other cinematic 'magic' add to an enjoyable experience for the entire family.",9,0,1,16 July 2009
Tropic Thunder," Hollywood extras fire real bullets!
","Java Man Reviews 'Tropic Thunder' (Rated R) Directed by Ben Stiller. Written by Justin Theroux, Etan Cohen & Ben Stiller. Starring Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Brandon T. Jackson, Bill Hader, Matthew McConaughey, Brandon Soo Hoo and a surprise actor. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com September, 2008.OVERVIEW:A troupe of actors (Stiller, Black, Downey, Jr., Baruchel & Jackson) are led into the jungle by pretentious director Damien Cockburn (Coogan) to make a Vietnam war movie. Along for the shoot are cynical screenwriter Four Leaf Tayback (Nolte), explosives expert Cody (McBride) and a full crew of Hollywood tech types. When a mishap sidelines Cockburn, Stiller's character takes over and stages the scenes as if the cameras were still rolling (he thinks there are hidden cameras filming their every move). As they blunder further into the jungle, the extras playing the enemy are actually a gang of drug runners who are returning fire with real bullets, led by the scariest 12-year old drug lord you will ever see (Hoo). As the rumble in the jungle heats up, Hollywood heavyweights back home are trying to figure out what's happening. An agent (McConaughey), a studio executive (see if you can guess), and his obsequious assistant (Hader) fret over the possibility that the cast and crew may die . . . or, worse yet, the studio may lose money.REVIEW: 3 1/2 out of 4 Java MugsThe film opens with three fake movie trailers and a concession ad featuring several of the lead actors. These little comic gems help establish the characters while also revealing the filmmakers intentions... to satirize Hollywood movies, Hollywood culture, and yes, Hollywood's audiences (us). The fact that many in attendance at our preview screening actually thought these were trailers for real movies only proves the point that many movies are ridiculous, yet we pay to see them anyway. Some even said they wish the movies they advertised were real. Jack Black in an Eddie Murphy-like fat suit? Why not? The movie satirizes all things Hollywood, from self-important actors and outrageous executives to nearly every war movie ever made.Six of this film's actors are big-name stars who have had leading roles in their own successful movies, yet they work as an effective ensemble under Stiller's inspired direction. You may not recognize one of them, and you will swear another is not who the credits say he is. But that's all part of the fun!Perhaps the best of the group is Downey Jr. as a Russell Crowe-like Australian actor who takes 'The Method' so seriously that he actually becomes his character--a streetwise African American (complete with surgically altered skin color). Of course the troupe also includes a real black actor-rapper named Alpa Chino (Jackson) who becomes hilariously aggravated by the Downey character's outrageous blackness.There are plenty of gory scenes, but even they are part of the satire, and are exposed for what they are--blood & guts special effects. Hawaii is used successfully as a stand-in for the unnamed location that itself is masquerading as Vietnam.Getting back to fake movie trailers, this film, along with Quentin Tarantino's and Robert Rodriguez's Grindhouse (2007) has helped spawn The International Fake Trailer Festival, part of the International Film Festival of Catalonia in Spain. You can upload your fake trailer to teaserland.com.",8,1,4,26 September 2008
The Duchess," Come for Princess Di, stay for Georgiana
","Java Man Reviews 'The Duchess' (Rated PG-13). Directed by Saul Dibb. Written by Jeffrey Hatcher, Anders Thomas Jensen and Dibb, based on the book by Amanda Foreman. Starring Keira Knightley, Ralph Fiennes, Charlotte Rampling, Dominic Cooper, Hayley Atwell, Simon McBurney and Aiden McArdle. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com November, 2008.OVERVIEW:As the movie opens, 17-year-old Georgiana Spenser (Knightley) is playfully teasing Charles Grey (Cooper), the budding politician who is smitten with her and remains so for the rest of the film. In the meantime, her status-conscious mother (Rampling) is arranging her marriage to William Cavendish, The Duke of Devonshire (Fiennes), a boorish nabob whose only obsessions are his dogs and his desire to produce a male heir. Once married, the young Duchess is treated like chattel and only receives husbandly attention as it relates to acquiring a son. Nevertheless, her irrepressible spirit and inherent wit propel her to notoriety among London's liberal elite. She supports the American and French Revolutions and is an ardent campaigner for Whig politicians such as future Prime Minister Charles Fox (McBurney). She also turns out to be a gifted fashion designer, one who wears dresses today that others will wear tomorrow. But she lives in an age where women have few rights, and this sets the stage for the kinds of conflicts that are a playwright's delight.REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java MugsFrom a leather-clad warrior-queen in King Arthur to a skinny soccer star in Bend it Like Beckham, Keira Knightley has dazzled her way through centuries of British history. And she is only 23. With her recent period pieces Pride & Prejudice and Atonement, one might declare: 'Oh no, not another costumer with Keira!'But this one is different (and just as good), because the compelling story involves real people, including the title character who is an ancestor of Diana Spenser, the late Princess of Wales. In fact, the plight of the 18th century Georgiana echoes that of 20th century Diana: a young girl marries a much older blue-blood with disastrous results. And, remember that play you read in English class, The School for Scandal? The marriage satirized by Richard Brinsley Sheridan is that of his contemporaries, the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire.The casting is dead-on. In addition to Knightley, who is near-perfect, Atwell is beguiling as the Duke's 'other wife,' while Fiennes manages to maintain interest in a character with few redeeming qualities. The supporting roles provide additional richness, including Rampling's ambitious matron, McBurney's insinuating Fox, and McArdle's subversive Sheridan. Least satisfying is Cooper as Earl Grey, the future Prime Minister (who had a tea named after him). Inspired costuming along with Britain's best castles and estates are put to good use to take the audience back in time.Princess Diana may bring in the audiences, but they will stay for Georgiana.",7,1,2,7 November 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," More of a ballet than a bloodbath
","Like Welles and Fellini before him, Tarantino eschews chronological order in telling this martial arts tale of revenge. Not only does he follow his Western masters but also the Eastern filmmakers who have greatly influenced him. The fact that one of the major characters is of Chinese, Japanese and American lineage is no accident. It seems that Tarantino has made a movie that pays tribute to every action film he has ever seen.But much of Tarantino's strength resides in his writing, as evidenced by his first three outings (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown), at least two of which are destined to be classics. In this movie the writing seems overwhelmed by the action, though the film still contains some very good lines.But this is only Volume 1, and we don't even know what the main character's backstory is yet. Tarantino has Volume 2 to fill in some of the missing motivation as well as display his formidable writing and character development skills. With that, we may have another film classic to be. Or at least a glorious B-film masterpiece.As for performances, the cast comes up with some great ones. Thurman, who is in nearly every scene, excels in a role that must have been extremely exhausting. She does away with more opponents in one scene than Eastwood ever piled up in all of his spaghetti westerns. Liu is especially effective as the ruthless gang lord who runs Tokyo, and who gives vivid meaning to the expression, 'heads will roll.'As for the violence, the style is such that it is not that upsetting. By the end of the film, it is so stylized that it has become more of a ballet than a bloodbath. The scenes that are the most disturbing in subject matter are presented in Anime, the most stylized of all the filmic forms. I'm not saying that no one will be offended, but this is what the R rating is for.Music is very creatively used, one example being what sounded to me like a Salsa number that heralds a snowy battle scene in Japan.Does this break the rules? You bet. And that is why we love this guy.",9,0,0,20 May 2020
The Dark Knight," Good and evil are easy to spot . . . in a comic book
","Java Man Reviews 'The Dark Knight' (PG-13) Directed by Christopher Nolan. Written by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. Starring Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman & Morgan Freeman. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com November, 2008.OVERVIEW:Once again it is time for all of the good people of Gotham City to marshal its forces against the architects of evil. On the side of good are Batman/Bruce Wayne (Bale), District Attorney Dent (Eckhart), Assistant D.A. Dawes (Gyllenhaal) and career cop Gordon (Oldman). The allies of evil include the city's crime kingpins and the satanically sinister Joker (Ledger). Good and evil are easy to spot . . . in a comic book. But in the noirish world created by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan, things get complicated--and interesting. Is Batman a hero? Or is he an outside-the-law vigilante? The joker gets his jollies by pitting the so-called good characters against each other as he creates one ethical dilemma after another. For example, two ferry-loads of passengers are placed in a position where they must decide to blow up the other boat before they get incinerated themselves. What would you do? By the end of the film good and evil have kept themselves well-hidden, behind a veil of ethical and moral ambiguity.REVIEW: 4 out of 4 Java Mugs!With a cast of characters who originated on the pages of a comic book one might expect simplistic storytelling and cardboard characters. This film is any thing but, because it transcends its source in a way that The Godfather films outclass the pulp novels they were based upon. Compelling dialog immediately pulls us into the narrative, just as the characters find themselves drawn into the complex chaos of human existence. The Joker's nonstop patter is a perfect example: In addition to his usual wisecracks and witticisms, he spouts such surprisingly complex comments that a psychology major might start taking notes. But its not just the dialog, it's the late Heath Ledger's inspired performance that makes the Joker such a memorable character. He may win a posthumous Oscar. Though not as dominating as Ledger's, other performances are extremely effective. Bale's deep-voiced, brooding Batman reveals how similar these polar opposites really are. 'You complete me' the Joker informs Batman at one point. Eckhart, Gyllenhaal and Oldman are quite convincing as the crime-fighting trio who try to bring the bad guys to bay. Significant supporting work is turned in by Oscar-winners Caine and Freeman as Batman's worldly wise backups. The technical aspects of the film are flawless. Many scenes have been shot with Imax cameras and Chicago is magnificently cast as Gotham. Well-executed chase scenes and other action sequences perfectly match the film's somber tone. Obvious CGI is kept at a minimum, and everything seems to be happening on the mean streets of Gotham, rather than on a hard drive of a computer. As of this writing, The Dark Knight is the second-highest grossing film of all time, just 50 million or so behind Titanic. This is a much better movie, so let's get out to the theater and pass that sinking ship, $8.00 at a time.",10,4,9,22 November 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," A little less clever, a little more complicated.
","Java Man Reviews 'Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix' (2007, PG-13). Directed by David Yates. Written by Michael Goldenberg, based on the novel by J.K. Rowling. Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Imelda Staunton, Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters, Katie Leung, Evanna Lynch & Brendan Gleeson. Running Time: 138 minutes. This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW: Harry (Radcliffe) is about to begin his fifth year at the Hogwarts when he and his cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors. In desperation he uses a secret spell to defeat them, thus breaking one of the wannabe wizards' prime directives--no magic outside the gates of the paranormal prep school. In danger of being expelled, Harry finds himself in the middle of a power struggle between Albus Dumbledore (Gambon) and the new Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge (Staunton), who has been sent by the Ministry to discredit Harry's nightmare-inspired warnings of a major threat from Lord Voldemort (Fiennes). Since Umbridge's curriculum is inadequate to the task of doing battle with Voldemort and his minions, Harry and his cohorts in conjuring (Grint and Watson) secretly form an underground revolutionary force they call Dumbledore's army. As they train for conflicts to come, they must also keep themselves hidden from the appalling Ms. Umbridge.REVIEW: 3 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS In this, the fifth of the Harry Potter film series, the characters have become a little less clever and a little more complicated, and so has the movie itself.The idea of a school year passing has been lost, and so have the fascinating intrigues and rivalries among student and faculty factions. The only one doing any teaching is Harry, as he readies his band of wand-wielding rebels for an epic struggle with the forces of evil.The three leads are still quite attractive, but most of the acting burden is put on Radcliffe's shoulders, and he succeeds quite well. Grint's character is given short shrift, while Watson is growing up fast and may soon be angling for adult roles. Cho Chang (Leung) gives Harry his first kiss, but doesn't really register as a character. Luna Lovegood (Lynch), on the other hand, is the most intriguing of the younger newcomers and steals the few scenes she is in.Of the adult additions to the cast, the most welcome is Bonham Carter who boils and bubbles as Bellatrix Lestrange, gleefully channeling all three of Macbeth's witches. The series continues to be a virtual pension program for acting legends the likes of Brendan Gleeson, Fiona Shaw, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters and the great Maggie Smith. The best of these is Alan Rickman, who has been given a few silly lines, but delivers them like he is auditioning for Lear or Hamlet.The technical aspects of the film remain at the highest level, and are now taken for granted in a series that has been so effectively innovative. The filmmakers' ability to create a world as imaginative as Rowling's is the main reason nearly all of the book's fan's are also fans of the films.",7,0,0,9 October 2007

They go to the Louvre where Langdon's friend and colleague, museum curator Jacques Sauniere (Marielle), has been murdered by an Albino monk (Bettany). Before he dies, however, he manages to carve religious symbols into his skin and scrawl anagrams on the parquet floor with his own blood. Also at the scene is the department's Cryptologist, Sophie Neveu (Tautou), who warns Langdon that Fache is about to arrest him for the murder. The two escape and begin a complex quest to find the meaning of Sauniere's symbols, the identity of his killer, the mysterious men he works for and the location of the ultimate Macguffin: The Holy Grail.REVIEW: 2 1/2 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGSOpus Dei is a Catholic organization, like the Knights of Columbus. But instead of sponsoring bingo games and holding raffles, they evidently busy themselves with 2,000-year old conspiracies that involve Albino monks, shadowy Cardinals, the Priories of Scion, Knights Templar and, of course, that naughty Mary Magdalene.Because of its highly symbolic and mysterious liturgy, and because it is the oldest continuously operating institution on earth, the Catholic Church is an easy target for conspiracy theories. And some feel that this movie, and the pot boiler of a novel upon which it is based, might give offense to the Church's hierarchy. The truth is, the plot is far too ludicrous for anyone to take seriously. The group that should be most upset are art historians, who may cringe when McKellen's character manipulates Da Vinci's The Last Supper as though he were using the latest update of Photoshop.But a preposterous plot can be overcome by appealing actors portraying characters who involve us in the action. This is nearly achieved by the supporting performances of McKellen as the eccentric liturgist, Reno as the suspicious cop, and Bettany as the creepy Albino. But ultimately it is the leads who let us down and fail to provide the steam needed to keep the pot boiling. Tautou tries hard, but Hanks is far too remote to even register as a complete character.Technically, the film is brilliant, with fascinating European locations, suitably sinister interiors, sweeping cinematography, and sharp-eyed editing. An example of Howard's cutting technique is a chase scene that takes place in the Louvre. As Hanks and Tautou dash through the Da Vinci gallery, Howard cuts several times to details from Leonardo's masterpieces; these powerful images seem to come to life and briefly become characters themselves. The problem, of course, is that inanimate works of art become more fascinating than the living characters rushing past them.A pretty picture without personality is like Mona Lisa without her smile.",6,4,8,17 November 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Wizards: On-screen and behind it too
","Java Man Reviews 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com December, 2001.OVERVIEW: As an infant, Harry Potter (Radcliffe) was deposited on the doorstep of his mean aunt and uncle, and has been living with them and sleeping in a cupboard below the stairs. On his 11th birthday he learns that he's a wizard when he's invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. Once he arrives at the paranormal prep school he becomes friends with the clever Hermione (Watson) and the courageous Ron (Grint). He also encounters the hilariously outlandish instructors (Harris, Smith, Rickman and Hart) and the gruff but gentle groundskeeper (Coltrane). While Harry and his friends compete with the other houses on campus, they are also drawn into an adventure involving a mysterious wizard who wants to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. The courage and cleverness of his friends rubs off on Harry and, as the movie ends, his life as a young wizard is... just beginning. REVIEW: 3 1/2 of 4 Java Mugs The movie version of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series has been long awaited by young readers and their parents, and they won't be disappointed. The screenplay is quite faithful to the book and is fascinating enough to hold any audience's attention despite the 2 1/2 hour length. Episodes are strung together without much transition or explanation but this is a minor fault, since it allows that much more of the story to reach the screen. The dialogue is fast paced and witty, with plenty of high-spirited humor.Some of the movie's best lines come from Coltrane's character who keeps amazing himself by revealing secrets he is supposed to keep. Radcliffe admirably inhabits Harry's trademark eyeglasses and closely matches the visual image that has emerged from the buzz around book series. As the character closest to 'normal,' he is our guide into the movie's weird and wonderful world. Watson and Grint are also delightful as his cohorts in conjuring. The witches and wizards who run the arcane academy are played with enormous relish by some of the best British actors at work today, led by Harris, Rickman, Hart and Smith (who, like Jean Brodie, seems forever in her prime).There are wizards off-screen, too -- those in charge of bringing key episodes to life. Lavish cinematography and imaginative set design capture the central images of the book, including the high-flying Quidditch match (played on turbo-powered broomsticks) and the crucial Wizard's chess match. Computer visuals are combined with actual locations to give the setting a sort of realistic unreality. John Williams' superb score further enlivens many of the key scenes. And there's more to come. Kloves has already written the screenplay for the second installment and is currently adapting the third novel, while Rowling is about to publish her fifth book in the series.",9,0,1,16 July 2009
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," No dragons were harmed during the filming of this movie
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Reviewed by Terry 'Java Man' Meehan Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com December, 2005.OVERVIEW The film opens in a large stadium where the Quidditch World Cup is in progress, and Ireland and Bulgaria are about to take to their brooms. As Harry and his pals (Radcliffe, Grint & Watson) are about to enjoy the spectacle, the stadium is attacked by a hoard of Klan-like pointy heads known as the Death Eaters -- minions of the feared Lord Voldemort (Fiennes), the arch-fiend who will be Potter's likely nemesis for the balance of the series. The Death Eaters are repelled, for now, and so its back to Hogwarts for the film's main storyline... the Triwizard Tournament. The other two competing schools are the husky, pumped-up boys from Durmstrang and the lithe and lovely girls from Beauxbaton. The imaginative arrival of the visiting teams sets the exciting tone for the rest of the film. The Goblet of Fire chooses the finalists -- one from each school -- each of whom must be at least 17 years old. As wide-eyed, 14-year old Harry looks on, he is astonished that the Goblet spits out an unprecedented fourth name... his. As Harry battles dragons and Death Eaters through mazes and lagoons, he must face up to the most daunting challenge of all... getting a date to the Triwizard Ball.REVIEW: 3 1/2 Java Mugs out of 4 If Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry were located anywhere in the real world, it would be forced to close its doors by protesting parents and outraged lawmakers. But,thankfully, the paranormal prep school exists in the imagination of author J.K. Rowling, and in our own collective imagination, thanks to Klove's bewitching screen writing and Newell's wizardly direction.Though some of the miniature sets are given away by hasty camera moves, the film's production design more than adequately creates a wondrous world where witches and warlocks can live and work. England and Scotland provide stunning exteriors, while an endless supply of British prep schools contribute fascinating interiors.The spine of the story, the Triwizard competition, is compelling and easy to follow, even for those unfamiliar with Rowling's rambling prose. Some younger viewers, however, may cringe at the scarier scenes, and thus the PG-13 rating. Subplots abound, and add immensely to the film's entertainment value... Coltrane's giant Hagrid finally finds romance with the even taller headmistress of Beauxbaton; and the 14-year-old leads agonize over how to get dates for the Triwizard Ball.Radcliffe gives his best performance yet, and Watson continues to blossom into a sexy-smart scene stealer. The supporting cast is once again a who's who of a seemingly never-ending pool of Irish-English master actors and actresses. Especially welcome is the addition of Gleeson as 'Mad Eye' Moody, the professor who teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts. His quick-pan, zoom-lens eye can spot a student goof-off from across the commons. Though Smith has fewer scenes this go-around, her Jean Brodie-esquire comment to a fellow faculty member is one of the funniest lines in the film.This is a cinematic treat for anyone, young or old. And, you'll be happy to know, according to the credits that 'no dragons were harmed during the filming of this movie.'",9,0,1,16 July 2009
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," More magic from the paranormal prep school
","Java Man Reviews 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' (Rated PG) Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com December, 2002.OVERVIEW In this, the second of a planned series of seven films, a strange creature named Dobby visits Harry Potter (Radcliffe) while Harry is at home on summer vacation with the dastardly Dursleys. The 'house elf' warns Harry that a deadly new menace--one that turns students to stone--is wreaking havoc on his beloved Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. With his friends Ron and Hermione (Grint and Watson), Harry returns to Hogwarts and begins to search for the Chamber of Secrets, where he hopes to locate and destroy the source of the evil. According to legend, a strange serpent stands guard at the chamber door, but Harry must also contend with a diary that writes itself, evildoers from Hogwarts' past and suspicious characters who turn up in all corners of the paranormal prep school.REVIEW: 3 of 4 Java MugsNear the beginning of the movie, we are flying over an extraordinary complex of buildings that seem to be made up of well-carved, picturesque miniatures. As the camera moves closer, however, we actually enter a full-sized room and have magically arrived at Hogwarts School, thanks to one of the many compelling visual devices employed by the filmmakers.The faculty and staff at Hogwarts remain deliciously eccentric, played by British film legends such as Oscar winner Maggie Smith and the late Richard Harris. But the ones to watch are the three cohorts in conjuring who lead us through the halls of Hogwarts to places we never thought could exist. New to the cast is Dobby, a computer generated house elf, and Branagh, a hapless teacher of the dark arts. Dobby is far less annoying that Stars Wars' infamous Jar-Jar Binks; Branagh, unfortunately, is not.Topnotch production design and cinematography combine with slick editing and well-orchestrated action scenes to provide a fast-paced, sumptuous visual feast.Can the cast and crew keep it up for seven films? Rowling is still writing and her fans are still buying the books and the movie tickets.",8,0,1,16 July 2009
The Departed," Scorsese's Oscar and this film's ending: as inevitable as a Greek Tragedy.
","Java Man Reviews 'The Departed' (2006, R). Directed by Martin Scorsese. Written by William Monahan. Starring Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Vera Farmiga. Running Time: 151 minutes This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW: Martin Scorsese, perhaps today's greatest living director, guides his grip truck through the mean streets again, this time steering into the Irish-American neighborhoods of South Boston. The first stop is the Massachusetts State Police induction ceremony, where two young recruits have earned their badges and are beginning their careers as cops. Ambitious Colin Sullivan (Damon) gets assigned to an elite investigative unit whose purpose is to bring down local crime boss Frank Costello (Nicholson).Street-smart but hot-headed Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) soon gets booted off the force and ends up as a confidant to the corrupt Costello. Screenwriter Monaghan quickly reveals that each man is actually a mole working for the other side, thus freeing Scorsese to dispense with suspense and get right to the exploration of these two complex characters. Along the way they are joined by other macho lawmen played by the likes of Sheen, Baldwin and Wahlberg. Adding a welcome female presence is Madolyn (Farmiga), a fascinatingly inept therapist who manages to develop a too-close-to-the-couch relationship with both Costigan and Sullivan. Scorsese and his crew build up the tension to its inevitable conclusion, which is reminiscent of Greek tragedy.REVIEW: 4 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS Early in the film, Colin Sullivan is being tempted from his youthful paradise by Frank Costello, king of the Boston underworld. Young Colin is played by a young actor, but there is no attempt to portray Costello as a younger man. This is one Scorsese's genius strokes. We immediately realize that Nicholson's Costello is ageless, just as Satan and his evil intentions are ageless. This is Nicholson's best scene and as the film progresses, he slips in and out of character (and Southy dialect) as he wanders between previous personas from The Shining and Batman.But that's no problem because this film has so much acting talent that it doesn't even need Jack in top form. DiCaprio and Damon give career-best performances, while such pros as Sheen and Baldwin do superlative supporting work. The most pleasant surprise comes from Wahlberg who is a revelation, and should have Mr. Scorsese direct all of his films. It has been noted that the former bad-boy based his character on a real-life Boston police officer who arrested him several times during his wayward youth. Farmiga, in the only prominent female role, capably keeps her head above water in this tidal wave of testosterone.The devil is in the details (so to speak) and Scorsese doesn't miss a trick. For example, Damon has a scene at a funeral where we see him with on-the-job facial injuries. Though the other characters don't notice, Scorsese's camera captures his twisted face in such a way that we see into his twisted soul. The screenplay takes the characters on a wild ride through the streets of Boston, but somehow we sense how most of them will end up--as victims of fate and inevitability.Scorsese has finally won his Oscar, as has the film itself. That, too, was inevitable.",10,2,5,20 September 2007
Wedding Crashers," Wedding Crashers of Old
","Java Man Reviews 'Wedding Crashers'(2005, R). Directed by David Dobkin. Written by Steve Faber & Bob Fisher. Starring Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams, Christopher Walken, Isla Fisher, Bradley Cooper & Jane Seymour. Running Time: 119 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com. OVERVIEW:John and Jeremy (Wilson and Vaughn) are Washington D.C. divorce counselors who spend their off-hours and vacation-breaks pursuing their real passion... wedding crashing. The rules of the game are simple: have a well-rehearsed explanation of how you are related to the bride or groom; be extra nice to the bridesmaids and other single women at the wedding; and never, NEVER fall in love with any of your conquests. Of course the One Big Rule of the movie comedy is to break such rules as soon as possible -- and sure enough, one of the guys falls in love. This happens when they crash the wedding of the daughter of Treasury Secretary Cleary (Walken), who has two other daughters (McAdams and Fisher) and a wayward wife (Seymour). Once our heroes enter the Kennedy-style Cleary compound, their cover stories begin to unravel and complications ensue.REVIEW: 2.5 Java Mugs out of 4It was 1962, and we had just finished stocking shelves on a Saturday night. 'C'mon, Terry, we're going to a wedding reception,' said my coworker Ken Skelly. 'Whose?' I asked. 'It doesn't matter,' he answered. And off we went, two 18-year-old wedding crashing pioneers. I should have written a screenplay.But a screenplay is just the beginning. What brings it to life is the imagination of the director and the talents of the actors. The talented actors we have: Wilson, Vaughn and Walken could recite the wording of a ballot issue and it would be hilarious. But somehow the film doesn't gel under Dobkin's direction. Walken for example, who normally chews up any movie he's in, seems subdued. And though Wilson and Vaughn have some sparkling moments together, their performances could have been more spontaneous. Some promising characters are left undeveloped. For example, Wilson and Seymour have a scene that echoes the great Mrs. Robinson seduction in The Graduate, but after that her character goes nowhere.Though it could have been better, the film is still fun to watch. The production design is attractive as are McAdams and Fisher, who have the comic touch as the daughters. The editing, too, is well-executed, including a musical montage that takes us through a United Nations of ethnic weddings (Greek, Italian, Indian, Irish), and ends with some fancy moves on the dance floor that transition to fanciful moves in the bedroom.Back in 1962, our wedding-crashing montage usually ended with us getting thrown out. But I would like to think that my old pal Ken perfected the technique and is still out there somewhere, crashing weddings and breaking hearts.",7,1,2,11 November 2007
WALL·E," Star Baby to Sprout: A Cinematic Odyssey
","Java Man Reviews WALL-E (Rated G) Directed by Andrew Stanton. Written by Stanton & Jim Reardon. With Fred Willard and the voices of Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight, Jeff Garlin, John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy & Sigourney Weaver. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com August, 2008.OVERVIEW:Earth has been abandoned for centuries and all that remains is a robot and his sidekick cockroach (you knew nothing could kill them). WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-class) is a mobile trash compactor who continues to do his job decades after his inventors have lifted off for outer space. The humans, now obese and obtuse, live on Axiom, a continuously orbiting spaceship run by computers and machines who cater to their every need. The humans just sit around with drinks and watch video screens . . . like now.WALL-E doesn't compact everything. He keeps a collection of human artifacts, including his own spare parts, an old VHS of Hello Dolly (1969), and a little green plant. It's that little green plant that sets the plot in motion and attracts the attention of EVE, the Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator who comes to Earth to see if there are signs of life that may enable the floating humans to return to terra firma. WALL-E falls in love with EVE, having been programmed in the art of romance by thousands of viewings of Dolly. Meanwhile, competing powers aboard Axiom threaten the little green life form, and a battle begins for the survival of humankind.REVIEW: 4 out of 4 Java Mugs!Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) was the first film to marry film-making technique with computer technology. That was 40 years ago and technology has come a long way . . . yet the narratives of the two films are remarkably similar: They each take us on a journey far into outer space, only to discover that the meaning of existence lies in simple concepts: a newborn baby or a budding sprout. 'It's not in our stars, but in ourselves.'While these may be serious themes for a G-rated movie, you don't have to be an existential philosopher or a Shakespeare scholar to enjoy this film. Kid's will love it, and so will you.In addition to Kubrick's masterpiece, WALL-E alludes to other great moments in cinema history. The first 40-minutes contains no dialogue and calls to mind the touching and poetic work of silent film geniuses Chaplin and Keaton. The Alien sci-fi series is also evoked, complete with a Sigourney Weaver voice cameo.Though it pays homage to other great movies, WALL-E is one of the most original films ever made, with an originality that is expressed in its inventive look, resourceful sound and vibrant characterization. An example is the creation of the lead robots. They speak precious few words but each character's ingenious visual design is combined with the amusing sounds they give off to express a range of emotions so wide that many human actors might feel upstaged.In his 2008 documentary, Encounters at the End of the World, Werner Herzog comments that 'the human presence on this planet is not really sustainable,' an idea not totally hidden behind WALL-E's optimistic sheen. According to New York Times critic A. O. Scott, 'When the whimsical techies at Pixar and a moody German auteur are sending out the same message, it may be time to pay attention.'Pay attention, but enjoy it too.",10,0,2,15 August 2008
Iron Man," Robert Downey, Jr. makes a great Iron(y) Man
","Java Man Reviews 'Iron Man' (Rated PG-13). Directed by Jon Favreau. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Leslie Bibb, Shaun Toub, Faran Tahir & Clark Gregg. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com June, 2008.OVERVIEW: Brilliant, arrogant Tony Stark (Downey) heads a corporation that makes sophisticated weapons systems for the U.S. military. A latter-day Howard Hughes, he inherited Stark Industries from his father and runs it with his dad's partner Obadiah Stane (Bridges). Like Hughes, Stark is rarely seen without a drink in his hand or a woman on his arm. Also like Hughes, he is a technological genius who can build a first-rate robot with parts lying around your garage.On a sales trip to Afghanistan, Stark is ambushed and captured by Taliban types who confine him to a cave and force him to formulate an ultimate weapon. Instead, he creates a makeshift suit of armor which enables him to escape into the desert. When he arrives back home, Tony is a changed man and decides to renounce his arms business. This sends the firm's stock into a tailspin and arouses the ire of Obadiah who wants to keep selling weapons to war zones, preferably to both sides. Always unpredictable, Tony begins fashioning a more sophisticated version of his jerry-rigged armor suit and begins to attract the attention of his pal at the Pentagon, Jim Rhodes (Howard). Keeping Tony organized during all of this is Pepper Potts (Paltrow), his highly competent assistant who may also be secretly smitten by her boss.REVIEW: 3 1/2 out of 4 Java Mugs: Early in the film, Tony shows up late for the take-off of his private plane with this excuse... 'I got stuck doing a piece for Vanity Fair.' This line, which has more than one meaning (you'll see), is a good example of how well the script is written, and how well Downey inhabits the complex character created for him. Tony's irresponsible lifestyle as well as an intensity and drive that characterizes an action hero are both alive and well in Downey's inspired performance.While Downey decants large drafts of his public persona into his flawed hero, the other actors remain expertly in character. Bridges, Howard and Paltrow, all with previous Oscar nods, have memorable scenes brilliantly performed. Paltrow is especially appealing, doing her best work since Shakespeare in Love.But what is all this talk about a character and performance? This is, after all, a super-hero action movie. The title is Iron Man, not Irony Man. Some of these serious method actors will be flying around in metal suits by the second act. The answer is... we're attracted to movies with interesting characters, especially ones who can remain interesting even while wearing a junkyard's worth of metalBut if you're a fan of flying steel and fiery explosions, don't worry... You won't find this film wanting. The action sequences, and there are plenty of them, are like the movie itself: witty, ironic and well-executed.This is one of the best movies of the year, so far. Though not known for their long memories, Oscar voters should make a note to take a look at this DVD toward the end of the year.",9,1,2,13 June 2008
Atonement," Briony's betrayal echoes through the decades
","Java Man Reviews 'Atonement' (Rated R). Directed by Joe Wright. Written by Christopher Hampton, based on the novel by Ian McEwan. Starring Keira Knightley, James McAvoy, Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, Vanessa Redgrave & Brenda Blethyn. Running Time: 123 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW: In this cinematic adaptation of Ian McEwan's best-seller, the filmmakers take us back to the Tallis country house in 1935 rural England. Here, 13 year-old Briony Tallis (Ronan) sees her sister Cecilia (Knightley) in a romantic embrace with Robbie Turner (McAvoy), the son of one of the family's servants (Blethyn). Because of her naivety, and her confused feelings for her sister's suitor, Briony falsely accuses the young man of committing a sex crime. The story then weaves back and forth through time, as the emotional consequences of Briony's betrayal echo through the decades. The film follows the three characters, now sadly separated, as they encounter the ravages of World War II. Brionyfirst as a young war-time nurse (Garai) and later as an elderly woman (Redgrave)is constantly trying to find a way to atone for her unforgivable falsehood.REVIEW: 3 Java Mugs out of 4 At the beginning of the film, young Briony taps relentlessly on a typewriter as she composes a play for her family. The rat-a-tat-tat of a typist typing continues throughout the film, and is a major component of the film's Oscar-winning score (Atonement's only win out of 7 nods), Though it threatens to become annoying, there is a reason for it; I suggest you listen to the score, and make note of what is happening on the screen when you hear the unrelenting Underwood.While the pacing of the film, especially in the opening sequences, seems slow, it does provide an opportunity to admire the exquisite art direction and set design that reveals the more leisurely lifestyle of England in the 1930s. Another reason to savor these slower scenes is to take pleasure in the appeal of Knightley, McAvoy and Ronan before their characters are overwhelmed by the harsh realities of war. Briony has three actors who define her complex character... Ronan and Redgrave who are brilliant, and Garai who gives a more conventional, less compelling portrayal.The film's pace quickens as World War II approaches. In one remarkable scene, director Wright sets up a five-minute continuous tracking shot at Dunkirk Beach as the British soldiers are preparing to sail back to England. The moving camera captures the reality of war and its surreal elements as we follow Robbie past bombed-out buildings, burning boats, horses being shot and a performing choir. This is one of the best scenes of the year, and should take its place among such famous film feats as Orson Welles' opening shot in Touch of Evil (1958) and Robert Altman's homage to Welles in The Player (1992).",8,0,1,11 April 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," ' . . . and the Oscar goes to . . . HOMER!'
","Java Man Reviews 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' (2000, PG-13). Directed by Joel Coen. Written by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen. Starring George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman and Holly Hunter. Running Time: 103 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW: During the 1930s, Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) and two of his prison pals, Pete and Delmar (Turturro and Nelson) escape from a Mississippi chain gang and embark upon a Depression era odyssey. While their primary goal is to locate an elusive buried treasure, Ulysses is also eager to return to his long-neglected wife, Penny (Hunter). Along the way, the trio's exploits parallel those of the hero of Homer's hexameters: They meet a blind prophet who guides their journey, a one-eyed brute (Cyclops) who thwarts it, and seductive sirens who pleasantly divert it. As the journey continues, ancient Greek mythology merges with modern American myth, with the landscape yielding up fabled characters from our own time, including outlaw George Nelson ('Don't call me Baby Face!') and blues legend Robert Johnson (who sold his soul at the crossroads in exchange for guitar-playing genius.) Like the Odyssey, this movie moves magnificently toward an action-packed conclusion.REVIEW: 4 STARS OUT OF 4' . . . and the Oscar goes to . . . HOMER!' Though the Academy doesn't give out awards to 2,800-year-old epic poets, this film was nominated for best-adapted screenplay, with the 'material previously published' being Homer's Odyssey. In earlier years, the Academy has given awards for original story, and once engraved a statuette for George Bernard Shaw for 1938's Pygmalion. (A bit of trivia: Shaw is the only person to have won both a Nobel Prize for Literature and an Oscar.) Whether it's Homer, Shakespeare, Shaw or the Coen Brothers, great stories make great movies.But the Coens ransack more than just Homer. The title of this film comes from Preston Sturges' 1941 classic, Sullivan's Travels, in which the title character wants to make a serious film, and has titled it 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' And of course, Sullivan's Travels, pays homage to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, which in turn looks back to Homer's Odyssey. The performances also run back and forth through time. At the center of it is Clooney who plays Ulysses like the reincarnation of Clark Gable, even down to the well-trimmed mustache. One of today's big stars plays one of yesterday's big stars playing a character whose first name is the Latin version of Odysseus. Again, it all comes back to Homer and his seminal story.Coen regulars also portray a parade of quirky characters. Goodman is intimidating as the one-eyed Bible thumper who parallels Homer's Cyclops. (Look for him too in a hilarious Ku Klux Klan scene where his sheet has only one eye hole.) As the poet's Penelope, Hunter embodies a more modern, less constant version of wifely virtue, with seven daughters and little patience for her absent husband. Turturro is completely submerged in the pensive character of Pete, while Nelson's deadpan Delmar is performed with perfect comic timing. Even cameos were played to perfection, such as Stephen Root's blind radio station owner.Roger Deakins' Oscar-nominated cinematography provides generous views of the Mississippi countryside, adding to the film's epic quality. The music, which both the characters and the filmmakers take seriously, accounts for much of the movie's spirit. The twangy tunes were put together by a collaboration of some of today's finest folk musicians, including T-Bone Burnett and Gillian Welch.Like epic poetry, film can carry us beyond the horizon, beyond hard times, to a place where the spirit of the Odyssey and the spirit of the American dream become one.",10,1,2,17 September 2007
