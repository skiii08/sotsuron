United 93," An Overdue Expose of a Soulless, Unhumanitarian Cult
","Extremist Moslems - and they make up the majority of all Moslems today -hate us and have dedicated themselves to destroying our cultures, our societies and our persons - and by 'us' I mean anyone and everyone who has not embraced Islam as the only true religion and who has not accepted Mohammad as God's true prophet (the Messiah, in other words). This includes Christians, Jews, and the great Eastern religions: Hinduism, Buddism, and Shinto. Their bible (the Koran) urges and encourages them to convert we 'nonbelievers' into good Moslems; but if we refuse to do so, they are obligated - on pain of religious anathema and banishment for heresy - to pursue us and to slay us. So they hate us and wish to destroy us because this is what their religion mandates, and this is why they feel so sacrosanct in committing their dastardly acts of mass murder in the name of 'the Prophet, Blessed Be He.' These themes are brilliantly brought out in the film and make it quite clear that there is only one solution to the Moslem 'problem.' We must kill them in greater numbers, at faster rates, than they do us, so that we can destroy their economic infrastructures, their livelihoods, and bring them to their knees economically such that they are ready to throw their Korans into the trash and listen to entreaties from us to conduct themselves as decent human beings and to finally learn that in order to survive, one must accept one's fellow human beings for what they are - and for what they are not.",10,2,6,13 October 2006
