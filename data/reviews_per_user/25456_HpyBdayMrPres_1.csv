Deja Vu," Val Kilmer-small supporting role....why?
","Val Kilmer is a great actor. Denzel is also wonderful at his craft. I must admit I went to see this film because of Kilmer. With his sharp timing, amazing array of dialects, and general acting ability, he could have added so much to this typical Hollywood action flick, that would actually make it unique, intriguing, different. I'm surprised his role was only supporting, and his character wasn't exactly imperative to the film. While he did a fine job, I can't understand why he took the job. He is aging, and its noticeable, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't take on more interesting and bigger roles. Wish he'd get some better roles in the future!",5,1,2,8 December 2006
