Requiem for a Dream," great film
",I saw this movie one night with two friends of mine. One had seen this flick before and the other was like me and had no idea what they were getting into. So we watched it. Once it started we didn't say anything to each other until it was over. It blew me away. I was pretty depressed when the movie ended and didn't get much sleep that night. This movie will make you think twice about doing drugs. I have no idea if that is what he was going after or not. All in all though it was very well put together and very well done. This movie would probably be catagorized as a drama. I recommend this movie. If you liked PI you will probably like this movie. They are both very good. 9 out of 10.,9,0,1,8 December 2004
Monty Python's Life of Brian," very funny
","This is Pythons second movie and just as good as the first although i prefer holy grail (which is why this got a 9) Very funny stuff this is about Brian who was born in the stable next to Jesus Christ. We follow him and laugh all the way to the end. We used to joke that this was the story of my life because my name is Brian, but i am not as funny as the boysfrom Monty Python. If you enjoy anything by python you will like this. Great movie full of laughs. Worth a rental to new comers to python. Highly recommended film. great for anyone who enjoys large amounts of humor. Some say this is blasphemy but i don't think so. Check this movie out. great 9 out of ten stars. hilarious",9,7,19,8 December 2004
Wayne's World," great movie
",I think that this is one of the best movies that has sprung from SNL. Mike Meyers and Dana Carvery are hilarious throughout. If you have yet to see this movie go and check it out. I live on the south side of Chicago and can tell you that it is very well portrayed in the film. Also after you see this movie you will never listen to Bohemian Rhapsody the same way again. The movie is basically about these two guys who have a cable access TV show and they are trying to get it on a real network. The movie is just hilarious and that is it. If you like either Mike or Dana or both then you will like this movie.It is great. So go ahead and laugh you butt of to this one eight out of ten stars.,8,0,1,30 December 2004
Kickboxer," pretty good movie
",this is the one of my favorite van dam movies. I think that it is also one of his best films. We watch his character train throughout the movie for a fight at the end. The martial arts throughout are very well done. This is one of those films you can watch every time it is on TV. If you like martial arts movies you will probably enjoy this one. The movie though is all about the final fight. Like many other films of its type. All in all van dam is great and if you want to see a film based on the martial arts that doesn't have Druce Lee or Jackie Chan or Jet Li in it then this movie is one for you. The story is pretty simple but the fight scenes are worth it so go for it. 7 out of 10.,7,38,47,30 December 2004
Rocky V," poignant
",This movie is very different than the others in the series but it is pretty good. If you liked the rest of the movies i would recommend this movie but if you have not seen the rest of them then do not see this one first. Although it is good it is not as good as the rest of them. We see Rocky's kid having a hard time in school so he want s to turn to fighting and the conflicts with that. This is all that i can really say without ruining the movie. Go for it if you liked the rest of the series. I didn't know what i was getting into when i rented this. I thought there was going to be more fighting in it. the final fight between rocky and the guy he was training is awesome. So it is good but not as strong as the rest of the series. 8 out of 10 This is my ranking of the series 1). Rocky 4 and Rocky 1 2). Eocky 3 3). Rocky 2 4). Rocky 5,8,13,16,16 December 2004
Blade," awesome movie
",I just recently saw this movie for the first time and all i can saw is that it is very very good. I thought that it was a great take on the classic vampire movies. Basically the story is that Blade is a vampire hunter and he is trying to rid the world of vampires. This movie has some great fight scenes in it and the special effects are very well done. I definitely recommend this movie ad if you like the matrix movies this one has the same sort of a feel to it with colors and effects and such. It is worth it to check this one out. The acting and everything are all right on I hope the other two movies are just as good. Because of how surprised i am with this movie i will give it 8 out of 10 starts.,8,0,1,16 December 2004
The Natural," Good bye Mr. Spalding
",this is my favorite movie about baseball. It is a very heart-warming story about a ballplayer and his fame. Robert Redford is great as the lead Roy Hobbs. The movie s based on the book the Natural. It is a great movie. if you haven't seen it go and see it now. It is a great movie. This is a movie that really never gets old. I can not tell you how many times i have seen it but it is still as good as the first time i saw it. The movie has some great music in it from Randy Newman. The movie is very good. If you liked the book the movie is just as good. the acting is very well done. The sets and everything really take us back into the 1930's. It is fantastic. Go and see it if you haven't nine out of ten stars.,9,0,1,16 December 2004
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Classic
","i finally rented this and i kick myself for waiting so long to see it. the movie is classic and if you love movies you should see this one. the movie is a spoof of the bomb scare and the cold war. everything about this movie is genius. although it has aged with time it is still up there in my opinion as one of the best, and definitely one of Kubricks' best. the movie is definitely funny and the plot is quite intriguing and somewhat scary. the movie though is a complete spoof and a great black comedy. the war room scenes are all classic and their plan at the end for survival is great but i am not going to spoil it for you. Kubrick did a great job of creating a classic piece of film and i highly recommend this movie to everyone.",10,2,4,24 August 2005
The Polar Express," does the book justice
",this is a feature film made about the book The Polar Express. this is one of the best films that i have seen in lately. The animation is exactly the way you see it in the book. To see the different objects in the boys room shake when the train comes by for the first time is amazing. All of the animation was very tight. there were times when i thought i was actually watching a live action movie. the storyline is right on with the book and also has a few surprises in it. My parents read this story to me many times as a child and it was great to see such a great film made out of it. Tom Hanks does a great job as the conductor and all of his other characters. Aerosmith also has a bit part in the movie which i thought was really cool. 10 out of 10,10,4,8,1 December 2004
Rocky II," Almost as good as the first one
","This movie is set right after the fight between Apollo and Rocky and leads all the way to their rematch. This one is almost as good a the first but it is sort of rehashing the same exact plot, but it is very good. If you liked the first one you will like this one. The acting is just as strong and it is overall a good movie part of a great series. I think that part two is just about as strong as the first one. It is full of action and just over all good movie. One again great performances by Sly, Tyla, Burgess and the rest of the crew. This is just plainly speaking a good movie that has a very heartwarming story. Great movie strongly recommended 9 out of 10 stars.",9,0,0,16 December 2004
The Godfather: Part II," a great sequel
",This is definitely worth your while to see if you enjoyed the first movie. It is a very good sequel to the first chapter. We see Vito Corleone's (DeNiro) past and entry into organized crime and go into the future where Michael is trying to get the family legitimate. This movie is great. Just as strong as the first movie. I think that Coppola did a great job following up on the first part. the acting is great. DeNiro does a great job portreying the character Brando created in part I. If you like mob movies go for this series. It is all about respect with this family. go for this movie after you check out the first. then after this movie get part three. all of these movies are great but this one gets 9 out of 10,9,0,2,8 December 2004
The Shining," Here's Johnny!!
","This is one of my favorite movies. I cannot remember the first time i saw it, bit let me tell you if you have not seen this movie yet you should. If you like Stanley Kuebrick or Stephen King or horror movies in general you will enjoy this movie. It has a realistic sense of horror to it. A very quick plot summary is that a family is watching a hotel over the winter season and th dad gets cabin fever and does some stuff. That is all i am going to say about it because i do not want to ruin it for you. this is a modern day classic. Jack Nicholson is amazing as the father (Jack Torrance) As are the rest of the actors. I strongly recommend this movie. ten out of then. Definitely see this one!",10,1,2,16 December 2004
Apocalypse Now," the horror
",This is one of the greatest films that i have ever seen. For some reason i waited for a long time to see this movie. I don't know why i waited so long though. If you ever had any intentions to see this movie go for it. It is amazing. I found that it was easy to get into but you have to pay attention to everything or you will miss out. I saw the Redux version with the extra footage. It was great. I was not alive during the Vietnamm War so this was a giant history lesson for me. I thought everything about it was great. I found that the colors in this movie were very vibrant it many have just been me thought. Brando was of course fabulous. Dennis Hopper was also very good in this film and Martin Sheen was amazing. Definitely check this movie out. 10-10,10,0,1,6 December 2004
Rocky IV," the best one
",This movie is the best one of the series tied with part one. It is great and for me a person who missed the US best Russia in hockey so it is great o see this. Rocky has a great speech at the end about change. It is a great movie. Watching Rocky go through his training in Russia is pretty cool and watching the Russian do his training with his hi tech equipment is cool. This movie is definitely recommended. go for it and see this one. Especially if you liked the rest of the series. The acting is very good and Dolph Lungeran as the Russian is pretty cool. Threr are few things that happened also that i haven't mentioned in this because it would ruin the movie. Great movie 10 out of 10 stars.,10,1,2,16 December 2004
The Usual Suspects," Awesome
","This is a freakin great movie. I think that this is one of the best crime movies ever. Go and see it if you ever wanted to see this movie, what are you waiting for. I was looking for something to watch a while ago and came upon this one. I turned it on and watched it twice. Kevin Spacey is excellent as Verbal. As are everyone else in the movie. It is very well put together. The movie is great. If you like crime movies you will like this movie. Full of action and just a great story all together. this is one that i have to get on DVD. I have it on VHS but i am interested to see what kind of features are on it. Definitely strongly recommended. Great movie 10 out of 10 stars. excellent.",10,0,2,16 December 2004
Batman Begins," you never learned to mind your surroundings
","This movie is fantastic. If you are a fan of Batman in any sense you will love it. Christian Bale is amazing as Batman. His acting is dead on, as is everyone else who is in it. The Scarecrow is awesome. The story is great. It goes into the past of Bruce Wayne and his training to become the Bat. It transitions greatly into a sequel which we will hopefully see soon. Hans Zimmers' score is fantastic for the film. I didn't think anyone could match Danny Elfman but he did. All of the scenery is great and is very well blended together. If in any sense you like superheroes especially Batman, I guarantee you will love this movie.",10,3,4,22 July 2005
Pi," very different but that is good
",I saw this movie a while ago and have been thinking aobout it ever since i saw it. this movie has a lot of math involved in it but it is very well done. Although the black and white got to me by the end. I found that to be surprising though because i usually do not have a problem with it. This movie has a lot to do with cracking to code of the Tora. The acting is very good in this movie. It is very good. I really do not have that much to say about it but if you have a desire to see it check it out. you probably will not be disappointed. I saw it because i had no idea what to rent one day and i saw the box and it caught my eye. Check this out if you liked Requiem for a Dream.,8,0,1,8 December 2004
Donnie Brasco," Forget about it
",This movie is based on real events. If you haven't seen this movie and you like the ' ' Gangster slash mob movies. I saw this on a recommendation and i was very pleasantly surprised. Johnny Depp is awesome as Donnie Brosco. The movie is full of action and the story is great. I strongly recommend this one. I think that it is great and i am very interested to read the book. I haven't had time yet to do so but it is definitely on my list. It is very good. The movie also stars Al Paccino who does an amazing job also. the two make a great pair together in this movie. Go for it and see this one it is great. It has a little something for everyone and i will give it eight out of ten stars.,8,1,1,16 December 2004
Rocky," Great movie
",This is a great movie. This is one of those movies i watch every time it is on. I think that Sly was made to play Rocky and the whole movie was done very well. the fight scenes are great the music is great. If you have not seen this movie you should most definitely check this one out. I think that this is probably the best one out of the five that have been made but they are all pretty good. If you want to see a great movie that deals with sports then you should see this one. It is great. I really don't know what else to tell you. It is about an underground boxer who is given a chance to win the heavy weight tile. Burgess Merrideth plays the trainer and does a fantastic job. This movie is strongly recommended. 10 out of 10,10,1,1,16 December 2004
Rocky III," One of my favorites from the series
",With part three we see rocky after he has become heavy weight champion. We also see that Mr T wants to box him for the title. There are a couple things that happen but i don't want to ruin the movie for you. i think that this one is very good it is in second place for me with parts 1 and 4 in first. If you have so far liked the series you will definitely like this one. Los of action with lots of drama in it. Go ahead and see this one you will enjoy it. All of the character are played with grace and style. If you want to see a very good drama slash action movie this one is great and you will greatly enjoy it. This movie gets nine out of ten possible starts strongly recommended.,9,0,1,16 December 2004
The Godfather: Part III," the price you pay for the life you choose

We find our Don Michael Corleone trying to get the family business legitamte and also trying to teach his nephew Vinne to become the head of the family. He also tries to get his family life back together. Lots of great [lot development in this series that is all wrapped up in this film. Great movie.

Psycho," Yes Mother
","This is an amazing horror film. The black and white makes this movie even better. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should. It is great. This movie is very interesting and there is a shot sequence at the end that is replicated in the original Halloween movie which i found very interesting. If you are a horror fan or a movie buff or both you should see this movie. It is great. I have seem it sever times and it never gets old. I still haven't found Hitchcock in it though. maybe if you watch it you will find him. Definitely worth it to check it out if you haven't seen it. Once again this movie is a classic and worth you while. Great movie from an amazing director ten out of ten.",10,1,2,10 December 2004
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," don't you wanaa watch the game Chief??
","I don't even remember the first time i saw this movie. I know that i have it on DVD and i wrote a pretty long paper on it in my English class this year. I truly believe that this lie a few other movies (Godfatehr, Citizen Kane etc) is a cinematic masterpiece. The movie is based on the book. We see Jack Nicholson as the main character, a criminal who is trying to get light work by pretending to be insane. It is a great movie and has something for everyone in it. there is humor, drama, some action. The movie is fabulous. It won a bunch of Grammys the year it came out 1975-76. Definitely check it out if you have yet to see it. For those interested in a DVD buy their is a great box set out. I love this movie ten out of ten",10,1,2,10 December 2004
Halloween," was that the boogie man
",This is my absolute favorite horror movie. It is great from start to finish. We see a lot of Hitchcock influence in this movie. This movie is great if you have yet to see it go and get it right now and watch it. You will not be disappointed. If you are considering buying this movie there is a 25th anniversary version that has a lot of extra footage on it. All in all this is definitely one of the greatest horror movies of all time if not one of the greatest movies ever. Check this out if you are a fan of movies. More creepy than scary for those who don't really like horror a fantastic movie 10 out of 10. great movie all of the actors do fantastic jobs. Donald Pleasense does a great job Once again great movie.,10,0,1,8 December 2004
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," and now on to scene twenty-four
",This is a great movie. Everyone should see this movie. I had a teacher in high school that would make their World HIstory class watch this movie. Great Idea. I unfortunately never had him but anyways this movie is one of a kind. If you like to laugh you will enjoy this movie. It is very loosely based on the movie quest for the holy grail. This movie has our dear British friends from Monty Python on a quest from God looking for the Holy Grail or the Cup of Christ (same thing) It is just a superb film great jokes. The first time I saw it i had to rewind the tape because i laughed so much. It is great check this out if you have not seem it yet 10 out of 10 I cant say enough about this movie,10,2,4,8 December 2004
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," great movie
",This is part three of the Indy trilogy. In my opinion it is the best one. It is very good. This movie is full of action. If you have yet to see this movie go and see it. See this movie is all that i have to say. It is fun and action packed. We get to see Indy as a kid and also find out how he got his hat. We watch Indy and his dad go on a quest to find the Cup of Christ. The movie is very well done and if you liked the other two you will like this one. If you haven't seen this movie see it. This movie is one of my favorite action movies. It is just plain good. there is not much else to say about it other than that. Go for it. I strongly recommend this film. Sean Connary is great as Dr Jones. Good movie. nine out of ten.,9,6,12,16 December 2004
The Godfather," a gem of film history
","this is one of the greatest films ever made. Hands down. If you like movies and have yet to see this film. See it you will not be disappointed. The film has a little something for everyone in it. It follows the book The Godfather by Mario Puzzo. Basically, it is about Don Vito Corelone retiring as head of the family business and handing it to his son Michael. This movie is definitely at the top of my list. It is my favorite of the trilogy with Part 3 in a close second. Every part of this film is perfect. From the acting to the technical aspect. The AFI ranked this movie somewhere in the top five or ten films ever made. In my opinion it should be number one.Fabulous film 10/10 stars.",10,0,2,7 December 2004
