The Incredible Hulk," Monstrously good time!
","A reeboot of the Hulk franchise, this time connected to the MCU, The Incredible Hulk is not a perfect film but delivers perfectly at what the film is attempting to do. Make no mistake, this is a hardcore action movie. The highlights of this film are when the beast is unleashed. The Hulk is a complete badass (for lack of a better word). This movie is filled with suspense and tension as Bruce Banner, played sombrely by Edward Norton, is on the run. This is a character lead film and Edward Norton does a great job making a sympathetic lead. This whole movie is practically a love letter to the Incredible Hulk show from the '70s. All in all, a very entertaining movie with a surprise cameo from Iron man himself!",10,0,0,20 May 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," WOW
","This movie will leave you floored. Marvel means business now. This movie brings together all of your favourite superheroes and weaves them into a desperate and complex narrative which surprisingly doesn't feel strained. The Russo brothers have done it again, they made a film that brings together all of these icons yet still tells a complete, well-defined story. This film has great humour but is mainly a darker film. The situation is tense and there is a strong feeling of hopelessness. Thanos is a very strong, compelling, almost sympathetic yet ruthless villlain unlike any the Avengers have faced before. Bring your tissues people because this movie pulls no punches. The film takes all sorts of risks and there are moments that are truly heartbreaking. YOU NEED TO EXPERIENCE THIS AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE! Fantastic movie that surprised me after 18 Marvel movies of the same.",10,1,4,20 May 2018
Iron Man," Bold and fresh Superhero epic
","This first instalment in the Iron man franchise, starring the now irreplaceable Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, is a very refreshing and bold film. The film subverts typical 'superhero movie' film tropes and opts to go down a more risky path. A movie filled with great action, memorable lines, solid humour, and a heart, Iron man is one of the best superhero movies of the decade.",10,0,0,20 May 2018
