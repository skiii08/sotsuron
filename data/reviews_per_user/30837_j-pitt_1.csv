","Born and raised in Chicago,the train scenes were a source of constant distraction. That is to say, I was predisposed to confirm or deny the accuracy of anything pertaining to the train scenes. For example, The trains appeared to be Metra units; however, they carried a different logo. The train interiors did not have Metra upholstery. They is no Glenbrook station. Glenbrook is an area between Glenview IL and Northbrook, IL. The area includes Glenbrook High School and Glenbrook Hospital. There is a Glenview station. The Glenbrook station in the film appears to be the Arlington Heights station. In which direction were the trains traveling? The Metra trains run out of Chicago like spokes on a bicycle wheel. They travel north, south, east and west. Otherwise, I throughly enjoyed this film at the historic ( 1927 ) Pickwick Theatre in Park Ridge, IL. The story line was riveting, and was well told. The entire cast gave very believable performances. All the scenes moved the story along. There were no wasted moments of film or dialogue.",9,0,1,18 April 2011
