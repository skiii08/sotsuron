The Avengers," Entertaining Night Out
","Just got back from seeing the Avengers and have to say that I enjoyed it. It had a non- stop feel and some of the best action sequences I've seen. Is it a great action movie? Absolutely! Is it one of the best superhero movies ever? I'm not an expert in the genre, but I bet it is. Was it one of the top 50 overall movies of all time? No way!I was really shocked when I saw an IMDb rating of almost 9 for this movie and I'm hoping that over time, cooler heads will prevail and bring the movie's rating down into the 7's where it likely belongs.I found that the writing was fine for an action movie but I certainly didn't lose myself in the reality of it all. There were a number of sequences where the dialogue and interactions of the characters was not believable or compelling.I apologize to those who would quip that dramatic dialogue and characters with whom the audience can empathize don't belong in this type of film but I think they do and I'm sure we'll see it someday.Go see this movie - well worth the trip to the theater to see it on the big screen. Savor the amazing special effects and action scenes that are so well put together. Please don't suggest that the film ranks with some of the all time great works of art that have made it to film.",Null,4,9,28 May 2012
