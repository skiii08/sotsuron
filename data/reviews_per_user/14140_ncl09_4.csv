Deepwater Horizon," Watching Paint dry....
","Way too short, it felt like the film was rushed. The action sequences felt forged in a sense that CGI was perhaps used? Not a good combination to have Kurt Russell and Mark Walberg in the same film - lets stick to the Fast and Furious franchise, where your better suited. Mr Walberg.. Ted 3 perhaps?",1,4,8,30 June 2017
The Prestige," Intriguing from start to finish
","The film opens up with a monologue by Michael Cain, surprisingly explaining how a magic trick or illusion is performed. Within minutes we are introduced to all the main character, which with nowadays movies, is rare. As the film unfolds the film seems to break and pull back the fourth wall, allowing the audience a 'behind the scene's' if you will into the performance, forgetting that it's a film we are watching and not the performance. The acting and dialogue from all characters is second to none. The film leaves you deeply thinking with each scene , however the plot and ending (if you catch on early enough) are revealed during the opening to middle parts. A very well written, performed and spoken film from Christopher Nolan.",9,0,1,27 March 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," Simply Stunning
","From start to finish Guardian's of the Galaxy bringd the audience into the film. If you've never read the comics- fear not. Not only are we introduced to the main character within seconds of the films, but we are also given a lime light into why hes called Star Lord. Chris Pratt brings, heartbreak, comedy, seriousness and romance into one giant bundle of science fiction galore. Vin deisal as the Groot and Bradley Cooper as Rocket brings warmth and comedy to the film. The dialogue is second to none and as from a viewing perspective, thinks both men brought something a little personal to the role as well, bringing their own personalities into the dialogue. I would highly recommend this as been one of the greats marvel has produced. Overall rating 10/10",Null,1,4,26 November 2014
Sully," Outstanding performance, gripping from start to finish
","Tom Hanks portrays 'sully' to the letter, the dialogue from start to finish, with the acting combined resulting in a masterpiece been brought to big screen. With Biopics as a whole been very difficult to show on the big screen, this film not only tells the story from sully's POV, but we also see a slight PoV from his wife. In certain aspects through, you are drawn into the film that much that you feel that you are watching a documentary rather then a factious/based on a true story film. The action within the film is limited in a sense that the whole film centres around the aftermath of the events in question, rather then building up to what actually happens, which is a fantastic way of displaying it to an audience. Arron eckleharts performance is also true to heart, The dialogue on both characters truly shows that they can both truly adapt to whom ever they play. truly a brilliant film.",9,0,0,30 June 2017
