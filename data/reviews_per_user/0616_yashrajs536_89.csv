The Avengers," No doubt one of the best superhero movies ever.
",When I watched 'Marvel's The Avengers' I had became a fan of it I was surprised to see all the heroes together at a big screen when I watched the trailer I was blown up by it.I had too much expectations from it and I have to say that this movie had full filled my expectations this movie had made me a Fan of superhero genre.Before The Avengers I was not a fan of sci-fi superhero genre but when I watched the concepts of this movie I had really liked it.And after The Avengers I had watched all the superhero movies of marvel and DC comics really liked this movie wish to watch a sequel if it comes out I will definitely watch it.,10,2,6,18 December 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirates are back with a bang!!!
",I just watched pirates 4 on my TV and it was so good that I am comparing it to the first one!! The direction is now handled by Rob Marshall and he is also good at it the one thing I like the most visual effects were awesome in all the parts and in this one to.'Johnny Depp' what to say about him???!!! He is awesome as a captain Jack Sparrow and the other supporting cast were also awesome.The concept is change as always and I liked it the comedy well acting by Depp has made this movie superb!!I love this franchise and overall it was a good movie and a worth watch Hail Disney!!!,8,0,1,18 July 2015
Men in Black 3," Good fun...
",Just watched 'MIB 3' on my phone i wanted to watch this movie since it has debuted in 2012... but I didn't downloaded it and now after 3 years I did it and finally watched it.... it was a good movie with amazing graphics and nice aliens.....Will Smith is really the heart of this film as he acted so good I laughed many times throughout the movie.Other cast members were also good and they had also acted very well it was a good popcorn flick and also I liked it I watched the first installment (film) of this franchise half only so i like this franchise. ...Overall it was a good flick and I hope they have a sequel in the future which should be entertaining like this.,7,0,1,31 August 2015
The Incredible Hulk," Oops! Hulk Smashed my mind
",I was really disappointed by the first one there was poor direction action and also a poor star cast in it.But by this one I was really happy by all of it all the things were good and the final fight was awesome the villain was also good all the concepts and the scenes weren't boring me but it was entertaining me really.The effects were also good in this one I am really hoping that if the sequel comes I will definitely go to it.Please I will request make the sequel or reboot of it I really like the Hulk.I will definitely watch the future hulk films only and only in theaters,9,3,4,18 December 2014
Mission: Impossible III," Solid movie
",This is my first review for MI series.Watched MI3 its good there are the films which can be easily forgettable but not this one the film has got a good action sequences and also now I am feeling that JJ Abrams is a very good director.I mean look at this movie he is successful in making the thriller in whole movie and also the things which I want to talk about are GADGETS.These gadgets shown in the movie are pretty cool and match with every sequence I also liked the acting of all the actors and also the action gadgets for those I talked above all of this made me to like this movie. Worth a watch.,7,1,1,8 February 2015
The Equalizer," A one time watch!!!
",I had recently watched the equalizer and I liked its story acting and I also liked a action bar sequence by watching that sequence I had felt that the movie has got incredible action but as the movie was going I had felt that it has been more concentrated on a story line rather than showing some action and as the story was normal they had stretched the movie too much which I had not liked.The movie had felt me like I watched it 100 times helping others and all I am too much disappointed by this movie but as I liked it for its quite action sequences especially bar sequence and also for its bomb blasting sequences but the movie was not great not only in story but also in action in comparison John Wick was awesome than this it had also got a simple story but it's action sequences led me to like that movie.But in case of equalizer there is nothing I can like except some scenes not the whole movie I am saying don't waste your money on this.'A ONE TIME WATCH' believe me,6,5,8,2 February 2015
The Expendables 2," The best in the series
",The Expendables 2 (2012) is no doubt the best film in expendables series I was somewhat disappointed by the first one but this one has filled its gap. It has succeeded in giving the entertainment we want in an expendable movie.The acting was great my favorite 'Sylvester Stallone' was great In his role and the other actors 'Arnie' 'Bruce Willis' were also great remaining actors were also good at their place.The direction by 'Simon West' is superb and the action in the film was great.'Jean Claude Van Damme' was a great choice for a Villain in this film after all he is 'Kick boxer'.Overall the movie was good and great from its prequel and sequel (The expendables 3).,9,0,0,11 July 2015
Skyfall," Daneil craig is james bond!
",I watched Skyfall and I felt that like the other bond movies it lacked action I mean the action sequences were not enough to entertain the viewer the action scenes were very low and the more and more concentration is given to the bond style suits and all.I think that the film was not up to the mark as it was reported around 200 million budget you can take the other movies which are as of same budget but they lacks action sequences.I cannot understand how a big budget Hollywood movie can lack action sequences? I think they like to spend on promotion rather than on film.But despite of all this I like this movie I am a fan of Daniel Craig and I liked his casino royale very much but the Daniel Craig has somewhat balanced this movie he was stylish doing action very well and all.I liked this movie but hope that if any new bond movie comes it must have more action sequences.,7,2,4,18 March 2015
The Hangover," Hangover,a good movie
",I had just watched the hangover today I had heard that the film is awesome and when I saw it I was totally shocked by seeing its comic sequences and also all the actors have done their job over beautifully.Plus the director Mr.Phillips has also done well.The three of the characters were good at there places and also I will appreciate its story and concept of road trip.And also the supporting actors were good.I am happy by seeing this movie and I also hope if its gets a sequel it would be much better because now I had a great expectations from this movie and I will be happy if it get the franchise.Kudos to all the film team and wish they will work same in the future like they did in this film.,9,1,2,11 December 2014
Iron Man 3," Becoming iron man fan
",OMG!! How the marvel studios has managed to make their greatest star to a great movie I have to say this that there should be appreciation for marvel studios or such a great film.Basically I am both DC and marvel comics fan but I hope that the character ill be taken into another level in future films.In this film I like the action scenes as well as the graphics story and whatever and I have to say that they had made such a beautifully film and they had also make great use of their budget.Robert Downey Jr. His efforts has taken this franchise to an another level and I have to say that he is the real iron man he totally suits for this role he is born for this role.,10,13,20,11 December 2014
John Wick," 'People keep asking if he is back yeah he is back!!!'
",when I watched john wick trailer I thought the movie will be awesome as I was blown by it so I wanted the movie to be good and when I watched it I was blown by the movie too!!! The acting and action done by reaves was just quite awesome he looks working hard for this movie and he really did it despite he is fifty years old he has done superb action he looked a real bad ass assassin and he has set a new benchmark in action by doing gun-fu.....And the other supporting cast were also good at their places and this film also tells us one thing never mess with a dog otherwise you will be killed and all.....overall the film was awesome and a must watch for action lovers and also those who love brutal action like me.... the film is a good treat for us.I heard about its sequel is in works definitely going to that one.....,9,1,4,25 July 2015
Kung Fu Panda," Good fun!!!
",I watched 'Kung fu panda' last night on my phone and it was very good than I thought I am not relating to the graphics and all but the concept and story are the things I liked the most.....It has a good comedy and delivered a good excitement to me which I wanted in it the fight scenes were designed beautifully and was totally fit to a 'Panda'......The film has also showed us about some Chinese flavour in it and it was a pretty good edition to this film. And the rest of the team was good and the villain the tiger I don't remember his name he was totally a superb villain.....And his fighting scenes were also well made alomg with the Chinese tradition and some good quotes... Overall a good film. ...,8,0,0,1 September 2015
Star Trek," Despite some confusions i still liked this movie
",First of all the techs gadgets concept acting directing and action are the things which I liker in this movie but what a concept they were leading to I can't understood properly.How did the future Spock came into the past and all. But still the movie was popcorn and fun more concentration is given to concept not action which is not good but I liked it.I never heard about star trek that's why may be I not understood the concept but its OK it was still a paid off movie and enjoyable.I liked 'into darkness' its sequel it was also filled with new concepts and all when thing I can't understood is the story they were trying to show but that's OK I will watch it like a popcorn movie.,7,0,0,19 March 2015
Zootopia," 'What a Film!!!!'
","When I watched Zootopia's Trailer I was not convinced I don't know but It looked so boring to me. But when I saw the whole movie I was literally shocked....It was damn amazing and it turned out to be one of the best animated movies ever. As in the terms of Story it was good in concept it was also good, Screenplay damn good.I loved all of the character Judy Hobbs, Nick Wilde, Duke Weaselton and 'Mr. BIG' all of them were awesome.It has something which connects all type of audiences with it. Overall an awesome adventure can't wait for Sequel.",9,5,9,6 July 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Falls short at some points but still a good sequel.
",I just watched pirates 2 last night it was good though it fall short at some points but still it was good and a fun movie like the first.The acting directing was again great by all the film's actors and director the visual effects were again great and it was totally a new adventure from the first and I liked it!!!'Johnny Depp' again proved him to be a perfect choice for 'Jack Sparrow' his acting has never felt short or bored he was always energetic throughout the movie.Other supporting actors were also good and the visual effects shows the hard work of the team.Overall the film was good and fun to watch mainly because of johnny depp and done other actors and I will thank the 'Disney' for making such a great adventure movie.,7,0,1,17 July 2015
Rocky V," Good movie
",So the fifth chapter in the rocky saga is good as its prequels but one thing they changed 'Ring fight converted into Street fight' when I saw this I was shocked.The film also focuses on the father son family relationships and all it was good. One thing I must say is that the first 'Rocky (1986)' movie is the Sylvester's Greatest movie of his carrer and made me a Stallone Fan.The other chapters are also good but no one can defeat the original !!!! . Even if its directed by the first ones director.As a Sylvester's fan I liked this movie and hope that one day original rocky will be defeated by another rocky movie!!!,7,2,2,5 July 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Simply Johnny Depp's Best Movie!!!!
",I had watched pirates 1 on my phone two days ago and it just felt awesome the visual effects are outstanding . The story was bit different and the concept was totally different.The acting was great and the comedy done by all actors was good and entertaining to watch. The direction was very good.'Johnny Depp' is perfect for a arole of 'Captain Jack Sparrow' and the comedy done by him was outstanding.Other supporting cast were also good at their places. The movie was very much fast pace and I like that.Overall the movie was awesome and worth watchable and bit Unforgettable.,8,0,2,17 July 2015
Star Trek Into Darkness," Not watched the first one but still liked it
",I had not watched the first star trek but I still have to say that I liked this movie and I also have to say that I still liked its graphics and also fight scenes of this movie.Director j.j Abrams has also done an awesome work in this movie I have to say that I had also liked the whole concept story line and all of it.Still waiting for a next sequel and I will also watch its prequel this movie had made me a fan of it and also made me a fan of director j.j Abram's . I will definitely watch its sequel if it comes in theaters and I must watch its first installment if it runs on television.Seriously much awaiting for a sequel.,8,2,5,16 December 2014
Aquaman," Looks like DC is on the right track to get its mojo back !!
",I am a hard core Batman fan so I can call myself a DC fan also. Well after the DCEU started I was excited that it can give a neck to neck competition to Marvel but that never happened.Marvel always got good critical reviews as well as phenomenal box office numbers. And yes apart from Man of Steel the other consecutive movies BvS or JL they both were not upto the mark. Wonder woman was a good movie though.Because of these dissappointments I was not excited for Aquaman. I thought this will also be added to the list of the above movies I mentioned. But I was proven wrong !! How did I forgot that the director of this movie is none other than Mr. JAMES WAN who made The conjuring and Furious 7. But everything aside. James wan yet again proved his mettle. And this movie is a sure shot blockbuster.DC has a bad repo for not giving much freedom to its directors. And that's why its movies become dissapointments. But as Wan claimed that he was given full freedom in making Aquaman we can ourselves see the results of it. And I hope that DC continues this trend in its future movies also.Back to the movie let's talk about pros and cons:-Pros :-1. Wan's direction is fantastic.2. Action director who has designed the action deserves a praise.3. VFX team also deserves a praise. A film like this is quite a difficult task to do. But still these guys have done it.4. Adding emotions in a proper proportion adds a character development aspect which we missed in previous DCEU movies. Though they could have shown more emotional attachment of Queen of Atlanta and Ocean Master.5. Performances by all the actors are fantastic.6. Art director also deserves a praise.Cons:-1. Film gets boring in between especially in Italy scenes.2. If character development of Black manta and Ocean Master could have been done a bit well. Then it could have been more amazing.My rating is 8/10.,8,3,5,26 December 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A Good sequel!!!
",I had just watched pirates 3om my phone and it was good not bad despite it has some letdown from the first two but its OK.The acting and visual effects are the main part of this franchise plus the changing of concept from its previous one is also a good thing.'Johnny Depp' is superb as always as Jack Sparrow but this time his entrance was somewhat boring not a better as the last two.But he managed to balance the scenes if himself as his acting us strong!!!This film has taken the story of the last one and continued it so it is a pure sequel.Overall the film was good but forgettable.,7,0,1,17 July 2015
Deadpool 2," A bit of a slow pace, but still a good film to watch.
",When I was the first Deadpool I was not satisfied with that when the trailer had arrived I was very excited to watch that movie but the action was not satisfying but still I like that one. Now as for the second installment I was not excited that much but after watching that movie I like this one as compared to the last one as for acting Ryan Reynolds is a deadpool and the other supporting password acting as well. But what I like the move was the humour in this movie as we have seen Deadpool as an anti Hero character so like the first one we were expecting humour to be good and we have to agree that humour is important to this movie and they have nailed it the humour was really good.Though I liked this one but I will suggest that it's a one time movie. So do watch it if you are a fan of Deadpool all X Men franchise or Marvel fan do watch it.,7,0,3,7 August 2018
The Terminator," Good but more as a average film not great
",The Terminator was a good movie but it was not great it was more of a average film though the direction done by Cameroon was good but it was somewhat boring at some places.The acting was good and the tech shown in the movie was good Arnie was good as a Villain but not great the supporting actors were just OK.The concept is good but I think that the sequel wants more work to outdo this one I liked it but I think it has to come with more weapons more techs after all it's a Robotic movie man.They had tried hard to make this good and I appreciate them at some places but I really don't like the chemistry between Kyle and Sarah the bonding between future and past come on!! It showed the son has sent his father gimme a break man.Show more Robotics and action and concentrate on your concept.It was forgettable but OK quite a entertainment only because of Arnie.Arnie rocks !!!,7,1,8,8 July 2015
Fast & Furious 6," 6th film in F&F series is not great as its prequel but an above average film.
",'I watched 'Fast & Furious 6' in theatres and I will tell you that I started to watch this series after my brothers showed me 'Fast Five' in theatres that film was easily became my one of the favorite action movies till date'.And when I watched the trailer for Fast 6 'I was blown by it' the action was much strong than the Fast Five so I decided to watch this but I sadly say I was not impressed fully by it as compared to fast five.The action was insane but still it was not good in terms of emotions and feelings as they were good in Fast Five.Dwayne Johnson my favorite hero was awesome in this movie as 'Luke Hobbs' and other actors were good but this movie is forgettable not good as Fast Five but remains as a above average due to its action.,7,1,2,6 July 2015
Suicide Squad," Hoped Worst Turned Out Good.... 'my rating 7.2/10.'
",Well Suicide Squad one of the much hyped movies this year has finally arrived. I went to theater with least expectations as I was not hyped by its trailers but wanted to see because it was a part of DCCU. Seriously BvS trailer was much better than SS's trailers.BvS 3 hr ultimate edition was good than theatrical version anyway I will talk about SS. Critics have this movie a big THUMBS DOWNðŸ‘Ž as they did to BvS but it was good.Unlike BvS WB injected some comedy in this movie and that's what pretty interesting plus the acting of Margot Robbie and Will Smith added a blast in this one. Rest of the cast was good. Ben Affleck's dark knight special appearance was very good as I liked him in BvS.Visuals and Graphics and Fight Scenes were good. Story was not as gripping as it would have been but that's OK it's usual with Superhero Movies. At least BvS (3 hr version) and this one doesn't let me down and i can look forward to WW and JL. I don't know why WB's movies are being compared with Marvel's as both's tones are different. I mean you know WB has its own flavor. But WB has still have to work hard in comparison to Marvel but that's OK it will do.Overall the movie was good and i am recommending you pls don't go with high expectations. It is strictly my personal opinion other depends upon you guys.My rating 7.2/10 (enjoyable yet forgettable).,7,1,4,7 August 2016
Shutter Island," Shutter Island!!!
",I watched 'Shutter Island' today and it was awesome I never expected much from it but it turned out to be one of my best movies till date...The film was going straight initially and slowly it moved to the confusing events which raised my excitement to the high level and when finally the suspense was revealed i was just feeling that I watched 'Masterpiece'!!!I like Di-Caprio after 'Titanic (1993)' and 'Inception (2010)' and his 'The Great Gatsby' was also good but the above films were much good than that and after them I am adding 'Shutter Island' as the third Di- Caprio's awesome film.....He was good and I much heard about Martin Scorsese as a great director and now after watching this I say he is real good.I liked the film's maintaining of thriller throughout his whole duration and the adding of clues and confusion till the Conclusion was a smart move and after the Conclusion the film was at its best....Overall a Superb psychological thriller !!!,10,1,4,29 August 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," An excellent move by marvel
",This movie captain America is a no doubt one of the huge blockbusters of this year and it promises to become it really.when we watches the trailer of any movie at any time we always being confused that it will be good? Will it surpass our expectations? Will it contain a good story? EtcBut this movie I have to say that it was awesome though it doesn't managed to get a good 3D effects but it was good in all of the other things and a biggest reason to watch this is that it is connected to the avengers and it will also take the franchise to another level.I am both DC and MARVEL comics fan in DC I like batman whereas in MARVEL i like Thor.But this superhero also managed to take a good place in my heart.I had to tell that the studio is making a bold move to handle the franchise the guardians of the galaxy was Also very good And I am proud that we are getting these movies and in future hope so...,10,0,2,10 December 2014
Interstellar," A good movie but not to the Nolan's level
",I first of all start by saying that I am a Nolan fan because of his excellent work on his films I mean the man who took the Batman movies to an another level I like his work on The dark knight trilogy and inception.When I watched interstellar I hadn't felt that excitement I always feel in Nolan's films in this film many technical words are used and the story is also a bit different from its trailer.The story looked a bit confusing and also it looked it has lacked at some points the acting was good but I felt that the development of the characters are not properly done.And I was also confused when the film came into its climax I never understood this movie I suggest the people who have knowledge of astronomy and about space can go and watch this film it is not suitable for normal people.But I liked Nolan's work.His direction superb as always I am no saying that I am totally disappointed but due to the confusion I felt while watching this movie I felt a bit bored but how much part i understood it was good I am saying the movie is good not excellent as per the Nolan's level.I will give it an 7/10 wish I could give 10/10 if I had understood the movie.,7,1,4,2 February 2015
Rocky II," Good sequel to a great film.
",The 2nd chapter follows the first very much but it is good at its place too!!!it is directed by Stallone and the acting was good the boxing was also good and well presented.It somewhat falls short from the Original but its good.As a Stallone Fan I liked it Rocky Finally beats Apollo Creed in this one and it made me proud.I cheered at the film's end Rocky Balboa!!! When i watched the first one I became a fan of this franchise and even the sequel were not good as the original they were good at their places.Rocky is a successful franchise and I hope that a Spin off film 'Creed (2015)' will also be upto the mark as the franchise deserves.Good luck to this franchise!!!!! Hail Rocky!!!,8,2,2,5 July 2015
Ant-Man," Good but not great!!!
","I watched 'Ant man' last night on my phone. when it was announced I was so excited and when the first trailer debuted it felt short on my expectations but 2nd trailer was so good that I decided to look forward to it.But Movie was good though it was not great as I expected but it somewhat was good. The acting was good, The action was as it should be in an 'Ant man' movie but I think they still need to develop the action.Story was OK the heist concept was a good addition.The Sci Fi concept was good it lacks action and was a very fast paced movie it was just 102 minutes and gone very fast. It is not upto that 'Marvel Movie Excitement' but it was good at its place.If you will watch this without thinking as a Marvel movie it will feel you good.Overall a good but not great movie.",7,0,8,1 August 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good movie!!!
",'Captain America :- The first avenger is a Good movie.' The movie has a unique concept and continues Marvel Legacy the film has got a good concept story and all.The acting directing was good Chris Evans was good in Fantastic Four but more good as the Captain America the film has shown sci-fi concepts military and all.Some concepts were unbelievable and somewhat illogical so this is not great but good movie but film was entertaining.It was a fun movie and Comedy was also good for example the shows conducting for Captain America for people and all there is also one interesting thing 'Howard Stark' father of iron man it was overall entertaining nteresting movie.,7,1,2,6 July 2015
The Godfather: Part II," Falls short from 1st one but at its place a Good movie!!!
",I had watched 'The Godfather 2' last night and i found it good but it was a fall short from the 1st one. The original has its own speciality that i didn't found in this one. The reason that the movie was not good as the 1st one was its 'excessive length'.It has a long 200 minutes long run that i think should be reduced the film was quite started boring after 3 hours its excessive length makes it a bit Uncomfortable.But it still a quite drama MASTERPIECE as the acting was good I missed vito corleone but its younger version was also good.And the story was simple and good to watch the direction by ' Francis D Coppola ' was good. Overall a one time watch movie not proceeding the first one but good at its place and forgettable.,8,0,2,24 July 2015
The Bourne Ultimatum," ''Simply The Best in the series....'
",Finally our great Bourne Franchise has come to an conclusion and it was no doubt fantastic.Thanks Director Grass for making such a good movie.... it was a superb treat for us fans.The Bourne Ultimatum exceeds it's predecessors in almost every way. It has more human emotions and feelings it has more good action than the previous two. More story More Suspense and final conclusion. I think it had shown a much better picture of how franchise will go ahead.It's not over as 'Jason Bourne I.e. Bourne 5 is coming in 2016 with Damon and Paul Greengrass returning as Actor and Director' i am super excited for this one. ULTIMATUM > IDENTITY > SUPREMACY The Bourne Legacy is on different course so it is not be included. Otherwise it's a good series and good luck to this franchise.,9,2,3,16 June 2016
Oblivion," Pretty brilliant!!!!! in entertainment...
","I watched 'Oblivion' a few days ago and I liked it they have exceeded in terms of entertainment and they have also come up with a new excited concept and story first I was thinking that it is pretty same to 'Elysium' so I was disliking it but as the film went I became interested and much more interested in it.....Tom cruise was brilliant at his place as he delivered a above average entertainment in it i like his MI series and E.O.T very much snd his jack reacher was also good but this one also made its place in my favourite cruise movie's list....Acting, directing, concept all was good and overall a good movie to watch....",8,1,2,13 September 2015
Justice League," Ignore the critics !! Just go and watch it !!
","I grew up watching the Justice League's animated series. And it was one of my favorite one's. When Marvel came with it's superhero movies i hoped that WB should also start franchise. Well 'better late than never' this franchise is quite good. It's like a dream come true for a JL fan like me. I literally enjoyed it. First I was in a conundrum after reading the reviews. But I decided to watch and it paid off. Snyder really did a good job adding comedy and also making this film short not a pathetic 2.30 hours like 'BvS'. And this film was better than his previous two's. But I don't know why critics target his movie's ?? Whereas on the other hand each and every Marvel movie is getting rave reviews??Acting of the cast :-The acting of the cast was good; Ezra Miller as Barry Allen and Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry were really a great entertainers. I wasn't hoping that much good performance from Ezra as 'The Flash's' TV series star Grant Gustin is phenomenal in this role. But Ezra really did justice to it. And I liked Aquaman's cool attitude in the movie !Ben Affleck as Batman was good as he was in the last one BvS. Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot and Ray Fisher did justice to there roles. Action sequences and tech's :-The best action scene in the whole movie was of Wonder Woman's in her entry when she saves the hostages ; she killed it !! along with the slow motions shots it became even more delightful to watch ; The Night Crawler tech of Batman was beautiful and Cyborg what to say?? 'A human computer' ; Flash's and Superman's scenes were good. Overall I as a FAN of JL series enjoyed this movie and I will suggest others to go watch it. Don't miss your childhood favorite franchise's cinematic film just for the critics !!",8,2,6,18 November 2017
Man of Steel," A great hero gets a great movie
",When I was watching the trailer for man of steel I felt that this movie will be the greatest movie for Superman and also it will take the sci-fi genre to the another level and finally when I saw the movie all of my expectations were full filled the movies action scenes were new though the origin was old but they had made a superman which is very difficult to make.I like this movie and waiting for its next sequel.In this movie Mr.Snyder has given one of the greatest directions in superhero genre. My results for this movie are positive and I hope the next installment will be greater than this one.So after watching this film my expectations are now higher from its sequel hope it will also exceed my expectations,7,13,22,10 December 2014
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The best Terminator movie till date!!!
",It has been many years after judgement day was released and still it has managed to remain as a best Terminator movie!!!The acting was very good and the direction did by Cameroon was Fantastic Arnie was Superb as a Terminator and the other supporting cast were also good.The action was Superb and T-1000 was just epic the acting made me felt as I am a Terminator and I have to save the world pretty awesome isn't it?!!The film has continued the story of first but has outdone the first movie in every way. And overall it was a great movie.,8,1,3,8 July 2015
We're the Millers," Strong Comedy!!!
","I watched 'we are the millers' last night and I must say it was awesome I had watched the hangover series so I decided to watch another Hollywood Comedy flick and I must say I was not disappointed.The movie was awesome and every actor in this movie deserves a kudos!!! Every one has done a great job in this movie.The actors have done a great job and the story was bit different so as Comedy which I liked the most and it has also showed some family feelings though they were not family but I liked it.Overall a fun movie, and a must watch.after hangover I will rate this movie and after this there comes 'Ted'. And this is also a bit Unforgettable movie.",8,0,1,25 July 2015
Rocky IV," Fourth Chapter of Rocky Saga is Good. But falls short in emotions again.
",So the fourth chapter in the Rocky saga is good as the franchise is meant to be!!!It again falls short in emotions and all but still good at its place the Stallone was good as the rocky always.The franchise is being directed by Stallone himself so there are many chances that the latest installment is good or or bad from another.But its going on its way so it is OK but i think the franchise is now wants a new director and has to be rebuilt like the original. Don't get me wrong Stallone can also do that he can also built this franchise strong as the first one.So in this chapter Apollo Creed dies and Ivan drago a Russian boxer played by Dolph Lundgren is better and he looks as a tough opponent to rocky the exercise of Rocky in this movie is bit hard as he did in the first one.Overall it somewhat short but still good and forgettable movie.,7,1,2,5 July 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Rogue Nation on par with Ghost Protocol.....
",After the original installment and Ghost Protocol this new installment Rogue Nation kept the Goodwill of the MI franchise and in my eyes also....Possible Spoiler ahead:-First when the movie started there is a scene I was waiting for......'plane stunt' and my blood just started to flow fast as my body started to make adrenalin in it... the scene I thought would be big but it was short scene and its good but not along to my expectations...so I gave 8/10 stars to this film.The film was letting itself down at some points but lifted up in Opera Scene so i was excited to watch it after interval. I was expecting at interval that it would not be Ghost protocol....But after interval the film just made me on edge of my seat as Tom cruise hold his breath for 3 minutes underwater and it was hilarious....And when the bike chase was going and started I wanted to give it a standing ovation because it was awesome.....Rebecca Ferguson was good at her place she was not 100% but 85% equivalent to Ethan hunt. And other cast were also good. Direction was good. Story was good with its twists and turns some MI classics scenes like masks and all...overall the film was good.Rogue Nation made its own place and not under Ghost protocol and I liked it....,8,0,2,9 August 2015
Dunkirk," Not a masterpiece but a good drama !!
",Well today I went to watch 'Dunkirk' only and only because I am a 'Nolan Fan'. He is one of the finest directors Hollywood could ever imagine for. After watching the trailer I was sure that it would be a drama centric rather than showing war. And it is my personal perspective that this movie is totally made to earn money. But not to show any scenarios of war to the audience. It's just centered on soldiers survival. Which it showed beautifully. Well it can also be understood that no body can make a movie on WW 2 as there were many events happened during that time. But I am thankful to Milan for showing us a taste of what happens when a war comes. How much difficulties soldiers face during the war. And it was horrifying according to me. Direction wise what can I say?? Just two words 'Maestro Nolan'. Acting wise the actors were good there was no heroism where one hero survives no matter how much he is wounded or anything. It showed the reality of the war not any unexpected miracles total reality Picturization was very good and well captured. But I recommend that it is watchable only in IMAX format. Otherwise it will not give any entertainment in a single screen to the viewers. So overall I can say that it is purely a commercial movie but it does give some sense and shows the consequences of war. Not a Nolan masterpiece but a good movie it achieved it's goal of showing survival of the soldiers.,7,1,7,13 August 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Disappointed,only half expectations fulfilled
",I am a big fan of x men franchise I had watched and liked all of the x men movies but what happened with this one? Not containing too much action only based upon story.When I had watched the trailer I was really blown up by the trailer and thus I had too much expectations but this flick had full filled my half expectations only.First of all the 3D effects were not so good and also lack of action sequences had disappointed me I had really tried to like this movie but because of these 2 reasons I was disappointed.But I have to say that the story line was brilliant and also the acting by all actors and direction by Mr.singer.But still I am an x men fan and I wish if it gets a sequel in future my expectations will be 3D effects and more and more action please.,10,0,1,18 December 2014

How to Train Your Dragon 2," Great sequel!!!!
",I had watched this MASTERPIECE last night in my phone and what can I say about it?!!! It was such as awesome as the first one was!!!The graphics and VFX are now too much strong as compared to the first one and the story emotions are also well added in this movie.The film has followed the story of the first one but has a little minus point a spoiler:- Hiccup's dad is dead and this is the one point I didn't liked in the movie otherwise it was good.Overall the film was entertaining and a must watch in the theatres as it has a very good visual and VFX and also a better in story emotions and all.,8,1,3,19 July 2015
The Transporter," Statham's Action skills makes this film Worth Watchable!
",I had to admit that Jason statham proved himself as a action star by way of this flick I liked him from this flick he had used his full martial arts techs to make this film watchable I am surprised by its action sequences.I Also agree that the film is boring at some points and it also includes very less action scenes but the duration of the film has overshadowed it so it is good.Plus there are some unbelievable action stunts but still I.am liking it I had not watched its sequels but I will sure watch them as I would like to see whether they are good from this.I am not disappointed by this movie I hope that the next sequels would be better than this.This flick had forced to me to become the fan of Jason statham really he is the action star I full admit it!!!,8,0,0,18 January 2015
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Solid from its predecessor
",Watched MI4 in theatre oh wow this movie has blown my mind seriously this movie was awesome than its predecessor and I am well sure it will lift up the MI series to a huge franchises this movie was awesome at many things I mean action and action sequence was cool but again I would like to talk what I love most in this franchise GADGETS.Again like its predecessor this movie's gadgets are awesome and wicked cool and also the action sequences were awesome I heard that this.movies director Brad bird has taken a first time chance for making a live action movie so I thought i t would not be cool.But like JJ Abrams he also proved that he is a good and worthy director for this big Franchise so I am now speculating that the next film must be cool than this the 3 and 4 th installments were awesome now I want more action and gadgets in the 5th installment I will praise the directors and a whole crew for entertaining us.MI 4 is the best film in MI series yet I hope the 5th one will exceed it.,8,3,4,8 February 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," Go and watch it without expectations you will love it.
","As an ardent mutual fan of both DC and Marvel i was badly waiting for this movie to come out. When it released i went in without any expectations and i liked this movie.Some aspects which i liked:-1. This movie has focused on its villian THANOS and has given a good hints to the fans about both his emotional and his malignant nature. And Josh Brolin has given a full justice to this role.2. Iron Man's new suit and Spiderman's new suit.3. Thor's new hammer and his entry in the middle of the war.4. This movie has deleniated on the infinity stones. Some aspects which i disliked:-1. The movie was very lenghty it could have been shortened.2. Action was not included much and also 3D effects were lame. 3. As i said above, the story was deliberately stretched.Overall it was a good movie.",7,1,6,2 May 2018
Django Unchained," 'Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece'
",I had watched 'Django Unchained' in my phone first I thought that the film has a very excessive length but when I started to watch it. What I found was a masterpiece!!! The film was awesome.I haven't seen Western movies this is my first film in Western movies but it was very much awesome.Tarantino is very good in this genre he balances all the film very smoothly whether it will be of two hours or three!!!!!The acting was great and the star cast was filled with big actors and they balanced their roles very beautifully.Overall the film was very good and made me a fan of Western Films.,8,0,2,9 July 2015
The Incredibles," The movie is incredible...
",I like this movie since I watched it.... the film is awesome and has showcased a superhero genre in animation I liked big hero 6 and I also like this one that one was from marvel and this one is a gift from Sony.The film features a family which are already superheroes but they has got a holiday from their work but one of them was still working and when the family found that the main member was working they started to their work and all.... I didn't remember much so I didn't wrote much...I liked 'Brad bird's' direction when I watched mission impossible ghost protocol his first live action movie that was also good and so this one the action comedy family feelings and all are featured very beautifully in this movie...The film was a good treat for superheroes fans it was a good entertainment delight. It has featured good graphics and also good story and concept by watching this I must say that the superheroes should be made in animation too.I heard about its sequel in the works with bird directing again definitely going to this one...,9,0,0,26 July 2015
X-Men: Apocalypse," Not Spectacular as First Class or DOFP ; but still good though.....
",I had watched this film yesterday night and I think that it doesn't go head to head with its predecessors... Mathew Vaughan's and Bryan Singer's last movie 'First Class and DOFP' are still my favorites. But that doesn't mean I didn't like this one though Bryan Singer this time somewhat failed to deliver that entertainment and Chills which he gave us in his last one.Positive points :---1. Quicksilver again stole the show in this one they topped that slow motion DOFP's kitchen scene with there Slow motion School Scene in this one. And this Is what I much liked in this one. MY FAVORITE SCENE OF THIS MOVIE.2. Wolverine's Cameo though it was very good but i didn't think it was needed. But it can may be set up Wolverine 3.3. They showed some mutants past and origins which I much liked.4. Apocalypse was good.Negative:--1. Character Development was lacking.2. Movie's length was bit excessive.3. No proper screen time to all characters. In CA:CW one thing which i liked was that all characters got a shining scene of them everybody was looking awesome because of it. But this movie like BvS lacked that.,8,6,13,21 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," unnecessarily long and a total waste of a good character
","Back in may,I had a chance to see the movie and I was too much excited about this movie when I had watched the trailer and promos for this movie I was sure I will watch this in theater but what I found is the total waste of my money there was no a great story line as compared to the character and an unnecessarily romantic scenes which were not being matched to the movie. Though the electro was very good the only person and character I liked in movie and what about the direction of spider? What is happened to this one the films which were made by Sam ramie were the great movies of spider but the reboot of the franchise doesn't means that it will be more good as compared to the first one.Terribly, I have to say that this franchise has a lot to do specially on story line The things which I had liked in the movie were Electro, Action scenesAnd also the other two villains also doesn't makes sense in the movie the one was enough I think the franchise is at its best in its CGI and VFX but it needs to be work on story line as well as the direction in the movie",6,3,9,10 December 2014
Big Hero 6," So marvel is superb in animation too!!!

Black Hawk Down," Superb war movie!!!
","First I am a fan of Ridley's direction I loved his Body of lies film very much and last night I watched 'Black hawk down' on my phone it was huge entertaining film and it was also emotional.This film has managed to make a serious military tone till its end the scenes of war were amazing and some scenes like a broken hand, a half body of a soldier was very hard to watch.The film has shown the real face/ scenario of war and I liked the most in it. Plus the acting also makes it a great film.Scott's direction was awesome the film is very well made and the most of it scenes were of war which it was expected to show us it never concentrates in Comedy and silly things it is totally concentrated on war.Overall the film was a must watch.",8,3,4,9 July 2015
Logan," A satisfying standoff to X men's most popular character....
",Logan is really a different X men movie in the whole franchise while the other X men movies looked commercial this one looked more dramatic and emotional.It really satisfied me as a viewer that I am watching a true send off to a immensely popular character of this franchise. It paid off really well. Action wise it was perfect totally looked like 'Wolverine Action'. Emotion and Acting wise Superb. All of the characters from Hugh Jackman to the supporting cast all of them were pretty good. Director James Mangold has really got the emotional pulse of the people and he portrayed wolverine's character just like that. It wasn't a commercial movie but was more Character Driven with satisfying action and a good climax and all.This was totally a different experience from the previous Installments. I will recommend you to watch this one !!!My ratings 8/10.,8,1,4,3 March 2017

I watched his 'The-A team' which was also a awesome movie but I never thought that he will be awesome in his alone presence too....The director has done a pretty good work with this film and Luc besson has written a pretty good script and the acting was also enjoyable....Overall a good action movie and pretty interesting. ...,10,0,0,12 September 2015

",'Avatar' is a title gained from 'Sanskrit' language of India and the story technology concept shown in this movie are from Hollywood So it is a mixture of 'Hindi title+English Concept'.The movie when I watched it on my DVD I felt a great excitement when I was watching it the direction was very good after all it's a ' James Cameroon' movie man!!!!The acting was very good and the concept was just looked a bit epic the technology war machines and the vehicles were just awesome.Though I felt a little bored while there was a chemistry between two pandorians 'Jack and Neytiri' but overall it was good and never seen concept movie.And it was also a bit Unforgettable.Hail Hollywood!!!,9,3,5,8 July 2015
Mission: Impossible," Good but Confusing.
",Mission Impossible (1996) is a first film in MI series. I watched it on last night and I was surprised movie was good.But I think to create a suspense in the film the makers have ruined the story a little bit. It is hard to know the suspense in the film.Though film was entertaining through its Gadgets planing and acting the film's Suspense is not well shown to people they have somewhat ruined it I think.But otherwise film was good the direction acting was good but the film's minus point is its way of opening the suspense which cannot be understand by some audiences I think so!!!,8,1,2,11 July 2015
National Treasure," I liked it!!
",I watched National treasure in my TV and I was shocked by its concept story and all the concept was very different and it is related to history which was my favorite subject!!!And acting and all was predictable and OK but the concept and all was interesting and good and the planning was just good I didn't know about the secrets of declaration of Independence as I am not 'American' but what I saw in this movie was just good at its place.Overall the movie was made go and the acting was OK 'Nicholas cage' was good and was a perfect match for Ben his alias name in the movie the planning as I mentioned above was great it is forgettable but a good watch I.e. Not a bad movie.,7,0,0,22 July 2015

",Rocky 3 the third chapter in the rocky saga the franchise which I love the most !!!In this one the acting directing was OK not to its prequel's level but still good after all Rocky is in the ring in climax man!!! Who didn't love that??The opponent was pretty tough for rocky to beat but he will beat because he is 'Rocky Balboa' It falls short from its prequels because it is not concentrated on feeling emotion attachments and all its just focused on boxing and thats why I give it 7/10.But its still good because of its boxing scenes and a last fight for over 12 bells!!!! OMG.Overall it's good but a forgettable movie.,7,0,0,5 July 2015

And also the installment has taken the franchise to a new but satisfying level. While watching that film I never felt that it was unsatisfied film it was a total worthy installment of a great film.Keanu reeves was good as 'Neo (The One)' and also other stars were good at their places. Villain J. Smith (machine) is back and Moe he is shown as very powerful which was awesome .The direction and action sequences are the heart of this film as the story falls somewhat short as compared to the first one.Overall a 95% worthy installment....,7,2,3,20 August 2015

Iron Man," Superb!!!
",Iron man (2008) is one of the best Marvel movie till date it has a rating of 7.9/10 on IMDb and it truly deserve it.The techs gadgets shown in the movie are beyond imagination it was just awesome and the acting of 'Robert Downey Jr' is the second best attraction after gadgets in this movie.The other supporting actors in the movie was also good at their places and the iron man suit was so sexy man it was awesome.Overall the film proves and starts a new generation for Superhero films and kicks off Marvel to a great position.The other movie cannot be made like this the hulk was not a good for Marvel but Iron man changes it fully!!!,9,3,4,6 July 2015
Creed II," Still carries the spirit of the first one !!
","I became a Sly fan after watching Rocky 1. Since then, i have watched all of the installments of this franchise. And i am glad that it's spin-off Creed is turning out good also.In each and every film of this franchise, we see a fighter who is confident of winning. Then he gets beaten up and then we see an inspiring journey of him. In the end, everything goes into his favour. This is the trend of this franchise but I and many fans love to see that again and again. Because we feel let down again and again in our life. And we need motivation again and again.Let's come to the performances.Sly like every time nails the role of Rocky Balboa. He is now an aged grandpa but still fighting in his life. The other actors have played there roles perfectly.But I liked the direction and screen play of this film very much. The scenes where Creed goes with his baby and cries and then hits a Punch bag. Then his father's image is printed on the glass is shown in the background. Then when Rocky says to him that it's your time. And then we see that how a man has now been retired and then the inscribed word Creed on Rocky's jacket. Shows how much he was connected with him and son and how much journey they have covered. I liked that very much.Finally, my rating 8/10.",8,0,1,16 July 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," 'From Now on I won't listen to critics'
","When I first saw the reactions this movie was receiving and I was totally stunned by it as they were 'negative'..... all critics were against this movie and I was totally blown by that.... as I was waiting (like others) for this movie..And for the record, I follow the critics..... but now I won't as today when I went to theatre and I saw this movie..... man it was good!!!!! It was totally a good movie I was like shocked the movie was pretty amazing.... Ben Affleck just killed off as Batman though he was good as Bruce Wayne too... And Gal I can say no matter how much time she got she killed it as WW....... Henry Cavill was simple but I saw some improvement in him as compared to MOS...... Other supporting cast was good..... Jessie was somewhat annoying at start but he later improved....Doomsday was good......Overall I liked this movie and I will say that please don't follow the comics n critics and all just go watch at as an audience vision see their work and then give your reviews.....",9,16,30,24 March 2016

I loved this movie!!!The acting was good 'Bruce Willis' was good and also the supporting actors were good the comedy was good and the action scenes were good also.It had also shown a father daughter relation and all hacking done in this movie was at a big stage.Overall a film was a mixture of 'Old school action+Modern hacking' and was pretty awesome.,9,2,5,6 July 2015
Lucy," Loved it! But it has lost its charm in ending
",So Scarlet johannason has starred in this amazing movie 'Lucy' the movies concept was very good and very beautifully made I liked Scarlet's performance in Marvel's The Avengers' and 'The Prestige' but she has succeeded to continue her great acting through this movie and director Luck besson has also done a great job.Even though I liked this movie I am not giving 10 stars because of its ending the film started with a bang but literally lost its grip of excitement as it has reached to the climax.I think the ending should be different over all I didn't liked ending but except this the movie was worth watch.,7,3,8,2 April 2015
RED," Surprisingly Good movie!!!!
",I watched Red on my phone last night I didn't expect too much but it turned out to be a good entertainment to me!!!!'Bruce Willis' surprised me in his role I never thought he would be great and the action no doubt was 100% old school. And the guys are also old but Superb!!!Other supporting cast were also good 'Helen Mirren' was just perfect for her role she acted very well and 'Morgan Freeman' was quite a scene stealer his acting was also great.The comedy was well added Overall this movie is a must watch and fantastic for everyone who likes old school action.,7,1,1,13 July 2015
The Matrix," Good movie!!!
",I watched 'The matrix (1999)' last night on my phone and it was a good movie with amazing concept and good visual effects I liked keanu Reeves (the main hero of this film) after his 'John Wick (2014)' film and thats why I downloaded this movie because of him.And I must say I was not disappointed by this one too. It was also good but with a bit confusing concept like it is showed as a computer programming film and then they shows up a prophet who made a prediction about 'the one' and all what is this a computer program or a magic movie???They must have shown the movie as a technology and program as it is mainly based on it what is the need of entering this prediction and all....But despite of this I liked this movie.,8,2,4,22 July 2015

From the first trailer I was speculating that the movie will be awesome and thats I found in this movie it was good as I expected!!!The story is very different and it was totally different from its original 'Mad Max film' I had watched that Mad Max also and I thought the reboot will be same but it was totally different but acceptable!!!The acting was great and the direction done by 'George Miller' is superb he has completely outdone himself.Overall the movie was a top notch entertainer and superb!!!.

Warcraft," Agreed... Warcraft is a good movie even for non WOW players
",I just saw Warcraft and i must say that it is suitable for all. No matter if you have played its game or not. It is suitable to you as well.I was looking forward to it when I saw the first trailer... it was amazing. I can say that Orcs were looking real and the movie will literally take you into its fantasy world it definitely strikes chord with audience. I can say that CGI work is commendable. And that was the main reason I liked it. It was not boring movie at all. The Orcs scenes were fantastic and the last battle sequence was a perfect fantasy battle. I heard that Director Duncan Jones was a warcraft fan and while watching the movie I was feeling that he has done true justice to game. Even If i had watched its game trailers only. Overall I can say whether you are fan or not go watch this movie don't miss it.,8,7,13,13 June 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Great work by 'Ford' and ' Spielberg'.
",Indiana Jones is one of my favorite movie franchises of all time though I watched only two films of it!!!I am a huge fan of Steven Spielberg he is so awesome in his work and the acting done by Harrison Ford makes the movie even better.This movie is focused on the glass of carpenter and all the suspense adventure shown in the movie is superb.Other supporting cast were good at their places the direction acting as I mentioned above is superb.Overall the movie is a must watch for all the audiences i liked it very much and I also liked its sequel 'kingdom of the crystal skull'.,9,2,3,11 July 2015
Furious 7," Its Good better than Fast 6.
",Watched Furious 7 it was good seriously I didn't liked fast 6 much.though it was a popcorn but not at all interesting but due to its action it was worth watchable but still forgettable. But in Furious 7 I saw a improvement specially in family feelings and all. I saw a improvement in action but it was very fast paced I mean I can't believe that how 2 hrs were gone I never thought and the one thing I agree is the absence of some characters who were died in previous installments but over all it was a forgettable and a popcorn movie.Warning Spoiler ahead:-Readers it can be a possible spoiler for those who didn't watch it yet the villain of this movie has been not been given a big role as we thought though he had made a obstacles for torreto and his crew but not as much as I expected.And the biggest Spoiler I am talking about is that the villain is not dead yet yes Jason Statham is alive he is not dead yet he is still ready to make difficulties for torreto and his crew and this makes us to think about their next ride I.e. Furious' 8'.Yes there is a huge possibility that a sequel is coming as our bad guy is not dead yet.But overall it was a good movie and all but yet forgettable.,8,2,5,2 April 2015
