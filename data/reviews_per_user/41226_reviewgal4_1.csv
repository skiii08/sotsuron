Hereditary," A Nightmare that Blurs the Line Between Realism and Fantasy
","Ok, so I think it's safe to say that I will never be watching this movie again. An hour after watching it, I was afraid to look at my reflection in the window. This film is spectacular. Towards the beginning I thought it would be a drama about mother's and their daughters, but boy was I wrong. This isn't one of those movies that will try and gain the 'horror' label by implementing gory effects and jump scares to try and get a cheap jump out of the audience. This movie gets under your skin and stays there. Personally, horror movies don't typically scare me, but I had to watch 2 palate cleanser movies afterwards to get the rotten taste out of my mouth (She's the Man and 10 Things I Hate About You, and rotten taste is a good thing). This movie is truly chilling to its core, which is a great contrast to most horror movies released today.",10,3,6,8 June 2019
