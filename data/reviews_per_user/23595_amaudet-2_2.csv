Black Swan," Pure Genius.
","This film is pure genius.From the trailer I thought it was going to be a suspenseful thriller. I believed this until the part in the movie where I was so horrified I couldn't look away from the screen.Everything about this film is executed flawlessly and effortlessly and with ballet as the backdrop for this masterpiece, it makes sense to those who know the beauty of ballet - what makes ballet capable of making inclined human hearts pound as their eyes feast on the astounding feats being performed before them is that it is EFFORTLESS.To not see this film would be to deny yourself a true experience. I hope that everyone will recognise what Aronofsky has given to his audience and that, as I have said before yet feel can never be said enough about this film is a MASTERPIECE.",10,2,5,27 January 2011
Shutter Island," What a waste of time! CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!
","I don't know where to start with how this movie was not just bad, but barely watchable.I'll start with the editing, which was atrocious. Discontinuity in shots that I hoped were for on purpose for plot reasons, but was never confirmed. Sometimes it was obvious that a shot wasn't done in one take - a hand on the left shoulder from one angle became a hand on a hip in another. But that's just for starters.The concept of the film was largely taken from an old silent film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (sp?), which is a far superior film. The other movies it seemed to steal from include a) The Wicker Man, b) Gothika, c) Identity, and d) from too many Hitchcock films to be named.Another big problem I had with this film was that it didn't let you become scared. It told you to be. There were too many scenes that didn't pan out and seemed like it was there for fear value. For example, the scene in the cemetery. They didn't find anybody there, but then again they didn't really look. All of the sudden the island was on the brink of a hurricane and they had to abandon the crypt they were forced to hide in. Nothing came of that scene and when the car pulls up to the gate apparently the weather isn't so bad or the guards are just highly undervalued as they're out and about and opening gates.Not worth watching in my opinion.",2,9,19,14 April 2010
