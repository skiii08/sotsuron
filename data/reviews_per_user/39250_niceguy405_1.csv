50 First Dates," Music Question from the Movie???
","Hello, I have seen the movie '50 First Dates' and have listened to the soundtrack but still can't find a certain song played in the movie? I have been searching for the last few days for this song and can't seem to find it anywhere! I hope that someone could point me in the right direction? In the movie there's part of a song playing at 15min and 50sec's into the movie for about 9 sec's, when Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler are dancing outside there cars in front of the cafe! It's kind of like a choir playing. If you can help in anyway, it's greatly appreciated!
