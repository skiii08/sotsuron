The Sound of Music," this is an awesome movie!
","I've always loved musicals, and this movie is a great example of a great musical. It has great songs and great scenery (and awesome reviews!) and a great cast. Julie Andrews is an awesome actress (my personal favorite) and she did an awesome job. Some of my friends don't like it because they say it's too sappy or too sing-songy or too young, but it's got a wonderful plot and it's not too sappy at all, and I don't think that two people falling in love makes for a young movie at all. Some people I know don't like My Fair Lady for the same reason (did you know that Sister Sophia, the nun with the cute face, is the singing voice for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady?) but I adore My Fair Lady, too, though not as much as Sound of Music. Henry Higgins and Eliza fall in love but neither one really wants to admit it, because Henry Higgins said he'd never fall in love and is too proud to take back his words, and Eliza is understandably exasperated with his complacency and rudeness. Almost the same, the captain and Maria fall in love, but neither wants to admit it, Maria because she is training to be a nun and if she becomes one she can't have him and is a bit confused by her feelings, and the captain because he's engaged to the Baroness. (How he ever fell in love with Baroness Schraeder to begin with with somebody as gorgeous and nice as Maria right there is beyond me, but hey, all men are kind of stupid at times.) I just love this movie.",10,3,10,25 February 2005
