The Lobster," Not worth the ugliness
","Vicious animal cruelty used flippantly to add some kind of edge to an otherwise soulless film.I like all kinds of movies, but...***SPOILER***...having a dog get brutally beaten to death in your film just for effect isn't art, it's just sick.***END SPOILER***This is one of very few movies I left wishing I had never seen. Might have been of passing interest as a short film. There's simply not enough of substance or style in this movie to begin to justify the (unpleasant) experience of watching it.",1,152,279,23 December 2015
