Insidious: Chapter 2," Mind-bogglingly SCARY!
","Inspite of the attempt to explain why certain events happened, Insidious: Chapter 2 still left me with so many questions and made me want to watch the first installment again. James Wan once again did it! He surprised us with a well-preserved story line but lacks strong effective scares (character definition). Just as same with his word-of-mouth movie hit this year 'The Conjuring', it is a legit horror flick with a little intriguing and confusing twist. I like Insidious: Chapter 2 though because I've seen how the movie had developed its characters and the fact that he was able to cleverly interlinked the movie (but in a messy way). I also like how comical Specs and Tucker could get to balance the vibe. But Wilson (Josh Lambert) is his favorite, so be it! Overall, the movie did not disappoint nor impress me, but took me on a horror ride between what's real and who's not.",9,1,3,18 September 2013
