United 93," Wow...
","I just got finished watching this movie on PPV. I had been wanting to see it, but hadn't had the chance to. This movie kept me riveted to my seats, and if there was ever a seat gripper of a movie it was this one. I saw flight 93 on A&E, and thought this was the more superior movie, especially when it came to the storming of the cockpit by the passengers. (Or it might be because I was watching it on Surround Sound). I sat their gripping my seat and just watched awestruck at the scene that was played before me. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I kept wanting them to be able to reach the cockpit and save the day...but we all know that didn't happen. The movie was able to show the chaos that happened on September 11, and I can only imagine what the flight controllers were going through, and they must have been out of their minds because of all the confusion. My only complaint is that I wished they would have had some scenes of the people who were talking to the passengers on the plane instead of just the passengers...but the movie was so great that I was able to look over it. This is a must see movie for everyone. I just hope that if i'm in a situation similar to this (god willing), I'll be able to react with the courage that the passengers and crew did on that fateful day.",10,1,3,25 December 2006
The Rookie," Great movie!
","I just saw this movie tonight, opening night. It was great!! I'm a big fan of sports movies, and this was right up there as one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read this...my sister lives in Austin, where you live.....and she was supposed to buy you a drink once...well...she kinda stood you up...but she didn't mean to! :C) [not that anyone's going to believe that...]) ANYWAY, it's a great movie. Everyone who likes a good sports movie, should go out and see it! :C)",10,0,0,29 March 2002
Ratatouille," Delight
","Okay, I admit, I haven't seen an animated film in a theatre in a long time...but when I saw the previews for this I thought it looked cute, had nothing else to do, bought a ticket and went in and saw it. I was extremely pleased with what I saw. The animation was great...the characters were cute. (What can I say? I have a fondness for rats, I had a pat rat myself when I was younger). It almost had an 'American Tail' feel at the beginning. Delightful to watch, and some really funny parts in it. The kids will love this, and if it's doesn't win an award for best animated feature, something is definitely wrong with the Academy.",10,4,5,1 July 2007
