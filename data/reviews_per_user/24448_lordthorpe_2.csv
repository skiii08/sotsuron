Angels & Demons," Very Poor attempt
","I read Dan Browns books before any of the films were made. I had low expectations for this film after seeing the mess that was made of the Da Vinci Code - unfortunately my expectations wern't low enough! I walked out early! This film is a mess, key events and characters from the book are missing, the plot in the book is tight and crisp with the ending very well written. In this film the characters are wooden, almost cartoonish, & the plot unbelievable, the sound quality is poor, with characters being inaudable due to background noise.The only redeeming actor is Ewan Mcgregor - who turns in his usual excellent performance.Ron Howard & Tom Hanks should apologise for this mess - they can do so much better.If this film was a new car, you would demand your money back. Please save the planet and don't transfer this mess to DVD.",1,3,9,20 June 2009
Star Trek," Absolutely Brilliant!
","I grew up with the original Star Trek - Jim Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty etc, were all part of my childhood – so I approached this remake with some trepidation.I absolutely loved it! The casting was pretty much spot on, there were some goofs (such as Mr Chekov) but they were easily forgiven. The story line was quite clever allowing the original series and this new series to co-exist using the same characters.The special effects and action scenes are as you would expect for the 21st Century – fast paced, brilliantly executed and edge-of–your seat. You were into the thick of the action from the start but there was sufficient time for good character development and storyline.If this is the beginning of a new series of Star Trek then all I can say is 'Live long and prosper'.",10,9,23,10 May 2009
