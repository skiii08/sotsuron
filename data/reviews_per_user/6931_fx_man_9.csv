Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Much better than the naysayers think!!
","I was 12 years old when Star Wars came out.  It blew me away. Then I grew up (you do the math :-))  The Phantom Menace brought back memories.  It also brought into focus the main storyline of the entire Star Wars saga by introducing many of the characters who will become central in episodes IV-VI.  And therein lies the interest in this film.  In all honesty it could not stand on its own as a separate movie.  Why?  Because its main purpose is to set up the next two episodes, and ultimately tie in to the first film that introduced us to Luke, Han, Leia, Obi-Wan, and the droids.I felt that the film was anchored by the fledgling relationship between the Queen and young Anakin and the re-emergence of the dark lords of the Sith. There were more questions raised than answered, and while the movie was by no means perfect, it was a worthy and successful Episode 1.I am disappointed in the criticisms leveled against the film.  Why? Because I believe most of them are invalid and spring from a lack of understanding or at least a willingness to accept that at the heart of this film lie 2 kids!!  No Han here!  Just get over it.  It's different.  As it should be.Finally, Williams' music is for the most part outstanding.  It is a change of direction and pace from the music in the first three films as he masterfully weaves together new themes with themes from the previous trilogy.  Note the imperial march making an appearance in Anakin's theme.  Also note the musical 'overlap' between Queen Amidala's and Anakin's theme.  These are but a couple of observations.In all, this movie delivers and one has to view it through the eyes of a child.  And that's not a bad thing.  We may have grown up but the story was written over 20 years ago.  Remember that. I cannot wait for the next 2 installments.  The possibilities are amazing.I just wish the critics and some hardcore fans expecting a retread of the first trilogy (quit whining about the new characters) would look at the movie for what it is and discover the subtle elements in it, which by the way are plentiful.  At no point did I feel that Lucas either compromised or had become conceited thinking only of toys and merchandising.  The film has plenty of heart, and stays true to the spirit of the originals, thus the saga itself.I've already seen the flick twice and I will probably go see it again.  9 out of 10.",7,0,0,22 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," South Park:Fouler, Over the Top and Still Funny
","As Stan Marsh himself would say: 'Dude! This is pretty f****d up right here!'  And that describes this movie.  Never have I cringed and laughed so hard all during the same film.  Parker and Stone manage to be vulgar, funny, outlandish, funny, gross, funny, extremely disgusting, funny, childish, funny, inordinately blasphemous, funny and just plain rude, all within 90 minutes.  And oh, did I mention the film was funny?  Many critics were right in their assessment that beneath the crude and crass exterior hides a surprisingly witty satire that takes aim at everything from our preconceived notions of right and wrong to the hypocritical attitude we have towards the media.  The film spares no one and in the process provides some truly hilarious moments.  Unfortunately many of the gags are unnecessarily vulgar to the point of being downright embarrassing, but then again, that's probably the point.  Maybe...  The musical numbers are a hoot, especially the duo with Terrance and Philip with a rather peculiar musical bent.  I'm still trying to decide whether or not to recommend this film.  It is definitely not for everybody, and ABSOLUTELY NOT for kids.  They wouldn't understand the humour and the extremely foul language and vulgarity taken out of context would certainly give them all the wrong ideas.  This is an ADULT film in every sense of the word.  If you're a fan of the show, go see it.  Otherwise spend your money elsewhere.",9,0,0,3 July 1999
The Day After Tomorrow," Sadly, very boring. Almost fell asleep twice. *minor spoilers*
","***** very minor spoilers below *****I enjoyed Stargate.  I enjoyed ID4.  I even liked Godzilla.  Yes, I am here to tell you that I found all three Emmerich directed films listed above entertaining.  Many would strongly argue that none of those films were entertaining.  Nonetheless I had a great time watching them and I could watch them again.Along comes The Day After Tomorrow, a snooze-fest of epic proportions, parading the worst cliches of the disaster movie genre, sloppy and sappy and downright idiotic towards the end.  I was so disappointed. Fortunately I saw the film with a rambunctious enough crowd, which provided a great MST3K atmosphere complete with people hollering at the screen, whooping and even standing up cheering when Laura hugged Sam to 'warm him up with her body heat'.  The entire theatre lost it and was laughing for a good minute.
I understand that films like TDAT are not supposed to be taken seriously, but lines such as 'it's pulling down super cool air from the upper troposphere' would trigger howling laughter in even the laziest of brains. And worst of all, the film was boring.  The spectacle isn't that awe-inspiring anymore, we've seen most of this before. 
Spectacular FX have become commonplace.  It's time to start taking screenwriting seriously again.  I mean REAL seriously.  I don't need to plunk down $8.00 to fall asleep.  I can easily fall asleep for free.  Shame on Emmerich for being such a lazy bum.",5,0,1,29 May 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Breathtaking
","A simple review: the film is breathtaking in its scope and depth. It may not be exactly what Tolkien imagined but I would think that it comes very close, and as a film it succeeds on all levels. The viewer does not merely watch but participates in Frodo Baggins' mission, and not once but many times he is overcome with emotion. This could very well be the most beautifully realised film this, or any, year and it deserves all the critical praise it has been getting. And more... I want to see Peter Jackson up on that podium in March! This is a grand cinematic gift that deserves to be recognised. It is the first time I have been truly enchanted watching a movie since I was a kid.",10,0,0,21 December 2001
Spider-Man," Raimi and Koepp got it right!
","One of - if not THE - best comic book movie to come along yet.  Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe live their respective roles and the script grows out of the development of the main characters themselves.  As a result the film finds a down to earth tone that belies its larger than life hero and comes across as a true coming of age story.  Filled with genuine emotions, thrills and great fx (some of the shots of Spidey swinging from skyscraper to skyscraper are almost awe-inspiring in their choreographed beauty) this is a bona-fide hit, one that not only avoids insulting its audience but manages to treat it to what a real adventure movie is supposed to be like.",8,0,0,7 May 2002
The Exorcist," Interesting how the reactions this movie elicits are so strong!
","I see some people who claim to be writers take the opportunity to make this a forum for their hate-propaganda against what they call 'christians.' This ignorant attitude blinds them to what makes this film so great. It is by far one of the most thought provoking and effective chillers ever made. It covers the gamut from faith to God to the devil to puberty to parental dedication and scientific understanding and how we humans grapple with these issues. A deeply emotional study of the human psyche and the human being. And another thing: the movie doesn't scare you because it was made in 1973? Well, I guess being desensitized to violence has its effects.This film isn't meant to shock as so many viewers and even critics seem to think so. Not at all. A quick look at Friendkin's other films clearly demonstrates why. What's the scariest thing about the Exorcist is how many people just don't seem to get it.",10,0,2,27 September 2000
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Demented and decrepit bore...
","I never thought a Tarantino film could be boring.  He has proven me wrong. Having read about the subject matter of Kill Bill I had my reservations from the onset, but a friend rightly pointed out that unless viewed, a film has not been given a fair shake. Indeed.  After having fulfilled my 'duty' I can say without blinking an eye that I will not watch Volume 2 of this massive, self-indulgent bore.  I am neither squeamish nor a novice to Hong-Kong chop-sokey, Japanese martial arts films, the oeuvre of Kinji Fukasaku or any of the multitude of 70's genre films and B-offerings.  Maybe that is the reason I could hardly stay awake.  Obviously many critics will heap praise on Kill Bill and maybe even write books about how it carries a pop-culture angst drenched subtext, blabbering effusively about the genius of filmdom's premier geek.  If this is sufficient for them, so be it.The moment I heard Herrmann's famously tormented theme from Twisted Nerve I knew trouble was coming.  If you take away the gore, the fighting, the ridiculously presented code of the warrior and the escalatingly embarrassing pop-culture references ('Trix is for kids' - good grief, that's supposed to be clever and funny?) we are left with nothing more than a grinning Tarantino who knows very well that he has pulled yet another one over most everyone's eyes.Steve Oedekirk's 'Kung Pow: Enter the Fist' was a funnier and more cohesive experiment along the same lines, demonstrating how one may hit its targets while being way over the top without ever taking itself seriously.  And from the looks and feel of it I'd venture to say that Oedekirk actually understands his source material ten times better than Tarantino ever will. That spells trouble for a filmgeek whose only forte is recycling old genres and splicing together portions of his favourite films to the point where he actually resorts to directing entire sequences - and more than a few - to original scores written for other movies.As much as I loved Pulp Fiction, I have to say that this emperor has no clothes.  Tarantino is a one-trick pony whose act has worn thin.",1,11,19,12 October 2003
Paranormal Activity," Over-hyped and underwhelming
","Just like the Blair Witch Project, this film has been turned into a 'phenomenon' by savvy marketing folks who know a goose that lays golden eggs when they see one. I am sure that half-drunk college students in a dark, crowded theatre may possibly be freaked out by some of what happens in Paranormal Activity. Hell, after someone's had a few pints and maybe a joint or two, getting in his/her face yelling 'boo!' would achieve the desired effect.However, any sober person trying to convince me that there is anything remotely frightening, clever, or original about this movie is most definitely one of said savvy marketing folks. If you can suspend your disbelief about when and under what circumstances a halfway intelligent person would walk around his house lugging a somewhat bulky camcorder, refusing to relinquish it and put it down no matter how dire the situation and how badly his significant other needs help, then you might be able to sit through this cavalcade of boredom. Otherwise, you'll constantly be thinking to yourself how anyone could be this dumb and unaware.Successful fright fests tap deep into one's psyche. The problem with Paranormal Activity is that while it's attempting to do just that, it is simply not well executed. The conceit of the 'home footage' doesn't work because the protagonists do things that ordinary people just wouldn't do. If the idea is that this is found footage of a couple who were taping some weird events at their house, then you need to write a screenplay in which the couple behaves in a believable manner, one that audience members can identify with. I shudder at the thought of thinking that audience members would identify with the couple in the film.The wholly unrealistic reactions of the actors in what is supposed to be a hyper-realistic setting immediately neutralises the documentary feel, which is central to the film, and yanks the audience (well, at least this writer) out of the movie. After witnessing the implausible behaviour of the leads in the face of what they were experiencing, boredom began to set in. I was no longer watching 'found footage', I was watching a contrived and amateurish movie.I can understand how the movie has become popular at colleges, considering the state of mind required of one to remotely enjoy this movie. But there are many other such communal experiences that don't work outside the very specific milieu in which they find success. Consequently, as a film that stands on its own, Paranormal Activity is inconsequential and flaccid. It doesn't frighten and only occasionally holds one's interest.I was disappointed because I wanted to have a good time, and I believed the hype. At least it was a matinÃ©e.",4,2,5,16 October 2009
The Mummy Returns," Spectacular and empty...
","Spectacular and extremely well made, and also suffering from lack of a coherent plot (though the story itself is interesting) and some of the worst acting to come along in a long, long time. The director, Stephen Sommers, must have had all his time taken up with directing the action and helping with the camera set-ups because he sure didn't spend much time on any of the characters. Brendan Frasier sleepwalks through this one and the little kid needs to take some serious acting lessons, quickly!  Rachel Weisz is ok as are the villains, but it's all so over the top and at times so overbearingly cutesy that you cannot help but to wish for Hollywood to release a real film sometime.  This is an overwrought video game blown up to 35mm film.Check your brain at the door and don't expect any halfway interesting characters.  Expect lots of CGI and noise, though. Some of which is worth a matinee price.  But that's about it.",Null,0,0,7 May 2001
