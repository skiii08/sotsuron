The New World," Artistic but without an end-meaning
","I am not such a great fan of Colin Farrell's acting skills, mainly because he always looks like he is on drugs (although he did a great job in Daredevil), but putting this aside. The New World is a nice movie if you have the patience to watch a movie that shows a lot of nature and is told as a story about love and ends with conflict in love. The story lines are partially based on different true stories but is not put together very well. There are only a few scenes that have any meaning towards the story line as a hole. The ending of the movie is also quite bland and empty and left me and my friends left very unsatisfied.",1,0,4,2 September 2006
Mulholland Drive," Script totally cryptic, director way in over his head
","A terrible waste of time. Starts out with a lot of promise & degrades into a vision of confusion, lack of direction and long slow meaningless scenes.You won't be able to stop watching. But only because you want to know what it all means. At the end, you still won't know, but will be extremely annoyed at having bothered to watch it at all.Indeed in this long list of reviews there are many pretentious reviews which claim this to be some sort of masterpiece 'that even Hitchcock would be proud of'. (what an insult to Hitchcock !!). don't be fooled. Unless you like completely weird movies, which make no sense, have no continuity, you will waste 2 hours of your life watching it and another 2 hours asking yourself 'why did I waste my time watching that complete piece of trash'.David Lynch should stop wasting film and get a job he is more suited for.. perhaps cleaning floors or street sweeping. The only part of the movie that is any good (assuming you like nude scenes of two women together). is that scene with the two women. Even that turns into something stupid.",1,4,12,12 May 2003
