Moneyball," Great touching film
","Think Jeremy Maguire with less heart, let's face it you can't anymore heart in a movie than JM.
Brad Pitt is the general manager of poor but over achieving baseball team. When he meets Jonah Hill during a transfer meeting with another team he introduced to whole new way of recruitment and winning by using statistics. The whole concept is interesting as it's based on a true story but the stellar cast have you hooked and give the movie real feeling as the underdogs try to achieve glory.",7,1,1,27 March 2020
Hereditary," What did I just watch?
","A grieving family are haunted after a seance.
Good points... fantastic cast and acting.
Bad points..... the story is horrific with little structure or any decent explanations. Gore used to distract from these facts.
Horror fans avoid.",3,2,3,15 June 2020
John Wick," Excellent
","An ex hitman and a boogeyman story amongst criminals is brought out of retirement to do what he does best when idiot criminals steal his car and kill the dog his recently deceased wife gave him as a present. John then proves why he is boogeyman story to the underworld and absolute legend in his field as a now not retired hitman.
The action is relentless which normally bores me but this is done with a certain class and the film also holds onto the emotional element to its credit. A great watch.",8,0,1,4 January 2020
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Very funny and heart warming
","Peter (Jason Segal) splits from his TV star girlfriend Sarah Marshall who cheats and breaks his heart. To get over her he goes on vacation to Hawaii but staying at the same resort is Sarah Marshall snd her new boyfriend the rock star Aldus Snow who is brilliantly played by Russell Brand.
The supporting cast is impressive and the scenery is terrific.
Fun and adult humour from start to finish.",9,0,0,20 January 2020
Us," Pretty bad
","I struggled to like much in this. Good cast but performed badly in large parts with over acting to try and be scary being the worst thing.
The Plot started well and was intriguing but the more it went on on I actually found it laughable. By the time it hit a big a twist at the end I didn't care. Plus point of the film was the child actors were impressive.",4,125,200,25 March 2019
Creed," The Rocky drama is back!!
","Adonis Johnson, the illegitimate son of former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, tries to make it as a boxer and after several knockbacks seeks mentorship from Rocky Balboa, his father's old friend and rival.
Michael B Jordan is fantastic and has great chemistry with Tessa Thompson (Bianca) Who he falls for and with Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) who he lovingly calls 'Unc'.
When the boxing world learns that the legendary Apollo Creed had a son and even more so is being taught to fight by Rocky the world eats it up. Adonis is challenged by the undefeated, hot headed champion and after speaking to a reluctant Rocky, Adonis accepts. Rocky and Adonis prepare for the almost impossible fight whilst also fighting another almost impossible fight they were not expecting. Again like all Rocky films the emotions are high and the action is exciting.
HOW SYLVESTER STALLONE DID NOT WIN BEST SUPPORTING OSCAR IN 2015 IS UNBELIEVABLE?????",9,1,1,21 December 2019
Interstellar," Great acting, good effects and a bit complicated
","With the earth on the brink of dying a group of explorers head to a wormhole in space where they believe there is a new home for the human race.
The cast is first rate and therefore the touching moments and action are done with a first class touch. The only minus for me and it might be my limited understanding in science is there where parts I just didn't get.
But overall a very good blockbuster.",7,0,0,18 April 2020
Rocky II," Just edges the first round
","Despite losing to the world champion Apollo Creed, boxer Rocky Balboa earns the respect of people from his field. An embarrassed Creed over not being able to defeat Rocky easily demands a rematch.
A touch more family drama and sentiment than the first film and when Adrian (Talia Shire) tells Rocky to win giving her blessing, your hairs stand on end as the excitement is ready to start. The climax to the fight leaving you breathless. Fantastic.",10,0,0,21 December 2019
Bird Box," Mysterious and gripping
","Sandra Bulllock is back! To be fair she has help from a wonderful supporting cast but top work all round.
A mysterious illness/creature makes people who see it kill themselves in quite dramatic fashion in most cases.
Bullock and her family survive wearing blindfolds as they try to evade the mysterious evil.
The film has you asking questions but not enough to frustrate you and the storytelling is good enough to keep you interested. A good little thriller.",7,0,1,29 October 2019
Rocky IV," Rocky takes on Russia
","Rocky trains his retired friend Apollo Creed in an ill advised match against the imposing monster Ivan Drago, an indestructible Russian boxer. But when Apollo is killed in the ring during the match and Rocky is blamed for not throwing in the towel, Rocky vows to avenge his friend's death. Only problem the fight has to be in Russia. The film also adds humour with one of the funniest scenes I've seen in an action movie... as Rocky prepares to enter the intimidating Russian arena which is baying for his blood Paulie pulls Rocky to one side and tells him in a very touching moment 'if I could unzip myself and step out and be someone else, I'd wanna be you. You're all heart, Rock. (Paulie Hugs and kisses Rocky on the cheek) as they get in the ring and the imposing Drago is stood there, Paulie comes out with 'that thing I just said? Forget it'
As with the previous films the emotion is raw and the action is thrilling.",9,0,0,21 December 2019
Goon," Hilarious underdog story
","Seann William Scott again proves there is so much more to his talent than playing Steve Stifler.
Doug Glatt (Scott) is given the opportunity of a lifetime to improve his life by joining a professional Ice Hockey team team struggling for positive results as their enforcer.
The locker room humour is hilarious, Glatt's innocent personality is charming as he tries to win over his love interest. The supporting cast is immensely talented with Jay Baruchel in particular bring hilarious. Finally the action and fight scenes are incredible with Liev Schreiber playing an incredible part as Glatt's foe Ross The Boss Rheah.
It's a must see for any sports and action fans.",10,0,0,30 June 2020
Jerry Maguire," Heart warming
","Jerry Maguire a successful sports agent is fired from his job for exposing the alleged illegal practices that exist in his profession. Jerry Maguire starts his own agency taking with him his only employee Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) However, he manages to find only one client in the Oscar winning (best supporting actor) Cuba Gooding Jnr. The chemistry between Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jnr is phenomenal as they battle sports politics and life problems to get a new contract for the football playing Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jnr). Cruise and Zellweger are also excellent as their relationship grows.
If this movie doesn't move you then you don't have a heart.
Masterclass of an emotional rollercoaster with world class acting.",10,0,1,22 December 2019
The Adjustment Bureau," No free will?
","A chance meeting is pretty much love at first sight for Matt Damon and the stunning Emily Blunt. But someone is keeping them apart....but why??? They're not supposed to be together, again why? I won't spoil the film with those answers but it's mysterious and exciting.
Watch and find out. Great film",8,0,1,9 November 2019
Drag Me to Hell," Everything you could want in an horror
","When a loan officer refuses an extension to an old gypsy woman the gypsy curses the bank employee with lamia demon to drag her in to hell.
This horror as everything except any unnecessary gore. Creeps, suspense, twists, jumps and a bit of Sam Raimi humour. Very impressed, the acting crew were first class and the old hag of gypsy would give anyone nightmares! She definitely deserved hitting in the face with a frying pan although it looked like that might have already happened.",8,0,0,13 March 2020
Rocky," Superb drama and action
","Rocky Balboa, a small-time boxer, gets a chance to fight heavyweight champion Apollo Creed. Who would turn it down? certainly not Rocky earning $40 a fight normally and that's if he wins. But what chance does he have against the Creed? (brilliantly played by Carl Weathers)
A fantastic underdog story which is not short on sentiment and drama which is equalled with the action.",9,0,0,21 December 2019
Rocky III," Hard to follow 1st 2 but does well
","Rocky, the reigning world champion, accepts a boxing challenge from Clubber Lang (Mr T) and loses the match. He also ends up losing any credibility as a fighter and turns to an unlikely ally to completely change his style in order to beat the new champion. Instead of romance we have a bromance between Rocky and Creed and it works brilliantly. Once again exciting matches and heartfelt drama.",8,3,3,21 December 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," It's all in the title
",A soldier fighting in a war against an unstoppable alien race relives the same battle after being killed day after day. You get first class acting as always with Cruise and Blunt. Non stop action which is gripping until the end.,7,0,0,9 November 2019
Creed II," Brilliant and touching
","I didn't they could top the first 'Creed' film but they certainly equalled it.
Adonis Creed now the heavyweight champion of the world gets challenged by the son of Ivan Drago who killed his father in the ring (Rocky 4).
Michael B Jordan, Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson pull at your heartstrings again with brilliant performances and a word has to be said for Dolph Lundgren who captivates without saying much.
The film is full of emotion, great acting and great action",9,2,2,19 December 2019
Signs," Suspense and genius
","What a film!!!!
M N Shalyman......i like half of his films whilst the other half truly awful. This is his finest work in my humble opinion.
Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are superb with Rory Culkin showing his sibling how it's really done.
The story centres round former vicar (Gibson) who has lost all faith in god and finds his farm and family under alien attack.
Gripping and suspenseful are perfect ways to describe your journey through this story.
Without spoilers as everything comes together at the end it's pure genius and truly exciting and uplifting.
Any film fan should watch this and like me watch it again and again",9,1,2,30 October 2019
Get Him to the Greek," Hilarious
","In a fantastic spin off from Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Aaron (Jonah Hill) working for pinnacle records gets the assignment of his dreams when he has to escort his drug addicted alcoholic rock star hero Aldus Snow (Russell Brand) to a anniversary concert.
Partying all the way the adult humour starts from the first scene and never lets up. The chemistry between Brand and Hill works perfectly to deliver this hilarious comedy.
On a side note.....the furry wall scene is one of the funniest things I've seen on the screen.",8,1,1,20 January 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," Very good but nothing new on first film
",John Wick is forced back to the criminal underground to repay an old debt and in doing so soon finds a large bounty on his head. As John fights off the worlds deadliest killers sent after him the film somewhat lacks the sentiment of the first film but the action is equally as good as the first one. The fight scenes differ from other blood and guts action movies as the action sequences have a class and elegant choreography that is rarely seen.,7,0,0,4 January 2020
