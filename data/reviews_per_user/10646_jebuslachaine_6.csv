It," it seen it saw it was awesome
",just got to see this movie last night and omg it was awesome the film is the first chapter of the book. I came into the film as a skeptic and was blown away by how dam good it was. the clown was very well done and surpassed tim curry. the only thing i have to say that was bad was the cgi in it but its not as bad as some of the cgi in horror films. the acting was well places and you can really feel the kids realness. it has some good jump scares that even me got me to jump. im not going to give out spoilers and stuff like that. i really recommend it to any horror or stephen king fan out there if u liked the 1990s version u will be in for a very good surprise on this one. it does drag a lil but its not to the point where u fall asleep(unless ur like my sister LOL) but it was well done.,8,3,8,10 September 2017

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," star sucks is a better title
",I seen thils trash 2 times and still it sucks more then luke sucking on an alien tit WTF was the wrighters thinking is all i still keep asking !>!!>!>!?!?!?!? everything as bad and seeing it the second time was just even more questionable i thought i might have missed something anything that can redeem its self from what there was or is depends on who was watching it only ppl that will enjoy this are the kids who are 10 or younger one for the porgs( disneys idea of something other then ewoks) and all the dam stupid jokes that dont land and dont even hit on home with anyone only thing remotly funny was how leha can just simply get blasted from a bridge of the ship then just simply go oh ya i have the force and simply float back and knock yes knock on a door and be like im ok rey was a full blown mary sue and disney has made it like the force is gender based also with rey she some how can best everyone even though shes had half assed been traind if u can even call it that it is like heres a light saber just wave ioit around and bam ur a jedi also luke is made as a coward that just sits on his island in utter fear and becomes a hologram at the end where the real luke just dissipears into nothing like WHAT !?!?!?!?!?!? so in closing avoid at all costs unless ur with someone willing to fork it out for ya to see it,1,2,4,3 January 2018
Bram Stoker's Dracula," a true classic
",Truly my all time fave movie ever love everything about it there is no point giving out spoilers cuz everyone seen this one but if u never seen this film before I strongly recommend it to anyone that loves a good storyline. It has its flaws but there excuseable with just how things were done so well its not fully action packed and a bit slow to get things going (like a old ford lol) but once it starts going it don't stop also the acting is not bad either Its a shame they never made a follow up to what happened after cuz there was a book that was a continuation to the film any way off topic and such lolSo sit back grab some popcorn and enjoy a true classic at its best,8,0,3,29 July 2016
Pitch Perfect 3," where was the plot???
","Well me and my gf went to the movies last night and went to see this mess 
now where do i start well like all crap movies they have to have some plot that well dont really matter at first off there was really no plot except the two idiots that followed them around and be like ya were filing ur documentry and the women were like they were not even aware of it (i dono dont ask) second the plot where fat amy had her father going around and trying to be all mr nice guy but he was really after her money she had...and thats pretty much the movie it had a lot of stupid dancing and crap dancing OMG the stang off scene just never ended it was almost 30 mins of everyone doing some stupid thing or another and totally sucked with it all i had no idea what hell was going on.......
the movie was not at all funny and it just felt like there was way too much 
thing going on that felt they should have not added 
so with that all said if ur into a lot and i do mean a lot of dancing and crap music that just sucks then by all means go see it ........",2,23,37,7 January 2018
