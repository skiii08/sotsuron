The Blair Witch Project," More hype than Phantom Menace
","We waited about 5 months for this film to get to Australia, and you know what, it wasn't worth the wait. Even the underwhelming Star Wars ep.1 wasn't this much of a disappointment. Is it well acted? Yeah, mostly. Does it look 'real'? Well it *does* look like they're wandering in the woods... Is it plausible or realistic? Well.. no, not really - do teenagers really react that way to things that go bump in the night - I dont think so! Is it SCARY? Well, er.. no frankly it isn't. I tried to be scared, really I did, but I've seen plenty of TV movies that were a lot better at scaring me than this mediocre film. And lastly, was it boring? Unfortunately, yes it was, at least a lot of the time. I think the only thing that was true was the effect of the handheld camera - I dont get affected by that sort of thing, but my partner felt quite sick by the end of the film. The biggest let-down of the year, overall.",5,0,2,22 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Take off the rose-coloured glasses & listen to the critics!
","Hey, this is NOT the best film ever made, despite what you might read elsewhere in the IMDb. Just because people have waited 16 years for a sequel doesnt mean any bit of celluloid with the Star Wars logo is worthy of adulation. Where is the Star Wars excitement or grand design? OK the pod race was exciting, but there was more to Ben Hur than a chariot race, George. Not one of the Star Trek films, oft-criticised for their slow pacing, is as limp or un-involving as this film. If this is meant to set the scene for Episode 2, then we could have had a 45 min. short with all the necessary detail. Everything else is just padding, and pretty unentertaining padding at that.",6,0,1,7 July 1999
Fight Club," Gratuitous violence in search of a message
","I don't think I've ever been put off a film by its violent content .. until this one. You come out of it feeling like you've been swimming in a tub full of offal. After two hours or so it really starts to become boring, which is disturbing in itself. After it finished though, and I got the more disgusting images out of my mind somewhat, I thought, it really doesn't make much sense either - did anyone ever hear of data backups, maybe? and just how do you wire up a condemned old house for a heap of electronic gismos to conduct a urban warfare campaign? Cronenberg manages all the creepiness and shocking images (e.g. Videodrome) without stooping to the goriness that this film revels in.",3,2,7,9 January 2000
"Monsters, Inc."," Overrated
","Hah. If it wasnt for the 'out-takes' and other stuff at the end, this would be a very average film, suffering from typical Disney saccharin overdose. It's a pity, given the attention to detail in the animation and sound effects, that they decided all they needed to do was churn out another 'Bug's Life'. Surely once was enough!",7,0,1,7 January 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Is this the Notting Hill for 2001?
","Another sweet-but-painful film labelled as comedy by the marketers, in the style of British films which started with Four Weddings and a Funeral and has continued quite nicely ever since. This is by no means as good as the best of them, but is quite watchable, and shows that Renee, like Gwynneth can do a credible British accent. Its funny how the real actress now resembles what her character calls a 'stick insect', which only shows she didnt take any hints from the screenplay. All the British leads are terrific, of course, and it makes for a experience that this male thought was eminently worthwhile.",8,0,0,18 June 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Most overrated film since Phantom Menace
","C'mon, what is it with this film? Sure it looks pretty, and it has some accomplished stars, but all of them have done better things in other films. Chow Yun-Fat in particular is wasted. Is it a coincidence that audiences in China have not been so impressed by this movie? The stunt sequences are frankly boring, and editing them tightly would have saved about 20 min and made a distinct improvement in the film overall. Go and see this by all means, but don't expect anything extraordinary.",6,0,0,15 February 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Impossibly dumb
","The dumbest film of the year (so far...) Or, is this Tom's promotional film that got lost by his agent and ended up in the wrong can? Whatever it is, to the viewer it's just a really stupid film. Sure, it looks fine on the big screen, but if you want to see it, leave your brain at the door.",3,0,1,19 September 2000
The Mummy Returns," Special effects in search of a story
","Is it possible to fall asleep during an action film with countless explosions, bug-eyed monsters, hectic chases and last-minute escapes? This film just about makes it possible. Never have I seen such overdone, unconvincing and utterly unnecessary SFX. Ten-year old video games have more realism than this. I wonder how the actors went, they must have got sick of cavorting in front of blue screens and dodging monsters who wouldnt appear until post production. I saw this as a double feature along with the first one, which is far more substantial and involving. The acting was ok, but the live action seemed to have less screen time than all the animation. Yawn.",5,0,0,1 July 2001
The Matrix," Wooooo.
","An intelligent action movie. Stylish and thought-provoking. If you go to see it for the special effects, you'll be intrigued by the premise. At times it feels a lot like The Terminator, but the plot is not really that similar. However this film is also likely to become a cult classic too. Overall an immensely satisfying cinema experience.",9,0,0,12 April 1999
Thirteen Days," Historical thriller diluted by melodrama
","If only this film had been made by someone else. It suffers from an excess of 'Costerism'. Here we have the President of the mighty U.S. of A. being told what to do by his assistant? I wonder what the real Kenny thought of being promoted to be the C-in-C's boss? This silliness detracts from the real drama being played out by the Kennedy duo, trying to stop the unpredictable Ruskies and prevent the mad generals from staging their own version of Dr. Strangelove. I rather doubt the accuracy of their portrayal too; they are a little too red-faced, blustering and over-the-top to be in a straight drama. I wish I'd liked this more, but these things just niggle all the way through.",6,0,0,14 May 2001
Gladiator," Not one of Ridley's best
","If you don't like this film after the first half hour you'd better leave and save yourself another hour or two - it goes on & on and doesn't improve with age. This is an epic with no heart and soul - lots of oh-so-evil bad guys and goody-two-shoes, sweetness & light nice guys. You don't feel much for anyone in it, unlike other modern 'epics' like Braveheart, and computerized SFX or not, it can't hold a candle to the likes of Ben Hur/Spartacus etc. In fact, even the effects are not really all that impressive - and if the acting and script had been better I probably wouldn't have noticed, but I had so much time on my hands that I started trying to guess where the 'real' actors and sets stopped and the 'virtual' ones started. It's not quite like Titanic - the effects are not so impressive, and the acting is nowhere near as awful - but it does unfortunately come to mind. Still, at least go & see it in a decent theatre, it will shrivel away to nothing on the small screen.",6,0,0,25 May 2000
