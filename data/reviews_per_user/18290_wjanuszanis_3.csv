Hereditary," 0/10 nonsense
","How come is that flick over 7.0? The plot is so dumb I can't even find the words to describe it. If that's what 'good' horror movie is nowadays, I'm going to lay off horrors. This thing and that 'Us' movie are 4 hours of life I'm never getting back. Would rate it 0 if that was possible. Worst movie I ever seen, but I'm not American and have good taste so that may be the reason. If pointless violent scenes are rated over 7, there something seriously wrong with people rating it that high. If u want to save 2hours of your life, dont watch it, Spongebob Squarepants makes more sense than this ridiculous flick.",1,5,13,10 July 2019
Us," Like, what is this?
","Seriously, this is hardly watchable :( I've seen films rated worse than 3 that are better than this. I didn't see anything new or thrilling. Another bad horror film that was more hilarious than scary. Thats 2 hours I'm never getting back :(",1,2,2,6 June 2019
Midsommar," Hereditary
","Please lads and lasses, that movie is as close as Hereditary with its stupidity, dont waste 2.5hrs of your life. Its a pointless brutal movie that will leave you with a feeling that you watched something really bad. Dont know how 'Hereditary' and THIS is rated above 7.0. I havent seen worse movies in my entire life.",1,56,98,10 July 2019
