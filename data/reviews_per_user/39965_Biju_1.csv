Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It was like Christmas in May
","When I woke up in the morning of May 19, I sensed something--something I hadn't felt since...1983.  It was a day millions of fans have been waiting many years for.  We will also gladly and impatiently continue to wait for II and III.Finally we get a chance to see the making of the saga.  I was nervous as my friends and I waited in line at the movie theater, and checked my pocket numerous times for my pre-purchased ticket.  I was anxious when the music started, and the words 'Episode 1: The Phantom Menace' scrolled up the screen.  I was also beginning to realize how much water and coffee I had drank that morning.  And as I approached a 'nervous breakdown' state, frantically began to calculate the time it would take me to run to the bathroom and back.Forget about any of the reviews or rumors you've heard.  Overlook the fact that the media says the movie is over-hyped, even though they over-hyped it. This movie is fantastic--for it's plot and visual effects.  If you recall, 'A New Hope' was a very basic (yet fascinating) film plot with great effects.  What made the saga what it is today was the overwhelming detail and intricate universe that surrounds the characters.  It wasn't until 'Empire' that we get thrown into the massive underlying story of the trilogy.  The same will hold true here, as we will all be witness to the creation of modern mythology.I dare the critics who gave this movie a bad review to take another look and read between the lines of this so called 'thin' plot.  The movie already shows structure similar to Star Wars.  Lucas didn't fail in telling a mesmerizing story.  Instead he has built the framework for another trilogy that will end up shocking and amazing you--as did the originals.",7,1,1,19 May 1999
