The Legend of Bagger Vance," Disappointing flick ....
",".... and I didn't have high expectations in the first place. This movie could have been solid, had the plot devices been developed. This would have meant chopping some of the golf footage out, but in my opinion, there was plenty of golf footage to snip. (And I'm an avid fan and participant; I enjoy the sport thoroughly.) The acting was, well, OK (I liked Damon) and yes, the shots were pretty. But why not delve into the subject matter involving Damon's character? Why not examine his horrors? Are we supposed to understand his character by seeing him unshaven, drinking a beer? I've seen many a person look and behave that way without going through combat .... details, please!I'm sorry, but I don't see what was so outstanding about Will Smith's character .... making a bunch of vague statements while driving the locals crazy with his aloof attitude does not make a great role. You want good Will Smith? Watch 'Six Degrees of Separation,' not this. As outrageous as it sounds, Bagger's character meant very little to me in the whole scheme of things, and could have been written out! The child who admired Junuh could've spouted out the same kind of wisdom.On a side note: I could see the boom mic on countless occasions during the first 10 or 15 minutes .... annoying!",Null,3,5,12 November 2000
Requiem for a Dream," Incredible, intense .....
","Putting my opinion into words is a challenge, because I just shut the DVD player off about an hour ago yet my mind hasn't wandered away from the images on the screen -- I haven't come back, as corny or pretentious as that sounds. The bottom line is this: This film tells a story with such poignancy and graphic detail that you wonder how anyone could craft such a work. I was amazed.The four main players (Burstyn, Leto, M. Wayans and Connelly) were all outstanding. Burstyn has been lauded for her efforts, and yes, she probably deserved the statue more so than Julia, and Marlon Wayans surprised me with his performance. Their portrayal of addiction, in one form or another, carried incredible impact without being over the top.The editing was another outstanding aspect. It was concise, not flashy, adding intensity to subject matter that was intense in its own right.I made sure I saw 'Pi' before I watched this, to see the chronological progression of a promising filmmaker. 'Pi' is interesting, quite good; this was amazing. A realistic, if not depressing, look at the downward spiral the less fortunate in the world call life. Darren Aronofsky, I tip my hat.",9,0,0,22 May 2001
Ali," Well, not bad ....
","About 25 minutes in, I thought the movie should have been titled 'Ali + X'.... or 'Ali + X + Cooke.' The Sam Cooke stuff at the beginning didn't serve any purpose for me; I missed the context, I guess.I thought the acting was good. Surprisingly, Smith vanished into the role, in my opinion. For months now, I figured I wouldn't be able to see past 'The Fresh Prince' wearing boxing gloves. Jamie Foxx and Jon Voight were quite good, too.But the storyline seemed to dwell too long on an abbreviated story. I would've liked more on the stuff before 1964 and even more so the stuff after the 'Rumble in the Jungle.' The movie had a somber mood to it, so the decline of The Greatest would have been nice to see. I didn't need to see so much of Malcolm X -- I've read his autobiography and think the connection with Ali could have been made in shorter fashion.Ah well, I didn't expect anything outstanding. I got just what I expected, so what right do I have to complain? It was worth my time, although the lines for Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings added significant time to my box office wait!",Null,0,0,3 January 2002
Training Day," Atypical start, typical finish
","Gosh, don't read this comment if you don't want to hear how bad I thought the ending of the movie was.This movie seemed to have good energy at the beginning, and Washington's character kept Hawke's character and the viewer off-balance during the early scenes. But just when I thought I was going to be pleasantly surprised by this film, the ending plummeted through the basement floor and became ridiculous.Washington and Hawke play intriguing characters -- the former possessing few if any standards of decency (aside from wanting to put away the big, big fish in the pond, by any means necessary), the latter showing blind ambition at first followed by an awakening of beliefs.But then, to tidy things up, I guess, there is an outrageous climax in which the two main characters -- who by this point have become overblown images of themselves -- go toe-to-toe (or face-to-windshield, in one over-the-top instance) and 'good' manages to prevail over 'evil.' With the support of the local urbanites, I might add. Sheesh.Washington wins Oscar for this role? Malcolm X, maybe. I could listen to an argument for his 'Hurricane' Carter. But for this caricature of a 'bad man'? I don't understand it -- or better yet, I do understand it. Pacino's 'Scent of a Woman' nod was the foundation for this sort of award: We passed you by for better roles, so here's your chance. I don't like it, but oh well. I saw this movie before the Oscars, so I shouldn't let that add to my negative feelings toward this movie.Bottom line, in my mind: A good idea that became fatally flawed by the last 20 minutes (give or take a few).",Null,1,11,28 March 2002
Memento," Expectations exceeded
","The idea behind 'Memento' sounded interesting, although I had to wonder how seeing the end of a movie, with each immediately preceding scene to follow, would build any suspense. I was impressed with the way the movie pulled this off.Watching how our 'hero' (Guy Pearce) formed his notes scrawled in the lower margins of Polaroids was a lot of fun. We could read his conclusions, but this movie slowly showed us how he got to them in excellent fashion.
Guy Pearce was the perfect complement for this innovative script. Bad acting would have poisoned something experimental such as 'Memento,' but Pearce gave a great performance. Carrie-Anne Moss and 'Joey Pants' were solid as well.So many little things loomed large once we reach the 'beginning' ... if you are reading this before seeing the movie, pay attention!  One such thing I wrote off to my mind playing tricks on me, only to realize at the 'beginning' that I had seen it as it was .... but to say might spoil things.....This movie is one of the few DVDs I bought BEFORE actually seeing it, and it was worth the risk of shelling out the cash. And then some. Despite having high expectations, this film surpassed them all.",Null,1,3,18 September 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," A nice surprise
","I've rode the South Park roller coaster over the past two years: The first dozen episodes were great, then the initial effect wore off and I got a little bored with the show, and then the movie came about ... and South Park was back on top with this surprisingly funny release. Actually, the humor aspect isn't surprising, but the satire and wit mixed in with the flatulence humor was razor sharp. Sure, the boys said the taboo F-word quite a few times, but there were nice parodies throughout. The musical numbers were quite funny, in my opinion, keeping the movie going for as long as they could. Although the movie is only 80 minutes, it still seemed just a tad too long, but I think it is safe to say that I was laughing for about 75 of those minutes. Terrance and Phillip seem to tickle my funny bone all the time, and having them throughout was good for me. I find it weird that this movie is possibly my favorite movie of the summer; it's easily in the top three. That's something I cannot say about movies I eagerly anticipated (Eyes Wide Shut, The Spy Who Shagged Me, et.al.) I saw this during a matinee, so I agree with the opinion that watching in small setting with less people is probably more enjoyable. Now hopefully the weekly show will not disappoint from here on out...",9,0,0,2 September 1999
Cast Away," One of the few movies of 2000 I thoroughly enjoyed
","The TV spots really did give too much away, wouldn't you say?Despite this, the movie was quite solid. Hanks impressed me with his work on the island, watching his struggles and successes during the ultimate test of survival skills. The mood of the film was nice -- I appreciated the quiet diligence that surrounded all the mundane tasks Hanks had to master shortly after being stranded .... I felt immersed in the solitude Hanks' character was thrust into following the crash.Not only did his behavior seem 'right,' for lack of a better word, but his survival of the brutal plane crash (what a scene!) didn't seem too outlandish. His behavior upon returning to civilization was perfect, too -- the silent nods and gestures given to all the well-wishers who welcomed him back, the impression that he felt crowded -- can you tell I was impressed with his work?!I will agree with the naysayers on one point: Hunt and Hanks have zero chemistry. The best part of their relationship seemed to take place when he was on the island and she was a still picture inside his watch. Well, OK, here's a second point: The 'I'll be right back' line was .... ick. Why bother?Amazing how well (and to such depth) a story can be told without much dialogue. My favorite segment of the movie started at the crash and lasted until the birth of Wilson. I connected with the feelings Hanks was trying to convey through his actions .... very satisfying!I do wonder this: Did you or the people you watched this movie with laugh much during this movie? There was laughter in the theater that I felt was misplaced .... maybe I respected the film too much? Whatever. A good movie in a bad year, but not because it was a bad year. This movie would have held up in most years.",Null,0,0,31 December 2000
American History X," Intriguing, well-casted movie
","I did not see this movie until after Norton received the Oscar nomination, so my expectations were elevated somewhat (I had high standards for Norton to begin with). What I saw once I finally viewed this movie was a rather earnest look at the combination of ignorance and immaturity and how one's thinking evolves with time using a topic that will always draw definite lines: race relations. I still have trouble with the bonding of Norton and his laundry room buddy (all it took was a little 'I miss my woman' thing for Norton to let down his guard?), as it came too easily, and I have a hard time thinking that little guy was going to keep Derek out of trouble with the rest of the black prison population, but hearing Norton's dialogue and sleek casting (Ed Furlong, Fairuza Balk, and Ethan Suplee, as much as I hated his character) more than made up for the questionable bonding. The casting approval extends to the ill Beverly D'Angelo and the 'E/R'-before-George-Clooney's-ER-star Elliott Gould as the teacher.Norton was great, period. Some scenes were chilling, enough to prompt a rating of 9 out of me. The extension of the first scene later in the movie involving the curb .... that still brings flinching obscenities from my mouth. Check this out in the near future.",7,0,0,2 September 1999
Ocean's Eleven," A lot of fun
","This movie was a great way to be entertained for a couple of hours. There are movies that 'wow' a person (Memento, Requiem For A Dream are recent examples for me) and movies that disappoint (too many to list), but this was a well-paced story with great characters that made me smile throughout and not clutter up my mind with deep thoughts afterward. Diversions are nice every now and then.A great cast that is strengthened by the smaller roles (Bernie Mac, Elliott Gould, Don Cheadle, et. al.), and the big names did not serve as distractions. Clooney oozes cool, Pitt was also great, as was Andy Garcia. Julia Roberts was the only big name who didn't seem immersed in her character, but whatever.In a word, this movie was slick. Great images, great interaction of characters, great fun!",Null,0,1,3 January 2002
The Insider," A good film, especially when seen through eyes of journalists
","I am a journalist, albeit in the print side of the industry, but seeing the inner workings on a heated issue such as Jeffrey Wigand's 'insider' interview was a lot of fun for me and my fiancee, who also worked at a newspaper before getting out into the world of technical writing (can't say I entirely blame her). But enough about that, let's look at the movie.Crowe and Plummer turn in top-notch performances, and Pacino, well, he's Pacino. A little overblown at times, but nothing to get annoyed with. He did a fine job as well. Plummer in particular amazed me with his job portraying Mike Wallace, a man who I hold incredible respect for. I wouldn't say this performance sullied the reputation of Mr. Wallace one bit.The movie drags a bit early, but as you get into the heart of the movie, you have developed characters. You don't question the motivation of the characters because you understand their processes. Some of the conversations could have probably been tightened/cut, but some are well worth the time (especially the fax-to-fax conversation between Pacino and Crowe).There are plenty of devices used to keep the movie from becoming too bogged down -- the intimidation factor of the big industry, in particular, is actually quite creepy -- and the movie is pleasant to look at, with nice work done by Mann and crew.The only downer was the theater I watched this movie at, as the seats sloped downward. Not the floor, the seats themselves. My fiancee and I both agreed to rent this movie when it hits the shelves to watch it again in comfort! Plus, it's good enough to see again.P.S.--The Pepsi girl (you know, the one who has those 'funny voices') is in this movie. Thankfully she is subdued. To top it off, the trailer for 'Bicentennial Man' played before the movie, also including said Pepsi girl. She's everywhere. Ugh.",Null,0,0,8 November 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Hard to judge this film, but what the heck...
","I've heard people say 'If 'Eyes Wide Shut' was done by anyone else, people would be disappointed.' In my case, that is why I'm disappointed. Because Kubrick was unable to maintain his extreme brilliance in what ended up being his final film. It was not a bad movie. Despite popular opinion, Tom Cruise's performance was fine in my eyes. Also, Nicole's limited opportunities didn't exactly scream 'Oscar!' (but what has in 1999?) The story was interesting to a point, but after 159 minutes, I had almost lost interest and noticed that many of the people in the theater had as well. Slightly over 2 hours would've been much better for the film's pace. The thoughts that ran through my mind:-- Haven't I seen this before? A different plot but the same idea done in a better way by Martin Scorsese in 'After Hours.' True, 'AH' might not be as profound, but that works to its advantage, anyway; EWS wasn't all that deep.-- Kidman pulled off the stoned act rather well. Either that, or everyone I've been in company with that was high acts the EXACT same way.-- After bragging to all my friends about how the almighty Kubrick had released another masterpiece, I realize I have a lot of phone calls to make once we get home.But it wasn't bad. I'm just venting my frustration. I will undoubtedly add this to my video collection and maybe even watch it once or twice. It just will not get the same workout that my Full Metal Jacket, 2001, and Clockwork tapes get.",7,0,0,2 September 1999
Vanilla Sky," Vanilla Sky = Adventurous swirl
","I've waited nearly a month to post my thoughts on this movie, so we'll see if I can pull this off in a coherent fashion ....I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, the latest offering from Cameron Crowe. Aside from using the music from his record collection, there aren't any similarities between this movie and his previous efforts. This is a sweeping story that blurs the lines of perception, and, I will admit, requires a little bit of patience from the viewer.David Aames (Cruise) wants it all, even after it is taken away. Getting it back leads to a blurring of lines that leaves him confused, even petrified. Once he realizes what it costs to have a second shot at what he wanted, a choice for regularity is presented. And for Mr. Aames, the guy who seems to lose the most when his face is destroyed, still has a hard time with the decision.The second half of the movie is very intriguing, although I found it quite confusing at one point. I will want to watch this a second time, but not until it comes out on DVD. I guess I didn't like it THAT much. What is real, what is not .... what is happening? Those were the questions I was asking myself. And for the most part, it made sense in the end. The resolution was spelled out in blunt fashion -- that is one complaint I had with the movie. Over explained; telling, not showing.The thing that worked for me is that the disjointed feel during the second half (or post-accident, if you will) reminded me of some of my own dreams, in theory. Things don't quite make sense, reality creeps in .... it captured the feel perfectly for me.The film does not depend on strong acting, and it doesn't get anything outstanding from Cruise or Cruz, although Cameron Diaz is a strong personality. The surreal elements are what did it for me. This is worth a viewing, but it could be done when it comes out for home viewing.",Null,0,0,3 January 2002
Any Given Sunday," Fumble! ('Spoilers' included, if that's possible)
","At first glance (the trailer), I drew a lot of similarities between this movie and The Program, with this appearing to be an upgrade: The Godfather replaces Sonny as the coach; the movie is longer, which must equal Oscar contender; and the hits are even bigger (and louder), enough to jar one from his or her seat.After seeing the movie, I realized it was just a longer, louder, duller version of the aforementioned Program. Maybe we weren't supposed to believe this movie was more relevant than the Omar Epps/James Caan vehicle, but with Oliver Stone, were we supposed to expect something less profound?I guess so. Good things: Pacino and Foxx. Pacino was solid and Foxx had an engaging personality and swagger that worked as the young star. And L.T., I should say I actually enjoyed his work. I found his steam room speech to Foxx quite ironic.Bad things: Cameron Diaz. It's not that I couldn't stand her character (that can be good) but I couldn't believe it. The cliches. Does it ALWAYS rain when the team the movie focuses on loses/gets creamed/etc./etc.? And wouldn't it have been a lot better had L.T. not gotten hurt in the risky playoff game? It sure would've been a lot more original. And do teams always win on the last play? It doesn't add to the drama, not one bit, after every single movie that involves a sporting event ends that way. Find another way, coach.The football logistics. A team that finishes the season 9-7 could've had home-field advantage if it had won its last game? 10-6 = home-field? A stretch ... And although this is a bit petty and licensing problems present themselves, I just can't get past the Miami Sharks, the Dallas Knights, et. al. And I also realize this wasn't the NFL ... it was the AFFL or whatever. So the new AFFL 'star' has a No. 3 rap single? Arena League signal callers across the domed nation will be penning lyrics like madmen, if that's the case.I could go on about time elements, the stereotypical alcoholism in the owners' boxes, Elizabeth Berkeley .... but I've probably went over the alloted number of words. I will close with this: If Stone wanted to catch the heart of football, he might have zoomed out and found a tripod to steady the damn camera. That would've moved the chains, at least (had to get one pun in).",5,0,0,29 December 1999
The Deer Hunter," Gripping
","One of my favorites, DeNiro and Walken turn in excellent performances as the friends-turned-soldiers whose relationship endures the worst of times. I agree that the running time could have been reduced (slightly), but the length of the movie doesn't tarnish its overall worth. I enjoyed the characters, the story and the images. Something I will show my nearest and dearest.",Null,0,0,21 November 2000
