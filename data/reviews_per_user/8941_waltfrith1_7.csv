Lucky Number Slevin," Hard twists.
","Not too hard or easy to follow, this picture, with enough twists and turns to fill a couple of dozen movies, will have you guessing some of the twists correctly before it's over, but it will still fool you part of the way until the last scene. With a total 'A' list of who's who, 'Lucky Number Slevin' is not only a great story of revenge but who exactly is gaining revenge in the story is the real payoff. Josh Hartnett is more than adequate alongside heavyweights like Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman and with the ever likable Bruce Willis in tow, this is a movie that looks more than entertaining, it looks like a chess game with the best of players. For those only with an IQ of 100 or more. You've been warned!",Null,0,1,24 February 2007
United 93," The day that will live in eternity.
","September 11, 2001. If December 7, 1941 was declared to be a day that would live in infamy, then 9/11 will be a day that will live in eternity. The worst terrorist attack to date on American soil and an event that changed the lives of more than 5 billion people on the planet. Director Paul Greengrass presents a heart stopping re-creation of the events of that day and the film is so well edited that it feels like 9/11 is happening all over again and that the viewer is in the film experiencing every bone chilling moment. As historical fact, it is authentic, as a bona fide classic, it is indisputable and as a tribute to those who died that day, it is more than fitting.",Null,0,1,24 February 2007
Children of Men," Bizarrely convincing vision.
","The year is 2027. Since 2009 the human race has no longer been able to procreate. A former activist (Clive Owen) meets up with an old flame (Julianne Moore) and involves himself in the activities of an underground movement that seeks to protect the first pregnant woman in 18 years to appear on the planet. This a bizarrely convincing tale that may be science fiction but in today's world of ever growing dangers and the threat of a possible all out global war unlike any other brewing, 'Children of Men' seems like it could not only happen but the fascism, terrorism, idealism and conflict contained within its frames makes for some of the most visionary work of the year.",Null,1,5,24 February 2007
Blood Diamond," Cruelty free message.
","What happens when an innocent African fisherman (Djimon Hounsou), forced to work as a slave and whose family has been taken from him by war lords, finds a priceless pink diamond and buries it. In a word, WAR! Leonardo DiCaprio is a former soldier turned mercenary who, with his own African blood makes a deal to help find the fisherman's family in exchange for a share of the diamond's value. With an American journalist helping his cause and all kinds of war lords, private armies and thugs in pursuit, 'Blood Diamond' has a cruelty free message about what is harvested from the earth and the responsibility people have for making humane choices. Explosive action, greed, compassion, determination and very adult entertainment all have a place in this blistering movie that you can't take your eyes off.",Null,0,0,24 February 2007
The Departed," Crime central.
","The best film of 2006, in the tradition of 'Mean Streets', 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull' and 'GoodFellas', is a film that is right up there with the best work that director Martin Scorsese has ever done and this is the best written film of those previously mentioned. This cat and mouse story of of a crooked mole (Matt Damon) inside the Boston state police force and an undercover police officer (Leonardo DiCaprio) inside Boston's Irish mob is a convincing and evenly paced thriller with enough high points leading up to its conclusion that would make Mount Everest jealous. Mark Wahlberg, as a foul mouthed and self righteous staff sergeant on the force steals every scene he is in and Jack Nicholson's sinister portrayal of the film's mob boss is as lethal as any crime boss we've ever seen, only Jack is smoother than all the rest. With support from others such as Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, 'The Departed' captures the appeal of the obligatory violence that Scorsese is known for in his films and this is an instant classic that is not only one of Scorsese's best but it is arguably one of the best crime films ever made.",Null,1,2,24 February 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," The metaphor for the definition of destiny?
","Will Ferrell's career took a turn for the better with this engaging little fantasy film about a very ordinary man with an exact daily regiment who suddenly hears a voice describing his every action as if were being documented by someone. He finds out that his life is the work of a writer (Emma Thompson) and that his final destiny lies within the conclusion of her book until he can figure out a way to stop it. With a superb supporting cast that includes Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Queen Latifah, 'Stranger than Fiction' is part fantasy, part love story, part detective story and an absorbing metaphor that keeps the debate alive about whether or not people are actually in control of their own lives or whether they are victims of destiny.",Null,1,2,24 February 2007
The Queen," Royal protocol (and the lack of it).
","This film should appeal equally to those who support the British monarchy or to those who oppose it. Helen Mirren is Queen Elizabeth II and some say that her cold and often rigid personality is misunderstood and this film, like a fly on the wall observing the life of Britain's royal family and the government it tangles with over the public relations disaster that ensued in the wake of the death of Princess Diana in 1997, is rich in its regal presentation of protocol (and the lack of it) and runs just the right length which keeps it from boring the audience not used to such refined qualities in film. A triumph in showing the human side of people often perceived as 'out of touch' with today's public.",Null,0,1,24 February 2007
