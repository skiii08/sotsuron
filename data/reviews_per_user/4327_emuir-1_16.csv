Black Swan," Echos of Polanski's Repulsion
","In the mid 60's I saw Roman Polanski's memorable film Repulsion, starring Catherine Deneuve as a sexually repressed Belgian girl living with her worldly sister in London, who slowly went mad as she suffered sexual fantasies. Black Swan has the same theme, but the action takes place in the hothouse atmosphere of a ballet company. We have seen it all before, and better, in The Red Shoes and Turning Point: the rigorous training for a brief career - dancers are washed up by their mid 30's, the bleeding feet, the injuries, the bullying artistic directors who demand total subjection to their art.If watching ballet is your thing, Black Swan is a disappointment as it mostly takes place in the rehearsal rooms. If thrillers are more to your taste, I can think of many far better. Overall, despite some very good performances, particularly Vincent Cassell, Barbara Hershey, and Mila Kunis, I found the film boring.",Null,0,1,6 August 2011
Walk the Line," Surprisingly dreary
","I say surprisingly, as I had expected a film about music legend Johnny Cash to be an exciting recreation of the birth of rock and roll era, and later his dominance in country music. Instead we got an overlong film about an alcohol and drug dependent Cash deserting his wife and family to chase after another man's wife. Well, I guess that is the stuff country music is filled with - his dog didn't die, but his tractor got stuck in the mud, and he was broke and drunk half the time. So the stars did all their own singing - a pity - neither of them can stay in tune. It just made me want to play a recording of the real Johnny Cash to drown them out.",5,1,6,20 January 2007
The 13th Warrior," This movie ranks, and I mean RANKS, at the bottom
","How could a film which supposedly cost $100 million and has a similar theme to Game of Thrones, be so totally boring and just awful to sit through. Even my cat was pawing at the door to be let out. If Ed Wood had been listed as producer/director/writer I would have known what to expect. To begin with, the special effects seemed more like a low budget TV movie, and the film looked as if it had been shot with a home video camera or 16 mm film. Where did the money go? Antonio Banderas cannot act, he just stands around while we get shots of his big brown eyes, but at least they did not try to pass him off as a Viking Warrior, for which I will give the film a rating of 1. Even Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis did a better job as Vikings, although they were Jewish. THIS-TV showed a low budget film this week called Royal Deceit, (Prince of Jutland) a telling of the Viking saga on which Shakespeare's Hamlet was based, and which showed how absorbing a budget film could be. The footage should be given to film students to practice with and see if someone can come up with an understandable, interesting, and more enjoyable film.",1,1,11,1 December 2012
Troy," Battles, sword fights, and more.
","A film always reflects the attitudes of the period in which it was made, and in which it is viewed.  Troy is no exception.  Whether or not the Trojan war really happened does not matter: given man's  need for  periodic bloodletting it is more than likely.  One cannot help but draw parallels and comparisons with the current times - a war fought on a flimsy pretext to cover the real reason - extending power and a show of force.  Agamemnon, having consolidated the Greek states into a coalition with himself as King, is determined to grab rich Troy and show them who is the boss.  It is more interesting to watch a tale of times when Kings were warriors who had to fight for their kingdoms and lead their armies into battle, rather than the war being fought from comfortable offices thousands of miles away by men who have never seen action.  The saber rattling is the same.  
The story is taken from Homer's epic poem of the Greek armada sailing across the Aegean Sea to attack the city state of Troy, on the pretext of avenging the abduction of Helen, Queen of Sparta by the young Prince Paris of Troy. At the end of a long 10-year siege, the Greeks gained entry into Troy by means of the wooden horse and sacked the City.  In the film version, the siege lasts about 2 weeks.  Combatants agree to call it a day and go home at sundown, Achilles is a conceited  bisexual thug, Paris needs to be sent off to his room (after a cold shower), and Agamemnon needs to take Pepto Bismol.  Helen, the older woman, tries the 'my husband doesn't understand me' on young Paris, who falls for it with disastrous consequences, he certainly wasn't thinking with his head, and decent doomed  Hector gets stuck with the damage control.   They don't call it Greek tragedy for nothing!The film is an enjoyable way to spend a hot afternoon in an air-conditioned cinema.  There are lots of sword fights and combat scenes .  The films has a very nice `look'.  Interiors are dark and candlelit, exteriors are lit with the brilliant light of the Mediterranean.   The colors are lovely, especially the use of the various blue/green shades of the sea in clothes and jewelry.    Why they had to depict Troy as being in a sandy desert was puzzling, as the excavations of Troy show it to be located in a green and pleasant pastureland.Accepting the fact that the 10-year siege had to be was compressed into 2 1/2 hours, my only problem was with  the some of the casting.   Ms. Kruger, as Helen of Troy was totally wooden; notwithstanding that  she wasnt given much to do, any one of a thousand actresses could have made something out of the role.  They could have substituted a mannequin for free.   Eric Bama who was outstanding as the noble Hector, would have been more interesting had the roles of Achilles and Hector been switched, with Eric Bama playing Achilles.  I feel that it is a mistake to combine venerable British actors with American `film stars' as the two have different and not always compatible acting styles.   This was obvious in the scene where Peter O'Toole, playing the old King Priam, comes to the tent of Achilles to plead for the return of Hector's body after it has been dragged to the Greek camp behind Achilles chariot.  Brad Pitt handled the scene very well, but was completely upstaged by Peter O'Tooles more theatrical style.   Troy is an epic film which demands the more grandiose theatrical style of the British actors, as was very evident in Brian Cox's stealing every scene as Agamemnon.",8,4,8,17 May 2004
The Lost City of Z," Very disappointing
","As an avid viewer and collector of every film and book about exploration in South America and Africa, I could not wait to see this film. Living in rural America I had to wait for the download or DVD, but oh, was I ever disappointed! Rather than the multiple viewings of Augirre, Fitzcarraldo, the Mission, King Solomon's Mines, Rhodes, even Raiders of the Lost Ark and hokey old Republic movies, this film completely missed the mark. For one thing it was murky and dark. I checked the box to see if it was SD or Standard as the resolution was so poor. Where we should have had brilliantly clear images of the mountains and jungle, we got a few seconds, then back to the gloom. A lot of time seemed to be spent floating upriver on rafts. The book by David Grann, on which the film was based, was a journalist's account of the life and subsequent disappearance of Col. Percy Fawcett who made seven expeditions to Amazon region, not three. Mr. Grann did not have much to work with, so like a good journalist, he hyped up what he had and speculated on the rest. Fawcett was an army officer who after serving 20 undistinguished years in Ceylon and faced with a lack of advancement, took a surveying course and was sent to impartially survey the borders of Peru and Bolivia on behalf of Britain to avoid hostilities. He made several trips, and after a break for WWI, in which he did not serve on the front line as shown in the film, being too old, he became obsessed with the idea of a lost city, which along with the discovery, would help British prestige by placing another jewel in the crown. At the time, British explorers had been planting the flag in Africa and spreading the good word throughout the savage world. Fawcett may also have been driven by a desire to get there before the Americans, as Hiram Bingham's discovery of Machu Picchu had captivated the world's imagination. Captain Scott, whose ill fated expedition to the South Pole, where he was beaten by a Norwegian by 10 days and perished on the return journey, was regarded by an outraged Britain as a hero cheated of his rightful victory by that cad Amundssen's use of dogs! Make no mistake, the British firmly believed in the superiority of the British Empire, and that all future discoveries belonged to British gentleman by right, not Americans and foreigners! WWI was to shake that belief and any heroic exploits which could be seized on to beat the drum and restore the faith was seized upon. The film conveys little of this. Where I expected longer sequences showing the hardships and near starvation and deaths endured by the explorers, we got three brief expeditions which might just as well have been a boy scouts weekend camping trip. One expedition failed after 10 days starvation, of which a photograph still exists of the emaciated survivors. Where were the clouds of biting insects which made sleep impossible, dangerous snakes dropping from trees, the 62 foot long Anaconda which was killed, waterlogged boots rotting from the damp? The journey to reach the expedition sites took months, usually overland from Buenos Aries, but the film gave the impression it was two days by air. One minute they are in the jungle, a few seconds later the ocean liner is being welcomed by cheering crowds in Britian. Fawcett may not have been the heroic expert explorer that was portrayed by the press of the time, desperately searching for heroes and in the process glorifying some flawed men. In leaving his wife to raise their children alone he was really no different from Captain Scott and serving army officers posted to India and the far east and naval officers who left their families for years on end. He was a man of his time doing what was generally accepted. Had he not disappeared during a highly publicized expedition, he may very well have been forgotten. The one thing he was right about was the belief that there had previously been an advanced civilization in the Amazon. We now know from recent discovery and satellite images that there had indeed been an advanced culture which supported thousands of people, and that the remains have been swallowed by the jungle regrowth, and the descendants of a people and culture destroyed by the European discovery have fallen into a dark ages. Whether his belief in and attempts to discover a lost city were entirely scholarly, or motivated by fame and the possible discovery of gold, we don't know and probably never will.To be fair and to give the film another chance, I will watch it again to see if my boredom (I switched off three times and went to do something else, including the washing and ironing) was just that I was not in the mood. Sometimes my opinion has changed on a second viewing.",3,11,19,20 August 2017
The Commitments," One of the best
","The most surprising thing about this gem is that the cast have not gone on to film careers. Many of them can hold their own with the overpaid prima donnas we are subjected to ad nauseum in the celebrity magazines and TV shows. Perhaps this film is proof that acting talent is not really necessary in films, it all lies with the director and the film editor! Nevertheless, this film is just hilarious, and can be seen over and over as each viewing reveals something not noticed before. The cast of unknowns is so good that it is hard to pick the best. The most memorable to me was Joe Fagan, who may or may not have been telling the truth about his 'career'. Whether or not he was, he was spinning the line that everyone wanted to hear. There are so many brilliant cameos in this film that it is hard to single out anyone in particular, or the visual touches, such as the picture of the Pope on the wall of the Rabitte household, with Elvis' picture above. I loved also the depiction of the street markets and the clubs. I have this film on VHS and often show it to friends, but now I want the DVD with the 'extras'. Now if only the DVD's also came with a copy of the book from which the film was made, that would be something!",Null,2,4,14 May 2005
Legends of the Fall," Emily Bronte did it better
","In the 1840's Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights, which was considered so shocking that she had to write under a non de plume, Ellis Bell. The story told of the passionate burning love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliffe, the wild child found in Liverpool by Catherine Earnshaw's father, which destroyed everyone around them and lasted beyond the grave. The book has been translated into every language on the globe and has never been out of print.Legends of the Fall is a Wuthering Heights kind of family tragedy as the fiancé of one of the brothers (the wild one) falls deeply in love with him, but is rejected by him when he decides to go off alone to 'find himself'. He returns later to find she has married his straight laced elder brother, but she is still besotted with him. Ah, the grand passion! Brad Pitt plays the same type he played in 'A River Runs Though It' the wild child, and Aidan Quinn the same role he played in 'The Mission', the decent straight arrow brother who falls in love with the fiancé left behind for years by his wild seafaring brother. Have these casting directors no imagination? I enjoyed the film as you would a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie, but would not rate it a great epic or Oscar worthy. Many viewers rhapsodized over the scenery. What Scenery? All I saw was a green meadow with the shape of blue mountains in the background.I bought the DVD many years ago and watched it again last night. The overall feeling was that of over pretentious Harlequin Romance.",7,1,2,14 May 2017
The Hurt Locker," Why so many 1 out of 10 votes?
","So many people gave this one star, and just as many or more gave it 10; therefore, it is very polarising. Those who only gave it one star are either members of a fan club of someone who did not get an academy award, or their prefer their war movies fast action,with the hero running up a ramp behind a tank to appear that he cleared the tank in one jump, assault weapon blazing away in all directions, and being American of course, he wins the battle. The action fans just didin't get it. This was not a full on gung ho action movie, but a suspenseful account of the daily grind of bomb disposal, where the men know that any second could be their last, and after a tense morning disarming an explosive, they have to go out and do it again. The people whose streets are being made safe hate their guts and don't want them there, and you get the feeling that many of the watchers just want to see the Yanks get blown up. I did keep asking myself why were the Americans there anyway - it's not their war. There were many criticisms, too many to tackle every one, but I will address a few. One was that the insurgents would not kidnap a business man and use him as a suicide bomber. Wrong! They do this and also with children. It is also used to extort money. Another gripe was that the bomb disposal unit would not have had a sniper with them. I disagree. As the several of the men were providing back up coverage, they would have been trained to shoot accurately as well as blasting away with all they had got. Another poster claimed that no Iraqi would be able to shoot so accurately from a distance. Perhaps that kind of thinking is what gets people killed! Never, never assume the enemy is inferior. Those who felt the new war junkie unit leader would have been disciplined or even thrown out of the unit may be right. In a perfect world he would, but in a world where results are all that matter, his callous recklessness would be seen as bravery. Whether or not there were inaccuracies doesn't really bother me. It is fiction. Even real life events are gussied up to sell papers. How many man shot down the Red Baron? How many Navy Seals killed Osama bin Laden alone? There is hardly a film based on a true story which did not take liberty with the facts in order to make it more interesting. As long as the film conveys what it is trying to do, I am happy with it, and The Hurt Locker was a different kind of film which kept me glued to the screen for two hours. I took one star off because of the irritating boy selling fake DVD's. There always seems to be one hanging around in war movies. I was not sorry to see the back of him.",9,1,2,20 February 2018
Jerry Maguire," A wonderful fun comedy spoiled by coarse language
","This film had the same light, funny, feelgood texture of Moonlighting, but the brilliantly funny script was ruined by one thing - the kind of coarse language which used to be described as 'barrack room language' or 'Anglo Saxon four letter words'. Unfortunately the dialogue of modern films is increasingly filled with language that would have been totally unacceptable anywhere but in a men only bar or the locker room.At the risk of sounding like someone's maiden aunt, I find this language unnecessary and offensive - especially when it is coming out of the mouths of children. It used to be said that the use of bad language was a sign of a lazy mind, yet we are seeing and hearing it daily.With the advent of DVD's we should to be able to select a version with the coarse vulgarity eradicated.",5,2,11,19 December 2004
Blood Diamond," Why does it take so long to recognize atrocities?
","We have another film recognizing the atrocities committed in the African continent during the dark ages of violence and war which has followed the collapse of colonial rule. The massacres, ethnic cleansing and general upheaval, not to mention the general breakdown of law and order which have taken place in Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, the Congo Republic, Rhodesia and Dafur, just to name a few, are only now becoming exposed via the medium of film. This film is a must see along with Hotel Rwanda and The Last King of Scotland.The savage conflict in Sierra Leone, once part of Britain's West African colonial empire, with its forcible recruitment of child soldiers and killing and maiming of tens of thousands by lawless gangs of self appointed rebels and freedom fighters was reported at the time, but largely ignored by the rest of the world until several years had passed and it was safe to make a film about it. As they said in the film, TIA - this is Africa! Wrong - this is the chaos that follows when a superpower's imposed rule ends leaving behind a power vacuum. The most interesting parallel in the film was that of the child soldier Dia, and Danny Archer, himself a child soldier, albeit a white one. Danny's parents had been murdered in the struggle in Zimbabwe, after white colonial rule had ended with a unilateral declaration of independence. Danny joined the army in South Africa and served in Angola, where he became a trained killer under the guidance of Colonel Coetze, just as Dia comes under the guidance of Colonel Poison. Neither Coetze nor Poison care about their young proteges, except for tuning them into emotionless killing machines. Coetze is now involved in diamond smuggling, and Danny is one of his field contacts.Danny courts Solomon, who discovered and concealed a valuable diamond, because he wants to find and make money from the diamond. Solomon's search for his son is an distraction that he does not have time for. He meets the reporter, Maddy, and his reaction is that of a droplet of water in a hot frying pan, but eventually his eyes are opened and he comes to see how they are all being used by the diamond cartel, who do not even sell the diamonds which have destroyed so many lives, but lock them away in a vault to manipulate the price. The film also makes the point that we all contribute to the violence and slave labor when we buy the product.The ending of the film offers hope for Solomon and Dia, but none for Danny who has not known anything but war and probably could never settle down to a quiet life.",9,2,2,7 September 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Should have been called 'Buckets of Blood!'
","Watching this film at 3 a.m. on a sleepless night I was amused by the messages at commercial breaks warning that this movie may not be suitable for younger viewers.  What kind of children are up at 3 a.m.? Whatever, I could not take my eyes off this riveting and at times hilariously funny film.  the restaurant scene at the beginning ranks with the famous greasy spoon scene in 'Five Easy Pieces'.  The realistic dialog crackles and has you laughing out loud. Goodfellas meet the Sopranos.  My only complaint was the gore, buckets of it.  The warehouse was like a slaughterhouse. Other than that, the cast was superb - not a misstep among them.",Null,1,3,30 May 2004
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Vera Day
","I want to know how Vera Day, the sexy blond of British films in the 1950's, who had not made a film since 1964, came to do such a wonderful cameo in this film. The moment she came on the screen, she was the epitome of the attractive, aging, hardboiled sports/pub owner, the kind where they stage boxing matches, and the kind of woman who knows how to keep her mouth shut.There was a pub on Eel Pie Island, in the east Thames - London's dockland, which was run by a woman who staged boxing matches in the pub. Tanya reminded me of her and brought back many, many memories.I loved the film, but Vera Day, as Tanya, is the character I remember most.",9,4,6,25 February 2008
The Good Shepherd," Riveting but ultimately confusing
","I literally sat on the edge of my seat watching this film, and it's oft criticised length did not bother me at all, in fact I would have preferred it to be longer in order to tie up some of the loose ends which were not made clear.First, the good parts. The supporting cast, other than noted, was superb. Michael Gambon especially who seemed to have stepped right out of Cambridge Spies. Was he or wasn't he a double agent? There is always a question hanging over the people involved in this line of work. Wilson's Russian counterpart, Ulysses, was the other side of the same coin. The film did show very well that intelligence agents are interchangeable between their countries, especially if they lose faith in their government. The film indirectly questioned whether it was the right choice to recruit agents from the upper class elite, just as Britain did and later found to its cost that privileged backgrounds are no guarantee of loyalty. The lack of fisticuffs, car chases, and James Bond style circus tricks was a relief. Intellience gathering is deadly monotony with a lot of watching and waiting. My main problem, other than that I found the storyline somewhat confusing, was the casting of Angeline Jolie as the long suffering wife. First of all, Ms. Jolie is one of those actors who are so well known and larger than life, via the gossip columns, that they cannot submerge themselves into the character. While the rest of the players become their characters, the Angeline Jolies of Hollywood remain themselves and consequently strike a wrong note. the viewer is watching Angelina Jolie, not Clover. In addition, her character, Clover, began as a sexually aggressive man hunter from an upper class WASP background, then turned into a neglected wife patiently waiting for her husband to come home from the war, and post war, and beyond. Ms. Jolie did not convince me that she would put up with that. I was waiting throughout the film for her to dump Wilson. He was away for six years! Was there never any leave? The switching from period to period was also a little confusing, but much less forgivable was not clearing up the loose ends, or was the fate of the son and his fiancé meant to be ambiguous? We know what happened to her, but who did it? Why did they take the Russian defector at face value and not ask him to play the violin when he first was briefed, why did they wait until much later? The DVD showed deleted scenes, and in one of them they asked the defector to play the violin in what may have been an earlier scene, but unfortunately there was no commentary supplied revealing why the scenes had been deleted, especially the fate of Clover's brother John, whose troubling fate was just written off. This was a thoroughly engrossing film, but I could have used a director's commentary on the DVD.",7,1,2,7 October 2007
La Vie En Rose," They left out more than they put in
","Apart from the fact that I found this the most depressing film since 'The Serpent's Egg', my biggest disappointments were with the lack of subtitling for the songs, and that large periods of Edith Piaf's life were just left out - WWII never happened! During WWII, France was occupied by the Germans, and just as in Iraq today, the occupying forces thought they, and the citizens who worked with them, were the good guys. The film 'Le Chagrin et la Pitie' showed that many French citizens either willingly, or by indifference, collaborated with the Germans. Like many other prominent Frenchmen and women, Edith Piaf's actions during the war years were ambiguous to say the least. She was accused of collaborating, and she did sing for the Germans in their clubs. After the war, just as the majority of Germans claimed to have been anti-Nazi, the population claiming to have been members of the French Resistance grew to a point where you wonder how France ever fell to the Germans, and how they managed to deport so many French Jews. Edith Piaf claimed to have been secretly working for the Resistance, but this has not been verified. Whether or not she was a collaborator or a Resistance member should have been addressed in the film. Instead the narrative took a giant leap forward from 1940 to 1947.The other fault was that the subtitling did not include a translation of her songs. As Piaf died over 40 years ago, she is not known to many people under the age of 60, and even they don't all speak French. If you are going to have subtitles for the dialogue, there should also be a translation of the songs, which were very much a part of her story, especially the final ending where she sang 'je ne regrette rien' - I have no regrets! This was akin to making a foreign language film about Vera Lynn, without letting the audience know the words of her immortal inspiring songs of WWII.",5,9,13,20 January 2008
Gangs of New York," Sordid unrelenting blood bath
","What can be said of a film where the best scenes were the few seconds at the end, where the New York skyline morphed from the slums of Five Points to the skyline pre September 11, 2001. This film may appeal to those who want to see a violent blood bath set in grimy surroundings and played out by Hogarthian degenerates, but it is not in any way entertainment.  I kept waiting for Dante's Inferno to open up and swallow them into the fiery furnace.  The films plods unrelentingly through human misery and violence for more than two and a half hours.  Never once did I get the feeling that it may not be pleasant to watch, but at least it was raising my consciousness.  This was just a film of violence, blood lust and misery, as repulsive as Kurasawa's 'The Lower Depths'. 
I felt as if the director was making a film about depravity for the sake of depravity.  As if there should be a voiceover stating that 'In the Casbah/slums of Shanghai/Limehouse/Paris/Bombay every vice is catered to. Murder, drugs, vice, white slavery. No one asks questions, no one knows your name, you can hide or disappear, or make someone disappear.'  The opening voiceover from all those black and white films noire - Algiers, Shanghai Gesture, etc.  This is debauchery from the comfort of your cinema seat. 
Daniel Day-Lewis's ludicrous leering mustachioed Victorian melodrama villain robbed the film of any credibility and belonged to vaudeville. Far and away the only performance worth watching was Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed.  The overrated and unappealing Cameron Diaz and Leonardo diCaprio deserved each other.    I can now understand why comedies and musicals did so well during the depression.  Some of us go to the cinema to be uplifted and entertained. There is beauty in the world if you want to look for it.",1,41,77,22 December 2002
Atonement," As dull and pretentious as 'The English Patient'
","Beautiful scenes of the English countryside and the stately homes of the rich do not save this from being the kind of romantic fiction which used to be swallowed up by 14 -year-old girls. At least 'The English Patient' had handsome Naveen Andrews to gaze at. And why is it that the blue eyes of children frequently turn brown when they grow up. With all the actors available one would think that they could find a pair with the same color eyes, or avoid close ups.The Dunkirk scenes were interesting, even if militarily inaccurate. If the evacuation had been as depicted, it is no wonder the BEF was in retreat. They would have needed to go home and learn military tactics. As for the black soldier, where did he come from? For me the best scenes were in the hospital with Gina McKee as Sister Drummond, the true martinet of the times, running the hospital like a boot camp, but why did she not set the nursing trainees straight about floppy hair falling out of caps? At that time hair had to be firmly held in place and not a stray hair loose. The scenes of nurses mopping floors and being used as skivvies was certainly correct.Overall, I found the sloppy continuity and cutting back and forth confusing, in addition to which they seem to have got the dates wrong. A little reference to the history books would not have hurt. I especially cringed when someone referred to a character being evacuated TO Dunkirk! And I had always thought it was FROM Dunkirk - well, well!",3,4,9,9 June 2008
