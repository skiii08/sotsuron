Who Framed Roger Rabbit," All your childhood fantasies in one movie!!
","This movie is almost as old as I am, therefore I saw it at a very early age. As a big animation lover (from Bambi to Family Guy), this is still one of my favorite movies to date.The first time I saw it, I looked at it from a different perspective, obviously. For me it was the detective and Toons, taking the fight to Judge Doom and his weasels. Hooray for the good guys.A good 15 years later, I found the special edition on DVD and bought it instantly. Viewing movies from a completely different perspective, this movie is still the instant classic I remembered as a 6 year old. Great acting by Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd + a combination of animation and real life that Space Jam could only dream of. Don't get me wrong, Space Jam is great as well. The action sequences with Benny the cab and in the Acme factory are still legendary. The story and dialogue are great as well.Long story short: a great comedy/action-film for all ages. For the very worried parents, the final scene between Detective Valiant and Judge Doom can be a bit intense for younger children.",10,2,2,1 February 2014
The Intouchables," An absolute honor to own this masterpiece!!
","It's a shame I can only rate this movie ten out of ten. This has to be my number 1 movie of the last 10 years.I have to admit, the first time watching it, was kind of lame (nonstop service KLM from Amsterdam to Calgary). I usually don't have the patience for a movie at 30000 feet, flights make me restless. However, this movie did it. I watched it without noticing the stewardess who was inquiring my lunch pick. It's a good thing you can pause movies on board nowadays. Back home, I bought the special edition (Blu-ray, DVD, book, soundtrack, poster, production notes, etc.) and watched it again. I don't know if it was the difference in altitude, seat and screen; wow, what a great movie. The kind of movie that gets better and better. I must have seen it 7 times by now.The chemistry between Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy is fantastic. In a world where people are getting more greedy, biased and impatient, these 2 people manage to bring out the best in each other, despite the different worlds they live in. The scene where Driss shaves Philippe for his date is absolutely hilarious, along with the scene where they give Philippes wheelchair a little 'boost'. Well, actually, there aren't any scenes in this movie NOT worth watching. Hands down the best 'dramedy' I've ever seen.A worthy movie for everyone. Women, men and children alike.",10,0,0,1 February 2014
Quantum of Solace," It's good to make changes, but this.....
","As an avid James Bond fan, I went to this movie yesterday with big expectations. I came out of the theater pretty disappointed. The trailer looked so promising but the movie wasn't able to impress me. First reason: The story is LAME!!! Some freaky French guy who wants to take control of the water supply. Sounds like a typical Jean Claude Van Damme story. Second reason: The Title Song is terrible.Third reason: To many (weird) locations. Your mind is still at Austria, and Bond is already off to Bolivia via Italy. And speaking of Bolivia, A hotel in the middle of the desert as a location for the climax of the movie? Come on Mr. Forster, you can do better than that!!!Fourth reason: Where is the Bond vibe? No Martini's, no famous introduction 'The name's Bond, James Bond', no gadgets and not a lot of joking around. Well, I can write 1 more page about how disappointing this movie is, but every movie has good parts in it. This one is no exception. - The action sequences are pretty good, The beginning of the movie has some wonderful action in it including a small twist in the story. - Also very nice eye candy. Olga Kurylenko was hot in Hit-man, in this movie she keeps it up. She is also good in playing mysterious characters. Gemma Arterton looks pretty cute in this movie too, too bad she doesn't have a really big role in the movie. - Judi Dench: This woman plays an excellent M. It was (and is) a shame that characters such as Q and Moneypenny didn't return in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, but luckily M is still in the movies. - Daniel Craig. No matter what people think of him, the new James Bond is excellent. Daniel matches up perfectly with Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan. Story: -- Good Guy Characters: + Bad Guy Characters: - Bond Babes: ++ Locations: +- Cars (always important in JB movies): + Action sequences: + Title Song: -- Humor: -Overall: 6.5 out of 10",6,4,6,17 November 2008
Non-Stop," Non-Stop AWESOME!!!
","I've always been a big fan of Liam Neesson. After the first Taken came out, he became the kind of actor I would even almost cheer for. His action roles are very enjoyable. He has a kind of anti hero flair, but at the same time he'll go all Steven Seagal on the bad guys.So much for the man in charge, this movie is another fine example of how I see Liam in character. His role as air marshal is comparable with his role in Taken. He has been through a lot in his life and he's trying to live through it all, whilst being forced to repel enemies.The way this movie has been put together, one word: brilliant!!! The way they introduce characters on board of the flight is excellent. You keep guessing who the unseen terrorist(s) are. Your choices for this flight (no pun intended) are a Muslim doctor, a racist NYPD officer, the arrogant businessman, the annoying German, the paranoid Julliane Moore who sits next to Liam on board, the crew, etc. Everyone on board could have a potential motive to do what the bad guy(s) do on board of this flight. The way they let you keep guessing is just great. To back up the element of 'who's doing it', the movie is filled with great action sequences and enough tense moments. The fight in the lavatory is brilliant, Jason Bourne would probably have trouble doing this one, kudos for executing this sequence in a brilliant way. Not to spoil anymore about this great thriller, just watch it. Great setting, great action, enough suspense en good characters. This is probably the best airplane thriller I've ever seen.",9,1,5,1 March 2014
Django Unchained," Quentin Tarantino is a genius!!
","When Inglourious Basterds came out, I didn't think it would be possible for Tarantino to make an even better film. But he did it!!!Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz steal the show. They say it's never a good idea to give the lead roles to two Academy Award winners, Django Unchained proves that theory wrong. Both actors are the ammo and this movie is a double barreled shotgun. It blows you away. The chemistry between Waltz and Foxx is great, they create the perfect, awkward duo. They know it and so does every other character in the movie. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Samuell L. Jackson plays the perfect 'bad guy'. If you thought his character was annoying and creepy in Lakeview Terrace, then you will love him in this movie. Leonardo Di Caprio has proved himself in a lot of artistic roles in the past, in this one he gets to be in touch with his psycho side. The dinner at his plantation in the movie is fine example of that. I read somewhere in an interview with Tarantino that the blood you see in that scene belongs to Di Caprio, but that he was so into his role that Tarantino kept filming. I applaud the result!! Kerry Washington plays a frightened but sweet wife to Django. Dr. King Schultz's response when husband and wife see each other again after a long period of separation is brilliant. The dialog: superb, the acting: superb, the cast: excellent. Overall: a big fat A+. Definitely one of my favorite movies of the last few years.",10,0,3,6 August 2013
Up," Two thumbs way UP!!!!
","I don't know where to start with this movie. I guess I'll just say that it is totally awesome!!! Finding Nemo was my Pixar favorite, but I think this one might be just a whole lot better!! Fun story, great animation, great characters (Duggie & Kevin) and best of all: a touch of emotion. This movie is a breakthrough. Adults were usually able to enjoy Pixar movies, this one really shows that it's trying to connect with adult audience.Very very enjoyable. This one is going to win the academy award for best animated movie next year, for sure!!! Keep UP the good work Pixar :)",10,0,1,14 December 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," The best animated movie I have ever seen!!
","It's been a since that I have seen this movie, so the other day I popped in the blu ray. Man oh man, what a movie. It reminded me again what my favorite animated movie is. First of all, the voice cast is great. Gerard Butler steals the show as Stoick the Vast. Jay Baruchels voice really creates the social outcast appearance that his character Hiccup has in the movie.Second: The animation. I doesn't get much better. The iris of Toothless eye is a perfect example, so much detail. These 2 facts get backed up by a lot of humor, a good story, a great score, romance and best of all, a lot of excitement. This movie should have been the winner for the Academy Award for best animated feature, not Toy Story 3...The Lion King used to be my favorite animated movie, move over Simba, here's Toothless!!!",10,0,0,5 August 2013
Jaws," The biggest mistake was watching it when I was 6!!!!
","This movie is without a doubt the best Shark movie ever. I'd say it's even the best monster movie ever. Being born 13 years after it came out, I wasn't aware of the amazing impact the movie had in the seventies. But after seeing it, I can imagine what the impact was. I remember watching it when I was 8. BIG MISTAKE!!! I was probably thinking it was some monster from a Disney movie or something. That movie scared the living ***p out of me. I'll admit that I still can't swim in water were you can't see the bottom. The price I had to pay for watching it as a kid. Oh well, I wasn't a avid fan of the ocean anyways.But I bought the movie some years ago and as a teen I enjoyed it thoroughly. Fantastic thrilling music, great actors, great setting and off course a great director. Deep Blue Sea is an okay movie, but if you want to see a good shark movie, watch Jaws, don't think, just watch Jaws. Trash such as Shark Attack, Megalodon and all that other junk is absolutely a waste of time. And to join the discussion about sequels, Jaws 2 is okay, but don't watch the rest, it's kind of silly. Anyway, this movie...WOW!!!9 out of 10",9,2,5,17 November 2008
Defiance," Excellent!!! Better then Excellent!!!
","As an intern from the Netherlands, I'm taking full advantage of the fact that movies are out sooner here then in the Netherlands. I've seen a lot of movies so far, this one being the last one I saw. And I must say, It was Excellent. People were clapping at the end, I'd say it's no more then logic. Edward Zwick definitely left his calling card with this one. Well I guess he already did with Blood Diamond and the Last Samurai.The movie is about 3 Jewish brothers that flee into the Belorussian woods after their father and others in their village get brutally executed by the Nazi's. In the woods, they meet other Jews fleeing from the Nazi's. Together they start building a camp in the woods, hidden from the Nazi's, hoping that some day, they don't have to run anymore and can fight back. For once, a WOII movie that doesn't give you the feeling that it's all about a bunch of American Rambo's that slaughter Germans left and right. This one gives an honest view of both sides. Losing faith and loved ones and the side of Jews, and the agony some traitors and Germans have by doing their horrible job for the fuhrer. Of course the Germans are the bad guys, but in this movie you can see that evil is not only on the German side. I would also like to say that Daniel Craig is a great actor. I didn't know what to think about James Bond being in a WOII movie, but he took his role perfectly. Compliments also for Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell. I give this movie a 10/10, maybe I'm a little too enthusiastic about it, but I have never seen anyone applaud during/after a movie. And they were right about this one. See it!! You won't be sorry.",10,2,6,19 January 2009
