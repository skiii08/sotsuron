The Avengers," I used to trust IMDb scores
","I used to trust IMDb scores, but if this movie achieved to get a score above 8 stars, than it is just a reasonable conclusion for me to move on.Without sounding mean, Avengers has nothing, not one single original idea. The script was probably written by a bunch of marketing professionals and a mindless script writing machine.If you find pleasure in having your daily coffee in the McCafe, if you like to buy things on the TV shopping channel, if hanging out in a shopping mall is the ultimate Sunday plan for you, than go for this movie. You will not be disappointed.",1,11,40,13 November 2012
