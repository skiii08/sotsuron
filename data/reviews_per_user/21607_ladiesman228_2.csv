Alien 3," Not that bad, Not that good...
","The first time i saw Alien 3 I was more than a little disappointed, but a few years have passed and having watched it again (and the 'Assembly Cut' from the Box Set) it has actually grown on me! Its dark, bleak, depressing stuff. Looking more like a proper sequel to Alien than Aliens! The film has flaws all over, but it also has its moments, not to mention the best tag-line for an Alien film, 'THE BITCH IS BACK'! For me the series went downhill from Alien: Resurrection, with Alien 3 holding its own up against two classic films. Its not my favourite, but after Cameron's sequel, I think Alien 3 is up there with the original. Dismiss it, but don't miss it!",7,0,0,2 January 2011
Joker," SOLID! But don't believe the hype...
","Joaquin Phoenix's performance is excellent, but the film is flawed, the main offenders being a second act twist that's visible a mile away and a small scene during the ending that feels tacked on.However, you should see this film at least once.",7,76,163,14 October 2019
