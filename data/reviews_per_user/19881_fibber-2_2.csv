The Blair Witch Project," Best movie in ages!( there may be an accidental spoiler in here)
","I saw The Blair Witch project on Sunday, and it left such a powerful impact on me, that i haven't been able to get it out of my mind. It is a film that deeply disturbed me, but that is a compliment! I was so drawn into the film, that i forgot it was fiction....and even though you don't see whatever is chasing heather, josh and Mike, it actually makes it even more horrifying! As soon as the film ended, I was shaking from fright.... my friends and I could not stop discussing all the possibilities  and all the theories we came up with while watching the story unfold....this movie makes you think...and that is what is so great about it... even though it scared the daylights out of me, i want to see it again... also checking out the official website after the film helped to fill in some of the gaps that i found... so my advice is....see this film!!!  And don't sit too close, because  a few people i know had to vomit from the jerky camera motions on the screen!!! This film is a cult classic already...and it hasn't even been out that long!",10,1,2,6 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," I loved it!
","Okay...i just got back from seeing this movie, and it was really, really good! A film about a boy who can see dead people, and the psychologist who tries to help him, it held my interest right from the beginning. Bruce Willis actually did a very good job in this movie, as did the rest of the cast. I am sure that anyone who has read a paper has heard about the surprise ending in this film, and don't worry, i am NOT going to give it away, god forbid... but if you don't see this film then you will be missing out  on one of the best endings in a movie since ' The Usual Suspects'. I don't mean that by the content, but just how i totally did not see it coming... anyway, the film was a bit eerie in parts, and although i am not one who scares easily,  it still managed to give me a little bit of the creeps. I highly recommend this film...the actor who played Cole (his name slips my mind) did a great job, as did everyone else... so that's about it! Go see this film!",8,0,0,9 August 1999
