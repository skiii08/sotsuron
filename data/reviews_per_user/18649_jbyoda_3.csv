The King's Speech," No need to fear
","I went into this with some trepidation that my high hopes would be dashed by a long drawn out plod through the trials and tribulations of 'bertie'. however, i have been left astounded by this film. its tone, and pace were perfect as was the use of humour. it is not often the audience reacts as one but i felt that every single person was living every moment through every stammer. Colin firth was simply outstanding and his delivery was nothing short of sublime. the relationships between him and the queen and with Geoffrey rush were both touching and real without ever lingering too long to make them soft. the whole feel of the film is uplifting and there is a very real sense of personal achievement. if you have to see only one film this year, please make this film the one. you wont live to regret it, and i would wager you will see it a second time.",9,2,4,18 January 2011
Forrest Gump," Timeless
","I don't know Tom Hanks and the likelihood is i will never meet him. However i would be very surprised if this film doesn't rate amongst his best/favourite/one to be proud of when he is talking to his grandchildren It is a timeless classic. i fully expect to be many a persons favourite film of all time. There is nothing about this film not to like, from the catchphrases, the audacious dips into world history and celebrity, its cheeky nods towards serious issues such as child abuse, racism, politics etc. The performances are superb, led from the front by Hanks. I think Bubba is hysterical, Sally field was an inspirational choice for the momma role, and lieutenant Dan nearly steals the show, and would have done if Hanks hadn't absolutely nailed it! THe best thing though about this film is its appeal, you can watch it on DVD on a Monday but if you happened to find it on television in the same week you would watch it again, and yes you would still be saying the catchphrases at the end........My name is Forrest Gump, people call me Forrest Gump.",10,2,5,19 February 2008
Back to the Future," quite simply my favourite ever film
","I have watched this film a hundred times and still do not tire of it. i think the characters are awesome and the journey Marty goes on is fabulous. Excellent idea and i don't think this was wasted by the follow up films either. just a shame that Crsipin glover thought too much of himself to not come back and do the other films. in my opinion one of the best trilogies there is purely on entertainment value. I love the relationship between the doc and Marty, and hysterically how the doc changes from 1985 to 1955. i think the individual performances were excellent and i love the fact that biff just keeps getting covered in horse sh*t!! ace. Love this film",10,1,2,29 October 2006
