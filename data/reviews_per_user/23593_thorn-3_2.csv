Alien 3," The most realistic of the Alien movies.
","Alien 3 is my favorite of the Alien films. It has the dark, unwelcome feel as the original had, but the sense of isolation is beefed up 10 fold. The story matched the former films, and the ending was an excellent and acceptable pay-off. 'Aliens' relied too much on the creatures to tell the story. And the point of the soldiers was to only have a few good skirmishes with the Aliens. No thought involved. Alien 3 had the human edge. We can fight and defeat this thing with our brains, not with guns. This movie shows us courage where we least expect it. Where faith and comradery is the only thing you have left. And Ripley's sacrifice is the final step in saving humanity from the Alien. This movie is a triumph, a perfect ending in a tragic story.",Null,3,4,4 October 1998
Event Horizon," A film worth every second, this movie portrays more than what you're seeing.
","This movie, I admit, is not for everyone. This film is unique, and one of the most original modern sci-fi films I have ever seen. The Event Horizon was DESIGNED to look evil. Its a place where you shouldn't feel welcome or safe. This movie is horrifying, something that most movies now lack. I don't think people now like to be scared and subject to though at the same time. I, for one, loved every second of it. I'm sorry it wasn't longer. Paul Anderson did an excellent job at directing this film, and the score was done perfectly. Think of this movie the next time you look up into the night sky. As the tag-line reads: 'Infinite Space, Infinite Terror'",Null,0,0,4 October 1998
