The King's Speech," Best Partner
","This is a story about a king who suffers from stuttering, George, and a man who makes an effort for getting rid of the king's worry, Lionel. George makes an address instead of his father in front of peoples; however, because of his stuttering, he cannot speak well and he lose his popularity from the listeners. Many doctors try to treat him, though, no one can do it. The king's wife asks a man who comes from a colony, Lionel, to see her husband. At first George does not accept him and is angry with him; however, gradually he acknowledges Lionel, and starts their friendship.While watching this film, I feel a trust and bond between George and Lionel. George is royal and Lionel is a person from a colony, therefore generally it is not usual that they become friends. The fact that they are on a good terms moved me and I also want such a buddy.In addition, what I consider as great is the scene that Kin George fails to speak in a front of a lot of people. Actually, there is no scene which shows he cannot speak well. However, before the cut we can see his situation, such as much sweat and shakes. I think it is a great way invisible information makes us image a visible picture.This film is so good that I want to watch it again.",8,1,1,15 September 2015
Big Fish," Talking About a Life
","A son does not like his father because he always tells a story about his own life as if he read out a fairy tale. The son considers the story as ridiculous therefore he is fed up with the attitude of his father. However as he listens to the story more times, he little by little understands what his father wants to say.What the film shows that; regardless of whether it is true or not, when we get on the edge of death, it is important how we can talk about our own life as a great, bright and happy one. The father's smile in the last scene probably means this.After watching this movie, I cannot help but think about my own life. Though I have not lived for so long, I wonder if I have stories which I will be able to talk to others with smile and proud. Maybe now I do not. From now I will create the story and when I am 80 years old, I hope, I may tell it to my grandchildren.",7,0,0,15 September 2015
Departures," Treating a Death
","A man who is a cellist belonging to a musical group returns to his home town, because the group breaks up. One day he finds a job advertisement and he likes it. However this job is actually an undertaker, who treats a body and encoffins him. He is torn between cellist and undertaker.This film can change an image toward an undertaker. It shows their job as a beautiful and great thing. I feel kind of admirable to them.Treating a death means at the same time thinking about a life. Undertakers put on a lip stick on the lip casting their mind to the past of the body, that is, the time when he or she was alive. The film told me such a thing. Once dealing with bodies was a work for people under discrimination. They were called Eta Hinin, which means dirty and not human. However embalming is now essential work and we should consider them as great workers, I think.",9,0,0,15 September 2015
The Breakfast Club," Let It Be
","On Saturday, five students go to school because their teacher told them to do so. He instructs the students to write compositions about what they are. Since then their friendships start and they review the reasons why they are there and themselves. 'What is myself?' The question is so hard to answer that we need some triggers to make us notice what is us. In this film, one of the triggers is new friends who they have never seen. Each of them is an intelligence, princess, athlete, bad boy and a basket case. They tell stories about their own worries to each other and realize that there is nothing wrong with them. While I watched this process that the characters grow up, felt impressed. In addition I remembered my difficult days as in the story. I have also been worried about myself. Then my temper was not steady and I tended to get irritated for anything. The film made me so nostalgic and it is so nice that it shows problems children in real life have. The movie expresses such a complicated situation of students in adolescence very well. I felt sympathy with each character while watching it. I recommend to you that you should watch this film.",8,0,0,24 June 2015
