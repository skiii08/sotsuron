The Avengers," A once in a lifetime movie
","Avengers is a great movie with awesome action, and a story that is simple enough to follow. It doesn't matter if you have seen earlier MARVEL movies or not, although if you have seen them it will provide great character depth. Each character gets its own moments - both physically and emotionally, but quick witted on liners by Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.) and awesome action pieces by Hulk steals the show. Loki(Tom Hiddleston) has his moments to as major super villain. The movie has humor, and all in the right places. The screenplay, dialogues and dialogue delivery is very good and action pieces are the kind that you have never scene before, especially in last half hour.This movie is EPIC.In short, it a movie that you should not miss and if you do you will regret it later. WELL DONE JOSS WHEDON !!",10,10,21,27 April 2012
