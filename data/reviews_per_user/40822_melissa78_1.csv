The Ring," Quite possibly the worst movie ever.
","The only truly disturbing thing about this movie was that I actually paid money to see it. Afterwards I tried desperately to find something good to cling to so I wouldn't have to admit total failure in having seen it, but I found nothing. I could, however, go on for quite a while about all the problems I had with it. There was no point to the story. There were plot holes I could drive a truck through. There was no resolution to anything. (Although that wasn't a big problem because there really wasn't anything to resolve.) The fact that there are so many people who are raving about this just proves that people have different tastes, which is fine, but it still baffles me. I don't understand how this is scaring people. And I really think that all the people that are talking about it being 'intellectual' and having 'layers' are just trying to sound intellectual themselves, and hide the fact that either they didn't get it, or they understand that there was no plot but feel the need to act like there was. Whatever. This is definitely on my list of 'movies I wish I could un-see.'",Null,0,0,1 November 2002
