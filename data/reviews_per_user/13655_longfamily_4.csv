The Blair Witch Project," About as scary as your big, drunk uncle at the family reunion
","Isn't it amazing. These kids romp around the woods for days with nothing to eat and the female lead is still capable ofhaving one of the largest cabooses in recent cinema history. She should have been glad that she had to run. Sorry I digress. All seriousness aside, though, the scariest thing about 'BWP'(most movies have intials now, so I'll go with it too) is the fact that thousands of moviegoers actually paid hard earned money to see a film that the filmmaker's families  would have found it hard to sitthrough.   Evidently the lack of food must have also robbed the characters of their ability to come up with any cohesive dialogue besides the F word. Or maybe that was just the ineptitude of the filmmakers who wrote the 'script'(I use this term loosely). One last note: There was a sequel as we all know and for allthe agnostics out there who have trouble believing in God look no further than the box office receipts for the second one. And lo God spared us a third go round.",Null,0,1,5 November 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg's continuing downslide
","Contains Spoilers It may be fashionable to trash popular films, but I try to make it a habit only to trash truly bad ones. Such is the case of 'Saving Private Ryan', one of the worst best picture nominees in recent years(alongside 'Gladiator' which won the award). What makes it so bad? How do I count the ways. The twitching finger of Jeremy Davies. The incredibly bad soliloquy delivered by Private Ryan(Matt Damon). The stupid decision (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) of Tom Hanks and Co. to let Private Ryan have  his way and stay and fight off the Germans in spite of all the crap the team went to in trying to locate him. The German who threatens the life of Hanks and Co. and then when they decide to let him live he comes back to haunt them again. What are the chances of having problems with the same psychotic German twice when there are so many other enemies lurking about? What about the ending of the film which makes no sense?(Think about it-Private Ryan couldn't be remembering everything that happens in the entire film, he wasn't even there during DDay, at least we didn't see him. Spielberg continues his sad slide after 'The Lost World' and 'Amistad'. Hopefully 'AI' was better.",Null,1,2,27 September 2001
Good Will Hunting," It's not your fault, It's not your fault, It's not your fault
","(Possible spoilers here, though there really isn't much to spoil). What can you say about a film about a janitor with some serious emotional hangups who just happens to be the smartest guy on the planet. All I can say is that it's lucky for him he has a psychiatrist who apparently only has one patient('Good' Will Hunting, get it?). 'Good' Will Huting is also doubly luck that his psychiatrist with one patient is able to solve all of his problems by saying 'It's not your fault'(say it repeatedly as one time only won't do the trick).      This film was made for one reason only. As a launching pad for the wondertwins Matt and Ben, or Damon and Affleck if you prefer. Let us not forget that Matt and Ben not only starred in this piece but they wrote it as well. They also took home the oscar for their writing efforts. They proved to be so adept at their writing skills that  they have written ten films since then(sarcasm anyone?) Robin Williams' beard gives  a wonderful performance and Robin Williams' does okay himself as the doctor with one patient who helps Will overcome his problems. Just don't forget that Robert Forster and Burt Reynolds were passed up for their wonderful work in 'Jackie Brown' and 'Boogie Nights' so that Robin Williams' could get his 'long overdue' oscar. All is not lost because the success of this film gave director Gus Van Sant the clout to desecrate Hitchcock's 'Psycho'.",Null,1,4,3 November 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," The most universally hailed and hated film of all time
","Let's say that you are a director. A very succesful director who has lots of clout and access to all of the best cinematic technology that money can buy. You then spend four years trying to figure out what to do with all of the expensive sets and crew that you have hired. You never figure out what to do with them and so you string together some excuse for a narrative,never clearly defining what it is you are attempting to say. The punchline to the joke is that the masses latch onto your undefined ideas and immediately take them as brilliance. It then becomes as contagious as the black plague and pretty soon everyone seems to 'know' what the director was trying to say even though the director himself had no idea what he was saying. Multiply this by 34 years and you have a certified classic. This was the perfect marriage of eye popping visuals with a plodding, empty headed script. Kudos to Doug Trumbull's effects.",Null,4,7,6 November 2002
