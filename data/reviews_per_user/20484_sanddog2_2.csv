Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Best Movie of the Year
","Absolutely the best movie, i played it soooooooooooo many times i had to get a new movie. I am not saying i am a total geek for star wars but i do love the movies and the books. George Lucas is a very good director, he made a good cast for this movie. There was only one problem ..... if it is a long long time ago and a galaxy far far away why does obi wan have a british accent??????",10,0,1,24 May 2000
Pulp Fiction," Hated
","This movie was not enough for even one star, it had had too much of a plot twist and the acting was awful. the only good thing about it was the fact that it had guns a blazing and john travolta in it. If its one movie you want to watch in a movie store, skip over this hunk a junk",1,8,33,24 May 2000
