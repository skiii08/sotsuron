The Blair Witch Project," This movie is not...
","Are you the type of person who wants everything spelled out for you?  Are you the type of person who must have every single question a movie raises, answered?  Are you the type of person who wants tons of blood and gore to scare you?If you answered yes to any of these questions, do NOT see this movie.The Blair Witch Project is a rare film, perhaps the only one I've seen, that doesn't give you everything you want to hear.  It will scare the pants off of you, but only if you let it.  Seeing the website ahead of time works.But if you're like me and didn't see the site, the very style of the movie will draw you in.  It's a Real World-cum-documentary device that's used, and it's used to perfection.  The point of view of the movie gives us an almost intrusive angle on the entire story.  Instead of giving us detailed bios on the characters, the movie lets its own technique draw us in.  Brilliant. (If you NEED detailed bios, or anything of the sort, see the site.)The whole thing is eerie.  The images from the film are with me a week after seeing it, and it scared me quite nicely.  There are people who don't get it, don't understand it, or simply don't like the way the movie 'looked'. Great.  Go see something flashy, then.  (Heck, one guy I know complained that the film didn't take up the whole screen!)  If you're looking for minor appearance details, you'll hate this film.If, on the other hand, you want: a creative story that gives you enough but not too much, a set of characters you grow to bond and identify with, and a suspenseful ending, this is the one to see.  4.5/5.0 stars.",9,1,1,7 August 1999
Unbreakable," A waste of time.
","I'm very sorry to report that Unbreakable is not what it seems to be.  It seems to be a movie about a man who is, well, unbreakable... Bruce Willis's character, Dunne, appears to be some sort of superhero.Like the other reviews, I'm afraid I can't give away much of the plot without giving away the film.  I will say that the overall main plot is a fine idea, but the execution - particularly in the final third of the film - is a yawner.  The director tries to surprise us as he did in The Sixth Sense, but comes up short.Subplots, which are few and far between, are filled with characters you won't care about.  Only Dunne's son turns in a fair performance, but that's only due to one scene.  We don't get more than a glimpse into the other people: Dunne's wife, Price's mother, Dunne's son.  That'd be fine if the concentration on Dunne was intense and interesting enough to sustain the film.  It's not.I can not overstate how very disappointed I was in this film's all-too-neat wrap up.  It felt, honestly, like I was watching an hourlong TV show that had just 2 minutes left before the credits.  As an added bonus, the overall point and theme of this movie is shrouded in mystery... which, again, would be fine if the film itself was gripping, moving, or soul-stirring.  Too bad it's not.There's no doubt that M. Night Shyamalan is blessed with talent.  That talent comes off as an unexciting attempt at some sort of story, here. Maybe next time.  I want my money back.Rating: 1.5 stars (out of 5.)",3,0,1,25 November 2000
American Pie," Surprise! Pretty good pie.
","I was surprised.  I had seen the trailers, as did everyone, supposedly giving away the movie's finer moments.  A few are in there, but there are many more enjoyable ones.The plot is a little thin, I'll give it that.  (I like a little meat on my plots ;)  Acting is sufficient, casting is about on-target, and the whole thing is a little too long.But is it funny?  On the whole, yeah.  It's not sophisticated humor by far, and it's very much in-your-face, but a good number of the scenes had me laughing out loud.  The biggest caveat is that I probably would have enjoyed it more if I was about 16 and still in high school.But male high school seniors as virgins?  Proof that this is fictional. 4.0/5.0 stars.",Null,0,0,11 July 1999
Empire Records," Putrid. Annoying. Loathsome.
","This noxious, fecal, rancid excuse for a film had me terribly disgusted throughout.  The plot feels much like something out of a poor NBC sitcom; in fact, NBC might've done a better job with it.  The cast was totally stereotypical and unexciting, the idea was formulaic, and I felt cheated out of my time and money by seeing this movie.0.0/5.0 stars.",1,5,16,4 July 1999
Empire Records," Perhaps one of the most pointless films ever.
","I can not believe this made it to film.  Truly a disgusting piece of work. It was colorful, it was poorly acted, it was pointless, and the entire plot was something like a joke.  The only reason to see it might be Renee Zellweger, but even THAT is a stretch.  Highly unrecommended.",1,3,10,26 March 1999
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Great, classic film making...
","One Flew Over is an amazing book/movie combo in that both pieces interact somewhat, but stand on their own well.  The book is amazing and well worth the read.  The movie is different enough in point of view and events to make it stand on its own.Nicholson is, as almost always, incredible in the McMurphy character. It's amazing that you can laugh at something in one scene ('Little dab'll do ya, huh?') and then see the results of this same character in the final scenes. The character of Chief is perfectly portrayed, and in fact every patient comes through with his or her character intact.It's also great to watch!  Truly a classic.  5.0/5.0 stars.",9,1,3,5 July 1999
The Sixth Sense," Don't compare, just enjoy it...
","Having seen Blair Witch last weekend and now Sixth Sense, I tell you, I will have problems sleeping for the next week or two.The Sixth Sense is a wonderfully crafted and executed tale about a young boy (Cole) who has (surprise!) a sixth sense: he can see and talk to the dead as if they were right there with the living.  A neat twist of a psychic nature, no?  The boy finds that he himself has a mission of sorts after dealing with horrific visions of the dead.  I won't divulge anything about the mission.Willis' character, whose name eludes me at the moment, also finds that he has a mission.  His wife is growing distant, and it's up to him to get refocused on his wife instead of his career.  I mean, having someone attack you probably would provoke you into correcting a career-based mistake, don't you think?The ending is 100% pure shocking and I will say that it was excellent.But as a side note, lots of people are quick to compare this to Blair Witch. I've got to say that to do that is, to me, quite silly.  Blair Witch works on a VERY different level than The Sixth Sense.  This particular film is a tad slow, but patience is a virtue.  If you can be patient with it, you'll reap the rewards.Also great acting all around.  This gets 4.0/5.0 stars from me.",8,0,0,7 August 1999
The Matrix," Wow oh wow!
","This ranks in my mind with 12 Monkeys and The Truman Show insofar as being able to muck with your perception of reality.  An incredibly great idea finally executed well on screen.  And surprisingly, Keanu Reeves is... good! Not great, but... good!  (He does get a trademark 'whoa' in once, however.)The plot kind of slumps towards the end, and Moss's character deevolves from a strong one to near typical, which I was disappointed with.The effects are incredible, plain and simple.  You sit there and believe it's real... yet it's unreal.  That's impressive stuff.This movie might not be perfect, but it comes mighty close.  4.5/5.0 stars.",Null,0,0,27 June 1999
