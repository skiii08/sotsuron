Black Swan," Black Swan is an interesting but flawed film.
","Natalie Portman plays a dancer, Nina Sayers, struggling to play the role of a lifetime as the Swan Queen and her evil twin in a new adaptation of the ballet Swan Lake.Nina is perfectly cast as the Swan Queen, but not as her evil twin. Black Swan is a story about the fear of transformation, fear of her love for perfection, fear of her body, even the fear of her own mother.The first of many transformations occurs with her supplanting the previous star, Beth Macintyre played by Winona Ryder, who has been cast aside by the New York ballet company. The company's director is Thomas Leroy, played by Vincent Cassel. He chooses Nina, but has already forewarned her that although she may be technically gifted she needs to consume herself in the darker, more sensual evil twin of the Swan Queen. Thomas instantly realises that although Nina is a beautiful woman, she is sexually naive. He asks her to find herself sexually, with him, herself or any way possible. He also instructs her to watch Lily, a free- spirited newcomer who would fit perfectly into the role of the evil twin.Black Swan is a study of the psychological trauma of coping and adapting to change, of a woman growing up. Nina has a demanding mother, played by Barbara Hershey, who herself was a ballerina until she became pregnant and had to retire to bring up Nina. Nina becomes more anxious the further she goes into rehearsals, hallucinations and anxiety attacks worsen the more stressed she becomes not just from performances but from the continued overbearing interference from her mother.Scenes are shot close-up, to heighten the sense of claustrophobia, whether in her mothers small apartment or when she is performing. The opening scene is a brilliantly shot close-up of the demands and dynamics of ballet. Throughout the whole film we are blessed with a stunning score from Tchaikovsky, used with great effect not just in the dance sequences but to underscore the changing tensions in Nina's transformation, especially near the end of the film.I was full of apprehension before seeing Black Swan. I've seen all of Darren Aronofsky's films and much like Wes Anderson's films, I've always left feeling short-changed and wondering what all the fuss was with the director. Thankfully, there is much to admire and this is Aronofsky's best film. But i am still not convinced. There are just too many clichés in the plot; the jealous mother, the bitter deposed star ballerina, the lecherous director. Some of the scenes were laughable, such as 'that' scene with Nina and Lily. Barbara Hershey is excellent, suitably unhinged and psychotic in equal measure. Vincent Cassel was wasted as the Director, his part was too muddled and as fine an actor as he is, he looked every inch the stereotypical cartoon villain.Natalie Portman's character baffled me, this was a woman who's only desire was to dance but there was no genuine love for ballet, her drive seemed more of a compulsion. Perhaps, she is merely a vessel to act out her mothers dreams. Any warmth for Nina's craft was only ever realised at the end. Much like the film itself, Natalie Portman's performance was good but not as great as the critics are saying. She just wasn't as convincing in her part as Barbara Hershey was in hers as the mother, Portman's lack of range is quite evident. And yes i noticed it as well, Portman plays the part of 'Nina the Ballerina'! Come on Darren, what were you thinking!?Aronofsky does make an interesting reference to art and obsession, is the obsessive drawn to art because of its relentless search for perfection, or does the artist become obsessive simply as a function of their 'profession'? He also highlights the age old question of whether art and perfection can exist without instinct, for me it doesn't but i am sure many would disagree. But I don't think Aronosfsky has said anything new in this film.Once the credits appeared and i got up to leave the cinema, i noticed the majority of the audience were female. Perhaps women would appreciate this film more than men, perhaps? Black Swan is an interesting but flawed film.",6,2,4,27 January 2011
The Secret in Their Eyes," Brilliant Argentinian movie
","The Oscars rarely picks the correct 'Best Picture' but what were the odds of neither 'A Prophet' or 'White Ribbon' not winning the famous statue in 2010? So when the relatively unknown Argentinian film 'The secret in their eyes' pipped the aforementioned films, i took notice. I had to wait a long time to see it, and then my beloved Duke of Yorks cinema could only show it once, at 2:30pm on a Wednesday afternoon! I had to go, leaving work early, my colleagues bemused why it was so important to see an Argentinian movie at such an odd hour!I'd recently seen another good Argentinian movie, XXY, which cast the same lead actor, Ricardo Darin, as in this film. 'The Secret in their eyes' centres around the rape and murder of a young woman. Darin plays federal justice agent Benjamin Esposito, who is responsible for solving the murder, aided by his alcoholic assistant Pablo Sandoval, and his new boss Irene Menendez Hastings. What is essentially a formulaic plot is transformed by some superb acting and excellent direction. The film effortlessly weaves between a murder mystery and a love story, using flashback, current, and flash-forward techniques due to the story being told 25 years after the murder by Benjamin, now retired and decided to write a book about the murder.There are moments in the film that seem more at home as television melodrama, and the plot at times is shaky in its deductions. The ending felt like it was from a Stephen King novel, but no less affective and certainly caught me by surprise. As the title to the film suggests, everything is in their eyes, and the acting by everyone was excellent. Sandoval in particular, played by Guillermo Francello, is both hilarious and touching as the alcoholic sidekick. Beautifully paced direction from Juan Jose Campanella, with echoes of the best in Hollywood film noir. Overall, a wonderful film with many admirable qualities.",8,1,2,12 January 2011
The White Ribbon," A Masterpiece
","White Ribbon, directed by Michael Haneke, is set in a rural Protestant community in a German village on the eve of World War I. The village is run by an aristocratic estate in which everyone knows their place in the social order, from the doctor, pastor, teacher, to the migrant labourers.The film begins with the locals being terrorised by a series of anonymous criminal acts: a doctor is hurt whilst on his horse which was tripped by a wire; a woman dies in a sawmill; a barn is set ablaze. The film is shaped by the children's perspective, we learn through their harsh experiences that none is without guilt just as none is quite without innocence. Haneke offers mere suggestions as to why people turn to antisocial behaviour, whether it's sabotaging a crop of cabbages, or assaulting a disabled child. Shame is ever-present in this film, the 'white ribbon' of the title is a band tied by the pastor around the arms of naughty children, sometimes for the most innocent and harmless mistakes. Apart from the Baron's son and a handicapped boy, there is no room for the children to be themselves and be loved, every last detail of non-conformity is inspected and punished.This film may have begun with criminality but the tone set by this film is of utter viciousness. This film is about the damage which affects us all, the loss of innocence, the slow, creeping brutality of man, and spiritual myopia. Haneke pays particular attention to the violence inflicted by the higher echelons of the community, especially the pastor and the physical and mental abuse by the doctor not only on his children but also towards his occasional mistress. In one particularly vicious scene, the verbal abuse handed out to her is particularly merciless.The photography is truly breathtaking, with superb acting throughout by the large cast. The sadistic undertones in this film are typical of Haneke. He hasn't lost the ability to shock with some very unsettling moments, but it's his least aggressive film. We are even treated to a tender romance resulting in a sublimely innocent kiss. In a village devoid of any love and affection, this romance seems the only sign of any optimism.We don't know what sparked the birth of fascism, we can only speculate. There are of course parallels today with the many forms of hate and extremism disguised as religion, not just in Islam. The village may have showed us how much has changed in a hundred years, but perhaps the point of this film is that little has changed, and that man has forgotten his parental responsibilities and committed only to control and greed.",9,0,3,12 January 2011
The Intouchables," Directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have struck comedy gold.
","Based on a true story, 'Untouchable' is a comedy about the unlikely friendship between Philippe (François Cluzet) and Driss (Omar Sy). Philippe is a wealthy man, paralysed from the neck down due to a paragliding accident. Tired of the sycophancy and pitying care given to him due to his condition and his wealth, Philippe takes a gamble and hires the brutally frank Driss who only applied for the job to keep the benefits office happy.Philippe gets far more than he bargained for with the charisma whirlwind that is Driss, a young man who is never afraid to say what he thinks or lower the tone and is guaranteed to keep everybody smiling. Theirs is a cross-cultural friendship, drawn together by their mutual honesty and sense of humour. 'Untouchable' is an unashamed crowd-pleaser, the friendship between Philippe and Driss is undeniable and the jokes bounce along at a merry pace. A lot of the humour is based on the clash with cultural stereotypes, the film often lacks subtlety but Sy and Cluzet pull it all off handsomely. There is a lot of playfulness and mischief from both Philippe and Driss, the hilarious opening sequence of Driss speeding through Paris traffic and betting with Philippe that he could get away from the police is priceless.'Untouchable' is an irreverent take on disability, Driss is hardly subtle with Philippe's condition but his forcefulness and boyish enthusiasm energises Philippe. The film works because Philippe is in on the jokes, it would be too easy for him to be the butt of all the jokes. Philippe is aware of the stuffy bourgeois hypocrisy that he inhabits and perpetuates, and thanks to Driss's anarchic influence plays a great trick on his art dealer. To the films credit there is a lack of sentimentality, nothing is glossed over but its evident what each of their many disadvantages are. Some people may frown at the often patronising stereotyping and the treatment of a character with a disability, but the films heart is in the right place.Mismatched friendships and cultural clashes are nothing new and 'Untouchable' is often predictable, but when Cluzet and Sy click they're an irresistible double-act to burn through any cynicism you may have left. Directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have struck comedy gold.",8,5,9,5 November 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Anderson's most accomplished film yet, it's his most genuine work and will certainly make you smile.
","Wes Anderson's dazzling comedy caper 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' tells the story of legendary millionaire Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). Situated in the Republic of Zubrowka, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a gloriously pink old Baroque European establishment where rich people go to spend time. It is here where Zero started as the hotel's lobby boy.In 1932, young Zero (Tony Revolori) was hired and worked under the direct tutelage of legendary concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes). One of his most loyal customers, Madame D. (Tilda Swinton), passes away leaving him an invaluable painting, much to the annoyance of her despicable son and heir Dmitri (Adrien Brody) who frames Gustave for Madame D's murder.This charming hotel is a cinematic event in itself, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is very much a filmmakers film with some outstanding cinematography. Everyone from Anderson to the art directors, set designers, cinematographers, and composer are as much the stars in an all-star line-up including Bill Murray, Mathieu Amalric, Saoirse Ronan, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Willem Defoe, Léa Seydoux, and Jeff Goldblum.Gustave is a hilarious creation, so typically English in his genteel courtesies, wit and humility. Fiennes is perfectly cast and must have relished playing such a delightful character. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' has an energy which previous films by Anderson lacked, told with a much more purposeful sense of storytelling which feels real.I've never been a fan of Andersons cultivated brand of quirks and charms, films with irritating characterisations and cameos, mannered dialogue and contrived use of twee and nostalgia. And what does he see in Owen Wilson? Above all of this and much more, his films often lack any genuine character development, resulting in often uninteresting films full of sheen and little substance. But in Gustave H. he's finally crafted a well- rounded individual which we can believe in and appreciate, regardless of how fantastical he appears.'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is Anderson's most accomplished film yet, it's his most genuine work and will certainly make you smile.",8,1,4,9 March 2015
12 Years a Slave," '12 Years A Slave' is a savage account of slavery and the Americans treatment of black people.
","Steve McQueens new film '12 Years A Slave' is an adaptation of the memoirs of Solomon Northup, a free black American violinist from New York who was kidnapped and sold as a slave to a Louisiana plantation owner in 1841.Solomon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) has a wife (Kelsey Scott) and children, and was enticed by a couple of showmen to play for a lot of money. After a heavy night of drinking with these men, he awakes to quickly realise that he is to be taken to New Orleans to meet the first of many unscrupulous men who use him as a slave. Slave trader Theophilus Freeman (Paul Giamatti) gives Solomon his new slave name Platt, and sells him to plantation owner Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). As the film title suggests Northup spends the next 12 years as a slave, not just with Ford but also for an even more wicked cotton plantation owner, Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender).'Sin, there is no sin. I can do as I wish with my property', Epps is the quintessential hate- figure, a renowned 'nigger breaker' who shows no compunction in lacerating his slaves whenever he chooses. By the time Northup becomes Epps' property, McQueens' singular focus on Northup's nightmare is all too real and harrowing. Northup dominates the film, but the strength of '12 Years A Slave' is not just in showing what he has gone through but that for the women its far worse. Women are regularly torn from their children who are sold separately, the likes of Patsy (Lupita Nyong'o) suffer the added torment of rape. Patsy is Epps' mistress of choice, not only does she suffer the abuse from him but also from the jealous Mrs Epps (Sarah Paulson) who is as equally vengeful.Its an understatement to say that '12 Years A Slave' isn't an easy watch, McQueens unflinching and unsentimental film relives America's enslavement of black people in all its horror. There is so much detail in this film, even the language is historically accurate. Although filmed impeccably, there's a lot of economy in McQueens artistic flourishes, which is a shame. Everything is shown through the tormented eyes of the slaves, specifically Northup. McQueen isn't afraid to prolong the agony for maximum emotional impact, not least in the incredible hanging sequence where Northup's toes are barely touching the damp muddy ground. Its a thought-provoking and poignant moment, showing us not just the excruciating pain and suffering he had to endure but that all the other slaves carried on as normal for fear of similar reprisals if they helped him.'12 Years A Slave' has some superb performances by a very strong cast, the big surprise being the unknown Nyong'o who is superb as Patsy. The film unearths devastating performances from the two outstanding British actors Fassbender and Ejiofor, using opposing techniques to flesh out their roles. The more theatrical Fassbender is repellent to the core, the epitome of evil. His faith in his religion and his own manipulation of it is a sad and all too real indictment of how religion is used to justify the worst in men. Ejiofor is spellbinding as the more internalised Northup, using his body and face to convey Northup's terror and anguish. And those eyes, those pained eyes of his which shows a normally articulate man inhibited by his inability to speak up for fear of being beaten or far worse.'12 Years A Slave' is a savage account of slavery and the Americans treatment of black people. Slavery may be a thing of the past, but the film does also highlight the fact that enslavement comes in many forms and that it does still exist, its just not as visible.",8,3,5,13 January 2014
Whiplash," A perfectly timed film from Damien Chazelle.
","Damien Chazelle's 'Whiplash' is the story of Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller), a promising young jazz drummer who is under the brutal tutelage of Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons) at New York's fictional Shaffer Conservatory.'Whiplash' is essentially a battle of wills between Neyman and Fletcher, an unhealthy student/mentor relationship that frequently teeters on the brink of collapse. Fletcher uses harsh and disciplined teaching methods, and everyone is scared to death in his presence. His military-style methods work, as his school's concert band regularly wins competitions and breaks students into successful careers.Fletcher justifies his behaviour with repeated references to a long-repeated anecdote about the young Jazz legend Charlie Parker, who was playing a solo at a jam session with professionals which included the great drummer Jo Jones. Parker played so badly that Jones threw a cymbal at his head, nearly decapitating him. After that humiliation and intimidation, Parker practiced so long and so hard that he came back a year later and made Jazz history with his solo.'Whiplash' is a simplistic film about the Jazz world, Neyman plays a lot but you never see him in any other band such as his own, he doesn't jam with his fellow students, which seems odd when a drummer can't function in a jazz band without others. Chazelle is more interested in the lonely and singular ambition Neyman has, and the exposure he will get.The abuse of power is central to this film, Fletcher wants to teach Neyman to take responsibility and to prove himself. But where is the line between motivation and abuse? Fletcher is looking for his own Charlie Parker, the question is whether Neyman will cut it.For all its flaws, 'Whiplash' is a film worth watching. It's snappy pacing is as sharp as Neyman's drumming, and equally well executed. Both Fletcher and Neyman have questionable motives who are as bad as each other, and their relentless battle keeps you riveted and often amused. Teller and Simmons are both perfectly suited in their roles, and the latter steals most of the scenes with his barrage of verbal abuse at his students. A perfectly timed debut from Damien Chazelle.",8,3,5,9 March 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," For all of the films technical marvels, its Keaton's bravura performance which shines through and defines this ambitious film
","Alejandro González Iñárritu's 'Birdman', stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson, an ageing movie star whose glory days seems to have dried up decades ago. Desperate to recapture recognition and relevance, Thompson sinks all his time and money into writing, directing and starring in a Broadway play adaptation of Raymond Carver's 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love'.Thompson is buckling under the pressure, close to a breakdown. Surrounded by friends and family who have their own share of problems, from his daughter and assistant Sam (Emma Stone), his friend and lawyer Jake (Zach Galifianakis), to his girlfriend and co-star Laura (Andrea Riseborough), up and coming actress Lesley (Naomi Watts) and egocentric superstar Mike (Ed Norton). They all contrive to dismantle and fix something that maybe never should have existed.Iñárritu bravely shoots the film as if it was in one take, the camera flows in and out of various rooms in the theatre, following all the various characters in a whirlwind of actions. The film has an elegant dynamism, but you are never allowed to ponder moments any longer than a few seconds, as if the film depended on it. As beautifully constructed as it is, Iñárritu keeps things fresh by avoiding complete precision. The random and the inexplicable are allowed just as much space. The films tension and free- wheeling energy is also derived from the manic scenarios and the uneven jazzy drum score, in an all-or-nothing journey into Thompson's mind.'Birdman' is a dizzying and absurd experience, and Iñárritu leaves no stone unturned in savaging the vacuous world of Hollywood celebrity, showbiz and our relentless pursuit for shock and entertainment. Not only does 'Birdman' take potshots at everyone from Meg Ryan to Justin Bieber to Robert Downey Jnr, it includes its own actors with thinly veiled nods to their previous output, methods and celebrity profiles. Its a shame that for all its biting lunacy, the story is a well-worn path with few insights. For all of the films technical marvels, its Keaton's bravura performance which shines through and defines this ambitious film, his electric descent into chaos and salvation is surely his finest performance.",8,0,3,9 March 2015
