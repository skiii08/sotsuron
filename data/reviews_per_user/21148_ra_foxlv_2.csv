Resident Evil: Afterlife," Cheese fest + good paced action
","Tokyo slow-mo opening scene was amazing.Soundtrack is out of this world, it felt authentic but at the same time brought back good old MM feel from original RE. I re-watched the movie and almost every time I heard a track on background it felt as if it was taken from some other movie (except the opening). Honestly, RE:A doesn't deserve it just because they are on completely different levels but it saves the movie for me, plus the pacing of it.It's a super cheese fest, sometimes I even felt as if watching a Bollywood movie - on a brink of a laugh. At the very least I had a grin.Performances. Well, Jovovich is good but best performance goes to Kim Coates, even being as small as it is. And Wentworth Miller is so Prison Break... seems like he adapts one attitude to everything, no diversity.Besides that I don't like movies which change cameras for some of scenes, they feel out of place, the well known FPS is different and it just destroys that momentary believability you have, if you can have one for RE:A at all.Yet I think it's a good evening entertainment watch and if you have a keen ear then the OST should become one of your favorites.",3,5,11,19 October 2010
Orphan," Worst scare 'thriller' seen in years.
","When you see a thriller, you expect something which is going to catch you guessing and tense from the moment you discover the reason till it's finally cleared. There was nothing to guess about this movie, the disgusting absurdity of actions made me faceplam how weird and convenient everyone acts around protagonist. Worst movie formula for me. I happen to dislike it a lot, because it's so easy to make everyone hate one person, make him/her look bad just because it has to be so. If the story would have been presented without really showing real deeds of Esther and it would have been discovered in the end as a revelation - that would make it a lot more interesting.I really can't say anyone acted that well above ordinary level, though I do like Vera Farmiga.So overall it's a downhill for me with cheap story and annoying, predictable, extremely absurd 'coincidences' which the story revolves around.I can't make my tongue call this movie a thriller. But the end left me less bitter, though that's absolutely not enough to earn the movie points for overall performance.",1,5,17,23 October 2009
