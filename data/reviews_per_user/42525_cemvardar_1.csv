Minority Report," Good story/idea but not that good movie(Slight Spoilers)
","When watching a sci-fi or a fantastic movie can we claim that there are plot holes? Can someone say Superman movies does not make sense because man can't fly? In my opinion what one should look for in a sci-fi/fantastic movie is the logic within that movie itself. Every sci-fi movie creates a world and logic of its own and I prefer to judge each movie by its own logic. And I think this is fair. I just watched 'Minority Report'. I really liked the story. The twist about 'setup/not-a-setup' was one of the greatest twist I have ever seen but...-Everybody's eyes are scanned everywhere but you can do whatever you like within a police building with one(not two:)) eye ball of the wanted guy? Give me a break. -Get away from the very same building by flushing off the pool with the most important thing in that building? Give me another break.-'Hey we caught your murderer Anne Lively, now stay here and wait your real murderer. He should be here in a couple of minutes' pleeeeeeeeeease...-The logic of the movie depends on the fact that precogs can only foresee murders but Agatha can foresee everything when leading Anderton out of the mall.-'I am taking you to a safe place. My wife's house. They would never look for a fugitive in his wife's house. I am not stupid agatha you are stupid:))'I think a good sci-fi movie has every right to have its own logic/world provided that it stays consistent with that logic and does not have really stupid heroes/villain. As a conclusion, I think, Minority Report's story is a great story but Spielberg/Screenwriters did not do their homework well and produced just a good movie although they could have created a great movie with just some more effort.",Null,0,0,21 December 2002
