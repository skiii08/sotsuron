The Blair Witch Project," Interesting Idea...Overblown Film
","First of all, I must give high marks to the producers of this movie and to Artisan Films for one of the most imaginative advertising campaigns I have ever experienced. The TV 'teasers' and the website - not to mention the various ancillary products (especially, 'The Blair Witch Project: A Dossier) associated with the movie were uniformly first rate and whetted my appetite for the movie.Upon first viewing the movie, I was feeling rather foolish - I (and, apparently, millions of other had been 'had). What I saw was a short movie with a great premise and a few really good suspenseful/scary scenes that had been stretched out to feature length by seemingly endless footage of the hapless principals wandering about lost in the woods and - even worse - continually whining about it. I was not a happy camper.Later, a few other members of my family saw the movie and they literally ranted and raved about how creepy it was and how a woman they saw at a local carnival was the spitting image of Mary Brown. This incident triggered a large number of conversations among their friends and family. The capper came when my wife watched it on Cable and it gave her the major 'willies'.I began to think that maybe I had been too harsh in my judgment and that this movie deserved another viewing.Well, I have watched this movie about a half dozen times and I have good news and bad news. The good news is that it can be spooky fun for a while. The bad news is that the total quality time in this movie amounts to only about 1/3 of the running length.I am still impressed with the concept and with the genuinely creepy look of some of the scenes but the best score I can muster is 5 points out of 10.I would really like the originators of this movie (or someone else who sees the potential for a really GOOD horror movie here) to re-imagine the project and , perhaps, include more of the back story (Rustin Parr and the Blair Witch herself). By the way, I do not consider 'Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows' to be even close to this idea. The less said about this the better.",5,0,2,6 July 2004
