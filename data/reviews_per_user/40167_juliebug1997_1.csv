United 93," A Must See
","I have al4ways wanted to laugh at people who jump up at scary movies and yell out 'Run! Run!'. I always wanted to turn around and say 'It's just a movie!' This might just be a movie--a re-enactment--but during parts of the movie, I wanted to do just that. I wanted all those people sitting in the waiting area to get up and leave. I wanted to be in the room with the air traffic controllers and tell them what was going on. It compelled me to want to do those things. This was a great movie and, even though we all know what's coming at the end of the movie, you will still feel stunned. Bravo to the pretty much unknown cast: I recognized a few from commercials and other TV shows and Faye from 'Wings' was in it. See it.",10,4,8,10 July 2006
