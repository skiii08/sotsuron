Kill Bill: Vol. 2," EXCELLENT conclusion.
","I'll just come out right away and say it. Kill Bill Volume 2 is an AWESOME sequel-slash- conclusion to the thrill ride that was Volume 1.You can't say that about many movie series these days.If you're expecting more of the same with Volume 2, you may be disappointed. First off, the pacing is considerably slower. There is a lot more dialog, more laughs, more character development. Those itching for some serious butt-kicking will get their kicks for sure, though these sequences aren't nearly as prevalent as in the first.I cannot recommend this movie enough. The best I have seen this year. Kill Bill Volume 1 AND 2 are definitely in my top five favorites. See it on the big screen. Be amazed.",9,0,1,24 April 2004
Howl's Moving Castle," Miyazaki delivers again
","I love these experiences I get from Miyazaki, I never fail to be moved or affected in some way after watching one of his films. Whether it's transporting the viewer to another world completely or simply portraying the subtle visual nuances of a character, not many film makers can compare.Howl's Moving Castle is a wonderfully bizarre, imaginative tale and serves as the perfect basis for Miyazaki's vision and style. Though it's not quite up there with Spirited Away or Mononoke Hime, Miyazaki doesn't disappoint and the film is filled with breathtaking visuals, charming characters, humor, romance, drama, all of it. I was a little apprehensive seeing the dubbed version, but my doubts were unfounded as the English actors all did a great job.I had a couple of minor gripes about the film. The story doesn't seem as solid and cohesive as Miyazaki's earlier works, if I had to use one word to describe it it would be 'scattered'. The characters also seem to lack the depth of those in other Miyazaki films and I would think this is because much of their histories and motives are left unexplained, the viewer is left to simply accept them as they are, left wanting more.Compared to other Miyazaki films, Howl's Moving Castle doesn't quite feel as complete. Compared to any other animated offering out there, this film (along with the rest of Miyazaki's), is in a league of its own. An amazing film experience - do not miss it!",8,4,6,12 June 2005
Dawn of the Dead," A satisfying horror movie.
","Wow, what a ride! I'm not familiar with the original film so I cannot make comparisons, but this is a great flick. I watched the horrid 'Soul Survivors' with Eliza Dushku last night and I was desperate for a horror movie done right. Dawn of the Dead is one such horror flick!The opening sequence gets the blood pumping before the opening credits even roll, and while Dawn of the Dead isn't a non-stop rollercoaster of blood 'n guts, it is paced nicely and will keep you entertained from start to finish. Speaking of blood 'n guts, Dawn of the Dead has some slightly graphic scenes but really this is pretty tame. There is an atmosphere of menace and dread and the moment you put yourself in the character's shoes, you have chills running up and down your spine.The acting is pretty standard fare, bordering on quite good. For casual movie fans and horror junkies alike, Dawn of the Dead is an enjoyable watch.",8,0,1,10 June 2004
Finding Nemo," A gem.
","Hands down - this is the best movie I have seen all year. These days it's rare to come across a flick that has you walking out of the theater feeling like you really did get your money's worth, Finding Nemo is one of these.Being a late session, the entire audience consisted of teen/adult viewers and I feel confident enough to say, judging from the incredible amount of laughter, everyone enjoyed it. I certainly did.The three major selling points. The gorgeous rendered visuals, Pixar continues to out do themselves with every film they produce. You can't help but be amazed, and if it weren't for the colorful cartoony fish darting around on screen, you would swear this was filmed live.Secondly, the amazing voice acting, I dare say this film wouldn't have done half as well without it. You'll recognize a number of familiar voices in this film and they all do a wonderful job, but I have to say it, Ellen Degeneres completely steals the show. Her characterization of Dory had myself and the audience in stitches many a time.Bucket loads of humor and action mixed with some drama and quiet, poignant moments all tied up with a wonderful story, the most important aspect of all. With so many animation studios releasing these days, Pixar is the *only* one that is able to get it right, creating stories with heart that are able to connect with people of all ages, on every level. The tale of Finding Nemo is an enjoyable journey from start to finish and not once did I lose interest.I know this review is incredibly gushy and all, but I honestly cannot fault this film. I cannot wait to own it on DVD to see it again. With so much rubbish being released into cinemas, both animated and live-action, Finding Nemo is a gem. Adult, teenager, kid, whatever - do yourself a favor and go see it now.Long live Pixar.",9,1,2,30 August 2003
Brokeback Mountain," An amazing piece of cinema..
","I was fortunate enough to see the North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. That was two days ago, and this film just wont leave my mind. Not that I'm complaining because this is what good cinema is all about.Ennis and Jack, two cowboys who fall in love. As others have touched on, Brokeback Mountain is so much more than merely a 'gay cowboy movie'. It perfectly captures what true, unbridled love is all about and this love transcends any issues of sexuality or gender. 'Love is a force of nature'. Unfortunately for many people and indeed the protagonists of our story, society doesn't always view it that way. Kudos to Ang Lee who has not shied away from the material at all. This adaptation stays true to the original short story and the two lead actors fit the roles perfectly. Ledger and Gyllenhaal give incredibly strong performances but the supporting cast shouldn't be overlooked either, particularly a somewhat unrecognizable Michelle Williams. Solid work all around and with Mr Ang Lee's vision they have created an amazing piece of cinema that should not be missed by anybody. Without giving anything away, you are going to be moved by this one.",9,661,975,12 September 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Have a bucket handy.
","Contrived, sentimental, sappy, terrible acting and plenty of cringe-inducing moments. It must be The Day After Tomorrow. Be sure to have a bucket within easy reach.
I was really looking forward to this film. After doing so much business at the box-office and with mainly average to positive reviews, it looked somewhat promising. But to describe this film in a single word? TURKEY! The only things this film has going for it are the visual spectaculars in the form of Jake Gyllenhaal and impressive CGI effects (except the truly pathetic CGI wolves). Beware. I wouldn't even say it's worth a rent. Just catch it on cable.",5,0,1,6 July 2004
Sleepy Hollow," Burton does it again...
","Burton is a master at creating films that ooze style and manage to envelope you in a completely different world.  He doesn't fail to please with Sleepy Hollow...However, there are a couple of things that bothered me with the film. Firstly, there is a lot to take in with Sleepy Hollow and I think it's a case of sensory overload, which does detract somewhat from the experience. The plot is quite complex and both times I have watched it, I haven't been able to follow it, let alone try to piece it all together.  Subconsciously I found myself paying more attention to the pretty pictures and score and not really taking in all the plot's twists and turns.  It's too difficult to do it all at the same time, especially with such a detailed and rich movie.   
Secondly the 'comedy' aspect didn't go down too well with me.  What was the movie trying to be?  Moody, serious, surreal, scary AND funny?  Ichabod's 'quirkiness' was fine, I just found certain parts that were put in for giggles, not giggle-worthy and more out of place.Don't let that put you off the film though.  Sleepy Hollow is quite good viewing, guaranteed to draw you into it's world and have you on the edge of your seat.",Null,0,1,9 June 2001
Silent Hill," Almost had it....!
","Video game to movie adaptation. Are those alarm bells I hear?Silent Hill introduces us to a rather disturbed little girl, Sharon, and her protective parents. Sharon has been sleepwalking and the final straw for her mother, Rose, comes after an encounter with a very high cliff top. So Rose does what any sensible, intelligent mother does and takes Sharon off to the town of Silent Hill - the name Sharon has been muttering in her nocturnal adventures. Being a horror movie, and with a name as creepy as Silent Hill, we're about to find out this is the place of nightmares.To get it over with, as a video game adaptation, Silent Hill somewhat bucks the trend and provides us with an entertaining couple of hours. Stunning visuals and production values make it very easy to watch and coupled with the score, it is easy to get lost in Silent Hill. But like a lot of video games (and lets face it, movies too), the storyline has enough holes to rival a sieve. Rose makes countless, illogical decisions and not enough is revealed to the audience as the film dawdles along. Finally about two thirds of the way in and approaching the climax, the film kicks into overdrive and a barrage of revelations are made - which is all well and good but with so much information to take in it all gets rather convoluted and confusing...I liked the film a lot but it's really a classic case of style over substance. If only they had paid half as much attention to fine tuning the story as they had with the imagery and attention to detail, Silent Hill would really be cream of the video game-to-movie crop.",6,1,3,13 August 2006
Final Destination 2," You will squirm in your seat..
","Oh yes you will.  To put it simply, this film is a series of one grisly death after the other, the next usually more gruesome than the one before. The word 'gratuitous' comes to mind...  The first one was something new - it even had some style to it.  This one throws that all out of the window - it's about nothing more than grossing out the audience and making them squirm in their seats.  It kinda redeems itself with the death sequences - the first one is particularly impressive. Final Destination 2 doesn't take itself too seriously - but then it doesn't descend into the depths of oh-so-stupid-self-mockery.  It kinda got that balance right.    Go...cringe...be grossed out!",Null,0,0,6 March 2003
Blade II," A worthy sequel..
","Slick, stylish, action-packed...these are just some of the words that come to mind when describing Blade II.  Oh, and incredibly gory.  If gratuitous blood-n-guts isn't your thing, I'd recommend you stay well away...As far as big-budget sequels go, Blade II isn't that bad a trip.  For the most part it retains the same basic feel that made the original Blade enjoyable, and this time the film is set in Prague and a decidedly European slash Gothic feel is evident, a very moody one at that.  Blade II kinda skimps on the story (as you'd expect), and is instead packed full of stylish action sequences, and lots of blood and guts.  There were a few moments where I was squirming in my seat at what was onscreen, so it's definitely not one for the faint of heart.  That said though, the story is a good effort, it's sufficient and you wont be bored.  I read a review describing Wesley Snipes as one big show-pony in this film, and I couldn't agree more. He does make a cool hero though, and I was actually feeling sorry for the bad guys cos he was just too good...Better than the first?  Not quite.  But a good sequel nonetheless.",Null,0,1,16 July 2002
Corpse Bride," What's that smell?
","No, I didn't like this film. I really wanted to. I was so looking forward to it. It looked wonderful. It stank.The Corpse Bride marks Burton's 2nd foray into the world of stop motion animation, a technique that produced the amazing Nightmare Before Christmas. A cult classic, if I may say so myself. One of my all time favorite movies.Johnny Depp plays the role of a bumbling fool (sound familiar?) in Victorian times, about to enter into an arranged marriage of social status and wealth. After a disastrous wedding rehearsal, Depp's Victor is stumbling through the forest where he unwittingly weds himself to the titular character of the film, the Corpse Bride (played by a sassy Helena Bonham Carter). Macabre, animated mayhem ensues...yadda yadda yadda.So what went wrong for the Bride? This film suffers from that fatal flaw that so many animated films these days fall victim to. The story, the characters, the heart, they all take a backseat to the whizz bang visuals on screen. Burton has no restraint as he dazzles us with breathtaking imagery that rival today's ubiquitous 3D fare for beauty and awe. The problem is, it gets old real fast. With no story to feast on, no characters to care about, it got boring. The chuckles and giggles that came from the predictable sight gags and puns petered out to silence halfway through.A classic case of all style and no substance. Slap in a number of forgettable musical numbers that merely seem to be an excuse to create even more on screen silliness and you have a bona-fide yawn fest.I know this all sounds harsh, but it was Burton himself who set the bar so high his first time around. View at your own risk.",5,8,34,16 September 2005
"Monsters, Inc."," Not to be missed.
","Pixar has such a great track record with their movies, and once again they don't fail to deliver with this film.The animation, as can be expected, is top-notch.  The story doesn't take long to kick into gear and it's not long before you find yourself enjoying the ride.  The voice acting, along with the subtlety of the animation, is what really brings the characters to life.  Boo was the cutest kid I have ever seen on screen, and she's not even real!Like Pixar's other films, Monster Inc. also has enough to keep both the little kids and the adults entertained.  Though not quite as hilarious as Toy Story 2, it has jokes a-plenty and will keep just about everyone entertained right from the start.Make sure you see it.",8,0,1,15 February 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," The trilogy that could have been..
","Like insane amounts of special effects, hordes of animated robots and big explosions make an awesome movie or something? Sometimes they can, and do. But this is the Matrix I'm talking about, not just any old mediocre, explosion-laden CGI mess of celluloid. Exactly what the Matrix has been reduced to in Revolutions. I expected so much more from Revolutions, and I guess that's what makes the conclusion to this trilogy so disappointing.I've no doubt it's going to totally kick butt at the box-office, but I think a lot of people are gonna feel mighty let down.",6,0,0,5 November 2003
Lilo & Stitch," Disney's back in da house.
","This is without doubt Disney's best in recent years.  I have nothing but praise for this film, and it finally seems that Disney is back on track. Whether or not they can keep it up remains to be seen, but Lilo and Stitch was worth every cent of admission and it will definitely be joining my DVD collection.The animation is beautifully done, though the animators aren't trying to dazzle your pants off - it was refreshing.  But what really stands out about this film is both the story and the cast of characters.  The story sucked me in right from the start and I was more than happy to go along for the ride. This is thanks mostly to the characters.  They're all memorable and endearing creations, and for most of the film you will be cracking up in your seat at the onscreen antics.  While this film is aimed at kids (hello, Disney), don't let that put you off as adults will be just as entertained. I was even surprised at a lot of the humor, it didn't seem so childish as you might expect.  That said, it's not all hilarity and comic capers, the film does tackle some deeper issues and at times it's touching.Two words.  See it.",9,2,3,1 October 2002
"I, Robot"," Enjoyable and forgettable.
","I, Robot is a largely forgettable summer sci-fi popcorn flick, but enjoyable nonetheless. Personally I was so entranced with all that was happening onscreen I found it a little hard to want to follow the story too closely and got a little lost in some places.Action and pretty effects this flick has in spades. Beautiful CG work and some very clever camera work make this film very pleasing to the eye. Decent acting from a not so witty Will Smith (who is certainly looking very buff in this outing) and his female no-name sidekick.There is better out there but you could also do much worse at the cineplex right now.",Null,0,0,4 August 2004
Spider-Man," Worthy of the hype...
","This is perhaps the only film I've ever seen that's lived up to the hype. Big kudos to Sam Raimi on such an excellent film, and the cast who did such a great job with the characters.I've never read the comics (I did watch the cartoon though!) so I don't know how well it has been translated to the big screen, but I thought the movie played exactly like I imagine the comic book would.  Big action scenes, colorful settings and just the right amount of humor.  The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, but then it doesn't totally go all out tongue-in-cheek.  Sam Raimi managed to balance it excellently.At times it seemed a little slow, and longer than it was, but that's really the only negative I can come up with.  Go see it, you wont be disappointed....definitely one to buy on DVD when it comes out too!",8,0,0,7 June 2002
Spirited Away," Beautiful movie
","In a few words...beautiful, memorable, magical and enchanting. 
Miyazaki has created an amazing world and he totally immerses the viewer within it using every available tool of the trade.  The animation, the story, the music, the characters, everything.  If I start to rave about it I wont stop.  If you have children, take them to see it.  If you're a child at heart, see it.  Even if you're of the mature, adult variety, see it! 
One of my new all-time favorites, and it will be in my DVD collection for sure.",Null,2,3,24 October 2002
Resident Evil," ..tries hard to be slick and stylish..
","When are those stupid Hollywood producers just gonna learn, videogames DO NOT translate to the big screen...very well!  It's been proven countless times, but they just don't get it...and here we have yet another one..That said, Resident Evil wasn't as big a stinker as some game-to-movie adaptions that I can recall (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, anyone?).  But there's still plenty to pick on...Resident Evil tries really hard to be slick and stylish (like Tomb Raider), but for the most part it falls flat on its face and fails miserably.  As one would probably expect, the story takes a backseat (hell, it's not even in the car), and gives way to some hardcore action, lotsa gore, zombies, a mysterious genetic research laboratory, a hella sexy chick in some wicked designer clothes who can sure kick butt, and one macho chick with some big 'tude...and a big gun.  That about sums it all up.Oh, and I wanna also say that the special effects absolutely sucked.It could have been better, it could have been worse. As far as videogame-movies go, Resident Evil didn't quite make the grade, in my books. If you're looking for substance (which I doubt you are, given that you are reading this review), look elsewhere.  But if you want all of the above, maybe you should check it out.",Null,0,0,30 April 2002
Moulin Rouge!," .......awesome.
","I'm so glad this film has received mostly positive reviews, but the negative reviews really leave me puzzled!  This movie was awesome and I have no idea what the nay-sayers are complaining about...Man where to start...throw all preconceptions about the film out the window when you sit down.  Everything you've heard about Moulin Rouge is true (most of it at least!), it's colorful, bold, bright and explosive.  The acting is awesome and while I'm no expert on the art, I think Kidman and McGregor pulled it off superbly and their singing was fantastic...who'd have thunk that they could sing as well?!  Kudos to the other actors as well, particularly Leguizamo and the guy who played the Duke.  The musical scenes are mind-blowing (particularly the finale) and the choreography and the dancers and..everything!  Awesome!  The soundtrack was great as well, which is why I went out and bought the CD today...I really urge you to see this movie.  When I walked out of the theater last night, my mind was pretty much spinning and not much had sunk in.  It's the sort of movie that really hits you when you wake up the next morning.  Don't listen to the people who seem to think any nail that sticks out and doesn't conform with movie-making convention has to be hammered down.  Moulin Rouge is indeed different.  It's amazingly different and bound to leave you with a big 'Wow' plastered on your mouth.",8,0,0,29 May 2001
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," The Chocolate Factory Delivers
","The remakes just keep on coming and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is no exception. But as is usually the case with Tim Burton at the helm, viewers are in for a treat.The production values on this flick must have been sky-high and the breath taking visuals are nothing less than what you would expect from Burton. They almost go so far as to steal the show, and kids will love marveling at the imaginary factory on screen and getting lost in the fantasy. For older viewers there doesn't seem to be a lot to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but glimpses of Willy Wonka's childhood lend some depth to the proceedings, culminating at the end with his confrontation of some childhood issues.My other gripes with the film were the musical numbers which came across as somewhat contrived, cheesy and unnecessary, if anything they could have been shortened to a minute at most. The new Oompa Loompas look very creepy indeed but that could just be me..!But regardless of any little story and musical gripes, you're simply going to be sucked into the fantasy of this film and it's a great ride.I've never been a huge fan of Johnny Depp but this film did it for me and he does an amazing job with Willy Wonka with a lot of subtle nuances and quirks and some great lines. I was also skeptical about newcomer Freddie Highcomer in the titular role but all my fears were blown away by this kid. He shows a lot of promise. Praise also has to go to Helena Bonham-Carter and Noah Taylor in supporting roles, they were great in the short time they were on screen.Highly recommended for kids and and the kids in all of us older folk.",8,2,3,27 November 2005
Saw," A solid effort for casual and hardcore fans alike
","I wanted to see this film from word-of-mouth alone, or rather the buzz I had seen about it on the internet. Glad to say I wasn't disappointed.A clever thriller/horror film that very much keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat with feelings of suspense, anxiety and fear. A stylish film, but as somebody else commented it does seem a little overdone in some areas. That would be the only flaw I could pick in this flick.Saw does have moments where you will squirm in your seat but it's because of what is being suggested on-screen more than anything else. I think that's the true mark of a good, effective horror film. There is a dose of blood 'n guts but not to the point of being gratuitous (unlike a recent remake in Texas).The story is disturbing, engrossing, entertaining, it has an original streak - pretty refreshing with all of the other crap masquerading as horror movies at the cinemas right now. I loved the twist at the end and it's wide open for a sequel (which according to IMDb.com is on the agenda). The acting was decent enough and definitely carries the film well. Elwes seemed a bit forced sometimes and newcomer Whannell had a bit of uneasiness about him, but all in all they and the supporting cast did a great job.A very solid effort and for casual and hardcore fans alike, you can't miss it.",8,0,1,31 January 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Dull, dull, dull.
","For me this film was the equivalent to a visual dose of Vallium, it almost put me to sleep. You know a movie is bad when you keep looking at your watch. Indeed, this is one of those films. One would think the novel is a perfect candidate for a summer blockbuster with its mix of religious controversy, conspiracy theories and romantic European settings but something got very lost in translation to the big screen. And coming from Ron Howard, of all people, that this film is such a big failure is somewhat puzzling.I think one of the biggest errors came down to the casting of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. He simply is not believable in this role and appears to be merely sleep walking his way through it. His acting seems to set the tone for the entire movie - droll and lifeless. Audrey Tatou's beauty, Ian McKellen's fine acting and Paul Bettany's albino menace are just not enough to overcome this tone that permeates the final product.Not all is bad. There is some very nice cinematography to be seen; the Louvre, Paris, the cathedrals all look stunning. I also thought the ending scene, Tom Hank's visit to the Louvre was wonderfully done and it really was the only time during the entire move that I actually felt something and was, dare I say it, moved. One star for the cinematography, and one each for Tatou, McKellen and Bettany.In the end, nothing I say will change anybody's mind from seeing this film! Having read the book you will feel absolutely compelled to see it (as I was) - just don't set your expectations very high at all. It may also be that those who haven't yet read the book are going to find much more enjoyment in the film, as was the case with my friend. Lucky them.",4,0,2,4 June 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A disappointing translation...
","Watching this movie was a mixed experience for me.  Having read the books, it was interesting to see how the film-makers realized the world of Harry Potter according to their own interpretations, and it was fun comparing these with my own.  There were things I liked, and disliked, and I'm just gonna tackle the major ones.For the most part, the film remains faithful to the book.  But I believe that maybe it was too faithful.  A lot of the time I felt like I was watching a mish-mash of sequences from the book (in..er...sequence), just acted out.  That's perhaps my biggest gripe, that and the story seemed to lack and fluidity or flow.  It's like the film-makers said 'Hey, everyone who's gonna see this has read the book anyway, who cares about character development or the story?  Let's just knock em out with lots of eye-candy'. Granted, I'm willing to wager that a huge majority of the audience has read the books, but I think the film-makers relied on this aspect way too much. Our knowledge of the characters, their relationships and everything else was taken as a given.  My second gripe was with the three main actors.  You know, I've never really known what you could define as a 'chemistry' between actors, but I think I do now.  The three who played Ron, Harry and Hermione had none.  Nada.  Zip. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) seemed to lack severely in the enthusiasm department.  Where did they find this kid?  The other two actors (for Hermione and Ron) weren't nearly as bad, but I just couldn't imagine the three personalities we were presented with on screen, as being friends. 
What I liked about the film...?  Well the production values were stupidly high, and this is evident in just about every single scene (I'm not complaining!).  It's 150 minutes of pure eye-candy.  That's probably the only redeeming feature of the film, but we all know that this doth not maketh a good movie.  I may sound a little sour about the whole experience (and like one severely disappointed, frothing-at-the-mouth, psychotic Harry Potter fan...seriously, I'm not), but it wasn't completely terrible.  Maybe they'll do something about the cut-n-paste recipe for the next film, and the three child actors will mature a little more...and stuff.  We'll see!",Null,0,0,28 May 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," An experience.

The Emperor's New Groove," Nicely surprised...
","The Emperor's New Groove sees Disney take a very large step away from the tired Hollywood-musical formula.  Upon hearing this I was quite eager to see what the studio had up their sleeves, and I'm happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised.  This film is an all-out comedy and it doesn't fail to provide.  There were some moments that didn't draw much of a giggle and it was somewhat slow to start off with, but by the film's climax the laughs are coming pretty hard and fast.Also breaking with tradition, there is nothing ground-breaking or state-of-the-art with the animation.  That's not to say that the animation is bad!  It's the standard Disney work, beautiful and subtle, just no CG eye-candy trying to make up for a lack-lustre story.The background music fits in well but there are no show-stopping musical scenes.  A welcome change.  The tunes are nothing memorable which isn't necessarily a bad thing either.  As for the characters, Yzma and Kronk in my opinion, steal the show!  There are some hilarious scenes between these two.  I loved Yzma right from the start, and Kronk really does grow on you.  I'm not a big fan of David Spade (or his sitcom 'Just Shoot Me') and to be honest I walked in feeling a little skeptical about him, but he did a really good job in the role of Kuzco.  Thumbs up to John Goodman as Pacha as well.I can really only sum this film up as 'different'.  But different in a very good way.  The Emperor's New Groove is not about the fancy-schmancy animation or the music or the big-name voice actors.  It's about the story, and a good one at that.  After Tarzan I was beginning to think that Disney had really lost the plot for good but it seems as though they could be back on track, breaking some new ground as well.  As with all Disney animated flicks, this is one aimed at the kiddies but it seems as though the humor has matured just a bit (seems like the current trend), so young people and adults are bound to get a few laughs.  Well worth the admission price, definitely worth a rental.",Null,0,1,28 April 2001
Bruce Almighty," The formulaic Carrey vehicle.
","Typical Carrey fare - he gets to pull faces, contort his body in numerous ways and make bizarre noises.  It provides an enjoyable hour-and-forty minutes worth of viewing with some great laughs (ironically the star didn't get any from me), although it does seem to 'run out of puff' toward the end.  This is pretty much an 'everyone' kind of film.  Definitely recommended for the Carrey buffs but even just the every-movie person.  Worth catching on the big screen.",7,0,2,26 June 2003

Go see it - you wont be disappointed.  Bring on X3!",9,0,0,1 May 2003
Final Destination," ...a nice change from the usual slice-em-dice-em teen-slasher formula..
","A pretty decent horror flick, Final Destination presented an interesting story and was a nice change from the usual slice-em-dice-em teen-slasher formula.  I thought the use of 'Death' as the unseen killer was particularly effective, and the movie manages to keep it's presence subtle rather than going all out with special effects and a physical portrayal.The last time I saw Devon Sawa was in Casper and he sure has grown up.  I thought the acting in general was pretty average but hey it's a horror flick, we're not after Oscar-worthy performances here. 
The story as I said, was quite interesting and definitely gets you thinking. Some of the deaths were pretty disturbing and I was surprised to find myself squirming in my seat!  The visuals were standard fare, nothing to rave about.All in all, if you're a fan of the teen-slasher flick genre, you're bound to like Final Destination.

","We'll be seeing Shrek 3 within the next couple of years and I'm sure a Shrek 4 is in the pipeline already. DreamWorks must know it can't milk the Shrek franchise forever and if it was hoping SharkTale could prove a worthy successor, they are sadly mistaken.I believe this film was originally titled SharkSlayer (before becoming the unimaginatively titled SharkTale), and I bet DreamWorks was hoping it would be their NEMO Slayer. Too bad, try again. I'm sorry but comparisons are inevitable between two completely CGI films set in a vast watery expanse. SharkTale is all flash, pretty colors and big name actors with an endless drivel of pop- culture references. Pretty on the surface, completely lacking underneath. Will Smith's over the top, contrived schtick became irritating after the first couple of minutes and Black, De Niro, Zellweger and Jolie are nothing but big name drawcards.The 'weird-looking humanized fish-people' kept making me think I was watching some alien film. It was only because of the bubbles and seaweed and sand that I was reminded this was set under the ocean. This film is for the kids, and anybody who gets a kick out of pop-culture jokes and flashy CG visuals. For something meatier, with heart and originality, go elsewhere.DreamWorks had better get a new recipe because this one was tired and stale six months ago. Get some better stories. Get some funnier jokes. Get some originality. For now and the foreseeable future, the computer animation crown is safe and sound in Pixar's hands.",3,2,6,25 October 2004
The Island," Underrated!
","I found The Island to be highly enjoyable - a great Summer blockbuster that isn't quite mindless. It raises a number of very interesting questions...Plenty of eye candy in every form, the two leads, the scenery, explosions, action sequences, the cinematography, everything you would expect from Michael Bay and Co. The pacing to begin with is somewhat slow as the premise is set up (though disappointingly the trailers give it all away), but once it launches into the first action sequence it doesn't let up for some time. Yes the story has a number of plot holes but you can easily overlook them and get swept away in the fun. I've never seen Johansson on film until now and WOW, now I know what all the fuss is about. Her and McGregor display enough chemistry to make their relationship believable but only just. I'm sure this will only propel them onto bigger and better things.My one and only gripe was with the ending scene complete with cheesy choral accompaniment - blech! Maybe Bay just couldn't help himself. I suppose no film is perfect..7 out of 10, solid, fun entertainment, what more can you ask for?",7,325,449,3 August 2005
