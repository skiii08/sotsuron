Marie Antoinette," Nice try but no sigar
","Marie Antoinette was a nice try to give a broad audience an idea on how history was.. Too bad Marie Antoinette failed in doing so. A+ on decors and costumes, but lacks the historical story. Kirsten Dunst failes to prover herself as a 14y old and the mixes of American, English and the children one time speaking french and the other time English confuses the audience and gives people a unhealthy feeling.But if you like Costume movies without respect for a truthfull story, then this might be the best movie you'll ever see.i on the other hand missed the storyline, the most important things in M.A.'s life have been carelessly left out. Needless to say this movie got a 3/10 which is still very kind.",3,17,34,5 June 2006
