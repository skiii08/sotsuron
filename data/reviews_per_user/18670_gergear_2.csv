Resident Evil: Afterlife," Terrible, Terrible, Terrible! And one more time Awful
","If there is an afterlife, and I come back as a snail it will be significantly better than this!I can honestly say with my hand securely fixed over my shell that this is possibly one of the worst movies ever made. Don't get me wrong there are some terrible movies out there, but this was such a waste of money, time and effort. The story is utterly pathetic, there's no continuity from scene to scene leaving the viewers completely lost. It tries to use the sophistication of the matrix with an awful matrix rip-off style bady. Hello??? How many times will the Matrix be copied. Bad guys with sun glasses have been done to death. The matrix is fantastic but with the constant advances of modern movie making it's actually starting to look slightly dated, why copy it again? There's even a clever pun on prison break in this movie with the introduction of Wentworth Miller, Oh! How ironic because he's locked up inside a cage, inside a prison and this time he can't escape. Guys you just kill me with this cr@p. Surely a monkey with half a brain can write a better story than this. I have never walked out of the cinema and I've been forced to watch some shockers in my time (random dates / girly flicks) but after 10 mins, yes! 10 mins I shuffled in my seat and really considered leaving. I love sci-fi, action films, any good film! I must ask why the money is still being provided to make these productions and why after four movies they still can't find a good writer and director. All in all, don't see this movie, don't fund it! Don't watch, don't even download it! And hopefully they will stop making them. I actually walked out of this movie and said to my wife, 'Baby, lets not come to the cinema for a while now' I think I need some time away; I daren't now even buy a bag of popcorn. I await Scott pilgrim which has yet to be released here in Thailand. Scott, please come save my world of cinema now!",1,21,55,9 September 2010
Super 8," Super 8.....super... hmmm just OK!
","I really wanted to love this movie. Having grown up in the 80's blessed with so many classic Spielberg movies the thought him making one with JJ Abrahams was tantalizing. Unfortunately, it seems that by working together they have simply produced a compilation of all there best ideas which when put together into an entire movie simply don't wash. There were so many ideas taken from past Spielberg movies, Jaws, Close encounters, ET just to name a few. Then into to the mix comes JJ with his Lost / Cloverfield (which I love) mystery monster adult story. The result is a continued battle between a touching, funny, kids Spielberg movie with a confusing, alien monster that kills soldiers and has unbelievable power which as the story unfolds becomes absurd as to how the Army ever had control of it in the first place. This simply did not at up at all! To keep it simple these two movie styles should be kept separate. When they are combined together there is not enough of either to satisfy. Through the majority of the movie I just sat there thinking I've seen this before, I know what's going to happen next, it was better in the eighties. Cloverfield was far better, The Goonies was a classic, ET was a classic, Close Encounters was a classic, Jaws was a classic. This unfortunately was not!",6,47,81,14 June 2011
