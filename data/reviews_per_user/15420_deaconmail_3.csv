Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat was a bore
","It was amateurish and immature - more like a high school project than an actual movie. I laugh louder at your average Budweiser commercial than I laughed at 60 minutes of Borat. It was so unfunny and bad that I just got tired of it and took out the DVD - just stopped. I do not know if it was top 10 worst movie material, but it was close.Combine that with the fact that my expectations were high, since everyone was raving about how hilarious it was - I heard many people saying things like 'funniest movie of all time'. To me, it was so unfunny, I do not even understand how someone could think it was funny. Possibly, I laughed out loud once, and chuckled a couple times, but mostly, I just sat there waiting for it to get funny instead of stupid.Again, for some reason, people vote for a 'trendy' movie that was really, really bad.",1,43,84,19 March 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Boredom
","This was very much a 'nothing' movie. Too little plot, too little real acting, too little charm, too little to hold any interest. The movie was not funny. There were no laughs, though maybe a small chuckle - when the funniest moment in the movie is when the door falls off the bus, it is sad. Which is more what this movies was about and what the movie was like. It was sad. If the movie had any message, it was that dreams get squished and there isn't anything you can do about it besides move on. In the movie, everyone's dream is destroyed, and they show no end in site, no remedy, no better future for anyone. Overall, the movie was tedious. It is hard to understand how anyone would like this movie at all, much less really think it was even good. Apologies to 'trendy' people who want to vote FOR this movie, but it really was bad.",1,23,48,19 March 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Spotless what?
","Good god was this a boring, pointless movie.It made sense until the last 10 minutes, then an ending came out of nowhere. Acting was dull and overall emotionless - except for the ham Carrey who, of course, overacted his heart out.Camera shots were unfocused and too fast.Overall, the movie is a boring mess. I sincerely regret watching this movie - it was a rental mistake.I would put it on my BOTTOM 20 - no questions asked. If you are faced with the opportunity to see this movie, RUN AWAY!",1,13,33,4 January 2005
