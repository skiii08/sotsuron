Black Swan," Wow, the best film I've seen in awhile
","I really hadn't heard of all the hype surrounding this movie, but I completely left the theater in awe. I was a little confused when I saw Mila Kunis in this movie, but she actually surprised me and gave a good performance.Of course, Natalie Portman was excellent, as usual, portraying a 'good' and 'bad' side. Although, the irony of this movie is I really do not believe there were good and bad characters in this movie.The movie starts out showing Natalie Portman's dedication to ballet, and her overbearing and overprotective mother constantly pushing her. By the end of the movie, her mother honestly scared me...I wasn't sure if she was crazy, bi-polar, etc, but there was something wrong with her. I did not know where the movie was going until about half way through when Natalie was walking down an alley and saw a girl who resembled her exactly...this is when I got goosebumps. From this point on, the movie was so interesting and intriguing, I was sitting on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what would happen next.There are so many things I could go into with this movie, but I will leave it at..GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Please. It is completely worth your time, because it has a little bit of everything. Some romance, some lust, some dancing, some thrills, and even some legitimate scary/disturbing scenes. There is so much that goes on in this movie, and the ending leaves it up for your own interpretation. It was literally a masterpiece, I absolutely loved it.",10,1,3,9 January 2011
