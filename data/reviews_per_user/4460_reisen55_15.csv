Blade Runner 2049," Death of a thousand cuts
","There should be an award for the Todd Ramsey School of film editing. Remember him? If you do not, venture back before the original 'good' BladeRunner to the cold winter of 1979 when all SciFi fans trotted into theatres to see STAR TREK: THE MOTION(less) PICTURE. Remember the editing? What there was of it. Well, just lasted an hour and 40 into this thing, an emotionless creature of a film. Did not even get to see Harrison Ford. Other reviewers have said ' slow ' and that would be a good thing. THIS film is not slow, it died ages ago and is trying to be an alive thing. Scenes are soooooooooo long and drawn out they starve the mind for creativity. Frank Capra once said the cardinal sin of making a movie is to be BORING and the old master was spot on. BORING and I walked out so consider this a partial review. If you can stand it to see Harrison Ford - my blessings unto you.Acting? The ONLY interesting performance that I saw was Robin Wright and that just because I am a Claire Underwood fan.Story? If you see plot points of significance 30 minutes BEFORE they happen, then you have a bad story. And the editing, see above.Music? Only occasionally a hint of the old, wonderful 1982 score. Mostly the music is noise. Other reviews here have said they have mastered the sudden LOUD sound to wake the viewer up. WHY WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT if the film was not so freaking SLOW!!!!! I loved the film noir effect of the first film and it's variations over the years till Ridley Scott got the 2007 version he liked. I love films in general and even find good stuff in the 1979 Star Trek of a kind.There is no joy in this film, no emotion, no urgency, no nothing. Warner Bros. blew $185 million (!!!) on a memory from 1982 and it is far from that. Do not wait for it on DVD either - why waste 2 Hour 44 Min of a nice evening. Find a good restaurant for a good dinner instead.They did not even have fireballs exploding over the Los Angeles of the future!!! Can I report something good? No. Honestly, cannot do so. At least they did not kill a dog.",2,22,48,8 October 2017
Captain Marvel," Forget our troubles fun
","Many years ago, when I was job hunting, I saw the third Indiana Jones to take my mind of a ton of worries and for 2 hours had a great time. Same with this film - enjoy it, it's fun and not heavy at all. So some thoughts.....Not 'great' like Ragnarok or mindless fun like Deadpool - this is nothing than a noted popcorn-entertainment film with blood ties to the MCU as it should be.There are a ton of small homage bits to other films if you know what to look for. The original TRON and INDEPENDENCE DAY among them. Know your stuff. I spotted a few more along the way. Star Trek - Nemesis if you think about it.Brie Larson is very good as is Jackson and so is the infamous Cat who steals the movie.There is one huge plot contradiction that stands out like sore thumb. True MCU fans will get it.Intro tribute to Stan Lee is very very effective and well done indeed. Final two bits are excellent - the second one hilarious to anyone who has had a cat.So, grab some popcorn and sit back to enjoy a well told story. Not perfect (even Citizen Kane has flaws) but a fine, fun trip around a few galaxies and Earth as well.",9,0,8,10 March 2019
The Irishman," When great directors and actors grow old
","2 Hours and 51 minutes. Fact as Clouseau used to say. Cars spectacularly blowing up. Fact. (They Pyro guys are better now). Aging actors. Fact. No spoilers necessary because you have seen this movie before when it was called GOODFELLAS and a better film it was back then. CASINO bothered me by having too much naration. The camera is amazingly static. Shots extend way way too long and if I saw that high shot of the street corner again and again ... Scorsese went to sleep seemingly. Please save your life and see STAR WA.... no, that is a mess too. You will have a more exciting time in the back yard watching a squirrel hunting for food.",4,2,5,29 December 2019
Suicide Squad," Guilty Pleasures
","Now about a month down the road from watching, it strikes me that SQ is a far better variation on the standard CGI-based superhero film that Marvel and DC have come to own. When I watched CaptAmer-CivWar (to use shorthand) it was going to be another gigantic CGI fight after another and when Ironman-Cap go at it, well neither is going to be killed. More of the same. So the concept of taking the bad people and putting them to work is a very good idea. It is impossible to improve on Heath's wonderful JOKER of course, and Leto needs more time to put humor into his character. But the plot and action stayed to a local scene (not worldwide massive huge destruction as in X-Men Apoc) so that was more believable too. I do fear though that the CGI-Superhero vein has been mined to pieces by now. Nothing new most of the time. Which is why this particular film is good because it is DIFFERENT.Remember the magic of SUPERMAN in 1978? Batman in 1989? We are far gone from those two films now. Enjoy them too when the world was primitive and effects were real and we had a really good Lex Luthor and Joker.",7,1,4,7 September 2016
Doctor Strange," Perfect Entertainment - Enjoy something strange.
","The fabled MCU world is an interesting creation for cinema, and I think the only thing we have it compare to are the Bond films for consistency. Star Trek and Wars are so fragmented now that once around the curve from one series or film to the next, the roads tends to fade away. Marvel, wisely, connects at least this part of the universe together quite well, binding all the titles into one plot. (Fox owns the X-Men of course and the two studios have never been able to craft a co-agreement. They should, that film would be epic, probably 3 hours plus too). So here we have a new entry that opens up new worlds, literally, of reality and being. No specifics here and acting kudos go to one and all. The film is tight and constantly entertaining, action here and humor there. Some of the finest jokes are the smallest of them. It is amazing the laugh you can get out of a collar. Visuals are, of course, the world of computers year again, but so well executed that one is amazed at the complexity of the software behind these fellows burning the midnight oil. There should be a credit for gallons of coffee consumed. This is a beautiful film. Some shots are paintings and more are Escher prints. Small stuff - the new Marvel logo is very impressive, two scenes at the end are keepers and as one reviewer noted, the quiet conversion in the snow at night is memorable. Have a fine evening at the movies my friends. Dr. Strange will return. (Oh, was that Bond?)",9,1,4,12 November 2016
Dunkirk," Virtual Experience of war, chaos, horror and hope
","From a different viewpoint as this author walked down 101 floors of the South Tower on September 11. Worked for Aon and came away with not PTSD or dust-health problems (I was far uptown when the towers came down). So as I sat watching Dunkirk, the cummulative effect was to virtually relive aspects of THAT day for me. It's impossible to describe horror, fear and what it was like to BE there, or BE at Dunkirk. Many films and books (fondly MRS. MINIVER was the first). Or the heroic dogfights of BATTLE OF Britain. This one - far different. I came out of the theater feeling that I had just been through not only Dunkirk but 9-11 as well. It is THAT effective. The lack of dialogue for a good part of the film draws the viewer INTO the story as a real participant. YOU'RE THERE. Spielberg did it a few times such as the 20 minute Omaha Beach segment of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but even that film became just a more intense version of the standard war film.Be prepared to have your life changed by this one. It's that damn good.",10,166,322,22 July 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Walked of out it.
","Frank Capra had a golden rule - a movie can be many things but the number one sin is boring. Endgame - wanted to like it, spent money to like it, and .... boring. long, talkative and not worth the time. 2 hours would be fine, stretched to 3. Comedy was good mostly but not the padding. Long long intro shots of this and that. It finally hit the gold standard of DC. It took itself way way too seriously. So I am disappointed and sad. About right up there with Star Trek - The Motion Picture for boring. I don't like writing this, but ....... boring.",2,80,147,27 April 2019
Logan," LOGAN did not do it for me
","This was a disappointment for me and my wife and I walked out of it half way through, worse when you WANT to like a film as the entire X-Men franchise and the other half, owned by Marvel, as they all comprise good, solid entertainment. Funniest thing was the first five min and then downhill from there. This is a mean, nasty film, not one character is likable and just something far from taking mind away from problems on a weekend. I know many here think this is the CITIZEN KANE of action - X - superhero films and I suppose I could see ..... nope, cannot see that viewpoint. The X-Men series dies a bad death for me. Hell, the Fox logo in the beginning did not even highlight the X for a moment or two.Wasted my money totally. Going to a bar for a solid drink.",2,6,17,12 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Comparisons between 1 and 2
","The Avengers films are always interesting, the first one being the epitome of the Superhero genre. It was and still is perfect, and interesting to compare the Marvel films entirely (not matter which studio) to the darker DC Universe of Batman (Nolan) and the Superman reboots. Probably only Superman 1 and 2 compare to the Marvel films for mind bending fun. The various Marvel sub-genres, Thor, Ironman, Captain America, are all expertly produced and mounted entertainment, solid and well crafted. But Ultron is, well, different. Watched it last night and after the 1st viewing in Imax 3D - essential - I was struck by the length of the film and the mindless fighting scenes. The lovely Safe House sequence dead center is a rest from the chaos surrounding the fights with Ultron and just about everybody else. Film editing is an art, not a science, but I could have cut perhaps 20 minutes out easily by trimming down the endless battle sequences. After a while, SOMEBODY has to get hurt and the Avengers get hurt soooooo rarely. Natasha is human through and through - never a scratch. Tony Stark out of armor is just a human too. Never really hurt. And yet the chaos begs incredulity. Cutting it back would make it more believable.And yes, it is still a boatload of fun.",7,1,5,31 May 2015
Joker," TOTAL WASTE OF TIME
","'If everyone in a room is thinking all the same, someone is not thinking.' George S.Patton. Last night I watched dear Heath run his dance as Joker and wonderment of it all - how damn good he was. So tonight I walked into a brick wall. EVERYONE says magnificent. Better than CITIZEN KANE and such tripe. Me? Bored, after 20 min of just bleak - nothing positive. I am moving right now and that is enough stress so I wanted entertainment - and WHOA was this one off base. Walked out after 20 min and I don't care a damn what happened to Joker. Penguin would be more interesting by a yard mile. I am sorry folks - disagree with all of you. Piece of junk.",3,13,33,20 October 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," Glorious Mess of a Movie
","It looks so good. Really, the feel of 1950s Hollywood has never been better, the photography is first rate with a stellar cast directed by the popular and very much held in esteem COEN BROTHERS. Trailer made it look like an fun Frank Capra kind of film. And when we walked out of it, given all the above, we missed something. A movie. There is none here. It is a great job made by talented people aplenty. It wants to be that fun film but never finds the movie. A few jokes. Not enough. Quirky fun characters, but not weird enough. Sublots aplenty, but they never run together and never are resolved. Good acting that goes nowhere. This fine film is just a bunch of dead end streets that are way too short with really interesting stuff on the side of the road but no intersection.Neil Simon was given script advice once that all the characters have to meet in the play AT LEAST ONCE. Here, none meet at all. They have the subplot and that is it. Ending was weak too. Meh.",5,184,278,7 February 2016
12 Strong," No review here but an opinion
","I cannot watch this film and for less obvious reasons - for I am a survivor of the South Tower. Worked for Aon and walked down from the 101st floor that morning. Certain films, events, take me back to The Towers and this would be a hard one to watch, same as Flight 93 was. Other films as less impactful to me and some, like THE WALK, mean nothing. I sense here, though, that a viewing would be followed by more than a few stiff drinks. So for those of us who were THERE that day ..... salute the film but have to say been there, and did that in a profound way. BTW Aon lost 176 people that morning 19 of which I knew personally.",8,0,9,27 January 2018
Midway," Excellent solid history told with dynamic emotion
","Student of history here and one who is familiar with much World War II, having built the Nichimo 1:200 Yamato (for the second time) last year. The books, Lord and Prange, are the Bibles of the battle and this film took pages and turned to screen intact and with respect. Harrelson was amazingly good as Nimitz too, did not think he had it in him. The rest of the cast - some well known, Quaid and Eckhart, and others new worked excellently ..... and the Japanese view was square solid too. Special Effects , CGI of course - were on par with the best though the Japanese films THE ETERNAL ZERO and THE ADMIRAL are just as good. Recommend these two films for a solid trio. We do not go back to the emotional slop of PEARL HARBOR or the accurate and very very dull TORA of so many years ago. But the one rare film where people CLAP at the end of it and sometimes you want cheer. Waves the flag without politics. A time and people to be proud of and render honor to. This film does precisely that.",9,4,5,13 November 2019
Spectre," On Bond(s)
","Spectre last night, and it was wonderful to see a full theatre. People go to see Bond because it is one of those life-root events. We do not get these films but every 2 or 3 years, and god bless Barbara Brocoli and Michael G. Wilson for carrying on the family tradition. Lost somewhere in all the Bond mania are those first novels by Ian Fleming and I strongly urge anyone with a passing interest, particularly this film, to go back to those books, Thunderball to start Spectre per se. Also urge the documentary, The Unknown Story of James Bond ... if memory serves. Long? Yes, we caught an 8:15 show and after god knows how many coming attractions, got out at 10:50 pm. About 20 min could be easily cut and you would not miss a thing. Satisfying? Very much so. Worth the wait? We all wait for Bond, just enjoy the homage throughout to the past Bond films and villains too.",8,5,15,8 November 2015
Draft Day," Surprising and quite good
","Sports films always seem to revolve around THE GAME or BUILDING THE TEAM FROM NOTHING or a baseball field in a cornfield in Iowa. Well, this one is different, a behind the scenes look into how the NFL teams manage the draft day picks, an unknown subject to almost anyone. Which makes it interesting to start with. True, plot could be better in some ways, like Costner has to come through, he has to win his love, etc. These are the givens in almost any film. Put these things aside and you find a well crafted, thoughtful film about ego and pressure, severe at times. It shows you what a lonely job life at the top can be. Cast is 1st rate save the mother who can wear on your nerves, as she is supposed to. Ah well for that. Costner plays, well, Costner and that is always time around a good friend. The direction is crisp and the scene cuts and swipes are brilliant, a fine way to advance the action or non-action in this case. An aspect of a game we rarely see. Recommend. Gave it an 8 just because I knew nothing about Draft Day inner-workings and it was an educational film as well.",8,0,2,8 June 2015
