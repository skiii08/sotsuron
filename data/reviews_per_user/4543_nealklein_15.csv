Minority Report," True science fiction
","True science fiction, the stuff of legend and the golden age, should provoke the mind and imagination. While this movie has Spielberg written all over it, it is truly thought provoking and masterful in its concept, art design, production values, subtle undertones, and overall impact. This is a film that should be seen, because it is not mere storytelling with a futuristic backdrop. No, this is a 'what if' story based on some disturbing and very real trends in our culture.With 'A.I.', this movie reaffirms Spielberg's innate understanding of the genre. Anyone can make a sci-fi set film. Spielberg goes the extra step, like the master sci-fi writers of the past, to get you to think about what you just watched.",8,0,0,25 December 2002
We Were Soldiers," Wonderful story, but badly directed
","If you ever want to compare and contrast two movies of similar content for differences in direction, watch 'We Were Soldiers' and 'Black Hawk Down'. Randall Wallace is so out of his depth in trying to convey dimension and depth to both the story and the characters that it's often painful to watch. The cliched and stereotypical scenes in the movie scream of amateurish direction. (Two scenes in particular: the wives' get-together with the 'Whites Only' reference to the laundromat, and the 'Tell my wife I love her' line so badly delivered that I laughed in spite of myself.)Keep in mind: I love war movies. I do not love them for their action. I don't even love them for the strategy and intelligence depicted in the arena of conflict. I love them because, when they're done correctly, these films show us the sacrifice and unreasonable commitment soldiers bring to the aforementioned arena. I genuinely feel for the soldiers when I see just what they are subjected to in combat. 'Black Hawk Down' left me wanting to know more about the brave rangers. 'Patton' left me wanting to learn more about the courage of General Patton's army. 'We Were Soldiers' almost didn't do that because of inept directing. Randall Wallace needs to hone his craft before he takes on such projects.See WWS, but see BHD first.",6,0,2,22 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A letdown, but a dazzling one
","(SPOILERS below for those of you that, unlikely as that may be, have never seen this film)As a high school senior, I skipped school on Wednesday May 25, 1983 to see the first non-preview showing of RotJ with 20 of my fellow classmates. We took up an entire row of the theater with the only 70 mm print with THX sound, no less! What an event. We had waited three years, speculating and reading anything that might give a hint at how the cliffhanger of 'The Empire Strikes Back' would be concluded. And here we were in rapt anticipation.When the credits started to roll two hours later, we were happy. We had finally seen it! What a film! What fun! What action! The special effects! What a ...And then, as we actually thought about it, we realized that we had just seen a very average film. The acting was far worse than in the previous two films. The story was poorly mapped out and the humor badly timed throughout. Leia was hardly the strong and determined heroine, and Han was *stupid*. They were all caricatures of the people we grew to care about.
I decided to see it again. I mean, was it really that bad? Yes, it actually was. I was embarrassed to talk about the film, it was so bad. And there was a political correctness to the story that annoyed me beyond words. For example, the Millenium Falcon should have been destroyed. One of the main cast probably should have died (besides Vader). The evil characters could have stood to be less one-dimensional. But Lucas was pandering to the audience and the marketers. Twenty minutes of the movie was an elaborate Muppet show.And then, there were the Ewoks ...Question: How do you kill the tension of the danger you and your entire rebellion is constantly in? Answer: Just add Ewoks.I personally had no problem with them as a race or as characters. They were quite clever. But they diminished the tension factor in the *ENTIRE STORY* by a factor of 10. Watch the movie again and notice how the movie goes from a rapid action film to an extraterrestrial 'Wild Kingdom' when they meet the Ewoks. In the words of Mr. Cranky, 'UGH!'When this film came out as a special edition release, I elected to go out and miss it. I saw the other two, but not this inferior sequel. And I'm glad I did.",6,3,6,23 October 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," More to say about a bad film
","While it might not be cricket to write more than one review for a film on imdb.com, AOTC necessitates it simply because the film is supposedly representative of one of the most well-known icons of modern Western mythology and storytelling. Star Wars is established in the minds of people worldwide, young and old, to the extent that there has even been a push to create an official religion called 'Jedi'. So AOTC has a lot to live up to. To all of those who say that AOTC and TPM are just movies, I have to state that it would be nice if that truly was the case. But such an effort has been made by many to integrate Star Wars into our thinking that one must expect at least a better story than something from the makers of TV movies of the week.Some reviewers claim that AOTC is hurt by bad acting. I disagree. Take a look at the other works of the main and secondary actors. Natalie Portman does Chekhov plays with Kevin Kline, for heaven's sake! You do *not* get asked to perform in such plays if you cannot act. Hayden Christensen was extraordinary in 'Life As a House' so please do not confuse his performance in AOTC with bad acting. That's what logicians call a specious syllogism.Some reviewers slavishly praise Lucas for even making the films. I disagree. George Lucas knew going into this project that he had a choice in making the prequels. He could make a trilogy with mass appeal, or he could make a trilogy that *he* would want to see. Or he could try extra hard and give the trilogy a depth and dramatic power that would surpass the first trilogy's legacy. Of course, to do that would require making *HARD* decisions like personally deciding what he could or could not do well. And George Lucas is not a student filmmaker needing the support of Coppola anymore. He literally has *hundreds* of millions of dollars and guaranteed financial success behind him.Some people see Star Wars as entirely belonging to George Lucas and they even thank the stars that George is not beholden to Hollywood blowhards too famous for diluting or meddling in the creative efforts of visionaries. Well, kiddies, do not forget, please, that the other extreme is just as bad: a film made by someone too famous and worshipped to be beholden to anyone but yes-men and sycophants.Some reviews mention the child actors in TPM and AOTC and categorically condemn them from having any part in successful and well-made movies. Does that logic apply to 'The Sixth Sense' or 'Poltergeist' or 'Harry Potter' or half the films directed by Steven Spielberg? Or might it be the fault of the DIRECTOR??? Does Jake Lloyd deserve that much blame for TPM and its failures? Is that realistic, or are the critics looking for a scapegoat other than ... the DIRECTOR???These are the reasons AOTC is going to get judged more harshly by the fans and critics who know that it could have, SHOULD have been a better film than it is. This is a film franchise that has EVERYTHING going for it, so it should evolve and unfold at least to the same standards as the original trilogy. But this is George Lucas we're talking about here, a man who had to have Greedo shoot Han *first* in (Star Wars: Special Edition) or change Luke's line to R2-D2 in ESB from, 'You're lucky you don't taste very good,' to 'You're lucky you got out of there.' (Think about how much time and money was spent just to make these changes in the Special Editions before you argue creative license on George Lucas' part.) This is the decision of the director, who seems now decidedly politically correct and without any edge. Movies about war need to be made by a director who has *some* kind of edge.If it was just all that, I would say that Lucas has no business directing his films as he clearly does not appear to handle all the nuances of key scenes. Lucas is just plain missing the point of directing and we, the audience, lose. But he also does not do something a writer and producer is *obligated* to do (by his/her profession) and that is scrupulously and intelligently maintaining story continuity and a logical consistency to the storyline. George does not do this in either Star Wars prequel, and again, the audience suffers.Some will *then* argue that AOTC is a setup for Episode III, so it can be forgiven some atrociously laid out exposition. Actually, good writing makes a single episode in an ongoing story stand on its own merits. ESB has a horrible cliffhanger and still managed to stand on its own or people would *have* to watch ESB back-to-back with ROTJ every time they saw it. How many reading this who have seen ESB had to watch ROTJ to understand ESB? It is for this reason that TPM and AOTC are inferior films because they are written like books in a juvenile series, and not like integrated but stand-alone movies. It is why they get top heavy in exposition and confuse some of the audience. Put another way, it's bad storytelling.'Oh, come on!' I hear you say, 'It's 'Star Wars,' not the Bible! It's only a movie!!' Well, it is NOW. Twenty-five plus years ago, 'Star Wars' broke ground and set standards for motion picture action films not done since 'The Adventures of Robin Hood,' and 'The Empire Strikes Back' raised the bar both technically and from the viewpoint of really advancing a saga. And the entire series was about adding a believable spiritual ingredient to a traditionally two dimensional genre. Modern myths do NOT happen every day! But now, to quote Mel Brooks, it's all about 'moychendizing'! *sigh*",4,0,0,12 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," What can I say that has not already been said?
","I wrote a review for this movie and was disappointed to find that the review and vote completely vanished into the ether. So after reading some brilliantly written commentary, I realized that I could add little to the body of opinions about the film.The bottom line is that the move truly is mediocre and barely credible to me. I am amazed at the sheer quantity of hype-fed fans who lowered their standards in order to tolerate the sad flaws that detract from the quality of AOTC. I can tell from the grammatical flaws and consistent brevity in the positive reviews that young adults are writing them. Here's a message you should think about: it's OKAY to have critical thinking about the entertainment you are consuming! It's okay to recognize the warts on this toad of a sci-fi film and not go with the herd mentality that this movie is less than great. It's okay to have standards higher than yesterday's boxer shorts. Please, you run the risk of being an unthinking robot who will like anything popular if you just think that the flavor of the month is the best flavor ever.I did not hate AOTC, but I did not love it. The movie was so badly written and directed that George Lucas has lost whatever appeal he had for me when he was younger and more adventurous. To paraphrase a line from another film, he would do best to take a hard look at the stuff he's shoveling. He might actually believe all the hype he's generated. For those of you die hard fans who think I'm on the other side of the fence, think again. I saw the first trilogy with the kind of rabid adoration you give the prequels. I skipped school on Wednesday May 25, 1983 to see ROTJ on opening day. I love the mythology and grandeur suggested by the original trilogy. I loathe the effort that went into making a film of such inexplicable superficiality and vapidity. Lucas could have given half the money to feed Bangladesh, cut some of the badly introduced exposition, hired Bill Goldman to script doctor, and made a better film. Or talk to J.M. Stracyinzski on how to make a powerful sci-fi story that has humanity and pathos and energy and darkness. Or just give the reins over to someone who can direct your movies better than you (which should be easy for you to find).I suppose it is disillusioning to watch someone milk their own franchise just because they want to make movies only their grandkids will really understand.",4,0,0,3 June 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Meega na la queesta!
","What do you say first about 'Lilo and Stitch'? Do you stand slackjawed to learn the film cost $80 million to make when it looks considerably cheaper? Do you revel in its totally irreverent moments and clever touches? Or do you talk about the overall feel of the film?Frankly, L+S is just so-so. It has some of the funniest moments in a Disney film ('My friends needs to be punished.') and some of the most disjointed. It does not feel as consistently whacky as 'The Emperor's New Groove' or as saccharine as ANYTHING from Disney in the last two years. Some of the characters are priceless, though, and I like Stitch a great deal. To me, though, that's not nearly enough to make it a classic. Let's face it: the studio paid $80 million for THIS? On what?Compare the storytelling and animation of this movie to 'Spirit' that came out within a week of L+S's debut and got clobbered at the box office, and you might understand why I cannot give this movie super-high marks.",7,2,2,23 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Yeah, very good, but ...
","There is no doubt that TTT is amazing. It's epic. It does everything to flesh out its characters. It continues the story with a faithfulness to the spirit if not the storyline of Tolkien.But is it better than FotR? I think not.TTT does an amazing job with fleshing out Gollum, for example. He is an accomplishment, but hardly perfect. His subtle facial changes and manic schizoid monologues are worth watching a second time. Serkis voices him with a creepiness that I could only hope for. But he's still CGI, and it's too apparent at times.Where Gollum is close to perfect, Faramir is a step in the opposite direction. For those who recall, Boromir was a complex character in the movie FotR. Faramir had even more opportunity to be fleshed out, in acts of pity or a look in the face. Instead, Faramir is a bully, little better than his brother. I never got the impression that he was a good guy. And that is not true to the character as Tolkien wrote him.Aragorn's story is ... eh. A SF Guardian review said that the film is wonderful when it's faithful to the written word of Tolkien. The subplot of Aragorn and Arwen was not in the original story for a good reason, and it shows in this film. Even though it is well acted, it is such a showstopper. Its only moment of excellence is when Elrond really hammers home to Arwen what choosing Aragorn would mean for her. For that reason, I do not trash this part of the film mercilessly. But it could have been handled SO much better.TTT does NOT have enough Legolas. Period. He is easily one of the most amazing characters to come out of fantasy movies, and he is underutilized. Gimli is wonderful, but little more than comic relief. It's criminal that he has pathos and drama in the extended version of FotR but is really two dimensional in TTT. Ah, but for just one hour more.Overall, TTT will be remembered many years from now. But better than its preceding film? Not really. It's about the same, which is not faint praise either.",9,0,0,19 December 2002
Schindler's List," Faithful, if imperfect masterpiece
","For anyone to adapt the novel as well as Spielberg has, that person would have to be a genius. The story is long, involved, and makes no bones about the ambivalence and inconsistence of Oskar Schindler. The tale is not nearly as simple as that of rescue. The adaptation and direction are perfect ... with one exception. The ending is rushed, the melodramatic speech by Schindler is terribly out of tone with the movie, and the playing of 'Jerusalem of Gold' over the placing of stones on the Schindler grave is ludicrous to anyone who is Jewish and over forty. The last ten minutes of 'Schindler's List' are pure and unfortunate Hollywood, plain and simple.But the film has so much power and masterful storytelling in it that these flaws are tiny by comparison. The performances are heartbreaking, the tension tight and often less predictable than anyone could think, and the touches of color in the black & white film are symbolically exact. What happens in this movie is such a powerful illustration of anti-Semitism and the backdrop of Nazism that it is unquestionably required viewing for anyone who needs to see how insidious and destructive prejudice is, and how the Holocaust changed the world of the 20th Century.My father and I saw this in the theater. He survived Auschwitz-Bierkinau and Matthausen. When he walked out of the movie, he clucked his tongue and stated flatly, 'It was worse than that.' I was in tears for hours. The disparity in that moment said much more to me than the movie itself about the story Spielberg had taken upon himself to tell. So be warned that this film is not for the faint of heart. Oddly, the cynics will probably view this movie with inexplicable dispassion. After all, how could anything this horrible have ever taken place within our lifetime?",10,2,10,2 January 2003
The Man Who Would Be King," A powerful gem
","From the casting to the cinematography to the sweeping story, this film is genuinely a classic. Connery and Caine have chemistry that is real on the screen. They are so believable that I cared about these scoundrels throughout the film. Amazing tale that has to be seen and dwelt upon before watching adventure movies set in the exotic unknown.One of my favorite adventure films. Please see it.",7,9,12,23 October 2000
Men in Black II," Smarter and sharper
","Perhaps my review of this movie is so positive simply because I expected MIIB to suck. The professional reviews were not glowing in mid 2002, and I actually missed seeing this film on its theatrical run because of them. The fact is that MIIB is superb because it is SMART. It is self-satirizing, subtle, sprightly-paced and well performed. Will Smith's seeming biting back of the words that he just said is so delightful, and the film is not smeared with profanity or unnecessary juvenile humor. Tommy Lee is snappy in his delivery, and Rosario Dawson and Lara Flynn Boyle are not merely beautiful but thoroughly smart.In writing this script, someone decided not to dumb down the story. Still, the first film has some of the most memorable lines, where this movie has some of the most memorable scenes. I admit that I laughed HARD when Frank the dog did his extremely predictable but marvelously delivered jokes. Some of the jokes are just chuckleworthy, but they're ALL fairly funny. And Sonnenfeld did something that respected the audience's intelligence in his direction. You can watch the movie more than once and catch many details without getting bored.I cannot give MIIB too many points because it loses something for some cheap jokes, but it's a film I recommend you see because it is so much more smarter than its predecessor.",7,1,2,30 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Goodbye, Friends of Hagrid ...
","SOME SPOILERS BUT NOTHING TERRIBLELet us start off with a quick summary of this reviewer: I *am* a Harry Potter fan, and I did have several expectations from this film. I loved having the chance to watch it, but I seriously doubt I will go and see it again until it makes its inevitable migration to DVD.That is not to say I did not admire everyone involved for their extraordinary efforts in bringing the second HP book to life. The casting, production design, acting and subtle background nuances are part of what makes this film grand. I loved seeing the Weasley home and the Ford Anglia, and I thought the movie did not try to adapt *everything* from the book into the finished film. Jason Isaacs was not my first choice for Lucius Malfoy (I thought that honor should have gone to Charles Dance), nor was Gilderoy Lockhart being portrayed by Kenneth Branaugh (Alan Cummings would have been deliciously narcissistic), but these are nitpicks. Overall, the film wins, and so do we. The Quidditch game alone is intense and exciting.Incidentally, if you found Dobby and Moaning Myrtle annoying, GOOD. That was definitely intentional. If you think every character is supposed to be lovable or despicable, think again. Rowling did not create such two dimensional contrivances. That is one reason her works are so fascinating to so many of *all* ages.But CoS has problems that make it less than terrific. For one thing, the pacing is a bit too slow. So faithful an adaptation of the book has given us this overlong, plodding cow instead of a tightly focused bit of storytelling. Some purists will say that the first movie was long, so why shouldn't the second one be equally long? Simply because the first movie was introducing the world of Harry Potter to us. In this film, that world is established. Some parts of the book, while wonderful to read, just lengthen the film unnecessarily. I thought some inclusions (like Mrs. Norris the cat getting petrified) were slavishly unnecessary for those who never read the book. (If you have read CoS, you learn Filch was a 'mudblood', so the attack on his cat keeps with the entire theme of mudbloods getting attacked.)Some characterizations were inconsistent for purists of the series. Snape was downright kindly to Lockhart in the Wizard's duel. The Snape of the book looked like he was going to turn Lockhart into a red stain. Fawkes was almost great, but not quite. And Minerva McGonagall was too easily terrified compared to the tough lady from the first film.Then there's Hagrid. First of all, he barely has any screen time in this movie. To make up for it, he is given this rousing standing ovation at the end of the film that is downright ridiculous. Hagrid's reaction to being imprisoned in Azkaban is that it was inconsequential. In fact, Azkaban is terrifying, but from Hagrid's reaction to being taken there, you would never know it.I liked CoS, but I could not love it like I did the first film. It get's a mostly positive review, but it's not as great as it could have been.",8,0,0,25 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Quintessential Sci-Fi Masterpiece
","In 2002, science fiction can only be described as laden with special effects. Quality stories are few and far between, with a return to the fantasy genre as a last refuge for the scoundrel. The two Star Wars prequels further illustrate this weakness in science fiction. In other words, we are always making comparisons to THIS film, the grandmaster of all modern science fiction films, 'The Empire Strikes Back'.ESB stands on its own merits for so many reasons that I can only hope to give a partial list. Having gotten out of the way the troublesome task of introducing us to the Star Wars universe in the 1977 adventure, we can now jump into the frantic struggle of the Rebellion. Anything introduced in 'Star Wars' is simply improved upon in ESB, not overproduced and overrefined. The look of ESB is real, gritty, elegant, and sometimes even glowing (as in the Cloud City). The elements of creating mood and atmosphere are so perfect that it is no wonder they are copied in so many other films, often to poor effect. The music alone goes from brooding to anxious to frantic to mysterious to exotic with such balance that it defines perfection for future SW film scores.The acting is real and hard and makes no apologies. It is neither over-the-top nor sleepwalked through, and each character is at his/her highest note. Yes, the technobabble in some points sounds stupid at times, but it's overpowered by the myriad other positive elements in the storytelling. ESB is the last movie made before the Indiana Jones films forever influenced adventure movies with the relentlessly overlapping and often ridiculous action that hurt 'Return of the Jedi' in 1983. ('Raiders of the Lost Ark' would hammer home the formula of serials to the extent that RotJ would be fraught with juvenile moments and caricaturizations of beloved characters, but that's another story.)Yoda was, at the time of ESB's release, a technological miracle of storytelling. Here was a muppet that audiences just *knew* was real, somewhere in the Universe. His wisdom reached deep into the human soul, sounding ominous, real, and masterful. The power of the character of Yoda is seen in how many adults as well as teenagers and kids in 1980 accepted him as real and respectable.What more could be said about 'The Empire Strikes Back'? It's the masterpiece all others strive to become similar to and never achieve. It ends on a cliffhanger and yet is a self-contained story. It's a classic even if it is seen before it has had the benefit of ILM's special edition rework. It is, in short, perfect storytelling.",10,0,1,5 December 2002
Gangs of New York," Hemmed in by good intentions and bad decisions
","Martin Scorcese had his hands full getting this story told. Historical dramas are a hit-or-miss in Hollywood cinema. Sometimes, you get a classic and sometimes you get a forgettable mess. Worse, sometimes, you get a mish-mash that is lukewarm and gets forgotten in the fullness of time (Once Upon a Time in America leaps to mind.)The casting of this film is right and wrong on so many levels that I feel sorry for the director rather than take issue with him. Cameron Diaz and Leo DiCaprio do not belong in this film. It's not to impugn their acting skills, but this movie was simply the wrong vehicle for them. Leonardo DiCaprio is a good actor, but he is not a great one, and the role of Amsterdam needed to be carried by a great actor. The same goes for Cameron Diaz. No offense, but Scorcese should have fired the accent coach for these two principal cast members.Some events in the story were outright and unnecessary falsehoods. SPOILER ALERT: Federal ships firing on the Five Points not only never happened, but it doesn't make any sense! Why randomly destroy property in a part of the city that was not even a focal point of the riots!? Why risk hitting your own troops?  That plot hole detracted from a story that took great pains to be accurate and faithful to the spirit of that era.I give Martin Scorcese an A for effort but a C+ for the result. Sorry, dude. In the years to come, this film will be in the same boat as The Patriot and Once Upon a Time in America.",7,0,0,17 July 2003
Braveheart," 'Ye must've made quite an imprassion ---'
","Mel Gibson understood something really simple when he successfully directed the 1995 epic, 'Braveheart', that subsequent directors of Randall Wallace stories did not, and that is how to capture and really transfer to the audience that visceral feeling of satisfying revenge through physical vengeance. Every time some villain gets his in this film, we feel it. We also feel the pain and the injustice of William Wallace's world. This is why the movie is a powerful story.To be sure, look at other films with similar ingredients of high quality. Watch movies with poignant ethnic-themed scores. Watch movies with unparalleled action and battle scenes. Watch movies with heartbreaking love stories. Rarely do they get it ALL right. But 'Braveheart' does, and it does so gloriously.The movie also has really BIG flaws, the least of which is that it seems to take a LONG time to get to the point, that being the ending. Historians cringe when they consider 'Braveheart' because of all of the liberties it takes with historical fact. And the death scene of Wallace becomes inadvertently corny by the very end. ('The prisoner wishes to say something. Quick bring the megaphone! All right, Mr. I-am-loopier-than-a-bowl-of-Froot-Loops, what have you got to say?' The hero tosses his head back and forth before uttering the 'unexpected' cry: 'FREEDOM!')But minor flaws like those cannot diminish the previous two and a half hours of epic score, grim battles, painfully realized love, ironic humor, betrayals, victories and heartbreaks. And most of all, you do not doubt Wallace's words: 'All men die. Not every man lives.' In many ways, this film is 'Spartacus' for the 1990's.",9,2,4,22 November 2002
The Godfather," An unparalleled masterpiece
","Many reviews talk about the genius evidenced in this masterpiece of 'gangster' movies. Of course, it really is a family movie, with a story set in the gangster world. What can I add that has not been said already? The simple fact that this classic captures the family dynamic that is practically gone from movies of the last 20 years.The movie does not drown in schmaltz or sappy emotion. The love of the sons for the Godfather is natural and understandable. We can all identify with loving someone so much that we would be willing to die for them, or worse. The togetherness as well as the personal prejudices of the Corleone family (esp. Sonny) make the dynamic totally believable.I loved this movie, and I can watch it over and over. In fact, I think I will!",10,0,1,16 October 2000
