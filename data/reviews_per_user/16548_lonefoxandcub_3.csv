The Blair Witch Project," The only film I've ever seen that genuinely scared me
","By now there can't be anyone that hasn't seen, or at least knows the basic premise of The Blair Witch Project.A film made to look like a documentary made by 3 college students about an urban legend.All I will say is this: If you haven't seen it yet, watch it by yourself at night, and tell me you don't feel goosebumps, particularly during the last 5 minutes of the film. I hadn't seen it in a couple of years, literally just finished watching it... I know what happens, and STILL it gives me chills.There's no FX, no flashy camera work, no witch(!)... and yet it's the most genuinely scary movie I've ever seen. I don't mean you jump because a door bangs, I mean you actually feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up because... you don't see a damn thing. That is a rare experience.Genius.",10,2,4,21 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lightsabers! Robots! Spaceships! Aliens! Bounty Hunters! Etc! Yes, it's Star Wars.
","Stick a lightsaber in a movie and I'm happy. Seriously. Not a biased review whatsoever. 10 years after the battle of Naboo (in The Phantom Menace) Anakin has grown into a talented Jedi, though very reckless. He also has all the traits teenagers have- moody, irresponsible, fancies the pretty senator... that kind of thing. Obi Wan's becoming increasingly concerned over his Padawans behaviour, while the Jedi Council struggle to keep the peace as the galaxy appears to be on the brink of war. Amidala, former Queen of Naboo and now senator, is placed under protection of the Jedi after an assassination attempt- unfortunately her 'Jedi bodyguard' can't necessarily be trusted...Boo hoo if you want to moan about prequels, Ewoks, Jar Jar, Anakins ghost, directors re- edited special ultimate redux DVD editions, whatever. Star Wars rocks. Fact. The film hardly lets up pace from the chase through Coruscant to Obi Wan's Raymond Chandler-esquire investigation into the development of a clone army (the precursor to the Stormtroopers of the original trilogy) to the finale when war is declared and just about the biggest Jedi showdown ever (so far). And I won't even mention what happens when you mess with Anakins mother...Classic tale of good versus evil, jaw dropping special effects, plenty of that'll-tie-in-to- Episode-IV-nicely moments...And you think Episode II was good? Vader's back in the next one!",10,52,92,31 January 2005
Signs," The twist is... you've been suckered once again
","How does this film merit a 7 rating?M Night Shyamalan seems to have carved an unspectacular niche in his own little 'tales of the unexpected' series. Everything about this film seems to have been done as an afterthought. No, it's not scary. No, it contains no real action to speak of. No, it's characters are not developed beyond a contrived subplot (or rather, only plot) of a preacher losing faith. Shyamalan seems to try so hard to present the amazing in an unamazing manner, that the result is... just dull (The Village is a prime example of his 'technique').As for the infamous water storyline, I don't want to hear about it being a metaphor, or it's the germs or whatever other excuse you can dream up to justify bad storytelling. These are the facts:Aliens vastly superior to us invade Earth, but are allergic to water. EARTH. A planet that is something like 70% water, populated by humans (also largely made up from water) who cry water when upset (a handy defence against these invaders eh?). Oh, and it has been known to rain here from time to time.There's a hell of a lot more pollution in the air than in our water, but hey. Don't tell the scriptwriter. He's trying to be clever.",1,3,7,23 May 2006
