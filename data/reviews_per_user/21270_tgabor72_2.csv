Blade Runner 2049," What's the point??
","It's so boring I would fall asleep two or three times if the music was not too loud. Sound mixing is a disaster. The only reason I did not leave the theater was that the story always had something above the threshold minimum to stay. Too many pointless scenes. Even pointless violence. And for God's sake, what's the point of the ending?? Is this all from the sequel of a masterpiece: to die for the good purpose? Really? It's so weak that it hurts. The only positive thing about the movie that it tries very hard to respect the first one, that's why I gave two stars. But it's way too superficial.Ps.: For the professionals: It's time to learn to create an atmosphere without so much color grading! At least look at the original....",2,66,137,8 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Pathetic
","I wanted to write a detailed review of TLJ, but to be honest everything has already been written by other reviewers. Just in short titles again:<ul><li>pointless story</li><li>painful logical stupidity</li><li>a complete mess</li><li>zero dramaturgy</li><li>poor humor</li><li>kills the SW feeling</li><li>etc. etc.</li></ul>I honestly believe that this movie is not a parody nor a satire, but a desecration of the entire saga. I seriously begin to think that this step was planned well in advance. It seems like Disney is testing the stupidity of the crowd. Or worse: they would like to destroy the SW universe. I don't see why, all universes they manage (eg. Marvel and SW) has it's own space, they do not interfere with each other. But simply I can't find any other logical explanation of this disaster. So, if you don't want to be disappointed because of how your dreams gonna fall apart, just go home, watch the original trilogy and forget future SW episodes for good.I gave 2 stars only for two reasons:<ul><li>no lame CGI characters (eg. Tarkin and Leia)</li><li>really exceptional and perfect technical implementation and visuals.</li></ul>*** FICTION ***
Somebody mentioned that Leia could be the one who sacrifies herself for the rebellion, and that would be a respectful tribute for Carrie Fisher. I absolutely agree. On top of that, if Luke was the other one who dies because feeling his sister's death and of tiredness of the battle, then they could reunite in the force and show up in the final scene for Rey and Finn.... (and end titles....)This way, 'The last Jedi' could be Leia and Luke, and Rey and Finn at once, leaving soooo much possibility and the force and the magic of SW for the next episodes....How is this possible that even I can write a better story than the eggheads at Disney?!?",1,1,1,16 December 2017
