50 First Dates," More Sandler Brilliance
","Fantastic film, great storyline, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are just brilliant together, Loved Jocko the walrus, and Willie the penguin, Film has brilliant twists to it, i like the way Lucy (Drew Barrymore) knows Henry (sandler) one minute and likes him and the next she doesn't know who he is!! A cracking bit of acting on Both parts. Rob Schneider is great as Ula too. Overall the film is a definite 10 out of 10 for both the writers and the actors. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore should work together on more cracking comedies and keep us entertained for years to come, I have most of Sandlers films on DVD and i have to admit he is one of my favourite actors and Drew Likewise, if ever there were people who could make you laugh and/or cry at the same time then its these two comedy geniuses",10,1,2,11 October 2005
