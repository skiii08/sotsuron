The Blair Witch Project," Chilling, birthed a sub-genre of horror and made lots of dough
","The chilling faux documentary haunted me as a child and still spooked me today as a sequel opens up in theaters seventeen years from the original's release. The movie is filmed with hand-held cameras operated by three film students purported to have disappeared in the Maryland woods with only this footage to surface sometime later. Even though their fates are sealed viewers may fear the plight of the two young men and a woman who become lost rather fast and then are slowly driven insane by a stalking presence that visits them in the night and leaves horrifying gifts outside their tent.Heather Donahue plays herself as the lead documentarian. She convinces Josh Leonard and Michael C. Wiliams to venture out into the woods after interviewing the locals and hearing all sorts of terrifying stories. Heather insists for some time that they are not lost though both Michael and Josh know they are. On the second night out in the woods all sorts of terrible sounds can be heard but the team can't capture any of it on film.The horrors grow and the rough shaky angles of the camera only add to the confusion and terror. The dread increases to dramatic as the characters all grow more frustrated and turn on each other. Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez know how to draw out the dread and only give viewers a glimpse of the strange occurrences, but a glimpse is all that is needed to generate the fear to make this movie a smashing success. On the tiny, for a film, budget of $60,000, it managed to gross $248.6 million.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7,0,1,16 September 2016
Despicable Me 2," A hilarious and cute animated sequel
","The silly animated film spawned a comedic sequel that pretty much lives up to the original. Gru (Steve Carell) has given up his life as a villain to be a father to his three adopted daughters.

Blade Runner 2049," A long dazzling sci-fi sequel to a classic
","This film may be one of the longest I see this year at nearly two and a half hours. Films by Denis Villeneuve move at a slow steady pace with long shots. This sequel to the 80s cult classic is gorgeous and mesmerizing as it moves around various parts of this futuristic west from trash heaps in San Diego to the red desert of an abandoned Las Vegas. Los Angeles is constantly stormy or snowing as the detection takes place in drab buildings or on dark city streets. The film begins with text informing the viewer that in the thirty years since the original film the Tyrell corporation has become bankrupt and the Wallace corporation has taken over. Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is a new version of the blade runner but also a newer model replicant. He arrives at the house of Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista), a maggot farmer. He confronts him about his identity and the two fight until K finally kills Sapper with a pistol blast to the head. Before he leaves the site, his drone notices a strange box buried beneath a tree.K must go through tests to keep him at a baseline as they monitor the replicants more closely. Madam Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright) is K's superior officer. Other people know K is a 'skinjob' and yell slurs at him or write them on his apartment door. He has a virtual woman for company, Joi (Ana de Armas). He brings home a new update that allows her to travel around but he's called back to the office before he gets to use it. The box beneath ground contained bones of a recently pregnant woman but K zooms in to find a serial number etched mysteriously on the bones. Lieutenant Joshi is disturbed by the revelation that replicants can reproduce and orders K to destroy the evidence. Tracking the serial number brings K to the Wallace corporation where he is met by the replicant Luv (Sylvia Hoeks). She identifies the number as belonging to Rachel and plays the recorder from the first film when Deckard (Harrison Ford) tested her.

Angels & Demons," A mediocre sequel
","Tom Hanks and Ron Howard return to another adaption of Dan Brown's thriller Angels & Demons. The book is the first of Robert Langdon's adventures but came out as a sequel to the box office success of The Da Vinci Code though the chronology isn't exactly clear from my viewing of which comes first. I had the time to just read this novel as I started the series when I heard of the recent adaptation so I can compare more directly with the text. The movie skips of interactions in CERN and the murder investigation and jumps directly to the terroristic plot that can only be stopped by Langdon's solving of the clues.Hanks's Langdon teams up with Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) to find the anti-matter that Vetra help create with her uncle? before it blow up the Vatican as part of an Illuminati plot. Working with the Vatican police headed by Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgard) and assisted by Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino), Langdon and Vetra achieve access to the Vatican archives but only after being granted permission by the Camerlengo Patrick Mckenna (Ewan McGregor).

10 Cloverfield Lane," Slow at points but pretty cool by the end!
","I'm a bit torn about how to review this movie. On one hand, certain parts of it were really good and intense. I jumped at moments. On the other hand, the story had some strange beats and became boring in the middle lulling me into complacency and even though it returned with a bang, it still felt like there were some unnecessary parts that could've left more for the ending.The acting was great between John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and John Gallagher Jr.. Winstead carried the film but this isn't her first time in the driver's seat of a horror movie. She did well in The Thing and did well here as well. Goodman was extra intriguing as a creepy bunker builder. Most of the movie depends on the acting performances and takes place within the confines of the bunker so it's nice that the actors are quality.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",6,2,7,10 March 2016
The Finest Hours," The Finest Hours is a fun action thriller with a romantic core!
","Disney's Coast Guard rescue thriller kept the pacing accelerated through the first part but suffered from a slow ending. The Finest Hours was divided up into several stories that intertwined between rescuers, lovers and the sailors at risk. The beginning focused on the love story between Bernie Webber played by Chris Pine and Miriam Webber played by Holliday Grainger. They met after talking on the phone for a while so there was some interesting chemistry, and director Craig Gillesphie did a good job quickly establishing their romance. The plot rapidly moves to the storm that threatened the crew of the T-2 tanker with Casey Affleck's Ray Sybert taking the lead. The whole crew was staffed with good actors like John Ortiz, Graham McTavish, and Josh Stewart. The acting was pretty superb throughout this movie. Eric Bana was the Coast Guard chief and brought some depth with a Souther accent. Rachel Brosnahan who had a great role in House of Cards also pops up near the end. Ben Foster was part of the crew and he delivers a good performance as usual.Check out more of this review and other at swilliky.com",6,0,8,31 January 2016

It," Solid horror film and adaptation of the iconic Stephen King
","The latest iteration of the horror classic creates a vivid sense of terror while telling a heartfelt tale of youth while reinvigorating the iconic image of Pennywise from our generations most popular horror writer. Stephen King's book is a very long, yet great, read. I'm only about three hundred pages in and enjoying it more than most books. The massive amount of information is compressed nicely in this film that serves as a first part of the story, the childhood part. The liberties they take only add to the horror and keep the pacing moving somewhat swiftly though at times it felt stalled and the scares don't compare to other prominent films in the genre. I found the movie very entertaining and I think it will grow on me but there were certainly flaws that I would like to see improved upon if there is a sequel. With positive reviews and a crowded theater, I think it's likely that we will get to see the second half in a few years.Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher) struggles with a stutter especially after he sends his younger brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) out with a boat and the boy goes missing. Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor) is the new kid in school and has to deal with the ruthless bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton). He retreats to the library but not before awkwardly blushing in front of his crush Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis). Beverly has to deal with own set of bullies including her abusive father. Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) works on the sheep farm with his grandfather bolting the animals in the head but he's haunted by the images of his parents burning behind a door. Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard) is the loudmouth who is skeptical of the hauntings. Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff) studies for his bat mitzvah when a horrific image comes to life.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,4,10,9 September 2017
Detroit," A horrifying story that is approached with distance
","It has been clear long before I was born that something is wrong with the country and the souls of those in authority are corrupt. Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit exposes another terrible chapter in dramatic fashion that feels a bit off in its depiction of horrific violence. The story gives a brief background of the tension through a cartoon that feels far too simplistic for a nuanced view of a centuries old struggle and growing corruption in law and order. There is a short scene that plays no real significance in the rest of the film except to introduce the supposed cause of the riots but then it jumps to the major characters of this sickening story. The character that is most interesting and takes the role of protagonist in this harrowing tale is Larry (Algee Smith), a singer whose attempt at fame and a chance at the stage for his Motown group is cut short due to the riots. He and his friend Fred (Jacob Latimore) flee the angry police and raging fires to hide out the night in the Algiers hotel. Dismukes (John Boyega) works private security for a grocery store trying to help black men escape the brutality of the patrolling officers and national guard. Krauss (Will Poulter) is a racist police officer whose trigger happy nature with a shotgun earns him a homicide investigation before the events at the Algiers hotel. Larry and Fred flirt with two white women Julie (Hannah Murray) and Karen (Kaitlyn Dever) who bring them to meet some friends.

Wind River," Another great thriller from Taylor Sheridan
","Taylor Sheridan is one of my favorite film writers and now in the director's chair, he has made a film of equal caliber.

The jurisdiction of the reservation territory means that Sheriff Ben (Graham Greene) must call in the FBI.

Star Trek," A fun reboot of a classic sci-fi story
","The reboot of the beloved franchise turned to the remake master J.J. Abrams for the updated Star Trek. Abrams already had shown quality directing but he proved his science fiction skill with this fun and awe-inspiring new vision. I'm not as familiar with the original Star Trek films and TV show so I came into this movie with relatively little knowledge. While I didn't convert to full-on Trekkie, I did appreciate what these films had to offer. The new actors were a great recasting of classic characters, and I liked everyone who appears in this film. The film introduced Chris Hemsworth to the general public before his appearance as the Marvel hero Thor. His short prologue scene was memorable enough to recall him when the Thor casting was announced plus did a great job dragging an unknowing viewer like me into the excitement of the story. The plot also takes a unique approach with a clever time travel plot that ties in the old and the new.The movie served primarily as an origin for Captian James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto). It focuses on their relationship and reintroduces the beloved characters to a new audience and avid fans. Kirk was not planning on joining Star Fleet and spends his time driving fast cars and getting into barroom brawls. After one brawl over trying to get the name of a Star Fleet cadet who later turns out to be Uhura (Zoe Saldana), he is confronted by Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood).Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,1,3,16 July 2016
Memento," Crazy storytelling and brilliant twists from Christopher Nolan
","Christopher Nolan made an excellent film for his second time out with a bigger budget and wild story. Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) has short term memory loss so the entire story plays out backward. Leonard kills Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) because he believes he is the one from instructions written on the back of a photograph. He uses tattoos to help him understand what he needs to remember and the message scrawled permanently on his body leads him to a man named John G. who raped and murdered his wife (Jorja Fox). Revenge is his primary motivation and he uses facts and clues to fuel his constant investigation. He meets up with Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who leads him back to Teddy, whose real name is John Gammell. He tells everyone about his condition that he meets including the hotel manager Burt (Mark Boone Junior) who profits off his condition by renting him a second room. Leonard has been drawn into something dangerous by Natalie as he is attacked by a man named Dodd (Callum Keith Rennie) who he beats up and requests Teddy help him scare off.

Underworld," Decent but nothing special
","The series begins at the supposed end of the war between the vampires and lycans. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a death dealer vampire that hunts werewolves, introduced dropping from a building where she was scowling like a gargoyle. The whole movie is a goth dream mimicking gunplay, leather, heavy metal, and superpowers from the popularity of The Matrix and adding the fantastical twist of mythology.Selene notices that the remaining lycans are trailing a particular human Michael (Scott Speedman). The head of the lycans Lucian (Michael Sheen) has taken a particular interest in Michael. The movie contains some great action scenes that I remember really pleasing me when I was much younger. I always thought this movie had a great mix of action and horror tropes.The plot is all sorts of jumbled picking up in the middle of a story so as to dull any sort of character emotional impact and confusing lots of different threads. There are treacheries and magical happenings that all come together with a bit of ridiculousness that is to be expected in these types of movies. The action lifts it up and the special effects don't look terrible even after thirteen years of advancement. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",6,0,2,7 January 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," First of what I hope are many Star Wars spinoffs
","The first of what is presumably many to come of Star Wars spin off films explains the structural defects of the Death Star that made destruction so simple in the original film and the plot to steal the plans that allowed the climax to happen.The story follows Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), the daughter of scientist Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) who helped construct the Death Star and a rebel that is almost even too rebellious for the Rebellion. Jyn is freed from prison to help enact a plan to discover a message that has been delivered by an Empire defector, the pilot Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed).In order to find the pilot, Jyn teams up with Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and the droid K-2S0 (voiced by Alan Tudyk) to seek out her old mentor Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker). The story bounces around from planet to planet creating an even larger galaxy that fans always assumed was out there but now can see and apply names. The shots of the various planets are beautiful and Gareth Edwards does a great job directing these expansive shots like he did with the Godzilla remake.

Dawn of the Dead," Fast Zombies!!!! Great Remake
","This movie and the 28 days and months, and maybe Zombieland, have the fast moving zombies, which are so much more scarier than the shambling ones. The beginning is so quick and concise right to the action and that overhead shot showing the spread is amazing. Good acting, not the best, probably the weakest part though I think there were certain performances that stood out like Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley. This seems to be where Zack Snyder showed his talent and has gone on to do great things. Also James Gunn's writing has that great sense of enjoyable horror and action that has shown through in several of his other works. I think this movies was what first engaged me in zombie films and how terrifying they really can be. It brought the next generation since this was a remake of an old classic and though the story is similar, it feels fresh. (Spoiler: the biggest flaw is the zombie baby) This is my first review so I hope to get better at this as I go along!",8,1,1,20 August 2015
Alien: Resurrection," A fun expansion of the Alien franchise
","The fourth installment in the Alien franchise resuscitates the series with a clever conceit from the writing of Joss Whedon. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been cloned by remnants of her DNA in order for the military to harvest the xenomorphs. Weyland has long been defunct, bought out by Wal-Mart, but the military of the United Systems is still making the same mistakes by training to gather and harvest the alien creatures. A crew of smugglers led by Elgyn (Michael Wincott) brings a human cargo to the military spaceship in exchange for money and a brief stay. The aliens are tested by the researchers Gediman (Brad Dourif) and Dr. Wren (J.E. Freeman). General Perez (Dan Hedaya) leads the military operation.The aliens learn quickly and kill one of their own to melt through their enclosures and escape. They proceed to kill the military but the smugglers remain alive. Call (Winona Ryder) was secretly working with the smugglers in order to kill Ripley and stop the aliens. Elgyn is killed by the aliens during the initial attack, and the remaining smugglers including Johner (Ron Perlman), Christie (Gary Dourdan), and the handicapped Vriess (Dominique Pinon) attempt to escape. Along with fellow smuggler, Elgyn's lover Hillard (Kim Flowers) and another surviving soldier Distephano (Raymond Cruz), the crew tries to make it past the 12 remaining xenomorphs.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",6,1,1,21 May 2017
Passengers," Creepy and shallow sci-fi romance
",Passengers suffers from poor plotting and a creepy storyline that offers a lackluster redemption of the male lead. It feels rushed and not deserved and makes the movies have a strange message that leaves viewers feeling weird at the end. The movie relied on its two stars to make it succeed at the box office but bad reviews and tough competition kept if from being a breakout success.The story is about Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) who wakes up on a spaceship due to a malfunctioning sleeping pod and finds himself stranded by himself with 90 years still to go on his journey. The movie doesn't do a great job of making it clear that Jim is alone and desperate for company. He tries a few things for entertainment including talking to the robotic bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen) but gives up and starts obsessing over another sleeping passenger.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com,3,3,7,3 January 2017

Star Trek Into Darkness," Action-packed, cool villain
","The rebooted alternate timeline of Gene Roddenberry's creation continues with the sequel Into Darkness. After the initial film established the main crew of the Starship Enterprise, the second one picks up with Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) in a dire situation with Bones (Karl Urban) as they run from an alien species with a sacred scroll. The tension of the opening scene only rises as we find Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) in the middle of a volcano.The whole crew returns with Sulu (John Cho), Scotty (Simon Pegg), and Chekov (Anton Yelchin). Even Pike (Bruce Greenwood) returns as an Admiral now, still scolding Kirk for his brash attitude towards intergalactic relationships. A new terrorist rises as John Harrington that is quickly revealed to be the iconic Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch). I was not aware of this character before but found out upon a little research that this casting was another white actor cast into a role previously portrayed by an Indian actor, so that is disappointing. But Khan is portrayed as powerful and evil and it is hard to deny Cumberbatch's acting talent.The special effects looked great as J. J. Abrams returns to director bringing plenty of lens flare in outer space. The action takes the crew out into Klingon space, which is the first appearance of this dangerous aliens in the new universe. The story mimics the fast pace of its predecessor and raises the stakes with several plot twists. Some new character pop up including Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) and her father Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) who have secret motivations.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,2,5,19 July 2016

Green Room," A brutal, intense, and violent horror movie
","The most brutal and intense movie of this year, Green Room is directed by Jeremy Saulnier, the director of the Netflix thriller Blue Ruin. This violent horror movie shows that this up and coming director has a lot of talent to make movies that shock and amaze viewers with a slow burn but also a payoff that is a jolt to your senses.Though a horror film, it does not fall for any of the clichés or typical pitfalls but keeps an intense forward momentum that doesn't let up and holds some genuine jumps that are not foolish or cheap. I was thoroughly entertained, and this film will leave theatergoers blown away. This will be a movie to remember when making my top ten list at the end of the year!Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",9,3,11,14 May 2016
The Danish Girl," Redmayne proves he is a great actor, Vikander is amazing as well
","Eddie Redmayne continues to prove he is one of the best actors of this generation. His performance as Lili Elbe will put him once again in the running for Best Actor. Redmayne conveys the confusion and determination of Elbe with grace and this brave woman's courage is shown through the actor. This true story is important to the current times, and I thought it was very inspiring and enlightening. The struggle of Lili to find her place in the world was portrayed with emotion and grace.Alicia Vikander continues to have a break out year following her roles as a lifelike robot in Ex Machina and a brilliant mechanic in The Man from U.N.C.L.E.. Gerda Wegener had to face the reality that her husband was no longer there and had been replaced by the woman she truly felt she was, Lili. Vikander has tears in her eyes in nearly every scene once Lili begins her transformation. She brought true emotional depth to the loyal woman who continued to love her husband not matter what. I think Alicia Vikander will get a nomination and continue to produce great characters in her bright future.See more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7,0,3,31 December 2015
Spider-Man 2," A corny sequel full of mediocrity and boring, though a great villain and action scenes
","The sequel to the original live-action Spider-Man film has an exciting new villain and updated effects but amps up the corniness and cheesy dialogue to make for a mediocre superhero film. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) earns a meager paycheck as a pizza delivery man and a freelance photographer while he matriculates the university though he keeps showing up late to everything, even his own birthday party. Surprising him is Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), Harry Osborn (James Franco), and Aunt may (Rosemary Harris).

Peter is also late on his rent and has a demanding landlord taking every last dollar he receives.Peter hopes to write a paper for his science class on the brilliant new scientist Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) and his experiment to harness power. Hoping to woo Mary Jane, he tries to attend her play but a high-speed chase sends him on a detour, making him late and the usher (Bruce Campbell) prevents him from going in. The failure disappoints him so much that his powers stop working. At the Dr. Octavius's demonstration, the fusion reaction destabilizes and breaches containment killing Dr. Octavius's wife and exploding the chip on his neck, allowing the artificial intelligence in the four mechanical tentacles to take over before Spider-man can shut it down. Harry funded the experiment and blames Spider-man for the humiliation. The tentacles come alive in an operation to take them off and murder all the surgeons in a brief moment of horror. Doctor Octopus emerges grief stricken from the loss of his wife.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",4,2,6,7 July 2017
The Fifth Element," A spectacular sci-fi action film from Luc Besson starring Bruce Willis
","Luc Besson created a wild futuristic universe two decades ago that was fun with a solid good vs. evil story. When a hidden weapon is found amidst the pyramids before the start of the World Wars, an alien race flies down to retrieve it and starts an order of priesthoods that would pass the knowledge down of a holy weapon to fight evil. In the very colorful future, Corbin Dallas (Bruce Willis) drives a taxi having given up his life as a fighter pilot. Absolute evil takes the form of a growing black ball that destroys military spaceships. As the priest, Father Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm) awaits of the fifth element with President Lindberg (Tommy Lister), Jean-Baptist Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman) sends shape-shifting aliens called Mangalores to shoot down the ship and retrieve the four elemental stones. The only survivor of the crash is recreated in a Neurolab into Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) and she breaks out. Her escape sends her crashing down into Corbin's taxi that leads to a wild flying car chase that holds well with special effects these twenty years later.Zorg is angry when he finds the case empty without any stones and tricks the aliens into blowing themselves up with some crazy rifle. Corbin brings Leeloo to Cornelius who helps decipher Leeloo's language that the stones are hidden with an opera singer on a paradise cruise off the planet. Zorg summons Cornelius to find out where the stones are but his bargaining does not go as planned. The evil blob calls Zorg ordering him to find the stones. Corbin finds out he is fired as he finds out he is being recruited for a mission to go to Fhloston Paradise. Unfortunately, Cornelius and Leeloo show up and then the police. The police capture his neighbor but the aliens steal the captive neighbor. Cornelius knocks Corbin over the head stealing the cruise ticket.

Finding Nemo," A great addition to the Pixar brand
","One of Pixar's original successes was the fish adventure, Finding Nemo. The story follows Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) a clownfish who has developed a great fear of the open ocean after his wife and all of his eggs are destroyed by a barracuda, except one, Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould). The story picks up on Nemo's first day of school. He has a small fin due to the accident at his birth. Marlin is anxious about letting his son go but stunts his growth and prevents him from having experiences.Nemo grows frustrated with his overprotective parent and swims out to touch a boat, hilariously referred to by the other young fish as a butt. Nemo is captured by a scuba-diving dentist and whisked away to Sydney, Australia. Distraught, Marlin sets out to find his son. He encounters Dory (voiced by Ellen Degeneres), a blue tang with short-term memory loss. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,0,1,2 July 2016
Creed," A great new addition to the series yet also stands alone!
","I didn't freshen up on my Rocky series memory so I can't recall all of the history, but I do remember that Rocky lost against Apollo Creed but managed to stay through all the rounds in the first movie. I think that's about all the knowledge a viewer needs to go into this movie with though they hinted at other happenings, which left me a bit confused. However, this movie stands alone.The story works as a typical boxing movie with a montage of training and several fights to keep the drama going, all leading up to the final bout, this time in London. The juxtaposition of Rocky's battle with cancer and Adonis's training did add a new level plus the idea of legacy and proving oneself beyond the name we are given. I thought Michael B. Jordan's performance was stellar and he continues to solidify himself as a movie star. I have enjoyed his acting since back in the first seasons of The Wire and he was certainly not the worst part about this year's bomb Fantastic Four. Whenever he was challenging an opponent in the ring, I was instantly on his side and he made rooting for the character easy.Sylvester Stallone returns with another great performance as Rocky Balboa, though this time he is obviously to old to put the gloves on and fight. He was the source of the much of the emotion and I'm glad he returned to push his legacy as this tremendous character. I don't think there will be many more Rambo movies in the future but we'll see how Hollywood reboots that franchise.The directing was also brilliant by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station). This is his second time working with Michael B. Jordan. There is one exceptional fight scene in the middle that has no cuts. It may be one of my favorite boxing scenes in a movie. I hope the rumors are true that he will direct Black Panther because I can tell he would make that movie great. I need to see Fruitvale Station. Tessa Thompson (Dear White People) also did quite a job as the romantic interest. She is another up and coming actress that will be making waves in the film industry for years to come. Overall this movie will be considered as a top ten for this year. I think the only hold back is the familiar tale of boxing is such a retread though this movie did everything it could to break the mold. Eight out of ten stars!

X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The worst X-Men film and does not do Wolverine's origin justice
","The worst X-Men film to date disrupts the continuity and relays the tale of how Logan became Wolverine. I've been more forgiving of this film as I was not as familiar with the canon comics on which it was based. When I first saw the film, I was not aware of the bone claws that are a part of Wolverine's origin. They look awful in the film but so do most of the special effects trying to make something big off a limited budget. Gavin Hood directs this action-adventure that touches some other X-men superhero but disappoints at nearly every turn.The film begins with a young James Howlett who is sickly and unknowing of his true lineage. His half-brother Victor helps him discover his true father and the boys flee after James discovers his bone claws and murders his dad. They run through wars as they grow to manhood as indestructible soldiers. In Vietnam, they are accused of turning on their old platoon. Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Victor (Liev Schreiber) agree to work for General Stryker (Danny Huston) who is forming a superteam. The rest of the mutants on Stryker team are the teleporter John Wraith (Will.i.am), Wade (Ryan Reynolds), Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand), Bolt (Dominic Monaghan), and Agent Zero (Daniel Henney).

Spotlight," A great movie on a difficult topic, one of the best of 2015
","Despite the quality of this film, the disturbingly tragic topic makes this film hard to watch. The ensemble cast is brilliant and the pacing kept a somewhat complicated and slow story very interesting. It's hard to make people talking on the phone and collating data exciting but Tom McCarthy pulled it off though he usual fare is comedy. This is one of the best films of the year and an important one.In a crowded film, Mark Ruffalo stood out as Mike Rezendes, the intrepid reporter who hassled the lawyer of several abuse victims Mitchell Garabedian played by a somber Stanley Tucci. Ruffalo did a great job getting into character and distancing himself from his more popular role as the Incredible Hulk. A speech he gives at the end is one of the most moving in the film. Michael Keaton as delivered a strong performance as the conflicted Boston native Walter Robinson. He didn't match his award snubbed performance in Birdman but he nailed the Boston accent and the emotional turmoil the investigation caused.For more of this review and others, check out swilliky.com",9,8,15,2 December 2015

Spider-Man 3," A disappointing end to a promising superhero trilogy
","The completion of the original motion picture trilogy of the web-slinging superhero fulfilled the contractual obligations of the actors and director, ruined an iconic suit and villain of the canon, and killed this version of the franchise with cheesy mediocrity.

Thor has been captured by the demon Surtur (Clancy Brown) but he breaks free and uses his hammer to fight off Surtur's demon's soldiers and knock off the demon's crown.

He warns of Ragnarok and their sister Hela (Cate Blanchett).The goddess of death returns from her imprisonment and chases Loki and Thor through the Bifrost portal and knocks them out into space.

The Prestige," Great acting and a twisty story about magicians from Christopher Nolan
","After the success of Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan took on magicians for his fourth original film. Two magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) compete for the greatest illusion. The stage manager Cutter (Michael Caine) accuses Alfred of attempting to steal Angier's trick but murdering him instead and sends him to jail in the furthest forward storyline. The film operates on multiple story lines, one that follows Robert searching for the great inventor Tesla (David Bowie) and his assistant Alley (Andy Serkis) in Colorado, and another storyline that tells the history of Angier and Borden as young magicians. These stories come from diaries that the men read of each other. Alfred meets Sarah (Rebecca Hall) at a magic show and falls for her quickly. In the past, Borden tries a special knot that ends up killing Julia (Piper Perabo), Angier's lover. As Borden starts a solo career, Angier confronts him during a bullet catch trick and shoots his finger off.

With the help of Cutter, he performs new tricks with special gadgets but Borden shows up to bust the birdcage and injure a participant. Desperate for a new trick and out of a show, Angier meets with Alley and finally is allowed to meet with Tesla in his hideout.

The Hateful Eight," A violent, dialogue heavy and very entertaining movie!
","Quentin Tarantino's eighth film produced by Miramax is a dialogue heavy, violent Western that strikes a very similar chord to his first film Reservoir Dogs. The primary action in this film takes place in a single room, Minnie's Haberdashery. All the actors were on point though some only had a few moments to shine.Kurt Russell plays John Ruth, a rough bounty hunter. There were so many instances where he smacked around his bounty, Daisy Domergue played brilliantly by Jennifer Jason Leigh, that I'm surprised advocates against images of violence against women aren't up in arms alongside the cops who also claimed to boycott Tarantino's film for an appearance at a Black Lives Matter event. Leigh gives Domergue vicious character and though a viewer doesn't know it at the beginning, eventually one can see her viciousness. Samuel L. Jackson deserves the most praise and rightfully graces center stage in the poster. The heavy-lifting of the dialogue fell to Jackson's Major Marquis Warren. His taunting of the Confederate General Sandy Smithers, an old Civil War vet played by Bruce Dern, gives of the most amusing and disturbing monologue of the film. Major Warren is also responsible for a lot of the gun-slinging and violence as the end heads towards a climax. I've been a fan of Walton Goggins since his performance as Shane in the Shield, and he delivers as the Sheriff Chris Mannix with classic Goggins flair sounding just right spouting Tarantino dialogue. It's nice to see an actor who had shown such promise become such a star alongside a great director. See more reviews at swilliky.com",8,3,18,29 December 2015

On the alien ship is a fossilized life form with a hole in its chest. Kane (John Hurt) peeks over a giant egg and a spider-like creature pops out and hugs his face. Dallas (Tom Skerritt) and Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) bring him back and try to take him back on their ship but Ripley stops them. The science officer Ash (Ian Holm) overrides Ripley and lets them back on the ship. They take Kane and his face-hugging alien to the medical bay but are unable to cut it off because it has acid for blood that melts through the ship. As Ash investigate the new creature, Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) work to repair the ship.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",9,1,2,19 May 2017

Suicide Squad," A mediocre super-villain team-up film
","DC Films adds to the extended comic universe with supervillains, in this shallow action film stuffed full of characters but short on plot. The movie isn't as terrible as the pro critics made it out to be, it's just nothing special that the hype at first made it out to be. It rests somewhere in the middle of superhero films, not joining Deadpool in the subversive revelry, but not as serious a Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice to make it dull and long. It moves along quickly but this doesn't allow viewers to know any of the characters and hardly lets these meta- humans show off their powers. Will Smith carries the film bringing the brightest star power as Deadshot. Margot Robbie is right behind him laughing and spouting off with a strange New Yorker accent that came off kind of weird. Harley Quinn will be one to watch but her relationship with the Joker (Jared Leto) didn't show much chemistry. The rest of the team is regulated for the background, but Viola Davis takes on the lead role as no-nonsense Amanda Waller, though she doesn't make that much of an impression as she could have. The film jumps from scene to scene pushing a villain that looks like an outtake from Gods of Egypt and Cara Delevingne as the archaeologist June Moon possessed by the Enchantress, who starts off looking cool as a horror movie monster but gets washed over with shoddy special effects.The rest of the team leave something to look forward to if they make a sequel like Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and Katana (Karen Fukuhara). Slipknot (Adam Beach) is hardly worth mentioning as a disposable character. Diablo (Jay Hernandez) does have some shining moment, but it's short lived. Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) is the loyal soldier, but his romantic involvement with Moon falls flat as the attempt of emotion in this story.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," One of my favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe movies!
","The second Captain America movie sees Steve Rogers in the present day after the events of the first Avengers. Steve meets Sam Wilson, played by Anthony Mackie, in the park at the start and this friendship proves to be fruitful as he turns out to be the Falcon with a very cool suit of wings that allow him to fly. Captain works missions with S.H.I.E.L.D. and Black Widow, played by Scarlett Johansson, and Brock Rumlow, played by Frank Grillo. There are a lot conspiracy and the movie turns into a political thriller with Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, discovering that Agents of Shield are not to be trusted. He is attacked by the the mysterious Winter Soldier in an awesome car chase, and injured badly. His only hope for help is to turn to Captain America.The action comes in spurts with some very cool scenes. The mystery was intriguing the first time around since I only had a few hints as to where the story was going. The major twist of Hydra infiltrating Shield took me totally off guard. I thought Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce was a pretty cool villain of sorts contributing to the overall force of the twist. Chris Evans looks more comfortable in the lead role and the special effects looked a lot better.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,0,1,4 May 2016
Doctor Strange," Something never seen before, a great addition to Marvel
","The next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe adds a spiritual realm of magic and mysticism. Doctor Strange tells a tale almost wholly separate from the Avengers storyline that had ended in turmoil after Civil War. Steven Strange is played by Benedict Cumberbatch who does a great job as an arrogant neurosurgeon that necessitates a comparison to Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. Strange can do no wrong as he performs complicated surgeries with the help of Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) and speeds down the highway until a gruesome car accident. Director Scott Derrickson does a good job showing the cringy surgeries but avoiding any unnecessary violence.The visuals will be the most memorable part of this film as Strange ventures to Nepal for a cure, he encounters the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and learns about the trippy astral projection. Those scenes are fun and awe-inspiring. I couldn't look away at the stunning effects and will be the reason I watch this film multiple times in the future. Seeing this movie in the theater really transcends the experience and I would highly recommend this movie to Marvel fans. In the end, it is a Marvel movie and takes a lot of the story cues from that even if the shifting New York City is something we haven't seen on screen before.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,3,6,4 November 2016
Interstellar," Strange space travel story that has a silly ending but still an interesting Nolan film
","Christopher Nolan takes on space travel in a scientific thriller. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a scientist and former pilot haunted by his past accidents. He lives with his daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy), son Tom (Timothée Chalamet) and his grandfather Donald (John Lithgow).

Despite a message from the bookshelf to stay, Cooper goes on the mission rocketing into space with Brand, Doyle (Wes Bentley), and Romilly (David Gyasi). Their search for habitable planets takes them through a black hole to a solar system with three potential planets. The biggest complication is gravity and relativity cause for a huge time jump that will change every hour into seven years back on Earth. The first planet is a water planet that has giant tidal waves heading towards their spaceship. Doyle is wiped out by the wave but Brand is saved by the robot. They are stuck on the planet for longer than they had hoped because the engines are waterlogged.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",6,1,1,22 July 2017

Lion," A beautiful story of hope and family
","The beautiful true story of Saroo's search for his missing mother and brother inspires the powerful movie Lion directed by Garth Davis. Young Saroo (Sunny Pawar) works with his brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) to earn money for his family to eat. When he decides to go with his brother to a night job, he ends up trapped on a train that takes him across India, too far away to find his family again but stuck into a system of orphan children. Eventually, he finds his way to adoption and grows up in Australia. The remarkable journey of the young boy takes up the first half of the movie and it so amazing to watch as the boy survives harsh conditions.

After Saroo survives nearly being sold into sex slavery and a harsh orphanage he is finally adopted by an Australian family. John (David Wenham) and Sue Brierley (Nicole Kidman) adopt Saroo and raised him along with his brother Mantosh (Divian Ladwa).

Captain America: The First Avenger," A decent start to a character in the MCU!
","In anticipation of the third installment, I've re-watched the previous to Captain America films. The First Avenger gives the origin story of Steve Rogers. The special effects of Chris Evans as a skinny kid trying to get into the army still look a little odd but I gave this film enough suspension of disbelief to go with the flow. The introduction of Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes was subtle and I did not know the comic book storyline at the time so I did not comprehend his significance in later installments.The first movie gets off to slow start as a lot of back story has to be filled in including Stanley Tucci's character Dr. Erskine, the inventor of the serum that makes Captain America strong, finding Steve and recruiting him to boot camp. Hayley Atwell and Tommy Lee Jones are Agent Carter and Colonel Phillips respectively who are skeptical at first but convert over when they see his strength. Peggy believes in him a little sooner and gives him his first chance to prove his strength.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7,0,0,4 May 2016
The Bourne Ultimatum," Fun but repetitive and formulaic
","The third installment serves as an attempted conclusion to an ongoing series yet suffers by falling into a similar routine of the previous two film. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has vanished from the spotlight after his disappearance six years ago in the epic Russian car chase. A new set of spies seeks to cover up the evil government assassin program when a witness to Bourne's inception leaks information to a reporter, an interestingly prescient scenario. Bourne is still plagued by memories of how he was tortured to mold him into a superhuman, so he contacts the reporter only to discover, the agents are tracking their moves.Ultimatum establishes the signature Bourne chase scene that was so successful the last two films. Matt Damon runs and ducks and occasionally throws explosive stuff behind him to distract and hinder the authorities in their relentless pursuit. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) pops back up and she has fully converted to Bourne's side despite still working for the spy agency. She almost momentarily takes the place of the romantic interest but her role is cut short. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) also returns to assist in the hunt for Bourne.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",5,2,3,26 July 2016
Fargo," One of the Coen Brothers' best films
","The first time viewers were introduced to the strange crime and comedy of Fargo, North Dakota comes from the Coen brothers' brilliant drama. The 'true' story begins in 1987 with Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hiring two criminals, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife. Jerry is trying to get his father Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell) who has a lot of money to pay for a car lot. When Wade agrees to help Jerry out, Jerry tries to stop the wheels from turning on this crime. The two criminals are shown to be very odd, debating over pancakes and having women in the bed right next to each other. This quirkiness is not only a funny aspect of many Coen brothers films but continues in the television show.The criminals break in and kidnap Jerry's wife just as Jerry learns that Wade and his business partners will only give him a finder's fee for his new lot. Carl and Gaear are pulled over by an honest cop who refuses to take a bribe and hears the woman's crying so Gaear shoots him in the head. While Carl disposes of the cop's body, Gaear hunts down pedestrians who see the crime and try to escape. Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets the call to investigate the murders. Since she's pregnant, she almost barfed at the crime scene. As Marge investigates the scene, Jerry works to cover up his crime and keep the police out of it.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,1,2,21 June 2017

Despite the low performance, Popstar is a decently funny film.Sandberg extends a Saturday Night Live skit into Connor4Real, a clueless pop icon on the verge of releasing his second solo album and recording a documentary.

","A spy waking up without any memory is a classic tale, and The Bourne Identity, based on a novel by Robert Ludlum take that premise and runs with it.

Desperate to follow the clues he finds in a bank lockbox, he offers Marie (Franka Potente) twenty thousand dollars to take him to Paris.

Baby Driver," Brilliant, funny, and highly entertaining
","Car chases and music fill the streets of Edgar Wright's fun and action-packed film. In what feels like it could be one of the best movies of the summer, Baby (Ansel Elgort) speeds around Atlanta while listening to music and even when he walks on the streets, he is completely in step with the rhythm. Nothing throws him off as he pulls off a series of heists for the gangster leader Doc (Kevin Spacey). He works with various crews that include hard boiled robbers like Griff (Jon Bernthal), Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza González), and Bats (Jamie Foxx). After the initial chase, Baby has nearly paid back Doc with only one more job required and during the time between he stays at home with his foster dad Joseph (CJ Jones).Baby is starstruck when he sees Debora (Lily James) a waitress at a 24-hour diner. They form a quick bond in scenes that ooze romantic chemistry as both young actors deliver charming performances under the brilliant direction. The music doesn't stop and after Baby helps Doc dispose of a body and finally pays him back, he just can't get away. Doc wrangles him into another job with coercive threats and sends him out to scout their next job, a post office. In a hilarious scene, Doc sends his 8-year-old nephew into to help scope out the bank, adding brilliant humor in a tense scene.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",9,18,34,27 June 2017
Justice League," A decent but standard superhero team up
","The heroes of DC Comics unite in an action-packed adventure that has a mix of tones but some eye-popping action. The expanded universe of superheroes has struggled with recent films doing poorly with critics while having some financial success. The most recent film was a huge hit that seemed to put the connected universe back on track. Justice League does its job moving the characters around and getting them together but a lot of it feels like something that was only half thought out and a copy of something more interesting from another comic book movie company. The action in the film was enjoyable enough for me and seeing new superheroes benefited the overall feel of the film to make it an enjoyable experience for me. Familiar faces return and a new villain adds action though often has poor special effects and corny dialogue.Batman (Ben Affleck) uses the fear of a criminal to draw out a parademon, the footsoldiers of Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds). Bruce Wayne learns that the monsters are seeking out Motherboxes from Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot). She knows the legends and when she is done fighting off religious zealots, she joins Bruce in recruiting new heroes to help in the fight. Bruce heads to an isolated sea village to recruit Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) who turns out to have amazing water powers as Aquaman. Arthur refuses Bruce's offer so Wayne heads to another young protégé Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) who has superspeed powers after a lightning strike turned him into the Flash. Diana Prince tries to recruit Cyborg (Ray Fisher), a football star Victor Stone, who was altered by a Motherbox when his father Silas (Joe Morton) performed experiments on it.

Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) desires to venture into the town for new cures though the elders forbid it. The community thrives on their innocents and simple nature of living, though every few nights, the creatures arrive to threaten their existence and keep them happy to be safe within their walls. The Village elders consist of Edward Walker (William Hurt) the leader, Lucius's mother Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver), a mourning widower August Nicholson (Brendan Gleeson). The issue of not having proper medicine affects all the members of the community and is a major argument for sending someone to the towns for assistance.

The Revenant," An epic adventure and amazing survival tale!
","The powerful story of Hugh Glass's survival in the wilderness based on Michale Punke's book of the same name was depicted beautifully by the genius director Alejandro Inarritu and the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki. Leonardo Dicaprio does a convincing job as the tracker who fell in love with a native woman and struggles to survive. Tom Hardy does exceptionally well as the villain of this picture topping off a great year of performances. Domhall Gleeson and other supporting actors also do a great job.The shots are so beautiful with plenty of panoramic images of the dazzling white wilderness. This movie drives home the idea that the natural world is harsh and unforgiving. Any moment when a character achieves sympathy from the viewer, they are immediately faced with dangerous circumstances and often don't get it out alive. Dicaprio's character Glass goes through an especially harsh time with a brutal attack from a bear that continues on even after the uncomfortable level has passed. The director did a great job showing Glass's recovery while still escaping from a war party of Native Americans.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,0,3,16 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," A Spielberg History Lesson
","I prepared myself for the slow and steady spy-craft of Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies and got to watch another strong performance from Tom Hanks.I was not familiar with this piece of history but apparently this insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan, had quite an effect on U.S. foreign negotiations during the Cold War. I can't help thinking there were some other stories to tell and should do some research on why Spielberg chose this particular story to adapt into a motion picture. There was certainly historical significance to the events depicted and I alway like to be made to think and to learn. It looked beautiful, shots, scenery, costumes, but I did notice it was just a bunch of white guys for the most part and a few minor roles for woman. I have been reading Hollywood has a problem with that but it's not like this movie set out to change that and I guess they were just displaying the times. There were also some great supporting performances by Mark Rylance, as Russian spy Rudolf Abel, and Amy Ryan, who played Donovan's wife and was also the mother in the recent Goosebumps movie. Someone should give her a leading role. I liked her all the way back in The Wire. Scott Shepherd was also good as a CIA agent.This movie hinges on Hanks performance and I had no doubt he would deliver. He especially excels in the final climactic scenes. I liked this movie but it was also a bit slow and doesn't necessarily need to be seen in theaters. This is the fourth collaboration between Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg after Saving Private Ryan (one of the greatest war movies ever), The Terminal (forgettable), and Catch Me If You Can (another great movie).

Split," Mediocre Shyamalan film dependent on past success
","M. Night Shyamalan takes on mental illness in his latest thriller. James McAvoy plays the character Kevin and his multiple inhabitants in an impressive performance. Unfortunately, McAvoy performance is the only part of the film worth watching. I will be spoiling the end of this film but since it hardly affects the actual story, I wouldn't worry too much about spoiling the experience. I was under the impression that Shyamalan was striking out on a new path of successful thrillers but the ending of this one relies too heavily on past success. Under on of the influence of his personality known as Dennis, McAvoy's Kevin kidnaps three young women, Marcia (Jessica Sula), Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), and loner Casey (Anya Taylor- Joy). The three women don't do much to fight back against their captor and Casey refuses to cooperate with the other two for fear of the extra strong Dennis.

Spider-Man," A now classic superhero film that set a standard for the genre
","Spider-man is my favorite superhero and the films really brought him to life in various forms. I am a fan of almost every cinematic representation but the initial film truly brought the hero to life for me. I remember seeing this film on opening day back in 2002 after anticipating it for months. The film begins with a voice-over narration by Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) as he's just a dorky high school kid though a brilliant mind who reads research on nanotechnology. He's late to catch the bus for a field trip to a spider research facility and is tripped when caught staring at his crush Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Also attending the trip is the wealthy high school kid Harry Osborn (James Franco) who is a disappointment to his father Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). While taking a picture of Mary Jane, Peter is bitten by a genetically modified super spider. Norman Osborn works at Oscorp to develop a glider, an exoskeleton suit, and a super soldier performance-enhancing serum but risks losing funding without successful human trials. At Peter's home, Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) worry about their financial stability and Peter who comes home sick. Norman moves ahead with the human trial testing it on himself but it drives him crazy and he kills a researcher. Peter wakes up to find he has strange power like better eyesight, a ripped body, faster reflexes, and a strange webbing coming out of his wrists. When the bully Flash Thompson (Joe Manganiello) tries to fight him, Peter easily outmaneuvers him and punches him across the hall. He begins to experiment with his newfound abilities, crawling, jumping and swinging around buildings. The oddest thing about this film is the natural web shooting out of his arms, which at first, I thought wasn't so strange but didn't realize this was not the original way it was written in the comics.

Dunkirk," A grand scale war film from Christopher Nolan
","Christopher Nolan depicts the great effort to evacuate British soldiers during the early part of World War II in his latest film. With Dunkirk surrounded, the soldiers try to flee on battleships but planes continue to drop bombs and sink them. The story plays out in three parts and three timelines, the first story 'The Mole' plays out over a week on the beach, the second 'The Sea' in one day, and 'The Air' in one hour. The soldier Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) tries to escape the beach any way he can from carrying the sick to hiding in an abandoned craft. He teams up with a silent soldier Gibson (Aneurin Barnard) to carry a wounded man aboard a destroyer but then they are both ordered off the ship so hide below the dock. They hear Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) and Colonel Winnant (James D'Arcy) discuss the situation on the beach. On a dock back in England, Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and his son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) see the Royal Navy commandeering boats so they decide to set sail themselves to help the truth bringing along young George (Barry Keoghan).In the air, Farrier (Tom Hardy) and Collins (Jack Lowden) fly towards the beach. Their greatest worry beyond the enemy planes is fuel, especially when Farrier's gauge breaks. The two pilots take down enemy planes with stunning scenes of air battle, probably the best part about watching the film in theaters. Back on the beach, Timothy and Gibson escape a sinking ship and help soldiers out of the water. They venture to another ship where they allowed on board and given tea and toast. Gibson does not go below deck but Timothy goes with Alex (Harry Styles) to eat the food. When a torpedo hits that ship, the men scramble to swim above the surface and Gibson saves their lives by opening the door so they can swim out. Mr. Dawson picks up a soldier (Cillian Murphy) shivering on a sunken U-Boat. The soldier desperately wants to not go back to the beach at Dunkirk having seen what happened.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,2,7,23 July 2017

","Rebooting the franchise and telling a similar yet different story, the Amazing Spider-Man adds a new face to the main character and fills in an alternate backstory. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is orphaned at a young age when his parents disappear under mysterious circumstances and leave with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). Peter grows into a brilliant high school student and photographer, obsessed with his missing parents.

Aliens," An amazing sci-fi action spectacle and perfect sequel
","The slimy terrors in outer space return in this larger more action-packed sequel that rivals the original as a great sci-fi film. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is picked up 57 years later floating in space in her cryo-sleep. She is informed that a colony has been set up on the planet and it has recently gone silent. At the request of Weyland Corp. employee Burke (Paul Reiser), Ripley agrees to tag along on a mission with the colonial marines who hope to find out what happened to the colony. The marines are skeptical of what Ripley describes as a menacing force capable of taking out a whole crew, especially Private Hudson (Bill Paxton) and Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein). Ripley is also wary of the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen) after her encounter from the previous film.The squad heads down to the planet and finds the colony abandoned. There are signs of the aliens and only one survivor Newt (Carrie Henn). Led by Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews), the marines trace the colonialists' trackers to the energy facility of the terraforming structure. They have to give up their weapons so as not to blow the place up, a handicapping that I always thought reduced the action for this part of the film. Lt. Gorman (William Hope) gives the order and Apone collects all the ammo and grenades. Vasquez and Private Drake (Mark Rolston) keep a clip on them. Of course, the team gets caught off guard and slaughtered leaving only a few left alive including Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn).Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",9,5,7,20 May 2017
The Fast and the Furious," A decent action movie that sparks a huge series
","The movie that started it all follows a pretty generic plot and doesn't have the best action or acting, but is a passable film to build a franchise off of. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is an undercover cop trying to infiltrate a gang of street racers led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel). Brian flirts with Mia (Jordana Brewster), Dom's sister, and clashes with the gang of street racers, especially Vince (Matt Schulze). The rest of Dom's gang including Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Jesse (Chad Lindberg), and Leon (Johnny Strong) are more accepting of Brian's presence in the group. Brian loses a race to Dom but helps him elude the police to gain his trust. Owing him a car, the two work to build a new car as Brian investigate a string of truck robberies. He suspects that the criminals are led by a rival racer Johnny Tran (Rick Yune). Sgt. Tanner (Ted Levine) and Agent Bilkins (Thom Barry) push Brian to look at Toretto as his bond with the team grows. They build a fast car that they plan to use in the upcoming street racing competition know as Race Wars. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",5,0,1,13 April 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A great time travel X-men movie!
","The best-reviewed installment in the X-Men, Days of Future Past combined everything that the X-men franchise has been building up to in all of the previous movies. The film combined the cast of First Class with those still alive after the original trilogy. Placing Hugh Jackman's Wolverine in the middle, this time-travel story juggled a tale of the 1970s mutant uprising with a post- apocalyptic story of the remaining mutants hiding from the vicious sentinels. The continuity went completely out the window, and I remember that confusing me throughout my first viewing of this film. It wasn't until I purchased the movie and rewatched it that I realized that it was a film made to just go with the flow. There is another Rogue Cut still out there that I have yet to see but I hope one day I may get to see the deleted scenes. The original version feels like a film where a little too much was left on the editing room floor.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,0,0,26 May 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Full of superheroes but an exciting start to Phase 3 of the MCU
","There is a lot of superheroes in a Captain America: Civil War, so much so that the movie can barely contain it, but somehow it is pulled off to make an enjoyable, action-packed adventure and kick off the new phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I need to make a list so I remember: starting with Captain America there is also Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Winter Soldier, Hawkeye, Vision, War Machine, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Spiderman and of course Iron Man. The movie is packed but the plot was brisk only slowing down to explore the complex issue of the Sokovia Accord.The movie begins with the villain Crossbones played by Frank Grillo returning from the second film. He was in it for only a short amount of time but there are plenty of heroes to fill the void. The Vision and Scarlet Witch are forming a relationship that was shown in the Avengers: Age of Ultron. This movie is really a sequel to the Avengers and adds even more to the mix though it leaves off Thor and Hulk for a later film.

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A mediocre prequel
","J.K. Rowling is unable to leave the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and continues to put out ever expanding stories with a sequel play reviewed here and now the prequel movie series. The overlong titled Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them comes from a textbook that Harry Potter read in his years at Hogwarts.

Saw III," Making the series a trilogy but a low point of the film franchise
","Moving the franchise into a trilogy, the third brutal torture horror film explains a bit more how Jigsaw pulls off the sick games while showing even more gore. The film begins with Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) breaking his leg in an attempt to escape captivity. Detective Kerry (Dina Meyer) searches for Eric but she also falls victim to Jigsaw's awful torture. The main story consists of John Kramer (Tobin Bell) and his pupil Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith) kidnapping a surgeon Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh) in order to keep John alive. Jigsaw wants to oversee one last game before he finally passes away so attaches a deadly necklace to Lynn's neck that has shotgun cartridges all around it and will go off if John's heart rate stops.The test revolves around Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) who must go through a series of awful tortures. He lost his son in a drunk driving accident and has never recovered. His first test is to help the woman who witnessed his son's death, Danica (Debra McCabe), from freezing to death. She is hung up naked in a frozen locker and has water sprayed on her periodically unless Jeff grabs a key. He burns his cheek grabbing the key but doesn't save her in time.

The Conjuring 2," A terrific and terrifying horror sequel!
","I was greatly impressed with this horror sequel, nothing entertained and frightened me this much in a long time. As far as sequels go, especially horror sequels, this movie is beyond comparison. There are some very minor flaws of special effects but these take nothing away from the terror and the great story of the Warrens' next adventure.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga return as Ed and Lorraine Warren and are more comfortable in their roles as the paranormal investigators. The story begins with a short recounting of their most famous case, the Amityville house. This sets up the spooky demonic nun that has graced the trailers for the last few weeks. This nun is freaky and will haunt my nightmares for the next few nights. The Warrens have garnered some respect for their work but also have to face more skeptics. Lorraine as has to deal with premonitions of her husband's death. It takes a while but eventually the couple is summoned to London for a new mission. James Wan does a terrific job with the camera work showing just enough to have viewers squirming in their seats before the boom and jump scares. He ratchets up the tension and tells a story that does justice to the original and true story this event was based on. The dark hallways and the flooded basement are a perfect setting for the hauntings. I hope that Wan returns to the horror genre after Aquaman because he has the formula down and has developed a great talent for this type of filmmaking.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,1,4,9 June 2016
Resident Evil," A rough start to the video game adaptation franchise
","The video game adaptation sparks a franchise that has soldiered for five sequels. The first film begins with the hive of the Umbrella Corp under a lockdown as a virus spreads through the facility. Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up with a blurry memory inside a mansion. She encounters Matt (Eric Mabius) who claims to be part of the police force when they are captured by a military team. The leader of the team is One (Colin Salmon) who is taking them from the mansion deep underground to stop the evil rogue AI, the Red Queen, beneath Raccoon City. Alice also has memories of being married to Spence (James Purefoy). She teams up with Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) after most of the team is eliminated by a laser beam hallway. The movie turns into a typical zombie movie from that point on with cheap special effects and over the top action common for a movie directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. Audiences have been spoiled with zombie gore since this film was released and this is nowhere near one of the top in this subgenre of horror. The special effects are pretty flimsy and dated too.

Independence Day," ID4 was fun in 1996 and still decent 20 years later
","The highest grossing movie of 1996 was the alien invasion blockbuster directed by Roland Emmerich. Independence Day featured the destruction of national monuments including the White House and the Empire State Building. Will Smith stars as Captain Steven Hiller, a fast- talking and even faster-flying fighter pilot alongside Jeff Goldblum, who was coming off of the 1993 highest grossing movie Jurassic Park, as the cable guy David Levinson.From the first shot of an alien spaceship hovering over the moon toward Earth, this movie set a precedent for iconic invasion imagery. Bill Pullman plays President Whitmore, a retired fighter pilot. Pullman does a decent job as a president out of his depth with this new threat. He also delivers the most memorable speech prior to the final spaceship versus jets battle scene.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7,0,0,25 June 2016
Batman Begins," Reflecting back on the start of the Dark Knight trilogy before the new version!
","The first of what is now known as the Dark Knight trilogy directed by Christopher Nolan sought to reboot the franchise that had already had four movies before it. There was a marked difference in this franchise as other superhero franchises were starting up but this story was taking more of a realistic, dark, and gritty approach to the comic book character. Christian Bale played Bruce Wayne as he grows into the Dark Knight. The story is told through flashbacks with a young Bruce Wayne played by Gus Lewis. The parts in the past were slow but they were separated by the training Bruce goes through under Liam Neeson's Ducard. I thought the training was interesting and set up the hallucinogenic chemical that would be used in later acts.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7,0,1,22 March 2016
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," An exciting reboot of a nearly fifty-year old franchise
","Using awe-inspiring motion capture technology, this reboot takes a fresh new look at the franchise and creates a remarkable start to a trilogy. Chimps are captured in the jungle and brought to a research facility where Will Rodman (James Franco) researches Alzheimer's. Due to an incompetent worker Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine), a chimp, named Bright Eyes due to the green eyes that are a symptom of the heightened intelligence, escapes and is brutally killed scaring off investors before human trials. Franklin and Will discover a baby chimp in Bright Eye's cage. Franklin convinces Will to take the ape so he doesn't have to put it down. Will returns home where he cares for his father Charles (John Lithgow) who suffers from Alzheimer's and names the chimp Caesar (Andy Serkis). The baby already exhibits advanced intelligence and grows smarter over the next three years. Charles's condition worsens during the same three years until Will brings home a sample of the drug. Charles almost immediately recovers as Caesar finds himself in trouble with the neighbors. Caesar is injured so Will takes him to a vet at the zoo, Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto).

Caesar reacts poorly to being in captivity and the harsh treatment from Dodge.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",6,0,0,15 July 2017
Beasts of No Nation," One of the best films of 2015
","I guess it's time to start talking about awards season with this new amazing film Beasts of No Nation directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga starring Idris Elba and newcomer Abraham Attah, the powerful child lead. Though I am glad Netflix is entering the arena of producing major motion pictures, I wish there was a theater near me that was brave enough to show this film because this movie deserves viewing on a large screen. As it was on Netflix, I often paused it and did other things before coming back to it because life is busy, not because this film ever lost my interest. The Revenant is going to have to be one amazing film to compete with this masterpiece.This story needs to be told and I applaud Netflix for taking this brave step, not only in cinema distribution but in the topic at hand. Abraham Attah plays the young boy Agu and almost immediately reveals himself to be a talented, charismatic young actor. I am curious to see the behind-the-scenes to see how he handled such complicated shots and intense sets. I've heard some amazing stories about the filming but that the film fell heavily on this young man's shoulders and he pulled it off so well is really a credit to everyone involved and should signal a bright future for Mr. Attah as actor if that is his pursuit. His voice-over pleas to God throughout are chilling.Idris Elba delivered another powerful performance, something we've all come to expect and possibly take for granted. At this point, it's his supporting actor award to lose and I'm not sure what other performance has generated as near enough buzz to compete. Surely not Seth Rogen but I should catch Steve Jobs later this week so we'll see. As the Commandanat, Mr. Elba has the opportunity for powerful speeches and intensely personal scenes and he plays them all like a true professional. I am rooting for him to go all the way with this one.As for the plot, this movie is so harsh and unrelenting and Fukunaga's camera style captures every detail with his signature tracking shots and tragically powerful images that give you no place to hide from the violence that plays out on screen. This was a great follow up choice to True Detective for this director. I don't know what the reception will be for this film over time as it has taken such an unorthodox way to be distributed but I do believe this is the future of cinema and theaters will have to adjust. It is really telling that such a powerful film serves as the pioneer for the popular streaming service. I hope it does receive the recognition and accolades it deserves.",9,11,14,25 October 2015
Get Out," An entertaining horror culture commentary
","Jordan Peele has crossed over from comedy into the horror genre though he keeps plenty of the humor from his stint on the popular Comedy Central show. Peele directs this thriller about a black man Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) who travels to visit the parents of white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). Her parents Missy (Catherine Keener) and Dean (Bradley Whitford) Armitage act pretty strange but assure Chris that they are not racist and approve of the interracial couple. Rose's brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) is aggressive toward Chris and all- around a creepy dude.Chris is trying to quit smoking and Missy offers to hypnotize him to help him stop, but at first he refuses. Chris also notices that the maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) acts really strange and the groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson) also acts standoffish and weird towards Chris. The parents inform Chris that they'll be having a gathering of neighbors and friends. Chris describes the situation to his friend caring for his dog Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery) who warns against the strange behavior of these wealthy white people.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,8,18,1 March 2017
Room," Brie Larson is great, and Jacob Tremblay as well, Sad Movie
","I had picked Brie Larson as the favorite to win the best actress this year and she might juts pull it off though this movie has an anticlimactic ending that doesn't explore the full extent of the horrible events depicted. Room is based off a book by the same name written by Emma Donoghue. The novel won all sorts of awards and shortlisted for many others. I have not had the privilege to read it but I've heard good things. Donoghue also adapted the screenplay. The significance of this movie cannot be denied as I clearly remember hearing the horrifying tale of the three women in Cleveland and the other awful experiences of young woman at the hands of derange men. This movie takes place in Ohio too. Overall this movie is very sad and moving, a real downer. Jack played by Jacob Tremblay steals the show. I'm surprised he didn't get nominated for a Golden Globe. His young performance was only outdone by the young man of Beasts of No Nation, Abraham Attah. This doesn't take away from Tremblay's performance. He dominates the film and his voice-over brings us into the strange world of room. The back and forth between him and Larson's Joy, or Ma, was real and grew steadily nerve-wrecking as they plan their escape.See the rest of this review and more at swilliky.com",7,4,10,17 December 2015
The Bourne Legacy," The franchise is out of steam
","The Bourne Legacy works more as a spin off to the successful Bourne trilogy using events from Supremacy and Ultimatum to inform the developments in this film. The story focuses on Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), a super soldier in a secret CIA training camp up in Alaska. While the CIA tries to clean up its mess through Col. Eric Byer (Edward Norton), they begin feeding their soldiers in the field poisonous pills. For a brief time, Cross encounters another soldier (Oscar Isaac) and is pursued by drones.The addition of the U.S.'s preferred means of engagement in flying drones enhances the action to a modern level but somehow, this spin off still falls short. Scott Glenn reprises his role as the CIA official Ezra Kramer scrambling to cover up the damage caused by Jason Bourne. The pacing is a bit off with short scenes of action and convoluted story that tries to recap the first three films and set up the new plot. A new senior official lurking in the shadows Adm Mark Turso (Stacy Keach) heads the cover-up operation. The scientists behind the program get involved including Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who witnesses an awful mass murder playing off other horrific current events. The movie also pauses to inform us of the backstory through flashbacks, which stalls the fast-paced nature viewers expect from a Bourne film. Corey Stoll also shows up as agent Zev Vendel, a minor role prior to his rise to fame to the point of a Marvel villain.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",3,0,3,27 July 2016

","Before I was born, Ghostbusters became the great franchise that is now being rebooted over thirty years later. I saw this film multiple times in my childhood and recently caught it again at a special event showing at my local theater. The original film has a great mixture of comedy and goofy spooks to make it the classic that is still enjoyable to watch today.After a brief ghost sighting, the film introduces Bill Murray's cocky and flirtatious Dr. Peter Venkman. Running wild in the psychology department, Venkman doesn't take his job serious but his fellow professors Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis). Together they investigate the paranormal sightings only to find themselves cast out of their college and in need of starting their own private business.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7,3,3,15 June 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A decent film but shows the series has grown stale
","The pirates return for one last swashbuckling adventure that resolves a few outstanding plot threads from the previous film. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is down on his luck still a whole bank instead of just the safe inside. Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) is the son of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and hopes to reverse the curse his father is under by finding the trident of Poseidon. He works aboard a British vessel until the crew is killed by dead men led by Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) who wants revenge on Jack Sparrow. Also looking for the trident is Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), a brilliant young woman accused of being a witch.After the bank heist, Jack loses his crew because all of the gold fell out of the safe. He wonders through the streets drunkenly and trades the magic compass for a bottle of rum. This trade frees Salazar and his crew from their prison, allowing them to sail at daylight and take over the seas. Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) was the leader of the seas until Salazar started killing his crew and sinking his ships. A ruthless British officer Scarfield (David Wenham) imprisons Jack and Carina, sentencing them to execution. Barbossa goes to the real witch Shansa (Golshifteh Farahani) to understand what Salazar desires.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",6,2,6,29 May 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," A great addition to the X-Men franchise!
","I enjoyed this latest installment of the X-Men series. Apocalypse delivers with great action and an entertaining story throughout. The special effects were breathtaking and the story engaging. I've contemplated what resulted in the bad reviews and can only think that people demanded too much from the film. For me, it was a fun ride and a nice next chapter in the growing, repeating universe of mutants.Set in 1983, the story first flashes back to ancient Egypt when Apocalypse tried to transfer his body to a healing mutant that is similar to Wolverine. Oscar Isaac, who I enjoy in pretty much every role, plays the eponymous villain. He's mostly dressed up but he is dominating and frightening as he brings about destruction in the world. He recruits his four horsemen, including Psylocke, played silently by Olivia Munn, Storm, played by a new talent Alexandra Shipp, Angel, played by Ben Hardy. Magneto rounds out the four, Michael Fassbender returns as Eric Lensherr. He continues to be brooding but it's the same character we've seen in the two previous films.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7,9,18,26 May 2016

Yondu (Michael Rooker) the alien that first abducted Peter Quill is also after the orb. The group encounters Drax (Dave Bautista) a muscle bound criminal who wants to murder Ronan for killing his family. The group escapes the prison, and Gamora takes them to the Collector (Benicio Del Toro) to sell the orb. It is revealed that inside the orb is an Infinity Stone, likely the Power Stone, capable of destroying the galaxy.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",10,0,3,6 May 2017

Jurassic World," Bad Jurassic Park Sequel
","I love the first one and the second is OK. The third is the worst Now that the fourth is coming to digital release, I thought I would write a review. The only thing worth watching in this poor excuse for a Jurassic Park sequel is Chris Pratt, but even his performance is weak for what we know he can do in Guardians of the Galaxy. I thought he was also pretty funny in Parks and Recreation but he couldn't save this movie. Bryce Dallas Howard is gorgeous but her character is so shallow and goes through such a quick change to lose all credibility by the end. I'm sure enough people have commented on the high heels and running from a T-Rex that I don't need to add to it, but yea, bad. The ending was so illogical with the giant fish monster coming up and snapping the 'bad' big, smart dinosaur just felt forced. I really wanted to like this movie from all the hype and I could've forgiven the rich guy crashing his helicopter just for the cool flashy popcorn movie excitement but then came the kids. Ty Simpkins wasn't so bad in Iron Man 3 and I thought he was great in Insidious, but they really sacrificed his part when they rushed to produce this. The whole starting up a Jeep after twenty or so years, what? These kids didn't come off as that clever, mostly annoying. It was bad overall but better than the Jurassic Park 3.",4,4,11,1 October 2015
Silence," An extraordinary Scorsese film on faith and culture
",Martin Scorsese has made a powerful film about the power of faith and the struggle between conflicting cultures. This epic story tells of the journey of two priests who come to Japan to find their lost teacher. Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) are the two young priests that venture to hostel Japan. They have received news that their teacher Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has apostatized against the Christian faith. They do not believe the rumors and determine that they will travel to Japan to retrieve their father and discover the truth while spreading the gospel.The brutal torture of Japanese Christians is revealed early and continues throughout the film making this a movie that could be difficult to watch for some. The Inquisitor (Issei Ogata) persecutes the faithful with elaborate tactics that conspire to bring out the worst in humans. They provide religious tests like stepping on an image of Christ or spitting on a cross to weed out the Christians. They put the citizens to death making the priests doubt their mission and put out a bounty for the priests' capture. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com,8,3,6,27 January 2017
The Dark Knight," My favorite superhero movie!
","One of my favorite movies ever and my favorite superhero movie, The Dark Knight shows the potential of a Batman movie. The film has some flaws but those are easily glossed over with the brilliant performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker, for which he won an Academy Award. Christian Bale returns to play the Batman and though this movie continues the story that started with Batman Begins, it feels like a wholly separate film that stands easily on its own. The movie starts with a very cool robbery scene. I remember this scene being released early to build excitement and I watched it several times. It introduced the villain in a very cool way and showed his craziness from his first reveal. The story of Gotham continues in the wake of the appearance of Batman. It draws from the phase of the comics that I am more familiar with in that Batman has been practicing his crime fighting for a while and most criminals are scared.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",10,0,1,24 March 2016
Everest," Hopeless Adventure Picture
","There were some decent performances from Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin but mostly this film was pretty forgettable. I did like the beautiful shots of the massive mountain but didn't get that sense of vertigo that I was hoping for. This did not compare to the IMAX experience of Into Thin Air. I only saw it on XD 3D but still I didn't get a sense that I needed to see it on a bigger screen since it wasn't that impressive. The characters were interesting at first and they did a decent job giving them background to generate sympathy for later. However, once they got to the top it seemed frustrating as an audience member that their ill-prepared venture wasn't foreshadowed more. I thought these guys knew what they were doing. The treat for this film were small roles for Jake Gyllenhall and Sam Worthington again. The ads and positive buzz brought me in but I wouldn't recommend this too highly to anyone.",6,1,2,27 September 2015

Saw," Gruesome and terrifying but with a clever story and twist
",This clever horror film set off one of the more gruesome and disturbing horror franchise to date that found a ton of success in its run and has sparked a new film to be released this Halloween. James Wan's gory mystery begins with two men waking up in a room with no idea how they got there. Adam Faulkner-Stanheight (Leigh Whannell) finds a tape in his pocket along with a dead body in the center of the room. He reasonably freaks out as his leg is chained to pipes. The other man in the room Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) is also chained to pipes and has a tape in his pocket. The dead man in the middle of the room has a tape recorder in one hand and a gun in the other. Adam drags the tape recorder and listens to his tape that tells him he is going to die. Dr. Gordon's tape threatens his wife and children if he does not kill Adam by a certain time.Dr. Gordon knows of this modus operandi as he was the suspect in a similar murder case. Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover) and Detective Steven Sing (Ken Leung) investigate a string of brutal murders where the victims were forced to perform ridiculous tasks that usually resulted in them dying or being so traumatized that survival was difficult. Lawrence Gordon's penlight was discovered at a scene so he was brought in for questioning. The doctor had to admit he was having an affair to establish an alibi. He is kept on as a consultant and hears more about the sickening murders.

Don't Breathe," An intense horror film
","Horror movies continue to impress as Don't Breathe arrives to finish off late summer at the movies. This thriller follows three criminals who break into houses until they break into the wrong one. Rocky (Jane Levy) just wants to escape crumbling Detroit to a life in California, but she needs one more score to have enough cash to leave. Her boyfriend, Money (Daniel Zovatto) hears about a blind veteran who received a large sum of money from a settlement after his daughter died in a car accident. Alex (Dylan Minnette) uses his dad's security guard keys to gain access to houses though this particular location proves more difficult with a vicious dog and an inordinate amount of locks.Stephen Lang is ferocious as the blind man with dark secrets of his own. Lang stalks through the house creating a horrifying villain without any supernatural help.The acting was great from the three main actors. Dylan Minnette has graduated from the young Goosebumps film to a more adult horror and I hope he continues work in the genre. Jane Levy has shown promise with her appearance in Evil Dead and looks to have a bright future as a young actress. Fede Alvarez directs the film brilliantly with amazing cinematography to enhance the terror.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,2,6,30 August 2016

","Disney's latest live-action adaptation is the musical romance, Beauty in the Beast. Using stunning and gorgeous special effects, the story of Belle (Emma Watson) and her imprisonment by and growing affection for the Beat (Dan Stevens) plays out in the same way as the cartoon. A selfish prince is cursed by an enchantress and everyone in his castle is turned into fancy objects. Belle finds herself in a small town gossiped about by the villagers and wooed by the crude hunter Gaston (Luke Evans). Belle's father Maurice (Kevin Kline) is an inventor hoping to sell his wares at the market when he becomes lost in the woods and stumbles upon the enchanted castle.

Sicario," Slow and steadily dark
","Being familiar with Denis Villeneuve's work, I wasn't expecting an action-packed thriller but a slow, tense, mounting drama that leaves questions long after the viewing. I was not disappointed. Emily Blunt is one of my favorite actresses and her character was great. She should probably get nominated for her descent into the dark underbelly of CIA and Juarez. I also enjoy seeing both Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin in any film so their duo of CIA contractors (or whatever) was fun to see on screen. The violence starts early and I can't remember another film since Traffic that has depicted the violence of the drug war so explicitly. The extraction of the key witness and the resulting highway shoot out was intense. Jon Bernthal makes a surprising cameo,which was one of the best parts. The cinematography was beautiful, such amazing shots. However, I do think Benicio stole the show and it is more about him than Emily's character despite what I picked up from the previews. This will be in the top ten movies of the year unless some surprises. Another great part was the subplot of Silvio with Maximiliano Hernandez (who I recognized from the Marvel Univers). It really showed the drugs wars effect on families.",8,1,5,3 October 2015
Jack Reacher," A fun Tom Cruise character thriller
","When a mysterious man (Jai Courtney) brutally shoots five people in broad daylight outside PNC Park, the accused man Barr (Joseph Sikora) request that detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) contact Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). Reacher shows up to investigate the murders and find out if Barr is guilty as he once helped him escape justice for a similar murder spree when he served in the military. Jack was a respected military cop who dropped off the grid only to resurface for this investigation. The movie is based on the novel 'One Shot' by Lee Child. Sadly, the gruesome murder feels all too familiar in the troubled times we live in and adds impact to the nature of the investigation. Barr's lawyer Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) employs Reacher to help her discover the truth behind the victims and the killer. Pike and Cruise work well together as Cruise embodies the cavalier charm of Reacher and Pike plays the incredulous and standoffish lawyer who needs Reacher's expertise. The conspiracy grows deeper as the plot thickens and viewers witness both the mystery solving and the villain's plot.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",5,1,2,19 October 2016

The open credits see Groot dancing while the rest fight. Drax establishes himself as the funniest but the whole film is full of great humor and levity to balance out the space action and emotion.

The Da Vinci Code," A mediocre thriller adaptation
","Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code is brought to life under the direction of Ron Howard. Tom Hanks stars as the renowned symbologist Robert Langdon who is called to the Louvre to solve a murder mystery. Paul Bettany plays the devout albino assassin, Silas. The murdered curator leaves behind a set of clues that Langdon must solve in order to discover an ancient secret left behind by the artist Leonardo Da Vinci.

The symbologist and cryptologist together elude capture and travel throughout Paris as the clues lead them towards a greater mystery.Eventually, they encounter a scholar, Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) who reveals the secrets that Da Vinci hid. These revelations may not be historically accurate but the conspiracy is intriguing enough to have achieved the popularity of the novel and film.

Thor," Mediocre film, weaker MCU character
","Adding a third superhero to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and expanding it into a fantasy realm, this mediocre Marvel film was one of the first I felt really disappointed with after leaving the theater though I have learned to appreciate parts of it. Astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) waits for an event with her assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Denning) and fellow scientist Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) when chaos rains down from the sky and Jane hits a man, Thor (Chris Hemsworth). The film jumps back with a monologue from Odin (Anthony Hopkins) lectures his two son, Thor and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), about the dangers of the frost giants and the wonders of Asgard. Thor is quick to violence while Loki is more crafty but Odin can only promote one to king. He chooses Thor but during his ceremony to receive the crown, the frost giants invade and try to steal a powerful weapon. Odin's security proves too powerful but Thor is angry the Jotunheim even attempted something so brash.Thor stews but his friends Vostagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Fandral (Josh Dallas), and Siff (Jaimie Alexander) discouraged him from doing anything. Loki, however, encourages Thor to disobey Odin with trickier and go to Jotunheim. Thor decides to fight back but must use the Bifrost guarded by Heimdall (Idris Elba) who is upset the frost giants were able to sneak by him. The group is transported to Jotunheim where Thor challenges King Laufey (Colm Feore). A battle is almost avoided but Laufey insulted Thor. The friends fight the frost giants including a giant dog beast that Thor flies through the mouth of and out the back of its head. Odin shows up to rescues the group as Frandral is injured but war has been declared. Enraged with Thor's actions, Odin banishes him to Earth and separates him from his hammer.

He asks the strange man to read a scene with him and Tommy invites him to a restaurant to read a scene in front of the other patrons.

American Made," A solid biopic of cartel lore and the American government's schemes
","I just spent about an hour searching for a song in a trailer that I don't believe exists and it could be the last song in the film but I have no idea and it is driving me crazy. Anyways, Tom Cruise's latest romp as a wild pilot smuggling weapons for the American Government and drugs for the Columbian cartel among committing other crimes is a fun and informative piece of cinema. The story of Barry Seal (Cruise) is so wild and under the direction of Doug Liman, American Made captures this insanity for a fast-paced two hours of history. The story of Seal is not a triumphant one but he does have massive success during his life. The film doesn't last too long on the consequences of a life of crime and spends ample time on the benefits. I liked a lot of the film, though the later parts of the film felt a like it lost some steam.The story begins with Seal bored at his job as a pilot for TWA. He's flying all night and unable to spend any time with his wife Lucy (Sarah Wright) because he falls asleep when he gets home. He makes money on the side smuggling cigars until a CIA agent Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson) offers him a new job. His first assignment for the CIA is to take over a private company known as Independent Aviation Consultants, IAC, a not so subtle anagram of CIA. He flies over various countries in South America taking pictures of rebel camps and delivering cash to spies like Noriega for intelligence. These scenes are fun as Tom Cruise howls and the plane takes on gunfire from rebel machine guns. He finds success at his work but keeps up a lie to Lucy that he still works for TWA so the financial constraints weigh on Seal.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7,2,5,2 October 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Fails to live up to the original with a muddled plot
","The Transformers return for a lackluster, poorly written sequel that still has some stunning visuals. The Michael Bay-directed film operates off the premise that the Transformers had come to Earth long ago. In the present, an elite military squad called NEST led by Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sargeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) works with the Autobots to hunt Decepticons. In a destructive battle in Shanghai, Optimus Prime takes down a Decepticon but receives a warning of the Fallen.

Sam has to leave his transformer car Bumblebee behind and say goodbye to Mikaela (Megan Fox) as they start a long distance relationship. He gives her the cube sliver as he departs. The government wants to shut down the Autobots just as the Decepticons plan to revive Megatron. At college, Sam tries to cover up his strange past as he meets his crazy roommate Leo (Ramon Rodriguez). Judy gets high on pot brownies in a moment of humor. Sam starts seeing symbols, an effect from handling the sliver and finds a girl Alice (Isabel Lucas) has taken an interest in him. Bumblebee shows up to take him to Optimus who warns him of a coming war.

The Witch," The Witch is creepy but also confusing
","This New England folktale shows the difficulty of settling a new land, the delusion of blind devotion, and the troubles of an isolated youth. The movie moves slow with brief disturbing scenes to bring the viewer into the plot but overall amounts to a more confusion than actual horror. There are certainly things throughout that will leave viewers cringing in their seats, or on the couch since this film seems to have trouble showing in all theaters and may be more of a rental. The horror is certainly there and the Writer/Director Robert Eggers does plenty to ratchet up the tension but falls short of a complete story.With only a family in the midst of the horror, the characters are a majority of kids with the two parents being Game of Thrones alumni. Kate Dickie plays the mother Katherine who slowly devolves into insanity as her family is slowly picked off by malevolent forces. Ralph Ineson plays the father whose faith is out of control. His deep croaking voice delivers dialogue in such a profound way and worked perfectly in this haunting setting.CHECK OUT MORE OF THIS REVIEW AND OTHERS AT swilliky.com",5,6,13,18 February 2016
Steve Jobs," Fast-paced but Unemotional
","The biopic Steve Jobs starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen and Jeff Daniels, and directed by Danny Boyle is a fast-paced snapshot of three different presentation made by Apple founder and CEO.The performance by Fassbender is easily one of the best of the year. He captures the neurotic, commanding nature of the revolutionary minded Jobs. He had the demeanor and accent down and carried the film throughout.Kate Winslet provided the support as Steve Jobs's adviser, Joanna Hoffman. Winslet delivers another powerful performance and balanced Fassbender's oddness with some down-to-earth no nonsense trying desperately to keep him in line. She had the most emotional parts of the film.Seth Rogen and Jeff Daniels shared the screen momentarily but it all felt too quick to make much of an impression.Though I like the direction, overall I thought Boyle's film felt a bit too rushed and since I've heard some of the production woes, this may have been result of a forced film. The box office does not look positive though it may stick around if it continues to get good word of mouth. I'm not even sure this will make it in my top ten this year though.

Sausage Party," Silly, but nothing special
","The raunchy comedy about grocery store products comes from the minds of Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen who also voices the main sausage, Frank. The story explores the belief in benevolent gods that are human shoppers. The food products believe that these gods take them to a great beyond where they can live out their greatest pleasures and be taken care of by these gods. The movie uses the metaphor of a sausage in buns as sex to the greatest extent possible. The animation boasts an impressive voice cast of all of Rogen's crew including co-creator Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Salma Hayek, Kristen Wiig, Nick Kroll, Danny McBride, Edward Norton, Paul Rudd, James Franco, Craig Robinson, Bill Hader, and plenty more. The story follows the adventure of Rogen's Frank and Wiig's Brenda Bunson, hotdog buns, encounter an enlightened by a raving Honey Mustard (McBride) who was returned after seeing the true story of what really happens when the products are purchased and taken home.The exploration of the grocery store relies heavily on racial stereotypes that are both amusing and insulting simultaneously. The gimmick of talking food is funny at first but runs dry as the movie progresses with an odd story about bath salts. There are plenty of laugh out loud jokes and silly humor, but the story about false beliefs and warring groups of religious zealots is the most interesting part of the comedy.

"Hail, Caesar!"," Great performances and direction as expected from the Cohen brothers!
","The Cohen brothers have another fun and intriguing film with a star-studded cast and even managed to introduce some new faces to the viewing public. The most arresting performance was that of Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix, a fixer or director of physical production for the fiction studio Capitol Pictures. The time period is old Hollywood 1950s and the rise of Communism is a subplot in the film. Brolin really steals the show and adds another great role to his impressive career.Another cast member with a big name draw was George Clooney as an oafish star who ends up captured by a mysterious group known as the future. Clooney thrives as the moron Baird Whitlock and delivers a humorous performance.For more of this review and others check out swilliky.com",6,0,4,7 February 2016
Kong: Skull Island," A mediocre update of a classic for a bigger universe

Saito offers him a chance to return to the United States if he pulls off a complicated job called inception, planting an idea in someone's mind. He heads to Paris where his father Miles (Michael Caine) helps him recruit a new student Ariadne (Ellen Page) to help him build dreams. In a spectacular sequence, Ariadne explores the physics of the dream world but is attacked by Mal as a part of Cobb's self-conscious.

Murder on the Orient Express," Decent mystery from a great author played out by a skilled actor/director
","Kenneth Branagh brings to life Agatha Christie's mystery novel and performs as the clever detective Hercule Poirot. The film begins with Hercule solving a mystery in Jerusalem with his amazing skills before he takes a ship to Istanbul on which he meets Miss Mary Debenham (Daisy Ridley) and Dr. Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom Jr.) who have a secret between them. He needs to return to London for a very important case and there is only one option, the Orient Express. Bouc (Tom Bateman) runs the train so he is able to arrange for Poirot to have a room. The detective is looking forward to a trip without any mysteries to solve so when Edward Ratchett (Johnny Depp) approaches him asking for help against a possible plot to kill him, Poirot refuses. However, when Poirot awakes, they find Ratchett has been stabbed multiple times in his bed. The Orient Express has been stalled by an avalanche so Bouc is desperate to solve the case before the police arrive. Poirot agrees to take the case and begins to interrogate each of the passengers aboard the train and search Ratchett's compartment for clues. The biggest clue is a partially burned note that reveals a connection to the kidnapping of Daisy Armstrong. The film lost me a bit with this leap as Poirot is very familiar with the kidnapping and Ratchett is, in fact, the kidnapper John Cassetti. There was more than one victim as Daisy's mother died from a premature birth and her husband killed himself. The maid was accused and killed herself in police custody as the prosecutor's career was ruined by the false arrest.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",6,1,5,27 November 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Funny and cute, more humor than heart
","The Secret Life of Pets uses the cute, comedic premise that pets have their own lives when humans leave for the day. The story follows Max (Louis C.K.) when his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) brings home a much bigger hound, Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Max was previously living a happy life with Katie and his friend: Gidget (Jenny Slate), Chloe (Lake Bell), Buddy (Hannibal Buress), and Mel (Bobby Moynihan). His life is rudely interrupted by his new roommate so he conspires to get rid of him. The two dogs fight and find themselves accosted by cats then captured by Animal Control.The funniest part of the film is Snowball (Kevin Hart) the white rabbit thrown away by a magician who goes on to lead the legion of flushed pets including gators, cats, lizards, and a tattooed pig. The flushed animals seek revenge against the human race for being discarded and this is the closest the film gets to delivering any sort of message.

Arrival," Beautiful Science Fiction
","A beautiful and ambitious film, Arrival hit theaters this weekend with a remarkable story and stunning visual effects. Based on the short story 'Story of Your Life' by Ted Chiang, this film directed by Denis Villeneuve shows the potential of thoughtful and complex science fiction. Viewers are introduced to Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) as she raises her daughter through a rapid montage that ends in tragedy. The haunting photography from cinematographer Bradford Young adds to the emotional impact.As the story moves ahead, aliens arrive in strange and large pods that can only be entered during certain time intervals. Louise is recruited by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to decipher the alien language and figure out their purpose. With the help of theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), they enter the pod and begin to communicate with the spider or squid-like species. The effects are amazing and awe-inspiring but the story is more personal and touches on themes of language and the development of one's brain during the process of learning. It also explores time and knowledge of the future reflecting on the choices we make and how we perceive the events of our life. This film is an example of great writing meeting great directing with stellar acting on top to make for one of my favorite films of the year that is both moving and entertaining.

The Conjuring," Terrifying and well directed!
","This 2013 horror film has had a great influence on me as a fan of horror. I didn't catch this film in the theaters but in anticipation of the sequel I watched it again right before. This movie is scary. It has one thing that always scares me and that is freaky looking ladies with messed up faces saying all sorts of creepy stuff. The story revolves around the real paranormal investigators Ed and Lorrain Warren. The haunting occurs at the house of the Perrons, a family struggling to get by who thinks they got a deal but found something much worse. The movie is directed by the new horror master James Wan, director of the first two terrifying Insidious films, Saw, Death Sentence, Furious 7, and is signed on to Aquaman. I'm a big fan of his work.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7,0,0,8 June 2016
Scream," Started the 90s horror boom
","Sparking the late 90s campy slasher film boom, Scream terrified audiences in 1996 as Wes Craven puts his hand to serial killers. The meta-movie explores the horror tropes with a certain self-awareness that adds to the horror and inserts comedy, defying the clichés and stating the rules. The story embraces the genre and doesn't shy away from the overly campy nature of a murderer stalking teenage girls in a small town.The story begins with the iconic phone call as young teen Casey (Drew Barrymore) is home alone. The conversation delivers the iconic line 'What's your favorite scary movie?' before diving into dumb victim choices and gore. This murder brings back the media to the town of Woodsboro that experienced a previous flood of reporters a year early with a mysterious murder. Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is still struggling with her mother's death as a new killer stalks her. The film contributed further to the horror genre with the ghostly masked killer who was not an unstoppable force, but stumbling human that could be knocked down and outrun. Surrounding Sydney are potential suspects including her best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan), her lustful boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich), Tatum's boyfriend Stuart (Matthew Lillard), and film buff Randy (Jamie Kennedy). The killer slices through victims including the Principal (Henry Winkler). There are some gruesome deaths including a garaged door, a television, and, of course, a knife.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7,0,0,14 August 2016

X-Men: First Class," One of my favorite X-Men movies!
","After the abysmal X-Men Origins: Wolverine and the middling X-Men: The Last Stand, this mutant superhero franchise was in need of a reboot to restore its dominance for 20th Century Fox. Along comes X-Men: First Class and in celebration of the closing of this new X-Men trilogy, I wanted to revisit the two movies that lead up to X-Men: Apocalypse with the story of Magneto and Professor Xavier.The story begins with Magneto as a child Erik Lensherr as it did in the first X-Men film. Magneto exhibits his mutant talents of controlling metal and in this version, he is tortured by an evil mutant Sebastian Shaw played by Kevin Bacon.

Magneto grows up to be played by Michael Fassbender and seek revenge against his tormentor.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",9,0,1,24 May 2016
Fifty Shades of Grey," A terrible romance from an awful novel
","Based on the popular novel by E.L. James, Fifty Shades of Grey tells the tale of a wealthy billionaire and his lover as they pursue BDSM. Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is tasked with interviewing the wealthy mogul Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) to help her roommate. There is an evident attraction that only grows as Christian shows up in her life continuously and sends her expensive gifts. Anastasia finds his intrusions bizarre but can't help but be attracted to his wealthy lifestyle and multiple talents. The movie is really boring with a plot that plods along spotted with the occasional sex scenes in a bland attempt to engage viewers and I guess appeals to women. The first book was exceptionally awful but I don't think I will ever read the second or continue the series. Grey's behavior is that of a possessive stalker and seems to be able to get away with this behavior because of his wealth and status. Anastasia resists and sees that there is still something good in this man she has come to know. She worries about his past and the older woman who corrupted him in his youth.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",3,0,0,14 February 2017
The Wolverine," A great standalone Wolverine story
","The Wolverine picks up on the story of Logan (Hugh Jackman) after X-Men: The Last Stand and is an improvement on the standalone Wolverine film from his origin story. The movie captures historical context by an introductory flashback to the bombing of Nagasaki where Wolverine is held as a prisoner of war and helps to save the life of a young Japanese soldier from the atomic bomb. The film flashes to Logan having a nightmare about Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who he had killed in the previous film. He has taken to wandering aimlessly in the Canadian wilderness after the tragedy on Alcatraz until a poisoned bear brings him back to civilization. Before Logan can exact revenge on the bear killing hunters, he is stopped by the fortune-teller Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who proposes that he fly with her back to Japan to see the young soldier, now an old mogul Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi). He quickly becomes embroiled in the backstabbing corporate dealing of Yashida's business and is forced to thwart the assassination and kidnapping attempts on Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto).Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7,0,0,4 March 2017
Black Panther," Astounding Marvel Cinematic Universe addition, one of the best!
","This great new addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe manages to distinguish itself from other superhero films with a fresh batch of characters and a memorable villain. In a brief prologue, the history of Wakanda is explained and Prince N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown) is murdered by his brother, the king of Wakanda. In the present day, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns home with Okoye (Danai Guira) after the death of the king of Wakanda in a previous film.

Mother!," A mad metaphorical thriller
","Darren Aronofsky makes intense thrillers and his latest is no  different. I had no idea what to expect from this film only seeing the  cryptic trailer and seeing the film before the reviews. Since its  release, mother! has been the source of opinions ranging from hatred to  adoration. My opinion rests somewhere in the middle as I was  entertained through the whole film and shocked at various moments while  also disturbed and little letdown by the outrageous finale. Thinking  about the film later, my opinion grows more favorable and it is the  kind of film that one would continue to think about days or even weeks  after seeing it. The film borders on horror even having a few jump  scares that I usually enjoy in a film while also just being creepy and  horrific through various scenes.  The film begins with a woman burning and then a man (Javier Bardem)  placing a crystal on a stand. A house magically repairs from fire  damage all through the room until it focuses on a woman (Jennifer  Lawrence) in bed. She wakes up and searches the house. The camera  constantly whirls around staying primarily focused on Lawrence and  hardly ever going outside of the house. Bardem's character is a poet  that can't seem to produce any work or have any affection towards his  doting wife. She works to repair the house as he locks himself in his  room struggling to prevent art. A mysterious orthopedic surgeon (Ed  Harris) arrives at the house, claiming to think this house was a bed  and breakfast, and the poet invites him to stay the night, much to the  woman's chagrin.",7,2,11,16 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A very disappointing start to the DC Universe
","Extremely disappointed with how this movie turned out. It was boring, full of dull scenes that moved a boring, inconsequential plot forward. Batman v Superman did not deliver on the promise of the title and subtitle Dawn of Justice played out on video clips on a computer so it was not something interesting to watch on a big screen. This movie was not visually dazzling or at all entertaining, it was a poor attempt to mimic Marvel's success and failed miserably.I am a fan and anticipated this movie since they first announced it. I prepared by looking back. I didn't cringe too much as details emerged of bad casting and alternating release dates. Even as I watched the movie I held out hope that the tie would turn and the second half would be worth the first half wait, but alas no. This movie didn't even match up to its immediate predecessor in Man of Steel and was the worst version of Batman yet, maybe a little better than George Clooney but equally silly.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",4,8,17,24 March 2016
Blade Runner," A sci-fi classic with large themes
","I wasn't sure which version to choose but landed on the final cut for this review. I remember seeing the film at a much young age but not understanding much of it at the time. I read Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? a few years ago and enjoyed it as I do most of the author's work. The world built in Ridley Scott's film and the novel along with the complex philosophical questions proposed by this work of fiction make this piece of entertainment more engaging than just simple sci-fi or action movie. The film begins with a block of text explaining that the Tyrell Corporation has advanced artificial intelligence to a stage where they are equal if not better than humans. The resulting replicants are used in off- world colonization until a violent mutiny makes them outlaws on the planet Earth. Blade Runners are bounty hunters that hunt down these replicants.The initial scene shows Leon Kowalski (Brion James) undergoing a strange interview about a turtle flipped over in the desert and his memory of his mother when Leon stands up and shoots the interviewer. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is eating noodles when Gaff (Edward James Olmos) picks him up in his flying car. The skyline is enchanting and the visuals in this film are still stunning twenty-five years later. Deckard receives an assignment from Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) over whiskey. Skin-jobs, the derisive term for replicants, have taken over a ship and snuck back on Earth. Deckard refuses because he quit the job of being a blade runner but Bryant threatens him into cooperating. Deckard is given a list of Nexus 6 replicants to hunt down and heads to the Tyrell Corporation headquarters to test the Voight-Kampff machine to see if it can identify a replicant or human.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,0,1,8 October 2017
Trainspotting," A hilarious and harsh look at drug addiction
","The wild tale of a young heroin addict in Scotland, Trainspotting, based on a novel of the same name, makes for a strange and absurd film. Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) and his gang of addicts are stuck in a mindless loop of chasing a high.

Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) has plenty of opinions on pop culture and mocks Renton by quitting at the same time.

Sober, Renton looks for a woman to have sex with and encounters Diane (Kelly Macdonald) who is revealed after a night of love making to be underage. Other gang members have awful nights that including some pretty gross scenarios. Renton only remains off of heroin for a while until he falls back into the deplorable lifestyle. Robbing and corrupting, Renton descends into addiction until they discover Allison (Susan Vidler) screaming. Her child, who had been living in the drug dealer's apartment, is found dead.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great start to a brand new generation and trilogy!
","This review has spoilers. The seventh installment of the Star Wars saga hits the familiar notes of a lost survivor who encounters a droid with pertinent information, in this case a map. The whole story surrounds the search for Luke Skywalker and the cute little rolling droid BB-8 possesses the map given to him by Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron who receives it from a mysterious character played by Max Von Syndow. The first scene gets rolling with laser fights and the force, at least the darkside, used by the masked Kylo Ren. We also see a reluctant stormtrooper. The look feels very new and instead of the male lead, it is Daisy Ridley's Rae. She bounces around a crash Star Destroyer left over from an old Empire versus the Rebellion battle. Rae is waiting for something but we never find out what. This mystery is saved for later installments and thousands of fan theories. Since I know their will definitely be sequels, it doesn't bother me much that they saved some mystery.See more of this review and others at swilliky.com",9,4,21,25 December 2015
Life," Decent sci-fi horror
","Sci-fi horror is an awesome genre and Life is a decent addition with solid alien terror in a claustrophobic space station. The movie begins quickly with the crew of the International Space Station catching a flying vessel that contained samples from Mars. All of the information is relayed through voice-over by Commander Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) to drop us into the plot and get the alien terror rolling. The movie takes a bit to let us know the crew as David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal) deals with being in space for a record amount of time, Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada) celebrates the birth of his child, and scientist Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) experiments and becomes enamored with the alien creature named Calvin. He becomes so obsessed with it that he accidentally breaks quarantine and the alien goes into hibernation.

The fourth wall breaking was fun every once in a while and the awareness of the complications of reboots, spinoffs, and production company franchise struggle over these money machines will land with the movie nerds who paid attention and go over the head of the regular movie goer.The action was top notch though I always want more fighting and explosions and car chases. The fact that there were only really two scenes reflects the limited budget this superhero got as he isn't one of the most popular heroes. I do think the Deadpool stock will rise especially if this movie is a smash at the box office. The final fight scene had some cool action beats but was interrupted often by the silly banter of the protagonist. There was an unfortunate montage of action that would have benefited from another actual scene of Deadpool hunting. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7,1,8,11 February 2016

Annihilation," Heady and gorgeous sci-fi
","The science fiction thriller from Alex Garland and adapted from the novel by Jeff VanderMeer is a gorgeous cinematic experience with an exciting plot. Lena (Natalie Portman) is an army veteran and biologist whose husband Kane (Oscar Isaac) has been missing for a year after he left on a mysterious military mission. When he reappears at their house, he is different. His body starts to break down but on their way to the hospital, the ambulance is stopped by government vehicles and Lena is drugged. She wakes up in a prison cell with the psychologist Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) watching her. Ventress explains the situation to her and why her husband is acting strangely. She also shows her the odd phenomenon that they are calling the Shimmer. With Kane on a ventilator to survive, Ventress allows Lena to stay at Area X, the compound just outside the Shimmer. She meets the crew that is going in next comprised of a geologist Cass Sheppard (Tuva Novotny), a paramedic Anya Thorensen (Gina Rodriguez), and a physicist Josie Radek (Tessa Thompson). Lena begs Ventress to let her come along and the psychologist agrees. The group enters into the Shimmer with the knowledge that no one has come back before. They wake up three days later with no knowledge of what happened after they entered.

Spectre," Low-stakes, low energy 007 outing
","Spectre continues the James Bond mythology and Daniel Craig's run as the globe-trotting, martini swilling, womanizing, super agent based on the character created by Ian Fleming. This film ties together threads from the previous three and this continuity was one of the major selling points to me but did not follow through as I hoped. The new 007 has always been treated as a bit of a reboot, back to the beginning, starting out earning his stripes, series so this takes it to the next level back adding the iconic villain from the past series.This twist should come as no surprise and the big reveal feels a little dead in this internet spoiler day and age. This is one of Christoph Waltz's most unimpressive performances but it would be interesting to see the potential. The continuity also felt like it had to be in there because other stories have done it. There was potential in this installment but several of the action sequences fell flat. Every time the chases came about it didn't really seem to matter and the bad guy lair escape scene was just dull. It felt like an easy mode escape on a video game and ended way too quickly for the potential it could've had. No tension, no stakes, no caring for the characters. It hit all the points so if you had a checklist, fast cars, bond girls, exotic places, evil villain, small pistol, explosions, tough guy henchman, but all of this felt so forced and like no one really wanted to do this but they had all this money so oh well. The chemistry between Craig and Lea Seydoux was nonexistent and Monica Bellucci was barely in the film at all, and seemed sadly unimportant to the overall plot.I hope this isn't the last for Daniel Craig, it would be a bad way to go out. If you're an avid fan, there are some forgivable moments and the nostalgia factor pushes it over the edge. That Sam Mendes directed it shows through in a very cool opening sequence but I doubt he'll continue with the series. I give a 7 out of 10 and it may grow on me when I get to rewatch it.",7,14,28,8 November 2015
Joy," Good performance by JLaw but not much else
","The David O. Russell biopic about Joy Mangano starring Jennifer Lawrence gives the young actor a chance to shine but other than that, it leaves the viewer bored and unsure of what is truth or just embellishment. Russell chose a strange way to tell the story with voice over narration from Joy's grandmother, played by Diane Ladd.Lawrence is at her best when the struggling divorced housewife yelling at her singer husband played by Edgar Ramirez who has another movie released at the same time, Point Break. As an audience member, I rooted for Joy's success, it's hard to root against the American dream.Soon we learn that another source of her struggles is her strange upbringing by her constantly arguing parents played by Robert De Niro and Virginia Madsen. Madsen is the only source of comedy in this movie, which is why I find it weird that this movie got nominated for the Golden Globe under the comedy group. Otherwise, I don't think it gets a nomination. De Niro plays Joy's father whose phone classified dating service sets him up with a wealthy Italian mistress. Isabella Roseellini is the source of some of the best lines of the film and her character Trudy is the source of the primary backing that helped Joy take the business idea to the next level.See more review at swilliky.com",6,0,5,29 December 2015
The Nice Guys," A great comedy noir, funny and entertaining
","The Nice Guys is a great action comedy from the director of Lethal Weapon and Iron Man 3, Shane Black. Starring Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, the movie tells the tale of a hapless drunk private investigator and his odd partnership with a tough guy-for-hire. The PI played by Gosling drinks and slouches his through the story while Crowe as the tough guy punches and fights anyone that gets in their way.I found this movie incredibly enjoyable from the comedy to the mystery to the few action scenes, all of it meshed together nicely. The acting was great for a comedy and the directing kept the pace moving fast. From escaping ruthless killers to confronting young activists to meeting with the head of the Justice apartment played by Kim Basinger and all through parties in the pornography and auto industry, the team up of Crowe and Gosling crack jokes and keep the mood light despite several deaths throughout.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,9,19,20 May 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Inspiring war film
","The intense war drama directed by Mel Gibson tells the true story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), an army medic who saved the lives of over seventy men at Hacksaw Ridge. The movie is carried by strong supporting performances by veteran actors like Hugo Weaving, Vince Vaughn, and Sam Worthington but relies heavily on the young Garfield. He is backed up by Teresa Palmer as his future wife and Luke Bracey whose career is growing as a fellow soldier.The story has a slow start with Desmond as a young boy as he comes to his face after an altercation between him and his brother. Weaving is brutal as a veteran of World War I and drinks through the rest of his life overcome with grief after the loss of his friend. The movie explores Doss's courtship of Dorothy (Palmer) and eventually his enlistment. Once enlisted, Doss encounters a wall of doubt and ridicule from his commanding officers including Sgt. Howell (Vaughn) who is especially rough on him. Vaughn is impressive as the drill sergeant and heads into war alongside his men. Doss does not shed the doubt of his fellow soldiers until the brutal war scene at Hacksaw Ridge. Gibson does not relent on the action pushing the excruciating violence to a horrifying extent that shows the awfulness of war.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,2,5,6 December 2016
Warcraft," Another bad video game and fantasy adaptation
",Fantasy has not had a great history of cinema with the exception of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. Video game adaptations have an even more dubious history. Warcraft melds the two genres into a terrible movie that has very few redeeming qualities. One thing about the movie that I did enjoy were the special effects. The film does a great job making the Orcs look real and humanizing them despite being CGI characters.The genre has not attracted the finest actors but Travis Fimmel is passable as the protagonist just as long as he doesn't have to show any real emotions. There are a few parts where he is supposed to be sad that just come off as ridiculous but he takes his humor and Vikings experience to elevated his game just a little bit. The rest of the cast is awful from Paula Patton as the half-orc/half-human mumbling over her fake teeth or Ben Foster doing a poor impression of Gandalf. It does not bode well for the so far somewhat disappointing Preacher comic TV show adaptation that the two lead actors Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga show up in this movie and phone in performances.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com,3,13,28,13 June 2016
Me Before You," A decent romance if a bit tone deaf
","One of the few romance films I'll make it to this year, Me Before You is based on a novel of the same title by Jojo Moyes. The story tells of a young woman who struggles to find consistent employment to help her family and is employed by a wealthy son of an English family that was paralyzed after being struck by a motorbike in the street. Emilia Clarke continues to attempt to branch out from her starring role in the hit HBO series Game of Thrones and the failure of Terminator Genisys and plays Lou Clark. Sam Claflin play Will Traynor the moody male lead after several roles in movies like the Hunger Games and the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean.Clarke is better as the goofy smiling caretaker than as the Queen of Dragons. She sports her natural brown hair in place of the Targaryen blonde in which she achieved her fame. Claflin is moody and sarcastic as he is upset with his circumstances. The supporting cast included Charles Dance who unfortunately will never encounter Emilia Clarke in the world of Westeros but runs on and off the screen for a few parts here as Will's father. Janet McTeer plays Will's mother who hires Lou to take care of her son. Matthew Lewis appears as Clark's boyfriend, a fitness buff, as he looks for work beyond his days as Harry Potter's Neville Longbottom.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",6,2,12,5 June 2016

13 Hours," A fun, fast-paced Michael Bay military thriller in January!
","Michael Bay's political action movie had some decent acting and a fast-paced plot. It was one of Bay's more thought-provoking and intense action thrillers and a welcome relief from wherever the Transformers series is going. I have enjoyed Michael Bay's films before for their popcorn fun, yet this one take a much more serious tone that handles the subject matter with a modicum of solemnity.There is a budding tradition of war movies at the beginning of the year from Lone Survivor to American Sniper and now 13 Hours. This movie is at the bottom of the three but still intense enough for fans of the genre. I was drawn right in and even though I saw the late night viewing was able to stay engaged throughout, which is really all I can ask for of a January release.The acting was superb for the most part. As I was not an avid viewer of The Office American adaptation, John Krasinski was a new face, especially in an action movie. Krasinski's acting was probably the weakest of the bunch but still not bad. His character Jack Silva takes center stage and introduces us to the city of Benghazi, and the viewer follows him through the attack. I think Krasinski was just adjusting to his new role as action star and has a bright future in the genre if he chooses to continue.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",7,2,8,26 January 2016
Sully," Sully is a great movie about an extraordinary event
","Fall movie season kicks off with the extraordinary recounting of the true event known as the Miracle on the Hudson. Sully recounts the water landing through flashbacks and memories of Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger (Tom Hanks). Clint Eastwood directs this surprisingly entertaining and emotionally movie film that will be tough competition as we transfer into Oscar territory. Hanks is brilliant as the calm, yet self-doubting pilot, and gives Sully a charisma that this American hero deserves, especially in such troubling times.The visuals of the plan soaring over New York City with two engines smoking. Eastwood puts audiences on the plane or as pedestrian onlookers as the plane declines reminding everyone of the tragic events that happened nearly 8 years before. The timing of the release seems planned to pull at the heartstrings of American audiences and help us realize the disaster that was avoided because of the quick thinking of the captain and the emergency crews in New York.I was unsure of how this movie would fill two hours and though it is a little shorter than usual awards bait, every scene is important and at no point was I bored and found myself blinking away tears or on the edge of my seat for plenty of scenes throughout. The hearings pit computers versus man and Sullenberger is unyielding in his certainty that he made the right decision, at least in public though he shows doubts in his conversations with his wife, Lorraine Sullenberger (Laura Linney).Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",8,1,3,10 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," An interesting further installment of the Alien franchise
","The latest installment in the Alien franchise ties Prometheus to the creation of the xenomorph. The crew of the Covenant spaceship has been sent into space to colonize a planet but when a solar flare burns their captain, the new captain Oram (Billy Crudup) decides to follow a rogue transmission to a closer habitable planet. Daniels (Katherine Waterson) has reservations about this unvetted planet but goes along with the crew when they head down to the surface as well as the android Walter (Michael Fassbender). Remaining above with the main ship is Tennessee (Danny McBride) and a couple. The crew explores the new planet finding the familiar alien ship but an airborne virus floats into two crewmembers who then shake and burst out xenomorphs. After a gory scene and the ship blowing up, the crew is under attack by the monsters when David (also Michael Fassbender) leads them away to a corpse-filled mausoleum. As the crew waits out a storm, they are slowly picked off by the creature. Lope (Demian Bichir) manages to establish contact, and Daniels instruct Tennessee to bring down a cargo loader that they can use to escape the hostile planet. David reveals to Oram that he has been experimenting with the genetics of the virus and shows off the eggs. A face-hugger bursts out and snags Oram impregnating him with a xenomorph.",7,27,45,21 May 2017
The Martian," A Great Space Survival Story
","Based on Andy Weir's fast-paced novel this movie delivers as an adaptation. The great director Ridley Scott takes on this epic tale of the harrowing plight of Mark Watney (Matt Damon) and the Nasa team and space crew of Hermes that saves him. The humor was well delivered and keeps the plot lighthearted despite the difficult circumstances a lone man finds himself in on the harsh environment of Mars. The cinematic work was gorgeous, the large empty expanse of the red planet played well on the 3D big screen. Mackenzie Davis look beautiful and Donald Glover was hilarious in their small supporting parts, but the main performances that carried this film were Chiwetel Ejiofor and Matt Damon. With a great supporting cast, amazing special effects, and a fun, educating, and interesting plot, there isn't much not to like about this new great space survival story.",8,3,22,5 October 2015
