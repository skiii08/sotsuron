The Avengers," Brilliant film
","I love the way Marvel have brought Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk and Thor together. The plot is brilliant and I especially like the 'Battle of New York' scene where Hawkeye, Black Widow, Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk and Thor fight against Loki and Thanos' armies in the middle of New York outside Stark Tower as it is full of action. I also like the way although it is an action film there are aspects of a comedy film in it as I found some parts of the film funny. It is one of the best films that I have ever seen and I really enjoyed watching it! Overall it is an exceptionally brilliant film that I would strongly recommend!",9,1,3,11 April 2014
