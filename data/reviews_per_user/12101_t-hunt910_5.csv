The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Twilight franchise still not working after the forth attempt.
","Having been dragged to cinema by other half to see all the other films in the Twilight series, I still have major problems. Breaking dawn part 1 still is full of embarrassing dialogue which at times is unintentionally laughable. The wedding sequence in this film is particular guilty in this respect. The much hyped sex scene with Edward breaking the bed in the throes of passion with Bella made the majority of the audience laugh. The director Bill Condon appears to have being studying carry on films to much. The werwolf's in the film do not fare much better. The sequence where they communicate with each other with out moving their lips is just annoying. The only part of the movie that works is when Bella finally turns into a vampire which is mainly due to excellent use of CGI. The only other effective sequence is Bellas wedding nightmare. Additionally the film is seriously compromised by its 12a certificate. The birth and sex scene etc. should have much stronger and more explicit for the film to have real dramatic impact. In terms of reviewing the film,in reality there are two types of movie goers in the world, those who love twilight and those who don't. The twilight believers will never accept any forms of criticism about their beloved franchise . In view of this the movie should be avoided at all costs except for twilight die hards. For husbands and other half's dragged to the flicks, it least the film is just about tolerable.",3,7,11,22 November 2011
Train to Busan," Well worth seeking out this South Korean Zombie epic.
","Train to Busan makes most zombie film look pedestrian in comparison. While you average zombie film moves along like a car stuck on the M25, this movie moves along like a Porsche on high-speed racetrack.
The director throws every thing at the movie including the kitchen sink. Like all great movies you really care about the characters, which makes the hyperactive, never let up ending almost unbearable to watch.
Its 2 half hour running time allows the script to include every plot device seen in most recent zombie movies. But most importantly it never drags. Its claustrophobic setting allows the director to pull off some unique moments of crisis. Also GCI and stunt team do a very good job here.
Highly recommended not just by me but by the director of Sean of the dead no less, how can you go wrong.",8,2,3,14 January 2019
Ex Machina," Alex Garland AI movie holds you interest to the stunning end.
","Recommended for the serious film buff, however if your science fiction movie is more action based like transformers, this film is not for you. Your interest level will soon evaporate. If you are prepared to however to give this film the time, Garland take on the nightmare consequence of android self-awareness has much to admire. Intelligent dialogue combined with a compelling storyline set in a classic confined location delivers the goods. The android in question Ava is brilliant combination of Cgi and excellent acting from Alicia Vikander. This can be seen most tellingly in the scenes where she seduces and manipulates Domhnall Gleeson the computer programmer who thinks he is carrying out the Turing test on her. The dynamic scenery used in film adds to the impact of the film. Excellent direction by Garland and the rat in the cage in ending also adds to the package.",7,12,24,1 February 2015
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Twilight final fanfare offers a little for the non be-leavers
","For the long suffering other halves dragged to the cinema there is some good news. Firstly and most importantly, this is the shortest twilight movie, with a total running time of only 155 minutes. One should be able to stay awake with out much difficulty. However films final climatict punch up between Dolce & Gabbana inspired vamps, CGI shaggy dogs and team Bella in fact is quite enjoyable. Much credit for this must be given to Michael Sheen performance as Aro. Michael is clearly having a ball here playing Adam on Ant on acid. This dramatic sequence is well staged on the whole with a excellent use of CGI minus the shaggy dogs, which have never worked for me. Also to be fare to the film makers, Bella hypersensitivity to stimulus when she is reborn as vampire is also very effectively shown. Unfortunately the film is plagued by the faults evident in the twilight franchise. Firstly, main central leads performances are not the best. Kristen Stewart tries here best but at times is let down Robert Pattinson wooden performance as Edward . Taylor Lautner acting as Jacob is overshadowed by his torso. Secondly producers determination to get 12 rating for series does not help either. A more adult approach would would have produce a more sensual and darker movie. Additionally Bill Condon laid lack approach to direction leads to many unintentional Carry on moments. In summary tried to like movie but alas still having problems. Twilighters however will love it.",4,8,20,20 November 2012
Super 8," Excellent popcorn film , however not one for serious film buffs .
","A film with many echoes from the past. Some movie goers may accuses J. J. Abrams of shameful plundering Spielberg's back catalogue, but for myself and other movie goers who watched the film this was not a problem. In fact they reminded us how many big budget fantasy films of recent times are devoid of geniue moments of wonder and surprise.Even though Super 8 has many derivative elements, my review is based on the entertainment value of the film. If you want to analyse the picture, you may find it lacking. The story to be trueful has some lapses of continuity , some of the characters have no real depth and the slight nature of the story is sure to irritate.However if you want to to be entertained the film does the job. The story moves along it the right pace, not wasting time with irrelevant sub plots. The many unknown Juvenile leads are excellent cast. Additionally the CGI used in the movie is used to tell the story, but is not part of the story. The only time this is overused is the protracted and over the top train crash sequence. In summary go to see Super Eight if wish to be entertained and remember most movies are truly not original. If you looking for serious fantasy or have post Spielberg hang ups the film is best avoided.If you do decide to see Super Eight wait for the end credits, its worth it",8,0,0,13 August 2011
