Scarface," SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!
","Scarface is a 1983 crime film directed by Brian De Palma, and a remake of the 1932 film.Plot: Scarface tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who arrives in 1980s Miami with nothing and rises to become a powerful drug lord.Positives: As a fan of gangster crime films, I love how this film told the story of one character's origin to become a drug lord. The dialouges was excellent, as well as the script and writing. Al Pacino was amazing, and this is one of his best performances ever. I also love the violence and soundtrack in this film.Overall, this is one of the best gangster crime films ever made, right next to The Godfather films, Goodfellas, and The Irishman. I'll probably review more gangster films too. I'm going to give Scarface a 9.75/10.",9,1,1,21 January 2020
