The Ring," Go see this one for a good Halloween scare!
","What a great flick! This one is a real winner. I'll admit I was reluctant to see this one, but I am so glad we went! It was very unique in it's plot and was not afraid to steer away from the ever so common thread that holds most thrillers together.
