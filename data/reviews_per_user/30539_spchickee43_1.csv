The Legend of Bagger Vance," Not what I expected
","Originally, my only intention of seeing this movie was because the gorgeous Matt Damon stars. Little did  know I would be addicted to watching it till the very end. I'm not a golf fan myself, but seeing as the events of the movie led up to a golf match, I was glued to the screen, waiting to see what would happen. While Will Smith came in toward the middle of the movie, he delivered a serious yet unintentionally funny performance that lit up the screen. Matt Damon, aside from his looks, was well picked for the part of Runnulph Junuh (a strange name- which makes it hard for the viewer to imagine the actor as the charactor and not himself). He played the disillusioned war veteran quite well, although some parts of his performance were weak. Charlize Theron played well, although this wasn't her best performance- her part wasn't too big. But who really surprised me was the narrator, a young boy named Harty who looked up to Junuh. His presence really gave the film a nice touch, and it gave Junuh a little something more to strive for (being a good example.) Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie, and I'm waiting till it airs on HBO again to watch it!",Null,1,3,9 August 2002
