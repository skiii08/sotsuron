Skyfall," Worst Bond Movie so far........
","I can not really express my disappointment with this latest Bond movie. I really like Daniel Craig as he is good actor and i mean it, but the plot is so badly written and scenes are so unrealistic that you could forgive it 25 years ago, but not in 21st century. Start of the movie is exciting, really cool, but how on earth you can get info from HDD that has nothing on it(only OS)Files are stored on servers not HDD (especially for organizations like MI6, i mean come on?)were you have to log in with key fob or secure password that you change every week or month and you only have read permissions and you can not store data on HDD. So the plot of the movie was lost here. More or less then we come to the final scenes were it all blows to smithereens with 2 gas canisters. Would be fine to blow a room - yes, not much more, mansion - not so much and take down the chopper(stupid idea and how much outdated???) REALITY CHECK FOR WRITERS. Then Bond was a about kilometer away but Silva catches him on foot and some other guy appears from nowhere and then the freezing water, how bad else it could go wrong. I could do much better script and write any day and for the movie with such a humongous budget somebody had to get a better writers. Disappointment for me as i really love Bond movies and it looks like it is going backwards and does not follow modern day life.",3,7,28,3 February 2013
Frozen," Wasn't bad, but animation has to be better...
","As many of viewers of this animation I enjoyed watching it. Probably from here most of the Disney's animators and their project leaders should take few pointers. As a blockbuster (especially from Disney)the animation should be expected much better than 2 sister characters, well made and drawn,and their dresses. Most of the other world around them looked very plain, snow is going to put some plainness, but when characters move through it, the trail is very unimpressive. Anyways, there are much more detailed characters that are drawn in the gaming world and one games many characters are much more detailed with the budget smaller than this movie. Animators: look at final fantasy 13 and you will appreciate character details, also areas around them. It begs the question if Disney is settling for middle standards or lack of talent in their animator divisions. There is of course differences between game and full flagged movie, but once the character is created the rest is making them move on set backgrounds. One more thing, I got the impression that character eyes are a little cross eyed. Good effort, but this kind of scale movie has to do better on animation and story has to be more interesting, especially for fairy tales of this scale.",6,2,5,27 February 2014
