Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ep. II doesn't make this film any better
","Yes, I'll say first off I'm one of those people who was geeked for this film went it came out, and walked out of the theatre hating it.  I still hate it, it is just a bad film.  If it wasn't Star Wars, would I hate it as much? Honestly, probably not, but I don't think I'd like it either.This film fails on every level for me.  It reads like a collection of loose scenes that Lucas imagined, then conjured up a lame story to tie together. For NE1 out there who thinks he had the whole story planned out back in the day, you really need to learn to research things.  This movie illustrates at every level how not only did he not ever plan the story, but he didn't even have any ideas on what to say in the 1st 3 movies.Now that I've seen Ep. II, I can say for sure, that Lucas is a technician, who can achieve amazing things with special effects, but he is not a director or a writer.  He must have had a *lot* of help back on the originals to come up with such better films back then.  Of course, it helped that he didn't direct most of them.  Lucas still manages wooden performances with great actors.So what's bad about Ep. I?  The midicholorians, the plot (lack thereof), the horrible racial stereotypes (which if it's not intentional, is just plain embarrassing), the main villain's lack of screen time or even development, Jar jar (a crime against every person who ever liked Star Wars).Really it comes down to this... I was 4 when the original came out and Luke Skywalker did not have to be 4years old for me to relate to him.  By making Anakin a child, Lucas made a gigantic mistake.  The biggest weakness of this film can really be summed up like this:This film is childish whereas the original was childlike.That's at least how I see it.  If it weren't for the Star Wars name, this film would've sunk like the stone it is.",1,1,3,26 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Eye candy
","I'll say up front that I hated Episode I.  And after that fiasco, have come to the conclusion that I really don't care for what Lucas has done with the Special Editions either.  That being said, I think Episode II couldn't help but be better than Ep. I.  And it is.  But once again, this movie suffers from Lucas' weaknesses as a director and a writer.  The plot is still overly convoluted, filled with horrible dialogue and contrived situations.  The characters are wooden and for the most part unlikeable.  I thought all of actors did a decent job with bad parts and bad directing, but none of it made me care.The action and effects were pretty good, but you expect that in something from Lucas.  I for one am tired of movies where that's the only thing going. Lucas is a technician and should be playing only the technical role.  He needs a real writer to hone his ideas, and a real director to add depth and resonance to the performances and situations.  I for one would rather see Spider-man again; that movie, despite some lower quality effects, had character and made comic situations seem real.  Better drama too.I'm sure the fanatics will disagree with me, but the fact is that the new Star Wars movies can't hold a candle to the originals, and all the digital technology in the world won't make Lucas into a good director.  I'll probably see Ep. III when it comes out, just to see 'how it ends,' but these new movies definitely fall into the 'rental' category.  If it weren't for the Star Wars name, I think most people wouldn't waste time in the theatre on them.  I certainly wouldn't.",1,0,1,26 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," captures spirit
","Peter Jackson has achieved a masterpiece... I think it's a crime this movie was only recognized on the technical front at the Academy awards.  This movie's got everything... action, drama, comedy.  The effects are amazing, and unlike some other recent big movies, the acting is stellar as well. The casting is outright amazing, don't think I'll ever be able to picture anyone else in any of these roles.  The movie, while not a literal interpretation, captures the spirit of the Tolkien books absolutely.Can't wait for the DVD...",10,1,1,26 May 2002
Spider-Man," Best comic movie ever
","This movie ROCKED.  I loved it, it was better than Cats, I want to see it again and again and again...Seriously though, Tobey McGuire is Peter Parker/Spider-man.  His performance was fantastic.  And Willem Dafoe, rocked as the Green Goblin.  The story was excellent.  Sam Raimi was the perfect director for this film.  Can't wait to see what happens in the sequel.  Some of the effects were a little cheesy (CGI-looking), but that doesn't hamper the story.  I give this flick a 10 all the way.  This sets the bar for all movies to come based on comics; this is the way it should be done.",10,0,0,26 May 2002
