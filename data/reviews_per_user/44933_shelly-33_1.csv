The Blair Witch Project," I actually paid attention, so i liked it. (i might give a little away here, but not much)
","I loved this movie.  Every bad review that you read on this page is probably from someone who did not pay attention.  These negative 'know nothing about films' disgruntled movie-goers keep saying things like, 'Well, i didn't understand the end'.  WELL... if they had paid attention from the beginning, then they would totally understand the end.  (As with most movies).  I mean, if you start telling me a story, and i ignore the beginning, but then listen to the end and am confused, would it be fair for me to complain to you that i do not understand?  No, it would be my fault for not paying attention, as it is THESE PEOPLE'S faults for being so inattentive to the plot. I have also heard complaints of a 'shaky camera' problem.  Well, DUH. They're cold, they're scared... and, gee, I guess they left the Steady Cam at home, eh?  If all of the footage was perfect and straight, then i wouldn't believe the movie.  Oh, and another complaint that is unfounded is that it's 'three whiny crying annoying kids... fighting about where to go... totally don't know what they're doing...'  No freakin crap!!  They're college students, not Paul Bunyun.  Excuse them if they don't really know how to survive in the woods!  By the way... if you were wandering for days and couldn't make it back to your car, and every night you're terrified, i think you would be a little on the edge as well.  people fight in scary situations, it's human nature. Oh, and one more thing... STOP COMPLAINING THAT THE ENDING IS CONFUSING! OF COURSE IT IS CONFUSING!!  I can't believe that these people are actually, basically complaining that no one was filming after everyone's dead.  i mean, was the WITCH supposed to pick up the camera and finish the movie?? The promo says, 'three kids dissappeared, here is the footage that we found.'  when the die, the film stock dies too; obviously. 
BOTTOM LINE, ALL YOU 'NEGATIVERS', AS SOON AS -YOU- MAKE A MOVIE AND EDIT IT AND PUT IT IN THE THEATRE, THEN AND ONLY THEN WILL I TAKE YOUR CRITIQUE SERIOUSLY.  you have no right to judge until you've done it yourself.",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
