Alien 3," Atmospheric
","This much maligned film is far better than most people think.  David Fincher adds a wonderful well suited visual style.  The production design is unbelievable, the script is very serious and incredibly well-acted by Weaver, Dutton, and Dance. Understandably not liked by people expecting another action film like Aliens, if this movie was not related to the Alien series and didn't have the former films to live up to it would be regarded as a film classic.  There is truly nothing bad in this movie, everything works well together and comes to an emotional climax.  If you see this movie see it in widescreen, it is far better that way as is for all movies.Note: There is actually about 20 minutes of extra footage which was cut from the film which Fox will hopefully add on DVD or tape.  It would add alot more tension and action to the film.",Null,1,2,27 September 1998
