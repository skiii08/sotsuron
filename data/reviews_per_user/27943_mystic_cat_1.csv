Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Movie To Make Benefit Of All Viewers
","Seriously, this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. There were only a few moments during the movie when I was not laughing out loud. Borat's inexperience makes everything he does that much more funny. The best part about this film is the outsiders view of America. Borat dives headfirst into our country and throws caution to the wind. He learns about humor, etiquette, rodeos, driving, baywatch, toilets, and religion. One of my favorite sub-genres of comedy movies is the mockumentary, and this movie gives Christopher Guest and his crew a run for their money.His exploits will keep you laughing long after the movie ends. If you are looking for a laugh- out-loud comedy, you will not be disappointed.",10,4,17,4 November 2006
