The Avengers," Thest best action superhero movie ever made
","The special effects were amazing. I loved the way they worked humor into the movie. To have so many powerful richly developed characters come together into a single movie with a story line that gives each a fair chance to shine is an amazing achievement. Given that these characters first formed in my imagination as a kid when I was buying the comic books, and developed over the years in various movies, seeing this all come together in such a great presentation was entertainment at its best. Should you take your kids? There was no Transformer g-string / bathroom stall moments thank God! There was a lot of violence, but it was presented in a Star Wars like fashion that did the best job possible at reducing the goriness factor. Our kids absolutely loved this movie. Thank you for all who worked so hard to make such a great entertaining move!",10,1,5,14 October 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Do not let your kids see this movie
","It is very sad that the director chose yet again to weave into a kids movie totally inappropriate and unnecessary sexually explicit content. Besides that, the movie was awesome. The offensive nature of the one scene in particular was so bad that our kids will never see another Transformer movie and I will be very leery about any movie by this director or affiliated with Hasbro. I can't believe that a toy company with such a strong brand would allow their name to be tarnished with such trashy scenes when the primary audience is likely to be kids. I gave the movie a 5 to average out the 1 for inappropriate content and the 10 for great story, special effects and imaginative robotics.",5,2,9,14 October 2012
