Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Apparently the American people really are as stupid as those in the movie.
","This movie is awful mostly because the (alleged) humor is so base, only a 10-year-old would find it new or interesting in any way. This guy really hates women. I don't mean the character, I mean the writer. I honestly felt sick to think that my daughter is in the world with people like most of those in this film. It scared me. If you don't think Woody Allen is intelligent, you might actually like this movie. I think he's trying to make other people in the movie look stupid, but obviously only uses the stupid ones in the film. The absolutely only appealing thing about the film is Borat's swimsuit, which is kinda sexy. Otherwise beware, you are entering a slop house that will stink until you leave...",3,3,7,16 May 2007
