Iron Man 3," So Bad, I want a reboot already
","The Movie is just not good. I was not happy with it. It got too much money. All the awards it got nominated for and Money it got was just not cool. Fans Hated it. I did too. I was just plain upset about what happen to the Maderin. Marvel ruin a character who could have been just as popular as The Joker or Loki. Look at the trailers. It looks like its going to have a Dark tone. When you see the movie, it has Waaaaaaay to much comedy. I could not understand it well because so many people were just laughing and I could not hear. Plus people were laughing at stuff that were not even funny. These girls behind me were just plain annoying laughing win nothing funny just been said. Also I was not happy with War Machine not keeping his old suit. Its overrated and ignore the credits. 3/10",5,3,6,28 January 2014
Man of Steel," The most UNDERRATED superhero movie of all time
",Their mite be a few minor spoilers I originally did not like Superman. When is saw the teaser of this movie I decided to read a few of his comics and look at some DC animated movies. I thought he was so cool that he became my sound favorite DC hero (after Batman of course).This is a good Movie. I can tell you right now fans who hate it love that Iron Man 3 movie which is the most terrible movie of the year. It is not bad at all. Anyway the only thing I against in this movie is all the action. Overall it is awesome. Henry Cavil is the best superman ever. Amy Adams was good too. I am glad the movie did not have any humor like Iron man. Im fine with just a little but superhero movies with humor usually go to far and it is basically a comedy film.The movie is awesome and be on the look out for its sequel. The rumored title is Batman vs Superman.,9,3,8,5 February 2014
The Matrix," Awesome.
","The Movie is the best Action and Science Fiction movie I ever seen. I loved it so much along with the sequels. I Even brought the Four collection case of the movies. I will watch them every once in a while. I like the main character (Neo), who I use to wish when I was young could meet his actor Keanu Reeves. I thought Morpheus was good but I thought he looked like a guy you can not trust which is why I understand Neo did not. Trinity was good. I like her in this film better than the sequels. She was a hot-head in 2 and 3. Agent Smith was kind of cool but I was annoyed that Him in the rest of the Agents were almost unbedable. It was great and fun to watch and it is definitely a good prequel to watch first before you see a sequel.",10,0,0,7 November 2013
