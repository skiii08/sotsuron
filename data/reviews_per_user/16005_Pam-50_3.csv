The Blair Witch Project," The only true horror movie to come out in years
","I have always been a huge horror fan. When I was a kid, I would get nightmares after watching scary movies. I thought that the reason I didn't get nightmares anymore was because I had outgrown it. But it turns out, I just hadn't seen a good horror movie in awhile!My main complaint with horror movies is that they always show you too much. Gore isn't scary, it's just gore. What's scary to me is playing off of what many people are scared of already: the dark, the unknown, unidentifiable sounds, being lost and alone.Blair Witch captures all of these phenomenally. It's as if their sole purpose in making this film is to remind the horror industry what they're supposed to be doing. I hope they listen, because this movie scared me half to death. And, finally, I had a nightmare!",10,1,2,1 August 1999
American Pie," Funniest movie I've seen since Swingers.
","I'm usually not the type of person to laugh out loud at home, let alone in the theater. But I was howling all the way through American Pie. People in the theater were screaming and laughing. We had a fabulous time.",10,1,2,1 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A very mature approach to sexual relationships.
","The day before we saw Eyes Wide Shut, my sister-in-law, who is 19 and not dating anyone, told me how disappointed with it she was. After seeing it for myself, I wasn't surprised. People who are in long-standing sexual relationships are going to be the ones who appreciate Kubrick's mature, honest approach to the possible dark side of every relationship. Relationships can sometimes seem like a tightrope walk between loving someone and hurting them. It doesn't take much to move from one to the other.One of the details that I appreciated about Eyes Wide Shut is the way in which it allowed the main characters to be wealthy and still arguably normal. Wealthy people in films are too often portrayed as either spoiled and bratty or psycho and drunks. The activities that Tom Cruise's character ends up involved in are pretty out there, but the way in which he became involved and his and Nicole Kidman's reactions all seem normal and healthy.",9,1,2,1 August 1999
