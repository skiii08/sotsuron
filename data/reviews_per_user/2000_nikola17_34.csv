Blade Runner 2049," Been Waiting for This Sequel For Very Longtime But Now It's Finally Born
","Just About Time for Sequel for Blade Runner 2049 and thank god it Didn't bomb or it flopped or anything like that it has been great to Have sequel back that everyone has been waiting for all these years I Have forgot about Blade Runner because it has been awhile since I have Seen it but then when this come out I still have the DVD I Bought It since 2008 I got into it but then I said where the F is Sequel??? Now it's Born and yes it's about time someone did a sequel of Blade Runner Denis Villeneuve I am fan of Sicario. Ridely Scott should been doing sequel Since years ago then we could have still have a lot Blade Runner Movies He could have any chance to make sequel rather doing Prometheus. But anyway Sometimes it takes years and years for sequel to be made if someone rushed It then it won't be good sometimes it will flop bad but I hope their Always be a Third Sequel but please not in next 20 years later or more Years later just to make 3rd or 5th film of Blade Runner. Cast Thank God they got a really good lead actor Ryan Gosling I Always love Ryan Gosling is Blade Runner I thought Role Suited for him To be in franchise I hope he gets in big franchise not someone else Replace him I wanted to see Ryan Gosling in all movie franchise with Harrison Ford good well cast in film Jared Leto thought noting special He hasn't done much in movie I am not a Jared Leto fan at all I thought He did OK not best or great actor of all time. I thought the colors of Movie looked well like a Neo-Noir like Only God Forgives and Atomic Blonde interesting looks of movie me I Really Wish they gave Dave Bautista more to do or given his character a lot More I thought they Gave Dave Bautista lead villain role I won't mind That if that happens like Rutger Hauer role that's what I thought or Maybe rather than having Jared Leto. Dave has more of looks of being Villain has more of look of evil looking person more then Jared Leto, for this movie I would Love to see that but it's Shame. It Continues from sequel from (1982) Blade Runner it actually does it's Amazing how they bought back staff from first movie there is a lot of Things they explained about First Movie you have 5 minute scene of (Dave Bautista) Sapper Morton I Thought the scene together is really good but I wish it was better Giving Bautista something to do a lot more give him a bigger role for Villain. The city has a lot new looking big city I love the new look of Scene with hologram of Naked Girl kind of idea of Total Recall chick with 3 tits but it expect its different looking of it I thought the city And looked dam fantastic, You have other characters Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright) she is boss of K giving him orders something to do found long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) that everyone knows, who's been missing for Thirty years. I am not going to spoil it but there is a lot things in This movie talks about 30 years ago showing it they is a lot of it like This movie is very connected to classic movie from (1982) Blade Runner. Now if you guys like Slow Burning film it maybe put you sleep a little Because I did its bit slow but you get the hang of it don't worry it's Not really of boring movie like Star Trek. It's really good film it's Not that really of boring movie it's not a Action SC-FI or SC-FI Horror Film. Joi (Ana de Armas) she is not really in the movie she is only in It she is Hologram when K Gets back home. Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) he is theirs not much To say it's hard to explain what character he plays as role. That Is Hard To Explain It's noting Special he does play Bad Guy in this movie villain but he is not much I Don't know why is he in movie for? my opinion just have Dave Baustia as lead Villain he looks and sounds evil. Harrison Ford Role in movie doesn't Appear until 30 or little longer minutes of movie but then he is back In all movie still but remember the role starts of Ryan Gosling K the Acting between them is really good just don't watch full trailer of it because it Spoils everything 2h 44min is running time of movie it's great to have A sequel back a lot of hard work for Denis Villeneuve and rest of Actors it's very long movie but hey it's worth it but try not full a Sleep while you're on theater watching first watch Blade Runner (1982) Classic then this it's thriller SC-FI not Action everyone like in Trailer don't watch trailers of this movie or anything that's how every Movie or sequels flop because trailers spoil everything believe me go And see movie or see little teaser that's it 10.10 great sequel have a Look please specially for Blade Runner Fans don't listen to Disappointing Debut of haters or read about website don't even read About if go and see it problem solved",10,2,8,10 October 2017
The Equalizer," Man on Fire is a Similar To Equalizer
","the first look of the poster it looked like sin city with the darkness Denzel Washington holding the gun it looked like Sin City Poster to me other hand is that Antoine Fuqua is my favorite movie director i really loved his movies all of them Shooter (2007),Tears of Sun (2003),King Arthur (2004) Olympus has fallen (2013) witch is my favorite movie of time. Training Day (2001) First time working with him Denzel Washington SECOND time with worth another movie with A Denzel in Equalizer witch was a great movie to see the director working with him again in Another Best Picture Movie like Training Day in a Violet Thriller Film people think it is a Action movie like Man on Fire (2004)Thriller movie people say this it is so slow and boring well duh ? it is a Thriller movie but it is similar movie to Man On Fire NOT REALLY (Denzel Washington)including i love the doling saying Got to be who you are in this world, no matter what. that part was very good. in movie Robert McCall was a Retried Black Ops Government Home Mart Hardware Store later on meet girl (Chloë Grace Moretz)at a local diner in Boston, Massachusetts where he frequents. He comes to find out she is an escort who has ended-up in a life she really doesn't want to be in. He tries to convince 'Teri' that there is a better life for her while making it his duty to ensure the people responsible for abusing her and other women pay the ultimate price. Teri as a Prostitute a very young one got beaten up buy her PIMP Russian mafia he has to help Teri Girl. then goes out to find out who did it a very good scene in 10 seconds he fights with gang in Room you have glory fight scene witch was good,Villain eh was noting special (Marton Csokas)Triple X (2002) playing villain again when he finds out 'Robert McCall' is interfering with his operations and sends an enforcer, 'Teddy' played Marton Csokas to Boston to eliminate 'McCall. you have great showdown at end of movie like Robert Taking guys out that ''last showdown'' part was EPIC and this theme song on movie soundtrack The Equalizer Official Soundtrack And Song Vengeance By Zack Hemsey song matched just perfectly, it added that last touch....truly including Eminem Song Sia Guts Over Fear was just awesome for this movie amazing﻿ glory film. This movie is based off the television series called 'The Equalizer' i never even head of it before even i never cared for it but now i care about movie sometimes when they make great movies you think it is a first made movie but then later on you find out it is based on TV Series. but movie for me Equalizer(2014)still good, story was awesome touched my heart for a bit and it looks like a bit like a TV Show but it is a Movie not a show. Starting Denzel Washington was still better for me i am big fan of Denzel Washington 2 Guns (2013), Man of Fire (2004), Training Day (2001) was very awesome movies with him since this is what i am fan of Denzel and Director as well was fantastic this director suits, Washington suits, story suits very well done made picture of movie was just perfect Denzel had a different Character that makes you care for him and follow Character.this is kinda Revenge movie witch was Similar to Man on Fire was great movie it was a Revenge film but in a very different way 7/10 i really liked Denzel Washington movies and Director Antoine Fuqua was the best working together in the best time haven't worked for 14 years since Training Day one of the best movies ever i loved Denzel Washington in a lot of movies keep this up.",7,5,13,1 October 2014

",great to be back a action stars one movie again with different storyline and different director and different actors makes new movie Jean Claude Van Damme and Scott Adkins and Chuck Norris was amazing thing what they did to big him back in set is Chuck Norris should not retire he should go on in Making More Movies and Why i Love this more then first one well first of the start was amazing when Expendables riding cars and killing all man and I Love scene when Stallone was riding plane and the rest of Expendables was riding speed boats in lake killing all bad guys that was Amazing scene of movie and they show the actors more then the first one and apart of Jet lee didn't do much in this movie then you Have Female Star that is one Disappoint girl i didn't like i think she was terrible actor (Nan Yu) she replace Jet and she is on all movie then Jet. and Bruce Willis wants the paycheck of guys but one of men been killed and i think new actor Liam Hemsworth was Terrible i don't know why they get him in ? but it was lucky that he is not in Movie of Expendables 2 and the thing is the movie shows all actors like Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham and Dolph Lundgren and Terry Crews and Randy Couture and Nan Yu the Terrible women that what they show in all movie not Jet and they do show more Arnold Schwarzenegger in start and he is in only 4 Scenes he does something on this movie more Job more then Expendables 1 but he kills people and saying funny staff and Jean Claude Van Damme Better Villain because the Villain from first movie was a bit lame but this one was better and Van Damme is many but not many scenes of movie i like when he kicked the S*** of Liam Hemsworth and scene when Stallone takes Revenge and fights with Van Damme was great better showdown then the first one and Scott Adkins was Van Damme right hand man bodyguard like Steve Austin who Protect Van Damme and Scott Adkins is actor like Van Damme but not really the next biggest Scott is in some Van Damme movies like Assassination Games AKA Weapon and Shepherd The Border Patrol and Expendables 2 and Universal Soldier Day of Reckoning and Scott doesn't play as main character all time he didn't act like his own character he wasn't acting and not looking different in movie he act's and looks like another character of Yuri Boyka from Undisputed 2 and 3 and i love the fight scene with Jason Statham vs Scott Adkins you get to see big fight form that and Chuck Norris was not many parts not working for Expendables Booker was funny and awesome character he does a lot of action in this movie but not a lot as Another but Stallone calls him Lone Wolf like in that Chuck Norris movie Lone Wolf Mcquade (1983). just wish that Jet and Chuck was fighting in this movie like Expendables 1 with Dolph but in EX2 didn't happen and Chuck is saying he's own joke about some cobra that scene was funny and he kills bad guys with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis he is many parts not many he doesn't do much still but he did better job then EX1 and i just enjoy this movie it's fun and better action scenes then the EX1 and showing the actors a lot more then the first one EX2 was better but i got Disappoint with Liam Hemsworth and Nan Yu why ? no cares about them no one talk's about them these 2 actors no one gives a crap their characters were dumb but i think they should got young girl for Expendables 2 should be Gina Carino or Michelle Rodriguez or Lucy Li better then Nan Yu i think she was lame Nan Yu is from another Dolph Lundgren movie with her in Diamond Dogs in low budget movie and i better action scenes the start was better when Expendables was Cars and fighting in war zone and bloody gore scenes words on Cars say's Bad Attitude and coming soon love that when they put that on on there Cars and they saved Arnold and then went to plane and start Shooting the Another guys from another boats and shoot out scenes at diner with tank was better and then after Chuck Norris come and when Expendables toke Revenge and all Expendables shooting at Jean Claude Van Damme in truck then crashed into airport was amazing then Arnold Schwarzenegger say's i will be back then Bruce Willis you back enough i will be back and Arnold Yippee Ki Yay that was funny scene just movie was fun and fast placed very good film then the first one 10/10 again,10,1,3,19 August 2013

Everything has a price, b** in Matrix (1999) and David Leitch is a Stunt Man done a lot of Stunt work movies ,Actor, Assistant Director and Stahelski and Leitch's approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation including Martial Arts Movies ! fight choreographers and gun Martial Arts,Techniques Combat Staff from Hong Kong action cinema was additionally influential in the development of the piece As well as prominently paying homage to works such as John Woo's The Killer Awesome Directors they know what's Action really is then other directors around from today. i wanna see them doing more movies like this they great directors with great ideas they know whats real action movie really is expect they are better directors then terrible John Moore and Michael Bay does in his movies expect he kinda screwed up Transformers and EVEN worse then that he messed with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie this why these directors are better, it's there first movie they directed everyone loved it, bought great Keanu Reeves Back i wanted to thank you so much do more Action movies they should be directing more movies like this Action Stars in movies it doesn't have to be the 80's every Directors Does Traditional 60's 70's 80's 90's classic they wanna make just like Traditional things doesn't have to be young, Middle,Old it matters what suits actor, and strong fit Keanu Reeves is 50 years old it doesn't matter if he is OLD he is GREAT STILL FIT AND STRONG every movie doesn't have to be young people it matters what suits the there role and movie John Wick was A Great movie. 11.10 i really enjoyed this movie very well R Rated Perfect Actors Great Action scenes no shake camera, the movie had a heart to it the Action Perfect, Guns,Girls,Cars,Combat,Hit-man everything in movie 10.10 one of great Revenge movie like Bullet to the Head (2013)!

Lone Survivor," Great Story,Great Movie ( a Little Spoilers)
","well i finale saw this movie based on true story based on acts of courage in opening scene there is Real Footage of Soldiers doing real risk Training footage at the beginning of the movie is archive footage that was commissioned by the Navy. Director Peter Berg needed a way to sum up the training and selection process chronicled in Luttrell's book, which spans approximately. yes that was true director is starting to be good almost great if he does great film like this one he is good director from Welcome to the jungle AKA Rundown, Kingdom was good Battleship was good i guess i know everyone hated it but i like it i thought it was good like Transformers but Battleship was a silly but very silly idea should have done better idea for Battleship i enjoy it but it's my opinion. (Mark Wahlberg) was great just like his all his movies, (Ben Foster) worked again with Mark at Contraband witch is good film ended up in this film (Taylor Kitsch)was good actor not great actor from Savages,Battleship,John Carter i saw these movies when he is the main role but not this movie he's not main role in this movie i saw his last movie Savages witch is great. that's i know but i know (Eric Bana) is not part of this movie but still good but he played as Lieutenant Commander, this movie was based on True Story it was real little staff a bit made up i don't want make Major Spoilers movie had great Action Scenes the war scenes were great no shaking camera's Scary when there is only 4 Soldiers 200 Taliban Fighters attacking them Lone Survivor that follows the real life events that happened in 2005 to Navy SEAL Mark Luttrell and his team in the Afghanistan Mountains when a secret operation is compromised. shot of movie looked awesome it's over impact great looking shot on movie this like Modern Warfare a bit in this movie it doesn't have any punching holes in movie great when this happened in 2005 witch i didn't know this happened 8 or 9 years later movie was made witch was shocking for people for there family they were brave soldiers very brave Marcus Luttrell is brave soldier he was just Survivor that because Mohammad Gulab saved him i think he trusted him the funny thing on this movie is when Mark Walhberg ask for knife the boy gets duck the father comes get's knife from kid he thought that he was going to kill it but he didn't do it funny scene but that didn't happen in movie that was not true that was made up i give this movie 10/10 Mark Walhberg does True story movies like Pain Gain he should a bit more true story movies this movie should own Oscar my favorite movie in 2014 in beginning",10,1,6,24 February 2014
Fury," David Ayer DOES IT AGAIN
","David Ayer is one of my favorite directors after everyone hated Sabotage i like Sabotage including this one as well, this is like End Of Watch but with soldiers,tanks,Nazi's,bloody, Tiger 131 tank lot's of tanks call of duty war style not with street gangs and cops end of watch no more this is war movie with great idea with great cast, with great characters expect little bit better characters then sabotage characters some were likable some of them were just idiots (Brad Pitt)likable US Army S/Sgt. Don 'Wardaddy' Collier was awesome best performance just like Inglourious Basterds (2009)Playing Character like this felt like watching Inglourious Basterds 2 Lt. Aldo Raine Brad Pitt character but his character was funny but not in this movie who previously starred in 2009's WWII-set Inglourious Basterds, entered final talks to take the lead role of Wardaddy.(Shia LaBeouf) Transformers T/5 Boyd 'Bible' Swan i don't mind Shia but i think he didn't do noting for me i thought he was OK but everyone is annoyed with actor i don't mind him but i expect Tom Hanks like saving Private Ryan.(Logan Lerman) Pvt. Norman 'Machine' Ellison was in war in 8 weeks new soldier i thought he was good character he was afraid of war because it his first time he needed to be trained a lot brad character telling him be brave, (Michael Peña) Cpl. Trini 'Gordo' Garcia was funny awesome his character was VERY Same as End Of Watch (2012)playing same character him as cop now as brave soldier in tank including he is Spanish character again dialog was funny not going to spoil it (Jon Bernthal) The Walking Dead,The Pacific Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis was idiot as character but he was funny not my favorite character in movie there's noting much saying about it i love these ideas with characters names like in call of duty names nicknames is awesome like sabotage. Fury had a lot great action scenes a lot tank battles, a lot big guns shooting with blood and guts, cool scene when 100 Nazi vs 6 American soldiers in tank staying it fighting against them was so wicked watch a lot blowing up destroying war movie never seen before to me i love tank battles to me it was best one i ever saw in this movie Fury pits a tank filled with five American soldiers at the tail end of World War II as they struggle to fight off a small army of Nazi soldiers that are closing in on them. David Ayer directs this brutal and grim war film with no romance to it. Ayer's film is grim, bloody and unrelenting and fully captures the absolutely horrific nature of war. this is like so in the vein of Saving Private Ryan and Lone Survivor, Band of Brothers, Pacific David Ayer got great produces Bill Block John Lesher, Alex Ott, Ethan Smith were great not skip woods lucky he didn't bring skip woods in if he did it would ruin movie so badly. Fury had a lot of violence to it a lot of gore a great war movie this is not the first time that David Ayer directing war movie he, he was a writer in U-571 was awesome to see him back again to direct war movie just like U-571 this movie was so good great 8.10",8,2,5,31 October 2014
Point Break," i would break this Pointless Remake of All of time go watch Bus 657, Triple 9, Town, Heat Robert de niro & AL Pacino, American Heist
","*** review contains spoilers*** GOD i knew how bad this movie was going to be,come out after new years finished i didn't bother watching it at theater i was waiting for Hateful eight on that time. i rented it for $1 cheap Rental Shop and saw better movies in theater then this trash, movie didn't need to be remake it should leave original Point Break (1991)Alone Original was great film, great cast, well shot Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze complete great cast. this remake is little bit different to original but movie is ended up samething as original film still bank robbery but with bikes and stunt jumping, cast is so bad Luke Bracey ?? is such bad actor has no talent i don't know why this guy gets chosen for and He is not great actor like Keanu Reeves, Expect Keanu has Talent great performance from Keanu was right guy to be Point Break that's how everyone loved original film so much. if i was directing Remake i would have gotten Chris Evans to be Johnny Utah. Gerard Butler was going to be Bodhi dropped out because he think crappy paycheck Rubbish Cast flat story again wrong actor to be Bodhi Luke Bracey most terrible actor to work with of crouse Gerard Butler was doing London has fallen witch is better movie i saw then this.%100 of movie is same plot,(Luke Bracey)Extreme sport athlete riding motorbikes with his friend jumping in desert Mountain Where 127 Hours was filmed that what it looks like Johnny jumps over lone stone column his friend didn't make it got killed off seven years later he is FBI Johnny has to go undercover Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez) Gang Surfers as in bank robbery's (Ray Winstone) Angelo Pappas is his partner met girl Samsara Dietz (Teresa Palmer)they fell in love almost samething as original but there is samething but little bit different in plot Johnny Utah in Original 1991 was a football player became a FBI With stupid remake he is Extreme sport biker, seven years later he become FBI agent has to undercover Bodhi same plot but little bit of difference different extreme dangerous sports sky diving and snow boarding rock climbing that's difference but people can go watch Cliffhanger rather then wasting time with this movie it's not really worth it the chase scene is not form bank this time it's now motorbike chase Johnny and Bodhi both crashed weather was raining. Bodhi was saying we knew your cop he thought he can product him and he let johnny in gang, Johnny is shooting in air when it's not even sunny like in 1991 Point break does samething like keanu reeves does witch scene looks TERRIBLE THAT INCLUDES ACTING gosh original movie chase with Johnny and Bodhi was even better there was reason why he shot in air. but in this pointless movie it's just for money looks different same scene when johnny was shooting in air like a little girl can't shot Bodhi like 5 miters when he is not even far like in original film.there was no bank robbery scene like in original movie they never showed it at all it's just shoot out scene when Bodhi and his gang got out goes for 30 seconds Johnny chase's bank robber he thought it was Bodhi but it was Samsara see in original they didn't turn her into villain so there was difference but ended up to be same movie but with little bit different writing of film, different set of ending where johnny and bodhi final scene but Johnny jumped of helicopter landed on bodhi boat in heavy wave, Bodhi said i am going to go he surf's up same movie, same writing, just different set ending, there is no bank robbery scene, when Johnny kills his girlfriend see there was difference if you see original movie but again it's same movie with little changes to it IS STILL TERRIBLE MOVIE the action scenes OK but not even that extreme not even that fun very terrible CGI bad 1.10 Pointless movie don't ever check it out unless check out Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze Point Break (1991) was even more extreme more likable characters they showed bank robbery scene is better specially point break is little bit like fast and furious (2001) Vin Diesel and Paul Walker has to undercover street racers level of stunt choreography xXx and Fast and Furious wish they had.but with this Pointless how in earth they got green light to do this most unforgettable Remake ever made.",1,2,3,27 March 2016
Creed," Mickey Build Rocky Legacy now it's time for Rocky Build Creed Legacy
","i got excited when i head about this making movie spin off Rocky Movie based of Creed i love rocky been huge fan of Rocky of all time i love it all time best motivation franchise in history. Creed keeps up story it's spin off but based on another character it's different movie but with story it continues like Rocky 7 but it's not Rocky 7 it's not rocky movie but i was thinking of Rocky Balboa (2007) ended well there's no need for sequel of movie ? i love how movie brings back a lot of memory's in past bringing characters back where are they now in rocky movies on another characters. Michael B. Jordan was great choice of playing creed. it's good they bought back Sylvester Stallone back but in story i never expected to have rocky to have cancer and i expect rocky to be back in ring fighting with someone but i never to expect. Sylvester Stallone was part of movie witch is great to have him in it Plot: since 1998 Adonis 'Donnie' Johnson Creed (Michael B Jordan) in prison getting into fights then 10 years later he has gone into heavyweight boxer Champion fighting in Mexico in that scene he won good fight scenes in film. soon he goes to another GYM someone told him he's dad died in ring Apollo Creed in Rocky IV but there was no flashback when Apollo get's killed but there moments about that talked in film. Johnson is bring idiot never think about his dad died on ring when he doesn't have to be like his dad he want's to be like his Dad. but he wants to be Boxer goes all the way Los Angeles track Rocky Balboa find him in restaurant what Rocky Earns talk's about match's and story's in rocky 1 and rest of them about Apollo Creed death. Donnie wants Rocky to train him but Rocky has gone old. he said nah i been threw all that he doesn't want him to get killed but rocky gave him a chance to train him. so rocky made a deal to Donnie to train. to have fight against 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew) it's his first movie. creed girlfriend Bianca (Tessa Thompson)was a singer falling in love with Donnie getting long together. half way i didn't like when Rocky is having cancer that's such bad idea it wasn't Stallone idea. Stallone didn't want another rocky movie at all it's the director wanted another one for money. there were moments about rocky son Robert Balboa, moved with his girlfriend in another state never wanted to talk with Rocky i love how story goes it tells events from another rocky movies after Rocky Balboa (2007) followed up Rocky starting to be like Mickey trainer but i crossed my fingers that Rocky Balboa doesn't die in movie in but he doesn't witch is good just let everyone know and training scenes were same as previous rocky movies they were thoughts about the Apollo Creed because it's spin off Creed had good performance in movie since Rocky franchise Sylvester Stallone was a superstar still A good comeback but not best Stallone didn't needed another Rocky Movie but it's good to have 1 Spin Off i was stressed after i saw trailer i thought movie might turned out to be bad. soon everything turned out well, best Rocky franchise 4th rocky noting can beat that movie i love that movie more then any another rocky movies in franchise and this spin off ! 8.10 it's a good movie, the following after rocky balboa (2007), good flashbacks but movie didn't needed to be made no more rocky sequels or creed sequels !",8,4,8,27 November 2015
Deadpool 2," It's Really Good Sequel to watch Believe me It's Worth It for your time
","Ok Most People liked this movie and loved this movie to death well me to i love DEADPOOL as well i have mask of it, game of it, first Deadpool movie i love it, sequel is great nothing wrong with sequel, Expect Its' Better Sequel then to Kingsman 2 Golden Circle aka I Would Piss on movie would be piss gold. I Saw This Movie 2 Nights Ago I Still Remember this movie it was great a lot fun, a lot laugh's a lot of it their is little up and downs but it goes back up but not saying this movie is not worth watching well it is. i would even say it's little bit better then first movie because in first movie in opening of action scene, action stars then shows back story, then action well doesn't do that in this movie, this is a lot of fun full on the action full on GORE, full on laughs in movie full of it. I Thought new characters like Cable / Nathan Summers from Future (Josh Brolin) A time-traveling cybernetic soldier He Did GREAT Job in this movie i thought he was great character great looks of character, he nailed his role i rather say his role is better then Thorns In Avengers Infinity War David Leitch i loved his idea of sort of classic buddy-cop fare', and compared them to the characters portrayed by Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy, respectively, in 48 Hrs. (1982). i thought story and direction is great same director who did Atomic Blonde, he was also Uncredited director of first John Wick (2014), so was one of stunt man in a lot of action movies so he knows Action well then to any another directors like Tim Miller but Tim kinda slow down the action in first movie. but this a lot full on this is a lot fun keeps you watching you have another weird looking cameos like Brad Pitt Vanisher he is invisible man you won't able to see him, Matt Damon as Redneck #2 (as Dickie Greenleaf) , Terry Crews from Expendables 1-3, White Chicks, Gamer, Everyone Hates Chris as Bedlam was funny and great to have him in movie but the thing is most stupidest thing is to waste him off ? i wanted him to be in all movie it would be more funny to have him he suits for action and comedy, Bill Skarsgård as Zeitgeist not much to say I guess he had time to do IT playing clown and Mutant in sametime in different role, that was weird and random like out of nowhere just wasted them for nothing of their talented just used them for nothing. new characters Domino (Zazie Beetz) know for the Netflix anthology series Easy she is A mercenary with the mutant ability to manipulate luck i thought she was ok character did good, Russell Collins / Firefist (Julian Dennison) did alright was bit annoying time and time but wasn't annoying to any another kid roles in another movies like X-MEN movies, As well as portraying Deadpool and himself in the film, Reynolds also provides the voice for Juggernaut. The character is credited as being voiced by 'himself'. Juggernaut was previously portrayed by Vinnie Jones in X-Men: The Last Stand. they could still hire Vinnie Jones to be Juggernaut back why not ? this is related to another X-MEN movies why don't they just hire back Vinnie Jones BACK in BIG SCREEN see him again as Juggernaut back to this ? i mean why they use Ryan to provide the voice for it when Vinnie Jones is still around making B-Movies when they could just hire him back as same character ? when their is nobody else it just doesn't make sense and it's stupid they get back Vinnie Jones from X-MEN Last Stand to be Juggernaut ? it sounds oblivious stupid. i thought Villain AGAIN sucked Headmaster (Eddie Marsan) who worked with David Leitch In Atomic Blonde, He is in Ray Donovan, Miami Vice (2006), he turns children into Mutants Russell Wants Revenge, i am ok that was not interesting, the thing story a little bit of it was confusing as well you want to know it but it doesn't explain it but it doesn't ruin movie badly, their are a lot funny moments in this movie a lot of it makes you laugh even more and more
it's very entering, the action was a lot of fun, Josh Brolin kicking ass playing more bad ass then to Thorns in Avengers. action opening and soundtrack fits in perfectly i loved opening scene slaright away of Action and gore and laugh's slaright away that was great ! but it doesn't slow down like in first movie action story then back to scene witch i thought that was annoying but it doesn't do that in this movie.and yes i didn't forget beautiful Brazilian chick from TV series of V for Vanessa
(Morena Baccarin) was not much in movie she was more in first movie but thank god movie at end it saved it not ruined as bad as what it is, when you watch movie you will understand what i mean, it's bit weird but hey it's movie you will get to point towards end of it. movie had a lot crossovers a lot it from X-MEN movies it's great sequel but not my favorite movie of franchise Just yet i am waiting for rest of another DEADPOOL movies Sequels DON'T EVER LEAVE THEATER OR TURN OFF MOVIE AT IN A MID-CREDITS SEQUENCE ,ENDING SCENE IT WILL EXPLAIN END OF MOVIE EVEN MORE PLEASE DON'T MISS THAT OUT IT WILL EXPLAIN MORE AND MORE. for me this movie 9.10 it's worth of your time, it's worth for money, it's worth to see this sequel if you loved first movie to death or fan of X-MEN movies, i enjoyed it i am into dark RATED Comic Book movies for this was right one for me to see.... everyone go and see it.",9,3,6,21 May 2018

Southpaw," My Favorite Movie in (2015) it's A KNOCKOUT
","this movie punch's me in heart like Rocky, Raging Bull i love boxing movies with Motivation even i am boxer for 3 years i love movies like this i knew i am going to like this movie i knew i was going to love it specially this movie is much better then Equalizer(2014)i didn't hate it but i didn't think it was the best movie that Antoine Fuqua made but i think this movie is best just like Olympus Has Fallen (2013) and Tears Of Sun (2003) has made a lot good movies Southpaw is brilliant when i say it's knockout it's a knockout because first of all everyone thinks it is like boxing movie and yeah but it's not what you think when you see movie it's like rocky it's about him in boxing but it had something else in movie to it like southpaw i never want to spoil it for everyone because it is exciting movie when you see it like rocky never spoils it that's how these movies got so great ! i am not putting this movie over top of Rocky franchise i am huge rocky fan ROCKY IV (1985)is Brilliant moviethis is had a lot of good actors but Antoine had to change idea from Denzel Washington to Forest Whitaker to change a little bit of it of cast to get someone else different someone told me it should have been Forest Whitaker it should be Denzel Washington i am like they 2 good actors in movie but there is gotta be one but it has to change i mean Antoine is getting denzel in Training Day and Equalizer but he never got to chance to work with Forest Whitaker witch he had great performance in movies witch i really like idea to have Jake Gyllenhaal is the best choice i don't have good ideas to pick boxer expect i would pick ufc fighter or boxer for this movie but i want good actor for this movie Antoine Fuqua picked a great actor for this movie i liked from My favorite movie end of watch (2012) jar head (2005) witch i really like i wasn't fan of night crawler (2014) but i thought this movie is like i am going to put this movie over the top of Night crawler SOUTHPAW is one of my top movie with Jake Gyllenhaal then Nightcrwaler. 50 cent is not part of movie i thought he is one of my favorite rappers for music specially for him to be in movie he has OK acting but not good as forest and denzel or any another actors he is still good in movie he wasn't part of it. specially for (victor Ortiz)Ramone wasn't in it for very longtime only 3 scenes only for 5 minutes well yeah punching and training at Jake Gyllenhaal and including Roy Jones jr is in it plays himself witch is great to have boxers and ufc fighters in movie for bit but i expect for awhile like in all movie.plot (Jake Gyllenhaal) Billy Hope is a light heavyweight fighter lives in New York City with his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) and their daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). Billy won the fight and won a lot of money and then Maureen had good choice that she said that you should stop fighting because he has daughter and that's how fighters should do to stop for awhile to spend time with there daughters a lot more time. then he had speech and told he's fans that what he is doing so then the villain this time (Miguel Gomez) Miguel 'Magic' Escobar wanted to fight with but then he got into fight with Miguel someone shot Billy wife Maureen after 8 weeks Billy lost Fight Punched The Referee specially he lost a lot of money and can't pay rent to his house, Billy and Leila are broke lost his daughter because he was arrested with abusing alcohol and drugs including gun possession won't see his daughter later on billy finds he's own way out to get back into fight and ring get's into business with (Forest Whitaker)Titus 'Tick' Wills but he expect him to help him to get back of his career and his daughter.(Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson)Jordan Mains was helper use to be but then when billy went poor then Jordan left him without helping him but Jordan can't do anything for Billy so Jordan left him beyond and billy has only got Titus only to help him bu Jordan was helping Miguel because he is in the Business still and paying him to fight. this movie had a heart to it when Leila as daughter because Billy Wife doesn't want Leila to see him fighting because that's what mother wants not let her see him fight but she has to because he's wife is dead no one of his family is with him. that has a heart to it and also the fights was so good and it was great soundtrack with Eminem and Tech 9ne was PUMPING ME UP i love the soundtrack and movie so much to death so much specially ending was just fantastic and ended so good this movie had me in tears such a great movie 10.10 best movie just like rocky these days with boxing movies are so good warrior was eh i know the boxing is unrealistic in movie i don't know how to explain it. but this southpaw had a heart to it this movie is much better then WARRIOR (2011) this is one of my top movies in 2015 one of my favorites kicks more ass then Equalizer (2014) witch movie i didn't hate as bad but i thought this movie had got better everyone should check this movie out it's really good go and see it",10,1,4,13 September 2015
Justice League," I Have Waiting For This To Be Made In 12 Years
","*** review contains spoilers***When I Was Kid Back In Primary School Like Grade 4 I Always Curious To Know When This Movie To Be Made. I Am Like 2005 Come On They Have CGI They Can Cast People Simple, In 2005 DC Could Have Made Justice League Before (2011) Green Lantern, I Am No Green Lantern Fan But I Am Just Saying If DC Made Justice League Back In 2000s Like 2005 With First Role of Green Lantern It Would Be Different. But Green Lantern I Am Not Fan of It. Now In End of Year December Justice League was really good movie i really enjoy it a lot people say it's Average Yeah In My Opinion I Really Liked I Understand It's Bit Confusing Movie I Don't Want to Write It But if you Have Seen Batman VS Superman (2016) then this but After Batman VS Superman Was Suicide Squad. but then to this movie Story Follows After Events Everything Was Gone Back To Normal After Superman Dies I Am Like Superman CAN'T DIE everyone knows that lol ops spoilers but just let everyone know Superman Can't Die Unless Green Crystal. So Villain Steppenwolf Wanted Cube In Amazon Is Stolen And Atlantis Is Been Stolen. From Steppenwolf And Wonder Woman / Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) was telling Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) Everyone Knows Batman, Wonder Woman is telling Bruce how Bad Steppenwolf Stole Cube, Steppenwolf Could do with these 2 cubes is to destroy world. Now On Diana Wanted Make Team Bruce Meets Arthur Curry / Aquaman (Jason Momoa) To Be In Team, Then Bruce Meets Barry Allen / Flash (Ezra Miller) his father is in jail he wanted Barry to get future then visiting his father in jail, he Visited his father everyday in Prison. Bruce Wanted Him To Be In Team It's Like DC Version of Marvel Avengers, And Diana Meets Victor Stone / Cyborg (Ray Fisher)he was great character in movie i like to see movie with him of his own his character is bit of mystery to it Diana Wanted him to be in team and when he thought about his home is been Home Invasion he decide to join in Team and Yes Superman comes back in movie, but it's confusing a bit In Batman and Superman at end when superman dies then in coffin everything is moving i really, really thought superman would just break out of coffin out of his grave fly out of his own ? but then in this movie how Justice League got superman back to life is samething what Lex Lather did to General Zod well Justice League got superman out of his grave then put him in water samething then comeback to life when everyone thought he would break out of his grave because his superman that makes a lot of sense but if Justice League didn't do that then Superman would have been dead forever. it makes sense even i thought the story is bit mixed up and confusing with that part of movie i never liked when that happened i expected that to happen but i don't know if that is writers or Zack Snyder written it because i thought he rushed his Batman VS Superman and this very fast if he toke time to release this movie then he would have changed a lot things to it. theirs a lot of CGI In EVERY Superhero movie now i am starting to sick of it. i am more into Traditional Action movies i am not really of a Superhero fan at all but this movie was really good i enjoyed wasn't slow it wasn't movie of 2 hour long like your going to sleep for longtime like Batman and Superman and Wonder Woman or Man of Steel this is actually fast pacing movie i like it that way in Middle of movie they plan to face to enemy to save world of Invasion like in Avengers A LOT LOT of CGI Hollywood these days are gone weird and loving to hop on CGI Machine all day with movie all day with it now on theirs so many movies of CGI are in it too many of it. and action is fun not many body counts in it and funny thing in this movie they haven't mention about Suicide Squad yet ?Because Batman vs Superman is After Suicide Squad then this movie this had Credits at end of movie when movie ends don't ever leave theirs 2 more credit scenes in movie don't ever theirs very excited ending to movie don't leave until it ends 9.10 It's Really good movie it's fun it's not very long 2 hours long like your going to full sleep that's why i could say i like this a lot more then Batman VS Superman or Wonder Woman or Man of Steel that is too long but this movie no it's very long time it only goes for 2h not 1 hour or 2 hour something like it's fast pacing of movie it's really good give it a look it's not average to me but give it a look it's better then Batman VS Superman.",9,0,1,3 December 2017
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," this movie was Awesome (2013)
","this movie when i first head about i got into it i saw this movie last year this one of movies i liked in (2013) great movie i ever saw i am fan of this movie i think it's underrated i never read the books before but hey if you going to yell at me because i never read the book give me the book then. what i liked about this movie is the idea having brother and sister becoming witch hunters they didn't choose it, become witch hunters because when they were kids they almost got killed by a witch but they killed the first witch when they were kids growing up to become hunters when they haven't expected to become like one Hansel is good character Badass entering his pretty good i don't have problems with Jeremy Renner he is awesome i liked some of his movies he was in Bourne Legacy,Avengers,Town,SWAT,Hurt Locker, Mission Impossible 4 but i am not biggest fan of him Gemma Arterton she is not that famous know as from Quantum of Solace,Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,Runner Runner that's what she's know for i think she was a Sexy Badass Character that's it i can say i like 3D very good shots in these years from now there is a lot of movies are in 3D a lot of movies all the time. Villain Famke Janssen was OK she was Villain in X-Men The Last Stand, Golden eye but she wasn't amazing person or character or amazing she was OK doesn't do much she was a witch i like the monster Edward he want's to join Hansel and Gretel because the witch's was bad to him so he want's to join in group the Action Scenes were cool i like the traps, fighting i like the part when the white witch kills all the another witch's, Hansel is saving Gretel the Showdown with witch at end was good but could done better i like ending when they go to Desert killing the witch's shooting the cool gun that's end i hope next sequel turns out well 10/10 Excellent movie i saw in 2013.",10,0,3,2 January 2014

It Follows," New Age 80's Teen Horror,John Carpenter Style
","****review may contain spoilers****these days horror movies are not that good anymore witch it sucks a lot more like saw and hostel horror flicks too many camera footage flicks like unfriended,Paranormal Activity are not that great as this movie teen horror movie or show teen wolf i don't care for. this is like teen horror real horror movie like Nightmare of elm street,fright night,Friday 13th,lost boys, John Carpenter style to movie and these days with horror movies are not so great these days like Just look at last year with horrible releases such as Devil Inside,Ouija,Tusk,Devils Due,The Gallows this is for horror fans only with great taste this is one of my favorite horror movies i can watch over and over again. with no cheap stupid jump scenes this movie is one hell to watch. even i liked actress (Maika Monroe)the guest(2014)Dan Stevens movie glad to see her as main role in another movie like guest but it's not horror flick this is a horror flick she has a great taste of 80's traditional new age 80's idea and soundtrack score was so awesome worth of listening in movie is so well made. Rest of the soundtrack that sent chills me to listen to john carpenter soundtrack Even when there was nothing happening the 80's synth music kept up that level of intensity.Plot (Maika Monroe) Jay Height was young girl been followed by unknown supernatural people may know or she not know of people who was following her, her collage friend Jeff Redmond / Hugh (Jake Weary)went out for date with Jay while they were on there car having sex Jeff gets chloroform her to make her go sleep. jay wakes up on place where she is tried up in wheelchair. i love how every movie is like the cinematography of the movie. From the very first scene with a fixed rotating camera, you know you are in for a very distinctive cinematic look. That distinct look is also there with the setting of the movie. You don't really know in which era this movie takes place. Jeff explains to her what's going to follow her the unknown supernatural if it follows you it would kill her, but then Jay and her friends (Lili Sepe) Kelly Height sister of jay and (Keir Gilchrist)Paul was close friend (Olivia Luccardi)Yara (Daniel Zovatto) Greg Hannigan they are group of friends are going to Product her and help her to stop unknown supernatural.specially how fun and original smart way of making movie of great ideas for movie to be 80's style new looking film, A Modern Horror Classic film refreshing psychological horror film with a simple premise and a chilling concept and John Carpenter horror movie style and shinning. Directors in every movie is carrying and using John Carpenter style of movie music,movie, how its made like 70's 80's movies with making new age of music score is perfect made Its outstanding cinematography and soundtrack make up for this. director David Robert Mitchell had noting to direct his movies only his was little big hit only made 2 million budget film witch isn't to bad it's his first idea for movie Weird and intense this movie is like guest but guest is not horror movie but it used new age 80's style with same actress (Maika Monroe)doing this type of movie again i wanna see more of her movies like this action,horror,thriller. This is gonna be one of those classic horror themes people remember in the future. The soundtrack from The Guest and It Follows are my favorite type of movies with this movie is that Movie had an excellent concept It'd be cool if we could know a bit more about it the thing that follows, like some back story of some sort The movie needed that. 8.10 is my rating for this movie i hope it gets sequel",8,39,78,8 June 2015

Chris is going away for a week withhis girlfriend Rose Armitage family house (Allison Williams)they go to her family house neurosurgeon Dean (Bradley Whitford) and psychiatrist/hypnotherapist Missy, and her brother Jeremy(Caleb Landry Jones). At the house, everyone tries to make Chris feel welcome, he had good time with family they were kind all that but there is something he doesn't know about family that well, anyway there is scene looks so stupid scene with Chris and Missy on scene when she holds a cup try's hypnotizes him with tea if she stirring it will knock him out what a stupid thing i have ever saw i understand film but the this writing of it i think its dumb it knocks him out if she is stirring the tea what the heck ? the stupid scene from movie its SO dumb how Chris was going to smoke outside then sees Walter (Marcus Henderson) scene when he runstowards him then turns right while hes running i am like is that meant to scare me because it wasn't scary away from noting and house butter is Georgina (Betty Gabriel) i rather watch The Purge: Election Year with her in it i like her character a lot more then this film who doesn't look any scary when she laughs she cry i am like OK i don't understand that's scary none of another characters are good expect for lead role chirs is alright and next day when the party everyone that family knows they had there's guy i swear he dress and really looks like a discount Version of Pharrell Williams he really looks like him the character Andre Hayworth AKA Andrew Logan King (Lakeith Stanfield) the hat he wears i thought that was Pharrell Williams not be racist have a look so any way everyone who was their are kidnapped brain washed them boo ho the film is slow boring, there is noting too it specially there is a stupid scene when Chris Takes a picture of Andrew the flash hits them they have suffered an epileptic seizure, first of all they get a nosebleed i am like really who would take a picture of something during the day when there is sunlight its during the day outside Chris somehow forgot to turn of flashlight from his Phone i was going too say who would take a picture during day sunset its bright day someone takes a picture with flashlight just to take a picture ofAndrew in movie scene i am like why don't you check if the flash light is on then you take a picture, but i know the movie is trying to be thrilling that's SCENE when guy says GET OUT i am like roll credits form this silly dumb film ending is noting the ending is SO dumb compete this film should have not went in my way i will kick out this film because its gargbe i don't know why this film is shown in theaters whats the fun experience about this film, whats scary about this film you have a silly dumb lame twist towards at end i am not going to spoil the movie for everyone or else its not fair because they haven't seen it but its just big huge time waster i have wasted $24 dollars forticket i wanted back SO badly this movie is not worth for your time GET OUT of it. its not really that good the story and writing is not that great its silly when it gets towards it, its not even scary some of scenes are just funny but they meant to scare you off the edge of your seat but it doesn't it just wastes your time thinking if you like movie over rating believe me its not that good 1.10 director is worst Jordan Peele actor and director he did Keanu worst film of all time now this hits to theaters when you see this movie half way in 30 get out of this movie get another movie to watch i always wanted to leave theater i wish people got out of theater watched something else but i payed 24 bucks walk out waste of money and time.....",1,15,37,19 May 2017
Drive," Good Film Better then Only God Forgives
","well this movie i saw this movie 2 years ago i was into it was fun movie and entering very enjoyable movie i ever enjoy i know it's slow place but not very long movie like only god forgives. characters were enjoyable of Crouse they were some of them not likable but didn't care for the car stunts were pretty cool no shaky cameras i didn't see any camera shaking most of movies when there's sometimes of camera shaking not in this movie. acting of Ryan Gosling was pretty good character i am not fan of him i think he was good in Drive,The Place Beyond Pines,Gangster Squad,Notebook Only god forgives was not that good i thought he's character wasn't good in new film in 2013 Only God Forgives. in this movie it is not Action more of Crime Drama film nice songs in movie Nightcall,Real Hero song in movie was good and camera shots was good and i love part when he gets away and part when he knock the guy at Elevator out gore noting like that scene from only god forgives and noting special its not that long movie it's fast, Byran Cranston from Breaking Bad joined this he was pretty amazing i loved his character he reminds me of character of grand theft auto games, specially this has great performance with Byran Cranston but the best Byran Cranston Performance was for me Breaking Bad i didn't like him in Remake of Total Recall (2012) i thought it was crap.

Guardians of the Galaxy," My Another Top Superhero Movie Since Blade (1998) Non-stop Adventure
","i am not much of superhero fan i like Marvel movies, DC Comics Movies i loved this movie so much with great characters perfect Main Character was (Chris Pratt)Peter Quill / Star-Lord was awesome ! playing character like Han Solo flying ship but without Chewbacca, who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. when he find Assassin his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana) was awesome as Character i always loved Zoe Saldana because she was always great best actor from Avatar (2010), Losers (2010) Colombia (2012) was awesome next kick ass action girl star plays as An orphan from an alien world who was trained by Thanos to be his personal assassin and seeks redemption from her past crimes She betrayed Ronan. she is not Villain but she is on Team on Guardians of Galaxy to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, In Prison along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper)was awesome to have he was funny in scenes he was so good with the dialog in movie (Rocket) has a lot of laughs, with the best dialogues sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a tree like humanoid saying i am GROOT i thought he was going to say something different but Vin Diesel one of My Favorite Actors has a very easy script just saying i am Groot because he is not human he is a Humanoid Tree he don't know talking good like people talk so his Vocabulistics is limited to 'I' and 'am' and 'Groot,' exclusively in that order.Diesel was playing with another actor from Riddick (2013)(Dave Batista) Drax the Destroyer Before Dave become actor he was a Wrestler, MMA Fighter appeared in several direct-to-video films since 2009 to Big Budget movies like Man With Iron Fists, Riddick 3rd Movie, Guardians of Galaxy he was a A warrior in search of vengeance against Ronan after his family was killed. he was fighting again with Vin Diesel like in Riddick was good but it didn't go long good to see these 2 actors playing in movie again he is my favorite character in movie he was best the best Action Fight scenes were awesome with him kicking ass expect he did a lot more then Riddick (2013)because he wanted to do more in this movie apart form Riddick it wasn't bad idea because he wasn't part of it i love Drax Dialong has a lot of laughs, witty dialogue, characters The characters are really well presented were interesting and easy to like All of them have great moments and keep us wanting for more and more. you feel sorry for characters a lot movie is a bit sad including that what makes characters good and interesting their emotional core is stronger and back stories The film doesn't take itself very seriously, which was refreshing to see after also great yet darker Picture of film themes of Thor and Captain America. the characters were based on Avengers and Thor: Dark world the The Collector was in movie so this movie is based to another Marvel movies i hopefully to see Guardians of Galaxy Meet Avengers that would be a BIG Movie entertaining, non-stop adventure but which i was thank full for this movie when i am big fan of Vin Diesel,Dave Batista, Zoe Saldana is still Beautiful as character playing as Avatar to Alien in Guardians of Galaxy my top movie in (2014) with great Dialogue, lots of humor, soundtrack was nice, story exciting.",10,1,4,12 August 2014
Logan," Wolverine movie to date for the last time Hugh Jackman on Big Screen
","Plot: In the year 2029, mutants are on the brink of extinction, with no new mutants having been born in 25 years. Logan was the only original X-Men only left and Charles Xavier AKA Professor X. (Hugh Jackman) James 'Logan' Howlett, formerly known as Wolverine,from Hugh Jackman in this movie was just spot on and really captured the ways Wolverine felt at certain moments. It added layers to this film. When Wolverine gets into a fight, Hugh Jackman is so good in these scenes it's like he got into a fight with Cartels. Logan spends his days working as a chauffeur Limo driver and hustling for prescription drugs in Texas. His body has aged greatly because We've never seen Wolverine this vulnerable. He's old, he's broken down, he's beaten. He can't heal like he used to. Logan lives with mutant tracker Caliban (Stephen Merchant) in an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Mexico, where they care for Professor Charles Xavier, who is suffering from a neurodegenerative disease which causes him to lose control of his telepathic abilities to devastating effect witch he could notcontrol he is mind he loses it anytime. One day, Logan is approached by Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, who wants him to escort her and an 11-year-old girl named Laura to a place in North Dakota called 'Eden'. you have villain Donald Pierce(Boyd Holbrook) as Donald Pierce, Transigen's cybernetically-enhanced chief of security, tracks down Logan and requests that he help him find Laura that's what he request Logan for but he didn't expect it, but Logan refuses like he thinks she is totally crazy and mixed up with someone. she requested Logan for a job with good money he Expected it to do with her with some business and next day everything gone strange Xavier knows that little girl aka Laura / X-23 A strange mysterious young mutant, who is 'very much' like Logan that's what Xavier said she looks like a lot like you. all Donald and his men come to Logan place his men i know the actor from Bloodsport II & Bloodsport III, Matrix Reloaded, John Wick (Daniel Bernhardt)Bone Breaker is only in it for 30 seconds shame for me because i wanted to see him fight with Logan he has a lot great Martial Arts fights i wanted to see that in this movie fighting Hugh Jackman but it didn't shameful happen. Donald men come over because they wanted the girl back but Logan is unsure to give her away but she ended using claws like Logan but it's expect its 2 claws in each hand killing a lot guys and Logan is kicking ass the all film is long but then it catch's up to action pace because it's last Hugh Jackman Wolverine it's full on him discovering what is going on about girl and everything i don't like too spoil never wanted to spoil film but it's a lot fun gore bloody X-MEN Wolverine film it's the best idea for his last movie because if it was PG in my opinion and everyone else is it would be bit less inserted to film but R RATED works for me that's why i loved movie and matter fact The movie is just over 2 hours. The first 45 minutes and the last 45 minutes are the best part of this film. I have never seen a superhero movie like this. It's brutal to its core. a lot hardcore action Logan is a film which I consider it a privilege to have seen. When you see the film, you'll understand. This is a FILM, not a super hero movie. like X-MEN Prequels these ones are for kids this movie is not made for kids it's true that's why it is hardcore R RATED film ending of final showdown keeps you watching and watching like you don't want get your ass out of seat because it is in very edge of it. never take your eyes of it. it's expect for X-Men fans witch i am not X-MEN fan anymore witch i got tried of it when i heard about this film this what i expected it to have a style of Brutally violent, emotional, and character-driven, 'Logan' is the Wolverine film that i was waiting for This is definitely not an action film. There are action sequences in the film, but they are not the main focus of the movie like the previous 2 Wolverine movies tried to make them be. 'Logan' is a grounded film, a film that really takes its time to tell its story and to develop its characters. It's a character-driven film, and it probably has the most characterization in an X-Men or spin of Wolverine film to date. This film does not hold back from a violence standpoint. From the get go, you know what type of movie you are in for. my opinion in future Hugh Jackman might change his mind comeback as Wolverine or next Wolverine should be Scott Adkins or Joe manganiello or Scott Eastwood or Taylor kitsch or Charlie Hunnam or Karl Ubarn or Jon Bernthal",9,3,8,15 March 2017
Elysium," Great Film Finally Matt Damon is in good Action-Sc Fi Movie
",it was very good movie wasn't to bad i liked District 9 but i think this did better for me because in this i liked the Robots and the movie it's like it's been filmed in Africa like District 9 but in this it's filmed in Mexico to me i am not to sure that's why it's same director who did District 9 did something different way same village and same houses same view of world and Matt Damon was pretty good as in Character Max was Awesome Because Matt Damon never did Action Movie like this for longtime i really hate Behind the Candelabra i am like Matt Damon Could do something Better i knew it Elysium was better then that crap and i like Matt Damon Bourne Franchise and The Departed and Green Zone and Jodie Foster was fine didn't do much in movie but she was OK Alice Braga was Really good i really love Alice Braga in I Am Legend and Predators she was really good in this movie i am like good actor she is in all movie i really like it her and the Villain Sharlto Copley District 9 and A-Team (2010) and as Character this is time was a bit Boring and he wasn't that good Villain but he was OK i love the Action Scenes and i like when he jumps with sword up then it was slow motion and part when Max Fights with Robot and Matt Damon and Alice Braga and Sharlto Copley was amazing and Jodie Foster i Didn't care for that Actor and Character all i care for Matt Damon Character and Movie and its fun fast placed and This is a very adult themed movie and packs in a lot of violence really good movie better then Total Recall (2012),9,3,5,3 September 2013
Don't Breathe," Don't Talk Give a Movie shot
","this was my blind date movie at theater i got free ticket to see movie, and i really loved it writing is so good it's 80's john carpenter style similar movie to It Follows (2014)but it's not supernatural thing, it's like less thriller but more of horror movie not because of jump scenes. i would say it's better then Evil Dead (2013) same lead actress who toke this role Sam Raimi one of my favorite directors but i could have add john carpenter for movie for writes or directed it, would be best idea As producer for him opinion of mine but it's Sam Raimi great director Evil Dead franchise. well it's better movie then Poltergeist (2015) i like throw up on it plus Sam Produce the movie, but then this Don't Breathe is better movie. the opening is great like John Carpenter style a lot of camera movement rotating camera. title comes up don't breathe like old school style 80's traditional new age 80's idea but no 80's music like guest or it follows different style. Plot:(Jane Levy)Rocky funny name for girl to name rocky not rocky balboa. She is a thief that breaks into houses and they sell the items that they steal for money with her thuggish partner(Money)Daniel Zovatto same actor who did it Follows(2014) and Alex(Dylan Minnette)they made plans to move out town but Alex can't go because he's dad want's to stay in town. Rocky dreams of escaping from life with her alcoholic mother and father Money Character Research about House They Were Going Into For Last Robbery For Night to Get Out town Money was doing some research of house that is ghost town where no lives in neighbor hood expect for 1 person they didn't know. Alex didn't agree with plan because they needed him Alex's dad works for a home security firm, Because Alex has access to house keys and insider information on how to bypass alarms. but he's doing it for rocky because he had feelings for her one night they broke into some random blind old man who was a Army veteran that lives in an abandoned Detroit neighborhood.lost his daughter in a car accident. Norman Nordstrom / 'The Blind Man' (Stephen Lang) they decide to break into the house at night. they were searching around house money but is unable to find it; assuming it is behind a locked door, Money shoots the lock. The noise wakes up the Blind Manstupid thing is why didn't money character just stepped back kill blind guy but Blind man kills money so it's more of surviving in a house invasion i would say it's better then Purge. no jumps scenes at all good story writing of film a lot gore but not much, i found this movie scary keeps you watching all the time knowing what's going to happen to next good twist of film some of great mystery staff in movie. i know characters ain't good guys but they are still likable Rocky, Alex were likable characters but they ain't good people but expect for money is big ass in film as character. shocking ending of film that what you thought that was going to happen next. but doesn't end up happen amazing plot twist and there is Disgusting scene that i won't explain it's not gore but it's something that you don't wanna read hear it's going to make you sick or make you throw up in front of your computer. it's really great movie i would highly recommend",8,2,6,23 September 2016
Sicario," In Mexico 'Sicario' Means Hit-man
","this is one of my type of crime movies with CIA and government task force Mexico style ever since if you loved any of these type of Mexican movies like Traffic witch had (Benicio Del Toro)and movie savages his best performances since traffic and savages. lead role is (Emily Blunt) is one of good actress i have loved Looper, Edge of Tomorrow now this great. Josh Brolin was great actor and great performance Sicario is better movie then Oldboy(2013)He's best movies i think he has made so far Sin City Dame to kill for, No Country for Old Man, Gangster Squad, Planet Terror, very good pace to movie very written well made film so cast of actors lots of gore, guns, drugs, CIA, Cartels specially it's visceral drug trade thriller pulls no punches in its grit there are movies had punching holes like The Counselor (2013) had lot of punching to movies but this movie was much better then Counselor witch had a lot of punching holes to movie.(Emily Blunt)Kate Macer, an FBI field agent plunged in the powerful world of a drugs cartel as well as she trying to make her way to get a better rank for herself. soon she agreed to work with CIA Government Kate and her partner (Daniel Kaluuya)Reggie Wayne Matt Graver (Josh Brolin)working together to try to bring down the kingpin of the cartel responsible. When things don't go as cleanly as she thought they would bringing a prisoner back from Mexico, she starts questioning Matt and soon mystery man Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) man maybe from CIA Also emerging from the shadows that no one knows who he really is appears to ignore established law enforcement protocols. but he is helping out the team Kate is wants to know who was he ? where did he come from he didn't look anything like CIA. Alejandro an enigmatic figure who is the sicario of the title - in other words a hit-man whom you never where he is going to turn up next or on whose side he will be. towards to scene it's mystery a must see film Fifteen years ago Steven Soderbergh's Traffic' which earned numerous Oscars, not the least of which went to Benicio Del Toro, made a clear statement about the various strands the drug trafficking business touches. Now, all those years later we see in Sicario' that even the faintest of hopes that Traffic' held onto havebeen eviscerated including Oliver Stone Movie Savages from 3 years ago witch went to Benicio Del Toro was a bad guy cartel character very cruel ruthless kidnapping girl for money ransom character in film made movie like Sicario he is unknown person works for CIA, that doesn't follow up where it really follows what is toro character is being mystery in film. The music built the suspense 10/10 i fell in love with this movie one of movie top movies in 2015 very well done made i can watch again again like Savages Sicario better get nominated for Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Supporting Actor and Best Lead Actress Emily Blunt and Del Toro",10,3,8,30 September 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians of The Galaxy Are Back with More Laughs With More Acton With More Cast
","this is one of hell of better sequel then first film never hated the first film i enjoyed the first film i really enjoyed but this is big sequel ever has been made with a lot more funny staff in film makes more laugh then first film, a lot more action in it, a lot of Guardians in film, a lot of story i am not going to write because you have to go and see the film for yourself if your big fan of First film and a lot famous actors playing Cameo's a lot of them i Enjoyed Cool Staff What's in Film the Sequel a lot actors I love cameo actors in it Plot is Always Simple I loved Plot it was very Interesting it shows back story not a lot back story but it shows before 8 years before Peter mother died of cancer in (1980) Ego (Kurt Russell) Escape from New York, The Thing,Tango Cash Ego was in love with Peter mother Meredith Quill encounters Ego who shows her an alien seedling he planted in the woods of Missouri in woods in Kurt Russell i am not going to write what type of character he is because of spoilers i will just keep that way he's performance was good in film not best character in my opinion but he did good in film he looked like he is having fun i liked him in film he did fine. story follows to present day they had action in start with the Guardians of the Galaxy – Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), (Zoe Saldana) Gamora,(Dave Bautista) Drax, (Bradley Cooper) Rocket, and baby Groot still is (Vin Diesel) character steals the show – are renowned as heroes after defeating Ronan the Accuser They are tasked by Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) leader of the Sovereign race, to defend a cache of valuable batteries from an inter-dimensional monster called the Abilisk. i would say her character is boring theirs noting to her character at all it's character you will hate to death she is pretty annoying character but you have funny moments when RocketTease's her it is so Hilarious funny things to her.The Guardians accept and complete the job in exchange for Nebula (Karen Gillan) Gamora sister, who was captured by the Sovereign following the Battle of Xandar from First Guardians of Galaxy film. When it's discovered that Rocket secretly stole several batteries for himself, the Sovereign send a fleet of drones to attack the Guardians' ship, the Milano. Drax going at back of ship shooting enemy's little drones that's great action scene giving Bautista something to do more he is in the all film but in fist he hasn't got much action scenes to do but anyway he does a lot in this film. I Like that Action Scene a lot more it was fun, they crashed into some planet nearby planet, where Ego (Kurt Russell) character appears in all movie with along side with new character Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and single-handed destroys all the drones. After revealing himself as his father, Ego invites Quill accompanied by Gamora and Drax, to his home In Moments you have Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) we all know he is Pain in butt in first film but in this they changed his character better in moment scene with Stakar Ogord / Starhawk (Sylvester Stallone) one of my Favorite Actors of all time. him and Michael Rooker Played each another Cliffhanger(1993) but in this film they both have scene together about A lifelong, high-ranking Ravager who has a history with Yondu In past with him and Starhawk sold him out he doesn't want him anymore. i am not going to share that detail what i liked about scene its strong performance i just really wish they got Sly & Michael in longer scene it's Strange because in my opinion Stallone doesn't suit for role for Guardians of Galaxy film not his type but he is their for paycheck he is not really in it maybe Director or writer's didn't give him much to do witch it's shame. About more to do and making more acting performance in film give sly to do more action alongside with Michael Rooker character i really wish that could happened. give Sly and Kurt acting again in this film they all played In One Film They Never Met Each Another Characters never did noting with them it would be cool if they scene with Sly and Kurt in this film have action fight scene or something or acting scene but anyway it doesn't happen. there were a lot of funny moments So you have many funny moments with Groot its so funny makes you laugh more. and this sequel i would say a lot more better not just because new characters or just because its new sequel all that it was just better and it was more fast Paced film it was Guardians are together the first film is great. idea of Michael Rooker Character more of good guy and he becomes character you hate in first film but in this you start to like him a lot great funny jokes makes you laugh out of you ass out of seat. there is something you should not miss towards at end of film there mid post-credit scenes and ending to it never miss something i never wanted to share. 10 out 10 its worth fun watching sequel of all of time i would say its a lot more better first film.",10,12,23,26 April 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," fast placed Action SC-FI Movie i ever saw close actions look a little bit too fast and hard to comprehend (SPOILERS)
","i enjoy this movie i really like it a really interesting movie Action SC-FI but more of American military science fiction film that looks like a bit like Aliens or Avatar noting like that absolutely IS an action-packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about battling an alien invasion (the trailers got that right), albeit one with a funny bone and great characters. that's why they made the trailers better because i thought it was a Action full fast placed the Aliens were awesome it looked awesome they were OK. good Actors good that they bought a good actor i liked Tom Cruise i think he was really good actor even specially every Tom Cruise Movies Has Perfect role like Mission Imposable Franchise, Jack Reacher, Oblivion, The Last Samurai one my favorite movies with Tom Emily Blunt is starting to become a bad ass girls like Gina Carino, Ronda Rousey, Angelina Jolie, Kelly Hu Emily was just Amazing, Awesome, Brave full metal b**ch Character (Bill Paxton) Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie True Lies, Aliens,Haywire,2 Guns, is playing role like a General playing role like in Aliens this it is and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy Luckily it is all the better for it. still Action movie but not like surviving but it is repeat if he dies he repeat because he got blood that he killed Omega Alien then As the Omega disintegrates Cage's body absorbs its blood he has power to stop the war that's why he repeats if he fails he will do it again he got the power good action scenes like Aliens with the robots special effects Tom Cruise running around killing the alien thousands of times Emily with the sword chopping them cutting them was Awesome Specially the car chasing when Tom Cruise was shooting the Alien while he is in car so there is car chasing with Alien scene was amazing awesome scene.If you haven't gone to see this movie, get there to the movie theater It's just great And no real surprise here, the concept art is absolutely gorgeous, channeling the gritty Starship Troopers-meets-Band of Brothers feel hard Plus, MORE ALIENS! 10 out 10 i liked this movie underrated i got use to it to the start i really like it i would own it on blu ray one day this is my tom cruise movies i really liked it !",10,1,4,17 June 2014
Wonder Woman," First Success Female Superhero film and its great worth seeing it
","when i say its a First Success Female Superhero film in DC Comics because last time A Female Version (2004) Catwoman Superhero film that has flopped got worst The film grossed $82 million on a $100 million production budget, making it a box office bomb. but this got a very great success for a first female Superhero film, officially a box office hero looking at a $100.5 million domestic opening weekend got Huge Success thank god this film has not BOMBED. 93% Rotten Tomatoes great rating i am like jeez got very popular. and its a about time tomake a Wonder Woman big screen has happened i am like why could of they make a wonder woman film back in 10 years now its about time for a BIGGER film in big screen not a low budget or short film, and its a fast pace flick not a slow boring taking time story it moves on and on. its similar mix of another films not DC a similar staff like Captain America First Avenger and Thor first film just similar things to it if you seen these films you will get what i say. Chris Pine does a great job with his character he is really art of film Gal Gadot and Chris Pine has a great chemistry together, and its a female director Patty Jenkins about time knows how and know to make a Wonder Woman film. plot Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) Born and raised on the island of Themyscira, the child Diana dreams of becoming an Amazonian warrior. and it has a great motivation scenes to movie its pretty strong lines in film witch i love the script the way how its written great but its great that they didn't make her a b*tch around or crying out loud being annoying. she focus of her goals to be a Amazonian Warrior but scene doesn't so takelong it gets to point she has a hero inside her self. the island where they shot was very nice place Palinuro Italy. (Connie Nielsen)Queen Hippolyta, tells Diana that their people were enslaved by mankind, who were corrupted by the god of war Ares. Ares also slaughtered his fellow gods on Mount Olympus, including his father Zeus. Zeus manage to defeat Ares, but is mortally wounded. Before dying, Zeus created Themyscira and left behind a weapon (apparently in the form of a ceremonial sword) capable of killing his renegade son. Diana rescues pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) does a great job for his role he is good hes character is bit like Steve Rogers Captain America he could be great role to fit in if Chris Evans didn't wanted to be in it. after his plane crashes off the coast of Themyscira The island is soon attacked by the German soldiers pursuing Steve. German solders comes in island The Amazon solders decide to fight against German soldiers. Diana leaves her home to try to stop the war. with Steve Diana arms herself with the ceremonial sword and leaves Themyscira with Steve to find and destroy and Isabel Maru / Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) A mad scientist who isassociated with General Ludendorff and specializes in chemistry and Elena Anaya poisons Ares. villains are Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) An ambitious and iron fisted general of the German Army during World War I he is eh i wish villains could be better the villain is pretty boring in my opinion i refer villain from First Captain America Red Skull Hugo Weaving character a lot more better Danny Huston character is bit weak villain. Ares (David Thewlis) is eh villain in my opinion is eh noting special, but the rest of film is fun Wonder woman does a lot of things a lot action a lot fun to movie. its never a slow boring pace film it moves on quicker that's how i should say it. and her costume is very well done i love her costume looks more realistic looks more of her Wonder Woman style of looks bit like metal amour but its not really of metal amour looking. its more realistic looking of costume, they is great scenes of wonder woman fighting against war and war Steve Trevor hires hes guys who fight war is Sameer (Saïd Taghmaoui), Charlie (Ewen Bremner), The Chief (Eugene Brave Rock) are great characters in film. and their is good action scenes Wonder Woman kicking German soldiers in butt great scenes. their is a lot strong Motivation that Gal Gadot says what she does her Motivation strong lines in movie her acting is great comes a surprise with her individual film. An incredible plot, entertaining from the first moment. Gal Gadot was born to play Wonder Woman, her performance was excellent, I love her! she does a great job as wonder woman. After the big surprise that gave Batman vs Superman film that includes wonder woman in her own movie. lucky film didn't fail at everyone but thank god it never failedeveryone and great success budget of film Batman vs superman works for me great but not for everyone but this may work on you better. better story and it has better direction to movie Gal Gadot Was BORN for this movie born for this role for wonder woman i think because they never made a big budget wonder woman film reason because they didn't want to hire a bad actress and lose budget and coast of film and that's why now its best time to make it with all Technology. the CGI explosions looked a bit fake and terrible to it like a low budget film Explosion looks but the film is still very well filmed and its great performance for gal Godot believe me if you really hated Batman vs Superman you will like this a lot more. 10 out 10",10,24,69,4 June 2017
Creed II," Rocky Defeated Drago now it's time for Creed to have his turn to Defeated Drago Son and this time it's personal
","Creed II is a very exacting sequel, and it's better compering with first film this is a lot more and much more excited i loved how they brought back everything still keeps it original with everything Creed II keeps up a lot of legacy's and this franchise to retired rocky to creed it keeps up their legacy. Dolph Lundgren is back as Ivan Drago in big screen and he has comeback to big screen before like Expendables franchise and comeback in films as cameos and TV shows. mostly he has been doing direct to DVD movies for awhile and comeback to this franchise as Ivan Drago with son character victor drago witch i think he is a better villain then to first creed 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan real boxer champion Tony Bellew, i don't care if he is a real boxer or not but i care about character this victor drago is a big tough machine but much scarier then to Ivan Drago. (Florian Munteanu) play's victor drago did a great job on his character he didn't say much not much of dialog he has like lundgren character when he say's if he dies he dies or i must break you. story follows three years after his loss to 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan from first Creed (2015), Adonis Creed (Michael B Jordan) scores a string of victories, culminating in a victory over Danny 'Stuntman' Wheeler (Andre Ward) to win the WBC World Heavyweight Championship. Danny Stuntman is in first Creed when he punched creed in first film and creed made a deal whoever wins takes his mustang well in this film he got his mustang back after 3 years he lost it, someone else got it now it's his feels like it's john wick car in the first john wick Russians stole his Mustang he doesn't get it back until in sequel in john wick 2 in opening he got his car back just like with this film funny feeling of this film when Adonis in first Creed he lost sparing match he made a bet if someone bets him and he does get knocked out then in sequel it's in actually boxing ring and guy Andre who has his mustang gave it back kinda same feeling of film. then after Adonis bet Andre in boxing match he got everything back to normal Now Adonis is a worldwide star, Adonis proposes to his girlfriend, Bianca Taylor, who agrees to marry him
but When Bianca suggests starting a new life together in Los Angeles, Adonis is reluctant to leave his life behind in Philadelphia. Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad) now after there's a new fighter who is built and tougher and born scarier fighter young fresh meat it's Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu) now he has not been in many movies he is in movie called Bogat (2016) now he got in a bigger role in this film. Meanwhile, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) in a former Soviet boxer who killed Adonis's father, Apollo Creed, in the ring thirty-three years earlier, sees an opportunity to regain the glory that was taken from him as a result of his loss to Rocky Balboa in Moscow later that same year by pittinghis son, Viktor Drago the Russian outcasts seeking redemption for the failures of Ivan Drago. Everyone has a purpose in this film, and everyone has a place in moving the narrative forward: avenging the actions of Rocky IV. people lost respect for Ivan Drago, he lost power, his wife kicked him out and son i don't know what reason, and scene with Rocky and Ivan where Ivan was in rocky restaurant at Adrian's Restaurant it looked intense way how Ivan looked at him looked full of rage anger to Rocky, Rocky was like what is he doing here ? it looked like you wanna watch entire scene great performance by Stallone and lundgren in that scene of movie it looked intense feels intense as well when you watch scene you can't never take your eyes of screen. and the way how this sequel is been made it's very It's so very deeply moving. Tears streamed my face during certain deeply meaningful scenes in this film. it's about winning but not really about winning and losing, either. It's about familial love, especially the love of fathers and sons, estrangement, loss, forgiveness, redemption, and reconciliation in film, The movie does very well of showing the other side of Drago. How life was for him after he lost to rocky balboa. Drago trying to undo his wrongs by living through his son. and creed is highly motivated as well in training, and redemption to take his revenge, this is remixing with Rocky IV continues with Creed II but this story should have maybe been in a first creed film, now this must have been tough for this franchise to go on sometimes but it doesn't feel like it needs a sequel or not people say would it be clubber Lang son or Tommy gun son ? who knows its hard for Sylvester Stallone for him now to think about this franchise to know how it will continue for him or directors and writers for him to know how would they make all creed films in a trilogy. in this film it there is a lot of comebacks a lot of it more then first Creed film because in first one their was comeback like for explame the footage from old Rocky movies or story takes place after all rocky films and last Rocky Balboa movie, continues to Creed now it's continuing to Creed II. who know's maybe this is end of franchise or it will continue it who knows really ? but this film was a great comeback and remixing Rocky IV all together bringing back Dolph Lundgren in big screen again as Ivan Drago. 10.10 it was great experience in theater don't miss out, don't wait until it comes out blu ray go pay ticket now and see it go it's a great film believe me you don't wanna miss this film in big screen you only live once in your life.",10,1,3,3 December 2018
The Purge," I Think you should read this before you go see this movie (SPOLIER)
","well i rent it this movie last week before end of 2013 In the year 2022, the United States has become a nation reborn thanks to the New Founding Fathers of America. Crime and unemployment rates are hitting an all-time low due to the government having instituted an annual 12-hour period called the Purge during which all criminal activity including murder, theft, and rape and Hospital is out of it so there is no Emergency's if this happen about the Purge of people murdering anthers why doesn't the rich people get out of there ? move to another country, (Ethan Hawke)character wasn't much good was good i like his movies, the film is not great because i think it is so cheap film, Villain was like strangers (2008) Director toke idea of that movie with strangers as killers going to there house with clown mask all that make up is lame there is noting to do this movie no likable characters all of them are terrible they don't do much movie is more of time waster just some little action horror scenes noting good. there is movie called Judgement Night it is film like this but much better i thought the writing of movie it didn't write well what i mean it didn't write well. no likable characters expect the bloody stranger he was good i go for him because he was more of character like hard target navy seals got poor they going after him to Family House. i wish this movie did better i hate this movie time waster, likable character noting is interesting in this movie just time for noting. this movie reminds me of Assault on Precinct 13 (2005)toke idea out of movie to put it to this movie ? really i am not that stupid to notice that Ethan Hawke knew the director is the writer of that movie, directed this movie this is like Assault Precinct 13 but without cops, all that i mean like Rather than being scary, tense or exciting it was just incredibly irritating watching characters doing the most stupid things throughout that made you repeatedly ask the question 'WTF did they do THAT for ? the writing does not make sense no Likable Characters, Boring, not scary, it doesn't deserve a sequel i have no idea why ? this was waste of time this movie.",2,0,0,1 January 2014
Godzilla," It Could Done Better (Spoilers)
","i enjoyed this movie i think it was fun for me i just like to watch Godzilla the thing is the movie goes for 2 hours long not fast placed but everyone hated the Godzilla (1998) overall the storyline story line. but a bit boring and too serious story and we don't see Godzilla much... just him fighting with Muto was good Godzilla in the best way i liked he blows the lighting blue lighting or blue fire was amazing thing i liked, but this didn't make any sense how does it make sense for the female MUTO to remain dormant without showing any sigh of life when it was examined by the scientists ? how the hell is the male MUTO still be smaller than the female after it has matured ? and why doesn't any of those nuclear bombs explode when the MUTOs ate them ? why wouldn't they launch a nuclear missile on some remote area to draw them out but instead have to transport a bomb by land ? i watched movie i said that in my mind without listing to another people oh best movie ever it is realistic that's why people don't know care for what makes sense or what story is just make it realistic and make it better come on you got to put what makes sense in movie. Aaron Taylor Johnson come on really ? that actor Kick Ass (2010) Savages (2012)wasn't guy who suit for main role in movie everyone said he was boring i can tell come on they were going to choose Joseph Gordon Levitt, Henry Cavill these guys could been better then Aaron Taylor Joesph Gordon and Henry were going to be main they were going to get these actors to be main but comprised the shortlist for the role before Legendary took interest in Taylor-Johnson WTF that is big problem why could of Byran Cranston could been main role in film why could old people be main role why ? Byran Cranston was the greatest Performance ever then Aaron Taylor Johnson no Performance for that guy i say he was just boring no acting his acting is not very series in movie he's acting is more like kick ass Byran Cranston was a fan of Godzilla he has been fan of Godzilla in His Childhood but why could Byran could been Main Role if he was main it could been better like Breaking Bad. it was always hes favorite monster movie That f**king pisses me off how they killed off the best actor within the first 30 minutes! I always liked Bryan Cranston as an actor because of Breaking Bad, Drive but i know this is clichéd but after Breaking Bad he became one of my favorite actors because he can make you sympathize, fear and laugh with a character and he is always believable in every role no matter how shitty a movie is! he is usually the best part. f**k why couldn't he have been the lead! oh here's why because hes a 58 year old man not a 22 year old straight out of the CW actor. well that's bull crap! when did men stop being the leads in movies and boys became it! f**k if i was a movie director which i really want to be and i had Bryan Cranston in my cast i would make him the f**king lead because he has the most talent. F**king hell give the older guys a chance instead of these untalented CW/Abercrombe runway model types! ﻿there is good shots in movie when Aaron Jumps off the plane with the red flares flying around jumping down wow Godzilla there is good CGI but to much, This movie was awesome, this ending was funny too. But people complaining about it so much were expecting the whole movie to be literally nothing but action and a bunch of cgi. Most people don't even know what they want in movies anymore. But this movie stayed true to the old Godzilla movies, and the other monsters being on screen more than Godzilla has happened plenty of times in movies like Godzilla vs Destroy. The build up for Godzilla is what made it so epic, and the atomic breath really made the movie there is less Godzilla just more Characters not really slow burn but there is not many great characters i enjoy this movie but i give it 6/10 it could done better because it is 2 hour movie 5 or 7 minutes Godzilla was in it he less in it he needs to be more in movie Main Role wasn't great or good just lame it would better if Byran Cranston as main role it doesn't matter if he is old or not old give it shot they could got Josh Brolin or Aaron Paul it doesn't matter if character is got to be 22 year old it is the performance of acting Aaron Taylor is more Comedy not in Series movies he didn't suit in role very well Byran Cranston will suit better for main role this movie needs more Godzilla",6,1,3,15 July 2014

Plot: continues with Legendary John Wick (Keanu Reeves) in opening of film it's so epic he goes hunts for place to find his car that place Where people are taxi drivers and drug dealers sending drugs to taxi drivers where they take drugs some place Else, In Opening Guess Who Did Constantine with Keanu Reeves(Peter Stormare)Abram his character was not really in it as much he was only in it for 5 minutes of movie hes character played nephew of Iosef Tarasov the one who killed his dog and stole his car, and hisbrother to main villain from first film Viggo Tarasov is hes brother he was worried and pissing his pants thinking if John is going to kill him the opening is great he gets his car back 1969 Mach 1 Mustang from first film he Drive's and Slaright Killing Bad guys Killing them he gets his own starts to drive away but the Taxi Drivers He's Getting Chased Buy These Russian guys chasing him with Taxi's crashing into him he just hits them so bad. after that epic opening Scene, Aurelio(John Leguizamo)is not really in it but he saw John car he is going to repair that's Leguizamo scene only in it for 3 Minutes and Story Direction Tells About his wife and YES the dog is Fine Same Dog He Picked Up at end of first film and new villain witch again noting special about Villain i wish it could be Michael Wincott from Crow as Villain but anyway its Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) is main villain and His Henchman or Henchgirl(Ruby Rose)Ares as always she has done noting her character never talks just sign language he character is not much or it she is really not in it so yeah i like when the sign Language subtitles Pops up i like colors in subtitle makes it looks creature. Santino wants to hire John Wick to do mission and John wants to stay retired but he cant retire because he is committed to be Hit-man but he is not that guy anymore, so they destroyed his home and he is now in contact that everyone wants to kill him for $7 Million dollars soanyone who can kill him... and action scenes kill streaks are more deadly then first film, guns are better, epic the movie was complete Action Fast Placed Movie that Action Fans and its so everyone forget about GET OUT this film has its talent awesome and the music was perfectly chosen Le Castle Vania and film Everyone would Enjoy and location. soundtrack of film i would say its a lot better i am not saying first film is lame or anything just the location In Italy at Rome and underground shooting scene was so great well shot. Heres Common are you working again? you have great fight scenes Between John and Cassian a lot of it, well shot great between them again in round 2 in Train now everyone this isn't SPEED 3 in train they were fighting so great fight, another epic Action scenes just go and see it not even going to tell or write about these Action Scenes its WAY BETTER if you just see it. because writing and telling it makes a lot like me taking everything away from this film. (Lawrence Fishburne) character you don't see him until 40 Minutes of film but he doesn't have Red or Blue Pill to go back to Matrix Franchise or stay in John Wick seeing these 2 actors back makes it great i like the way they cast Matrix Actors in it Makes It Very Interesting they still have a good chemistry together but this film Buy my rating its 10 OUT OF 10 no matter what its a great film great Chemistry with action scenes, very brutal action scenes great scenes well perfect shots i highly recommend seeing it.. don't worry Everyone Chad Stahelski is sharping his pencil to Direct John Wick 3 stay tuned",10,2,5,21 May 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," I Thought Fury Road Was Better Sequel then Beyond Thunderdome
","i was always been Fan of mad max Mel Gibson road warrior was awesome movie and 1st movie. George miller mastermind director who Returns with budget big BANG in his mind Mad Max: Fury Road. First of all, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR.i have met (Greg Van Borssum) Ripsaw Imperator / The Breakman Assistant Director he was one of The Bullet Farmer group Actor,Stunts. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy)Max Rockatansky A Survivor, is captured by the War Boys Later On (Charlize Theron)Imperator Furiosa was driving heavily armoured War Truck Rig to collect gasoline but war boys decide to chase the truck the sandstorm scene where everyone drives into was pretty awesome scene Max is killing and punching people jumping every cars, then (Nicholas Hoult)Nux i thought he was bad guy but later on he becomes good guy Join With Max and Imperator with another girls with her The Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington Whiteley)pregnant with baby,Capable,The Dag,Cheedo the Fragile,Toast the Knowing.Max a man of action and of few words Furiosa, a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homeland with Max. Villain was (Hugh Keays Byrne)Immortan Joe he sounds like Bane his voice because the mask is covering his month up tom hardy role Dark Knight Rises mask with awesome skull. Immortan Joe and is war boys going after Max and Imperator Furiosa with gang girls driving gasoline truck action had no bad cgi with 150 budget had good cgi, good stunts to the movie good shooting, fighting was awesome jumping to each another different cars was very insane sorry about Ford Falcon XB GT get's destroyed but shame how the car wasn't in the all movie until the half way mask i liked, he was in first (Mad Max 1979)film playing villain again in fury road witch is good still i thought Immortan Joe was more better villain then Toecutter Original film.Immortan Joe was and war boys going after i thought the action scenes were non stop excellent gore to movie i thought it was going to be R Rated but it was MA 15 plus. It has all the intensity and perversity of the MAD MAX and THE ROAD WARRIOR, but amped up to new heights of craziness. i thought the action scenes were MUCH better then Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) this was little bit action scenes of road warrior with different story,characters noting relates to the original, that would have happened if (Mel Gibson)Max Rockatansky never got kicked Out warner bros studio because that Mel Gibson got into series trouble with his life. he can't go back to warner bros it's not his age Mel Gibson was going to be in 4th Fury Road but he failed studio kicked him out dismissal. shame i loved Mel Gibson to Comeback in Sequel but shame everyone before when this movie was made no Mel Gibson no Mad Max but i knew they were going to make Mad Max But no Mel Gibson after he got kicked out Studio not working with Warner Bros anymore, but still i thought this movie still kicked a lot of ass i recommended this movie to every action fan like mei was always waiting for Mad Max Sequel to come with Mel Gibson i thought Mel Gibson was a Better character then Tom Hardy sorry i wasn't huge fan of (Tom Hardy)i did enjoy Tom Hardy as actor but still i don't get the choice that tom plays max ? wasn't Sam Worthington was going to be mad max at first person i really like to see that. i don't have problem with Tom Hardy but he is not much of my actor, i thought i liked this movie a very fast placed, lots of blood and gore, lots action car crazy stunts in movie graphics looked so good like video game almost. 8.10 can't wait for sequels hopefully it would come out soon 2 more sequels to go ! i thought it was fun flick to watch but noting is same without Mel Gibson",8,2,9,31 May 2015

After Dominic went to Tokyo he meet Sean Boswell(Lucas Black)was only in 5 minutes in movie but i wanted him to be in all movie talking about Han all that. after Han funeral Dominic has meet and starting to work with (Kurt Russell)Mr.Nobody Escape From New York (1981) Thing (1982)was a lot in movie not much but lot only 50 minutes on movie. Dominic and crew are involved to get Deckard and Ramsey and (Djimon Hounsou) Jakande (Nathalie Emmanuel) Ramsey Game of Thrones (2011)Action scenes with cars flying around was even awesome and amazing idea and crazy thing to do with that. (Tony Jaa)Kiet Protector (2004), Ong Bak Franchise the fight scenes was just EPIC i loved Tony Jaa kicked a lot of ass in movie he was only 40 minutes in 5 scenes you will enjoy the ride in movie fighting with Paul Walker character Brain O Connor funny scene is when Dominic and Ramsey in car they got trapped a a lot of man around Dominic in funny dialog get Hamlet not for Dominic ? ha ha he will be fine yeah right ? After in great location Abu Dahbi crew had steal flash drive containing God's Eye i loved the Party in movie it looked so fantasy. (Ronda Rousey)Kara Fighting with Michelle Rodriguez went for 30 minutes not very long but the girl Bi*th fight was really awesome to see the only part that i laughed i said bulls*it is that Dominic and Brain were in car driving threw 3 building was crazy idea i have ever head but it was so unreal and too much CGI way too Much of scene Remember Fast And Furious was no CGI I Know Back Then the technology is different. i thought the Action Scenes with Jason Statham vs Vin Diesel at car park EPIC but rip off scene when Dominic gets car drives off helicopter in air drives off AGAIN Die Hard 4 (2007). at end it become so sad at very end it was like Heaven at end of movie with Paul Walker i don't WANT TO SPOIL MOVIE EVERYONE. the director (James Wan) Director FAST 7,Death Sentience,Saw,Insidious i mean i wasn't big of was in right direction but still not the right director for it i mean Justin Lin was the right one he directed more of franchise but who would bring James Wan he is best for Horror movies thriller not this lucky he didn't kill the movie and franchise but some things i got disappointed with CGI and Unreal scenes you might forget about movie the next day because it's like Expendables without story it's only about Actors and Script, the cars in movie very awesome packed full of cars, explosions, and ridiculous stunts go and see this movie in theaters last Paul Walker Movie seeing furious 7 makes me sad puts me in tears. that we lost Paul walker so tragically he didn't deserved to die this movie is my top movie in (2015) R.I.P this is the One Last Movie one Last Ride for you 1973-2013 10.10 for Paul Walker",10,2,17,3 April 2015
