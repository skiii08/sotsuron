Vertigo," Showing its age
","This may once have been a great film, but it's aging badly. The film would have been much better had it dealt wholly with Kim Novak as Madeleine Elster, but throwing in Novak as Judy Barton is a barely believable add-on to what should have been a wonderfully mysterious plot about a woman obsessed with her deceased great-grandmother.It's also unfortunate that Barbara Bel Geddes was totally wasted in this film. Perhaps pining quietly for a guy who doesn't have his act together (Jimmy Stewart) was the way liberated career women acted in the 1950s  I don't know  but I kept hoping that she would punch him in the face and tell him to grow up.Compared to 'Rear Window', which is still strong and fresh, 'Vertigo' seems like it has one foot in the grave.",9,4,10,31 March 2005
Requiem for a Dream," Film-making tour de force, but where's the character development?
","A film-making tour de force of style, 'Requiem' is ultimately exploitation masquerading as art. Apart from the glitz and glamor of the cinematography and editing, where is the character development? Where are the twists and turns in the story? Where are the delightful surprises that great films always give us?Were it other than a straight linear, chronologically ordered record of four characters' steady descent into hell, it might be more than a simple diary of the times.Students wanted me to show this in my film class this past semester. Sometimes I will show films I have not previous viewed. This time I chose not toI'm glad I made the right decision.",7,2,4,5 May 2005
Citizen Kane," No longer 'the best film of all time'
","I have shown 'Citizen Kane' several times to my film classes, and the result is universally the same: So what?And they're right. While the film may have broken ground in its day, like Kane himself it's aging not-so-gracefully in the 21st century.The acting is stilted  especially Joseph Cotton's. The scenes sometimes go on way too long. The music is ponderous.As film history it's still a gem. But as measured by current cinema standards it's getting a bit senile. I look forward to the day it slowly slides from '10 best' lists so that I no longer feel compelled to show it to introductory film students.UPDATE (12/26/07)That day has come  that is, I know longer show 'Citizen Kane' to introductory film students, though sometimes I allow them extra credit for viewing it on their own. The film I show instead from the same era is 'Casablanca', which receives much better reviews from this generation of audiences, especially young women.",9,1,8,31 March 2005
Shakespeare in Love," A must for Shakespeare addicts (provided they have an open mind)
","Why this film is so lowly rated on IMDb, I don't know. It is one of my favorite films of all time, and this comes from a guy who, has acted in a lot of Shakespeare.What disappoints me about the study of Shakespeare is how narrowly the 'traditionalists' have boxed him into an acceptable academic definition. Their knowledge, while expansive, still confines them into a incestuous body of research wherein one source feeds upon another ad infinitum.I prefer the broader approach taken by this film — from one of the most marvelously crafted screenplays ever — portraying Shakespeare as almost an accidental genius. And yes, the world has experienced many.I haven't read all the comments on the film but can only assume that those who dislike it do so because it challenges the status quo of the Shakespeare myth and canon. Yet Shakespeare IN LOVE is not meant to be history: It's meant to be entertainment.And this is what Shakespeare would have wanted.",10,1,2,21 February 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," A Disappointment
","For those who have not read the book or seen earlier versions of the story (like me), I'm sure this film will be a big disappointment. It certainly was for me and for many others in the mostly senior citizen audience in the near-packed theater in Palo Alto I attended, judging from the remarks I overheard afterwards. The problem is the nonlinear story and the lack of firm definition of all the characters. They are recognizable by face but not by name. Which one is Alleline, Esterhase, Bland, Haydon? We get them by the end, but during the film one wonders who is whom and what's with all these other people? And later, how does Ricki Tarr fit in? And perhaps most of all, how does Prideaux survive his wounds after we saw his body lying in a reservoir-sized pool of blood?Beautifully filmed and generally sparingly acted, technically it's wonderful. But if the story is confusing to most of the audience — my two companions, one 40 and the other 86, had to ask me what went on — then I can only classify it as a failure.",7,2,4,1 January 2012
City of God," College students love this film
","I have shown this film in my classes at Minnesota State University Mankato and offered it as an assignment and extra credit. Either way, it is perhaps the only film of the dozens I've shown that my predominantly Midwestern students have universally liked. For some — maybe even most — it may be the first non-English language film they're ever seen.And for a bonus it is a great educational tool: Yes, it demonstrates vividly that great films are made outside of the U.S. Yes, the cinematographic and editing choices offer a cornucopia of styles. Yes, the music and soundtrack are not secondary but help drive the film in its relentless pace. Yes, the ensemble cast, many of whom are amateurs from the favelas where the film is set, bring each character to life with compelling definition.Yes, the film exemplifies the classic three-act structure with hook, plot points, Shakespearian-style midpoint, climax and denouement. Yes, it sails thru its 130 minutes yet ends at just the right time. And all this in one film.With an educational tool like CITY OF GOD, my job as a film professor becomes astonishingly easy.",10,1,3,24 January 2012
The Green Mile," In watching 'The Green Mile' again on TV... stunned
","I rarely contribute to imdb.com. However, I teach film, write, and consult on scripts. I caught  'The Green Mile' on TV the other night and was stunned. I had seen it before, yet the power  of its story, especially personified by its characters, was mesmerizing. Prison films are inherently a tough sell. Yet some of our best cinema has come from this very  specific genre: 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'The Usual Suspects' (partially), 'Cool Hand  Luke', and, in fact, 'A Man for All Seasons'. 'The Green Mile', with its mix of realism, magic, and spirituality, represents the best in  classic storytelling. That it could be captured on film so well, defying by modern marketing  standards an instant attraction to young audiences and yet succeed in capturing them, gives  testimony to great writing, filmmaking and acting.",9,0,1,17 March 2004
