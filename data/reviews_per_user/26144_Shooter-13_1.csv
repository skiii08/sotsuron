Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I'm a college kid...
","...and I got tickets to see Episode One on Friday.  Today (Wednesday), I got jealous that my friends were going to see the movie before I did.  So I sat in front of my friend's computer and watched the second trailer for upwards of an hour and a half.  Then I decided that I had to see it.  Here's what I said during the movie,'Stop!  He just cut Darth Maul the f--- in half!'This movie is wonderful.  You should go see it.  Now I'm running around the dorm cutting people up with a lightsaber that - I think - must have been purchased in 1977 when Star Wars came out and I wasn't born.The only gripe I have is that that horrible Jar Jar Binks should have been gruesomely killed, but aside from that (and even with the wreched, vile Jar Jar), this is the best movie ever.
