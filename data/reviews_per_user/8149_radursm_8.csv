The Ring," A good surprise
","Well, I'm not too much for horror movies, but this one is much better than most of them. It begins as a common movie, I was about to leave the watching scene, but afterwards begins to develop a plot in a very interesting way. I didn't understand some of the logic of the plot, but I guess it's a pattern of this type of movies. I liked it. For what it does, it's really intriguing. It's not boring, not stupid, not predictable (pretty rare, huh?), and a bit more sophisticated than the common Dracula+Ghost+Dragons+Monsters+Aliens+Fallen Angels+Dark+Sprits+Curses+masks+evile persons+blahblahblah common stories. It is good!",8,1,1,16 June 2003
Lost in Translation," Actors are very good, the script is exceptional, the photography has quality...
","Probably one of the best movies made in the last 10 years... I'm not exagerating. Try to imagine some of the best European movies (Russian, Italian, French, German, British, Eastern European, Scandinavian and so on), try to combine all the nice style you've seen in valuable movies, think of the American cinema, and especially the art movie, put more spice, realism, drama, stylish humor, and you have a recipe for this kind of movie. Yes, I believe it is incredible to see a movie of such beauty...Actors are very good, the script is exceptional, the photography has quality... And the music, also, amazing.It is a must! 10/10",10,1,2,27 February 2004
Man of Steel," Originally mixing of old recipes.
","You take 2 teaspoon of 'Matrix: Revolutions', 1 and 1/2 of 'Independence Day', 1 of 'The Avengers', 1 of 'The Matrix', 1/2 of 'Transformers', 1/2 of '2012'. In a large bowl (a.k.a. DC Comics Universe), mix together the cake mix, season it with a bit of 'The Hulk', ad a flavour of 'Riddick' and sprinkle a bit of '2010 - Space Odyssey', just a bit (the satellite dishes scene). Butter it with a cheap scriptwriting (as if it were a story for 6-9 yrs. old), bake it while using a decent soundtrack and ornate it with a good cast (Matrix, West Wing, plus, you have: Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne). There you go: 'Man of Steel', a movie that is not extraordinary at all. Enjoyable, though, should you spend an evening, however not pretentiously relaxing.",7,0,1,28 June 2013
Avengers: Infinity War," I expected more
","Not everything that glitters is gold! I'd say this often to the script-writers of the past years successful SciFi franchises. I mean, not every story that ends dramatically is profound, good or emotional. You do not become a name of the universal literature if you repeated the recipe with Romeo and Juliet. Neither applauded, nor famous, even rejected by some, and, definitely, you would polarize the audience. On the other hand, you get some franchise fans who will accept you uncritically, guardians of everything that's included in the story. Look at what's happening with Star Wars.
Returning to Avengers, I see the scenario getting out of the accepted framework: they gave us 18 movies with the heroes of the Marvels universe (and movies about them) to kill them suddenly, unbalanced, easily.
The last 'Avengers' resembles an episode of Dr. Who (older). I paraphrase it: in the last episode they destroyed the universe to revive it the following season.
Yes, it would seem. Although, there are some excuses for the TV series: the time crisis, the continuing production for several months (each season), the pressure of the producers, or of the heads of the TV station. The Rock-n-roll machine.But the 'Avengers' franchise had almost everything: a huge budget, PR, enormous production resources, an army in the back.
'Infinity War' is not even that movie that you can say about: is not so bad that if you take it out from the bigger story, it could be OK, but it ruins the larger universe ... No. It's a dry sum of mini-stories (for the many characters), some of them gathered together to die like fools.
I quote a friend: What's the fool, the one who wrote the screenplay or the one who laughed at the jokes of the 'Guardians of Galaxy'?",1,269,658,3 May 2018
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," More than a parody, more than pithoresque: anti-boring and anti-stereotypes
","I remember a line in an exceptional TV Series: Northern Exposure: `Put a nice car, put a beautiful lady, and you got a movie. What else do you need?' Back to Kill Bill, I believe it's an extraordinary combination of what you need for a wonderful movie, along with what you need for a bad movie, altogether. And here you are: the Masterpiece! A movie that reminds us of Manga, of Matrix, of Martial Art movies, of Police/ Detective-thrillers, of never-aging myths of revenge, betrayal, and all the non-sense Tarantino is so able to observe and laugh at, a movie that puts us in front of what we see, like or dislike (or fake either of them - as snobbish persons) most of the time when we go to cinema, rent a movie or watch TV. I am grateful to Q&U for giving us this excellent movie. It is a 10 /10, not because we see a rare art movie, but because I welcome the aesthetes. And I welcome the irony, the comic, the bad taste against the bad taste (would it be the real revenge in this series?), the perfectly matched music, and, of course, the Actors and the Actresses.As for the rest, you know Tarantino: black humor, violence, perverts, details of everyday-life next to amazing events (huge crimes, wars, rapes, murders, whatever you want.) in a paradox we all accept (it's Holywood, after all!).Ah, and to emphasize another major issue, I must say: Uma Thurman is more beautiful than ever! She is amazing all the time, but here, as 'The Bride'...So, the recipe of this movie is so complex that you must see it to have an idea.I gratefuly thank all the people involved for this movie.Domo arrigato gozaimas, Radu-san",10,0,1,25 February 2004

The Matrix Reloaded," Some issues
","With the effect that `The Matrix' had on me, I should say that `. Reloaded' is not great at all. Some scenes are hilarious by their triviality: - The Karate ones are far beyond the Chinese movies (that only a fan of this kind of movies could tolerate), even though technically better-made - The `philosophical discourse' is rather ridiculous. If `The Matrix' was implied by post-modern criticism on Media (ref. Baudrillard), the speeches on causality, prophecy, destiny, and so on in `Reloaded' are rather a cheap blah-blah-blah - Somehow it reminded me of many other movies: Independence Day (Morpheus at the Temple and the US President at the military base), Aliens (Zion Defensive System vs. killing the Alien Queen); Doctor Quinn - The medicine woman (The bullet extraction and the brain surgery the woman made in the 19th century in the middle of nowhere), Star Wars (POD Race and the highway) - The `vision of Matrix' made by the green ASCII characters is too funny to take it! And the Oracle body-guard, what to say, has shiny yellow characters!!! - Even the music repeats from the first in the series! (at least during some scenes) - In the scene against the Smiths one can see that the guy is NOT Keanu Reeves! (Of course it's not him! But a better make-up of the stunt was required!) - The Superman thing is incredible! They could've thought of something better! - No mystery! No thrill, only waiting for the end! - Trinity's jealousy was out of nothing, but ridiculous.I am sorry to have so many negative comments. I was a fun of `The Matrix' (I watched it more than 35 times, I have the videotape and the DVD, whatever else materials regarding it, even 2 DIVx versions on CD's). I watched Reloaded a couple of times; to be sure I see a sequel of that masterpiece instead of some naive follow-up. I am sad of concluding that the movie is worse than any pessimistic expectation. Besides the charm of the plot, the talent of the actors, it is only a Karate movie, with Sci-Fi in it, and FX. Lots of FX. Unfortunately, no one can be told what `The revolutions' will bring to us, but I have all my hopes in it, in order to repair the shameful mistake.",7,0,0,8 June 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Addictive, but still clumsy (Some spoilers)
","Lots to be said about the movie. Better or worse than the previous, none can really say, unless you watch it a couple of times. As previous people here, on IMDb, said, Welcome Back, Mr. Lucas! Glad to see the starships, battlecruisers, light sabers, the unique sound of the engines and so on. However, I want to criticize the forced manner they made the script about Anakin's conversion. Not that we didn't expect, but Palpatine shows himself suddenly, and just asks: Join the Dark Side! I think it was obviously because the script writers had to overcome the lack of complexity with another lack of complexity. I was uneasy to see some events that have a pace and that others have a different one. I don't know, I am not a writer, but it felt a bit childish, the same error as the Attack of the Clones movie, which made me think I was watching a kid playing computer games rather than watching a SW movie. And then, the same Anakin does things (I repeat, not that we didn't expected to) in such a hurry. Now he is the same restless padawan, then, suddenly, the vengeful and naïve frustrated padawan and the, just like that, Darth Vader himself. The authors wanted to link the stories in such a way that they forced the SW logic, at least the one I expected. Or it is the first time I watched it. I don't know. Still a bit too 'juvenile', even for an old fan (the movies of my childhood were 'A new Hope' and 'Empires strikes back'). But for the sake of all what SW means, it is a wonderful movie. 9 of 10",9,1,4,20 May 2005
