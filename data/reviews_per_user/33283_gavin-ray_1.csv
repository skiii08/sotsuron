The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," This movie freaking sucks.
","I gave this movie a three instead of a 1 or 2 because I want to finger this movie by giving it the Mockingjay symbol. For 1, this movie completely ruins any badassery that JLaw had. She cries 10 times this whole movie, I counted. She won The Hunger Games, twice, (technically) and she still cries like a bitch. Next, they make one of the worst songs ever. The song is 80% 'Are you'. Thank God Lorde was here to recover the soundtrack for a brief time. Rolling along, This movie has no action for like 70-85% of the whole thing. Moving on, they make Prim seem like she doesn't have a care in the world for anything. She goes back for ButterCup, and seems to neglect anything that doesn't involve her cat. She has no sense of urgency in that scene. And finally (for now) Peeta should be nicknamed Pemis. He has no balls at all. He fights for literally anyone at all, the only time he seems to have some is when he tries to kill Katpiss, and we all wish that would happen.That is why I hated this movie.",3,3,4,4 July 2015
