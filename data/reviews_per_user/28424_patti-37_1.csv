Mission: Impossible III," Really enjoyed it!
","The movie was exciting from start to finish. Tom Cruise really puts himself out to give the audience their money's worth. He worked very hard on this movie and did his own stunts. I felt exhausted just watching him. Definitely worth the money. All of the actors did a great job. It's the best movie I've seen in quite awhile, and I see a lot of movies.I enjoyed Mission Impossible 1 and 2, but I like Mission Impossible 3 the best and my husband likes Mission Impossible 3 the best too. I got so nervous watching the movie, I almost ripped the arm out of my husbands shirt. Will be buying this one too. Patti",10,2,4,7 May 2006
