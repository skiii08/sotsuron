Angels & Demons," A well made fiction with historical flaws
","As a suspense film I value for its entertaining value. But on the facts of bad Italian and the picturing of Cardinals smoking and a very well shaped young priest as the secretary to the pope (a highly unlikely coincidence)who does not speak Italian well (pronunciation mistakes) and some of the should-be-Italians pronouncing Italian badly render the film a bad and unauthentic taste. Anyway as a person who studies in Italy and who speaks English and Italian, the language barrier (on the part of the actors who act as Italians) was a major flaw. Apart from that the capturing of scenes in the inner walls of Vatican was amazing and is commendable. It's almost impossible to access the inner walls of the Vatican and to be able to see these things (even if they may be wrong up to some extent-I am not an expert on it) is amazing. Overall the film is a very well done and very well acted out fiction, but that which lacks historical credibility.",7,0,1,4 July 2010
