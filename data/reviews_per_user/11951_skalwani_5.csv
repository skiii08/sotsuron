Blade Runner 2049," Very well done extension of the original
","I got to see this at a select preview. I had seen the original many many years ago, so I vaguely recalled the plot when I sat down to view this. The entire movie was very engaging and I could follow the story development without any problem. Excellent sound track, heightens the desired effects. Excellent acting by Ryan Gosling, who goes through a whole range of emotions, ups and downs, surprises and shocks. Very tight script and full of intrigue. Some might argue very dark portrayal, but that is the idea. Very realistic depictions of the landscape, brilliant CGI work all through the movie.Highly recommended as a science fictional potential look at a future of society.",9,3,10,8 October 2017
The Danish Girl," Portrait of a very difficult to understand subject
","The movie - based on the book 'Man Into Woman', a diary kept by one of the first person to go thru a trans-gender experience, dictate the pace of the whole movie. Both Alicia and Eddie give excellent performances, bringing to the surface their emotions and tragic gut wrenching journey of their feelings. It does however capture the essence of the times (1920s Europe) of how society viewed this and the utter lack of knowledge of the medical establishment at the time. I did not expect much from the movie and was pleasantly surprised by the crisp editing, transitions, and attention paid to era details. Worth a watch just to appreciate the tough times in the early days. The movie does have good closure towards the end, even if it is a bit tragic.",7,0,2,29 December 2015
Suicide Squad," Whacky trippy badass characters brought to life
","I went in to see this movie without any bias or pre-conceived notions, so I do feel qualified to share my review. Not having read or even being aware of the DC Comics version, I did not know what to expect. I liked the movie as it had a lot of good action from the get go, so the 2 hours passed quickly. The movie helped build up the story giving each of the major characters a build up. It did feel like a little bit of 'Ghostbuster' but only fleetingly so.Critics may have panned the movie, but I enjoyed it. Lots of color, good CGI, did not feel fake. The sound effects were very good. The language and script, screenplay were alright for this sort of genre. Plenty of light direct humor, nothing too cerebral. Plenty of trippy and whacky badass characters to satisfy even the folks who wish for balance and gender diversity. A few parts did seem puzzling, but you can enjoy the movie nonetheless.",7,2,4,10 August 2016
Rush," One of the most realistic F1 racing movies
","I saw it and tried to post a comment on the official facebook timeline, but somehow it got lost.... Anyways here goes my review: RUSH has got to be one of the best made sports movies for 2013, no question about it. Without revealing any spoilers here -it gets the highest rating for telling a great story and delivering it with style, very reflective of the period. Special effects were limited but tastefully done. Ron Howard did a masterful job. The two actors made the characters very believable and come to life just as one expected them. the pace was very gripping (pun intended!) and all of the supporting cast were excellent. Caution on the language and bits of nudity for those who may think of taking the young ones along for the experience. Enjoyed the whole movie, lots of witty dialog and the whole theater erupted in a standing ovation at the end. I guess that says it all.",8,2,3,23 September 2013
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," A peek at a slice of life of a famous Indian sports figure
","I went into this movie on the day it was released in North America, watched it on the big screen, with an open mind. Not since 'Lagaan' and 'Chak De India', have we had a decent sports-oriented Indian movie, which evokes a great deal of joy, pride and satisfaction. Happily this movie does that job and remains true to the title (despite several folks thinking it was incomplete). We get to see how this sports icon of India, grows up as a child in a province which discourages sports as means of making a living, the numerous struggles to gain acceptance, the subtle behind the scenes machinations, political maneuvers, highs and lows, extreme disappointment and despair, the almost drowning like sensation of feeling trapped as a misfit in the stagnant existence and finally summing up the courage to break free.I also loved the touch of non-cricket/non-sports related history of the main characters, no spoilers here, but the director has done a decent job of capturing the emotional hits taken along the journey of life. Very stoic responses to many of the roller coasters, several of the folks you meet along the way dispensing philosophical metaphors. The women cast in the movie did a very good job, played their roles and made it very believable. The support of the true childhood friends, the small town sights, sounds and smells was well done. If there is a slight flaw it was the use of computer graphic/video imagery where they superimpose the actor's face on the real video clips, came across as very amateurish or were too obvious. The director was able to coax out of all the cast the characteristic trait of deference and demeanor one sees in that part of the world, gave it an authentic feel.A worth while watch for all Indian sports lovers and families as well.",7,1,2,1 October 2016
