The Hangover," Some obvious goofs but nonetheless, a funny watchable movie
","Not bad although definitely not Bradley Cooper's best. I would say he did better in All About Steve, truthfully. Anyway, it was a bit boring in the beginning of the movie and things just get better from the trip to Vegas. Maybe it is just me, not getting those jokes spilling in but I still think that this movie doesn't have the oomph I am looking for. And some of it doesn't make sense like the fact that Doug stayed in the roof for two or is it three days without coming back down to ask for help or look for Phil, Stu and Alan. I mean, it is not like he's naked or something. So, why stayed there for no reason? And about the Chow, he is a good actor oh yeah. I am surprised that Stu and Phil don't have the senses to check whether it is really the Doug they are looking for before handing over the money. Plus, Jade doesn't look like a stripper at all. They should find someone who looks like one.",8,0,0,29 December 2009
Coraline," A Little More Humor Will Earn It A 10
","A pretty impressive animation movie. The 3D effect was used effectively, just like A Christmas Carol. However, if there is more humor, it would have earn a 10 from me. The only moment I did smile was when Coraline threw the cat to the Other Mother. I find the Other Dad as well as the Real Dad a little annoying. His face was so long, it could have touch the floor and the eye bags! Oh, and the fact that the REAL parents were scribbling 'Help Us' on the mirror and later forgot about they, being trapped make the whole scene looked so fake. I mean, how can they not know that they were trapped in a place so cold and snow was falling off their clothes and they didn't realize that? I am pretty sure there will be a Coraline 2 as I can see the story hanging there. Perhaps the Other Mother manages to open the little door and began to haunt the city, so Coraline defends the entire city with Wyborne and a few more characters, perhaps. Can't wait for the next one and hopefully the crew can add in more action and suspense.",9,1,4,25 December 2009
