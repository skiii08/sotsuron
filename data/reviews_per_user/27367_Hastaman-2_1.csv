The Rock," Top Notch Action
","Terrific.  This has got to be my favorite action movie of all time. Director Michael Bay has out-done himself, and it shows.  From beginning to end, the movie is filled with non-stop entertainment.  This is definitely Cage's most likeable role (his new stuff is just crap), and Harris/Connery both do wonderful jobs playing their parts.  Although far fetched, the plot is easy to understand and makes for lots of action.  The car chase and end scene (shootout/bombing) are two memorable scenes in my opinion and alone make the movie worth watching more than once.  But the best part about this movie has got to be the MUSIC!!!!!  This movie's score is the best action score to date.  Although I expected alot coming from 3 very talented composers, I was overwhelmed.  We get more then 10 excellent cues (not joking!) and they all fit their scenes perfectly.  Anyways, if you have not seen this movie, go do so!  You will not be disappointed. 10/10P.S. - What's with Cage and Marcil having sex with their underwear on?",10,1,1,26 July 1999
