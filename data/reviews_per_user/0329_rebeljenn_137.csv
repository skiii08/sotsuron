Vertigo," psychological thriller, excellent performances
","'Vertigo' is an engaging film about a detective who has a fear of heights and is led to follow a woman whose husband fears is possessed. While spying on the woman, the main character falls in love with her and saves her life. He vows to protect her, but his fear of heights prevents him from doing all that he can do. The film is a psychological thriller with some humour and romance. The scenes are beautiful and meaningful with pacing that adds to the story and adds to the psychology of the characters. The attention to detail is just as good in this film as it is in the other Hitchcock films. The acting is also done well with believable performances given by all. The female lead puts on a remarkable performance playing the possessed woman.The only complaint I have about this film is the ending, from the disaster until the end of the film. The theory behind what I think the director was trying to convey (fantasy) is imaginative, but the ending literally left me hanging without much of a resolution. It does not spoil the film, but this was somewhat of a let-down to me.",7,1,2,2 May 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny if you like this sort of humor
","'Borat' is a film about a man who travels to America and who ends up in all sorts of odd situations, fueled to travel to California to find and marry Pamela Anderson. Along the way, he ridicules America (without meaning to) and the American people, irregardless of ethnicity or religion. Some of the situations he finds himself in include singing the anthem (badly) at a rodeo, attending a meeting with feminists, learning (or trying to learn) etiquette at a dinner party, and trying to be cool with a group of black youths and wanting to be like them.The film is low-budget, and if you dislike 'offensive' humor or do not have the same sense of humor, then you will not enjoy this film. A lot of the humor is what I would consider very American, but there's also a lot of humor that some sensitive people may find offensive. (However, the film does not just pick on one group of people, but it makes fun of everyone, and it should be taken light-heartedly.) I found the film very funny. It's not a great film, but it serves its purpose in making me laugh. I wouldn't want to sit through another viewing, however, as I would know what happens and I don't think this humor would hold through a second viewing. (Some of the humor is 'shock value'.) Good for a comedy, but I wouldn't call it a classic.",6,1,7,11 November 2006
Gremlins," despite its faults, it is still enjoyable
","I remember that Gremlins took the country by storm back in the 1980s, but I was not allowed to watch it until I was much older. When I did get to watch it in my teens, I did enjoy the film. In fact, I enjoyed it more then than I do now after re-watching it. I think it was able to captivate an audience of the 1980s in the same way that E.T. did, but in today's world of CGI and a higher level of action, it falls short. Either that, or you have to be young to really enjoy this film. (I've just had to re-rate it a point lower than I had previously rated it.) 'Gremlins' is a cute film, and it's still funny and enjoyable to watch. The main problem with the film is the acting. The characters were a little boring, despite some of their quirks. I guess Gizmo and the Gremlins are meant to take the spotlight anyway, but whenever the main male or female characters come on the screen, there is an unhealthy dishing of dialogue. The love story is a little silly, but I do think it is done well. However, the serious dialog is often ridiculed as funny -- in part, it's down to some bad acting. The horrible story about the female lead's father is an example of this. It's a horrible story, but the manner in which it is told is almost amusing. It's difficult to take that seriously.Okay, I'll stop criticizing it now. It's a pretty good film, and it is a film that I enjoyed much more when I was younger.",7,3,8,20 December 2005
Antz," a good idea but overall failure
","Antz and A Bug's Life were both released in the same year, and both films competed with each other for an audience. Despite both films feature bugs as the heroes and the villains, the films are too different to really be compared. A Bug's Life is my personal favourite of the two, but it's not by much. It is simply a little more engaging. However, Antz uses a clever concept and focuses more on the world of the ant. The film can be enjoyed by adults and children, and like A Bug's Life, it is educational and entertaining.Antz is a story of individualism, which is an unusual concept in the world of ants. In fact, it is a little bit like communism. Everyone works, but nothing brings out the individual. For the most part, all ants look and act the same... but our little ant clearly stands out. It is he who saves the day because of his individuality and his ability to think.Although there are some good ideas and good story-telling behind this film, overall, it fails to really see it through and make a big impact. A Bug's Life was more entertaining and quickly paced, and it doesn't possess the sappy love story like Antz does. A Bug's Life also succeeds a little more with the family, whereas a lot of the story in Antz is just dull. I would recommend this film to children, but I would not bother recommending it to adults.",4,2,5,10 October 2005
Mission: Impossible III," gripping, what you can expect
","'Mission Impossible 3' is an action film about a detective for secret missions who plans to get married and settled down, but his friends/colleagues encourage him to not give up his job. This leads him to tracking down a criminal who plans to steal and sell something called 'the rabbit's foot'. This leads the main character into a mission where he must save his wife, who has been kidnapped by the criminal mastermind, and save the world from the 'rabbit's foot' at the same time. The film grips the audience on the edge of the seats in some of the fast-paced action sequences. I was impressed, but that may be because I was not expecting much of a film. The film has plenty of action and different types of action to keep up the interest while producing a semi-decent storyline. It's not supposed to be a classic, but it is entertaining. The biggest problem that I had with the film is the romance/love story. It was (and the dialogue was) very silly and often predictable. I just wanted to fast-forward through those heart-wrenching and sickening moments and enjoy the action.",6,0,1,7 May 2006
50 First Dates," Only offers short term fun
","As I am not a fan of Adam Sandler and his type of humor, this film is no exception to the rule. Sandler plays a young man in Hawaii who is afraid of commitment until he meets a young girl who suffers from short term memory loss after an accident. Finally, Sandler's character commits to help this girl, and he falls in love. This is pretty much the same mold that his other films portray. If you enjoyed Sandler's sense of humor and other films, then you will probably enjoy this one too. The comedy can be funny in some places, but it is crude in others, but only expect to remember the jokes in the short term (no pun intended!). The humor, however, is not quite as crude as some of his previous films. As I am not a fan of Adam Sandler and this type of comedy, I have to rate this one a 2/10.",2,7,18,19 March 2006
Catch Me If You Can," An excellent film
","'Catch Me If You Can' is a rare breed of film combining skill, history, adventure, and interesting characters. (And I don't give out 10-star ratings unless I personally love the film and think it could not have been done any better.) 'Catch Me if You Can' was similar to the 1950s and 1960s North By Northwest or Bond-style films. The acting is done very well, which is highly crucial to the film because it is a film about characters. Leonardo does an excellent job in a not-so-Leonardo-typical-role. A good job on this film in this type of role probably earned him the part of Huges in 'The Aviator.' It is easy to get caught up in this film because of the good characterization and the wittiness of the events which lead him to jump around from place to place, creating this fantasy world and getting caught up in all of the lies. It is easy to feel sorry for him as much as to wish that he were caught and cured of his criminal past.I would highly recommend this film because I think that there is something in it that will appeal to everyone. You may not appreciate it or enjoy it as much as I did, but I still think it is one of those films you will remember for years to come. Excellent. 10/10.",10,1,3,6 November 2005
Ghost," Good but not the best film of all time
","'Ghost' is a good film, but it is not the greatest film of all time. In its day, it was a huge success to the point where it was much over-rated.In short, the film is about a woman (Demi Moore) who comes to terms with her lover's death, and he returns as a ghost while she still clings on and lives a pretty sad existence for a while while her deceased lover is determined to save her from a similar doom. (It's highly emotional in places. One of the best and most quoted scenes is the scene where Demi's character is creating and molding a clay pot.) Coupled with excellent cinematography and pacing and actors/actresses, this film is worth a watch because it succeeds in conveying its emotion from the screen to our hearts. Expect to be emotionally moved, but don't expect the best film of all time. Enjoy it.",4,3,10,25 November 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Plenty of action will keep you on the edge of your seat
","'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Last Crusade' are equally excellent adventure/action films. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' sees Indiana Jones teaming up with a girl to find the lost ark and to keep it from the hands of the Nazis. I admire this film for its action and the sense of adventure and exploration, and I admire it over 'Last Crusade' for a more focused plot and quirkier characters. It's less spiritual than 'Last Crusade', and Indiana is not as personified as a man with a lot of story. (His father in 'Last Crusade' brings out the background story and another side to Indiana than we see in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.') They are both equally good films which offer plenty of action, and I have never heard anyone say that they do not like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' Completely recommended.",8,0,0,31 December 2005
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A remarkable film
","'E.T.' is one of those rare films that has the ability to captivate a family audience across all ages. It's one of the most memorable films of all time, showing the bond of friendship between an alien boy who wants to return home and a human boy and his family. It is a film that will make you laugh and cry and a film that will make your heart race with action scenes involving Elliott and a bicycle race to save E.T. and fly over the moon on a bicycle to safety. Undoubetly, this is one of the best films for all ages that was ever made.The 20th anniversary of the film isn't different at all to the 1982 released version. There are a couple of scenes of E.T. at the house that have been put back in the film, but these are only small segments, and they do not alter the film in any way whatsoever. The film is still cute, aging only a little. It's still a classic.",8,0,1,14 November 2005
Casablanca," A good film, but not the best.
","'Casablanca' is considered by some to be one of the best films ever made. I personally do not agree that it is the best film ever made. It is certainly a classic with the memorable lines and the dramatic ending and the relationship between the characters, plus good 'photography' and shot composition. Certainly, the soundtrack is brilliant, and it probably is among the top films in soundtrack alone.As a story and a film overall, my personal opinion is that this film is over-rated. Perhaps in the time it was made, it was among the best films. I think the majority of people would find the film tedious to sit through nowadays. (So, if you're in for a lot of action, you probably will not like the film at all. However, if you're looking for a good story about times past or just want to see what all of the hype is about, I don't think you'll be too disappointed. Hey, you may even think it is the best film ever made.)",5,6,14,20 October 2005
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," A classic dog tale
","One Hundred and One Dalmatians is another one of Disney's great cartoon dog stories, complete with an evil villain. Although it is a cute story, I felt that a lot of the middle of the film went a little bit slow and took away from the plot, hence my average rating. However, it's still a classic! Children and dog fanciers will enjoy this film, but it is probably one of those that the average adult would maintain an interest in, unlike Disney's other dog tale, Lady and the Tramp. However, despite the slowness of the plot and the dullness of some of the characters, I would recommend this to children and dog fanciers...and for those of us who share a nostalgic value from watching this film during one of its re-releases when younger.",5,2,12,23 October 2005
Monty Python's Life of Brian," It's funny, but it's not for everyone
","'Life of Brian' is Monty Python's film about Brian, a man in the old days who gets mistaken for being Jesus Christ. This film endures the humor that is typical of Monty Python. Fans of this type of dark and crazy humor and Monty Python will no-doubt love this film. It's not a masterpiece of film-making, but it has plenty of comedy at the expense of the Romans and Brian and other unfortunate souls. If you do not like Monty Python, you will not like this. In my opinion, Monty Python is alright, but it is not the funniest film out there, and it's not the sense of humor that is my favourite (if that makes sense). There's also some pretty good morals to be learned from watching this film. You'll laugh at the character names and even at the memorable song at the end. Enjoy it, but the film is not for everyone.",5,11,34,16 January 2006
Meet the Parents," Meet the Parents: extremely funny
","'Meet the Parents' is a brilliant take on a young man who goes to visit his girlfriend's parents for the first time. He is wanting to make an impression, but they just do not accept him and even make things difficult for him. They are strange themselves - the overbearing secret agent father, the druggie brother, the cat that can flush the toilet, and so on. The intentions of the young man are good, but he keeps getting himself into messes and more messes by attempting to do the right thing. This film is funny on many different levels, and I think that it can appeal to a wide audience because of the different types of humour shown. I do not care much for romantic comedy films, but this one had me laughing. Also, I would not bother with the sequel 'Meet the Fockers' at all because it is a totally different film and not at all consistent with the humour and feel of this film. Now, go watch 'Meet the Parents'!",8,1,1,22 January 2006
As Good as It Gets," as good as it gets... well, almost
","'As Good As It Gets' is a romantic comedy film about the circumstances that bring together three unlikely people: a man with obsessive-compulsive disorder, a mother, and a homosexual. Each of the characters have their flaws, and they learn to work together and work out their criticisms. That is the basic summary of the film, although that does not do it any justice because a lot of what there is to enjoy about this film is in the comedy and the characters. This is a funny film, but it is also emotional and touching. Comedy and good characters make this film and they save it from being total rubbish. Good, but it's not great. It's almost as good as it gets.5/10",5,0,5,9 November 2005
Citizen Kane," Symbolic in its own right
","There are so many people out there who love Citizen Kane and who have written some great reviews about it, having studied the film in much more detail. If you're one of those types of people or you're looking for that type of review, then I would consider you stop reading now. This mini-review is just written from the perspective of someone who enjoys watching films.Sadly, the average cinema viewer is not going to enjoy or appreciate this film. By today's standards, it is over-rated. This goes for my standards too. Yes, the film has been produced very well, and the photography is excellent. It is even a sad film; the ending is particularly sad, even when we do learn the source of Kane's dying word...with the knowledge that no one will probably ever know. Rightfully so, this film was considered a great film. It's still a good film, albeit over-rated in my eyes.I would watch this film again, but I would not recommend this film to the average audience. I think they would find it slow-moving and unimportant by today's standards...especially when the film has been hyped up as much as it is.",5,3,17,6 November 2005
Memento," Unfolding, complex, probably the best film of 2000
","'Memento' is a story about a man who suffers from memory loss. He vows revenge on his wife's murder, and he goes about to solve the crime through partial memories and notes that he leaves for himself to help him remember the details of his wife's murder and to track down the murderer. The story-telling and the story itself is amazing; it keeps unfolding like Russian dolls. The film is filled with complex characters, and it is easy to get disillusioned and out-of-focus, much like the main character. That said, it is done well and intentionally and it is an easy film to follow, and it has a complex storyline. I think that Memento was one of the best films of 2000. Interesting, unfolding, and complex, it does not give itself away lightly but calls on you to assess your own judgements.",7,0,2,26 January 2006
The 13th Warrior," silly battle scenes
","'The 13th Warrior' is an action/adventure film about a group of Viking warriors. Although there were some good ideas, I felt that they failed to come to life in this film. The characters could have been more interesting than they were, and they feel distant. The story really fails to engage because of the characters and the overall methods in which the story is told. However, the battle scenes were done well, except some of the events taking place turned out to be funny rather than serious. (The sound effects and some of the scenes of heads getting slashed, people doing miraculous killing moves against the odds, horses leaping in the nick of time to safety, over-acting character emotions, and showing a lot of gore for the sake of gore were silly.) This film can be enjoyed and laughed at both if you're not looking for much of a story.",4,2,3,26 March 2006
Shaun of the Dead," At least a dozen laughs
","Shaun of the Dead has its moments. If you have ever seen the television series Spaced, there are several parodies between the series and this film. (Of course, as the title suggests, it parodies the old zombie horror films.) It's worth a trip to the cinema to see it for the sake of seeing it, and it has a dozen laughs or so. However, I feel that the film loses the appeal toward the last 40 minutes of the film. This is when it turns more horror and less comedy; it seems as though they wanted to wrap it up quickly all at once. I recommend it for the social/society jokes and parody humor that made the series Spaced brilliant. If you are in need of a laugh, I would recommend this film for its light humor. I rate it 5/10.",5,2,5,15 April 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," average action film
","'Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest' is a continuation of the first film that became a popular hit with audiences. This adventure carries on from the original one, but this time, Jack Sparrow (Depp) is back and trying to escape Davy Jones and his crew from death. Like the original, the film combines comedy and some good performances along with a creative set and special effects. It's an average action film and the perfect way to spend an evening. However, the film seemed to be a little too long, and the other problem with it was that it did not have a proper ending. I was getting built up to a good ending, but it just did not come. I suppose we have to wait a year or two for the next film to see the outcome. Overall, there were some good action sequences and good comedy, but the film needed a proper ending.",5,1,3,13 July 2006
Rocky V," the worst Rocky
","'Rocky V' is the final chapter in the Rocky universe. This time, Rocky is set to train his son his secrets on boxing so that his son is able to defend himself. Rocky goes from being an absent father to one who plays an important part of his son's life, much to the unhappiness of his wife, and this draws a rift in the family. This is certainly the one 'Rocky' story to miss. The story is dull, and it is not as engaging as the others. It is mainly a soap opera between Rocky and his family, and the son is the star of the film; it is a film about him and not so much about Rocky. I would give this one a miss. Poor story, poor acting, poor film.",1,9,17,20 March 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Offers fun times but little else
","'Pirates of the Caribbean' is an old-fashioned adventure pirate film, combining new animation techniques with humor, romance, and pirate battles. The film is not a great film by any means; it is simply fun. The film moved a little slow in some places, and I was not impressed by Johnny Depp's performance at all. The film really had little to offer in terms of an original story, but if you are looking for a film that is fun and something to liven up a dull evening, this film is okay. Children and adults can both enjoy this. It's not great, but it can probably be enjoyed by a wide audience. I give this a 4/10 because I did not think it was anything special.",4,3,5,5 March 2006
Beauty and the Beast," stunning animation
","The best thing about Beauty and the Beast is the stunning animation, particularly the ballroom scene. This scene really makes you feel like you are there; the movement is superb. Disney again takes an enjoyable and popular tale and weaves it into a magical film. Unfortunately, this is one of the last Disney films that has charm, particularly the charm of some of the old Disney films. It's enjoying to watch, and the characters are not annoying in the slightest, unlike some of Disney's other films. This film is worth a watch and should be enjoyed by the whole family. Captivating, romantic, and packed with action and good lessons - this is definitely a family film (though maybe with a slight preference to females).",6,2,13,13 November 2005
The English Patient," grossly over-rated
","Remember that episode of 'Seinfeld' where the characters decide to see 'The English Patient' and everyone thinks it is the best film ever made except for Elaine, and they cannot believe that she did not like it. (If you have not seen 'Seinfeld', I think you get the idea anyway.) This is what it was like when the film came out. When I eventually got around to seeing it, I thought it was one of the most over-rated films of all time. First of all, it was too long to sit through a story that just did not engage me. The photography was the only thing that I thought was done well. My review of this film is that it was not a terribly good film, but it was considered a great film when it was released.",4,13,29,16 November 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Falls short of a better film, but good
","A decent film, 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' is at times captivating, but, it falls short of delivering a better film. I haven't read the book since I was about 10, and I saw the cartoon on television -which I really enjoyed- before that. However, this review is not to look at the film adaption of the book and to say what was done wrong and what was removed; it's been too long ago for me to really remember the story to go into that detail! I am rating this as a film. Design, pacing, and acting and the three main areas that I'll cover in this review; each had varying levels of success. Although some of the film design was done very well, I did have some problem with some of the CGI and realism. Some of the design was done exceptionally well, and some of it wasn't. For example, the scenes of the children crossing the river, the lion, and the creatures turning to (or from) stone were quite well done, but I had some problems with the CGI beavers and some of the other critters. The beavers did not look realistic, but it looked as if they were made to be realistic without facial expressions (or limited expressions). The lion was done well, and CGI in other films is also done well, but it seemed to me as if the beaver got the short end of the stick (no pun intended) when it came to CGI. The battle scenes also involved some less-than stunning CGI compared to what I've seen in other films. Costume design and set design was generally very good from the castle to the beaver's home. There were some very good shots; in particular, the shot of the curtain falling down from the wardrobe while Lucy pulls on it is very good. The film did have some trouble with brining the camera into the scene; it seemed difficult to really get involved in the film in some places because the characters seemed distant while better camera use could have brought the audience more into the story instead of making them feel like outsiders. Pacing was another unfortunate drawback of the film. There was often a sense that some events were slow while the action scenes got less time. Not related to pacing, but I did notice consistency issues. Lucy provides one of the characters with a hankerhief, which is later retrived from another character and then by the same character at the end of the film. In principle, the character who presented this at the end should not have had the item anymore. Acting was done well throughout except for a couple of instances involving CGI, including the character who becomes alive again after being turned to stone. Overall, it's a good film for children, and it reminded me of Disney's older children's films. It also reminded me of Lemony Snicket -- I guess it goes to show that children enjoy films where children are in unfortunate circumstances and become the heroes. I hope more films like this continue to get made. It's certainly not a perfect film, but it is not too bad. I give it a 6/10.",6,1,4,10 December 2005
Happy Gilmore," Sandler fans will enjoy it, but gets old fast
","'Happy Gilmore' stars Adam Sandler as a want-to-be hockey player who discovers that he is actually a born golfer. He decides to join a golfing tournament in order to save his grandmother's house. Humor and golfing antics follow in his quest.Adam Sandler plays similar characters in his films, and this one is no exception. While some of the comical events are funny, Sandler and that sense of humor just fails to do it for me. If you are a fan of Sandler and enjoy his films, then you will probably like this one. If you don't like him, then don't bother. Yes, there are a few bits that are funny, but it gets old quickly and it is certainly not the type of film you will watch over and over again because once you have seen the jokes and know what is going to happen, the appeal has worn off.",3,2,7,29 December 2005
Elizabeth," great performances, picture
","'Elizabeth' is a historical documentary film about Queen Elizabeth I's early years on the throne. This is a story of the queen coping with relationships among a lover, the religious groups, and countries (France and Spain). This film combines excellent acting performances, cinematography, and an interesting story that can appeal to a wide audience.The acting performances were done well throughout the film, and this was especially an important aspect because this is a film about people. Blanchett played an excellent queen, humanising her in her relationships and weaknesses as well as creating a strong-willed and determined leader at the same time.The cinematography also played an important part in this historical film; much care is given to detail. Although most of the film takes part in the palace, colour is used to provide a sense of the times in flashy costumes and events. The contrast helps to portray the historical significance of the film in that throughout the dark times, the Elizabethans loved their entertainment.The story was focused primarily on Elizabeth and her relationships, and it kept the focus on these aspects and did not get too detailed in the overall picture. The story was interesting with a variety of different scenes, and it did not get too involved with fancy dialogue. There was also a sense of humor in the film through the foreign suitor character who was flashy in his emotions and who enjoyed dressing up in a dress. This showed that although the film was a historical one, it was able to find some humor with the characters that is believable and that did not spoil the serious essence of the film.Overall, this is a great film and I'd recommend it. Students in history classes must watch this film but realise that it is only a small aspect of Elizabeth I's life. However, it is a good documentary of the queen and the general historical time.",7,1,2,28 May 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," enjoyable and witty but poor story
","'Ice Age 2: The Meltdown' makes a good sequel, although no surprise that it is not as good as the original. The same characters are back, including the squirrel, and some new characters are introduced in the form of a comedic opposum duo and a naive wooly mammoth that thinks she is an opposum. The animals band together to escape from being drowned from the melting ice, and in this film, the enemies are less apparent: vultures waiting for them to die and two shark-like creatures that live in the water.This film does have several hilarious moments and one-liners. However, the story is very weak. The film also goes quite slowly in some places but does not leave enough time for others. For example, after the small group of characters is first confronted with the under-water creature, they appear to be stuck in the lake of melted water without a way to get across because of the disturbances caused by the enemy. After this action, it cut directly to another scene. In general, there were a few areas that could have been cut or edited more because they moved quite slowly, and they did not add that much to the story. There was also a general good balance between the comedy and the story. The opposum duo could have been really annoying if they had done much more with them. That said, the characterization was done as well as it was in the first film.The animation had improved from the first film. I was amazed that the fur looked like fur, and the fur actually looked wet. The underwater scenes looked believable as well as the water. The burst of water from the ice dam looked pretty good as well, and I am sure that it took a long time to get that to look right.The lack of a good story brings this film down a bit, but the comedy makes up for it. It's still a film that children will enjoy, although it does not hold the same charm as the first film and is less memorable. I give it about an average score because it did make me laugh, it was enjoyable, and the animation was good, but it lacked a good story.",4,13,26,1 April 2006
Billy Elliot," Over-rated
","Although it has its moments and is an inspiring film with excellent performances, Billy Elliott fails to captivate and convince. Although the performances were convincing, it was difficult to relate to the characters. Overall, Billy Elliott is grossly over-rated and emotional, but it does carry a good message that people should use their talents and do what makes them happy in self-fulfillment...even if they risk being ridiculed because what they enjoy is not mainstream or conventional. At best, it's average. It's got a very good message, but it just failed to really go that extra bit to be a really great film. 3/10.",3,3,14,13 November 2005
Finding Nemo," Cute but annoying
","'Finding Nemo' is a touching little story about a cute little clownfish who gets separated from his father. The father sets out on a journey to find Nemo, the lost little clownfish, and he meets several new friends along the way, including a blue fish with memory problems named Dori and a group of Australian turtles.The story is a cute one with a wide range of characters that will appeal to children and events that are frightening and challenging that the father must go through in order to find his son. It's a typical children's cartoon, really, using the ideas of other stories before it.The animation is done well - particularly under the water, which is difficult to animate. However, the pacing of the film gets a little bit slow in some places. While the father is searching for Nemo, the events seem to go on and on. Also, I found Dori to be very trying and annoying. The jokes about her and memory loss went on far too long, and I just found this to be too annoying. Children may like that, but it made the film less enjoyable for me.Overall, I would rate this as an average film - particularly over other children's films. I cannot fault the animation, though.",4,1,3,24 November 2005
Hot Fuzz," Very entertaining, action-packed, funny
","'Hot Fuzz' is a satirical story about a police officer from London who is moved to a quiet village. Along the way, he tries to uncover the truths about some abnormal deaths in the village. The film pokes fun at small British village life in Gloucestershire, the police, and at itself. Simon Pegg (and some of his Spaced co-stars) makes his come-back with this satirical, dark-humored film. There's plenty of action and humour and school-child events (like creative ways in which people meet their ends). This film appeals to the inner child, so it cannot be taken seriously, and the action/suspense/comedy keep it interesting. In my opinion, 'Hot Fuzz' is a better film than 'Sean of the Dead'. The pitfalls of 'Sean of the Dead' (which was not too bad of a film) were overcome in 'Hot Fuzz' to create a more entertaining film.",9,1,5,21 February 2007
Dead Poets Society," a feel-good film
","'Dead Poet's Society' is a film about a professor who teaches poetry to a classroom full of boys so that poetry can be respected and appreciated. It's a film that has gained a pretty good following over the years. I've known this film to change the lives of some people a little bit and to appreciate life more. In short, it is one of the feel-good films with a good moral.A comparable film (in some ways) is 'Mona Lisa Smile' which features a professor at an all-girl's school who teaches art history. Then, there was that film who had a professor of English teach military students how to appreciate literature and Hamlet. Each of these films shows how the students grow and begin to appreciate learning.Well done. I wouldn't call this the greatest film, but it's a job well done.",5,1,4,13 November 2005
Ed Wood," simply good
","'Ed Wood' is a film that is considered a good film for several reasons, and it is a film that I imagine most people would like if they would just give it a chance. But, don't let that spoil it or hype it up. You really have to watch the film to believe it yourself.'Ed Wood' is a semi-documentary film about a film director who produced some films that were considered pretty dreadful. This film introduces us to Ed Wood and his many friends, most of them actors and people in the movie business, and his love of dressing up in women's clothing. (This film's humor is often tongue-in-cheek and even witty in places, but it's also sad - and certainly not a comedy.) If you're bored of the typical current movie and want a little something to make you chuckle and think a little bit, then I suggest you watch 'Ed Wood'.",7,3,4,15 November 2005
Chicken Run," very enjoyable
","Chicken Run is a comical, 'The Great Escape'-like film featuring claymation chickens. The chickens need to escape their prison-like hen-house. They are led by an American rooster called Rocky and a hen with an English accent named Ginger.Chicken Run is packed with action, comedy, and likable characters. It is a film for all ages. Adults can also enjoy the other film references to 'The Great Escape', 'Braveheart', and others. The animation is also very good, and it's much better than what computers can do. (I suppose that it's so easy to complicate computer animation while this claymation technique is kept simple, not over-worked, and has a more aesthetic and not-so-perfect appeal.) Technique aside, Chicken Run is a very clever and witty film.This is a highly recommended film for any age or gender. Sit back and enjoy the humor and imaginative story that unfolds in claymation form.",7,0,0,22 October 2005
Home Alone," hilarious Christmas movie
","'Home Alone' is a Christmas treat, which will make you feel all warm and glowing inside by the end of the film and have you laughing hysterically throughout the (almost) 2 hours. Kevin (played by Culkin) is one of the youngest boys in a large family that live in a large house in the suburbs. While the family go away for the holidays, Kevin accidentally gets left behind, and he becomes the hero of the film by protecting his house against a couple of idiotic bandits. The film is filled with slapstick humour which will leave you laughing hysterically. There's also some subplots which will leave you nice and warm for the holidays. Generally, it is a excellent feel-good film made just for the holidays for everyone in the family. In my opinion, it is one of the best Christmas films, and I think that nearly everyone of any age will appreciate this film.",9,0,1,30 December 2005
The Jungle Book," Doesn't have much going for it except the music
","'The Jungle Book' is a Disney animated film about a boy who was raised by wild animals, and this film is basically a musical representation of his time with these animals and to celebrate his growing up, into an adult and to leave the wonderful animal world behind. Later, Baloo the bear and some of the other characters of this film would go on to be a part of a cartoon series 'Tale Spin' on the Disney channel. Regrettably, I did not enjoy this Disney animation. The only thing that it had going for it was the music. It's an easily-forgotten Disney animation, and I would not particularly recommend this film. Try 'Bambi' or 'Lady and the Tramp'.",4,3,16,31 December 2005
Sleepy Hollow," average
","'Sleepy Hollow' is a film based on the Halloween story of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman. The film uses brilliant cinematography that captures the essence of evil and grips the imagination with ghostly characters and a rural 1800s village setting.The film combines a murder mystery with supernatural events from beyond the grave and a romance story in the middle of the supernatural happenings. The performances are done well, and this film has everything if you are looking for a little bit of historical fiction with a light-hearted supernatural tale. This film also succeeds in containing a little bit for everyone: romance and action/adventure.The main problem with the film is that it moves a little bit slowly in some places. It's not a bad film, but it did not stand out as a great film. Average.",5,1,3,30 August 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Love da bomb!
","'Doctor Strangelove' is considered one of Kubrick's best films, and it's been referenced in many other documentaries and films. The best thing about this film is its dark humor. The film centers around politicians in the eve of a nuclear holocaust. The comments by some of the characters about nuclear war is crazy -- it's so insane and stupid that you cannot help but to laugh at some of the comments (ie: 'precious bodily fluids'). Even watching the cowboy riding on top of the nuclear warhead as it plummets to the Earth is hilarious, in a dark and disturbing way.Some people probably won't 'get' this humor or understand it. As a film, it really is not that great. It's a pretty good and different view of nuclear war, which was controversial (hence its popularity), but it isn't a great film. It's just different.",4,4,14,14 November 2005
The Beach," Paradise lost
","While attempting to be a dark and thoughtful film, The Beach simply struggles to find a voice and to be taken seriously. There are some good ideas about disasters in paradise (or paradise at a cost), but these ideas have similarly been done before. The film makes an effort, but it struggles to capture the characters and overall meaning. The only good thing about the film is the cinematography. If they had put more emphasis on the characters and used the cinematography to capture the characters' feelings more appropriately, then this would have been worth watching. Instead, it just loses itself in paradise and in the pretty cheesy events.",4,2,5,13 November 2005
Scary Movie 2," another one for the discounted DVD racks
","'Scary Movie 2' is the sequel to the comedy horror-film parody 'Scary Movie'. The teenagers are back with more crude humor and situations, and this time, they are staying over at a haunted house where they meet some more unusual characters and parodies from other horror films. As in the first film, there is no novelty or artistic merit here. If you are into this sort of crude humor and jokes (and sexual-referenced jokes), then this is the film for you. If you do not like teenage comedies or this humor, then do not bother. It is one of those films that you see in the discount racks in DVD stores - cheaply-priced with few sold.",1,1,2,2 April 2006
Elf," My 'inner elf' thought it would be worse than it was
","When I first saw the advertisements and previews for 'Elf', I thought that it looked like one of the dumbest films ever to be shown in cinemas. I thought: 'why would anyone want to see that stupid-looking film with that stupid-looking elf in pretty yellow tights and a green suit'? But, people saw it; some people I know saw it, and they said it was good, and I had to ask them if they were getting therapy. Well, anyway, I was wrong about the film. It has not been the first time, and it probably won't be the last. Whilst flying in the air, the airline showed this film, and I caught the later three-fourths (and watched the entire film shortly afterward). I *actually* thought that the film was funny - not just funny, but it was hilarious in some places. I can even still remember some of the events that made me laugh, but I won't post them here and spoil them, and some of them have to be seen to be appreciated.Now, this is not a great film, so don't expect it to be a flawless masterpiece. Just expect to get a couple hours of laughter and a semi-touching story about an innocent and naive elf misplaced in the city. I recommend that you see it this holiday season. It will make you laugh and put you in the Christmas spirit - er, elf.",6,4,7,15 November 2005
Lost in Translation," An average film
","When I came to see this film, I was under the impression that it would be a romantic comedy. So, I was not expecting much. Maybe that is why I give it an average rating. (The more I expect, the less impressed I seem to be).This film is not a romantic comedy. It has an element of romance in it, but I feel that it is more religious- a young girl who is trying to find her meaning in life. The comedy mainly comes from the differences of culture and the situations the characters find themselves in in Japan.Overall, I give it a 4 out of 10. Average",4,1,2,19 February 2004
Rocky II," Better story than the first
","'Rocky II' is the sequel to the successful 'Rocky' film, and in some ways, it is better. The story of 'Rocky II' was much better, for example. It is not as slow as the first one, and it is more powerful. The acting also improved along with the story, and the showdown between Apollo Creed and Rocky was shot very well. There is also the romantic and personal life moments for Rocky as his wife gives birth and as they struggle to make ends meet. The relationship between the two is strained, and the film captures this element well with the change in events and the focus on life, love, and training. Adrian is Rocky's strength in many ways. A better story than the original, this one should not be missed.",5,2,7,20 March 2006
Corpse Bride," Humor is not undead in Burton's new film
","'Corpse Bride' is an enjoying 77 minutes of an enjoyable romp through the world of the living and of the dead, full of a cast of endearing and not-so-endearing characters and occasional wit and humor. Although some of it is a little bit disturbing (dancing skeletons, a talking maggot, and the general theme of death), the film itself is light-hearted and witty. It's a generally pleasant little story with pleasant characters and events that have all gone wrong to bring them all together. (Right, so it is a little bit predictable in places, but it has enough to be thoroughly enjoyable.) I would recommend this film, and it is a good film to go and see at this time of year with the Halloween theme. Some people may find this film to be a little bit odd if they are unfamiliar with Tim Burton's films and style.",7,0,0,29 October 2005
Romeo + Juliet," forbidden love revisited
","'Romeo + Juliet' stars Leonardo DiCaprio in an early role as Romeo, before Titanic. This film is an updated version of Shakespeare's play. The good thing about this film is that it brings a classic play into an easy way for our generation to understand the basic theme and story behind it while being as true to the play as it can, giving it a modern face-lift and having it take place in Verona Beach, Florida instead of Italy. Despite using the classic scenario about a forbidden and romantic love in modern times, the original play still appealed to me more, and I also preferred the 1969 film based on the original story. Still, it's not bad, but it is not good either.",3,1,4,23 March 2006
Forrest Gump," good but over-rated
","While 'Forrest Gump' is a good movie, it is a victim of being an over-rated movie. It was one of those films that was in the public eye for a few years, and people quoted it until it became less than a novelty. Finally, it died down, and it is nearly forgotten by the fickle mainstream now.The film follows a southern United States boy with a below-average IQ into adulthood. It is a film about love and longing as much as it is a comedy film and a historical film. (I know that there are a few rated scenes, but this would be a good film to show to young adults because it is as entertaining as it is a lesson in American history.) Forrest happens to be involved in some important events from his childhood in the 1950s (where he meets and inspires Elvis) to the end of segregation, the Vietnam war, and meeting the president. Despite his low IQ, luck plays a big part in Forrest's life except in his love life where he yearns for Jenny, a girl he knew since his childhood.I would recommend this film, even though it is over-rated.",7,1,2,24 November 2005
Bridget Jones's Diary," I am Bridget Jones
","Bridget Jones' Diary is a romantic escape into the life of an imperfect singleton and the little events and habits in her life that we find amusing -- probably in part because we are each a little bit like Bridget and want to be accepted and loved. Who hasn't been embarrassed by their parents, unintentionally made a fool of oneself at a social gathering, wore the wrong clothing (or costume) to a party, dated the wrong person, or messed up at an interview? Bridget Jones' Diary is lovable and funny because it is believable and deals with these every-day events, though usually with a cruel or embarrassing twist at the expense of poor Bridget.Overall, Bridget Jones' Diary is an excellent example of a romantic comedy, and its popularity is gained through lovable and quirky characters that are easily sympathized with. Although the same lovable characters appear in the sequel, the humor is not nearly as imaginative and not focused around the everyday little events. Watch Bridget Jones' Diary is you're looking for a light and funny film. Don't bother with the sequel unless you're a major fan of the genre.",7,1,1,6 October 2005
Notting Hill," a bittersweet romance, powerful and emotional
","Those who look for a story about bittersweet romance need look no further than 'Notting Hill', starring the ever-handsome English Hugh Grant and American star, Julia Roberts. Hugh Grant's character is an ordinary man who lives and owns a travel bookstore in Notting Hill. He falls in love with celebrity actress (played by Julia Roberts) who happens to come into his store. She then leads him on a wild chase and ultimately breaks his heart while he is trying to win her over. But, like other films in this formula, there is a happy ending.'Notting Hill' is very British in style, and it has that sense of Hugh Grant-esquire humour. Then, there is his Welsh flatmate, the odd sister and odd dates, and the embarrassingly-funny and confessional press conference. It is easy to feel sorry for Hugh Grant's character, and this film does play on the tenderness. It also does not take itself too seriously by offering the humour, mainly at shy Grant's expense. There's also some fast-paced action at the end, and it is feel-good because it brings all of the characters together. Talk about team-work. I'm not a fan of this genre of film, but I did enjoy 'Notting Hill'.",6,3,5,20 February 2006
The Aviator," Excellent, the best of 2004
","The Aviator is my personal favourite film of 2004. I was amazed at the story-telling and the wide mix that made this film. It's a documentary, and it is blended with action, romance, psychology, history, and a great music track. The attention to detail and the picture is excellent. Scorsese does a fine job portraying the mood for every scene in a combination of images and audio. The characterisation is done as brilliantly as some of Scorsese's other films. If you are looking for an excellent storyline, characters, and cinematography, then you must see this film. It stands on its own very well - as a story and as a biography. (For those of you who think that this movie 'has got to be boring' because it is a historical biography, I am telling you that I did not find it boring at all.) You have got to see this film. It's great.",8,2,3,13 November 2005
The Italian Job," More of a different version instead of a remake
","'The Italian Job' (2003) is really not a remake of the 1969 film, as such. It's basically the same concept involving chase scenes with Mini Coopers, but this film has a lot more to it than that. It's completely modernized, and it involves the use of technology in the criminal mastermind as well as romance and revenge. The character story is more in-depth in this version, and the characters have a sense of reasoning for their actions. There is also a lot more action throughout the film in this version than there is in the 1969 version, and there is a different story and subplot and ending. I don't think the two versions can be compared, and I do not call this a remake.Although it contains a lot of action and good characterisation, I found that the action got old quickly. It's still a good film, but it felt too ordinary and unoriginal in some places. It just feels like a typical 1990s/2000s movie following the certain mold of character scenarios and stereotypes.The Mini Cooper chase scenes are done well, and I guess it helped Mini sell their cars in America, although I've always loved the Mini Cooper and now everyone else seems to. Anyway, this is a good action film and a good film to watch to liven up the day.",6,1,2,31 December 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Beautiful but too slow
","Overall, I enjoyed the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, but I found 'Fellowship of the Rings' to be too slowly-paced for my liking. Obviously, that cannot be helped much as the story itself (and it is very close to the novel) is slow. The film involves the characters beginning their journey to defeat the evil wizard and his army, who are planning to take over Middle Earth. The film has all the fantasy elements: wizards, dragons, dwarfs, elves, powerful landscapes, trolls, and much more. If you have trouble with fantasy films, this one is not for you because it does consist mainly of the characters trekking around for nearly three hours (this, among other story elements) in the wilderness. I haven't been able to bring myself to watch it again after seeing it in the cinema because it is such a long film and because I thought it was too dull and long. The best thing about this film is the photography; some of the scenes are spectacular, and there is no doubt that a lot of time was invested in the cinematography of this film and the attention to detail in costume. (I have been to the exhibition in the London Science Museum to see some of the props and how the films were made, and -to say the least- it was amazing.) I greatly prefer the other two films to this one, but I suppose you must see this one to understand the others.",5,2,4,18 January 2006
Grease," Teen rebellion and romance and music!
","'Grease' always seems to make its come-back in the world of theatre and television every few years or so. The film seems to come and go with popularity, but it is still considered one of the great musicals by some people, but I really did not think it was as great as some people make it out to be. It's just a simple teen rebellion love story. Olivia Newton-John falls in love with bad-boy Travolta. There is a little bit of denial and reluctance in the romance as Newton-John is a wholesome good girl. The music and the dance routines are pretty good, so it does make a good musical, but by the end of the film, Newton-John sports bad-girl image with big hair and clothing with an attitude. I couldn't help but to scream inside: 'Noo! You looked much better in good-girl image with nice straight hair, Olivia! Now you look horrible!' This film is all about rebellion as it is about the music.",5,6,15,1 December 2005
Cast Away," Mr. Wilson.... thumbs down
","Oh boy. Another Tom Hanks film.'Cast Away'... it received a lot of positive feedback when it came out, but it's suddenly been forgotten now. Even Mr. Wilson, the star of the film, couldn't bring the audience back and keep them. Mr. Wislon even put on better acting than Tom Hanks - nothing personal against the man, but there for a while, he was cast away in similar roles of the unsung hero type.'Cast Away' certainly isn't a great film. It was enjoyable to watch for a little while. It even did a decent job of observing a man stranded on a deserted island. It even had a fairly happy ending. If you're in for these types of romanticized films, you'll probably think this is a pretty decent movie. Personally, I wouldn't recommend it and say that anyone has to see this film.Mr. Wilson was the star. He needs to come out in a film all of his own.",4,1,5,20 October 2005
Armageddon," after seeing this movie, I wish it was the 'end'...
","Armageddon. There are several problems with this film. One of the areas that it lacks in is believability. (I cannot believe for a moment that NASA would hire oil drillers to destroy a comet heading for Earth.) This movie is too Hollywood for my liking. It is the typical thriller story about ultimate disaster and the average American having a chance at becoming a hero and finding romance or becoming a hero through self-sacrifice. This film was released in the same year as Deep Impact, but unlike Deep Impact (which focused more on characters), Armageddon was more scientific. I would not recommend this film unless you are a big fan of the typical Hollywood 'thriller' genre. Even then, to avoid disappointment, don't expect a great film.",3,1,3,9 November 2005
Pitch Black," simply bad
","'Pitch Black' is a science fiction thriller about a group of astronauts that find themselves stranded on a desserted planet with creatures that come out at dark and start killing off the astronauts one-by-one as they attempt to find a way off the planet. This film is a typical thriller, and if you enjoy this type of film, then you will probably enjoy this. In my opinion, the film was too slow-moving, and the action and attempt to create an emotional and frightening story just did not work. It had little to offer, and it was dull that the film took place in just one planet, in the darkness. It was also unrealistic in the sense that these creatures are living on the planet, but what do they feed on, besides the small group of stranded astronauts? Simply a bad film, but I don't like thrillers, so this may appeal to some.",1,4,7,5 March 2006
American Psycho," disturbing, slow-moving
","It has been a while since I saw the film 'American Psycho', but I remember that it did not impress me. The film is about an executive who fantacizes about having affairs with and killing women with blond hair. The killings are gruesome ones reminiscent of slasher films. I remember there to be far much more gore than there was an artistic psychological aspect. All in all, this film was fairly disturbing and it is not the sort of film that you can expect to enjoy. I probably would not recommend it when you're about ready to go to bed either. Also, it was fairly boring and slow-moving. It probably makes a better book than a film.",3,1,3,28 May 2006
Doctor Zhivago," Excellent cinematography and symbolism. Beautifully made.
","As a classic film, I was expecting a little more. I am not saying that 'Doctor Zhivago' is a horrible film because I do not think it is. The acting and the cinematography is absolutely brilliant. Even the music plays a very central part of the film, bringing back Dr Zhivago with his childhood. The film flirts around with revolution and war and affair, and this also works. But, the cinematography with the Russian landscape and the snowstorm is more moving than the story itself, which I feel fails to capture and engage. It is also hard to feel any emotion for the characters as we remain distant from them and watch the events taking place around them... even they know more of their direction than we do. (The wife of Zhivago knew about the affair.) In many ways, it seems like the film focuses more on Lara than it does on Zhivago. Lara steals the scene of any part she is in. The two seem to be made for one another, even though destiny keeps bringing them together and pulling them apart.Doctor Zhivago will not be enjoyed by everyone because it is a deep film, and it's also one that probably needs to be watched a few times before it is fully understood. A good knowledge of history is probably worthwhile too. Also, some may think the film moves along too slowly. It is a long film and I'll admit that it is a difficult one to sit through because it is not the most engaging film.The most memorable parts of the film are obviously the cinematography - the sweeping snowy landscapes while they travel on the train, the field of yellow daffodils, and the bright and colourful sunflower (Lara's flower) in the make-shift hospital building during the war. One scene ends with showing the empty room after the characters leave, and the vase with one sunflower sits on the table. A couple of petals fall off the sunflower and onto the table. For a couple of minutes, the camera is still, and we just watch this. Excellent symbolism, and this film is probably one of the best examples of cinematography ever.",5,5,11,13 November 2005
American Beauty," beautiful
","American Beauty portrays the suburban life of a man who looks back on his life and sees the problems within it. It is a story of him and the people who he interacts with, who eventually play a little part in his small life. The characterization is good and believable, thanks to some talented actors and actresses. It is also a very thoughtful film, examining beauty and perspective. (Different people have different ideas about beauty.) The film is full of twists and turns, and character development and emotion is one of the strongest points of this film. (A similar concept about people looking back on their lives is the popular Desperate Housewives series.) American Beauty is worth at least one watch. Several viewings are recommended because there are things you wouldn't have noticed or thought about deeply enough in one viewing.",6,0,1,23 October 2005
The Patriot," amusing dialogue and plays on emotion
","This film about the American War of Independence puts Mel Gibson in a familiar role, similar to the role he played in 'Braveheart'. In my opinion, the film did not take itself seriously with the unrealistic heroism and poor dialogue and its play on emotions. (Locking up a whole village in the church and setting fire to it is playing on emotions as is the death of the boy, which turns Mel Gibson's character into a hero seeking revenge and freedom from the English.) I thought that this film played too much on the indestructible hero, and the dialogue was often amusing instead of serious, although I think that it was trying to be serious. It was not the worst film that I have ever seen, and it was not a particular fun film to see. It was probably a waste of the ticket. Too bad, because I do enjoy historical films.",2,4,9,1 March 2006
Rocky IV," Not very good
","'Rocky IV' tries to keep the Rocky world alive by introducing yet another match and making sure that Rocky does not give up fighting. This time, Rocky vows revenge on a Russian champion who killed Apollo in a fight. Rocky feels the need for some revenge, so he frantically does everything that he can to make himself strong enough to defeat the Russian. He puts his life in danger, much to the upset of his wife. Again, this film revisits the strength that Rocky receives through his wife. The story is pretty tacky, and the film seems as if it is pushing a political message at the same time as telling a story. This film is really the downhill for Rocky, and I don't recommend it.",2,2,8,20 March 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," stale...
","The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a typical Hollywood comedy. There are a few laughs, but I found the majority of the film to be stale. Most of the characters are unlikeable, thinking only about sex and trying to set up their geeky friend with a few one-night stands. I didn't know whether or not this was Hollywood making fun of society, or whether it had some other meaning behind it. This movie struck so close to home and some of the comments and characters reminded me a little bit of reality. I'm not sure if there was a deeper meaning behind this film other than society and peer pressure put too much on sex, and if you haven't done it, then you're probably unattractive or a geek. However, my rating of this film isn't down to any meaning that may or may not be behind it - I felt that this film had little to offer except for a few cheap laughs, most of which are not even memorable a day after having seen it. And I must blame myself for a part of this rating because I don't particularly care for romantic comedies but thought I'd give it a try because it was rated well on here. (What are you guys thinking?! LOL!)",3,6,13,18 September 2005
Face_Off," violent and dull
","'Face/Off' is a film about a secret agent who has had his face swapped with another man's: a terrorist/criminal. Now, based on that information, you pretty much know what is going to happen in the film. The only thing that this movie has going for it is violence and an attempt to come up with a new idea. I will admit, the idea of swapping identies is kind of cool. However, this film does not get anymore original than that. It is all about the violence and people getting killed and things blowing up and major showdowns between characters. That's really all there is to it. If you're of the male gender, then you may go for this sort of film. If you prefer films that make you think, then I suggest looking elsewhere because there is little to be gained in this film.",1,15,31,17 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," the best so far
","'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' sees Harry becoming an older and more rebellious character, this time wanting to escape the escape prisoner Sirius Black. In this story, Potter learns even more about his parents and about himself. This story and film is much more darker than the previous two, and although there is too much to fit into the film, the editing was done well to allow the most important parts crucial to the films success. I would recommend reading the book to get more of the depth of the story because some parts had to be cut out completely, and these are no-doubt relevant to what happens later on. Mainly, these were more character-focused scenes to build up the characters rather than action scenes.The film is also less innocent than the original, and there is more detail in the scenes and more character to these scenes. It's very good, and this is a sure winner for Potter fans. Even if you're not a Potter fan, you will enjoy it. Just don't forget to read the books!",7,0,2,29 December 2005
The Fast and the Furious," so bad it made me furious
","'The Fast and the Furious' is probably only enjoyable for those cinema-goers who enjoy films about cars and ellaborate chase scenes and for girls who like to see Vin Diesel. This film had nothing going for it whatsoever (unless, of course, you are really into one of those subjects that I just mentioned). The film is all about fast cars and a little bit of crime with 'bad guys/bad girls' image. That sums up the entire film, which leaves little to the imagination and little anything to appreciate.I certainly will not be recommending this film to anyone. Hey, if you like nothing but watching cars race on screen and a little bit of 'bad guy/bad girl' gang life, then I hope you enjoy this. I personally think it is one of the worst movies that I've had the displeasure of seeing.",1,6,13,22 November 2005
Spirited Away," a breakthrough animation...
","'Spirited Away' is a haunting and imaginative story (a Japanese animation) about a young girl who ends up in a world filled with gods and amusing creatures and characters. She must save her parents, which have been turned into pigs by a witch, and she must avoid getting caught herself. 'Spirited Away' is a unique look at culture and at imagination; some of the concepts are completely different, so the film may seem odd to some who do not understand some of the elements behind it. 'Spirited Away' is an enchanting little story which engages the viewer at all times with its particular characters and situations, and it is a film that gives us hope. The animation is also done very well. This film is truly a gem!",6,1,5,7 April 2006
Independence Day," Silly, annoying, unrealistic
","'Independence Day' is a science-fiction thriller starring Will Smith in the role that made him famous. Regarded highly after its cinema release, the film's reputation now seems to have taken a turn for the worse. The film is patriotic in the annoying sense, and Will Smith's character is annoying as he battles the aliens and becomes an outspoken hero. It's also got those cheesy scenes - people and pets avoiding ultimate doom and somehow, miraculously surviving the destruction. In fact, 'Independence Day' is just another take on Wells' 'War of the Worlds', but it's America at the forefront of this disaster, which happens on its day of independence. I never enjoyed the film and thought it was a little long to sit through, but everyone else seemed to like it. I've noticed, however, that it seems to have lost its audience. If you like thrillers and liked the most recent version of 'War of the Worlds', then I think you may like this film.",3,4,7,30 December 2005
Batman Begins," At the beginning, I wanted it to end
","'Batman Begins' feels like the type of film produced for the audience who enjoyed the superhero films which are ever-popuar at the moment with the release of Spiderman and some of the other films. I think the project was taken on to revive Batman and to earn a little bit of extra money. The result was a poor film.'Batman Begins' is a slow film with several pacing mistakes and a generally uninteresting story about revenge and morals. The first half of the film is very slow and unengaging. At the end, it is packed with action, but the action is not as memorable as it is a cheap adrenaline thrill. Not to mention the poor acting and dialogue and generally uninteresting cast of characters in the typical superhero underdog story. Not for one second could I believe that Batman would admit to 'being frightened of bats' when asked why he choose to dress up like a giant bat. Being frightened of something does humanize the superhero, but it also makes him seem less of a superhero. (He could have just admitted to not liking bats.) The love story between Batman and Rachel was also poor. I think the film failed completely. Yes, it did have some decent action at the end, but that's all I will give it.",3,2,7,20 December 2005
Meet the Fockers," Not a consistent sequel, not funny
","'Meet the Fockers' the the sequel to 'Meet the Parents', which was a very good romantic comedy film involving a guy named Gaylord Focker who tries to fit in with his girlfriend's family. 'Meet the Fockers', however, is a horrible sequel with in-your-face comedy, which maybe only generated a couple of small laughs in the 1.5 hours of film. The humour in this film is not nearly as subtle as the original, and it is a ruder sense of humour which focuses primarily on sex. 'Meet the Parents' is a much better film with subtle humour across a wide range, and there is a sense of feeling for the characters, while the characters are thrown around in 'Meet the Fockers' to be as rude as they can be. (Humour such as the scene where the foreskin accidentally finds its way thrown into a pot of hot chocolate is rather disgusting - in my sense of humour - and not at all funny, but I guess that some people did find this funny.) I would suggest you see 'Meet the Parents' and do not bother with this film. It is completely different from the humour in 'Meet the Parents' that it is not a good sequel anyway. I am cringing about this poor film at this very moment and wishing that I had my money back.",3,2,4,22 January 2006
The Princess Bride," okay story but poor production
","'The Princess Bride' is a fantasy film about a man who goes to rescue a kidnapped princess that he has fallen in love with. The main problem that I had with this film is the production; the monsters and fights did not look realistic, and the romance was silly and awkward in places. The production of this film could have been much better. As a story, I think that the film succeeded. The way that it was presented as a tale from the grandfather to the boy also put it into perspective, but the production made it seem like an unprofessional film, and I did have trouble taking it seriously. As this film is generally well-liked by a wide audience, I would recommend it. Just try to not let the production put you off.",3,8,27,11 March 2006
Saving Private Ryan," excellent cinematography but slow story
","Although 'Saving Private Ryan' portrays excellent cinematography and probably a pretty accurate sense of being in a battle in the second World War, the film failed to do anything more. This film was probably made for its battle scenes, which I cannot fault at all and for which this movie does earn some credit for. However, in terms of story and characters, the film fails. Along with the story, the film has too many slow movements; overall, it is too long and tends to drag on. If they had spent as much time on the story as much as they spent on the cinematography, then we would have had a much better film. Watch it for the battle scenes and history if you watch it at all.",3,1,4,2 April 2006
Lawrence of Arabia," Visually magnificent
","The strongest element of this film is the camera's capture of the landscapes and the detail that was put into the visual elements of the film. By proportions, this film is an epic and certainly in a league of its own, similar to the title character himself. 'Lawrence of Arabia' is a film about an English soldier who helps the Arabs fight the Turks in the 1940s because he has a strong love for their culture and country. The film follows this man and how he influences others around him. The only downfall of this film is that it is often difficult to follow the story and to understand exactly the different players and reasoning behind some of their actions. (However, I do not think that this is a fault in the acting but probably a fault in the script.) Despite being a long film, this film is engaging - more-so for its visual and striking portrayals of landscape and battle scenes. Do not miss this film if you enjoy historical epics.",7,4,10,21 January 2006
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," If you liked the original, you will like this
","'Jurassic Park - the Lost World' is the second Jurassic Park film. This time, the characters go to an island where the dinosaurs are raised, and while they are trapped on the island, the basic thriller storyline takes place with killer dinosaurs and (I think) uninteresting characters that are destined to be dinosaur food anyway. I think that if you liked the original 'Jurassic Park' film, this film is basically the same with subtle differences. This type of story isn't for everyone, though. Like all thrillers, story is cheap and the thrill/giant monsters and special effects are just eye candy to provide some cheap gore on screen. Give me something with substance...",3,0,13,1 January 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," a good follow-up
","'X-Men The Last Stand' is a good follow up to the equally-entertaining previous films in the series. Despite the last film being released a couple of years ago, I remembered enough of the characters and plot to understand what was going on, but I think new viewers to the X-Men films will be lost if they did not see the previous ones.The film is packed with a lot of action and wacky new characters, and it also provides some good resolutions through a climax of conflicts between the mutants and the humans. It is not a flawless film, but it does its job, which is to entertain. The action sequences and special effects are done well, and there is rarely a dull moment in context of he film. I would recommend this film but only after watching the previous two.",6,0,2,28 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A beautiful epic!
","One of the most beautiful films of all time, 'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is much more coherent and action-packed than the previous film in the trilogy. The action gets under way here, and the characters are separated and overcoming their own problems and battles as the time draws nearer when Frodo must succeed in accomplishing the huge task that he has been assigned. Along the way, friendships grow and more evolve in the most unlikely places. There is plenty of humor, sadness, action, and fantasy in this film. Like 'Fellowship of the Ring', 'The Two Towers' uses the beautiful scenery to convey the burdens of the journey and the beauty that there is in the world gradually succumbing to the evil wizard. This film has a lot going for it that makes it succeed on so many levels.",10,0,0,18 January 2006
The Incredibles," Good except for the ending(s)
","'The Incredibles' is a story about a family of superheroes who learn how to work together in order to defeat the villain and all of the technology that he can throw at them. The animation is done pretty well, and the story combines plenty of action and comedy. It is a pretty enjoyable film, but the main problem that I had with this film was the ending. (You can count on a sequel coming in a few years.) In fact, there are a couple of endings, and the last ending seems to leave you hanging, almost literally. It looks as if they wanted to wrap it all up but could not decide which ending to use, and they also wanted to make a sequel. Despite this, the film was pretty good, but the multiple ending thing really annoyed me.",4,0,3,30 December 2005
Ghostbusters," A fun film nastalgic of the 1980s
","One of the most popular films of the 1980s, Ghostbusters succeeded in capturing an audience and keeping a following well after the 1980s. The 1980s and this film seem to be tied together. It was a huge hit with a product range, a sequel, and a cartoon series -- not to mention the catchy theme song: 'I ain't afraid of no ghosts.' Ghostbusters is a fun film. The story centers around a group of men who start a business 'busting' ghosts. It's all very fantasy and super-hero themed with the ghost busters saving the city from the dooms of the spook-world, but it does have an element of comedy. In fact, it almost does not take itself seriously. Even the villain puffy mashmallow man is comical.The film is worth a watch, especially if you've seen it before and want to watch it again. I don't think it has lost any charm. It will always be a fun film, and it is easy to see why it had the following with its humor and superhero story.",8,0,0,28 November 2005
Back to the Future Part III," They should have stopped after the last trip on the time machine
","I think it was time to retire the old time machine. The second film got away with being decent, but this film went too far, and the villain (although related to Biff) is not as strong a character. This film is more like a western with native Americans, cowboys, and run-away trains. Yes, it is packed with action, but it is missing that extra edge that the other two films had. It also replaced the comedy element by becoming a little more serious. In short, it just did not do it for me, and it's not a very good film. It weakens the trilogy, in my opinion. I'm glad that they retired the time machine after this to prevent even worse films capitalizing off the title.",4,2,11,13 November 2005
Men in Black II," Poor film, lack's the original's charm
","'Men in Black 2' is the sequel to the film starring Will Smith, a comical FBI-style agent in charge of the department to keep aliens on Earth under control. As a sequel, it works poorly, and a lot of the charm that was in the original (laughter, character relationships) is forgotten in this film. The moments that were supposed to be funny were not funny, and I found Will Smith to irritate me a lot in this film. I would not recommend this film as a good follow-up to the original, and I would not recommend that anyone see this unless they are a huge fan of the original. Just remember to expect nothing so you won't be disappointed.",2,0,2,26 January 2006
Wimbledon," Poor and Lacking Storyline
","I think that this film lacked what it needed to really make a great film. Perhaps this is because I am not keen on watching sport itself. Most of the story focuses on Wimbledon, and there is a love story weaved into this. I'm not a fan of either genre, and I didn't have any expectations. I think the film lacks overall emotion, conflict, and storyline direction. This is not saying that the director went wrong or the actors/actresses could not act. I feel that the majority of the problem lay within the script itself. I could not place myself in the characters' shoes, and the conflicts that did occur throughout seemed to be played down (the parents, father figure, American tennis player who went to the finals). There were a couple of funny bits, but nothing is really memorable. Below average: rated 2 out of 10.",2,4,7,3 October 2004
Kelly's Heroes," Bizarre, funny World War 2 film
","'Kelly's Heroes' is a World War Two film about a group of soldiers who go to steal Nazi treasures, and they fight the Germans along the way. It's got battles and comedy, and it's a pretty good film if you're just after some military-related fun. It also has a pretty good soundtrack with the song 'Burning Bridges'. It's certainly a different take on a war film, and there isn't another film quite like it. (Sure, 'Big Red One' was another comedy World War 2 film, but I think it lacked the substance.) The insane character (I forget his name as it has been a while since I last saw this) is very funny, and there is some good fun with Germans in the film too. The only problem that I had with the film is that it moved a little slow, and it's really a film about the comedy than it is a masterpiece. As a film, it's about average. If you like war films, you will enjoy it, and you'll enjoy the humour too.",4,1,10,1 January 2006
Caddyshack," that gopher...
","'Caddyshack' is one of those films that many people seem to really love. Yes, it has a few funny moments and a few funny scenarios, but there really is not that much more to it. I personally found the film to be annoying. (The most memorable was the gopher incident, and this is probably a running - err, digging - joke among those who enjoy their games of golf.) I don't think this film is for everyone. I mean, I certainly did not enjoy it. Then again, I have never played golf in my life; I don't watch it on television either. If you enjoy golf, you will probably enjoy some of the jokes in this film, but it is not for everyone and the humor is not for everyone.",2,9,24,18 October 2005
Shrek 2," witty, good animation...Better than the first
","'Shrek 2' is a better story, in my opinion, than the first film. The animation is still done very well, and the characters and scenarios are much funnier, and I think it appeals to a wider audience (both adults and children). While watching this film, I could tell that the people who created it had a lot of fun; this is evident in the attention to detail and some of the inside jokes. In summary, this film follows Shrek and his fiancé to meet his fiancé's parents. Along the way, they meet Puss 'n' Boots and learn how to be happy with themselves for who they are without trying to have society mould them into being what it wants. The story and situations are more memorable than the first film's, and the conflict and action sequences are also done better and with a sense of humor. Again, all of the characters are voiced well and bring a strong sense of emotion and fun to the animated characters. I recommend this to children and adults. There is plenty of humor and enjoyable moments for both children and adults, and all age groups will be influenced in a slightly different manner. There's also some good morals to the story.",8,0,1,7 May 2006
A Bug's Life," A story of cute bugs
","A Bug's Life is a cute film that can be enjoyed by both adults and children. Like most family films, it has a colourful array of characters and the typical cruel but incompetent (and often amusing) villains. Not only are the characters lovable and the story fun, but A Bug's Life is also a learning experience and a story about morals and teamwork. It is a good film in which to escape into the tiny world of insects.A Bug's Life can be enjoyed by the family, and it is certainly more enjoyable than Antz, which was released around the same time. The only problem with A Bug's Life is the pacing of the story. In some scenes, too much happens and leads to confusion. Other scenes are slow and drawn out. It's not the best animation out there, but it's still a good film and worth watching on a rainy day.",5,1,3,10 October 2005
Big Fish," Simply a good, big tale
","'Big Fish' is a magical, big tale about an ordinary guy who becomes unordinary and lives a big tale. It captures a southern US father and his relationship with his son, who fails to believe his big tales until a moving experience brings them closer together and closer to 'reality'. It is ultimately the tale of a father/son relationship as much as it is a tale about the unusual and adventurous life that his father leads and the unusual characters he befriends along the way to a successful and magical life.The film is full of symobolism, but it is often a little too simplistic, and I felt that the plot could have developed more in some areas. This could have been a much longer film, and I think that it needed to be longer in order to tell some of the story, but it does fairly well as it stands. I felt that some of the scenes were rushed and that some of the detail and additional scenes could have made this a much better film.I don't think this film is for everyone, but if you're after a good story about characters and want to watch something original, then I suggest spending an evening with this film.",8,1,2,28 December 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," I wasn't impressed
","2001: A Space Odyssey is regarded by some as one of the best films in history. I am not one of those people. Although it is an escape into the future and into space with underlying political and cultural messages common in 1960s films, the film did little to impress me. Maybe it is because of the time that I was born into. I felt that a lot of the movie went along very slowly, from the peaceful apes throwing sticks into the air to the scenes of astronauts floating in space, abandoned by their large metal craft.I wouldn't recommend this film to the average movie viewer, but it is one of those films that should be watched by serious film viewers. No guarantees that you will think it's the best film ever made. It certainly isn't in my eyes.",5,2,10,23 October 2005
Men in Black," Not great but worth a few laughs
","'Men In Black' is a science-fiction/comedy film involving a branch of the FBI responsible for dealing with aliens on Earth (I'm sure this involves a few people that I have met over the years.). Will Smith's character falls into a position with this department of the FBI and helps to add the comical element of the film, which is annoying at times and funny at others. If you enjoy science-fiction but are not particularly into watching a serious film, then this film is enjoyable. Do not expect it to be a great film, but expect it to be one in which you can watch and laugh with and then forget about. I would not bother with the sequel as it is not very funny and rates much lower than this film, in my opinion.",6,1,5,26 January 2006
The Graduate," Taboo themes contribute to its popularity
","'The Graduate' owes some of the popularity down to its portrayal of taboo events surrounding an older, married woman and a young graduate. In summary, the movie is about their relationship and about the young graduate uncertain of his future. The ending scene is classic and memorable, and it's one of those scenes that has probably achieved high, unforgettable status in the film world.The music by Simon and Garfunkel is probably one of the best elements of the film. Definitely, give this film a watch. It has several good scenes, but don't expect too much because its so often mentioned. Personal rating: Average.",4,5,13,1 December 2005
Pride & Prejudice," Pride and Prejudice - Excellent use of cinematography to capture the characters
","Pride and Prejudice captures the essence of Jane Austen's book, paying great attention to both characters and detail to create an emotional screen adaption. This is one film that uses cinematography to an advantage in capturing lush landscapes, enhancing the feelings of the characters with appropriate camera angles and shots, and representing period history through costume and rich rural landscape. I expect that everyone who sees this film will be 'blown away' by the cinematography, which is used in a major way to tell the story of Elizabeth and her family and Mr. Darcy.This screen adaption succeeds in attracting an audience through familiar faces and a timeless classic, which should not be regarded solely as a great love story but should be regarded as a timeless classic portraying social history and a class system. (This film has the potential to be enjoyed by many different types of individual.) In conclusion, Pride and Prejudice succeeds in this screen adaption through excellent cinematography that enhances the characters and emotions while representing a class structure. Good job. 7/10.",7,7,15,18 September 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," brilliant, breath-taking, highly original
","'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a brilliant and highly original film, often provoking a lot of thought and revealing its plot gradually. It is, in my opinion, one of the best films of 2004.It's hard to really summarize the plot without spoiling it because the film releases it gradually, but this is the best I can do without spoiling it. The film is about a couple who had been in a relationship and who had undergone psychological treatments to rid them of the painful memories so that they can start their separate life again. Little did they know that they are being brought back together by fate, and they soon realize what they had. The film also features a couple minor subplots, but you'll have to watch the film to see what they are.I don't know how I'd classify this film. It's not quite a romance, and it's not quite science-fiction. But, it is probably the type of film any of us who have been in a painful relationship can relate to.Artistic and well done in nearly every aspect, this film deserved more recognition than it received. (I only fault it slightly in that I was able to predict the plot quite early on - although others I saw the film with did not, and that it did go a little overboard with the ending and seemed to lose direction when the whole story before that was done beautifully.) However, I think it is an excellent film, despite the few (very few) faults. I highly recommend this film.",6,1,4,17 November 2005
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Hilarious, almost as good as the original
","'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York' sees the return of Kevin (played by Culkin). Instead of being left at home while his family goes on vacation, Kevin accidentally gets on the wrong plane and ends up in New York City. He coincidently meets the villain bandits from the last film, and they are set on robbing a toy store. Kevin sets out to stop them once again, and more hilarious slapstick comedy resumes. Not quite as good as the first film, 'Home Alone 2' still carries the Christmas spirit and spreads that warm, holiday feeling. Along with the comedy aspect come the moral subplots involving friendship/family and the meaning of Christmas. Overall, it is done very well, but the novelty has worn off between films because both are very similar. They're still creative in the comedy aspect, however, and it's worth a watch over the holidays.",6,0,1,30 December 2005
A Clockwork Orange," over-rated and average
","I think that this film is one of the most over-rated films of all time. I would rate it below average - extra points go to the originality and art. I feel that the film lacks coherence, and I had a difficult time actually being interested throughout the film. I am not entirely sure what Kubrick was trying to achieve here, but in my personal opinion, I think this film was over-rated. I think the reason why it is so popular is that it questions life, and it focuses on taboo topics. There's the element of 'shock value' and the fact that no one else would have dared to make a film like this.Overall, I have seen much better films and I don't know what all the hype is about.",2,12,25,19 March 2004
National Treasure," Fun but not excellent
","'National Treasure' is an adventure film about a young man and son of a long lineage of masons who makes it his personal task to hunt down some treasure from the early days of the United States of America. In the process, several key symbols of American history are examined, including the Liberty Bell and the Declaration of Independence. The film is ultimately a history lesson with plenty of Indiana Jones-style adventure and a little bit of romance. There's also conflict between the characters as the villains who want to steal the treasure out of greed are hot on the tails of the heroes. It's action-packed, but it's really not a very deep film, and it does go quite quickly, but it has nothing completely wonderful about it. It's just a pretty good action film. Don't expect a wonderful film, but expect to be entertained for over an hour.",5,1,3,7 February 2006
Rocky," an iconic film
","'Rocky' is a film about a boxer who goes to ultimate levels to become a champion of the ring. Along the way, he gathers confidence and meets a young woman who gives him the strength that he needs. This is a story of endurance and love, and it is one of the most quoted films of all time with the line 'Yo, Adrian! I did it!' There's also the famous clips of Rocky running, getting exercise to build up his endurance. This is filmed with the Rocky theme, 'Gonna Fly Now'. The story drags on a little bit, but those moments are worth fighting for. Not a bad film, and it does have a good choice of music and gives you a sense of hope.",4,7,19,20 March 2006
Hoosiers," It's not for everyone
","'Hoosiers' is a film about a rural basketball team and their coach, and it's one of those feel-good, spiritual films that probably have their target audience in the midwestern states in America. While I can see that some may enjoy the film, I found it difficult to sit through because I do not enjoy watching/following basketball, and it was just a little too flowery and feel-good for my liking. It's the typical underdog sports story where the team and the coach overcome the hurdles then go to win it all. Very touching, but it did nothing for me. Basketball and sports fans will probably love this film, but I am not within that target audience.",2,3,12,30 December 2005
Pulp Fiction," great method of story-telling
","'Pulp Fiction' scores extra stars for setting up an original way of story-telling. The story is told from end to beginning (well, sort of), and it follows a few characters who get caught up in some misunderstanding or mess involving crime or criminal. Thoroughly engaging but often warped and funny, this film is a pleasure to watch. In the final scenes, the viewer learns how the different stories of the characters are connected, bringing an even closer meaning to the film. 'Pulp Fiction' is very creative in its story-telling method. That is what makes this a good film, and without it, this film would be dull and like any other film.",7,3,6,17 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Dull
","'The Da Vinci Code' is an action/adventure film about a man who stumbles fatefully into a mystery surrounding the death of a man at the Louvre gallery. The mystery surrounds Jesus and his relationship with others attempting to seek out the truth and destroy it and destroy him. The film flits from scene to scene, but there is little that engages the viewer. (I expected the film to be more engaging because the book was in the best-seller charts for months.) The performances of the actors is probably the best element of the film, sadly. The plot moved a little too slowly with some elements of the plot that seem to be strange coincidences. (For example, the main character was linked to the Teacher through a friendship with him. I could understand how, based on their interests, they two were good friends, but I found it less believable for the Teacher to be the villain and the one leading the chase.) Unfortunately, the film was dull and this will be one that I won't watch again. If you plan to see it, do not expect a lot.",5,0,3,28 May 2006
Rocky III," the most emotional Rocky
","'Rocky III' is the third part in the Rocky story. This is the part where they should have stopped, after this film. (It does have some good moments, but it is not nearly as good as the previous two.) It goes all downhill from here on out. After the death of a dear friend and personal trainer, Rocky and Apollo team up together to train Rocky to get him back competing. This is a story about loss and about trying to get back onto one's feet again after dealing with loss. It's a touching story, but I don't think it is as strong, and I do not think the fighting scenes and the production was as good as the second one. See it if you are a fan.",2,2,7,20 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Not as good as the book, but still magical
","'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is the introduction film to the Harry Potter series based on the best-selling book. The film is as sweet and as engaging as the book, introducing the underdog Harry, who was forced to live in the closet under the stairs by his mean aunt and uncle and who does not have a happy, loving family. He learns that he is actually from a magical family, and this takes him to a magical school called Hogwarts where he meets two good friends Hermione and Ron and unfortunately makes some enemies with a couple bullies. The three friends find themselves solving mysteries and becoming heroes. It's quite well-written with a twist at the end. Overall, it is a good introduction to the characters and contains some innocent fun and some action that is truly magical.",6,0,2,29 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Worthwhile but not my favourite
","'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is a decent film adaption and succeeds in being the best that it can be. The film did leave a lot out, but some of this was not as relevant to the story, and a lot of the details were taken out completely. However, the film does not lose its focus and the audience should be encouraged to read the book to get the extra scenes and information that cannot fit into the film. (I suggest that the book be read anyway, as both the film and the book compliment each other.) 'Goblet of Fire' is not my favourite Harry Potter story. It is one of the darkest stories, but the book seems to lose itself in an over-indulgence of events. The film avoids this and keeps a better focus, in my opinion. Horomones play a major part of the story as well. The main events were the three games and the ball. Both the film and the book seem to fail in an overall goal, and there seems to be less direction. It's really just from one game to the next and who can get a date for the ball, and who has a crush on who. It does not make the best Harry Potter story, and I missed the strong relationship between Harry, Hermione, and Ron. And, I did not care for the introduction of the new characters. (Realistic although it is for children to fall out with their friends, I missed the charm of the old novels/films and the adventures that the three main characters got themselves into.) Despite its flaws in a lacking story and some poor acting (disguised by some good special effects and other distractions), the film is worth watching. I'd even say that they've done a pretty good job with the adaption of the script. Not the best, but it's worthwhile.",5,1,1,27 November 2005
It's a Wonderful Life," One of the best films ever made
","'It's a Wonderful Life' is quite simply one of the best films ever made. It's emotional and insightful, and it is everything that a good film should be. George Bailey is the main character in this film, and the film follows his life and the sacrifices that he has had to make to benefit the common good of the people. Without him, everyone around him would suffer. However, George Bailey gets into some trouble, and it takes a quirky little Guardian Angel without wings to sort George out. It's an emotional and sad little story that is sure to put you in the right frame of mind for the holidays. I think that everyone should see this film as it certainly is a classic.",10,2,8,31 December 2005

","Although over-rated, this film is made well. We get a decent story and some good performances by the actors and actresses, and it is shot beautifully. However, this film seems to be made for a wide audience and to make money. In part, I think its popularity helped it to win an Oscar, and it's an over-rated film in my opinion. (I don't think this film deserved an Oscar because there were equally good or better films produced that year.) It's good, but I've seen better. It was almost there, but it just didn't make it in my category of top films. Cinematography was probably the best single thing about the film. Average and over-rated.",5,1,4,13 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," a good adaption
","'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is a pretty good adaption of the second book in the Potter series. In this book, Harry is warned by a house elf not to go back to Hogwarts school. Strange things start to happen, and a new portal is opened up, and this forces Harry to meet and to learn more about his enemy. It is up to Harry to become the hero again while trying to fit in.The film introduces more special effects and action than the first film, but I thought it was a weaker story than the first book. (That, of course, is my personal preference.) The giant spiders and giant snake are pretty realistic (spider-phobes and snake-phobes beware).This film is another success for the Harry Potter story, and I think that fans are overall pleased. It's got the innocent and fun-loving characters that the original had, which is why the story is so popular, and combine this with the action and you get a successful film. My only problem is that I did not find this story as interesting as the other Potter books, and I felt that some of the acting was not the best...still, I don't think it distracted from the story. Overall, job well done and a good adaption.",6,1,2,29 December 2005
Psycho," iconic
","'Psycho' is one of the most iconic films of all time, and this film had a huge impact with an audience, and it has been considered one of the best films ever made. It is the sort of film that haunts us with its gradual build-up to disaster, excellent cinematography, and its ability to allow the user to imagine the horrible events taking place. (The creepiness of this film is in the stuffed animals at the beginning of the film, the huge house upon the hill, the darkness of the night, and that unforgettable and iconic shower scene.) This film is the master of suspense with some great camera angles. Mr. Bates ascending and descending the staircase in the empty, creepy house with the body of his mother heightens the horrors. It is easy to put oneself in the place of the characters. This film will keep one engaged with the constant action and the mystery. There's even a little element of humour and disgust. This is definitely one of the best films of all time. Everyone should see this at least once in their life.",8,1,3,17 March 2006
The Holiday," A good holiday romantic comedy for once!
","I usually go to the cinema disappointed with romantic comedies; they are not a genre of film I enjoy because they tend to be lacking in storyline or tend to be a little too cheesy. However, I did enjoy 'The Holiday', a film about two women (one from the UK and one from the USA) with troubled love lives who swap houses. Both women end up improving some aspect in their life and finding romance at the same time. The film has a list of well-known actors and actresses. It's just a happy little romantic comedy for the holiday season and it succeeds where 'Love Actually' fails. The story is a good one, and it's a complex series of stories for each character. The film is filled with surprises, and well - it's a must-see for the holiday, even if you don't care for this genre, you'll be surprised.",6,0,1,10 December 2006
Love Actually," Love Actually: super-sweet romantic comedy
","'Love Actually' is a typical British romantic comedy film with a long list of well-known stars. This film is all about love and consists of several different stories that demonstrate love and relationships and how different people behave in their relationships. (We see the prime minister strike up a relationship with an intern, a writer falling in love with a non-English speaking foreign girl, a married woman suspecting that her husband is cheating on her, and many more scenarios similarly and globally linked. It's a super-sweet film, and if you enjoy films with a so-happy-they-are-sad ending, then you will like this one. Do not bother if you do not care for this genre of film because you will be bored.",3,3,6,19 January 2006
Ice Age," Fun, fresh, engaging - and the best trailer I've seen
","'Ice Age' is a fresh and original animation taking place among animal misfits in the ice age. The unlikely animals band together to form a friendship based on returning a human baby to its parents and avoiding the evil sabre-toothed tigers from stealing the baby. Hilarious events take place on their journey, and it is a deeply engaging and fresh film. Children and adults both can enjoy this film.I remember catching the trailer for this film in 2000 - several times. The trailer itself was a work of art. As soon as the little squirrel came on the screen with his acorn, the audience was immediately hushed and wrapped up in the unfolding action. I have never seen an audience react so intensely on a film trailer. I think that they did a very good job putting the trailer together, and it is - by far - the most effective trailer I have ever seen. Watching the audience's response to this trailer time and time again was wonderful.I was amazed at how good the animation was. It's not totally realistic animation, but they did a good job at keeping it simple and not letting it distract from the action. The 'feel' of the film reminded me of 'The Lion King', but this story was much better; I was also not annoyed with the sloth character, but I was annoyed with Timon and Pumba from 'The Lion King'. I thought that all of the characters, including the secondary ones, were quite charming in their own individual aspects. It's a touching little animation, and I recommend this to both adults and children.",7,0,2,30 December 2005
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A story of characters
","The Bridge on the River Kwai is an up-lifting and moving film centering around the behavior and determination of captured soldiers during the second World War. It is a film about characters more than a film about war. Watching this film gives me a sense of feeling for the characters and hopes that they will succeed. Overall, this film provides some good observations between the relationships that the soldiers and those higher in command (on both sides of the war). This is greatly helped through good acting, and the realistic setting puts everything in to perspective. Overall, The Bridge on the River Kwai is a feel-good film about characters and determination. It is definitely worth a watch.",5,3,12,5 October 2005
A Hard Day's Night," A great documentary, rich cinematography
","'A Hard Day's Night' is an excellent Beatlemania documentary, showing an important piece of history in music. The film is not a traditional documentary, but it is a non-traditional documentary in the sense that it portrays the life of the Beatles at the height of Beatlemania. One of the most excellent aspects of the film is the excellent and artistic cinematography; director Richard Lester knew how to capture engaging moments to prevent this film from becoming dull and unengaging. The scene with the Beatles in the playing field (shot in one day from helicopter) is one of the most memorable scenes.The humour in the film is done well, and it captures the individual personalities of the Beatles and the problems that they had with the media interfering in their lives - which is an important and unavoidable part. The best acting in this film was done by Ringo. The film captures his loneliness and loss of feeling of unacceptance. The scene where he walks down by the river after taking photographs is touching and acted out very well; it is easy to feel sympathy.The music on 'A Hard Day's Night' album is also among the best that the Beatles performed, and there are several excellent film clips throughout the film that make this a historical music documentary.It's thoroughly an enjoyable film packed with humour, rich cinematography, and excellent music. The only downfall of the film is that it moves rather slowly in some places; the cinematography and the music help bring it back into focus, but the script is not as engaging and it would fail as a story on its own. It is a must-see for Beatles fans and music enthusiasts. This film should be shown in music history classes. It is an excellent insight into the successful career of the Beatles.",7,4,8,29 December 2005
The Green Mile," original, artistic, spiritual
","'The Green Mile' is a prison film like no other. It's a story told from the point of view of a prison guard (Tom Hanks) about one special prisoner with magical healing powers and the people in his unfortunate life. The film has an artistic and deep psychological meaning behind it. It's got a sense of a spiritual theme throughout; the main prisoner could be seen as a Christ figure who magically heals those around him and who is wrongly accused of a crime and sentenced to death. It is a moving and emotional story with several engaging and interesting characters and a deep, spiritual plot.If you enjoyed 'The Shawshank Redemption', you'll probably enjoy this. I'm not saying 'The Green Mile' is as good or better than this other film, but it is similar in some respects (spiritual themes, etc.).",7,0,2,7 December 2005
The Lion King," I'm in the minority - I didn't like it
","'The Lion King' is a Disney animation about a lion cub named Simba who runs away from his responsibility after thinking that he is to blame for his father's fate. Along the way, Simba meets Timon and Pumba, the comical sidekicks. It's a sad film, but it is a film about life, and it is realistic in that sense. However, 'The Lion King' is probably my least favourite Disney animation. Although Timon and Pumba are supposed to provide the comic relief, I found the couple very annoying. Yes, this film had huge success in the 1990s, but I was never impressed with it. Most people seem to really enjoy this film, so I am probably in the majority for giving it a low rating, but I just did not think it was that good of a film.",2,28,93,16 January 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," a rare gem
","'The Shawshank Redemption' is a prison film and a good film about characters. The film is about a man who is put into prison for murdering his wife, a crime that he did not commit. He ends up helping the prison guards out, and some complicated issues arise. The film is about characters, loyalty, revenge, and freedom. This film is one of its kind; it is almost spiritual as it touches on many different aspects of life. The story is thoroughly engaging as are the characters, and the different situations that the characters are in keep the viewer guessing and hungry for more. This film is a rare gem that lives up to its expectations.",8,0,0,10 April 2006
Music and Lyrics," fun & not too serious
","'Music and Lyrics' is a film that you can sit back and enjoy on a weekend evening. The film has a witty story and flawed characters who come together to help each other out. Coinciding with its release date near Valentine's Day, it is the perfect film for couples. The film is not complicated, and it uses wit in remembering the cliché boy bands and music videos of the 1980s. This also brings us into today's world of modern pop music and follows the creative process of song-writing between an older 1980s has-been and a young, insecure female writer. The music in the film is done very well and is also very strong. Simply, this is a good feel-good film to watch when you need to wind down.",6,0,0,19 February 2007
Scream," not scary
","Typical plot for a horror film. A group of teenagers are being murdered by someone who dresses in funny costume/masks. The deaths are pretty horrific, with plenty of heart-racing chase scenes and gory, creative deaths. This film seems to have gathered a cult following, probably because most people did find this film to be horrific. However, when I saw the film, I just laughed at the antics and the character dramas unfolding. It is suspenseful, and it is gory, and most people did consider this frightening. However, if you do not like this type of film or are looking for something a little more than a cliché, then do not bother with this one. This goes for the original 'Scream' and 'Scream 3'; I have not seen the second one.",1,3,20,2 April 2006
Back to the Future Part II," Not as good as the first
","This is the second film in the Back to the Future trilogy. Where the first focused more about going back into the past, this film went into the future - Marty's future. We have the same villain Biff and his gang, which does work well in this film and helps to keep the same 'feel' that the first film had. In fact, it is similar in a lot of ways, but it's not quite as good as the original. It's worth a watch, if only to see how poorly it has dated.However, there are some pretty good and funny scenes, but the original film is a lot better, and I would recommend that one over this one. Still, good and one of the films I grew up with.",7,0,2,13 November 2005
Raging Bull," A champion masterpiece
","Move over, Rocky. 'Raging Bull' is the ultimate boxing film. This film, released in 1980, was shot in black and white. This film is a portrayal of a boxer and his failing relationship with his wife and his determination to succeed. The starkness of the contrast of the black and white picture makes the film seem harder, and the camera shots and angles of the fight are captured perfectly and flawlessly. This is heightened even more with the stark contrast in colour and helps show the darkness of the blood. There are also good performances by the actors and actresses, and the story is an interesting one where one can feel for the characters. This is iconic and brilliantly created, and I recommend this film to anyone, even if boxing is not really something you enjoy. Do not give this one a miss.",8,1,2,18 March 2006
Shrek," Beautiful animation, performances. second film is better
","'Shrek' is a beautifully-animated film about an ugly troll (Shrek) who learns how to find an inner beauty during his adventure rescuing a beautiful princess. The film is witty, bringing together several voice talents which bring the characters to life and create an interesting fairy-tale story involving several fairy-tale characters. While the animation and the characters are done very well, the story itself seems a little weak and slow in places. There is a lot of humor in the story, but this often got annoying and distracted from the story. In my opinion, the second film is much better than this one, but this one should be enjoyed by children (and adults), and it does have some good lessons. I give this film slightly above average because the animation is good, and the performances are done well.",6,0,1,7 May 2006
Mr. Holland's Opus," another feel-good film
","'Mr. Holland's Opus' is the classic student-teacher relationship film. (This film is similar to 'Renaissance Man'; replace a few keywords in the plot, and you basically get the same story.) Mr. Holland feels like a failure, and he has the desire to create a musical masterpiece. In order to pay the bills, he gets a job as a teacher at a school, and he teaches them how to appreciate music; this allows them to learn how to appreciate life. Simply, this film is another example of one of those feel-good films that fills you with a lot of hope. It moves a little slowly, but I think it succeeds in providing the viewer with a sense of hope. Not an excellent film, but it is not a great one either.",4,3,8,18 March 2006
Ben-Hur," a timeless classic
","Ben Hur is a timeless classic set in Biblical times. Beautifully shot, performed, and written, this film has many memorable scenes and moments. The chariot race is one of those memorable, gripping scenes. Another touching scene is where Hur is offered water by the Jesus character - a scene that is referenced later in the film. In short, Ben Hur is a story about suffering and loss, and it is a story of love, hope, and miracles. It features love and betrayal, revenge and forgiveness. In fact, it has all of the elements which make a good film. The only problem that I had with this film is that it feels like it is two stories in one. While the majority of the film seems to focus around Hur's misfortune and finding a way to get back home, another story evolves upon his return home. Direction seems to be lost here, after Ben Hur comes back home and then decides to locate his missing mother and sister. This second story is more spiritual and turns the misfortunes of the Hur family around, so we get a pretty happy ending. In conclusion, Ben Hur is definitely one of those films that have to be seen at least once. Chances are, you will enjoy it as most people tend to rate this film highly.",9,2,5,13 November 2005
Casino Royale," Not the best Bond film
","While 'James Bond' is entertaining action-packed and contains a cast of criminals even more unusual and evil than the criminals in previous Bond films, you cannot go too wrong if you are looking for a little light entertainment. However, this film just did not seem to do it for me. First of all, the film was much too long. The location and type of action kept changing throughout without a build-up. The film tried to do too much, and then it left you suspended at the end.The best part of the film was the card-playing sequence when we learned there was more than meets the eye to the situation there. This had suspense, action, and everything that the film needed but failed throughout.I was also not happy about the sensitive side to this Bond with him falling head-pver-heels with the girl and planning to leave his job for her. I preferred the cool, stoic Bonds. However, it was refreshing and good to get a different character to Bond - and one a little more flawed in some areas.",3,4,7,10 December 2006
Signs," two stories, one conclusion
","'Signs' is a film about a widowed father and minister from rural America. The film combines two stories: one of the father and his ability to deal with his wife's death while making sense of the alien invasion through the eyes of his religion. The other story is more science-fiction in nature with people hiding in horror as they try to overcome the aliens and protect themselves. The film has some lessons to learn and settles the story in a way that encompasses both plots together nicely. The family-life plot was a little too slow moving for me, and it felt forced and silly/patriotic/sympathetic. It humanized the main character too much, and it distracted from the science-fiction part of the film. Special effects were also done well and were believable. The aliens did look frightening, and showing less in some instances was more because it made the story seem even more frightening and realistic.",3,2,3,13 May 2006
The Sixth Sense," average
","'The Sixth Sense' is a horror film about a young boy who has the power to see the ghosts of people who have passed away. The boy gets help from a psychologist and tries to learn how to fit in and know a normal life. The film succeeds in playing the horror as well as cinematography and a plot that makes the audience think. Most of the horror in the film is portrayed in a way that gets the imagination to work and plays on suspense. The plot is engaging and it also makes the audience think. However, I thought that it was predictable and knew what was happening before the end of the film. The performances are done well, and this film does have several strong points, but as a film overall, I think that it was average.",5,2,3,18 June 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Breathtaking
","'Return of the King' was one of the best films that I have seen in a long while, and it has helped to fill a void and get audiences more interested in fantasy films. Like the previous two films in the trilogy, the photography and use of scenery is amazing. The cast of characters and the battle scenes were also done extremely well and set to an equally-beautiful soundtrack. This is one of the best films in film history and almost equal to 'Star Wars'. It has a good mix of action, adventure, and character development. It's also the most emotional of the films.The main problem that I did have with this film is the lack of an answer regarding the evil wizard. In fact, this was cut completely from the cinema release. The wizard was the face of evil in the previous two films, and he suddenly disappears, leaving an empty and unexplained face of evil. Despite that, the film is excellent in every other way.",10,7,13,18 January 2006
The Matrix," Good idea and special effects
","'The Matrix' is a film about the concept of reality and identity. The lead character is transformed into an alternate world through the help of Morpheus, and he learns to battle the machines. This is a very deep film, and it is one that will make you think about life and reality. It's also a film that can be watched multiple times. One of the best areas of this film is the use of special effects in the battle scenes where the cameras rotate fully around the action. This is the highlight of the film, and without that, it would be almost like any other science-fiction/action movie. In my opinion, the story and characters are a little bit weak, but the concept and the special effects make this movie well-worth a watch.",6,2,4,22 January 2006
Apollo 13," Houston, we have a problem. Over-rated.
","Apollo 13 suffers from the fact that it was regarded highly as a film and is, in my opinion, very much over-rated. Apollo 13 is based on a true story about the space mission. I do believe that it was successful in getting the mainstream interested about the history of space missions and space exploration in general. In that sense, it did not fail. It also did not fail in the sense that it did capture an audience and bring about the timeless quotation: 'Houston, we have a problem.' Yes, they *did* have a problem, and I am speaking about the film here and not the mission.The problem with Apollo 13 is the slow pace of the film and the length of it. Yes, it is based on a true story, but that does not mean that it has to be so boring a dry. (A lot of the technical speak went over my head as a 16-year-old.) In terms of overall art direction or cinematography, the film was average. In short, it was just a very dry film and a long film to sit through. (The fact that it was rated highly and that the ending is well-known also probably did not help matters.) Overall, my personal opinion of this film is similar to the most famous quotation in the film: 'Houston, we have a problem.'",3,15,58,13 October 2005
Fantastic Four," Unoriginal
","The Fantastic Four is a typical comic book adventure, riding on the back of recent success in this genre. Although it is packed full of action, there is really little else to the film - and this certainly does not make the film memorable and/or unique. It certainly isn't original, and next to some of the other films of this genre, it adds very little.The ending is as familiar as any other film in this genre, with an expectation of more action yet to come. (So typical.) And the science behind the special powers is far from believable - I felt that other stories of this genre had better and more-thought-out scientific explanations.In short, this film fails to captivate in terms of originality and storyline. If you're a comic book fanatic, I'd recommend it, but don't expect much. If you're not, then there are much better films in this genre to see. If you're just looking for a little action, it may be worth it in between a slow-moving plot.",3,2,5,1 August 2005
The Great Escape," A great escape
","'The Great Escape' is a film based on a true story about Allied prisoners of war at a German camp who have a plan to tunnel an escape. Filled with great characters who each play a part in the scheme, great music, and plenty of adventure, this film gets the adrenaline rising. It's a thoroughly good film, and I highly recommend that everyone see it at least once in their life. (With each viewing, I think it is appreciated more.) It's easy to get caught up in the action and to see where the plot takes the characters, and this film is a legend of prisoner of war films. You see references to it everywhere. I highly recommend 'The Great Escape'.",8,5,8,1 December 2005
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," You'll love it or hate it
","Considered a classic British film, 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' combines outrageous comedy with an outlandish script for an ultimate experience involving King Arthur and the knights searching for the Holy Grail. If you enjoyed the Monty Python television series, then you will enjoy this one as the same wacky sense of humour endures. Like the television series, it's a pretty low-budget film, but the humour makes up for it. I would not call it a classic, but I would consider parts of this film to be funny while others go beyond 'funny' (or what I consider 'funny' to be.) I think that this one is slightly better than 'Life of Brian'. Anyway, see for yourself. You will either love this or hate it, depending on your sense of humour and how warped you are.",5,4,8,5 February 2006
Aladdin," Good story but could have less humor
","This Disney twist on the popular story of Aladdin is a decent job, although the humour elements (the genie) were a little bit annoying. (I find more and more in Disney films the presence of one or more absolutely annoying characters that just ruin the story; maybe these annoying characters are what children enjoy nowadays.) Excellent animation - let's hope they keep making 'flat' (traditional) animation as well as the 3D computer-generated pictures.Don't get me wrong, this is worth a watch. Really. I don't recommend it highly, but it is worth a watch if it is on the television. And, the animation is good too.",5,4,17,23 October 2005
Braveheart," Overrated
","Braveheart is an over-rated historical epic which is much over-rated. The film stars Mel Gibson, and the film seems to portray him in one of these idolised images of heroes that is so common in the majority of films he stars in. I don't know why the mainstream have embraced this film. Maybe they thought it sounded good to say that they had seen it and they enjoyed it. Maybe Gibson does excel in alluring mainstream people to the cinema to watch historical epics. Whatever it is, I had a lot of problems with this film. It is a typical Hollywood blockbuster, and maybe that is what the problem is. Too much action, a rushed story, and a long film that seems to lack in direction but uses cheap and tacky dialogue to bring Mel Gibson up to a hero status, particularly when he gives a moving and emotional speech about freedom. (I am sure that these words can be compared to other events, particularly in American history, and maybe these are more reasons why the film was so loved.) As a film, I had trouble sitting through it because it was not interesting, and I found several areas to be comical (unintentionally, I don't think the director wanted this to be a comical film). My verdict: over-rated and not recommended unless you like Mel Gibson or you disagree with this post.",2,6,13,13 November 2005
Gladiator," uninspiring story and characters, not saved by good cinematography
","The only good thing that I can say about this film is that it was shot well with careful planning in costume and excellent scenery. I cannot fault the picture/cinematography at all. But, this is the only thing the film has going for it, and this alone cannot save a film.'Gladiator' was over-rated as a classic epic of its time. The story is complex and very dull in many places, and it could have been shortened. Now, I am a big fan of historical fiction films, but this one just did not do it. The story was very weak, and I could not get into it at all. The characters were also another problem. I felt that I could not relate to them. The film is not as engaging - the characters and story are weak so much that none of the great things about this film make a difference. It is too bad because I had some high expectations for this film and the genre.",4,1,3,28 November 2005
Pocahontas," weak, inaccurate, dull
","This Disney version of the story of Pocahontas is meant to be entertaining and fluffy rather than a realistic historical perspective. This story is about Pocahontas and her relationship with a white settler in American history and about trying to prevent battles between the native Americans and the new settlers. This film leaves little to be desired with its cast of annoying characters and a story and romance that is difficult to really get into and appreciate. Instead of being a hero, it seemed as if Pocahontas was reduced more to a romantic love interest. Very weak film; the story of Pocahontas could have been done much better than this.",3,11,26,10 March 2006
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Spiritual with plenty of action to keep you on the edge of your seat
","'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is probably the most spiritual of the Indiana Jones films with plenty of action and adventure along with the magic. Indiana Jones teams up with his father to find the Holy Grail before the Nazis, and Indiana falls in love with a woman who is a spy for the enemy. The moments between Indiana and his father are emotional, and I would say that this film goes much more into depth about Indiana and his character than the other films do. As always, there are a lot of creative action sequences which will leave you on the edge of your seat. It is a fairly long film, but it's not a dull one, and it's got plenty of different types of action and chase scenes to maintain interest throughout. You won't be disappointed. I don't know of anyone who is disappointed after seeing this film.",8,1,1,31 December 2005
Back to the Future," One of the best
","This is the film that started it all. Back to the Future is an original film in which time travel meets comedy. The film is told well with plenty of jokes. One of the best things about it is that it makes science fiction look 'cool' and introduces that genre to a wider audience who previously thought that science fiction was all about geeks dressed up looking like Star Trek characters. There is a good blend of comedy and action, and the general public was able to appreciate it for the comedy and popular culture -- and for the 1950s jokes and characters that we can identify with. If you haven't seen it, this is a film that should not be missed. I am glad to see that it is still popular.",9,2,3,13 November 2005
Princess Mononoke," excellent animation
","This animated Japanese-style film follows a young boy through the forest to rid himself of a curse. The film is about Nature and humans and the gods of all things. The young boy tracks down Princess Mononoke to help him. The film is beautifully animated and enjoyable. It also has some good insights about the culture and showing the important balance (or imbalance) between humans and Nature. It has some good lessons to learn here. This is a film that can be enjoyed and sets itself above many of the other animations coming out these days. It's serious, yet it is refined; it does have a refined sense of humour in a couple of places. I recommend it.",8,10,16,3 February 2006
Jurassic Park," A BIG movie, but not one I enjoyed
","'Jurassic Park' took over the world with its killer dinosaurs. The film is about a group of people who get caught up in a theme park where the dinosaurs are brought back to life using their DNA. They revolt and kill a lot of people, and that is basically the whole plot of the film. It's a thriller with a lot of dinosaurs and special effects. If you enjoy thrillers and just want to see people getting wiped out by dinosaurs, then this is the film to see. As usual, its plot is really weak, and the characters are pretty two-dimensional. It was huge in its time, but it's a film that I never cared for at all. Don't expect anything other than a typical thriller.",3,3,21,1 January 2006
V for Vendetta," classic, creative, original
","'V For Vendetta' is a film set in the future where the world behaves strikingly similar to the film '1984' with a corrupt and controlling government and ruler placing bans on human freedoms. Among the chaos is a hero dressed symbolically as Guy Fawkes who wishes to bring down the government. In a chance of fate, he meets Evie, and her life changes while she is thrown into a series of events that pull her in his direction. The film is a masterpiece combining an engaging storyline, unique characters and character development, and detailed cinematography to capture the different moods and atmospheres of the oppressed society. This film also has a lot of symbolic meanings behind its concepts. In short, it is like a breath of fresh air that we've been waiting for in so long for a couple of years of disappointing films. Very well done.",8,0,1,30 August 2006
The Godfather," Has its moments, but not the best film
","'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.",5,10,25,30 November 2005
