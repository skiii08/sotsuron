Casino Royale," No gadgets,No Cars but pure entertainment
","Before turning up in movie hall I was memorizing the old movies of James bond specially acted by Pierce Brosnan and was expecting the same treatment for this movie but the movie was made apposite to mass expectation.The Introduction of new actor was a feel good factor for the movie.I must say the new actor justify the role of James Bond brand with his masculine but attractive physique and persona.His persona is such nice that he stands for both romantic hero and clever British agent. Although the movie was not having the regular punch of new technology but subtle in many scenes.One thing i liked very much is the way treatment of love story incorporated in the movie between James Bond and Eva Green, it was unusual for James Bond as his character is defined by flirting with girl and not involved in serious affair with actress.The treatment of James Bond was changed for th movie in many respect specially the excitement and energy of James was most focal point in the movie ,some time he was shown to have done the work with maximum risk which a normal James wont do The story line is also new and focused around casino related crime overall its a movie to watch a must watch for everybody",10,1,3,19 November 2006
