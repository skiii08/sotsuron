E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Still a great film
","I still think this is one of the best films and just because a few things were changed it doesn't bother me.  I only wish he decided to keep the guns in instead of being politically correct because it was so obvious they are not holding a walkie talkie.  However, it nonetheless receives my highest rating of a 10+.  Watch it regardless of the changes, it will be released in both formats on DVD so you have nothing to lose when they make it available to the public.",Null,0,0,13 April 2002
Minority Report," Brilliant!!!
","Another great film involving 1 of the best writers in science fiction with 1 of the best directors of our time and 1 of the best actors in Hollywood. This movie had everything you would expect for an adaptation of a Phillip K. Dick short story, especially the look of the film.  It was a lot like Bladerunner and Impostor, visually stunning, brilliantly directed, good casting, and very well put together.  It does make you wonder...if you could change the future would you?  A definite 10+ which, as you know, means its a must own.",Null,0,0,1 July 2002
Spider-Man 2," FANTASTIC!!!
","While I have always liked how these comic books are adapted into films, I really enjoyed the story in this one more than the comic book aspect of the film.  Roger Ebert said it best, 'This is a superhero movie for people who don't like superhero movies.'  There is so much depth to the characters and storytelling, especially the personal problems Peter Parker has to deal with.  I liked this movie just as much as the last one, and I recommend this at any price, which means I give it a 10+ on a scale of 1 to 10.  This is yet another movie I will definitely own.  I am very excited about the next movie and can't wait until it's released.",Null,0,0,2 July 2004
Finding Nemo," good...
","For an animation.  I usually don't care for these types of films because they only go so far before I lose interest.  This film was an exception. Pixar did a great job of keeping me interested.  They had a very good cast, especially Albert Brooks and Brad Garrett.  Hopefully Pixar will continue producing better movies as time goes by.  It would be nice to see another animation like this one come out.  Now that Pixar has left Disney, maybe they will have even more control over what they will do next.  Anybody interested in Finding Nemo 2?  If they have the right type of story, it would be fun to see a sequel of this made.  Assuming, of course,  they use the same cast again.",Null,0,1,3 March 2004
The Others," good ghost story
","I usually don't watch these types of films because I'm good at guessing what will happen next.  I will however say that I found this film to be quite good in the storytelling department.  Cleverly written, well acted, and a surprise ending that I will not reveal.  I have never been much of a fan of Nicole Kidman's films, but this particular 1 kept my attention to try and figure out what was happening.  The 'scare factor' was kept in the story and not in the amount of times they could shock you.  In any event this was much better than 'The Sixth Sense'.  I recommend this film highly and give it an 8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,7 July 2002
Troy," Exciting!!!
","Very good adaptation of the Iliad by Homer.  I was very impressed with the battle scenes and the cast.  It was funny how many of these actors already worked with each other in other films.  For example, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom were in Black Hawk Down, and Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom were in The Fellowship Of The Ring.  I couldn't help but notice how Orlando Bloom used a bow and arrow the exact same way as in LOTR.  My only complaint about the film was that some of the actors not mentioned above overacted way too much. That aside, the special effects were fantastic, and the direction was very good.  Go see it at any price, you won't be disappointed.  I give it a 7 out of 10.",Null,0,1,15 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Fun, but...
","It's hard to watch this without thinking of all the reasons things like this just couldn't happen.  (For more information, consult the goofs and trivia section and you will see what I am talking about.)  I enjoyed the special effects, the actors they chose, and the directing was just fine too.  My personal feeling was that after the movie was over it was just okay.  I wasn't depressed with any one thing, it just didn't impress me as much as say, Independence Day, which was by the same director and was a great movie as long as you didn't think about the plot.  I would strongly advise not to pay full price for this one.  I saw it for free and I'm glad I did.  I hope his next film is a little better than this one.  Oh, by the way, the girls were really cute.  I give this film a 5 out of 10.",Null,0,2,29 June 2004
Ocean's Twelve," Okay...
","This is not a bad film, just not a great film. The first was a lot better. There were only a few times I laughed out loud. I enjoyed the cast, except of course for Julia Roberts. If they bother making another movie, I hope they write a better script. If they worked on the story a bit more it probably would have been a better film. I was a little bothered that Bernie Mac and Carl Reiner didn't have bigger roles considering they were really good in the first movie. Considering the amount of talent in a movie like this, I would have hoped that this would have been a lot more fun than it was. If you're going to see this, make certain you don't pay full price. I give it a 5 out of 10.",5,0,0,31 December 2004
Scary Movie 2," funny but...
","As much as I appreciate comedies, this movie was a little too much in the sex department.  I was hoping for some more parodies rather than even more sex.  Any more and it should have been rated NC-17 or X.  As for the movie it had its moments, but it just wasn't all that great either.  I may have to watch it again to really say any more.  I did appreciate the cast, especially Chris Elliott, who is always funny, and Tori Spelling from Beverly Hills 90210 was great also, Kathleen Robertson also from 90210 was wonderfully cast as a temptress, and Tim Curry played a great part also. Overall this movie is worth watching but don't pay full price for it.  It's a much better movie at $5 NOT $7.  Also, don't go if you think there are too many people in the theater because all they will do is talk through it - a personal pet peeve of mine whether or not I like the movie.",Null,2,4,4 July 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF THE YEAR!!!!!
","Let me first say I will not reveal anything about the movie's plot.  I was so impressed with this particular episode I will definitely see it again. Some of the best action I've ever seen since Raiders of the Lost Ark, and some of the best special effects I've seen.  My favorite characters were Count Dooku and Obi-Wan Kenobi.  What a great performance by Christopher Lee and Ewan MacGregor!  This movie receives my highest score of 10+ - go see this movie at any price and when the DVD comes out, pick that up too!",Null,0,0,16 May 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," okay
","I'm not much for animation films but I have to say I enjoyed this film. The story was actually very good, especially about how monsters view kids and not the other way around as much.  As I said before I don't watch a lot of these films, however, I really enjoyed this one.",Null,0,1,15 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," AMAZING BEAUTIFUL FILM
","I have been waiting 20 years for this to be released and all I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE at any price.  It was absolutely the best film of the year and definitely worth the wait.  Even if you haven't read the books, you should still see it.  I just saw it opening day and I am already seeing it again tomorrow.  This movie gets my highest rating of a 10 plus, which means it is a must own when it comes out on dvd.  This will be a movie that will most certainly go up there with cinematic experiences like Star Wars.  So, how many times have you seen The Lord Of The Rings? I don't know, I stopped counting somewhere after the millionth time.  WATCH IT ASAP!!!!",10,0,0,19 December 2001
"I, Robot"," Okay...
","I was only somewhat impressed with this particular film.  I liked the special effects, the cast was good, the story was fine.  For some reason, I kept losing interest as it seemed to drag on and on about essentially nothing.  If it hadn't been for Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan, and Bruce Greenwood, (who always plays a good jerk), I probably wouldn't have cared as much.  Actors, by the way, are not my number one reason to watch a movie, it always comes down to the story first and foremost, and fortunately that was okay.  Since I wasn't really looking forward to this movie, it should come as no surprise that I only give it a 5 out of 10.  Whatever you do, don't pay full price for this one.",Null,0,0,19 July 2004
Van Helsing," Lots of fun...
","Although there were a number of flaws, which I won't talk about, I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.  First off, the special effects were great, the musical score was fantastic, and the acting was good.  The story was a little too much.  I think they should have saved some of those characters for other movies like they would with a superhero movie. For example, in Batman the only villain was the Joker.  Not most of the villains he faces.  I think they should have changed a few things about the actual character of Van Helsing, (his age, reputation, etc.), and perhaps the amount of time they would take between parts of the story.  I loved Kate Beckensale in this role, Hugh Jackman was a good choice for Van Helsing, and Richard Roxburg whom I haven't seen since Mission Impossible II was a good Dracula.  I give this movie a 7 out of 10.  Go see it at any price.",Null,0,1,10 May 2004
Spider-Man," WOW!!!
","I've been waiting for this film for roughly 20 years and it was well worth the wait.  Sam Raimi has done it again and really stayed true to the comic book.  There were enough special effects to rival Batman, and a great cast including a lot of people you would usually see in any Sam Raimi project. Hopefully we will see more classic villains like Jackal, and Doctor Octopus. See this movie at any price, it absolutely receives a 10+ and is a must own when it is released on DVD.",Null,0,0,3 May 2002
Collateral," Villains rule!!...
","and Tom Cruise really delivers.  Michael Mann has always been one of my favorite directors, so when I heard that Tom Cruise was teaming up with him I knew I had to see this one.  Honestly, it was hard to actually root for the good guys in this one, and I don't normally do that, it's just that the villain was actually intelligent instead of stupid.  Having been a fan of Heat, The Insider, and especially Manhunter, I was pretty sure what I was getting myself into.  I give this movie a 9 out of 10.  I don't know that I would own it when it comes out on DVD, but, I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Tom Cruise or especially Michael Mann.  A must see at any price!!!",Null,0,0,10 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Okay...
","I saw this movie and I still feel the same way about this one.  It's just way too 'Disney' for me.  That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the film, it just means I liked it as much as the other ones.  The kids are doing a great job as usual.  I also really enjoyed the actor they chose to play Dumbledore, even though he really didn't sound like him.  However, I still liked the way Richard Harris played him best.  I hope they decide to keep the same cast for the rest of the movies, but, if they do change certain actors, I understand that too.  I recommend this film for those who have already seen the rest.  I am looking forward to the next one coming out next year.  I give this one a 5 out of 10.",Null,0,0,19 June 2004
Ocean's Eleven," fun film
","I have been waiting for this movie for some time now, and except for Julia Roberts (thank God she isn't all over the film) it's a great movie.  Really funny, well acted (except of course for Julia Roberts) and a great script as well as cast (except for Julia Roberts).  Make sure you don't miss this film even if for some reason you happen to like Julia Roberts.  Don't ask me why. Definitely a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, and I'm not talking about Julia Roberts either.  Did I mention I don't like Julia Roberts?",Null,0,0,8 December 2001
Alien vs. Predator," Very cool...
","I was actually very pleased with this film, even though I basically knew what was going to happen without reading the comics.  That being said, I enjoyed every minute of it.  I also totally disagree with all of the anti-director speeches and the rating issue.  HE DID A GREAT JOB!!  GET OVER IT!!  I don't know why it would make ANY difference what the rating is, as long as the movie is good.  WHICH IT WAS!!  I was very impressed with the costumes in particular, as well as the cast.  The Predators and the Aliens looked great without the CGI being used for every last effect.  Having said that, I don't necessarily think I would own it, but I think it was a great film on its own.  I definitely recommend this movie at any price and give it a 9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,25 August 2004
K-19: The Widowmaker," Better than average...
","I was hoping this would be a little better than what I saw.  I liked the cast and the drama that built up, but I realized this was about a half hour too long for my taste.  That and too many obvious things happened, even if this was based on a true story.  Watch this movie, but don't pay full price. Good job by Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson.  I give it a 6 out of 10.",Null,0,0,22 July 2002
Men in Black II," Very good...
","Especially Frank The Pug.  Being a pug owner he was by far the best reason to see the movie, however, this was a very funny movie - I don't know about it being better than the 1st, but it is worth watching at any price. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones were no different than they were in the 1st movie. A definite 7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,3 July 2002
Shrek 2," Good movie...
","I just saw this before everyone else ruined it for me, and I'm glad.  This was a very good sequel.  When I heard they were going to make a sequel, my wife was more interested in it than I was, but, I have to admit it was worth watching.  For instance, I was glad they chose John Cleese to play the king. He has always been my favorite in the Monty Python clan.  Julie Andrews played the queen, which fit her like a glove.  Puss-In-Boots was played by Antonio Banderes, and he was by far the scene stealer.  Of course it was good to see Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers again.  I liked this about as much as I liked Finding Nemo.  Since I rate animations on a scale of 1 to 5 I give this movie a 3.",Null,0,0,19 May 2004
Mission: Impossible II," much better than the first
","This is what the first film should have been.  No conspiracy inside of a conspiracy multiplied by a million like the last one.  Very good story, some of the best action sequences ever, mostly thanks to John Woo and Tom Cruise. Also if you watch the DVD with all the extras you will understand why so many things that happened in the film are believable.  The only Mission:Impossible worth owning.",10,2,4,3 July 2001
Black Hawk Down," War is hell...
","And this film proves it.  I've never seen a war film quite like this, but it was the closest to anything resembling what I have heard from soldiers I have known.  The special effects were great, and the cast was good.  Hats off to Jerry Bruckheimer and Ridley Scott, 2 of my all time favorites in the business for a very accurate portrayal of 1 of the few failure missions in our nation's history.  Also, showing what happens when we fight someone else's war, no thanks to the Clinton administration the most corrupt administration this country has ever known.  I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone who likes war films or if you happen to be a fan of the cast or crew.  A perfect score of 10+.  This film is a must own.",Null,0,0,7 July 2002
From Hell," not bad
","This particular movie wasn't quite what I was hoping it would be.  For one thing, it too unnecessarily graphic, something I don't appreciate, however, I did appreciate the overall story they used, and the acting was good especially the chemistry between Johnny Depp and Heather Graham.  Go see it if your a fan of this type of movie, but don't see it if you have a weak stomach.",Null,0,2,15 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," okay but..
","I was not as thrilled as I thought I would be.  The very fact that this movie had a bigger take than The Phantom Menace made me believe this was going to be equally as entertaining, but it wasn't.  I had a hard time comparing it to E.T. because to me it seemed more like Disney than Steven Spielberg for the entertainment value.  Overall, I would recommend that you see a matinee showing rather than pay full price. I give it a 5 out of 10.",Null,0,0,17 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," okay...
","I have seen the first film and I feel the same about this one.  Not really a lot to it.  Just another movie to watch as far as I'm concerned.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't that great either.  I find myself saying the same thing about this movie that I said about the last.  It's just way too Disney for me.  I am not saying I am not looking forward to the next movie, because I am.  My feeling is the context of the film seems to drag on, and instead of being really excited of what might happen next, I find myself not being surprised at what happens at all.  I still like the overall look of the film, the actors are good, the direction and the special effects are good, but, I am only just okay with this whole genre of films.  I give it a 5 out of 10.  Maybe renting it would be an even better idea.",Null,1,2,19 April 2004
Vanilla Sky," good film
","If you are a fan of movies that have a lot of twists and turns, then this is the movie for you.  You will be surprised at a lot of what happens and what (thankfully) doesn't happen.  Whether you're a fan of Tom Cruise, or you just like mysteries, my advice is to see it at any price.  Definitely a 7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,15 December 2001
Hart's War," Hmmm...
","I didn't think the film was all that bad, however, I found myself wondering how many statements you could put in a movie, I was a little disappointed at the fact that I could basically predict what was going to happen. Overall, it gets a 5 out of 10, so don't pay full price to go see this one.",Null,0,1,27 February 2002
