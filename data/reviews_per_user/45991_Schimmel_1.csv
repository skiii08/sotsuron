The Ring," This movie has changed my views of how scary a movie can be.
","This 115 minutes long gutwrencher has changed my idea of how a movie can affect me. I've never felt so much that I not wanted to see some things again - for example the scene after the mother of the dead daugther says 'Rachel, I saw her face'.With cold, gothic-like, strong pictures of nature and weird scenarios this movie relies on mystery and psychology to make you shiver.It's simply genuinely and impressively horrifying. All scary movies and thrillers together honestly won't beat this movie in intenseness of experience. It has forever changed my views of how scared a movie can make me. Believe me, the movie isn't just 115 minutes. It's still on show in my head two days after I saw it.",10,1,1,20 March 2003
