United 93," what is the effect of this film on young Muslims?
","Well, this is my opinion, one amongst thousands. First, nobody knows what exactly happened on this plane. Some people here say it's a realistic movie... How the hell does anybody know???? And as it was proved with the black box, the story in this this movie is not true, we're not even even sure that passengers entered the cockpit. Secondly, there is a major risk in this movie: I saw this movie in the US. And during the scene where passengers kill the young terrorist, some people shouted and applauded. It scared me. And I'm sure if I had been among a Muslim audience, this wouldn't have happened. What would have? I don't know. But my problem is this one: in this movie, everyone is right and brave. The Muslims follow their path, praying, smiling, scared, like normal people. Moreover, one of the terrorists, the pilot, hesitates. The director tries to make us believe that this guy actually had regrets... Bullshit. Nobody knows. And the problem is that this movie shows a Muslim/Christian war, especially in the scene where everyone is praying. As if the terrorist where only following their religion's path. OK, this movie is not about religion, it's about a story that happened. But nobody knows HOW it happened, and everybody knows what were the consequences. How is this movie helping? This is supposed to be' dedicated to those who died'... Please... Stop this bullshit, this is dedicated to no one except the producer's bank account. And try to imagine what effect this movie could have on young Muslim's minds.",2,11,28,17 September 2006
