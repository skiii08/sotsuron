The Blair Witch Project," One of the worst movies I've seen.
","After watching 'The Blair Witch Project' on home video for the first time, two things occurred to me. First, this is one of the worst movies I've seen. Second, I'm extremely glad I waited for the video release instead of wasting $8.00 in a theater. It's not that the plot was not intriguing. I enjoy a truly scary movie and the 'Project' could have been. The main reason I disliked it was the overuse of the 'F' word by Heather. I don't mind profanity in a film, but she went a bit overboard and had me rooting for the 'Witch'.",1,0,2,27 October 1999
