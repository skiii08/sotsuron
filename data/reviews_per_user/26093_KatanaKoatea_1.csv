The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," It was better then expected
","OK so I don't normally write reviews but for this one I thought i would. Just to give everyone a heads up there might be spoilers in this review.So I have seen all the twilight movies that have come out so far and read books one to three. I could not read the last one because i found book two and three so boring and stupid. So I went into this movie just knowing the coles notes of what was going on. Now keep in mind I really did not want to see this movie but my friend convinced me to go saying if we seen the first three you can't stop when there is two left.I went in thinking this movie was going to be other crap and came out thinking, that was better then i expected it to be. I really thought this movie was going to drag on like the other ones before but it didn't feel that way expect maybe the part where they were going to cut it off for the next film. I knew when i was coming but for some reason they seemed to drag it on a bit. It kinda felt like they were just trying to fill the movie time. Do i believe that this book could have been done in one movie yes.So after the movie was done we were walking around the mall that we had just seen it and overheard two girls that were clearly twi-hard complaining hard core about much they hated it and now be warned here come some spoilers.They hated the part about the wolves fight scene with the cullens and how the wolves moved so fast that it didn't look so real. OK people you have to remember in CG, animation is made fast to cover any animated mistakes that could not be fixed. I thought it was pretty good CGI for what it was. Also keep in mind it summit entertainment twilight is there biggest grossing movie ever for this company.So i wont ruin anything else for this movie but if you go in with really low expectations then you come out thinking it was better then you thought. If you had really high expectations well then your screwed.",Null,7,11,23 November 2011
