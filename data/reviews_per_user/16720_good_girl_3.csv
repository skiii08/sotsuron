The Sound of Music," A true classic, in every sense of the word.
","I have watched this movie more than any other movie. It has been a personal favourite since I was 3 and I have never become sick of it. The movie is so charming, enjoyable and utterly watchable.Julie Andrews is divine in the role of the outspoken wannabe-nun, Maria, who becomes a governess for 7 children in a slightly dysfunctional household. She has one of the most beautiful singing voices you will ever hear and her singing appears utterly effortless. She is a lovely actress and has so much screen presence.Christopher Plummer is wonderful as the seemingly cruel (but actually just desperately sad and overwhelmed following the death of his wife) Captain who relearns how to love, laugh, appreciate his children and sing with the help of Maria. According to some reports, he hated making the film, but you would certainly not be able to tell - his performance is sincere and heartwarming.Each of the seven children is lovely and sweet. They are all capable singers, dancers and actors. It is great how they are so featured in the film, and don't just disappear when they are not 'important to the story' as happens in so many films! This is such a heartwarming, tender and compassionate story, based on the life of the Von Trapp family. I was thrilled to be able to go to the Sing-along-Sound-of-Music and see how many people - old, young and in between - are still enjoying the magic that Robert Weiss created so many years ago.Even if you do not like the idea of this film, or do not enjoy it, I believe that it is a film that should be seen by all. It is a piece of motion picture history. A true classic!",10,3,10,31 January 2009
Spice World," Better than I expected
",I went to see this film to mock the Spice Girls because I hated them. Soon in to the film I realised that they were mocking themselves so I just settled back and enjoyed it :)  It is funny and light with wonderful cameo appearances.  I now don't hate the Spice Girls and have bought the video. It's strange how things turn around....,8,1,2,26 July 2003
The Pianist," Hard to take but brilliant
","I found this film very powerful and thought it was brilliantly made, but I found it extremely difficult to sit through and would NEVER watch it again. I could hardly breathe!!!  I know it's not supposed to be a light film, but wow - some of the scenes were traumatic to watch.  I'm glad I saw it however.  I think that part of the horror of the film is that it is done in such a matter of fact way - people just get shot with no ceremony etc. exactly as it would have been in Hitler's reign.   This film really opened my eyes to some horrors that have conveniently been left out of school history lessons.**POSSIBLE SPOILER** Adrien Brody was brilliant beyond words.  I agree that the scene with the officer was a particularly moving one - I have tears in my eyes even now, just thinking about it.  It was so clear that he thought it was his last chance to play.  It was his farewell to the world really and his face was astonishing! *************I just can't understand how the man who Adrien Brody portrays every survived the experiences showed in the film.  BTW - it is based on an autobiography so the comments about things not being realistic or logical are a bit misplaced - maybe you should argue with the man who wrote his life story :)Anyway, see it if you can.  Don't go if you have something that needs to be done afterwards, because if you're anything like me you won't be functioning too well!",Null,0,1,7 May 2003
