Ghost," Whoopie Goldberg was the best thing in this film
","Whoopie Goldberg was the best thing in this film, overrated beyond belief when it came out, and overall fairly shallow although it has its moments. Demi Moore (she of the 'beautiful hair' - see 'Friends' where Phoebe cuts Monica's hair) seems to be trying an Audrey Hepburn impression taken from Breakfast at Tiffany's, which only serves to remind us of who is the better actress (Hepburn can act her socks off while still being cute and elfin, Demi Moore just looks cute and elfin). As for Swayze, it's the only thing I've ever seen him in, and likely to remain so, judging by this performance. The guy may be cute, if you like that sort of thing, but I found his acting so bad that at times I laughed out loud. To be honest, I thought he could give William Shatner a run for his money. It was left to Whoopie Goldberg to show us what real acting is like, and although her character did not have much variety or development to work with, she managed to steal the show. The film had some comic moments and was not a total waste of time, but touching it was not. Only bother if it's raining and you really have nothing else to do.",3,5,16,12 March 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Surprisingly good
","I was hoping that this would be good but somewhat dubious about it, but when i saw it i was relieved to discover that it actually was quite good. It stuck quite closely to the book, and when it deviated it did so in appropriate ways - none of the deviations seemed tacked on. I was impressed by the presentation of a particular icon of popular culture, who was presented in a way that harked back to how he was portrayed before commercialism got hold of him, and i wished he could become the new standard. The religious aspects of the film were neither under- nor overstated, and it worked fine on the level of an adventure film and as an allegory. I was very emotionally involved, partly because of having read the books as a child until they fell to bits, and i was actually moved to tears once. It was also so much better than the BBC TV version, and in that i'm talking about acting rather than special effects or scenery. However, the special effects did make me think that when they finally do 'His Dark Materials' in cinematic form, it will be able to do justice to those books too.If they do decide to do the other books, i would certainly go to see them as well, and they would have the advantage of having good writing to back it up.The only problem was that the climax of the film was too drawn out.I'm amazed Disney could do a children's film that was actually good.",9,1,2,11 December 2005
