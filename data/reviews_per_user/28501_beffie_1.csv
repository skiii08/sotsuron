The Ring," scared the living cr@p out of me...
","i normally don't get creeped out by 'cerebral scary' films as most aren't intelligent enough to lift a hair. i always leave the theatre disgusted as the film is dumbed down to the point where any sort of redeeming qualities are overshadowed. 'Signs' anyone? can you say 'spoon-fed ending?' on the other hand, 'The Ring' made my skin crawl. every hair on my body is standing up. i want a warm bath. i want a cup of hot chocolate. i want my mommy. then, i'm renting the original.",Null,0,0,21 October 2002
