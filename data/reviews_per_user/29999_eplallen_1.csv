Requiem for a Dream," Materful
","One of the most inspiring and authentic pieces of film I have ever had the privilege of seeing.Original close-ups , great pace and rhythm , excellent score , as well as capturing the viewer and emmersing him/her withing the world of hardship that exists in life ie drug abuse , survival,....Mr Aronofsky is by far one of the most influential Directors of all time in my opinion taking film to another exciting level.",10,1,1,16 October 2017
