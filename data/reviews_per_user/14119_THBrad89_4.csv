The Equalizer," A very good movie
",Great movie until the last 10 minutes - DW further solidifies himself as one of the all time great actors - if ending was more plausible I would have rated it a 10. Fist fight in store would not have happened and Robert couldn't just hang out in the diner after these events. But even with a weak ending it was very good - looking forward to the sequel.,8,0,2,29 July 2018
The Hangover," Hilarious
",The best comedy in a decade - keeps getting funnier with each watch.,10,2,2,14 May 2019
The Conjuring 2," Almost Too Scary
",Watch this alone in the dark - if you dare. Grabs you and the beginning and keeps your adrenaline going the entire movie - almost too intense.,10,0,1,30 January 2018
Days of Thunder," A goof
",When the Brain Dr (NK) and Trickle (TC) are riding 'in NC' you can see a Barnett Bank sign. Barnett Bank was only in FL and GA - not NC.,Null,0,0,25 June 2020
