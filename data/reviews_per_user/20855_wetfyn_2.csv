Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jim Henson Lives!!!
","I'm sorry, but those trailers they had on the Internet were not reflective of the movie I saw last night.  I can't wait for Episode II - 'Muppets in Space'.  C'mon George (or Jim, or whatever your name is) give us a break. Why did you do away with the same seedy characters that we loved so much from the bar scene in IV.  Now those aliens were a bunch of vigilante, mercenary, cut-throat killers that had an irreplaceable 3D physical presence about them.  They were real, they were coolÂ… The alien characters in Episode I are horribly juvenile, even the 'bad' guys are annoyingly simple(with the exception of Darth Maul, who in my opinion single handedly saved this movie). Please George, don't make us baby-sit these aliens in Episodes II & III",Null,0,1,20 May 1999
The Matrix," Are the Bill& Ted days finally over? Maybe...
","Wow! I can't believe how many notable original aspects there are in this movie:**A first class shoot'em up Karate chopin' action movie with a plot!**Keanu in a roll that not only didn't completely ruin the movie, but may have actually been the most perfectly cast actor for the part**Computer aided animation & effects that didn't force you to constantly observe 'suspended disbelief'**Excessive close-ups of the the female lead's backlit facial hair, and she was still beyond sexy!!!",Null,0,0,1 April 1999
