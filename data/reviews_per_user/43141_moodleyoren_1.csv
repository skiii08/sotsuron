Blade Runner 2049," Slow and Boring
","One of the worst movies I have seen in a while. I fell asleep a hour and a half in. Watching this movie was literally torture. Makes me wonder how it got the 8.7 on IMDb.The plot of the movie flows very very slowly. Action scenes are short, rare and poorly executed. The story is boring and not engaging. Spoiler Alert The only plus I see from the movie is seeing what an old Batista would look like in the first scene.",3,9,21,6 October 2017
