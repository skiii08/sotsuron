It," Best horror film of 2017
","I loved this film. Not because I love and read the book, but because it was amazing in adapting IT. The book and the movie are very similar and noble to the book. And what pushed it even more was the best child actors in movie history. But I have to warn you the movie is mostly entertaining and less scary. But don't worry it is still scary, especially Bill Skarsg√•rd who portrayed Pennywise wonderfully. I give this movie a 9/10!",9,1,3,12 October 2017
Jaws," This movie that will keep you out of the sea!
","This is one of Steven Spielberg's best movies. It is fun, scary, and true of originality(when it came out). The only problem I have is some scenes take bit too long, but not enough from me liking it. Most scenes are super entertaining and strongly written. In conclusion this movie is a fantastic summer movie, a must watch! I give it a 9/10.",9,0,1,6 October 2017
