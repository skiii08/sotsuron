Lucky Number Slevin," Everything except the one thing
","*spoiler alert*!!! Wow, this IS an amazing movie to say the least. Under-rated in my opinion. I won't go on and on about the plot, since there are plenty of other people doing that. But, I will say this, this movie plot was flawless, except for Lucy Liu's part. I know it's just a movie, but give me a break, the guy sleeps with her once, not 48 hours passes and he lets her in on the whole plan. Trust doesn't come with sex, as is commonly believed. And for someone to plan throughout their entire life a vengeance on everyone and more involved in their parent's killing, and then divulge everything because of a little roll in the sack seems a complete lack of focus. It makes the lead character seem not as bright and as driven as the rest of the film would have us believe. And, actually, Lucy's role could have been done away with all together and not have it affect the film one bit. Don't get me wrong, she is a good actress and a very sexy woman. But her character just took away from the film's bite. Especially at the end. I might have believed it, if Bruce Willis had acted more of a empathetic father-like figure, but the fact that he didn't, makes Lucy's part seem all the more confusing to me at least.",9,0,2,2 September 2006
The Machinist," Absolutely brilliant
","It is amazing this movie didn't win an Academy Award. I have never seen any movie like it before, nor after. Christian Bale, although one of my favorite actors since American Psycho, clinched my top spot with this one. His physical transformation will never be matched, and his acting is flawless. Both thought provoking and horrifying at the same time, it is a movie centered around guilt, decisions, and revelation. Full of symbolism, every scene is worthy of deep analysis - leaving you wanting to watch it again and again (just not so soon, due to its depth). My hat is off to the director, actors, and accomplished crew for making a movie so worth watching.",10,13,22,28 July 2006
No Country for Old Men," No Country for Very Much Anymore
","I have to say that this movie was intriguing, full of surprises and more violent than I expected. And although I suppose I understand the intentions of the plot, as convoluted as it was, I am kind of disheartened that it won so many academy awards. It's not just that it was full of errors (check the goof section), nor is it that in my own humble unprofessional opinion that although Javier Bardem was great, I saw no acting that was worth the award - I just don't think the role was written well enough to support it. But most of all, I really don't know what to make of anything anymore when a film of such overwhelming violence is put on such a coveted pedestal. Yes, I am aware that there have been other violent movies that have won, and maybe it is just the sad revelation that as I get older, what we see as entertainment - strike that - what we see as THE BEST of entertainment, is still nothing more than useless violence that carries with it no repercussions for the guilty. The film industry rarely gives us what we need, but feeds us over the top with what we shouldn't have; glorifying theft, betrayal, greed, and as we see in our latest best picture, murder. Maybe I'm just getting older, I don't know. Personally I can handle the violence and all the other garbage, but I also believe the more graphic and blatant our so called entertainment becomes, the less value it must have. But as I said, this is just my unprofessional opinion, so I'll end this 'review/rant' with this; if you are in the mood for a story full of death, some of it implied, some of it right there for you to enjoy - and if you are itching for a movie with no happy or justifiable ending, leaving you feeling like you went on a ride that was supposed to be the best ever but was really just sitting in your car parked in your garage with the motor running, then by all means...Enjoy!",6,8,16,16 March 2008
Pulp Fiction," Just a point or two about the greatest trend setter ever
","Well, instead of going on and on about Pulp Fiction, I want to add just 3 small points that I found more intriguing and absent from any discussions I've seen as of yet. Oddly, they all have to do with the Mr. Wolfe episode... 1. Something that had caught my attention from the first time I saw the movie is that Mr. Wolfe is called early in the morning at a house (or hotel room) that seems to be in the midst of a black tie party! An all-niter I would presume. Not to mention that he takes the call not on a cell phone as most of the other characters do, but on a corded phone in the bedroom! Kinda odd. 2. I had submitted this as trivia, and I hope I am right. But when Jimmie is talking to Mr. Wolfe in his bedroom, Wolfe says to call him 'Winston'. But when Vince and Jules thank him outside of Monster Joe's, he tells them to 'call me Bruce'. If I am wrong in this, I've got issues I need to work out because that's what I've heard every time I see it. Anyway... 3. I don't know if it was meant as a joke of sorts, but when we are introduced to Monster Joe's 'daughter' (?) Raquel, it seems like they had just turned around as we see some huge lurch of a guy walk in the opposite direction carrying either a crowbar or some other tool/murder weapon. I mean, that guy is huge and I've always assumed that was Monster Joe, seeing he was the size of a monster. I know that someone completely different was supposed to be Joe, but those scenes were deleted so I almost suspect that it was put in as a sort of implication, or another Quentin 'easter egg'. Check it out, you'll see what I mean.Please reply to this if anything I said was wrong....This is just one of those movies where you see something new every time it is shown.",10,0,1,3 May 2006
Paths of Glory," simply put.
","Everyone else will tell you about the story over and over again. So I won't need to do that. But, what description I'll give is one in its most simplistic form. One that summarizes the overall feeling, because to put into words such emotion for each scene is not possible. You will understand what I mean once you see this masterpiece of heartache. For it is just as impossible to put into words the emotions of any soldier during wartime. I should point out that I saw this movie on an old B/W set and give my review from this standpoint. To me it was seeing this movie minus the color that really maked it stand out. What makes it timeless. Anyway, to give you a feel for this movie here is one simple sentence. Black and white, and red throughout.",9,1,1,9 July 2006
