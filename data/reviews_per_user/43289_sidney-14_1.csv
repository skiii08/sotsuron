The Blair Witch Project," seeing it cold
","Reading the other comments showed how much seeing this film could be affected by the publicity it has obviously received. The film isn't out yet in England and I saw it in Paris today with only a vague idea of what it was about. What I saw was a pretty grim look at three American kids utterly unprepared for an encounter with evil. The point to make is that the film was not trying to scare me; it was trying to show in a very convincing way what it is like to be scared, cold, hungry and lost. It has always been the rarest thing for a film to show people not coping and falling apart; films don't like to admit that we are not always in control of our lives. Although a completely different kind of film it reminded me of 'The Dream Life of Angels' from France last year; the same wintry light and the same barely glimpsed death at the end. Go and see it but leave all of your expectations outside.",Null,1,2,25 August 1999
