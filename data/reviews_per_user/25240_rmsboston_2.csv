50 First Dates," A Movie That Always Touches My Heart
","I might be a little bias, because I've seen this movie so many times. Regardless, this movie always lifts my spirits. Not only is it funny, but it has just the right amount of romance to pull at your heart string without ripping it out. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are the perfect on screen couple. Their chemistry seems so real. Not to mention they both just look so darn cute next to each other.I'd recommend this movie to anyone.",10,13,15,26 June 2018
Velvet Goldmine," Underrated Film
","I really loved this film. I think that it is really underrated. Every character had their own story that you could see through the plot. The outfits were very cool and enchanting. The music is actually one of my favorite things about this movie.The only thing I did not like about this film was the back and forth to the past and future. It seemed a little too out of place sometimes. I would of rather just watched what happened in the 70s then at the end it jumps to the future where we find out Arthur is doing an article on Brian Slade and what happened to him. Something like that, something that wasn't so back and forth.",8,1,2,26 June 2018
