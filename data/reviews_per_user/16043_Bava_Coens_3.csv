The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project...
","This is a story of how our minds lead us to react when we are lost...we focus on the negative, and let it eat us up...it seems as if the 'blair witch' was a figment of their imaginations...something to blame their fear, lonliness, and confusion on:  and once the end approached, it was found that their imaginations were at truth, and that with fear lives the supernatural.",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
The Big Lebowski," dude made me laugh
","i liked the camera shots in the bowling alley...i liked all the repetition of vulgarity...i liked the comedy, and the coens famous actors buscemi, goodman, etc...the big lebowski is funny as hell, little action, and great simplistic dialogue.",Null,0,1,16 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Definately went out with a bang
","Eyes Wide Shut reminded me alot of lynch, scorcesse, and kubrick combined...especially the orgie scene...it was very cool...the orgie scene completely made this movie what it is....without all of the masks...i just wouldnt have thought this movie was credible.  I loved the cinematography, especially  the scenes of Cruise strolling the new york streets at midnight. I dont quite understand what Cruise was trying to accomplish by attempting to sleep with these sleazy people, was he trying to get back at kidman for having that fantasy of the naval officer???   if it was a cheap attempt to get back at her...i think he took things too far...i mean a prostitute...an orgie???  how can you compare a fantasy to a real life situation...i mean cruise never actually had intercourse with any of these people, but it wasnt because he didnt want to...personally...i liked the fact that kidman told her husband her secret fantasy of the naval officer...if she told him that in attempt to make him jealous...she really succeeded(seeing how every 15 min.cruise had horrid thoughts of the whole ordeal, i mean it seemed like he was more worried about her fantasizing about the naval officer then kidman actually going on with the act of fantasizing...overall, i really enjoyed the film....clockwork is still top on my list of kubrick films.",Null,0,0,27 July 1999
