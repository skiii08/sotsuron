Walk the Line," best movie I've seen this year
","I was surprised that Juaqin Phoenix pulled it off. It was painful to watch the early attempts in the recording studio. Vivian was believable as a first wife who you know has to get left behind even though she gets all of the material things she thinks she wants. Reese Whitherspoon mastered country singing and accent. It is particularly galling to watch people who aren't country try to speak country and only speak stupid thinking it makes them sound country. It only makes them sound stupid. The movie was well cast and well executed. This should get Oscars for male and female leads. Well Done. Jim Copp Hampstead, NC",10,1,3,19 November 2005
