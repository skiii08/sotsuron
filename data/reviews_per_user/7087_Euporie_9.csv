The Lobster," Imposition of extremely rigid rules is always a bad idea...
","Everyone interprets this film in their own way. The film itself is not particularly funny or entertaining, but it still kept me engaged and got me thinking. My interpretation is that human beings should just let one another be. As shown in the film, whether in the 'couples world' or in the 'singles world', there is no utopia. One has to have a sense of conscience, be non-judgmental and just let one another be. Be kind to less fortunate beings and animals too.Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz and the rest of the cast was wonderful. I would have rated this film higher if not for the disappointing ending.",7,0,3,24 April 2018
Hereditary," Watch the trailer - you won't get any more from the film unless you read some online analysis
","First of all, even after the film being A-rated and cinemas checking our id cards before entry, in the version shown in our cinema, they had CUT some essential scenes - like Charlie cutting the pigeon's head (it's in the trailer)! Who knows what else they cut for censor reasons! Ok now onto the film itself - not sure what it is - wannabe cult psychological-supernatural-ritualistic-thriller-mystery-isshhh?
I don't know what the professional critics saw but this definitely does not qualify as a scary movie at all (unless you count the scary omissions in script). The audience felt listless, bored and everyone laughed out loud several times during the second half.Why wasn't anything made clear - after all cinema is a visual medium. It feels like a film made from a 500-page book where it is a pre-requisite to have read the book in order to follow the film. Only problem- there is NO book. Doesn't at all feel like a original film script. Basic filmmaking - A film must provide ATLEAST enough visuals for the audience to draw their own conclusions - you can't just have a mish-mash of weird and creepy scenes and expect everyone to call it a masterpiece! 
And why make Annie narrate when you could have dedicated a few scenes to what her mother was up to? Also, they should have given more screen time to Charlie.Not many complaints wrt acting, esp from the principal cast:
Alex Wolff - If they want to nominate someone for Oscars from this film, they should nominate this guy, not Toni Collette. Excellent nuanced performance, extremely convincing in scenes where he is grief-stricken, panicked, traumatised or plain horrified. His face is a reflection of million emotions going on in his mind in one particular scene. If you have seen the film, you know the exact scene I am talking about.
Milly Shapiro - Another brilliant performance. She was totally convincing in every scene she was in. 
Gabriel Byrne - Fine perfomance as the husband/father who has clearly had enough but is kind and generous enough to keep going on...
Toni Collette - Overacts a bit in some scenes especially since she knew some of the history of her mother. I am happy to see the director not resorting to jump scares in a film like this but not much else to appreciate overall.",2,2,4,23 June 2018
Tangled," Wonderful version of Rapunzel!
","This is so funny, there are so many laugh out loud moments - I loved it. The songs are excellent with wonderful singers singing them. Excellent casting choices. This a revisionist version of Rapunzel but not in a way one would expect. I found this film to be a perfect blend of fantasy and reality. Charming, to say the least. And most importantly it is HILARIOUS! Flynn will go down as one of the funniest Disney characters ever.",9,1,1,21 July 2018
Silver Linings Playbook," Bradley Cooper is brilliant and the film is quite entertaining
","Maybe this is a biased review and the film itself does not deserve 8 stars but what the heck, Bradley Cooper deserves all those stars for such a nuanced and wonderful performance! I always thought of him as this hot dude from that overrated Hangover movie or the cool guy who did a lot of fancy walking in American Hustle, but in this film he is simply amazing! He gives an incredibly believable and controlled performance as the guy suffering from bipolar disorder who is trying to get better. Added bonus-he can dance too! Wow!
Jennifer Lawrence is kinda refreshing. I usually hate De Niro in anything other than in mafia movies but he wasn't bad either. The only bad casting choice was the therapist who was not at all convincing. Best part is they kept the story to the central characters and their motivations rather than making it about circumstances. The characters in this film never play the victim card and are constantly trying to improve their lives. The other good thing about the film is that it never got too sentimental or preachy. It stayed light and entertaining throughout.",8,2,3,1 August 2018
Pride & Prejudice," Very bad adaptation
","The acting here is collectively very very bad. I do not know whether to blame the director or ALL the actors for this. Matthew Macfadyen (Mr.Darcy) is the absolute worst in this.
The script is terribly dodgy. It feels like 100 people worked on the script because the structure and dialogue is somewhat bearable in some places but incredibly terrible in others. Undeserved Oscar nominations all round.",1,3,8,6 February 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Emma Watson is a terrible terrible choice for Belle; enchanted objects casting is great though!
","They got the casting of the leads absolutely wrong. I remember Belle from the 1991 cartoon film being lively and cheerful and she had a sweet, calming voice. Emma Watson on the other hand, is still channeling her 'angry Hermione'. She maintains a scornful look and tone throughout the entire film. Also, she cannot sing in tune, her singing voice is worse than her speaking voice and the auto-tuning makes it totally disastrous. 
Listen to 'Days in the Sun' - Young Beast's (a 10-12 yr old boy) voice is indistinguishable from Belle's voice! For a long time, I thought it was Belle singing the opening of that song and later found out it was a young boy singing only when someone put up the lyrics with singers' names!As for the Beast, they should have just had a guy in a suit. Also, did they digitally magnify Dan's voice to get that booming effect? Pathetic!I would have rated this film much lower if not for the incredibly well cast enchanted objects. All of them have wonderful voices and they can sing as well. I particularly loved Audra McDonald and Emma Thompson's rendition of the title song. 'Be our Guest' was also very nicely done for my taste (I am not judging the French accent as I do not have a good ear for it).",5,0,0,24 April 2018
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Terrible beyond belief
","Caught this on Netflix the other day and donno what audiences at the time felt, but in 2018 this feels pathetic. Watching Gary Oldman in the first scene, I thought this was definitely a parody and then when I heard Keanu Reeves, was sure this was gonna be a hoot. Nope. Not even close. It is also not dark or intriguing.
Looks like the actors signed on to work with the famed director and paid no attention to the script and totally hammed it up in whatever horrible accents they could do.A large part of the blame must go to the adapter of the novel - you cannot just throw in your own fantasies and gratuitous sexual content (like writhing women in silk Ã  la Ghostbusters only with loads of women whose tops are off, beasts in disgusting acts). Adding explicit sexual content or meaningless 'layers' to characters that are not in the original (like making Dracula some sort of hot bad boy that women are attracted to), you are only cheapening the source material, not making it contemporary. When you add something to existing source material, it should be in tone with the rest of the content, respect the characters for what they are and also be in tune with the time period. In this film, Dracula is reduced to a poor confusing joke and Mina - what is really going on with her? Don't even get me started on Van Helsing.With a runtime of 2+ hours, it is way too long for this borefest but still seems like everything was rushed. For a big studio film, couldn't they atleast spend some money on getting the blood right?",1,6,11,8 July 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Not Agatha Christie's Poirot but something atrocious - zero stars
","Poirot in this film is Romeo, James Bond, some sort of social activist all combined into one:) Everyone knows him and adores him! Physically, he looks nothing like Poirot described in the books. He is not egg-shaped, he has an atrocity of a colour-changing moustache which is not even stuck properly and he also sports some dead-cockroach like goatee. Grossed out yet? 
The writer definitely had no clue of Poirot's character or his traits and his writing is not even good enough for a high school play.So, Kenneth Branagh just went along with all this as long as he got to be in every scene and mouth long monologues(?) After all, he being the director, protagonist, producer etc. surely had some say in character development? I read a lot of reviews reviewing Kenneth Branagh instead of the film, and I don't blame them at all. It is really hard to tell if he deviated so much from the character to glorify himself or Poirot...Sure looks like Branagh wasting his talent by vying for some non-existent glory instead of playing the character for what it is. He totally sidelined all other characters - why cast Judi Dench when all you can give her is 2 lines? He just seemed pleased to have everyone gushing over Poirot at a glance and act like some superhuman figure! He also keeps laughing annoyingly while reading his book.I definitely do not have an ear for accents, let alone Belgian ones, but even I could tell that this was an accent very badly done. I mean I took A-Level French and in one of the very first lessons, they teach you that 's' is never pronounced at the end of words like 'oeufs'. Did anyone pay any attention on set??? 
Also can't understand why they had to cheapen every single character, including Poirot?! All the actors, especially Tom Bateman (Bouc) mouth dialogues like they are reading lines off of a placard. Can't blame them - sample this cheesy dialogue from the character Bouc - 'He (Poirot) never judges me for being a terrible person!' Okay whatever...but I am judging! There were so many such 'gems' that after a while, I just stopped listening to the dialogue and zoned out completely. Seasoned actors are made to perform scenes like this - Michelle Pfeiffer flirts cheesily with Johnny Depp and he sniffs her and then leaves with a disgusted look! Ewwww...And that three holy men thing at the beginning - I don't even...'Murder on the Orient Express' is not a good mystery as such. Even while reading the book, I could guess the ending much much before the reveal and was bored with multiple chapters of Poirot's questioning. I think they keep remaking it as they can cast a wide variety of well-known actors and keep making money off of their starriness. 
Since everyone is comparing this film to the 1974 version, here is my take on that. I am not a fan of Albert Finney's Poirot either (yes yes, Oscar nominated and all!). He had a grating voice that was like nails on a chalkboard. He yelled and yelled and then yelled some more in his thick, incomprehensible accent. However, he did not glamorize Poirot or try to change him into what he was not and the other characters had much more to do in that version. Only thing that works for Branagh over Finney is that he has a pleasant voice, so you can sleep through his monologues.If you haven't already, do watch the David Suchet version. It is very very good and much shorter. Suchet also nailed Poirot perfectly.PS: 1. The song that Michelle Pfeiffer sings at the end seems like it was written for Poirot's long lost love (the woman whose pic he keeps with him), so maybe he should have sung it and made some more mockery of the character:)
2. Now they are remaking 'Death On the Nile'...Why? Wasn't this one bad enough? Someone else should try making more interesting Poirot novels like 'Lord Edgware Dies' or 'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'.",1,13,21,26 June 2018
Sully," Brace for impact!
","Very well done! The film is just like the real Sully himself (who always says he was just doing his job) - no fuss, no melodrama, no glorification of the man but just plain story telling that is absolutely entertaining. The film covers the actual events of Hudson landing, and then the aftermath of it all for Sully's career as a pilot and his reputation. The visuals and sound effects that take you through the events in the plane culminating in a Hudson landing are extraordinary. You really feel like you need to brace for impact! And this is while watching on Netflix. Must have been an amazing experience in the theatre. Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart are perfect in their roles. Rest of the cast did a great job too. Wonder how this film wasn't popular in the awards circuit. I mean here is an amazingly well told story of a remarkable man who did not panic under tremendous pressure, calmly made an excellent split second decision and saved so many lives and the Academy found nothing good in it? Cannot understand how they overlooked Clint Eastwood, Tom Hanks and the film itself.",9,3,3,19 July 2018
