Skyfall," Best Bond
","Casino Royal set the tone and this continues how brilliant the Bond series is. FACT
Fans will love this movie but also someone that may have never seen a bond movie.
Acting is super from all and cinematography is what we all pay to see.
Negative response is from negative people.
My favorite Bond since live and let die.
Soundtrack kicks ass and so does the film",9,0,2,27 January 2019
Deadpool 2," Pure Class
","The first was great and this sequel will keep you more than entertained.
Great continued storytelling with introduction of awesome characters.
If you are an X-men comics fan you'll dig it even further.
I hope they do a THIRD and not let Disney stink it.",8,1,1,28 April 2019
Bird Box," A really good watch
","A solid cast, a good film and more importantly a a no brainer.
Clearly you would know what to expect from a film like this.
Any of the negative reviews would be expecting a 28 days later, no chance it's more of a slicker invasion of the body snatchers.
Only negative report is that that it didn't need to be as long as it was.",8,1,4,22 December 2018
Baby Driver," GTA for winners
","Loved this.
Sound track was awesome followed with some great storytelling.
What you heard is what you'll dig, Jamie fox is top class.
If you don't like this it's your loss. Loved it and hope there's a follow up.",8,0,1,7 April 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," With great stories you get great movies.
","What an amazing surprise, I already cannot wait to see it again.
There was a high number of laughs, soundtrack is top class and the mad number of story lines happening makes it completely stand out.
I really cannot express how much I loved this movie. It's Hollywood so they'll try do another but I am not sure they'll ever top that now.",9,0,1,19 March 2019
Sing Street," Take on me..
","I've watched SingStreet a number of times.. As someone who likes 80s flicks and 80s tunes this is what nostalgia is all about.
A story that not makes you think that what is life without a little risk in tough times but how important it is to be yourself ( a little cheesy) great acting throughout with nice good laugh at so many Irishism's throughout.
Sing street is a classic. Check it out. I know you'll dig it.",9,1,1,24 February 2019
