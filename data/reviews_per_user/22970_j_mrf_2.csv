Requiem for a Dream," Killer Performances by Ellen Burstyn...Darren Aronofsky: Stanley Kubrik has called for you to pull up a chair!
","Oh my, where shall I begin? Experimental film making bursts into mainstream in this dramatic tail of 4 people who find themselves spiraling down the abyss, after experiencing a rendez-vous with the inevitable consequences attributed to drug use and the ill effect it has on its addicts. This one has no happy ending. There's no sugar coating here. Albeit this film packs a harsh, blunt, and sometimes overwhelmingly genuine depiction of the havoc drug addiction can reap on its victims. Despite the disturbing message of the film, I never the less couldn't help but remain fascinated with it's experimental/avant-guard visual style: A smooth, elaborate and languid progression of cinematic eye candy orchestrated to almost resemble a shockumentary, complemented by an impressive and well composed soundtrack. Some of the visual techniques were similar to the ones Aronofsky used in his directorial debut 'Pi', such as split-screen shots and the use of body cameras filmed at varying speeds. At times, the film seemed more like an acid trip than a feature film. A cry for help is clearly felt throughout the film, from its innocent and promising start, to its hauntingly chilling conclusion. The one scene that really blew me away was the scene where Marion (played by Jennifer Connelley) had just sold her body off for a bag of heroin...As she walks out the door of the apartment, along the corridor, into the elevator, down to the street: one can't help but feel the characters disgust with herself, filthy to the core, what it must feel like at...'ZERO'. The acting performances, especially by both Ellyn Burstyn and Marlon Wayans are simply breakthrough performances that earned critical acclaim across the board. Enough said. If this review alone does not compel you to experience the Film, I will just have to spell it out: PLEASE EXPERIENCE THIS FILM - it may cause an uneasy stomach, but is well worth it - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! 11 out of 10.",10,298,384,27 August 2001
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Stellar Performance by J.M. Cameron
","Let down by mediocre film adaptations of Theater Musicals? Well, then Hedwig will surely change your mind about the genre. From the costumes and makeup to it's overly-dramatized portrayal of dreams gone bad, this film delivers entertainment at it's best. A stylish production entrenched in Glam Rock roots, this film obviously pays tribute and homage to David Bowie, and all gender-bending pioneers so closely linked to early punk and rock. The cinematographic artwork, animation, and direction flawlessly accentuate Hedwig's wit, music and melodrama.Cameron's performance is stellar and I must admit that they make him look quite attractive as a woman. This is not your 'run of the mill' drag queen flick: Priscilla, Queen of the Desert...move over!",10,0,2,17 August 2001
