Ford v Ferrari," Time Warp
","Overall, it's an entertaining story for those who know little of the actual timeline of events but the full story would have taken a six hour movie to be accurate. So they've taken a decade-plus series of events and compressed them into a one year tale that's filled with excitement and drama.For 60's racing fans, and antique car buffs in general, there is plenty of eye candy that should satisfy, although I'm sure many of the race cars shown are most likely CGI; it's hard to tell anymore.",8,1,2,16 November 2019
Midway," Felt like a Reader's Digest Condensed Book story
","Aspired to be an equal to 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' or 'Battle of Britain' but fell far short. Will soon be forgotten. Nice CGI, though, but since it was extensively used maybe the contributions of the B-17's, PBY's, TBD's, F4F's, F2A's, TBF's, B-26's and SB2U's could have been shown more fully. The SBD was far from the only type that took part.",4,0,3,24 November 2019
Green Book," The best I've seen this year.
","I really can't add to the superlatives given by others here. This is simply the best movie that I've seen this year. I've given it a ten star review but would really like to have reduced that by half a star because of the inclusion of one scene (YMCA), the subject of that wasn't hinted at before, and wasn't expounded on after. Was Don gay? Who cares and what purpose in the movie was served by the suggestion that he was?I will add the half star back by giving a shout out to David Tinsley who supplied the movie's cars. Period correct, with minor exceptions, and lending an air of authenticity to the film.One minor point that was not explained was what happened to the rest of the trio after their final gig? Did they stay in the south or did they make it home (wherever that was) by Christmas. They did play a minor roll in the story but still, I hate loose ends.",10,22,43,14 December 2018
