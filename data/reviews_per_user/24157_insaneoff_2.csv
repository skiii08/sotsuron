Your Name.," I don't cry with anything but this...
","Can you fall in love with someone you've never met?
For stories as exciting and full of feeling as this is that I really appreciate Japanese animation. It takes us to the story of two strangers with completely different lives who are destined to find themselves following the already known Legend of the Red Thread with the only drawback that without prior notice, both change their bodies, which forces them to live in each other's personal lives and they can not remember the other's name and their threads are intertwined with time. I was left with my mouth open with its animation so polished, with the warm landscapes and how real the characters feel. Without falling short, explore this concept passionately, as Miyazaki Movies has us so accustomed. I have cried, I have smiled and I have learned that true love waits. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie and try not to be filled with tears like I did.",9,0,0,20 February 2019
Grave of the Fireflies," War is not a game..
","I have always been afraid of war. See all the people that I love being murdered for no reason, just political. When war, violence and blood flood the lives of children, they have to become adults faster and take care of their loved ones. This is what our protagonist Seita, takes with himself to the grave. The film treats you as a spectator of a reality, not as a simple film. The reality of war in the eyes of the children. The reality of the people who suffer it and give their last breath to survive. This film by itself is a masterpiece, but its ending ... well just remember everything I cried with this and the words I wrote here are useless. This is one of those films that changes the perspective of things in your life and makes you remember that maybe, this world would be better without the violent human beings that we are.",10,3,3,21 February 2019
