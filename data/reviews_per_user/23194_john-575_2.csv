The Hangover," Unfunny, lame and weak
","I'd seen 'I Love you man' the previous week and had hoped for something equally funny and enjoyable.Sadly The Hangover is weak, lame, unfunny, poorly cast and really just a total waste of time. Personally I'd wait until it's a weekly hire DVD and then be suspect.How it got to be #130 on the IMDb Top 250 really makes me reconsider using IMDb ratings as a guide to movie-going. And question any newspaper critics who give it even faint praise.The fact we have to write a minimum 10 lines about this here is a further travesty of justice!",1,26,54,28 June 2009
The Wrestler," In a word... depressing
","I was looking forward to the Wrestler...the week before we tried to see it but the session time was misprinted in the paper so we switched to Slumdog Millionaire. The gods were smiling that day.Yesterday we meant to see a preview of 'Grand Torino' but that was running half an hour late so we opted for the Wrestler which started 3/4 hr earlier. The gods it seems with the value of hindsight were not smiling yesterday.Honestly I thought I'd enjoy this movie.. true I do prefer happy endings. But the combination of self mutilation, the downward spiral in the Wrestlers life was all a bit too much. I was hoping once he got the job in the supermarket he'd get himself into a regular life and stay retired.. but sadly no.Mickey Rourke cuts a fine figure of a man in the movie. Marisa Tomei does as well with a very hot bod. But ultimately New Jersey, trailer parks and the Wrestlers depressing life style were not for me.With the value of hindsight I wished we'd left the theatre after the first 30 mins and gone to the one showing Gran Torino.I think the comeback of Mickey Rourke and this movie in general have been over-hyped. To see it already well into the top 250 here... what can they be thinking? Basically the story here is just DEPRESSING.",3,13,30,18 January 2009
