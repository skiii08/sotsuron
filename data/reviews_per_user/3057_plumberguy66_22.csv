The Ring," Whoa... ease up
","I really kind of liked this movie. No, it wasn't a heart-stopping, jumpy movie but there is no arguing that it is a well made, skin-crawly, creepy, atmospheric movie. I am the type of person that can enjoy both kinds of movies equally well and I do. Some of the scenes in the Ring are straight out of a nightmare and others are shown so briefly, you're not sure what you just saw - which only helps circulate the creepy atmosphere. I've read some of the reviews on here and have to say that I don't understand why some people take offense at remakes of foreign films. Granted, I usually like the original version as well but I can't possibly keep up with every foreign title. Or perhaps I'm just a lazy American but, sometimes it's difficult trying to get into the feel of a movie with having to read subtitles. Also can't watch dubbed movies, that's just plain silly. But if the remake is done well, what's the problem. I've seen both and thought them equally well made. In a way I am grateful to the people that bring some of these foreign films to the US mainstream. I may never have become aware of this, and other wonderful titles were it not for their Americanized cousins. Movies like Ringu and even Abre los ojos (Vanilla Sky) might still be unknown to me otherwise. That would be just sad. Cheers!",Null,2,4,13 March 2003
Minority Report," Minority Report card: I give it a big A
","This must be SS's apology for A.I. He seems back in his game again with Minority Report.  I found this movie very entertaining. It was fast paced and had a great cast and great special effects. But that was not the bulk of the movie. The great story is what really made this movie work. There are some great CGI scenes but they are needed to carry the story along. They are not gratuitous like in The Mummy Returns. Most of the special effects are scenes that were seen in the trailers. I especially liked how the futuristic gadgets were handled  as if they are part of everyday life: like the internet is to us today.The acting here was very good. As I've said before, I am not a big Tom Cruise fan. I think that may be changing. He has been scoring points with me ever since Jerry Maguire. I think he does a really good job here under Mr. Spielberg's direction. I will ask though, if, Mr. Cruise feels like he's being typecast as the man in the mask'? If you look at his last few roles, he's been playing a face-dancer for the majority of them: Eyes Wide Shut  he's in a mask for almost a ¼ of the movie, both MI's and a third one on the way will surely have him changing face again. Vanilla Sky had him in a mask or some prosthetic make-up for half the movie or morebut I digress. Suffice to say he worked well in this role. I should also mention Colin Farrell as Detective Ed Witwer: He did a superb job as far as I'm concerned. He really made you hate that character (I think the gum chewing helped it that respect). Samantha Morton was great and Max was, as always, Max.I usually don't outline the plot of movies on here and I'm still not going to, I think you get the gist by now. I will say that the plot is a little predictable in places, but the story is still very engaging. I've read a few reviews that mentioned a bleak, dark and even 'Godless'(?), soulless world that was created with MR. I say: If you've read anything at all about this movie, you should know by now that it is based on a short story by Phillip K. Dick. This is the same man who wrote the books that were the basis for Bladerunner and Total Recall. What kind of world did you expect here? If you've read or have seen either of the two afore mentioned titles then you should know he doesn't create a bright shining vision of the future. However, Mr. Spielberg seems to lighten it up a bit. There are parts where you can totally feel Mr. Spielberg's presence but surprisingly (and refreshingly) there are many instances were you totally forget that you are watching a SS movie (I can only guess that's because he didn't write it). So, perhaps some people should do a little research before seeing a movie, especially individuals who have access to the abundance of information as on this very website. Then, maybe, they wouldn't expect so much. Jeez, it is only a movie after all.All in all I found this movie very enjoyable and worth every penny spent to see it. I feel really good about Mr. Spielberg's directing abilities again. He had me a little worried there for a while. That's my take. What's yours?",Null,0,0,10 July 2002
Unbreakable," Right up my alley
","Another winner from M.Night Shaymalan. I love movies with twist endings and this one certainly blind-sided me. Unlike the end of the Sixth Sense, (which I figured out. Ok, just moments before it was revealed) Unbreakable's ending was a complete surprise for me. I loved the Sixth Sense but in that you were purposely distracted from the true nature of Bruce Willis' character. Not so much here. In this Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, the soul survivor of a passenger train accident. In fact he's not hurt at all, not so much as a scratch. Why? Through a cryptic note left on David's car, `when was the last time you where sick?' These and other questions arise. From here David starts a journey that will lead him to the answers he seeks and beyond. You as the viewer move along the same lines and make the same discoveries as David. You are not diverted from the main goal of finding the answers you seek. What feels like a movie about personal enlightenment, which it mainly is, turns also into something wonderfully unexpected. To me this was Samuel L. Jackson's best role since Pulp Fiction. Bruce Willis is as good as ever. The kid was ok but a bit annoying at times and Robin Wright was not in it enough. That aside, I think this film was brilliantly done. Some of the people I've spoken with about this movie felt suckered. They felt that the end was a let down and not consistent with the rest of the story. In my opinion it reached its intended destination I just didn't realize it until it had. If you like movies like Vanilla Sky, or if you liked the part in The Empire Strikes Back when Darth Vader reveals that he is Luke's father then you may like this one. That's my take.

Fight Club," Woo Hoo!
","Thank goodness for Fight Club. This movie showed me that all movies don't have to be straight drama, straight comedy, straight anything. They can make fun of themselves. They can be wacky, intense and violent. They can play with the surreal and the unreal. The can be hip and innovative and all around good. From the very first frame I was reeled in. The story and characters are so great in this movie. They are played and directed so well. I really could relate to them uh oh. Then I find out what's really going on and I think I should check myself into the mental ward. Woo Hoo!  What a rush! I made all my friends see this movie. Then I bought it.Mr. Fincher, put down the Madonna videos and step away from the Alien sequels. You have found your niche!I urge every reviewer: please, please do not give away the end. That's my take. What's yours?",Null,0,1,20 March 2002
Monster," Look beyond the surface...
","I feel like I am one of very few people that went to see this movie for the story and performances. I've read so many reviews about the makeup effects in this film that I'm beginning to suspect that that was the main motivation for a lot of people to see this flick. In some of the reviews the opinion of this movie seems to hinge fully on the distraction the makeup caused for them. Now, I've had some issues with the poor use of makeup effects in movies also; Spy Game comes to mind. But, the problem I had with that was the lack of effects used. They never aged the actors in that film which made it unbelievable, not unwatchable and certainly not so distracting as to make it a bad film. I liked Spy Game. I just wanted it to be a little more believable. But this review is supposed to be about Monster and is turning out to be more of a commentary on the people that had a problem taking their eyes and minds off the way the two lead actresses looked.   The film is based on the killer Aileen Wuornos, as I'm sure you're aware. Though I think it's a stretch, she's touted as a serial killer and may very well be the first woman classified as such. That alone makes this an intriguing story. This is the story of a very misguided (or perhaps that would be better stated as unguided), delusional, dangerous woman, who, after years of hard living that leads to occurrences of brutality, snaps and begins a life of killing. Along with that, there is a story of desperate love and hopeless denial.   The performances are nothing less than exceptional; of course most of the kudos go to Charlize Theron. The make up effects help, but she really has become this woman. I have seen TV programs on this case with footage of Aileen and Charlize Theron has simply embodied her.   Another reviewer made a remark that she (Theron) watched footage of Aileen Wuornos and simply copied her mannerisms, voice and look. Hmm, wasn't that her job? And I doubt it was that simple or easy. I have to rely on these trained professionals to try and develop their craft enough to convince me that they are someone else. Mrs. Theron did this for me with out flaw.  I urge people to go see this movie only if they are interested in the story and/or film in general. If you go just to see a beautiful woman look ugly for a film then you'll most likely miss the great performances and messages this film conveys. And that's sad.   I really don't have the words, or time, to deliver all the feelings this movie brought up in me. I like to believe I got the messages and nuances of this picture and hope that others get it' too. Look beyond the surface. That's my take, what's yours?",Null,0,0,26 January 2004
Dawn of the Dead," WOW! That's all I can say
","Ok there's more..In the thick soup of seventies remakes one stands out above the rest. Dawn of the Dead. Not only is this movie far superior to the original but it is IMHO, The BEST zombie/post apocalyptic/horror movie I have ever seen. True, and I've seen a lot. I'll warn you if spoilers are coming.  The opening of Dawn of the Dead is quite intense and brutal gouts of blood, people running and screaming, zombies (of course) doing their thing and then the credits start to run and you just know you are in for one hell of a ride. I swear, I got goose bumps in anticipation of things to come. Dawn of the Dead works on so many levels I can't cover them all but suffice to say that it manages to be brutal and terrifying while injecting splashes of poignancy and gentleness. Sarah Polly has led me down the rabbit-hole before with movies like GO and No Such Thing; she takes us (willing) on a new, nightmarish ride and delivers the goods as usual. I think she is one of the best, most beautiful actresses today. For me, being familiar with, and liking, her past work made it easy for me to like/care for her character right from the get-go. This helped tremendously with getting sucked into the atmosphere. You can tell all the actors really got into making this picture. It must have been great fun. Ving is as great as always. But the real kudos have to go to the director and cinematography While the premise is disturbing enough and the actors veterans, I'm not sure it would have been as effective without the, up-in-your-face, shaky camera work. A lot of the film is shot in close, claustrophobic intimacy and then there are these shaky, off-focus, chaotic shots that put right in the think of the fight and violence, then wide panoramic shots that show you the full scope of this desperate situation. Some parts of this movie are nothing less than brilliant. I love true artistry in film and it delivers that as well. Great special effects, smart story elements, attention to detail (listen to the mall Muzak  perfect) simply a great movie going experience. I will accept no arguments on this.  Perfect 10.",10,0,1,1 April 2004
Billy Elliot," Can you feel it?
","Billy Elliott is one of those movies that you watch to pick you up when you're feeling down. What a pleasure it was watching this movie even though it's not set during the best of times for these characters. We come in as they are struggling to confront a recent death and overwhelming poverty all the while trying to retain some sense of dignity. Here we have young Billy living in a coal-mining town in Northern England with his father, brother and grandmother. His mother has recently died and his father and brother are on strike from the mines. Billy is in charge of looking after his grandmother, who is losing her mind while the others are at the picket lines. Billy is also is at that sexually awkward, adolescent stage. Times are tough to say the least. As Billy struggles to deal with all that is going on in his life he discovers he has a natural talent to dance. Urged on by the local ballet instructor (played wonderfully by Julie Walters), Billy faces the disapproval from his family for his love of dancing.When I first read about the story line for this movie I literally rolled my eyes. I thought, `oh boy, one of those predictable feel good movies'. And while it is a feel good movie, it was not as predictable as I thought it would be. And it was getting such great reviews from the critics and my friends alike, I took a chance. I'm glad I did.The cast really shines in this one, especially Jamie Bell. What a breath of fresh air he is to the field of young actors today. He really is a great talent.Bottom line: If you like movies with likeable characters sat in a nice mix of comedy and drama with just a dash of inspiration then this one might be for you. Easily one of my favorite movies. The soundtrack is great also. That's my take. What's yours?",Null,0,0,20 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," I think digression is the word your looking for.
","My oh my, what have we got here? (some spoilers among the ramblings)  I thought this was gonna be the one'. You know the Episode that knocks my socks off Well I'm still wearin' my Wilson over-the-calf crews I was rather disappointed in this installment of the series. I think I may be in a vast minority here but I actually liked Ep.I better. There seemed to be a lot more going on story-wise. You could see an arch building to reach Ep. IV. I thought it was very interesting. All except for (again casting myself into the minority) the pod-race scene: it held no excitement for me. We know that Anakin is going to grow up to be Darth Vader so where's the threat of him dying in a pod-race? But we're here to talk about Ep. II, aren't we? Well I know my 2cents is coming in a little late, but I had to get this off my chest(**spoilers ahead**)deep breath, here goes. I'm not lacking in the appreciation of a good romance, but enough with the forbidden love stuff already we know they get together. get it over with and get on with the story. Get on with Anakin becoming the Dark Lord of the Sith. We only have one more Episode left, don't waste it! You could be explaining so much, like who the Sith are and why we should be afraid of them. Instead we get sexual tension. Ok, but we know they get together! We could be seeing the clone war and where that leads us or the construction of the Death Star or even more (spoilers) Yoda kickin some serious butt. But no, we get the young lovers rolling around in the grass for Pete's sake! What about Shmi? That whole part was so unfulfilling. Like, Hi, Mom' uchhh dead. Then, oh then, we only HEAR about what he did at the Tuskin Raider camp! I mean jeez, get on with the meat of the story. The battle between good and evil.  We KNOW THEY GET TOGETHER! But I digress or have digressed enough for one day. Hey, there were some good moments, right? (And I stress moments). Like, there were a couple tense scenes where you just knew this was when Anakin was gonna loose that hand!. And then there were the jokes like, Anakin is going to be the death of me.' That was good.. and of courseYoda. All hail Master Yoda! Yeah. So, in summary: as I think I've illustrated here, I believe too much time was spent on a plot line that held no suspense or mystery and a digression from one that began this whole ADVENTURE. Was this much time spent on Han and Leia's courtship in Empire, which still remains the best installment in the Star Wars saga for me? I think not.  But I'm beginning to digress again.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Blasphemy!
","What a great movie! The acting was top notch, the special effects were better than anything my imagination could have ever come up with and the sets were fantastic. Don't get me wrong, the special effects and sets aren't what make the movie but they are a strong influence on the overall scope of the picture. The cinematography was breath taking. I never saw such a wondrous place while reading the novels (which I loved) and I never felt the depth of emotion that the movie brought to the characters. That in my opinion is what really makes the movie. In many ways the movie was better than my memory of the book. Some may say that is down right blasphemy but that's just my humble opinion. Now that I have seen Middle Earth in this way I am going to re-read the novels and perhaps see them in a different light. The one and only thing I found disappointing in Fellowship of the Ring is the knowledge that I have to wait a whole year for the sequel. I have to admit that I was a little wary about the movie when I learned that Peter Jackson, the same guy that brought Bad Taste to the world, was directing but he has made one of the best movies I have ever seen. My hat goes off to him for having the vision and imagination that I obviously lack and for bringing this enchanting world into being. I have seen many, many movies, science fiction and fantasy are at the top of my favorites and Lord of the Rings now takes the place at the top of that list. Go see and then go see it again.

The Matrix Revolutions," And to think I nearly missed this on the big screen.
","If I had heeded the advice of the first wave of idiots that said how bad this movie sucked I might have missed this very satisfying movie experience. I'm not really sure what some (if not most) of the people that disliked this movie were expecting, but it surely did p**s them off. I mean this was way, way, way better that those Star Wars prequels (I don't think I'll ever get over that disappointment). Perhaps a lot of people didn't understand these Matrix sequels. maybe they were too deep. That's really sad 'cause they aren't that hard to reach. I'll admit that I need someone to help me through a David Lynch movie now and then but come on. this is not like a psych exam without any prep. Yes, there is some philosophical babble here but it's just requires a little thought. Mostly there is a whole lot of hard hitting action that is completely satisfying. Also, I wouldn't call this the last installment of this franchise. There is more than enough room for a whole new series of Matrix movies. I say 'bring 'em on.' And if you whiny little dullards need someone to explain it all to you 'cause you didn't 'get it'; there's a message board on the subject going 24/7. check it.

"I, Robot"," Better than I expected....
","The trailers for this film do it an injustice. While I am not a big Will Smith fan I have really enjoyed some of his films especially the MIB films. On the flip-side, I have found him extremely annoying in others like Independence Day. From the trailers for I, Robot, it really looked a lot like the character from I.D. had been rehashed. I am happy to report that the film and the Spooner character were not nearly as bad as I had anticipated. In fact, I quite enjoyed the film.  I am not really all that familiar with Azimov's work so I had no expectations on that front. I did try to read I, Robot years ago but found it so boring that I couldn't finish it. My interest in this film was to see how action and special effects improved on what little of the story I read. I got more than I had hoped for.   I, Robot had all the action, good special effects and stuff that you would expect from a summer sci-fi film but it also has an intriguing and interesting story. Add those with decent acting and solid direction and you get a pretty enjoyable film. My advice, forget the trailers and ask someone that's seen it. I am confident that most will enjoy the film. It's simply a fun, popcorn munching, escapist, summer flick.",Null,0,0,26 July 2004
American Beauty," Feelings, nothing more than feelings
","One of my favorite scenes is when Annette Bening throws open the doors and proclaims, `I will sell this house today!' This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I have no problem watching this movie time and time again. I don't think I need to examine the plot. I'm quite sure by now there are enough observations in that area to choke an elephant. Suffice to say that this movie moved me in a way that very few pictures have done in the past. I found it a tragic and, at the same time, wonderful slice of life that I could relate to. That may seem like a scary statement given some of the themes in this movie. I simply mean that the characters are flawed and imperfect, as we all are, which helps me relate to them. Some of the issues that they grapple with are issues that we see in our own lives or in the lives people we know. That makes the story all the more human to me. I felt so sorry for Lester and Carolyn especially when they are on the (it's just a couch) couch and Carolyn spoils the moment by commenting about the beer. How sad. Yes, this movie made me feel for these characters.  It was so wonderfully written and directed. And I really enjoyed the way the movie was shot. The cinematography was simply great.

Mulholland Drive," Lots of spoilers! Perhaps an answer or two also.
","Lord knows I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed and I sometimes don't think before I say or do something stupid but I too have an angle on this film It may be way off, but then, so is this picture. Some thoughts and lots of spoilers: Have you noticed that when we go to sleep we sometimes carry some of the residue of the day into our dreams with us? Just bits and pieces, usually. A little bit of everyday `reality' swept in that gets skewed and twisted in the fugue of sleep. Add to that a healthy dose of despair, and guilt and you could be on one hell of a trip. That, I think, is what we have here in the film Mulholland Drive. We start with the perspective of one climbing into bed and falling into a pillow here the dream, and the skewed reality begins. Diane, now Betty, hits L.A. straight off the jitterbug circuit where she's just won a dance contest which has prompted her to try her hand at acting (makes since, right? Jitterbug contest winner = great actress pre-req). Sounds like something straight out of a silly old fifties movie right? Coincidentally, as you find out later in the film, Diane in an extra on the set of a movie set in the fifties.
  In Diane's dream, Betty hasn't got a care in the world. Everyone is so nice to her and her situation couldn't be more perfect; Her aunt is conveniently away and has left Betty her fantastic apartment. The aunt has also got Hollywood connections and has arranged for Betty to go in for an audition, her first ever, and of course, they love her (with all her jitterbug experience how could she fail?). She's just perfect for the part. She's not had to suffer the pain of rejection. Rejection and failure, those elements seem to me major players in this picture and missing thus far in the film. It seems it's at this point that reality first tries to creep into her dream. The pain of not getting a part in reality is glossed over in the dream by some strange characters making the director cast some unwanted for the part. We are also now taken on some side venues that, to me, are just remnants of the real world that Diane has drug into her dream but are, in the end, inconsequential. Now comes the unavoidable part Rita (Camilla in the real world), Diane's love interest. There's no way around casting her in the dream. She's been Diane's focus for far too long for that.  In this role, Rita is the beautiful, sole survivor of a horrible car accident who conveniently has amnesia so she can be anyone Betty's mind needs her to be, except for the person she really is, of course. Here, Rita is dependent on Betty, she needs Betty. Just the way Diane would love to have been needed by Rita.   In the real world Diane is all messed up. She wants to live the Hollywood dream but, the reality is that she's not a star and probably never will be. She's infatuated with a woman, Camilla,  who is a star but is no longer interested in Diane. Her obsession's new romance with the director of the film that both women are working on is rubbed in Diane's face and she snaps. Have you ever noticed how that when something bad is going to happen, something you were dreading but powerless to stop, it seems to occur with agonizing slowness when it does finally happen? The point where the director announces the impending nuptials between himself and Diane's intended, plays just like the eponymous scenario. During this scene we see the cowboy walk by who will be pulled into the dreams later simply because of his presence during this powerful turn/crack in Diane's mind. Diane goes off the deep end and hires someone to kill Camilla. The agony of loosing Camilla and the guilt of having her killed is too much for Diane. She sleeps all day, trying to escape the reality. For the brief time we do see her in the real world is when she is awakened by her neighbor, collecting some things left behind after the two swapped apartments. Diane is in her robe, hair a mess looking like she's been in bed for days. (Anyone who has been or knows someone that's been depressed, knows this is probably the case). The neighbor informs Diane that some detectives came looking for her again. Undoubtedly investigating Rita's disappearance/death. One of the last times we see Diane, is her standing in her kitchen thinking back on the things that led to this point. To the point where guilt and despair cause her to take her own life. The next time we see her in reality is when the demons have come home and she has to shut them out for good    As far as the homeless guy in the back of Winkie's goes (note the name denotes sleep: catch a few winks  Winkie's, Ok maybe not) to me he could represent the dirty little secret in the back of Diane's mind. She did, after all, hire someone to kill Rita. The blue box might represent Diane's life; she has the key but never opens it herself. Once it is opened by Rita, we see that it is empty. Rita is the one that holds it in her hands and opens it up. In the end though, it's dropped by Rita and we see them no more. As far as the old couple that could be the finger of accusation. The innocent and honest seem to magnify guilt and shame just by their very existence. To me the strangest thing in this movie is the aunt walking into the room after Rita drops the box as though she heard it drop. Did she feel a disturbance in the force? Did she somehow feel Diane's life pass. We don't even know if she really is Diane's aunt or just another inane character having been dragged into Diane's dream. Whatever the case, this movie will keep you guessing and asking questions long after it's viewed. In my opinion this is one of Lynch's best.

The Matrix Reloaded," Don't believe what they say. They're Agents!
","After reading some of the reviews on here, I'm beginning to believe that the Matrix is real. Who else but Agents would turn you off of this movie. We must be getting too close to the truth. That, or perhaps some of these reviewers are not true Matrix fans I don't understand what the real problem is that some of these people are having with this movie... Yes there are clichés here and there and perhaps there is a scene or two that is a little lengthy but in the end, you know what? This movie rocked. Some of the over-long' scenes were some of the best ones, i.e.; Neo fighting the Smiths, the freeway scene and especially the opening scene with Trinity. The choreography in those scenes was fantastic. We all saw the first one and maybe got a little desensitized to the special effects so, you throw in a little more story and some scenes of sensuality (which always makes most people a little uncomfortable anyway) and people complain... whatever! I, for one, thought the movie was great and well worth seeing. I even loved the rock video, shake the cave scene. What can I say, I'm part of the MTVgen...

A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Mind = A Beautiful Movie
","Ok, call me a late bloomer, but I hate paying good money for bad cinema, so I wait and I rent a lot of the time. The first mistake I made in missing this movie for so long was: I listened to my friends'. The second was: I thought, how interesting could a mathematician's life be?' Well I was wrong to listen and wrong to think. This was one of the most beautiful movies I have seen in a long time. I compare it to October Sky. If anyone tells you this was an, OK' or boring movie, then I don't think they saw the same picture. The cinematography alone was award winning, in my book. Russell Crowe is pure excellence  this should have won him his best actor award not Gladiator. I thought Jennifer Connelly was captivating. She has grown up to be a great actress. Ron Howard really deserved his best director award for this one. I could even forgive him for The Grinch after this. Also, I didn't see Clint anywhere. Hummm? Some of my friends, that didn't care for the movie, found the way his mental illness was presented was unfair to them, as the viewer. They felt cheated  and that, I believe, is exactly what the filmmakers wanted you to feel: the unfairness of the situation. The way this film presents dealing with a schizophrenic mind was compassionate and crafty. This movie puts the viewer in the driver's seat of the disturbed mind and then has you deal with the situation. This is a wonderful movie and I would recommend it to anyone. I would strongly recommend it to people that really love excellence in cinema. That's my take. What's yours?",Null,0,1,11 July 2002
Psycho," Two cents
","I know a lot of comments have been offered up for this movie but seeing as this is my favorite movie of all time, I figured I need to toss my two cents is as well. In my opinion this is movie perfection. From the beginning you know that Marion is (for 1960) a rather unscrupulous woman, but you like her. Albeit a poor decision-maker, she's strong and courageous.  You follow her along through her folly, wondering, `Will she get away with it?' Will she come to her senses?' And when she finally does with the help of poor, lovable, goofy Norman, the whole thing takes a twist that you could never have seen coming from a movie made back then. The cinematography is excellence, I have yet to see it's like again. The remake made a great attempt but it just didn't feel the same. The performances are as pure as Ivory soap.  This is the one movie that I can sit through time and again and it only makes me love it more. The man was a genius and obviously at the top of his craft here. That's my take.

Vanilla Sky," My humble opinion...
","First: I would like to thank the filmmakers for making Vanilla Sky. Until I heard about Vanilla Sky I had never heard of the film Abre los Ojosm or Alejandro Amenabar.Second: To correct some of these reviewers, Alejandro IS given writing credit for this film and who cares if Penelope Cruz reprised the role for the American version. If she was the right person for the first one, then why not cast her for this version?Now that being said. I had gone to the theatre in order to see Gosford Park but it was sold out and the only thing showing at the same time was Vanilla Sky. Since it has been out for some weeks, I figured the theatre would not be packed so I went for it. I had heard very mixed reviews about this movie and didn't know anyone (who's opinion I can trust) who had seen it. I am not a big Tom Cruise fan and had a bit of reluctance. I liked Cameron Crowe's past work but some of the reviewers claimed that this was not a style of movie that he should be handling. Well I have to say I'm happy Gosford Park was sold out. I think Mr. Crowe did a great job and even Mr. Cruise didn't get on my nerves. In fact the only other movie I actually liked Tom Cruise in was Jerry Maguire . go figure. I guess they just work well together.In all honesty I knew going in that this film dealt with dreams and not knowing what's real or not, so on and so forth. So, I opened my mind and just took it all in. From the first minute I was hooked. I was completely sucked into this intriguing story and then sideswiped by the surprise ending. Ah, the ending (no spoilers) it left me with butterflies in my stomach. What a frightening prospect.  I obviously didn't see it coming, but on hindsight (and for some of you VS bashers out there), there is a mild hint/reference to the ending at the beginning of the film. The visuals in this film are wonderful. I loved the Times Square scene. The performances are great. I especially enjoyed Cameron Diaz as the one-hell-of-a frightening, 'I'm about to loose it, you can see it in my eyes' spooky-girl portrayal. I hadn't seen Penelope Cruz in much else but I thought she was great. Jason Lee was Jason Lee. I didn't even know the Kurt Russell was in the movie until I saw him on the screen. A delightful surprise and a nice performance.Ok, so why all this bashing of Vanilla Sky by the fans of Abre los Ojosm anyway? If one is to believe some of the reviewers, this is a COPY of Abre los Ojosm. So, does that mean in order to have an interesting tale told to us we must speak a foreign language or read subtitles and miss the visuals? I hope not. There would be a lot of disappointed people out their if that where true. I applaud people that have the courage to translate movies, as well as books into versions that suite the audiences watching or reading them. I can think of one work in particular that scores of people's lives would be very different if the original had not been redone in a different language. One version is the King James.I urge everyone to form his or her own opinion of course. But I think about the fact that I almost missed this one by listening to the jaded opinions of what seem to be rather narrow-minded people.Oh! One last thought. I've read some reviews that compare Vanilla Sky to The Game and that's too bad. The Game, while it kept you wondering what was really going on, was in the end an insulting let down. I.e. Michael Douglas' character was being shot at with blanks. blanks that tore everything to pieces and left holes in everything. huh? And just how did they know he was going to jump from that side of the building????  Vanilla Sky wraps everything up pretty neatly. Some say conveniently. I think the end was well-done and very thought provoking. That's just my humble opinion.",Null,0,0,22 January 2002
Signs," Childhood fears from an adult perspective...
","As a child did you ever spend time in a wooded area or in the country near some fruit groves or near a grain crop say, like corn? And during that time did you and your friends try to scare each other with stories about what could be lurking there, just feet from the safety of the front door? Did you play the what if' game? `What if you woke up one day and there where circles impressed in the corn field? What if you started hearing things rustling behind the stalks? What if you started hearing things that go bump in the night. What if, what if, what if' As a child the game could go on forever it seemed. And as the stories grew and the night got darker, your imagination started playing tricks on you. Sometimes you could actually hear those bumps and rustles and feel the eyes staring at you through the leaves but just out of reach of your circle of light. Now, what if it wasn't your imagination. What if it was real? That seems to be the starting point for M. Night Shyamalan's latest venture. It seems at some point he started playing what if' and then took it a step further. This movie seemed to play on near primal fears at times. There are scenes in the movie that are straight out my childhood; being of the generation that grew up with Chariots of the Gods' and The Legend of Boggy Creek'. There is one scene that emulates that famous footage of Big Foot so well that it creeped me out to the core. I'm sure by now the premise of this picture has been outlined very well. I will just say that the stories are one: about a possible alien encounter and two: the questioning of one man's faith. Sounds like a bit of a paradox, huh? For most people the thought of aliens from other planets alone would put a question to their faith. But in this treatment we have it as a possible restoration of one's faith.  The movie starts right away with the discovery of the crop circles in the field and from their keeps adding fuel to the fire of imagination. It keeps winding-up like the string on a top and then rips the cord and lets it spin away. This movie builds tension slowly and then throws in just enough bumps and jolts to keep you riveted
To me the intent of this movie is to, of course, entertain but also provoke questions. Questions about fear, loss and courage, family and forgiveness but most of all faith. In one segment the question is asked, what kind of person are you?' One that believes in miracles and has faith that everything will be ok or one that believes that there is no one out there, that we are all on our own. It suggests that the kind of person we perceive ourselves to be could be questioned under certain circumstances and that we may be better, stronger people than we thought in the end. Strong performances by all but Abigail Breslin stole the show for me. I especially liked how the children where not condecended to but given respect by the adults. All in all it was a completely enjoyable experience. If I where a star man I'd have to give Signs a four out of four star rating. My thoughts. Yours?",Null,0,1,5 September 2002
Identity," Identity... who cares?
","This movie left me feeling kind of empty in the end. It had me hooked from the get go. The story was compelling, the acting was good, the mood and tone were fine then I figured out what was going on and got all goosebumpy with anticipation and then they let you in on the joke and it wasn't as funny as you thought it would be. Is it because we are getting desensitized to the `surprise ending' thing. Or could it be that this one just wasn't handled with as much style as some others. I don't know and don't care that's the sum of my feelings about this movie. I was disappointed at one time.. now I've just moved on and forgotten the whole thing.. it wasn't hard.",Null,0,1,8 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," Very good....
","Whoever said this was just more of the same didn't see the same picture I didÂ… What I saw introduced new characters, answered questions, created new ones, had more action and more violence. The heightened violence level of this one was surprising to me, but at the same time, it fit also. Not to worry, most of it occurs in half-light and there're not terrific amounts of gore flying around. This one also holds a level of consistency that I find lacking in a disconcertingly high number of other films. It caters to the audience, knowing that we are return visitors. I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience. X-Men fans, and fans of this genre in general, will not be disappointed.",Null,0,0,12 May 2003
Gangs of New York," Thoroughly Entertaining
","Where to start I have not been a huge fan of Scorsese ever since The Last Temptation of Christ debacle. It's not that I don't think that M.S. is a good director, I just think he has had some problems with casting pictures outside his tried and true NY style. I mean Harvey Keitel as Judas and Willem Defoe as Christ? Sure Willem may look the part but geez, neither of them could rid themselves of their Brooklyn/NY accents long enough to ever be convincing. The picture told a great story but I just couldn't get over that accent hill.   Moving forward 15 years I thought that he may have done it again. I just didn't see Cameron Diaz fitting into a role that is set in the 1850/60's. Also, I'm not a big fan of L. DiCaprio's either. Sure he can act but I just have a hard time getting that sniveling little This Boy's Life' kid out of my mind sometimes; especially when he's supposed to be tough, I expect Robert De Niro to come waltzing in and slap him down. Anyway I think that GoNY has put some of these difficulties to rest for me. Here we have a fantastic, sweeping story about this country's, but especially New York City's, shaky beginnings and we have another classic New York story from M.S.  the thing he does the best. I didn't have problems with accents, I found the story completely engaging, the acting was top notch (of course Day-Lewis stole the show, as I'm sure everyone has mentioned) but DiCaprio really impressed me and may have dispelled the image I've had of him for so long. His character struggles with his sense of loyalty; to avenge his dead father or to the man who killed him but has taken him under his wing and shown him respect. DiCaprio really relays the emotion superbly. There are scenes in this movie that will stick with me for years, i.e.: when Jenny asks Amsterdam who he is, which makes Amsterdam ask the same of himself, which causes him to come to his resolve. Simply great storytelling.  The production on this picture was nothing less than epic. It really transports you back to this country's struggle to find it's self. I found myself questioning weather any of the story was based on fact. On the DVD there is a Discovery Channel feature that put those questions to rest: most of what's in the film has some basses in historical events. Most not so flattering, but all very fascinating. If you have any interest in discovering what kind of strife our forefathers and mothers had to endure to make this country and NYC what they are today with a generous helping of great acting, directing and story telling: rent Gangs of New York and then watch the DC feature. I don't see how anyone could be disappointed.",Null,0,1,22 August 2003
Donnie Darko," Ok I give up
","What in the world or out of this world was that all about? I like to think of myself as a semi-intelligent man but give me a breakI was really intrigued by this movie. I had not really heard much about it except from the people that submit their comments on here. Most of them gave very good reviews. Then I saw who was in the movie: Jake Gyllenhaal who was wonderful in October Sky, Mary McDonnell of Dances with Wolves fame, , James Duvall from GO!, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore (who also produced). Wow! The story from what I could gather was a kind of thriller, mystery, fantasy, sci-fi kinda thing and it is. Just don't ask me what it was about. I'll admit, it had me hooked from the get go. You've got people waking up in strange locations, things falling from the sky, a weird old lady that you just know has something to do with what's going on and one creepy nightmare bunny rabbit thing that seems to be orchestrating the whole thing. Ok, good so far. You've got some great special effects, a cool eighty's sound track, intriguing characters. Getting better by the second. And you got this story that seems to be unraveling painfully slowly but you like it that way because you really want know and understand why: did that stuff happen towards the beginning and who or what is the thing that we've been seeing for the last hour and a half??  I'll just bet that old lady knows!. Ok, Now I'm really hooked.I like lima beans. Do you like lima beans? I know they have nothing to do with this movie or my comments about this movie but that's as far as I CAN comment because I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MOVIE WAS ABOUT! Strangely enough I still feel like I should like this movie. I don't know why. But I do. Perhaps I'm going mad. Please, please, please, if somebody out there can tell me what in the world this movie was about I will be eternally grateful. Then perhaps I can sleep again at night. Bottom line: If you liked Being John Malkovich' and you like being confused then you will may like this movie, however, this is a darker, dramatic movie. If that means anything. That's my take, What's yours?",Null,0,0,26 March 2002
