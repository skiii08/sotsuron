Blade Runner 2049," get some caffeine before you watch that
","Because it's boring as hell.
at least 90 minutes too long, considering what's actually happening in the movie.
let's take 10 minutes to walk to a beehive and then to a casino ....
let's not talk much for almost 3 hours.
let's have the same boring and dull soundtrack for 3 hours.
at least there are some cool visuals there, but that's about it.
story is kind of lame, Jared Leto is annoyingly boring.
to sum it all up? 
most overhyped movie of 2017 and massively pretentious.
If you want an 'artsy' movie without all that poncey crap, watch something like Melancholia. Because THAT is real art.",3,19,39,17 February 2018
