The Blair Witch Project," This Will Scare The Hell Out Of You, Not! GARBAGE!
","TBWP is by far the worst horror film ever made. I don't care what critics have to say, but the story is so lame and pretentious that there is no ONE SCENE THAT WILL SCARE YOU. The plot is pretty straightforward but I'd say it was garbage!Only Oren Peli could bring something good from this junk (Paranormal Activity). At least some scenes in that were scary. But, TBWP is not only slimy like what Josh had witnessed, it is also a gimmick, low- budget epic fail of the whole psychological genre.

Blade Runner 2049," One-Line Review: Blade Runner 2049 (2 Stars)
","Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is an equally dull and boring yet visually appealing sibling of the 1982 Ridley Scott film, both of which basically have the same plot, same setting, and even the same characters to some extent, and which can only be completed watching with a struggle unless you doze off somewhere in the 31st minute, or if I want to sound pretentious like the film looks, the 49th minute.

Scarface," Mob Mob Mob! ♦ 72%
","Al Pacino is an extraordinary actor and with a role of Tony Montana, he sits on top of my lists. Scarface is a terribly long movie, but thank heavens, it is a gradual one.Talking about the journey of a Cuban immigrant, the plot revolved around his antics and his struggles. His undaunted attitude takes him above and then we know what happens. It's been published everywhere what greed does to a person; nothing new to munch on. But, there is more: the action, the guns, the dialogs. Oh, my the way the mob genre is taken care I am sure a fan of that. And coupled with good music, Scarface is a sure winner.But at a time, when we already have The Godfather trilogy & other similar films, Scarface just hangs in there. There are some memorable scenes in here and also the performances are quite good. But, unfortunately, the entertainment factor just didn't work out for me with this gimmick.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for mob genre fans. For people who like short movies, this one is no-go. 7.2/10!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

The Monuments Men," 'It Was The Worst Movie Experience In History' ♦ 7%
","Well, that be it if I were to relate to the tag line of this ultimate propaganda film of the year. Too bad it didn't release last year; I miss so hard how this would have been ridiculed by the critics and the awards juries and would be thrown straight out of Oscar race. Any awards race, for that matter.7 people in the theater. 40 minutes later, 3 of them left. Since the beginning, not a single movie-watcher cared as I took notice in all of their faces/airs. The characters were probably given a game-bet where they should idiosyncratically enact the glorious event of the history. No script, awful screenplay, poor cinematography & a torturous background score. Just because it is a war film doesn't mean you stick trumpets into it.Lots of pretentious jokes about cigarettes and all seemed to be in-jokes because they made no sense. Not a single dialog worth quoting as is uncommon in Goerge Clooney films. No character depth, no real humor, no action sequence, as well. George Clooney walked throughout the film like he is loitering his time away. Matt Damon played a cameo. What was Bill Murray doing here? Hopeless!More, even the characters were finding it friendly to joke and tease about themselves. There was not a single shard of seriousness in any of the scene except during the chronicling of the loss, which was tremendously pompous.Just because I never get out of a movie mid-way I watched it for the whole 2 hours and left the place utterly disappointed. And then there is one speech-song that plays somewhere in the middle that pushed me to the brink of getting out. One last thing, the narration of the event in the film in the modified, deadpan voice of Clooney was the worst thing in the film.BOTTOM LINE: Do not waste your money on this. Try torrenting. No point on waiting & buying the BluRay either. Not recommended! Each of the ensemble cast disappoints; even John Goodman.",1,29,49,26 February 2014
Requiem for a Dream," Fantastically Based On Harsh Reality. ♦ 86%
","Music & cast performance are the best things this film can boast about. Other than these, the depressing theme actually is a piece of art.The narrative is gradual & the climax totally pulls it off, giving its viewers the much required food for thought. I am really impressed by the lead four actors' characters & their portrayal. Jennifer Connelly & Ellen Burstyn are brilliant.Now, with the cinematography & editing, it is totally different from most of the movie made. The fast cutting editing totally mesmerized me. In less than 110 minutes, the story of different addictions is totally fathomable. I wonder someone makes a film on the latest addictions.Although, telling a grim story, the second half is duller than first and as it approaches the end, becomes a tad boring. But the music of course keeps you engrossed. Moreover, the message that it has to give is very thinkable & thus, I rate it a good 8.6/10.BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended because of its music, editing & theme.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Another Typical Disturbing Romance Drama...
","So, you will LOVE this movie if you are a romance type; if you like movies which depict a love triangle; if you love romantic comedies WHICH give out the same clichéd moral: Love is epic and if you think you are in love, say it!Well, TPOBAW is yet another romantic comedy, only coming-of-age set in the 90s and which deciphers a romance symphony with a bunch of famous soundtracks; it shows you a story of a person who is not desperate, though he metamorphoses from an introvert to an extrovert. Here, the chief rule was forgotten, that you deal with an introvert how you SHOULD deal with an introvert. It failed to charm me because when I am looking for something new, out-of-the-box, groovy, miraculous plot, TPOBAW gives you the expected cup of coffee (or latte). The soundtrack is the best thing about this movie; the screenplay is great so is the direction. And the cast is the cherry on top. Bottom line: The Perks of Being A Wallflower is NOT EPIC. If it gets an Oscar, I'll be damned.

Iron Man 3," Not As Great As Its Predecessors. Period.
","The effects are magnificent, twists are jaw-dropping, performances are simply amazing, but the makers could not invent a story which indeed cripples the plot. So they planned to make it a trilogy. A moolah- minting brouhaha.RDJ is awesome as you all could've guessed but the screen space shared by Gwyneth & Rebecca is equal to what Anil Kapoor did in Ghost Protocol. Pity. Kingsley is great with all his accent & grueling diction. Pearce is vindictive & absolutely in his character all way long. The villains impress more here than the superhero (or his friends range - from a kid (& his sister) to suspicious women) does. Or maybe because the awesomeness of TStark has dwindled due to incessant chafing. Maybe.Some fairly fathomable flaws & lack of logic retards the viewing experience for the first half. But, second half is marvelously carved. Good direction. Good post-credit Easter egg. Nice rendition.Music reminded me of Inception & it is terrific. Screenplay/effects/SFX/CGI is all top notch & make a great complement.But... IM3 is vague in its foundation, so yes I spent some rupees for the movie, but I won't buy the BluRay (& that would cripple my MCUniverse collection along with that disastrous CAmerica) because it is just not worth. The 3D was bad, probably because of the post-production hassle.Why do I rate it 7.7 out of 10? Because I enjoyed the 2nd half more than I enjoyed the last installment of The Dark Knight or if you are a Batman fan... sixth & seventh installment of Star Trek. The lights, luster & adrenaline is pumped up towards the end, while the conclusion is kinda kinky (read bongo-bongo).BOTTOM LINE: If you follow the Marvel Universe, IM3 is a pretty relishing watch but not great as its predecessors...Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Airlift," 2016's First Good Film Is Here. ♦ Grade B-
","There is a lot being written and read about Akshay Kumar in the media lately. This film is a standing testament that he deserves that.India-born Kuwaiti businessman Ranjit (Kumar) finds his whole world turn upside down after he is caught unawares in the middle of cranky Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Already frantic enough to manage his own three-member family's escape to India, Ranjit finds that a mass of Indians, with no one else to turn to, is pulling at his sleeve for help. The story is basically about his, his family's, and his fellow compatriots' struggle to leave the warzone amid rising tension from all sides.The story is told rather nicely, minimizing the bloodshed but staying realistic at the same time. It's no doubt an extraordinary tale, and the writers manage to make it gripping, and even jaw-dropping at one, maybe two, instances. Of course, the exodus story is too good to be true, but when you KNOW that it is truly based on a real life event and few hearts did beat for almost a quarter million people's rescue mission, you automatically get the idea, and begin to realize the importance of telling such a story.It talks about one man's painstaking struggle as he reaches astronomical altruism with his bare hands, putting his own life on the warpath. It also talks about India's snail-paced bureaucracy, and how babus are the best benchwarmers in the country. However, a lot of essential minutiae were left out in the screenplay which makes the whole story look too incomprehensible for someone who hates history or who wasn't reading the news in 1990. Lot of questions are left unanswered, which if were at least attempted to answer, could have saved the audience from being in the dark. But still, the photography and production set supports in evincing the sheer madness that presumably engulfed our protagonist. (There is also a sly comment on the intolerance issue currently grappling India if you are attentive.)The film, unfortunately for enthusiasts like us, looks like it has gone through the Bollywood machine. I say this because you will see random, totally unnecessary songs playing out throughout the film. And Ranjit also shakes a leg in one or two, the only time we get to se his pearl whites. Plus, the attempt at infusing wry humor at certain parts totally messes up with those parts of the flow. Kumar is brilliant as I have mentioned, and is well supported by Kaur and other cast members. Really happy to see Malayalam film star Lena in a role.BOTTOM LINE: Raja Menon's tense war drama, Airlift, is definitely a well-made thriller which will make you feel good about your country this Republic Day, but at the end, the question still creeps in: how much has changed in 25 years?Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Gravity," Splendid. Breathtaking. Real. ♦ 100%
","We all know the degree of technicality and how charming it is that you if you want to watch it, you SHOULD watch it in 3D, in a theater, preferably in IMAX. There's no doubt, the CGI, VFX is terrific.But, moreover the film's second half focuses on life as we don't know. Of course, the space is one terrible & one terrific place to be, at the same time. But, the longing for life on Earth, to set foot on the red soil - the emotion that comes along has been captured & put into reel with Gravity. Alfonso Cuaron & his crew has just set the bells high so that we could listen to the calm sound of nature as it continues to behave, no matter what comes by.Performances are outstanding, especially Sandra Bullock's mighty air and emotional touch; George Clooney provides the humor. Supporting voices are fine. Sound mixing & music is pure genius. Cinematography blew my mind more than the direction did and I can spend few more bucks for watching that amazing climax again. Wow, what a conclusive film with only 2 physical characters! I am ready to overlook the goofs/shortcomings when a film gives me value for money. Expecting more from the makers!BOTTOM LINE: This is an experience you won't wanna miss because Gravity is the biggest thing of 2013. 200 bucks isn't hard to come by when 3D goggles are refundable, eh?

Lone Survivor," Yet Another War Flick. ♦ 46%
","The use of word 'flick' in the summary instead of 'film' seriously shows how Lone Survivor depends solely on the clichéd war elements coupled with sympathetic emotions. Well, I respect the original fighters behind the failed mission, but I still cannot understand why it had to be brought to celluloid in the first place. Too damn terrible!Letting us know the happenings through a book is a fine thing to do. But, as a film, Lone Survivor fails because: the plot heavily showcases the action scene, rather than focusing on 2 main things, characterization & the dot to dot fact file as to what went wrong. Yes, the screenplay tried hard to give us the reasons, but they either seemed ridiculous or foolish, thus giving us another reason to doubt the whole plot line-up. Unless I read the book, I might never believe this film.Next, the characters die so fast, the story gasps for life. And as the title so dramatically proposes the climax, I had no specific adrenalin rush throughout the 2 hour period. 'Pushtanwali,' a code of honor for wise Afghanistanis is something new I learned of and it is because of this, the soundtrack, make-up and Wahlberg, why I rate it 5/10.Cinematography is below average and I am not happy with the direction even. The guns are good, the action sequences jaw-dropping, but performances aren't that great and BTW, what was Eric Bana doing in this preposterously inappropriate role?BOTTOM LINE: Easily forgettable, a very cold flick.

The Big Lebowski," Powerful Characters Fooling Around. ♦ 65%
","John Goodman's character impressed me more than the Dude did. Because he is funnier & deep.Following the story of how a slacker and his bowling club friends fall into a parade of crime is written with humor in mind. The characters are very different & genuine from each other. The boldness is another thing to consider. Great music playing as the background score, there are few moments when it comes to total laugh out. The thought of these sequences will make you laugh. Improbable situations deliberately brought out by the characters will feed you with story, narration & food for thought.Lengthening the plot a bit and shut-up ending makes me feel not totally satisfied by the dude & his chums. I'll rate a humble 6.5/10 for the gang and the eclectic characters, music & setups. Very impressed as this is my first film by Coen Brothers. Steve Buscemi is good while Jeff Bridges is cool as hell.BOTTOM LINE: Extremely funny for people who can relate.

Unbreakable," Gradually Strikes Tedium & A Spine-Chilling Crescendo In Tandem At The End ♦ 78%
","Manoj Shyamalan had impressed me with his hole-infested plot of The Sixth Sense. I loved the climax. And here, on similar lines, I liked the climax... the only thing that could be liked more than anything else.Bruce Willis shuns (which can also be seen in Surrogates) the lively air (which suits him best) and spoils it at the beginning itself. But, the thrill factor stays strong, from the time it starts few minutes after the initial credits. Two simultaneous stories approaching each other in the backdrop of mysterious play is what the plot is based on. Samuel Jackson does it quite amazingly, playing a mentally infirm person trying to cajole his newly found find into believing his unthinkable theory. What follows is his ways and most surprisingly the ferocious courses of action he adopts to get in touch with the person he was so hopefully searching for.The initial idea is very strong, but stumbles... that is when we realize the plot is centered on a comic idea. That rubbishes everything. The son-father, husband wife relationships are strongly depicted but they lack cohesion and/or logic. Maybe I am skeptic with that.The twist is light but convincing. I can't check if this is a real story, but a sycophantic 7.8/10 for this venture. It intrigues, but the foundation, when exposed, looks cranky.BOTTOM LINE: Give it a try, for this is something different! Recommended!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Train to Busan," Molecule Review: Train to Busan (6 Stars)
","Just like any other zombie film, Sang-ho Yeon's Train to Busan starts and ends like you would expect it to be unless you deep dive into the dialogues between the characters that create a much more emotional impact on you. There's a biomedical threat engulfing the city of Seoul and its neighboring areas when a selfish fund manager has to take his daughter to her mom (they are separated) in Busan. But they don't know what's coming to hunt them. How these two characters plus a bunch of other ones try to save themselves from the impulsive zombies forms the crux of this horror thriller that has some insane CGI work to keep you hooked. I watched the Hindi dubbed version (with English subtitles), so naturally the effect was a bit low if you are not a Korean native. But I found Train to Busan to be an emotional drama about relationships and their absence more than it is about a zombie apocalypse. You have to decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

Darkest Hour," Molecule Review: Darkest Hour (8 Stars)
","There's a scene in director Joe Wright's Darkest Hour where Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) travels by the tube and mingles with the citizens of his country. As he walks into the Underground, it feels like any other peculiar scene from the film, but then he finds himself inside a tube car with people around him, standing awestruck and in adoration and respect. I was sitting here in my chair with the same feeling as Oldman's Churchill begins talking while his team is discussing an important treaty in other part of the city. There is no doubt that Darkest Hour is an intelligent drama made with enough doses of humor, politics, and embellishments that usually make up a World War II film, but what works for it is the perfect coagulation of all the ingredients. Watching Darkest Hour is like drinking a gallon of water in the middle of a night. The pleasure that you derive from it - be it from Oldman's terrifically nuanced performance or Dario Marianelli's exhilarating score - will have at least a full-day effect on you. It is a 'slice of history' film made in a way to appease its audience, and I, for one, am thoroughly impressed. It's an energetic affair that will make you get up from your chair, rush to the street, and dance like you have just won a war. TN.",8,0,1,28 July 2018
This Is the End," Appealingly Funny Although Grandly & Dependently Illogical. ♦ 81%
","The plot & story & premise altogether make no sense, if in the first place, we have a judging reference at all, when it comes to life, apocalypse & heaven. So, as an audience, I really enjoyed the bits & pieces of this heavily referential comedy flick.The cast is fine and I enjoyed them pulling each other's legs, although there are few points where they cross the line. Humor is painstaking at times, but some sequences will have you laugh your stomach out. Starting with a boring and/or clichéd setup, it risks itself at losing the audience, but if you wait till the inkling kicks in, you are in for a treat, with surprising cameos, gross-out jokes, humorous vulgarity & powerful slapstick. And yes, ALL THIS IF YOU HAVE A THING FOR THE MAKERS' PREVIOUS MOVIES: Pineapple Express & Superbad.Music is amazing and the climax is the most-promising thing about it, compelling me to my list of the dandiest movies of 2013. 8.1 out of 10 for the cast, humor & a faint underlying message.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended for people who hated Project X, but loved Superbad.

World War Z," World War C+. ♦ 50%
","If this film would have been a college test, it would get a C+. Coveting a Z is far-fetched expectation because the whole premise has more flaws than 2013's number of mega-flops.Starting with fast-paced thrills which only looks like zombie apocalypse turns into a parade of improbable plot twists. Many factors which are stitched together in this gimmick are flawed: the character of Brad Pitt in the whole drama, the zombie premise, the inconclusive dumb kind of an ending. I have never seen such an incomplete film made solely on a single 'twist' factor which only comes around towards the end, minutes before the end credits. It makes the whole 2-hour adventure a circus show where not only zombies, but also the people confronting them are dumb.The starting credits showing photographs of cities around the world kinda intrigued me and I sat there revving my expectation up. Then, the pretentious plot started its fabricated course; as if every single turn in the screenplay was thought with a well-decorated closure i.e. 'the twist.'Brilliant photography & fine CGI makes it pretty watchable but it is highly uncertain if you would enjoy it, accounting the huge list of epic zombie movies we have in catalog...BOTTOM LINE: It would be unwise if Brad Pitt is the single factor you would consider to watch a film constructed on an ambitious novel and popular cliché.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

","The movie is too long and boring at every nod. Not a single sequence rushes the adrenaline. Battle Royale was great; Hunger Games is gimmick. I did not read the books, so I won't judge the plot, but it quite seems unrealistic to me. And yes this reminds me of low-fi movies like The Condemned & The Tournament. Both were depressors.So, what I didn't like about this flop and overly-hyped film was: The screenplay is preposterous; soundtrack cannot be perceived accurately (God knows how it was GG nominated); darkest theme of 2012; clichéd action sequences' Bear Grylls like survival tactics and not at all entertaining dialogues.Now what I liked about the movie is Jennifer Lawrence's acting. Not her, but her acting. I still haven't been able to justify my theory how she got the role of Tiffany in SLP with Bradley.

But, Shan Of The Dead is different as it directly jumps into the scene. What follows is the survival strategy of a group who are not in good terms with each other. Human emotions galore as zombies try to eat the sapiens.Very strong cinematography pumped with good music makes this a good comedy. With all the gore involved, the horror is lukewarm.

Hands down, Hot Fuzz has the best of best of these for a film in comedy genre.And filmmakers should learn from Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg and their helpers on how to make a a funny film simply drawing from scratch. The plot is ridiculously strange and yet so fun-filled: it has action, mystery, comedy, slapstick & most of all, brilliant performers and characters. Since the beginning, the serious character of Simon Pegg continues to charm and induce humor with his dialogs and conversations. And he stays in character till the very end.There's not a single dull moment except for when the climax hits the card and things stumble out. But this does not pose a reason for not getting pleased from the rest of the movie. With hybrid amounts of CGI, special effects of explosions & brilliant camera-work, Hit Fuzz is definitely a big thing and pure British comedy.

","Not one, but two spine-tingling twists in the story towards the end will make you babble with amusement. That is if you pay attention, The Others is an immensely scary movie.Nicole Kidman is outstanding; no one could've done a better job at this role and I appreciate the makers to use confined rooms for their scenes. Well, they do induce some chills. With an amazing setup and the idea of inventiveness about the characters, the plot talks about the story of a woman and her two children. A gardener, two housekeepers enter their mansion for work and trouble begins. Some sequences, coupled with eerie sound mixing and BG music are sure to keep you hooked. The two children are amazing, as well.And when you reach the final 20 minutes, blast! the plot will hit you like a cold corpse from 200 feet above. That is the effect of The Others. It is not void from goofs and dull moments, but if Scary Movie 3 can spoof one of its scenes, it sure gotta be good.BOTTOM LINE: American or British or take Spanish (The Orphanage for instance) horror movies don't scare me much, but if I had to list, this one would sure find a number.

Rise of the Guardians," A Visual Extravaganza!
","I am terrified by the animation here & I must say that DreamWorks are surpassing those Pixar & Aardman guys like anything in the effects. Rise Of The Guardians is a visual treat with only its conclusion part going a tad amiss.The magical story of the guardians is absolute, while the voices given by celebrities is par excellence of which I loved Easter Bunny's Hugh Jackman! The wits, Santa;s jokes, Sandman's sheen & everything makes this movie look even more appealing. Not being a kid anymore, I still loved this than Brave or ParaNorman. Although the story is not new here, the animation is innovative & when music clings your ears like bamm! then whoa, it stays with you for sometime. All the lights, colors & sweet little wonderment involved makes you go gaga over it. A little emotional towards the end, funny through the middle & suspense at the beginning is what this is all about. A must watch for the deep excavation of the childhood fantasies'/delusions' innards & their habitats! Truly magnificent!BOTTOM LINE: Every animation lover should go watch this in 3D because it is DreamWorks & hell, aren't they genius?Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Concussion," Nothing Changes. ♦ Grade C+
","All films which are 'based on a true story' have little effect quotient in them, not because of how they are made, but because of how they are made to look. Concussion is one such medical drama that starts off well but ends up injuring itself.Bennet (Smith) is a Nigerian pathologist who stumbles upon a dangerous and yet undiscovered disease while performing autopsy on a football player and goes on to write a paper about it, pitting himself up against the football fraternity. The story is about his personal and professional struggle regarding this new discovery and how he is oppressed by NFL and lovers of the game collectively. While this is enough material to make biographical content look like propaganda, there isn't much embrace to realism happening in the narration. The film says that 'he will stop at nothing to expose the truth,' which is true. But what next? Nothing.People are still playing and watching and going mad about the game and that is the greatest evidence why the film's theme and story is a cold turkey. Oh yes, there is entertainment in the first act, but all goes haywire in the third act as FBI and the US administration barge in (like they always do).The screenplay is fine, not great, and manages to tell a story. Smith's accent may be a problem for some, but I think it was a necessity; his air is good. Baldwin also does a fine job as Bennet's helping hand. Overall, the way the ending comes out is what plays with the believability and effectiveness of the film. Nevertheless, it deserves a watch.BOTTOM LINE: Concussion may look like propaganda, but it is not, and the biggest problem with the film is that it falters at the end, making itself look unrealistic.GRADE: C+Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Don Jon," Actor. Writer. Director. Splendid. ♦ 86%
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a wonderful actor and his performance has always been par excellence for me. With Don Jon, he not only has considered himself as an all-rounder but also made himself a talented stalwart in the cinema industry.Don't get my appraisals so hyperbole, because: The film starts with a bang (pun unintended)! The beat music, the visual effects and the prologue as to what to expect from the guy in front of us is simply one good opening. Then, the story kicks in and the screenplay reminded me of Edgar Wright and his Cornetto trilogy. It was lovely to see the frames actually change so swiftly giving out the impression on a wider scale. The idea reaches the audience successfully. The boldness & honesty in the first part of the film makes it realistic & teenagers/adults can so highly relate to the 'masturbation factor.' You bet! Dialogs are very good. Pure work by the art, light & sound department.Then we have the performances. JGL is terrific, no doubt and his peculiar air in this would definitely make the girls drool. Then we have Scarlett Johansson who is sexy as always and acts well, too. Jullianne Moore is fine. I loved JGL's on-screen family. All of them were funny & lively & looked so real. The story is written with emotions and they kick in the second half as it gradually maneuvers into a rigid conclusion. Many reality bites have been spoken loudly in this comic romance where attention to details is one thing why direction looks good. Cinematography is good, so is the soundtrack & music. Editing could've been better.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended! It speaks volumes about sex, masturbation & love. Let the boldness not affect you.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

","With X-Men, the super-hero franchises get a push ahead. The setup is similar: superheroes with somewhat weird powers, villains & their confrontation. Although, X-Men has some kind of peculiarity in it that not only appeals but stands out.I am not surprised by the plot, but the Singer's skill of introducing characters is amazing. With proper balance of story, character depth, CGI, X-Men marks one of the best-ever introductory installation. For one, the cast line-up is appealing. For another, dialogs and humor are proportionate.But still, it lacks newness and borrows elements from published superhero movies. I am not accusing it, for any superhero movies will look the same.BOTTOM LINE: A decade later, if the charm of X-Men, evidently, sways in the atmosphere, it definitely gets a head up, ain't it?

"I, Tonya"," Molecule Review: I, Tonya (7 Stars)
","I, Tonya is a film about nearly everything. It has a woman skater (Margot Robbie) being ruthlessly trained on her mother's (Allison Janney) insistence since she was 4; it has domestic abuse; and it has a stupid crime. Yet what has stayed with me after I completed watching the movie was an exchange of dialogues between Robbie's character, Tonya Harding, and another who judged her skating performance few minutes ago and gave a bad rating. She asks why was she being rated low, to which the judge replies that performance is not only about skating, you have to project yourself as a good American from a wholesome family. 'Why can't it be only about skating?', Harding asks and the judge drives away without an answer. I love that scene, and a plenty more in director Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya because it chafes the reality and serves it with dark comedy. I don't know if I laughed out loud in any of the scenes, but everyone in the cast look like they travelled back 20 years to play life, and I did chuckle a lot. Most notable Janney, Robbie, and Sebastian Stan in that order. I, Tonya is less about the sport and more about what external stimuli can do to someone who plays it.

Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Milkha Singh Has Won. So Has The Biographical Film. Everybody Rise! ♦ 80%
","In less than ten minutes into the film, you get goosebumps all over your body. You get into high-spirits and then the story of The Flying Sikh begins...It talks more about perseverance and how man can excel even in the worst conditions than the actual atheltic history. Milkha Singh, wonderfully portrayed by the talented Farhan Akhtar is one character that induces inspiration. Akhtar now has totally proved himself as a successful actor. His demeanor is appreciable and the film does showcase his hard-work. Supporting cast is very good as well. But, the actresses were sidelined which is very apt for a bio-film.Most of the story is told in flashbacks and there is where the screenplay works. It grabs your attention. The childhood story MAY bore you a little, but every other biopic has to be honest. Much like last year's Paan Singh Tomar, BMB does have lots of surprises in store. The relation of every detail is astronomical and very well adapted. Fresh writing, inventive editing & below-average SFX/CGI makes me wanna give it a humble 8.0/10.The songs & score are energetic which do cause an urge that we run with the athletes on-screen. That is the power of Rakeysh O Mehra and his crew. I was blown away by Akhtar's bod and his expressions. Humor touches the script at times, as well.Overall, an entertaining biography which is well-written and well- executed. Only, the running time of 190 minutes COULD'VE... could've been shortened. Otherwise, everybody rise for this cinema of massive potential.BOTTOM LINE: A very good entertainer with mentoring prowess. It feels good that the team has brought an epitome into reel.

Although his crime films are way too bland for me, his experimental works are in my favorites list.Shutter Island is terrific: the story, the performances, the cast, the thrills and what-not. But I will focus on the two main aspects: music & cinematography. Every budding film-maker must go through this film first for the use of music here is what sets it apart from other films in the genre. I sat up on my chair every time Robbie Robertson sampled old classics in the score. The cinematography manages to capture out attention and throw it on screen.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A Lot, Lot Better Than The Prequel. ♦ 80%
","...if that's what you're concerned about. Because I can tell I was little doubtful about this sequel. And I went in with second thoughts. Moments inside, having welcomed by the extraordinary physique of Chris Evans, I got imbibed into the screen and the 3D glass was my medium.Mind you, 3D did justice to the film and towards the end I am sure you will realize your money didn't go waste. Continuing with where it ended last time, Captain America finds himself putting his brain into work. Teaming up with Black Widow, done over-smartly by Scarlett Johansson, Steve Rogers finds himself in a high-octane war where he cannot trust anyone. Many twists are thrown at us which look credible enough to follow. Characters are well-built but I don't know what Cobie Smulders was doing here. Even Robert Redford looked like he just ditched his old boat from All Is Lost (2013) and suited up. Chris Evans is very good, both in action & prose. Samuel L Jackson is good.I liked the humor & its timing. Moreover, the adrenaline pumping chase sequences, stunts, airborne action scenes - all were charismatic and well-directed. But, a superhero movie is a superhero movie & they say one & only one thing. This one tries to slightly differ and gets caught up with its past. That is equally justifiable as it is interesting.I never got bored in these 130 minutes. Now, this 8 I am rating is the greatest I can give for a superhero movie and it is for the special type of fun it endorses.

Interstellar," A Dazzling Spectacle About Space Voyages. ♦ 70%
","While I was calm as space until I found the propaganda take effect on the plot, I couldn't really decipher why flashy humor and melodrama (read sentiments) was in abundance about a journey which requires serious concentration. Of course, the makers, the film lovers, and people who pretend to be in the crowd by advertising they are the film lovers - they all could bring up many reasons about it: 'humankind is involved, bud. what do you think humans are? we are emotional, you ignorant piece of space debris!' Others may say: 'humor lets them relax, don't you see? Man, Nolan is God. Nolan Nolan Nolan!'Agreed.I'm just an opinion-er. The plot starting off depending more on Hans Zimmer than the actual visuals, Interstellar talks about a near- future Earth (non-fiction #1) where crops are dying, dust storms are giving people not rashes, but serious, cancerous lung diseases, and people are forced into agriculture (Orwellian? or simply fascist?). So, the people who are actually farmers but pretend to be geniuses with lots of love for their daughters and sons and baseball, stick drapes to their shoulders and play faulty superheroes. Matthew McConaughey is one such character. He is very good, and I would have used the word 'excellent' had it been a weepy melodrama with Meryl Streep as the actress who talks about saving the Earth by committing suicide or something, eventually both sweeping the Oscars. But, no, you have more annoying characters to come.The superheroes, commissioned by a propagandist Sir Michael Caine through NASA, go on a voyage to find a habitat for humans who are all dying by coughing only or maybe starving, too. Now I was thoroughly impressed by the space spectacle (fiction #1). Double Negative folks are really something; Inception, even. While it will remind you of Gravity, it holds it for too long and this is where melodrama kicks in. Mind you, as we go further, you will find humor in the nooks and corners of the film. You may laugh, you may weep, and all science fiction disappears in thin air, unless you think the inside of a space shuttle in a studio shown in the film gives you the wind of it. Altercations between the characters kicks in, and it seemed they didn't only annoy the audience, but each other, too. Anne Hathaway was annoying, although her character seemed real (non- fiction #2). Expendables 4 is what you will see for the next few minutes. I am starting to recoil from Nolan's notions just because of one particular scene, which takes up almost all of the second half and all we see is the constipated characters doing a interstellar space stunt with a shuttle and their roving vehicle. After the scene, there is heavy humor and the characters testify it. Irony.The time and space parameters with respect to their linearity and how age matters was wonderful to watch and it was the only new thing that fascinated me in this celluloid. The next interesting stuff were the climax sequences, which you will require at least some basic idea about physics in order to construe. It was like Upstream Colour, but with more CGI and brains.There is intergalactic fight scene between two astronauts which may not have been put up for humor effect, but I laughed. A villain (non-fiction #3) comes out of nowhere and takes up at least 20 minutes, which further upset me.The main story as a whole is, thus a mixture of fiction and non- fiction. The science about dimensions was really food for thought and mesmerizing to watch. To ponder upon the final sequences per se will bring you pleasure and you may end up clapping, even, but that is how Nolan's films have been all these years. They flip-flop from one element to another, sometimes without coercing them together. This leads to a pressurized air gap in any normal moviegoer's analysis. I think I may have helped in breaking the pressure.A film which 1. refreshes propagandist theories about government and survival and holds onto it (which people are somehow trying to forget and move on with their lives and click selfies), and 2. uses thematic elements unfathomable to normal audience cannot be considered a masterpiece, at least in celluloid. Dante's Divine Comedy is understandable, so is Rodin's The Thinker. And so was Nolan's Inception. But, Nolan's Interstellar, which is an artistic space film, but fails in many other sub-genres? You decide.BOTTOM LINE: Interstellar is a dazzling spectacle and I use the word 'spectacle' because it mocks itself in some ways, publishing a story so naive and situational and dramatic, it is a modified version of what ended up in Kubrick's or even Ridley Scott's work-desk garbage bin 20 years ago.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Capsule Review: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri
","The humorous undertone in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri helps you bear the brutally honest picture of a crime and its aftermath that it paints so magnificently. Watching Frances McDormand play a rebellious mother of a woman who was raped while dying is satisfying to the extent that can only be disturbed by Sam Rockwell's performance as this fiery young policeman who boasts off his racism as his grandest weapon. If not the cliched story, there is enough bulbs of entertainment and social issue treatment to consume here that is topped with some of the most fabulous performances of the year. Woody Harrelson joins the talented cast as the police chief who is torn between the mother's rebellious stunt - iconic in the movie and for the next few decades - and a personal issue to drive the crisply-written film that mocks the law enforcement system and reinforces the theory that man is the biggest and most powerful killer. Other than few slips in Martin McDonagh's writing towards the end, there's not a dull moment in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, MIssouri which, if not too cinematic, has some great billboard design and a ritzy ad agency office. Watch it for its relevant theme, incredible performances, the subtle references that are so highly relatable, and the basic idea that of those billboards. TN.",7,1,3,21 January 2018
Pacific Rim," Overly Fictitious, Irritatingly Large Tale Of Blown-Out Imagination. ♦ 48%
","The makers thus succeed in re-introducing a genre. But they are neither the pioneers, nor polishers. With Pacific Rim, Guillermo del Toro satiates his own filmmaking fad, but this is just too fictitious to interpret and is just a potpourri of overwhelming visual effects and poor dialog delivery by an inept & loose cast.The base idea, had the makers taken few more moments out of 120 minutes to explain, the experience would've amplified twofold. But, they got to attend to the gaudy CGI. Then we have some half-baked to raw characters who do not fail to indulge in light-hearted banter when a monster-led apocalypse is inevitable. Or two of the worst scientist characters who play with their wits & ideologies while working on glossy instruments. Terrible.Music is the only thing 'pacific' in this tale of otherwise poor screenplay & plot. The action sequences are larger than life and beautiful, but with the aforementioned use of heavy CGI, it got garbled towards the few end scenes. The countenances of characters were funny & the poor placement of humor just wrecked havoc to my experience. I felt like running out of the theater hall, but the concept is surely intriguing, which kept me.It sets a base for future filmmakers.

Nightcrawler," Dark Shades Of A Proud, Competitive World. ♦ 90%
","I love crime dramas, and when the drama is about a person who undergoes psychological metamorphosis, I jump up in my seat. Nightcrawler promises to be one such drama and it succeeds well in its promise.Talking about a cunning thief-turned-freelance journalist Lou (Jake Gyllenhaal), the story takes you inside one of the most daring professions and uptight businesses in the current world. Lou embarks on a journey to earn easy money out of his newfound passion which he also happens to be good at: crime scene shooting. His road to mastery as a freelancer could not have been shown in a better way: he self- studies and grasps things that he believes will be useful in that particular profession. Being manipulative and daring, he is an opportunist who scavenges for news stories as Gilroy's script gathers pace. He stops at nothing, and by the startling climax, it is evident that Lou has been transformed into an unscrupulous psychopath who will do anything to keep the meter running.The plot addresses the issue of how dangerous journalism can be, and forces us to think about the present codes of journalism followed around the world. In a fast-moving life, journalists do not care for lives, depicting a new world order. As a result, the film turns out to be engaging and sort of a real procedural from a journalistic eye.Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific and totally into the character throughout the movie. His eyes, physique, make-up - all work of pure genius - transcends his usual performing skills. Riz Ahmed, as the amateur sidekick, is very good. Rene Russo gives an enthralling performance. All are directed well and although, few scenes may seem like dragging, they culminate into excellent story arcs.A great score drives the whole drama and creates a thriller out of it. Seamless screenplay, some good photography, and a dark setup succeeds in bringing out a perfect package which entertains as well inspires us to think about the corrupted times we live in.BOTTOM LINE: There is no particular bad thing about Nightcrawler.

","Now I am not talking specifically about OCD, but some people do rejoice at the fact they suffer from it. The Aviator talks beautifully about the guy who pioneered aviation. His actions, through THIS film, will set a role.Leonardo DiCaprio is a maverick. His Oscar loss is the brightest example of flawed judgment. The way he lives as Hughes in this biopic is beyond anyone's skill or repertoire. And his interpretation of OCD, coupled with startling agony is one of the many genius antics he does and amuses in this film. With a beaming supporting cast and very-well written plot, the film advances good in the first hour. Then as the camera focuses on the personality & his disorders & thoughts, the screenplay quite makes it boring at two or three nodes.

My favorite character is Rorschach, as might be of almost all. His voice bewitches you; Jackie Earl Haley is outstanding. Jeffrey Dean Morgan & Matthew Goode are marvelous, as well. Supporting cast is good.The plot, set in the 80s talks about two generations of superheroes, trying to save the world. The masked crime-fighters, now under attack, have to find out the person behind the killing. What follows is an investigation & a predictable culmination. Some courageous AND timid sequences in between. Humor is well placed. Inventive editing & CGI. Even greater ideologies. The casting could've been better, I feel. The setup is well carved & polished.The climax was little equivocal and the references of future-past time travel was ridiculous. I hated Dr Manhattan's character. It was implied to be bumptious & jokey. Running time is too unreasonable. So, 7.9 it is.BOTTOM LINE: A good superhero movie, well worth trying. Recommended to a niche audience who love the genre.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Baby Driver," Capsule Review: Baby Driver
","If there's one thing that Baby Driver gets right then it is the soundtrack, but this is no Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 where the soundtrack was relevant and enhanced the film's appeal. Here, the tracks are played randomly with the hope that just because they are catchy, upbeat, or generally hummable, they will have the audience hooked. Director and writer Edgar Wright carves a story that has no character background or development and depends on second-hand car chase sequences and cringe-worthy dialogues to keep his characters occupied. Chocolate boy Ansel Elgort plays the young and stylish version of the Transporter where he drives armed gangs to and from heist locations. With few stupid idiosyncratic reservations of his own just so to make himself look smart, he further annoys his audience with unmotivated actions and gets absorbed into a gummy romance written without an iota of imagination. You are to believe that his constant exposure to random music helps him maneuver cars better for there is no explanation as to how this taciturn kid with parental issues learned driving like a knife of butter. There's a hint somewhere, but of course Wright didn't think it was enough for an informed audience. He's a good kid, some of his characters say of him sometime in the film, but they miss the part about how irritating he is. Almost every other character has shades of absurdity that doesn't gel well with whatever the story is all about. Throwing Easter eggs about other popular heist movies does not and will not make a movie better. It at least has to have remarkable car chase sequences, witty dialogues, and a strong and substantial plot, none of which this film excels in. And the final 10 minutes are the worst I have seen all year. Baby Driver is a fast-paced drivel that can make even lovable actors like Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx look poor in retrospect. I watched this after the news story about Kevin Spacey came out, and yes, it did negatively impact my experience. But Baby Driver has bigger issues. TN.",2,1,2,22 January 2018
Split," One-Line Review: Split / 3 Parts Boring, 1 Part Thrilling / 4 Stars
",I was impressed by James McAvoy's ultra performance as a person with dissociative identity disorder and his ability to quickly change from one personality to another at a click of two fingers but I was largely unimpressed by director Shyamalan's slow-paced first 90 minutes in Split where nothing really happens.

American Psycho," Confusing Parade Of Killings. ♦ 52%
","This one is so confusing with all its messages implied, it puts the viewers in a very hard time figuring out.Christian Bale is, hands, down, terrific with his character. His physique magically portrays Patrick Bateman. Supporting cast is good, as well. But, the story is something not to be praised about. Because, there seems no sense in it with the character either going bizarre or on a rampage. Well, I know what 'psycho' means, but the history is not clearly visualized. Something's wrong with the movie & as the movie itself, I can't figure it out. People can relate to the central character to a point, but in the second half, everything goes haywire.Music & score is good, humor is good, dialogs are zany - but screenplay is fizzy.

Hugo," The God Of Visual Effects. ♦ 70%
","That is what kept me going and then there is history of cinema. I was gob-smacked to have the history of cinema re-narrated on screen and now I have a list to watch, of the first movies.Hugo is a masterpiece, not because of the story, but because of the splendid visual effects. I was taken aback when every single sequence had the dust swaying around like I was inside the film along with the cast. And with a beautiful performance by front-runners along with great direction, this film is the right food for cinema aficionados.Now with what I did not like: the story is little shallow to be believable and with the conclusion so instantly inferring, it further attenuated the whole point. The reminiscent of old movies was absolute, but the editing is very poor. Great cinematography & CGI, but when you have an abrupt screenplay, it turns you off. To be frank, the first half really is monotonous and it is only the second part where fun kicks in & your curiosity is answered without killing the cat.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended still, because of the aesthetic value and pure cinema pleasure. The beauty of Hugo lies in its VFX, Ben Kingsley & Asa Butterfield. Sacha Baron Cohen is splendid. For it has won 5 Oscars, go have a look, you won't be disappointed.",7,2,2,2 December 2013
The Orphanage," Not Cheap Scary, Also A Good Thriller!
","El Orfanato is a good movie, worthwhile for its cast's performances, direction and story.Belen Rueda is terrific, with all her motherhood character and savior. I was awestruck at her character portrayal and she's the one who induces emotion here. The remaining cast is very supportive. Direction is good, screenplay is amazing and music is creepy.But, what The Orphanage is not is a horror movie. It didn't scare me as other mainstream horror movies do, but yes, it is a thriller with a story so appealing, you may even cry at the end. It shows a mother's love no matter what the circumstances. And the crookedness & innocence of it will intrigue you. Never a story told in an honest way.For being a suspense thriller and not a horror movie, I give it 6/10 most of which is for the story and acting.

Dangal," A 'DanGIRL' Triumph. ♦ Grade A-
","Majority of sports films have lots of things in common between them. This one here tries hard and succeeds in being in the minority.Mahavir Phogat (Aamir Khan) is a home-grown National-level wrestling champion who hopes to see his unborn son(s) make India proud by winning gold at the international level. Blame his X chromosomes, but he and his wife give birth to not one, not two, but four daughters, much to Mahavir's disappointment. He surprisingly stops trying for a fifth child and packs up his dreams. However, as the kids grow up and show signs of aggressiveness, he realizes that even though their gender orientation is different from his, they may be good contenders for the game of wrestling. Convinced that his two eldest daughters, young Geeta (Zaira Wasim) and Babita (Suhani Bhatnagar), may help him take his passion forward, he begins training them - pure Ludhiana-style. The story then follows Mahavir's strict native coaching as the girls grow up (Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra) and try to climb the ladder, albeit while facing a series of stereotypes, hurdles, and rampant demoralization from the society.As a viewer who is still in awe with the film, I will only talk about one specific (and the most important) sequence, which occurs towards the end of the first half. Without giving any spoilers - in order to prove that she doesn't need more of her father's guidance, Geeta gets into the pit to fight against the man who helped create her. The two-minute montage that Tiwari and cinematographer Sethu get absolutely, perfectly right, all with Aamir and Shaikh's emotive reactions, is the most poignant scene seen in any Bollywood film this year. There is so much in that short sequence that defines the powers of human vanity, egotism, and haughtiness - all blended with humanity's most vital feelings - it will make you cry. That particular sequence is what got me, and I am going to break order by recommending this film right in the third paragraph itself. Go watch it in your nearest theater now.Five minutes is all it will take you to get hooked into the otherwise long film (at 160 stimulating minutes). Delightful sequences that will lay out what is to be expected as you move forward with Mahavir and his daughters' story. The cause of women empowerment is loud and clear as Tiwari and his allies etch a story about the usual stereotypes that surround when it comes to 'women in sports'. The male gaze also makes an appearance here as Mahavir gives zero care to the world and moves ahead with his talented daughters in an attempt to shift mountains. How a father does what he does, regardless of his approach, but still thinks of his girls' upbringing and a bright future is what Dangal essentially talks about. It tries to smash and subdue the voices that sway in the air about inequality, and oppression of women and their rights. As far as the narrative is concerned, it's a triumph, because it sheds light on both sides of the coin. Mahavir's wife is worried about her daughters' food-making skills, but she is cajoled that people are not living in caves anymore. Of course, the narrative is formulaic, as Tiwari uses the usual elements (think Chak De! India (2007), Sultan (2016)) to ignite chatter about the much-talked-about cause, patriotism, the decrepit sports authority of India, and other related things. The ability to shed light into how it is the government which is to be blamed for sportspeople not winning medals should be lauded, but let's not give the film the hat of a pioneer. Other films in the genre think of it as water under the bridge.The young girls do a very good job at enacting kids who are growing up and who love pani-puri, yet are forbidden by their father. Their determination in portraying their characters is terrific. Same with Fatima Sana Shaikh who is well- directed, yet her character is written with some traces of bad Bollywood in it. She steals the show, nonetheless. Sakshi Tanwar and Aparshakti Khurrana support the main cast very well, with the latter providing comic relief.Aamir Khan justifies his role, and makes it obvious why he is showered with certain adjectives and nouns. After Talaash (2012) and Dhoom 3 (2013), his authority as a game-changer in Bollywood was beginning to diminish, but this one here surely has the strength to resurrect him as the man. His fitness regime for the portrayal (can be watched on YouTube) reassures that he may still be in the game.Dangal is a film that makes the right use of background music, slow motion capturing and editing, and other film factors. It keeps its audience at the edge of their seats throughout the film, yet stays relevant, and never bores. Thumping songs will get you higher and make you marvel at the cinematic excellence as it unfolds layer by layer. Overall, there aren't enough sentences to describe the lists of things that this film achieves. It rhetorically asks if women aren't better than men. Then it proves that it's all about equality, making feminists cower at the backseat. What took them years and years to start, this film here did it in less than three hours.BOTTOM LINE: Nitesh Tiwari's 'Dangal' is surprisingly brilliant for a sports drama. It is a film that is not only about sports or the spirit of winning, but about a father's quest to make his children understand what passion can do, and how one can set an example. Other than learning some good wrestling strategy, Dangal is a triumph that will appeal to everyone. Go for it!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",9,6,12,24 December 2016
We're the Millers," There's Something About The Millers. ♦ 66%
","I laughed numerous times and trust me, they were at the intended humor and by the look of it, the writers have worked hard on those parts. But if we are working on the logic here, don't be a fool and move ahead.More and more movies are skipping the logical factor from their plots and We're the Millers is no different.

","Okay! So SLP has emotions, amazing performances, wonderful story and screenplay and some fresh writing... but I give it a 7 and it cannot beat my favorite rom-com this year, Moonrise Kingdom!. Here's why:You take up the long-lost and beloved genre of rom-com and take up all the Oscar winners' tit bits and you make a movie. You add some emotions, shaky camera-work (which they term realistic), great actors and you get SLP. It's a simple drama and I couldn't find comedy in it. Yeah, it made my partner cry... so what?

","I had no expectations from any of the film crew except Jeremy Renner. But he seems to be busy after waking up disturbingly and enjoy carnal knowledge with a mysterious lass.Absurd dialogs, poor cinematography, atrophied CGI and dumb action sequences is what this film is all about. You probably already know what the story is. And you can very well imagine the plot, as well. Words like 'awesome,' being used by teenagers in a world of ancient theme when blood flashes over their faces is something, no serious movie-goer would appreciate. Yet, the makers rejoice in their own mistakes. The lead sister-brother pair, who never seem to exhaust in stamina or strength, find themselves saving a village's ass from witches. Of course, dim- witted witches.Superhero movies with such vague plots & screenplay are mounting up in mainstream Hollywood. They lack everything to be even considered. Waste of talent (Hans Zimmer) & money & time. I don't want a sequel.Women in here love to wobble their chests and reveal their cleavages (or is it their dresses?), while their men succeed acting brainlessly. With a hard try of bringing emotions into the already worn-down plot they end up referencing King Kong; I rate it a merciless 2.4/10.BOTTOM LINE: Not recommended.

Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Crisp, Clean, & Faithful. ♦ 68%
","Rogue Nation is a film with lots of energy and novelty. Hunt's (Cruise) escapades are breathtaking as he and his team begin their seemingly impossible mission to hunt down an international terrorist (Harris). The stunts inch closer and closer to absolute brilliance if one compares it with the film's predecessors. Ghost Protocol was rad, and now I can even take the risk of saying that Rogue Nation is even more.The film doesn't lose sight and is FAITHFUL to the franchise's theme. It treads into unexplored territory leaving the audience in awe and wonder. The sequences are stunningly shot by Robert Elswit who also gifted us Nightcrawler (2014) few months ago. With CRISP writing at parts, the story is fairly believable. But of course, there are holes which if detected, should be ignored for a good viewing, hoping you are not one of the v-bloggers who take pride in videos like '10 Mistakes About Rogue Nation In 100 Seconds.'The antagonist starts smart, but ends up like a rabbit, afraid of its hunters. Plus, there is an air of romance that touches the plot for some time, but thankfully flows away, preventing the whole drama from falling.Cruise is terrific; the guy can run and boy, with elegance. I am sure we will never get bored of him. Renner sports a grim look throughout as he is more like a bureaucrat in this installment. It was fun watching Ferguson and Pegg. Overall, they are all well-directed.Films in the Mission: Impossible franchise are erroneously considered and compared with other action films by junkies, giving rise to polarizing reviews citing mindlessness and plot holes. It is only when one accepts M: I films as pure spy-fi is its real magnitude perceived. The fifth installment is thus a better concoction that has high entertainment quotient.BOTTOM LINE: Rogue Nation has car and bike chases, masks, saxorifles, and glass cages.

Dunkirk," Capsule Review: Dunkirk
","Dunkirk is unarguably one of the most technical sound films made so far, but at the same time the effect it has on you is limited. For starters, it requires its audience to have good knowledge of the infamous Dunkirk evacuation that happened towards the end of World War II, without which you cannot make complete sense of the plot. And even if you are well-versed with history, the degree of repetitive sequences, albeit beautifully crafted, is just too high to make it an epic war film. The score by Hans Zimmer is arguably the biggest character in Dunkirk, which manages to keep you hooked despite the aforementioned shortcomings. Director Christopher Nolan knows how important the score and camera work are for a film that tries to bring events happening in air, land, and sea together, which is one thing that works well for Dunkirk. There is tension throughout the 100 minutes of running time, thanks to Zimmer's ticktock tunes, and one that will make you unable to move. Performances are great since dialogue is scarce and subtle, but it still shows how talented Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead are. The use of numbing score and captivating shots is what hides the hollowness of the plot and what makes this an average watch at best. Director Nolan had set the bar quite too high with his past few films but Dunkirk seems to be missing the trademark. TN.",5,0,1,7 January 2018
The Intouchables," Absolutely Stunning!
","What a marvelous way of story-telling is this! Adding huge ounces of principles, love, friendship & emotions into a bucket of life story is something so splendid the filmmakers have succeeded in doing, that not only will The Intouchables touch you, but also will stay with you for decades.I say it because the story is not new to our cinematic brains. It has been sampled before (check out Guzaarish (a Bollywood debacle), Jab We Met (theme), etc.). But, the freshness & adrenaline pumping sequences are high above the reach of typical non-standard plots & SFX or CGI. Without making use of cheap-stakes, surrounding itself with pure blessings of wonderful music, budding cast, performances & screenplay is what makes it a beautiful drama. The comedy will stay with you with lots of improvisation in the slapstick. While the character depth is astronomical, what works for The Intouchables is that it is genuine. From its core.A good 8.7/10 for a wonderful experience. A wonderful story talking about human relations, notwithstanding the stereotypes, flashing the happier (& the dull) side of humanity & its nature, topped with a perfect climax. Minus 1 for the blunt center-story. The Intouchables is simply the best movie to come out of modern France... yet!BOTTOM LINE: 100% Recommended.

The Exorcist," Intense Horror. ♦ 82%
","Classics have always been boring, if you try to watch them in this YOLO generation. But, The Exorcist is one classic horror you will not be disappointed of.It starts off with something indirect. The climax is related to the beginning. And, the story between them is entailing. Stricken by an invisible spirit, daughter of a popular actress, becomes possessed, the plot of which fails to mention why. The performance of the girl is splendid. The editing is average. And the make-up, I should say, is very genuine. You see, in horror flicks, the make-up has to be authentic and not superfluous. The Exoricst gets an 8.2/10 for this. And the music. 'Tubular Bells' creates a bloodcurdling mood. Fantastic.It chills you; the dialogs being funny sometimes, they mostly haunt you. Although, the plot is a tad feeble, the narration quite gets a nod.

M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," Hagiography 101 â™¦ Grade D-
","Director Neeraj Pandey has given us some good thrillers in the last few years, but this contrived biographical film about a cricketer raises the point that he should stick to thrillers.Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput) is a young man who is from an economically poor background and lives with his family in Ranchi. After having picked up by his school's cricket coach for wicket-keeping, Mahendra is exposed to the depths of cricket. When he realizes that he is good at it, Mahendra decides to take it up seriously, albeit at his father's (Anupam Kher) disappointment who thinks people who choose sports as a career are losers. The narrative then takes up a coming-of-age setup and showcases Mahendra's journey as he lands a job with Indian Railways and consequently plays for the national cricket team.The film is essentially a combination of peacock sequences to entice a gullible fan. With more than three hours of running time, the stretches of sequences that outline Mahendra's 'journey of struggle' are hardly believable, because it feeds its audience with content that they want to see. There's not a single uncomfortable moment in the film, and biopics are confirmed failures when they do not explore the entirety of the topic in question. The film bites off more than it can chew and tries to encapsulate the whole decades-long life of the cricketer, conveniently written to cover the topics already in the public domain. For instance, Mahendra's unenthusiastic bout as a railway ticket collector is sampled at length, when there were more interesting periods that could have been covered. Further, since it's also a Bollywood film, the romance quotient was high when the plot introduces Mahendra's love interests, simultaneously trying to induce sentimentality somewhere along.A perfect example of how biopics, and not documentaries, are made is how Danny Boyle pulled off Steve Jobs' story in his 2015 Academy Award-nominated film. That film chronicled the man's life story in a peculiar way and succeeded at it. Here, the blame is on director Pandey who chose to chronicle the whole story and stick with a formulaic approach where the final product looks like a lavish gourmet dish. As an informed viewer, one wants to see the negative and positive sides of a star in the making, and this film offers neither, not even partially. It's only intention is to showcase a contrived and ridiculously manipulated life-story of a sportsman who is known only in a certain niche, as is also evident from the perspective of a notable character in the film.Therefore, it is not a biography, but a hagiography created only to give a final adieu to the real life personality's fame which is inching towards its exhaustion. Additionally, one has all the evidence to prove that propaganda is at aggravated play here, because of the spotlight decipherment of the central character's alleged wrong notes with a colleague. So, is this a plot to hit the ice? Maybe, but a very wicked medium for that.Rajput manages to maneuver his character with ease, but his expressions seemed to come in between the play. His hard-work is, however, ubiquitous, and that must be lauded. Leading ladies do not have much to say or play, as they are used as puppets, Bollywood style. Anupam Kher is the only person in the whole film whose actions come out as natural. The use of formula is apparent in almost all filmmaking factors, except for the terrible CGI. And if I start listing all the commercial brands mentioned in the film, I could write an essay and stand last in a competition.Finally, the film only uses the good points so as to etch a spot in the cinematic history of a man who is assumed to be a rock-star in his field. Sure, the international cricket matches are a testament to that, but if cinema is used as a platform to blatantly advertise the enemies of Andy Warhol, then I'm personally sorry that it is doomed. No wonder the film slyly tries to compare another cricketer with an imaginary being, for there's a film about him coming up, too.All said and done, the film is perfect for a cricket fanatic who puts his/her own life behind the game, only to revere the players. And, unless the people and the country decide to pay less attention to it and the dramatic madness attached, things WILL stay the same.BOTTOM LINE: Neeraj Pandey's 'M S Dhoni: The Untold Story' neither explores the untold territory nor goes into detail about the unpleasant attributes of the personality's life. It's a controlled account of a man who hopes to vindicate himself, make himself part of cinematic history, and salvage his dwindling popularity - all at the cost of mocking himself.

But its sequel fairs a lot less because the fun quotient declined drastically because of the huge number of illogical references/sequences.Bruce Willis is great as always, with his wit & death-defying stunts. Only the plot was a tad too lame for some action scenes were I personally believe, death would've been imminent. The airport ambiance and the terror suspense builds up for sure, but when it reaches crescendo, little disappointment accompanies it much unlike the predecessor. But you should watch it to believe it.Direction is appreciable, screenplay is kinda jerky because I expected one or two punchlines here and there, of course from Bruce but that is not much of a problem when you have the remaining dialogs kick ass!Too much of explosions and mind-numbing fires actually degraded my film- watching experience, but yes, Die Hard 2 is one hell of an action movie with impeccable standards and mind-boggling instances. Supporting cast is great and no character was extra baggage, unlike Die Hard 1.BOTTOM LINE: Die Hard 2 is a must-watch if you are following the series and if you a thing for movies which speak nothing but only action. :D 7/10Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

No Country for Old Men," Ferocious As Hell. ♦ 82%
","This is my second Coen Brothers' movie & I am already a fan. Because, it talks about life as a whole and not in parts.Always depicting violence, the makers in here have gone one step further into psychological reasoning behind the violence. The cast performance, cinematography, direction, plot & screenplay are perfect factors. Some of them are second only to music, although a little more engaging score could've changed my 8.2 rating. Speaking too much but not going over is what the plot does. The trembling effect it has on its viewers is that the definitions re boundless and 80% of the happenings are free to imagination. As the message that comes out of it is varied, No Country For Old Men is a must watch, since we need to feel the gravity of the other side of humanity.Alas, it does have its dull moments, mostly carried by conversations or self-thoughts. Personally, these are the only discrepancies I found.One more reason to watch is Javier Bardem & his phenomenal portrayal.

Toy Story 4," Capsule Review: Toy Story 4 (5 Stars)
","There are a few scenes in Toy Story 4 that reminded me why I was so hyped when they released the first poster and why I now took the pains and spent the resources to grab an IMAX 3D ticket, but then it played out like an ordinary toy story (without the caps) that just lacks the panache and heart that the prequels had and which I dug. You know what is going to happen in Toy Story 4 and with a cliched plot line about a villain doll trying to earn the love of a human kid is all but unenterprising, it just reduces the faith I have in Pixar. Apart from a few funny scenes and the magnificent animation, this was a sheer disappointment. TN.",5,7,17,29 June 2019
Climax," MAMI Review: Climax (7 Stars)
","There is so much energy in Gaspar Noe's Climax that I wanted to jump out of my seat and start dancing to the beats of the continuously humming techno soundtrack. Sadly, my fellow audience wouldn't have let me, but deep inside I believe that if I actually did, they would have only joined me. Such is the power of Noe's beautiful, philosophical, and insane techno-dance thriller that hypnotizes from the first frame itself through its immensely talented actors to the anti-climactic credits placement and shots of textual philosophical one-liners to eventually the conveyance of the moral of the short story. The story about a group of French dancers practicing in an old abandoned school premises for an upcoming tournament so that they can compete with the Yankees and show who rules the dancing world takes an ugly turn when the idiosyncratic characters - not one as same as the other - find out that their cocktail was laced with LSD by someone. Who? Why? These questions is in everyone's mind, but the music never stops and no one is in their right mind to sit and think and investigate. And by the time director Noe ends the shots - most of which are single takes - you realize that what you are seeing in front of you is the definition of intoxication and its consequences in its purest form. Climax is true madness and it will blow you away with its truthfulness. TN.(Watched and reviewed at its India premiere at the MAMI Mumbai Film Festival.)",7,13,32,1 November 2018

","Wreck-It Ralph is amazingly funny, entertaining and appealing to almost everyone - be a 90s kid or a YOLO teenager.The animation is terrific and by far the most colorful animated movie of 2012 I have seen. Should it win the Oscar, well it is good enough with its direction, emotional plot and characters.The innocence, realism & fantastic approach of the characters is the USP of this movie and the emotional punch with somewhat like an Aesop's fable at the end is very good. Children will love it. A wonderful family entertainer with inventive thoughts about inside of an arcade and all the niceties - taken care of nicely. As a whole, I loved the idea, and the execution!

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Review For People Who Haven't Watched LOTR: Fantabulous!
","The first installment of J R R Tolkien's The Hobbit novel is extraordinary. I haven't watched the LOTR trilogy but have heard a lot. Nor have I read any of those books. But after watching I am gonna read those including The Silmarillion.It is indeed a very unexpected movie experience with all the colors, essence, hue and magic. I was taken aback by how the plot revolves around the people most valuable and then etches the story onto our minds. Every sequence - one after another will bring you closer to the screen, and if it's 3D then bang! Absolute marvel!The adventure to back home shows many life values, aspects and notions including home-sickness. Martin Freeman is great and I could never guess he was 41. Gandalf is mystery and yet he knows why he had called the lead character of the series which he is not at that time. You feel a peculiar kind of happiness when things gel and you are not confused at the movie.Special effects is fantastic, screenplay is intriguing, direction is magnificent and the cast and their performances are just par excellence. Bravo! is what I shout at the whole crew of this movie. Yet there are some unnerving scenes and the melodrama at the end troubled me a bit.But let me tell you, this is gonna make history am sure because this is fantabulous piece of cinema!WATCH OUT FOR: The conversation between Gollem & Bilbo!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

The Grand Budapest Hotel," A Free-Wheeling Journey Without Substance. ♦ 63%
","I am a fan of Wes Anderson.His screenplay and direction is what I adore. But the screw-ball he adds to his frames is why I love his films. The Grand Budapest Hotel has all these factors and that is why I rate it a 6/10. But, when it comes to movies, stories do matter. They are the indirect, significant factor that keeps the audience hooked. Unfortunately, this film drops low in it.The whole film is an extraordinary example of artistic cinema. Each and every frame will enthrall you and you may drop dead with the colors, music and slapstick. The story of a concierge who is framed for a murder of his inamorata finds himself escaping prison with the help of his protégé: well, that doesn't work out much for me. Yes, it narrates through a non-linear screenplay and I am a fan of that, but here in, it only succeeds in cramming the audience's mind with confusion. Even if you pay attention, which you will, won't be enough to comprehend the crux of what the writer (Stefan Zweig?) is trying to say. The ending is clever but I did not feel content with the plot. The use of letterbox aspect-ratios was a bad idea.BOTTOM LINE: You may/may not enjoy the story but you will definitely be entertained by the sheer extravaganza of the art setup. After all, Anderson is famous for that, isn't he? Watchable!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",6,1,7,5 June 2014

","Yorgos Lanthimos's fascinating period drama The Favourite about two foxy court mistresses' (Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone) unofficial competition to become 'the favourite' of the Queen of England (Olivia Colman) in the early 1700s is so rich in its production values and costumes, so melodious and non-anachronistic in its background score, so wild in its general writing, so highbrow in its dialogues, so highly qualitative in its humor lines, so fancifully breathtaking its three lead actresses are, and so bizarre in its camera work (the use of fisheye lens and pulley effect) that I almost forgot about the proceedings that is as humdrum as a boring Sunday morning in this early 2000s.

Gone Girl," A Dark, Stimulating Thriller. ♦ 74%
","The book is always better than the movie. So, lets just go ahead of that.You will be discussing the movie for several hours after. You will regret you didn't read the book first and all your friends have. You will just wish not to have a person like one of those few main characters (of the movie) in your life. But, most essentially, you will hope YOU don't become like one of those. That is how dark and stimulating David Fincher's latest thriller Gone Girl is.It primarily shows how far we, as human beings have reached. Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), a jobless writer finds one morning that his over-indulgent wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) is missing. The motor starts making noise just after that, as skeletons start falling from the cupboard, from the heater, from inside the bed, from the warehouse, from a jar in the kitchen, from the tiny nail cavity. Soon we learn what marriage can do to people, if not handled properly. It reminded me of several fictional stories which say that the tiniest matters the most. Imagine the wife Amy as an evolved version of YOURSELF. With few doses of insanity, discipline, and sociopathy.It throws light at the ranges of sanity and insanity in the world, all at the same time. You may not feel for the characters much after what they do to themselves, but it does become sumptuous food for thought for us. Would you be able to carry out any similar things like those shown in the film? Perhaps not. Gillian Flynn has written a contemporary story about marriage, delusion, and sweet (or bitter) revenge.Fincher has added the right ingredients in the adaptation, and I am truly impressed with Trent Reznor's score. At the same time, he has missed certain points; the result being a whole different recipe. Gone Girl falls in black comedy genre, which disappoints me. Yeah, add humor, lots of it, but when its proportion surpasses that of the main theme, things go wrong. The book is equally comic if not more, but it never mixed, the hard and soft.I am in awe with Ben Affleck. His air is fabulous and now I cannot think of any other actor for the role. From that smile in the trailers to his nuanced actions - they all so blend nicely with the story, oh, I cannot stop praising him and helping him chafe the highly earned prejudice off. Rosamund Pike is the showstopper. She is perfect as Amazing Amy. Her eyes spoke all that Flynn might have wanted to convey through the silver. Perry and Harris both are good. Carrie Coon is better.The score makes you want more, but I am upset they didn't use any track except BOC's 'The Reaper'; the screenplay may not be the best but it suited. Fincher directs his cast brilliantly. The art department has to be lauded for creating a gleam ambiance that fits with the plot. Overall, the film has been handled averagely well with respect to the book.BOTTOM LINE: May not be THE film of the year, but definitely the thriller of the year. A person MUST watch the film and indulge in the character's insanity, for it will be a difficult affair to experience it in real life. Go ahead and experience no-frilled insanity.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOTIP: If possible, watch it anywhere but India, for the censorship ruins the film.",7,1,11,4 November 2014
Django Unchained," The New Film By Quentin Tarantino Is His Magnum Opus... Or Is It?
","Before you go to watch the stalwart's new film, brace yourselves for some ultra gore and and true western extravaganza. Nothing - the trailer, posters, bloopers, scenes, screenshots - nothing actually defines this movie until you watch it. Django Unchained is a masterpiece!Now, when you take up such a beloved topic like 'REVENGE' then you ought to know that it will entertain you. And when big fishes like Tarantino, Morricone, DiCaprio, Waltz, Jackson & Foxx are a part of it, it's a blockbuster. The soundtrack is mind-blowing, editing realistic and direction par excellence. Django Unchained is a masterpiece!The plot is very simple but the way you predict it will shame you because in here nothing happens like we think, guess or comprehend. Every scene after one will spark your mind constantly and will please you. The screenplay is not non-linear but the flashbacks will make you scream in pure entertainment joy, of course! Django Unchained is a masterpiece!Scenes of shotgun firing, blood clots, boom-baam-boom, scream, growl, Leo's shouts, Waltz's pleasing conversation style, Jamie's ultra-uber gait and his expressions will make you go crazy. And the timing of evergreen songs will just mesmerize you. The violence scenes are gory, cold-blooded and aptly put at the right time so that you indulge more into it. And the western antebellum era makes it more enduring. Django Unchained is a masterpiece!DiCaprio's vindictive portrayal of the ruthless plantation owner may not be his best (and his screen time is low as I had expected), but I could compare him with Depp for the characterization. Christoph Walt is charming, straightforward and pure genius while Kerry Washington totally complements the whole cast with her countenances. Django Unchained is a masterpiece!Now, I could talk talk and talk or maybe write a book about my experience in native hospital but to end this review I have to admit I was amazed by the story, and I have to say I cried a tear during it. Love is in the air and I believe revenge is the sweetest thing, provided you succeed. Django Unchained is a masterpiece!QT's best was Pulp Fiction but this could be if it wasn't too violent but I think it the violence level wasn't Jedi her, it could've spoiled it. I was also a bit disappointed with the editing but that's okay. Hence, Django Unchained is a masterpiece, but not QT's magnum opus!Bottom Line: Watch the best movie of 2012/2013, because you can;t miss this one!

The Theory of Everything," Falls Just Short Of Being An Honest Biography. ♦ 70%
","As much as I dislike the title of this film for inappropriateness, I liked Eddie Redmayne's portrayal as Stephen Hawking. And the degree of both is just above average.Anthony McCarten may have had plenty of headaches while writing this romantic drama under the disguise of a biography, because how large a gimmick is the story, the same goes for director James Marsh in building the setup. They should've had gone back in time, defying their subject scientist's theory, and pondered upon how to create an adaptation of a memoir which seems partly biographical and mostly a novella. I haven't read the memoir and nor do intend to, but the main problem with this apparently inspiring film is that it focuses more on the personal lives of Professor Hawking and his ex-wife. While that be it, the thing that fuels this problem into a wildfire is that the audience think of it as just not a romantic drama (like the synopsis suggests), but actually an upright biography about the cosmologist.To an extent, even director James Marsh (whose Oscar-winning doc Man On Wire, about Philippe Petit's daredevil act, failed to gather traction, so Robert Zemeckis is making a film) tries to sweep it off as a romantic drama. The ounces of insights into the professor's study and his theories can be found only in the background, thus nullifying the whole shindig. As a romantic drama, I started loathing few characters, which if I disclose who may cause you to loathe me as well; characters who can be found in a string of romantic dramas over the past decades.As a biography, which it sometimes pretends to be, The Theory of Everything shuns science which is ironic. Eddie Redmayne is fabulous, although he may slip by with only an Oscar nod, maybe. Felicity Jones is sweet and so were the supporting characters, who would have had bigger roles to act if this were not a genre confusing tide.The cinematography is fine, and so is the music, the latter of which tries to support the apparent inspiration inducing characteristic I was talking about. All said and done, the film never quite bores you, always engaging us with short sequences that describe as to what really happened since 1963. Had they exploited 5 minutes of the 120 minute narration to explain his disease, I would have jumped up in my chair.BOTTOM LINE: The Theory of Everything is a non-self-deprecating drama that takes its viewers on a canoe-ride into the lives of the great Stephen Hawking and second-rate Jane Hawking. A drama so good and a biography so bad that if I wanted to learn about the scientist's theories, I would reread his books.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",7,1,1,11 December 2014

Dissolved in the stealthy modus operandi of surveillance in old Easy Germany, serious amorous relationship and the impact of the whole setup on a single man is what this talks about. And, well, it talks well.Pure layout, gorgeous writing and an even fine cinematography. Being a debut art by Donnersmarck, the adaptation of a serious thriller is very generic. The dialogs (subtitles) were quite good. The expressions by Ulrich Muhe & Martina Gedeck are exceptional. Sebastian Koch stays being genuine with me (after his Die Hard 5 performance). The overall filmmaking style is good. And the best part about the experience was the music, tingling at right times throughout the suspenseful storyline. No wonder, the Oscar.But, yes it goes haywire towards the midway which is why I term it as the flip-flop action.

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," The 2 Interpretations Of Extremes. ♦ 69%
","If I were a robot, I'd rate it a 6 because at the end of the film I would not perceive the feelings the film tries to convey that life is about dreaming, living and meeting each other. Before this movie, I did not know what LIFE magazine's motto was or worse they even had a motto. Just because it can be heavily related with the people of this era, Ben Stiller's TSLOWM is a marvel in itself.No doubt the cinematography, the CGI and the music are the best factors governing this adaptation into enchantment. I just loved the transition on-screen when the normality metamorphosed into wonder, dullness into extravaganza. The background, beat music aggravated my experience. Ben Stiller's countenance works fine, so does Kristen Wiig's; their chemistry seemed phony, though. Supporting cast is an apt lot.The first 10 minutes were enough to intrigue me. But later came the boring parts as to I still think why some scenes were incorporated as they had no real reason to be in there. They, matter-of-factly induced boredom. Then, towards the middle, the story goes abrupt and the main character suffers from originality and ends with a rather fine climax. The dialogs are funny and I could only realize later how the character transition is the brilliantly sketched main aspect of the whole movie.It was a visually stunning experience and I was overwhelmed by the idea of an underachiever doing wonders. The titles are brilliant and special appreciation for art department. It talks and teaches (a bit) on how to turn the tables around of a stupid, useless life. Thumbs up!Watch out for the intricacies, the implied humor, the songs (Arcade Fire & Junip) and the trip down memory lane with almost all famous LIFE magazine covers over the past years flashing between the shots.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended!

","Astounded by the facts, grueling scenes & short scripts between the sequences, I find myself in an awkward situation where instead of thinking about which movie to watch next, I am introspecting about the purpose of my life. Seriously, this film makes it a point that you get emotionally inspired.Steven Spielberg, as always, takes up a sensitive topic and carves it to perfection. Not taking in account the long running time (which is actually pretty fair) & the imbalance of narration, the story of Oskar Schindler saving a bunch of innocent Jews from the clutches of callous German Kommandants strikes a visual chord mentally, emotionally. The heart-aching depiction of cruelty on Jews, rampant corruption during World War, slavery & the magnanimity of Schindler, his friendship, his aura is all well filmed. The music almost backs it up, with wonderful screenplay & cinematography.Liam Neeson is terrific. I have always loved his performances; this one makes me respect him more & more. Ben Kingsley is very very good, especially with his demeanor. Supporting cast is amazing. In fact, the whole crew should get a standing ovation for the hard-work of digging up the facts. The final sequences made me cry.BOTTOM LINE: A 9.3/10 for this must-watch, characteristic film. One of the most emotionally touching films.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

A Quiet Place," Capsule Review: A Quiet Place (6 Stars)
","It's a wild concept, alright. A world where humans are hunted and ruthlessly killed by unknown blind creatures who seem to have ultra-sensitive ears and zero tolerance for sound. John Krasinski directs and acts in this emotional thriller that has been sugarcoated with a familial arc just to help it tug at your heart strings as you watch his character and his family of a wife and kids live their life while hiding from these creatures and working towards a future where everyone is wise. The lack of dialogues made A Quiet Place a splendid experience for me because like the creatures I hate noise. But the contrived drama - between Krasinski's character and his daughter - put me slightly off, which was later aggravated by the multiple holes in the plot. The biggest issue was the lack of insight - what are these creatures, where did they come from, and what exactly is their problem - because at one scene they seem to be tipped off even by the slightest noise and the next the characters are running with all their might (even though it's on sand). Non-heterogeneous sequences that make up A Quiet Place makes it an average watch, and a shorter one, thankfully. It could excite people who don't think while watching. Escapists will love this and rave about this. Rumor has it they still do it on Reddit. TN.",6,0,0,18 August 2018

That's it.Following the story of an affluent businessman, it talks about a game his brother asks him to play & finds himself ending up in the wrong places. The journey is entertaining per se. And the audience are in a state of wanting for more. Just then, you are shown the climax & the pieces start falling into puzzle. Yes, it does convery a message or prove a point, but a mild conclusion is just not what I was expecting & it played against the effect it had so wonderfully tailored in my mind.

","The most crucial, entertaining and amazing time period in this movie of over 150 minutes is from 110th minute to 130th minutes. Rest is just too lazy. Because if the film starts, it is too lazy to stop.Day-Lewis has done a wonderful job and I believe this is his best. Sally Field just complements the husband-wife pair. Spielberg chooses to be more of a verbal in this rather than the remaining aspect as compared to his other masterpieces. Music is sharp, screenplay adaptation is better, so is the photography. But, the modern and ancient flaw is to mediocre to find. But it sure grabs some brownie points over the history and research.Niceties have been taken care of and that is what matters if you are to make a movie on Abraham Lincoln.

Big Hero 6," Makes Nerds Look Cool. ♦ 60%
","I enjoy animation movies not because they help us dive back into our childhood memories as cartoons, but because they often speak volumes about world issues. While Big Hero 6 doesn't particularly point at any issue, it may inspire children to embrace science and technology.It is basically a superhero film and as all superhero films go, it says almost one and the same thing. A bunch of heroes with powers defeat the villain. Period. In here, the story revolves around a teen who takes the help of his friends and a robot to avenge his brother's death.The bot Baymax is very adorable and children will love it. It is the only new thing that managed to intrigue me. How 14-year-olds manage to invent hybrid technological marvels is beyond my understanding, and that is why I do not appreciate the friendship of East & West here. The Japanization troubled me a little. The plot is about robotics, science, and ideas. Its audience will stay spellbound at how marvelously the writers have added color and creativity in the story. With a great comic timing, Big Hero 6 keeps you engaged on a thread.The chief issue it addresses is that of the perils of technology and how everything is based in the programming. The film, as a whole, makes nerds, an ilk mocked by many, look cool. It is nicely directed, has great sound effects, good score, and brilliant art setup.But, too bad, Big Hero 6 struggles with its clichés. The story goes literally unbelievable sometimes and slightly jumps the line as it starts its narration. Visuals effects reminded me of Spider-Man 3 and if you stop and think for a moment after the climax, the whole shindig looks like a goofy, child's play.BOTTOM LINE: Of course not the best animation movie of the year.

The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Heart-Rending Take On What & How War IS For Children. ♦ 97%
","I had heard so much about it, and after experiencing Schindler's List, The Lives Of Others & other Nazi-related motion pictures, here I am.Very subtle, the film starts off with wonderful music which stays till the end. I could even say that the tuneful music is the best part. In the same lines, the story takes off. How a lively kid, away from his friends, enclosed in a Nazi mansion tries to find solace in his newly found friends who also happen to intrigue him. This, as a result, creates ripples in the family. And eventually, things turn ugly.What the makers have done here with adaptation is that they have given ample time to create character depths. Their auras are well-defined, mostly because we know the war time. The cinematography is excellent, with least to no anachronisms. I was stunned by the performance of the lead boys. Vera Farmiga is terrific, as always. The whole shebang looks very good.It simply tells a moving story and makes us abhor the war more and more and the climax will make you turn on the waterworks. The most ruthless Nazi movie to come out in the last decade. Wonderful. 9.7!BOTTOM LINE: You cannot miss this one. Highly Recommended.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Brave," Not Pixar's Best!
","Could've done better is what I can say about this magical journey. Brave could've been made better if the metamorphosis to the bear was not shown. Yet I enjoyed the triplet brothers' innocence, the king's innocuous non- kingliness and the bear's stupidity.Well, the story is pretty clean except that of the magical wand. It is little hard to digest the thing about the fate; the way it is depicted conversely with the notion. Well, in an unorthodox speak, Brave seems to have adopted paradigm shift towards the end. 6 out of 10 it is.Bottom line: Every Pixar fan must watch it!

Guardians of the Galaxy," Adds Humour To Heroism. ♦ 73%
","Come on now, we all know (and pretend that we don't) that all superhero movies are alike. But we still go and see them and come out of the hall enthralled by the visual effects, stunts, 3D, et cetera. So let me not focus on the story here, but the things that entertained me.To start with, I'm in complete awe with Chris Pratt. His brief dance performance is what kick-starts the films and continues to keep us hooked with his character, the main hero. Next, I found myself laughing and grinning all the way through 2 hours because of the large amounts of humor that this film succeeds in executing. Every single sequence is painted with a comic tint, thanks to Cooper, Bautista and others. I have no reason to blame the cast, nor the production unit.Here in India, there were few cuts that annoyed me but I believe we were spared more than we were in The Wolf of Wall Street.While I thought that the CGI was a tad premature at some parts, the story is narrated quite nicely. The action sequences are not much of a surprise as it showcases the futuristic gadgets and stuff. There aren't any twists that could have saved the second half from being a little itchy.Coming to the best part: the soundtrack. The Pina Colada song never felt so good before and it was also years since I heard that. Right kind of music used at perfect times throughout the film. Vin Diesel's Groot voice needs a pat in the back.Guardians of the Galaxy succeeds in holding the Marvel Cinematic Universe as it conveys few implications here: that tree life is so much more significant than we think. It touches topics like space and gravity and galaxies and science and stuff superficially, although stops right there when it introduces typical superhero formula of an ancient ball that has some celestial power and the heroes and the villains are behind it. Blah blah blah.BOTTOM LINE: A typical superhero film, embezzled with good humor, great music and an unconventional character ensemble.

Evil Dead," That Routine Bloodbath. ♦ 39%
","The story is previously seen in over 100 movies. Thank God, it does not turn into a comedy.Starting off with some serious spine-chilling sequences, it succeeds in creating suspense. Then, the evil comes into the picture & acts dumb. A witchcraft book is the medium between the perpetrators & the victims (of course, there has to be at least one). The evil has immense powers like entering into bodies through improbable cavities, closing & opening doors with finesse & playing mind games to name a few. The climax is a blunder of dialog, main thematic idea & CGI.Cast is fine while I am impressed with the score & editing. Screenplay works fine, too. What not impresses are, unfortunately, the foundation blocks. Although, it tries hard to entertain in the first half, second half is filled with bloodbath (literally) & some uncomfortable scenes; relief it does not focus on flesh show.Is it clichéd? Yes. Is it frightening? Yes. Is it predictable? No. Is it usual? Yes. Hence, 3.9/10.BOTTOM LINE: Nothing new to be found.

Uri: The Surgical Strike," One-Line Review: Uri (6 Stars)
","Even though I am still wondering the point of Uri, a self-boasting, anti-cantankerous film based on actual events, it did not cross my mind till before the second half when I was honestly enjoying Aditya Dhar's superior craft of war and its storytelling as he gives into the dreamy requirements of every patriotic cinema enthusiast in an action film where Pakistan again plays the bad element for the nth time and Vicky Kaushal moves to the next level of stardom.

Prisoners," A Mind-Numbing Experience! ♦ 86%
","It took me few minutes of thought to finally realize the implication and the meaning of the title. What would've been a pleasant experience of a crime investigation story about abductors, turned out to be a mind- numbing experience, thanks to the writers for instilling the little details of life values.Jake Gyllenhall is very good as a cop, but Hugh Jackman steals the limelight and proves he's more than meets the eye (Wolverine?). Supporting cast is good and Paul Dano is just terrific with what was given to him. There is nothing new about the story, in itself. But then it evolves into something bigger & thankfully DEEPER, which is the only reason it stands out. Other factors that sweep the experience into a great thing are the refined & genius music, fine cinematography & a brilliant direction. The period attribute is critically thought-upon and serves the main strong-point. How families react when a member disappears is shown on a larger scale.The character study is also a point to be noted while you watch. Certain elements in the film could've be done without because the confuse more than they adhere. Except that I thought the editing could've been more strict, Prisoners is another great experience of the year. Kudos to the crew!BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended!

","So, I don't know what's up with the monster-themed animation movies last year - Frankenweenie, ParaNorman & Brave (slightly monstrous). But, of them all I purely enjoyed HT as it makes you laugh, emote, cry and think!Frankly speaking, the plot is different and simple, direction is amazing. After all Dexter's Laboratory was epic. Screenplay is great and the animation is just tad excellent! I must appreciate the Sony production for a fantastic outline and for using large amounts of sarcasm. I enjoyed all the satirical takes on various elements. And this movie works as parallel universe - an amazing topic!It talks about the Father factor and how he strives to protect her; on the other hand the daughter's take on how he behaves and even though it is set in imaginary parallel universe - the values, virtues and principles are similar to the human psychology. Enjoyed it!I never really got bored while watching this and even though I knew what the Dracula wanted for her daughter, the plot still intrigued me. I wonder why it was not AMPAS nominated.

Elysium," There Are Many Things I Liked, Except The Film As A Whole. ♦ 62%
","So intriguing the first instances of the film I sat there anticipating one hell of a dystopian flick. Jodie Foster entered the scene and I knew how the film would turn out.Starting off the depiction of a beautiful, futuristic planet-kinda place called Elysium, the plot speaks about a kid's dream to go and live there. As Earth is (evidently) running low on basic amenities & high on population & toxins & radiations, this new place is a refuge. The weapons, the instrument, the medical healer and the trans-human theme are so interesting I was gob-smacked at the pure charm of 'em. But, then an idiotic, self-destructive drama coils in which not only pops unanswered questions but also makes the whole setup look foolish.Not speaking about plot holes, Elysium doesn't pay attention to its characters as the second part tries to act smart and dives into a confusing state of blunder. Faux pas in movies, that is what Elysium is.Although, the concepts and the ideas are worth watching over a fine screenplay of 100 minutes. The action scenes are sumptuous. And there was no need to touch the whole shebang with romance, thereby creating unnecessary emotion.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for a one-time watch!",6,0,1,26 December 2013
Taken," The Usual Kidnap Plot Blessed With Panache. ♦ 86%
","From the start, the characters are baked into genuineness. Then, the fast-paced action-play takes over to give its viewers the extraordinary experience which any other film with similar plot fails to deliver.Liam Neeson is my new favorite in the action genre, with his performance outstanding. His physique, his demeanor, his air - all add up as icing for the action cake. The plot & story is clichéd, but what adds glitters to it is its execution. No leeway is provided by the writers, keeping it tightened, with short-flashbacks of how the sequence previously mentioned must have occurred. Brilliant fight sequences & relationships bonds makes it a wonderful, edge-of-the-seat watch.Mostly, it works due to the emotion involved and the experience totally pulls you in, forcing you to want to be inside the movie and for men, to want to be Neeson's tough CIA character.BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended 'cause there aren't many movies with such impeccable standards. No viable plot-holes as such.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Frank," The Quirkiness Is Inadequate. ♦ 41%
","So before you realize that the paper mâché head thing is not a gimmick, you will have to relish the fact that Frank tells a story about a dysfunctional rock band whose members defy synergy. Each one of them is self-obsessed, giving rise to an inexplicable method of event- unfolding of the X-gen rock music scene.Michael Fassbender as the titular character is great, as he leads the band into darkness. They don't covet fame nor money as is implied in a lot of sequences. It is unclear what they want, except that they want to create music and miserably fail at it. The band members talk and contradict, and everybody wants to be like Frank or be with him.The whole psychology of an eccentric band is hackneyed. While a guy who aspires to be a great musician, who is himself obsessed with social media, tries his hand at joining this so-called band, we, as an audience, are fed with crumbs of tomfoolery. The final stretch will make you barf, if at all you survive the numbness of the thematic captivation of Irish woods. Death is handled clumsily in the plot and so is music.While I am impressed with the direction, photography, special effects, and editing, I stayed unimpressed with the story throughout 90 minutes.BOTTOM LINE: With deadpan music swaying in the air, Frank is a phonetic tale of madness told through the eyes of a musician whose realization that he has landed somewhere he doesn't belong serves as a boring climax. Quirkiness is, hence, not enough. You may try skimming through it if you get a free copy.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",4,3,8,2 December 2014
The Artist," In The Music, Lies The Gold. ♦ 71%
","The story of The Artist has been captured on reel since time immemorial. And I cannot fail to mention how clichéd it look when it became the most awarded French cinema. That being said, the music soundtrack is one bomb- shell kind of a factor which solely wins the situation.Throughout the 100 minutes of melodrama about how a silent film actor goes down the line, the music stays to entertain. The highs & the lows of the orchestra and the crescendos induce sheer hearing pleasure to the rather hackneyed plot. And about the performances, Jean Dujardin got what he deserved. Such flawless acting with pinch of dance moves is a sure charm. The actress did very well, too. John Goodman supports well.As a whole, it gives a cool vintage projection for people who are more into the trend-driven yesteryear movies. Recommended!",7,2,5,28 November 2013
Mama," An Straightforward Timid, Horror Story!
","This movie is scared in itself to scare people. It is scared to prove people wrong. The ghost is timid and a dumb spirit who doesn't understand the ethics of whatever world she's in because if the film- makers say that 'mother's love is forever,' she wouldn't just do what she did at the end.I don't know how the ghost became a ghost in the first place, nor does the Pan's Labyrinth makers try to tell us.I admit, it has its share of scary scenes, but what it does is - move you to an extent warning us of a scary scene and when the scene actually is executed, it doesn't make us scream. CGI does that to some level. After watching Mama and not mentioning Chastain's name will be a sin. She is emo-sexy in it, truly phenomenal from her ZD30 role and a great performer. The girls are cute and induce some thrills.But to be frank, I just didn't enjoy watching Mama not just because it is tad lame, but also because the story is partially incomplete. The climax and some serious unanswered questions made me ridicule and write this review.BOTTOM LINE: Watch if for Chastain.

I was hypnotized.The animation has always been impeccable. But, what Up makes so special for me is the numerous number of life virtues inhibited in its sweet story. Wilderness, confidence, perseverance, love, humanity, wrongness & what-not, God! I am still stupefied by the panache. Although, the plot is set in improbable situations, I totally understand. It induces so much of emotions towards the end, it will affect you somehow.To live the moment without repenting, to find happiness in every thing you do. To live loving others. To be adventurous. To not lose heart at the time of death. Up teaches you that, if you've forgotten. 'Carpe Diem!' that is what Up shouts at you, with a voice of a nightingale. Music is cute.The characters are so lively & genuine I can relate to them. And the humor just adds to the fun. The innocence of elderly & young, the adventure theme, and the underlying message is all worth to be considered. High priority. A great 9.6/10.BOTTOM LINE: No alibis for missing this.

But I loved Denzel Wahsington's charismatic performance as a detective. He steals the limelight for sure. His character scores massive points, but Owen's character's got depth and anonymity. Jodie Foster has the cleverest dialogs while Christopher Plummer was a disgrace (I don't know.. either his character or portrayal - something went nasty). The makers have made it a point to keep the viewers hooked to what they are showing on the screen with witty dialogs, humor, action & serious plot. Indeed, more than meeting my expectations... it surprised.The opening song surprised me. Well, being an Indian, it was a matter of pride. Although, I should reprimand the selection of that particular song; was an inept thing to do for a crime thriller like this. Yes, it involves great thinking to churn out what is happening on screen, but as it enhances... the plot gets even more confusing. That troubled me. Lots of implications & unanswered questions plastered over heavy political jargon... well, it is too cryptic. Although, on a second watch, everything got clear. 8.0/10.Mighty thinking of changing the idea of the whole bank-robbery thing. Quite an intuitive take.

Jack Reacher," Action Packed Thriller With Traces Of Amateurism!
","You wouldn't believe Tom Cruise is 50 years old after you watch this adrenaline-pumping, car-smashing, action thriller worth a wonderful watch! The performances & the direction are the two best things in Jack Reacher.Except for three sequences which made no sense at all to me, I enjoyed the partially-defined plot. Screenplay is good and the sound effects just add the spins up. Action stunts are very good and so are the fights though there is suspicion mounting over the origin of these sequences. Rosamund Pike is genuine while the supporting cast is average in portraying their characters. I should mention Rovert Duvall for his stand-off act.A story slightly different and difficult to construe, Jack Reacher makes an enjoyable watch with many things left to viewer's imagination including the main plot point. And the climax made the lead character go haywire & stereotyped. Locations are good and some things reminded me of the DIE HARD series. Yet, the humor involved, I personally believe played spoilsport with the genre.BOTTOM LINE: Even if you are not a TC fan, watch it for the chills.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

","Les Misérables being my first Les Miz experience as well as my first ever musical cinema experience turned out to be amazing.The story is great and in parallel to the 19th century French era which is one of my few areas of interest. The intricacy at which the script revolves around the lead characters and some trivial plot kings is marvelous and unlike Cloud Atlas blunder, everything gels here to bring out a perfect musical.Hugh Jackman is great, so is Russell Crowe but I didn't like Hathway much, maybe because of a personal whim since I saw The Princess Diaries. Anyways, I also think Amanda Seyfried and her reel-life lover were sidelined and that instead of Sacha & Carter having their names in the promotional posters, I would've wanted their names to come up. Well I am no marketing executive..Music is exceptional and choreography is good, too. The lyrics of the pieces are just so true and extraordinary that I fell in love with the verses - of all aspects.Bottom line is that even though it just tries very hard to complete the story in about 150 minutes, Les Misérables is a perfect blend which you can enjoy with your family!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Capsule Review: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
","If repetitive chase sequences, contrived colorful explosions at the end of every action sequence, and occasionally forced and isolated comedy are the only parameters that you judge a superhero movie in 2017 with, then Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 should be a collector's product. There's a lot of references in this film that demands you go back to Vol. 1 and also take a 50-hour pop culture lesson narrated by Stan Lee. The plot associated with Walkman-ambassador leader guardian Quill's parentage is a boring cliché and one that makes you puke, considering there are more grotesque beings and objects in the film. A sheer lack of novelty, the inability to improve the charm in the characters, and reckless usage of CGI majorly affects James Gunn's second major feature film that is gaudier than the film's obnoxious poster. Chris Pratt has begun to slightly annoy and if he maintains a similar air we'll have to turn to DC by the time these guardians create the next volume. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an ordinary superhero film with lots of blabbering using advanced vocabulary and lots of flashes, lasers, flares, and plasma. It also has a gold-obsessed priestess awkwardly trying to get at the guardians for stealing a bunch of her Duracell batteries. Like this, there are many more mindless arcs, but I'm fairly content because Quill was finally introduced to Microsoft Zune, arguably one of the best music players to come out of the technology race.

The Shape of Water," Molecule Review: The Shape of Water
","I'm unable to adjudge whether it is the outstanding performance of the cast or the brilliant narration of the love story that pushes The Shape of Water to the level of a classic. But I'm certainly able to call it one not because of its critical reception but because of what it aims to highlight and succeeds. Guillermo del Toro's protagonist is a mute, young woman named Elisa (Sally Hawkins) who plans to save a mystical human-like amphibian from the clutches of a government-run scientific research institute where she works, and which is managed by a sadist and unscrupulous ex-Army (Michael Shannon). It is her love and sympathy for the creature that motivates to do what she does, but Toro projects it as a connection between two creatures with their own flaws and shortcomings. The Shape of Water is purely a love story and nothing else, narrated in the classic 80s style which only uplifts its appeal. Hawkins is Godlike, but I'm without words at the impeccable performance of Richard Jenkins, Shannon, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Octavia Spencer who play more than life. They are so intricate and IN the character that more than the otherwise bland love story I was impressed by their natural skills. Together with Alexandre Desplat's melodious background score and a fitting production setup that puts James Cameron's Avatar (2009) into shame, the film goes above and beyond as to what it sets to achieve. Which is why I will recommend it to anyone who's familiar with Toro's filmography and those who simply appreciate good cinema. The Shape of Water is good cinema and we must appreciate it.

Zero Dark Thirty," If You Need A Synonym Of What You Believe What Happened, Watch 0 Dark 30
","The first half is boring, heavy on writing and full of torture as you might have heard. It is full of technicalities which might be pretty hard to perceive. But Jessica Chastain is mind-blowing and real in this pompous, predictable and easy thriller. The first half deals with more of details and is a precise stuff of how it all started since 9/11 to 2010.Coming to the second half is where you move your head closer to the screen. Of what I have heard and watched over 2011 & 2012 in Reuters, BBC, TOI, NatGeo - if you add them up - you get ZDT. It is not action packed as it states but surely is a thriller. Music is typicality, and this is not much of a absolute 'The Hurt Locker' type film-making. Kathryn disappoints a lil bit because the astronomical expectations were not answered well.The problem with ZDT is that you know what will happen and that oozes 50% of the fun of it. But, still the intricacy and accuracy of this movie (as they say) is worth appreciable. The remaining cast is par excellence and the people who worked as Seal team need a couple of claps.What I liked about the movie is secrecy that they do not show the minutiae of how, why and when about the operation. One minute you see them in the Langley room/White House and the next second you see two 'canaries.' Second thing is the Quentin Tarantino type narration with titles for scene like 'Human Error'! I felt it is pretty awesome.Overall experience after watching ZDT is ridiculously average and non-zealous compared to the SEAL TEAM 6: The Raid On Osama bin Laden which released in the 2012 beginning by NatGeo or The Hurt Locker or any similar kinds. But it is recommendable, although I cannot guarantee the enjoyment. As cinema, ZDT fails down and under. But as a documentary of how things get done in certain field of high-tech operation, this is straight must-watch!Bottom Line: If you haven't ANY idea about the OsamaBL raid (read or watched or operated, ha ha) go for it!WATCH OUT FOR: Jessica Chastain!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? 80% YESLanguage: Strong | Sex: No | Nudity: Mild | Violence: Very Strong | Gore: Very Strong | Smoking, Alcohol, Drugs: No",6,18,40,5 January 2013

12 Years a Slave," Gripping Tale Told For The nth Time. ♦ 61%
","And this is why I did not like Oldboy's remake in the first place. Not that 12 Years A Slave is anyway applicable as a remake, but I do not understand why a simple predictable story comes as a brilliant epitome of cinematic masterpiece to everyone.Chiwetel Ejiofor is marvelous as the main protagonist and chances are he may sweep the Oscar. So he is kidnapped and sold as a slave is a heart- wrenching story. His antebellum days of slavery reminded me of Django Unchained's & The Help's setup, which in turn oozed out the newness from it. I have read, watched all about the blacks-whites discrimination, but setting your story (which is a true story, for Chrissakes) and retelling it is quite mainstream.Maybe the fuss is about the score, which is mind you, amazing by Hans Zimmer. Michael Fassbender is charming, as well. Steve McQueen's direction is terrific, all right. But cinematography like zooming into people's noses just won;t catch my fancy. The 2 hours was never boring and thus, a humble 6.1/10. And it was quite emotional to feel the characters' pain. A fine work, anyway.BOTTOM LINE: Term it a masterpiece? No. That won't come from me. It may sweep few Oscars for the costume, the setup, the performances, but as a film, it does not ring a bell in my critical point of view. Because I am tired of this setup and retelling of them antebellum/slavery days.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

There Will Be Blood," Bag Of Implications. ♦ 63%
","Paul Thomas Anderson is a master in filmmaking, no doubt. His 'The Master' made me look into his filmography.The direction is good, screenplay simple and narration healthy. But, the plot will confuse you throughout of what is being heavily implied. The first half is narration of a rags-to-riches story. And even there, some elements are half-baked. Second half is violent, cruel, anti-religious & totally baffling. Decrypting the climax isn't a child's play either. How & why the characters are falling in those sequences were beyond my grasping quotient, so I can't really say much about it. But, you know PTA!Daniel Day-Lewis is fantastic, but I really think he over-acted towards the end. Paul Dano is better, although his character was ill-conceived. Dillon Freasier fails to impress.Music is very good & ingenious. I loved the melodious & instrumental music. Mainly when it catches up during some intense scenes. Very good. Wonderful setup, rhetoric dialogs & fervid acting - that is what this aggressive film is all about. Some sequences will take you by surprise & will stay with you forever. A good 6.3/10!BOTTOM LINE: I will not recommend this to a casual cinema-holic, as I do of all PTA films.

Whiplash," A 'Very Good Job.' ♦ 75%
","When jazz and cinema go for a date together, it usually ends with bitterness. While in Damien Chazelle's Whiplash the date goes fine, there still remains gaps that could've been filled.The story of how an overly disciplined jazz instructor Fletcher (J K Simmons) uses severe admonishment to push the abilities of a drummer Andrew (Miles Teller) who he thinks has the potential to make it great strikes its audience as a parable. Andrew tries normal ways to become a good drummer, but his meeting with ruthless Fletcher narrows his focus and inspires him in a manner we only find in prodigy stories. The film talks about the arduous path to success through a jazz setting, which helps in the recommendation process: people who enjoy jazz music will derive more pleasure from Whiplash.The film focuses on cussy tutelage and frames it as a necessity in the field of pedagogy. While it also throws light on how evolved the music industry has presently become, we do not fail to realize that strict teaching is what begets great musicians. Factors like perseverance, struggle, grit, and passion are heavily sampled and one may even grade the film as inspirational.J K Simmons is well-directed, and with his bald cranium, he easily handles the authoritarian air. Miles Teller's hard work is splashed everywhere and one stands and wonders the sheer brilliance with which he portrays the role. His subtle romance, his mild introspections, his familial negligence - all are done so well as the story picks up the gradual pace. While I can vote for Teller to be rising star of 2014, I don't see an Oscar. Simmons should receive the Best Supporting.Camera work is another best thing about Whiplash. It points and emphasizes on things that hold importance in a specific frame. It moves and focuses and fades with absolute charisma. Overall direction is good. Writing hits few bumps but they are negligible. Editing is very precise as is evident in the final sequence which reaches crescendo both with respect to the music playing and the movie itself. The teachings in the first half suspends its audience as we anticipate every following actions of the characters. While the story doesn't necessarily take a route that we expect, there is delight in every route it tries. Because jazz. Music is atmospheric.There are times that we feel all the admonishing goes over the line and the story to be a gimmick. Damien fails to draw a line between reality and strange fiction. Ounces of madness here and there makes it an engaging watch. But, it crosses the invisible line and surrounds some frames, causing a mess.Cinematography and editing may get the nods, but Best Picture looks far fetched.BOTTOM LINE: Whiplash is brilliant and hard-hitting. It inspires its audience to stop dilly-dallying and go beyond one's own abilities and with drumming, the most laborious music art, it succeeds in conveying the message.

The Wolf of Wall Street," A Maddeningly Ferocious Genre Of Cinema. ♦ 70%
","This is not black comedy, this is utter boldness. It climbs on your body and takes hold of your whole damn face and then barks on your ears, flashes on your eyes & talks sitting on your mouth. This is cinema at its most vulnerable phase, harnessed to tell a story which cannot be told in any other possibly charismatic way.Martin Scorsese has fascinated me with his themes and not his works themselves; he finds details in the simplest story & barfs it into hell of a script. With The Wolf..., he does the same. Telling a story was not enough, so he extrapolates. The life & times of a maverick stockbroker told from all points of view. There is nudity, sex, drugs, porn, society, money, business, animals, wild human beings and genius. 3 hours of maddeningly extraordinary tale of a person concludes to a magnificent climax and that is what I loved about it the most, the climax.The performances are immense and intense. Leonardo DiCaprio is hands down, a phenomenal actor. Jonah Hill has catapulted his power & career to the space. Supporting cast is excellent. The music is good but I am not happy with the editing, which could've been more tight had they given attention to the post-processing.But, the question is do we need such hybrid boldness to depict something so simple? It solely depends on the watcher. I for one got bored at some point in the film with all the shenanigans the mischief machines do during the second half, but the humor kept me hanging there. It also is factor to consider that when you observe closely, it talks nothing new as such. So, with a brilliant screenplay, what does it achieve? Maybe send a message? Nope. The message is already conveyed by some other movie. All it does is imbibe audacity into the themes of power, money, corruption & sex. But I appreciate what the makers have done to give respect to the talent of Jordan Belfort.BOTTOM LINE: Everyone should give this a try & think for themselves how it can be analyzed as a cinema & where it stands aesthetically & culturally. For movie buffs, this is a good 3-hour noon show. Nothing more.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Story is not pretty straightforward and the plot revolved around what I call is sweet, because the movie-watching experience doubles as things gel to John McClain as they do to you unless you are a smart-ass.

The Conjuring," Too Feeble To Be Scary. ♦ 48%
","This is just the right theater movie material. But if you are a real horror fanatic & have been following the genre for long, The Conjuring will only disappoint you.Because, the plot starts with a believable story of two sisters and how a husband-wife pair of exorcists/conjurers solve the mystery. Now, the character depth is very shallow here, telling stories in binds and thus reaching no conclusion whatsoever. Then comes the family who are threatened by a dumb spirit, who is so unbelievable that she persuades the mother of the family to kill others.. So pathetic.And, the turn of events isn't justified at all. Some even seemed made- up.Vera Farmiga is excellent and the guy who I last saw in Watchmen (2009) supports well. The family's performance is below average and since they were made to enact improbable situations, I wouldn't expect much. Yes, in a horror movie improbable situations are feasible, but there is a doll in here with some serious life issues who seems to only follow what the director says appearing wherever she wants to be without realizing what she's doing. How wonderful!Finally, the ending is so calm, I thought it was a drama. Ranging over a fine 2 hours, it does have some moments which made my jaw drop, but then they all were referenced (from The Amityville Horror & Paranormal Activity). Cinematography & setup is par excellence and it is due to the filmmaking factors that I rate it a humble 4.8 out of 10. Although, I still am depressed with the writers for lacking originality. Sampling the much-loved exorcism with a tint of relationships & emotions does not culminate in anything.BOTTOM LINE: Not recommended.

","Wonder why it didn't give into the jinx. There are lots of reasons why Taken 2 is not an inch near Taken, but if we look at it individually, it is not that bad either. At least, it isn't worth all the rants.Liam Neeson himself confesses he is getting tired of it all and it seems true with his lousy air.Women in here are terrific actors. Although the plot slips into unbelievability lots of times, it does give out something called as 'lukewarm entertainment.' Locations are good, chases are good, action sequences are good & most of all, the dialogs are still pretty fine for a sequel.Since it doesn't have a single surprise event & all can be easily predicted from the start, Taken 2 doesn't live up to the expectation. And I hear it worked well at the BO and chances are Taken 3 will be in the same line. All I can say is Taken was a brilliant thriller and we shouldn't attach the sequels to it.

But, if you are an X-Men follower there are two things you may wanna watch out, once it comes out in rentals: the thing they do with Logan & the post-credit scene.Starting off with a bearded Hugh Jackman, the plot takes you back to the Nagasaki bombing. We know he is immortal; lands up in Japan and gets entangled in a series of ridiculous action sequences, I suspect, which were voluntarily. Then, we have few Japanese women he befriends and manages to go beyond, which makes no sense at all for a character so harsh & bold. The climax is a cheap attempt at a twist which hardly works for the movie. Other characters were poorly directed and the scene they acted in gave me an impression of unfathomable continuity. The villainy lacks vindictiveness. Trust me, the 2 hours of monotony just leads to you-know-what!And there is not much of the visual effects to write about. Action sequences are very good, but come on, now we require something inventive and spine-chilling. Probably the worst installment.BOTTOM LINE: Not recommended if you are conscious about your wallet.

If you agree with the previous two statements, then Identity should be the next movie you watch.Riddled with amazing performances and character building, Identity starts off dull. Then, it tells the story of 10 people who get stranded in a motel perfectly through co-incidence and while the camera flashes the cause of events, you'll give it a wry smile. What unfolds is a series of mystery-filled occurrences which are enough to keep you hooked. The scientific/medical approach also polishes it and moreover paints the errors off the plot which mainly focuses on crime- investigation.

Saving Mr. Banks," A Pleasing Tale Involving Creative Minds. ♦ 87%
","Because each and every character in this motion picture reflects creativity towards the audience, through their dialogs and actions. Not to mention, with one of the best cast ensemble this year (only second to American Hustle), Saving Mr. Banks is one of the best movies of 2013.I actually could relate to P L Travers' anxiety over Walt Disney's idea of animating her novels into a musical. Her past, connected to the mystical stories she wrote is bound together seamlessly with the present proceedings. Her childhood and her admiration for her father is one part, Disney's coaxing for the movie rights is another. In the end, they speak hell of a story which samples life, disorders, emotions and desolation. Coming out as a conclusion is that you always have to let go, no matter what.Emma Thompson is the star of the film. I won't speculate about the Oscars, but the way she carries her air as Mrs. Travers is mind-blowing. How she insists upon her co-characters about almost everything are the best conversations you'll hear this year-end, mostly when she makes us wanna hate and love her at the same time. Tom Hanks looks like he had 467 tans before his scenes and I think her very well attributed to the role. Special mention for Colin Farell (amazing), Bradley Whitford (charismatic), Jason Schwartzman (genuine) & Paul Giamatti (a different role well done) with B J Novak (slender).The best sequences of the lot are the musical ones where Whitford, Schwartzman and Novak sing, dance and thus try to cajole Thompson. Terrific!I appreciate Hancock's imagination and bringing in the details and paying careful attention to them; including the disorders of Walt Disney is one thing. I cannot go fact-checking, but intrinsically, the long list of messages this film conveys is sufficient for consideration (both awards and viewing). And it is incredibly pleasing; never bores.Fantastic music and score, supportive supp. cast, brilliant art setup and a clever cinematography makes this 2013's best comedy drama.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended!

","Starting off with the pleasantries, the plot dives into something deeper. And that thing is the suspense in the first half. In the second half, however, the suspense is something else. It is the job & fun of the viewers to find it out.James Stewart is amazing, but the antagonist in here is adorable & in the limelight. Performances are immense & I am in love with the dialogs, especially those delivered by Stewart's smart alecky finesse. Music is fine, so is the direction. Cinematography is exceptional as is usual in a Hitchcock movie.I cannot end this without mentioning that apart from crime & investigation & spying, large part of it deals with relationships, slapstick & heavy sarcasm which is, of course, a treat for eyes & ears.Being not an original work, I rate it a huge 8.6 out of 10 for the maximum entertainment. Although, I cannot dub this as the makers' best.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended. A wonderful suspense thriller with humor.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

The Truman Show," One Word: EPIC! ♦ 91%
","The first 20 minutes are boring and those consume the 9% of my rating aggregate. The remaining 80 minutes are EPIC.Starting off like any other drama film, The Truman Show talks about the story of an ordinary man. But, as the plot advances and as the character grows up, psychologically, things seem to take a reality check. Throughout the realization & final mission, you stick to your seat, most of your senses concentrating on what might happen next. Twists & turns start to come up and you stay mesmerized.Jim Carrey has won the Oscar, at least for me. His slapstick is improbable but funny. His portrayal is full of originality. Supporting cast act very well. Music symphonies provide a strong score and the screenplay just completes the classic.I can watch this more and more and still stay baffled at the unwinding of plot.

Happy New Year," An Unrehearsed Nonsense. ♦ 29%
","It all depends on what you expect. If rambunctious actors playing horse, wearing 100 different, colorful costumes, enacting a brainless heist is your definition of film, then you will be happy that you watched the film. Otherwise, you are in for a huge disappointment.It was unwise of me to be in the latter category. The film starts with Charlie (Shahrukh Khan), a nobody with an athletic body who is planning for 8 years now, to avenge his father's wrong incarceration by a hot-shot ignoramus (Shroff). Now as stupid as it might seem, he gathers a group of idiots (aka losers) to execute his plan which consists of many parts. The losers can be seen in the posters, but I will care to itemize them:► Tammy (Boman Irani) is the most annoying character in the whole film. With a voice improvisation that will make you wanna punch him in the face till it disfigures, he is an elderly stud who overacts and spoils the already botched attempt at making a film. Irani's worst performance.► Nandu Bhide (Bachchan Jr.) could be termed the most comic character by the audience with whom I watched the film because with every joke (all mindless, naive, and substandard), laughs sputtered as if an original stand-up comedy was being enacted. We aren't expecting much from Bachchan Jr. since after his Guru days, but drooping so low to make his fans to dissolve into laughter? Well, no one can help him. His performance makes his Idea commercials Oscar-worthy.► Rohan (Vivaan Shah) is a child who was only last month discontinued from breastfeed by his mum. With no acting skills at all or at least the ability to maneuver and make do without it (like Bachchan Jr.), he is a misfit here. Hasn't he inherited anything from his father?► Jag (Sonu Sood) is an explosive specialist turned body-builder out of the 2003 American hit film 'The Italian Job.' In fact, the whole film is relative to that film, which I guess Farah Khan didn't know, was brutally remade by Abbas-Mustan as 'Players.' She should've asked our Johnny-boy Bachchan Jr.. Sood is fine.Anyways, talk about performances and there is a competition happening among all the actors to come up with the worst performance. Consider Mohini (Deepika Padukone) who is a bar dancer with life values etched on to her. She cannot speak English and her disability is rampant in the film, helped by Bachchan Jr., which is the main cause of humor. SRK is fine, as well, but expecting more from him was my only mistake. He's grown old, but looks young both physically and mentally.The plot is as unoriginal as it can get. Borrowed from famous heist films, the first half blows. Traction builds up in the second half i.e. in Dubai where the actual heist takes place. The tens of dance performances, one unnecessary fight scene involving SRK, and loads of melodrama makes it a perfect family film by Farah Khan. The final scenes flash a lot of cliché and marks predictability. I have nothing special to say about Jackie Shroff, because he seemed like he played the role with only money (for the portrayal) in his mind.There are lots of junk comedy scenes that you may want to relish, but not a single sequence that evinces an emotion or a style or a film factor. Editing is hopeless and so is the screenplay. One scene involves a dance, while in the subsequent scene SRK is changing his 71st sunglasses. Music (Scott Choplin's The Entertainer used in a wrong context, Carl Douglas's Kung Fu Fighting, again used in wrong context; the fighters hardly use kung fu) and songs are the only thing that made me rate the film a 3, along with the slight effort that was made for the faintly funny dialogs.There are massive plot holes that if I start explaining will be longer than the reel of the film at 3 hours. But who even cares about these holes, when you know that the ship has already sunk. Towards the end, it looked like the makers didn't want it to end, slipping in unwanted parts of the film which may have been edited out previously. And the shindig ends with the typical way how a Farah Khan ends her films: the jokers who helped in making the film show their faces to get further embarrassed.BOTTOM LINE: It all depended on the direction, the torch bearer to bring out the performances in her actors, but after watching this 3- hour nonsense, I believe she was rather sleeping throughout the shoots and let her brother handle the unit. So the stupidity! Watch at your own risk if you are a fan of any of the actors. Otherwise, skipping wouldn't be much harmful other than the fact that all your friends would've possibly seen it, thrice, already.can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Looper," Brilliant Movie Told In A Snail-Paced Way!
","So, the actors have acted well. Joesph over-acted, no doubt. Emily Blunt is sexy as she was in TDWP. Bruce is hands down, awesome! But I like him in Die Hard more.The story could be more interesting sans the telekinetic child who will (per se) rule the world as an avenger. Shite! That messed this up. The time travel theory was good. The screenplay was better. The thrills were best and even Cid's performance was greatest, but his character couldn't survive this plot.I was bored at times whenever they hung out or talked about the barn area; just like its atmosphere, I took snack breaks at that time. The direction is good so is the music. But Hans or Thomas could've done it better. But I guess they are Johnson relatives. (Don't give me the fact crap)Bottom line, LOOPER is amazing yet hard-boiled; its cast is super but the characters are little feeble.

What We Do in the Shadows," For What You Expect, It Is Totally Unfunny. ♦ 0%
","I love the team behind this film for having made me laugh with their quirky ideas in TV shows and other films. Flight of the Conchords' two-season TV show was immensely enjoyable. But, in here, all I could see was first person conversations that are everything but funny.Narrating their life and death stories are four wannabe vampires who take pride in their ages and useless powers. While one would expect the film to advance to a laugh ride, it goes nowhere. They occupy a dull mansion and invite virgin friends of friends to victimize them; how convenient! Now I am all yes for not having a proper storyline, but there is no humor in even the farthest corners of the dialogs. I may have chuckled once or twice, but they were due to slapstick, which also starts to decline after the first twenty minutes.The makers fail to understand that a promising premise cannot single-handedly drive a good show; it's got to have traction. There is nothing much else to talk about this film that is basically a bad and cringe-worthy execution.BOTTOM LINE: If it is streaks of laughter that you are expecting to do while watching this indie satire show, then I'll suggest you better wait till the time they start selling the DVDs for free, if that ever happens.

Cloud Atlas," Cloud Atlas Fails To Impress. Period.
","All the starts that I give is for the music and the CGI or SFX. The plot is too rusty to understand. Yet some plot points are way too chafed and over-clichÃ©d. Cloud Atlas failed to impress me because even though it has my favorite non-linear type of narration, the plot slips into ambiguity. What is the writer trying to prove or convey here? The pivotal thing remains a secret, however.The cast is good, with some serious acting by Tom Hanks, but Halle Berry quite didn't fill up the cavity which I see as a flaw. The Michael Caine impersonator was funny, though!It is too long (around 3 hours) to sit and watch plus it doesn't throw any new, inventive or thrilling points for us to consider.

","I feel bad because it has ended. One of the coolest trilogies. Dandy characters. I'll miss the wolf-pack. 7.5/10.The setup continues and this time it's all based on Chow. I loved Stu's performance among the three in this installment. Alan's demeanor is lovable and it has lots of twists in store for you. The plot is kinda weaker than the prequels. It slightly gives an impression that it was made-up. The things that Part 3 misses is the originality, humor intensity and adventures. It lacks the latter a bit much. Also, the prevention of nudity, sex & drug abuse is quite a good approach to end the franchise. Nice.Music is, as always, good. Screenplay is good. The second half being more lively, I enjoyed the movie to the fullest because every time it shows a flashback, I experienced goosebumps. Lovely. I won't reprimand much for its goofs, illogical sequences & timid writing, because the idea itself is worth an applaud. Good job, Todd Phillips & crew!BOTTOM LINE: A watchable sequel, but not a laugh riot. If you've enjoyed the series, this is a must watch.

Green Book," One-Line Review: Green Book (10 Stars)
",Peter Farrelly's Green Book is the most pleasurable piece of cinema - which is both majestically crafted (Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen kill it) and socially relevant (it's about racism in the US of 1960s) - that I have seen (since the 2011 French drama The Intouchables) so far of everything that came out in 2018 that I have already decided to dedicate the whole of 2019 to singing its praises to every other person I meet who is interested in films.

Minions," Lose Emotions. ♦ 40%
","Adults generally relate with the Despicable Me franchise not because of the evil factor, but because of the emotional connect that is present in its oddball narratives. In Minions, however, there is a gaping lack of emotions.Three minions are on a quest to find a fitting, evil master for its tribe who, we are told, have been around since the dawn of the time. They were friends with dinosaurs and still there was no mention about them in Jurassic Park (1993). In the year 1968, the trio go to the Big Apple and then to the English capital, after having seemingly found their master, a female antagonist (Bullock). Then the plot is more or less about her evil plan.One will not feel touched with the things that happen in the film, most of which are straight mindless. While there are too many factors that betray the film of originality, even the minions fail to deliver. The sequels (2010 and 2013) are good, relatable films that are high on humor. But in here, the humor is all situational and these are boring situations that I am talking about. Also goes a bit annoying towards the end with that save the world crap. As is apparent from the sequels, minions are again only a small part of the film. The duel between good and evil is also badly handled as the climax ends the charade with a delightful surprise.BOTTOM LINE: Minions is a perfect example of a studio that has run out of ideas and is only making films to make some moolah out of 'gibberish.'VERDICT: 3 stars out of 10.

Inside Llewyn Davis," Llewyn Davis's Week In A Well-Carved Nutshell. ♦ 85%
","I haven't been that impressed by the director duo with their takes on crime, except No Country For Old Men; that was epic. But this time around they give out such an enterprising story, I sat there relating it to myself.As the story moves forward, we are given a perspective through the protagonist. Oscar Isaac has marvelously played the character and it is only because of him that we both feel sad & funny about his plight and his toil and his homelessness. His actions are so true to the level it never goes haywire because reality shines everywhere in the script: from the cat called Ulysses to his ex-girlfriend to his famous father. All elements are so finely tuned, I am in love with this film so much.Next is the music; I might cry if it doesn't win an Oscar for the sound mixing. Such wonderful folk songs... they are in my local play-list now. Beautiful lyrics, production by T-bone and Isaac himself with the diction. And the songs are played in full, which doubles the enhancement.The plot is maneuvered nicely etching a powerful screenplay, keeping us away from boredom. And humor at the right time when it is least expected was another fantastic thing about it. Inside Llewyn Davis is told in less than 2 hours and it captures the whole terrible week of the singer in a fabulous fashion; it talks about people, relationships, road to fame and most importantly, struggle. It throws light into how passion can sometimes fail to earn us a bread. But, this has more to it. Go ahead!BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended! This is the right film to catch with your sweetheart on a cold winter night. The songs will get you. 8.5/10.",9,0,2,2 March 2014

'Let Us Not Make Some Sense' should have been the title. I cannot take the much-loved horror genre no more.

Supporting cast is very strong and special mention to Tobey Maguire's seamless narration & Joel Edgerton's demeanor. The women are cute & dramatic in here.The beauty of the film lies in its editing, CGI, VFX & SFX. The soundtrack, although inappropriate, supports as a good rendition. Direction & screenplay keeps you hooked, as well. Cinematography is almost perfect with fantastic rendering with the camera. I am spellbound by the writing. As far as the story is concerned, the suspense created in the initial half crosses its peak and fools around throwing it to the audience sans punch. Now I haven't read the book, so I don't know who's to blame here. That is the only thing that fell short of me rating it a perfect 10. It is 9.2, instead and most of it is because of the cast, camera work & score.So the question about Oscar - no Leo won't grab it this time either.

The story revolves around an imminent revolution in a dystopian era and the vengeance with which the mysterious masked man sets out to take on the corrupted place.With thrilling action sequences and an immense music pleasure, VFV delivers an absolute cinema where one sits and wonders about what will happen next.

Furious 7," Check Your Brain At The Door & Enter! ♦ 57%
","It is a good thing the franchise sampled the heist element into its defining genre of car and culture, otherwise hardly would it have reached the level it has now. Growing through sequel after sequel, in this seventh installment of the beloved, sentimentally-charged series, the only problem is - it goes beyond adequacy.Finally stitching together the third film and its sequels, the plot takes you on a revenge game from the antagonist's side. The Toretto-O'Connor family has developed over the years, and the sentimentality is all over the place, giving the plot a considerable dose of melodrama. But the past is back to haunt them as Shaw (Statham) is vowing to avenge his brother's free-fall from that never-ending runway in the sixth film. Starting with an attack on Hobbs (The Rock), Shaw visits Dom and gang from time to time like he's an insurance agent coming in for monthly checks. All he does is arrive, talk, shoot few bullets and beautiful grenades, and leave.Then the plot drifts to a side story about a hacker who is being pursued by a dumb marauder. Unfortunately the primary bad guy (Statham), as one can possibly detect, has a screen space less than that of the Indian lad Ali Fazal. He is vindictive, agreed, but switching ON and OFF between the scenes is equivalent to a show without a villain. It mostly looked like that Dom and his gang are fighting and driving for nothing. That is confirmed when in the second half you see all of Hollywood crammed into one big setting, where all rules of science, logic, and common sense go take a hike. The second biggest problem with the plot is that Hobbs, who as an anti-hero changed the way the audience saw The Fast & The Furious series evolve, is left out. It was a delight watching him in the last two films, but in here, he is not even given his fair share of comedy. Tyrese may make you laugh with maintained humor, but he definitely overdoes it. However, fans expecting explosions WILL get explosions. After tanks and freighters, here we have flying cars and buses fit with machine guns. The action goes couple of notches higher, with breathtaking (is the right word) sequences helped by beautiful photography. The camera work is better due to the use of slow-motion stunts. If you take the advice I have mentioned in the summary, you will find delight in watching these scenes that unfold in the first half. Second half is tedious and draggy. With a climax that lasts an eternity adds further boredom to the viewing experience and makes Hollywood look like Bollywood. Even the music is a let down.The character of Letty (Rodriguez) was best left dead, because she is one player causing sameness in the film. With that silver Christ locket exchanging necks and hands more than a regular one dollar bill, it would have been wiser to prune the family business, now that Mrs. O'Connor is being cast only for the purpose of producing babies. Diesel is fine, Statham is badly cast, while Walker is purportedly the man of the show. A glorious tribute at the end closes the show with a tear.BOTTOM LINE: Watchable, because it very well defines what the franchise is all about - ones and zeros as in binary which relates to fear and loyalty as in family. So, limit your brain and experience the high-octane drama. 6/10.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",6,3,18,2 April 2015
