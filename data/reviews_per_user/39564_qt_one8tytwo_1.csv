Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Great acting, writing, and entertainment makes a great ending
","Going into this film, I expected another kung-fu action flick with Tarantino's creative flare thrown in the mix like the first one. However, I found that this movie was completely different from the first. Where the first lacked in much character development, it was made up for in Kill Bill: Vol. 2. The performances from every character were right where they needed to be, and, not uncommon for Tarantino movies, the dialog was witty when it needed to be witty, sadistic when it needed to be sadistic, and interesting the entire time. The audience can really feel the successes and pain of Uma Thurman through her terrific acting.Even if you haven't seen the first Kill Bill, I recommend watching this. I would not be surprised if it was nominated for an Academy Award for it stood alone as a powerful movie. 9/10.",9,4,8,21 August 2004
