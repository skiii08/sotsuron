Blade Runner 2049," Bladerunner 2049 : A No Spoilers Review
","The old dilemma of which version of Bladerunner to watch was big enough (Tip: Final Cut first), before those who haven't seen it now having to grapple with the new quandary of which order to watch the old and the new 2049 sequel. As equally ambiguous as the question of Deckard's nature as human or replicant, there is no sure-fire answer. However, if choosing to watch the original after viewing the new, one might be surprised by the human lightness in the tonal darkness of the original, with Harrison Ford's performance echoing a little of Star War's Han Solo's acerbic wit for instance. 2049 to this end lacks humour (arguably befitting of the new story), save for Ana de Armas' lightly jovial warm charm thawing some of the coolness of the latest offering. It's perhaps ironic that the new Bladerunner comes out of the eternal night of the original and shows us some of the daylight world of the evolved dystopia, yet at the same time is a darker serving of film noir. Leto's menacing performance unflinchingly twists a knife into this darkness that reminds us that Roy Batty's commination in the original was still served up with a sardonic smile and while neither story tells of a happy place, 2049 shows a world where the existence of soul is as sapped as the attenuation of nature in dystopia's collpased eco- systems and smoggy Anthropocene environment. The oppressiveness of Bladerunner 2049 overshadows some of the enjoyment of the original, as the original's music score was able to cut through and lighten the insalubrious world of 2019. To expect to be able to directly transpose Vangelis' majestically atmospheric sound track to the future incarnation is naive, in so much it is a near-impossibility. Instead, Hans Zimmer & Benjamin Wallfisch's score is giddily claustrophobic and gurning, in keeping with the oppressiveness of this new world, but they do still manage to successfully interweave sufficient traces of Vangelis' sound to evoke memories of the original at key moments. The synths of the original are missing - On the one hand, they would seem dated and retro to a modern audience, but on the other, fans of the original may be left searching for a 2049 equivalent of the aural (and visual) splendour of Zhora's crashing through the window in 2019. However, 2049 does gift us with a poignant parallel to 2019's 'Tears in the rain'. Villeneuve undoubtedly succeeds with the poison chalice brief of delivering a true and organic sequel, although its pace can set it jarringly apart from Ridley Scott's original. Wide panning landscape cinematography perhaps unifies the two though and Villneuve brings his aerial down-panned camera tracking , present in Sicario, to build upon and vary the mode. One could also wonder if Villneuve used his alien-encounter offering, Arrival, as a stalking horse to test audience's patience for deliberately paused pacing in the story telling. It's ironic that Ridley Scott has recently stepped on accelerate with the lightening fast-paced Alien Covenant, erroneously seeking to satisfy audiences with a tighter film, whereas Bladerunner 2049 is daringly ballsy in its non-compliance and gratuitous play to the fans' indulgence - A move that perhaps hurt its box office takings, by restricting run times and turning off those lacking patience to sit through 2 hrs 43 mins of storytelling. Furthermore however, after enduring the cheesy Marvel trailer for Thor: Ragnarok before the title screen of Bladerunner 2049, one is eternally thankful that 2049 is not a similar 'crash- bang-wallop' high-speed CGI affair. 2049 has grit and CGI, but both are wholly intelligently used without notable artificiality or feeling of sensationalism or bombardment. And whilst 2049 truthfully does require patience at times with its plodding pace, it still offers high-octane satisfaction, selectively served up to strictly necessary ends instead of titillation. One could argue that some of the acting performances take a moment to bed in. Take Arma's wooden voice in the background as we are introduced to her in K's apartment, but as with all new faces in this film, their delivery and demeanour soon find definition in their context. No more so than Gosling's performance, which shows indifference and superficiality, but also depth and dynamic range, all with narrative intention to the story that unfolds before the viewer.In conclusion, 2049 is stylistically different but a clear extension of the original set in 2019 with parallels in tone, machinery, familiar faces and symbolisms. It's a blessing that the theatre trailer does not disclose enough to spoil the adventure that this new film offers, which the viewer can share through K's personal voyage of confounding discovery. The plot meanders with obfuse yet intentional purpose to wrap up neatly with a nice twist and satisfactory closure, while also setting a new dynamic in motion for the story to evolve in some future new chapter, be it earth-bound or off-world.",9,0,2,20 October 2017
Bird Box," Better than average B-movie.
","At 2 hours run-time you could be put off watching this when taking poor reviews into consideration and particularly if you expect the blindfolded concept to be an imaginatory stretch too far. However, with practical answers quickly offered up in the film as to the mechanics of apocalyptic survival without sight you can begin to suspend disbelief and settle into the plot development. Strong acting, and for that matter an incredible cast line-up, help it flow from a sluggish start to a rapid finish, like the river running through the film. Some critics pick up on the weak character development, but it's wrong to get too bogged down in irrelevant back stories that could just needlessly dilute the storyline. Bullock is a tour de force (as always) and certainly adds credibility to what could easily be a lame duck horror-thriller if acted out by unknown actors. The demons (or whatever spectre name they may be assigned) are, and remain, a largely unexplained mystery, along with a box of other miscellaneous loose threads. Nevertheless, the trick is to just go with the flow and not over-analyse what is overall a better than average B-movie.",7,0,2,6 February 2019
Van Helsing," A Veritable Monster-Mash
","Judging this movie for what it is, a fantasy film, it delivers well with reasonable acting (Kate Beckinsale's accent is even credible), good effects and a story-line writhes around enough to remain sufficiently unpredictable and suspenseful. With its veritable monster-mash of Dracula, his heinous brides, Dwerger minions and deranged servant Igor, as well as Frankenstein's monster and werewolves, all boxes are ticked and the character variety helps the plot from running dry at any point. Obviously there are moments of incredulity (such as constant falls from great heights), but what else would you expect from a fantasy fable and since the film doesn't take itself too seriously neither should you and just enjoy the fun.",7,2,3,6 December 2018
The Great Gatsby," The Glossy Gatsby
","Viewing with no knowledge of the storyline nor expectations, the Great Gatsby was an interesting and enjoyable watch and delivers visual delights that gloss over its flaws, but flaws it does have.Firstly, if unfamiliar with the now 93 year old original novel, this vivid and slightly surreal adaptation presents a vision of 1920s New York that can lead you down a false path of wondering whether the tale is one big dream and if Gatsby is a figment of Nick's (our narrator and main protagonist) imagination or even whether Gatsby is perhaps some kind of conjurer magically manifesting his fantasy mansion and its entourage of characters into reality; notably as we first meet him flitting around his party sporting some kind of sorcerer's ring, which though the camera pans in on it on numerous times it receives no explanation other than latterly seeming to reflect with his obsession for the green light of the pier at Tom and Daisy's shoreline home. However, we should really take cue simply from Nick's first colourful experiences of New York City to understand that everything in the story is portrayed as larger than life and in the extreme. It is of course to be expected if (but only 'if') you know that Baz Lurhmann is at the directorial helm, with Moulin Rouge helping to explain the hallucinogenic hues of Gatsby's world, although this can be bewildering at times to the uninitiated viewer, especially when suddenly presented with Gatsby's yellow car darting around impossibly from West Egg to Manhattan like some cartoon car from Roger Rabbit (as others have suitably compared the scene).Layered on top of the cotton candy dream-world is a modern soundtrack with notable use of Jay Z, Beyonc√© and the XX. It's a bold move and challenge to established formats of period dramas being married to contemporaneous compositions. It's a fun rule to break, but the result is patchy in its application and the cynic within may wonder whether the score has been sold out to music execs pushing for that attractive soundtrack spin-off extra revenue. These things can be overlooked, as the ethereal feel of the film also somehow manages to mask a fairly substandard script (at worst when forced to listed to Gatsby's catchphrase of 'Old Sport' seemingly stuck on repeat, critical character underdevelopment (most notably with Elizabeth Debicki's intriguing but unexplored character of Jordan) and mediocre or hammy acting, of which nearly all the actors seem to be guilty of at some stage. When all is said done though, this is still a fun ride of a film and its imperfections are hidden with aesthetic distraction and its quick pace, despite clocking in at 143 minutes run time (although shorter if you deduct the soundtrack credit roll at the end).",7,1,1,8 November 2018
