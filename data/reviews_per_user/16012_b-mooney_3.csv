Casablanca," Brilliant film-making and wonderful acting
","I have a poster of Casablanca on my wall because my fianc√© has seen it and he made me put it up. I never thought that I would see the movie, but now that I have, I am glad. I thought that the lighting was outstanding. The use of the spotlights outside the windows gave it a suspenseful tone. The spotlight on Sam, the piano player, definitely made him stand out. The camera was very versatile, with close-ups and long shots combined in a very artistic and meaningful way. I noticed that the face of Bergman seemed almost perfect through the use of lighting as well. Rick was definitely the protagonist in the movie, but he was not a hero at all. He was mostly concerned about his own well-being throughout the entire movie. The antagonist in the movie was the Nazis. I enjoyed the fact that the movie touched on the fact that the Nazis were human beings as well. It showed the weaknesses that they have. I don't think I have ever seen a film in which the Nazis are portrayed in this way. I also noticed that there was a lot of sound in this movie. The piano was playing almost the entire time, there was singing, and there was humming. It really brought it all together and significantly contributed to the verisimilitude of the film.",8,0,3,22 October 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," An oddly fascinating film
","I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film because I generally don't opt to watch films that deal with the war subject. I just find it to be dark and depressing. Don't get me wrong, this movie is dark and depressing, but the use of comedy to lighten the mood was a very clever tactic. I couldn't stop laughing for most of the film. I noticed with respect to the sound that the 'marching on' song was played every time there was a scene with the plane that was to release the nuclear bomb. I thought that it was a good way of familiarizing the audience with the mood of the people in the plane. I found it highly ironic that all of these safety mechanisms were put into place in case the other country dropped a nuclear bomb, and yet they could not be deactivated under any circumstance. I guess the whole concept of a nuclear war is ironic in itself though. I thought that the acting was superb in the movie and I wouldn't have guessed that the same person played all three of those characters. What a feat. I couldn't get enough of Dr. Strangelove. I really liked the sequences of nuclear bomb explosions at the end of the film. I thought that was a nice piece of cinematography to add to the film. The film also made good use of parallel editing. The plane, the base, the pentagon...and everything was occurring simultaneously, supposedly. Outstanding cinema.",9,1,2,5 December 2009
The Graduate," timeless classic
","I was pleasantly surprised that this movie was so enjoyable because I don't think that Dustin Hoffman is remotely sexually attractive. He surprised me though with his excellent acting. The scene at the party where everyone was in his face and the camera was close up was a good method of conveying how smothered he felt. Additionally the scene where he is in his scuba get-up showed how different he felt from his parents and their friends. I found the movie sad, realistic, and fulfilling. The editing was continuous and the narration smooth. I found it difficult to analyze the movie formally while I was watching it because the story was especially unique and I definitely became way too absorbed. Awesome flick.",9,0,0,15 December 2009
