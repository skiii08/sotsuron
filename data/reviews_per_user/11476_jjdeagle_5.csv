The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project tells the story of how several documentarians attempt to find a legendary witch.
","The Blair Witch Project is the worst film I have ever seen. The success of the film is partly due to the ignorance of the spectators. Today's audience is so gullible that they actually believed that this is a documentary. This movie has made more money than any other movie in relation to its budget (Titantic has grossed the most). This piece of garbage is filled with weak acting performances all around. As a horror film, it is about as scary as the comedy, See No Evil Hear No Evil. The script is definitely not written by Robert Bolt (Lawrence of Arabia). The cinematography is so unsteady that the cameraman had to be Muhammad Ali or Pope John Paul II. The film is short but it is more torturous than watching the long version of Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900. Save your money on this one. It's hard to believe, but the sequel is better.",1,1,4,1 January 2005
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver
","Taxi Driver is the best film of the century. Martin Scorsese's use of point of view show the mind of the tortured Vietnam, veteran, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro). The film is loosely inspired by John Ford's The Searchers. Paul Schrader's excellent script is obviously based on some of Dostoevsky's novels. Harvey Keitel is outstanding as the pedophile pimp. Martin Scorsese was not nominated for an Academy Award, but it is his best work. The movie was almost given an X rating for extreme violence. Jodie Foster as the 12 year old prostitute received her first Oscar nomination (best supporting actress). The film lost out in the Best Picture category to John G. Avildsen's Rocky. The most memorable shot in the film is the scene where Bickle is talking to Betsy. The camera moves past him and focuses on an empty hallway. This symbolizes Bickle's loneliness.",10,1,2,31 December 2004
The Godfather: Part II," The Godfather Part 2 continues the Corleone saga.
","The Godfather Part begins with Michael as the King of the Corleone crime family. Michael is nearly assassinated by Hyman Roth played by Oscar nominee Lee Strasberg. Michael sets up a partnership with Roth in Cuba but they are ousted during Castro's overthrow of Batista. Michael finds out that his older brother Fredo had betrayed him. Meanwhile, young Vto Corleone is rising to power. Rober De Niro won his first Academy Award as the young Don. As Deniro rises, the story flips back to Michael's fall. Michael is investigated by a crime commission. G D Spradlin is excellent in the role as a a politician who is blackmailed into supporting Michael. Michael V Gazzo is excellent as Frankie 5 Angels.",10,0,1,12 November 2005
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A man is sent to a mental asylum in Oregon and challenges a nurse for the souls of the inmates.
","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the best films of the 1970s. It is based on Ken Kesey's novel of the same title. The title comes from the children's nursery rhyme that goes, 'One flew east. One flew west. One flew over the cuckoo's nest. It later became a hit stage play starring Oscar nominee Kirk Douglas. Kirk's son, Michael, later bought the film rights and felt that his father was too old to play the part of Randall Patrick McMurphy. James Caan turned down the lead role. Jack Nicholson also turned it down and then changed his mind. The film became a box office hit and won five Academy Awards. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Bo Goldman, Milos Forman, and Michael Douglas were awarded Oscars for their excellent work. Brad Dourif was nominated for best supporting actor, but lost to George Burns.",10,3,6,1 January 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The final installment in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy
","This film won 11 Oscars including best Picture. The Return of The King is an awful film. At well over three hours, it is an exercise in boredom. Orlando Bloom and Viggo Moretensen are completely miscast. The story does not make sense and the characters are contrived. It is like playing a bad video game. So many actors are wasted in this colassal disaster. Peter Jackson, winner of the Best Director Academy Award, seems as though he thought that his film was too precious to edit. The film goes on and on and on. Weak acting all around. The film relies on special effects to cover for a script that is completely pretentious. The musical score is like listening to someone scratching a chalkboard.",1,4,24,12 November 2005
