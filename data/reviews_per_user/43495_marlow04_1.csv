E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A true classic for the entire family!
","E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)A story of an extraterrestrial left behind on Earth who encounters a human boy, Elliott (Henry Thomas). He and siblings Gertie and Michael (Drew Barrymore and Robert MacNaughton) attempt to care for and return the alien home while hiding it from their mother Mary (Dee Wallace) and the rest of the town. The extraterrestrial (dubbed E.T.) was spotted and is now being searched for by the authorities, all while the children plan his escape. This movie is widely accepted as a classic, and even though it is an alien movie produced in 1982 without modern CGI, the E.T. character is still believable today.Steven Spielberg has once again brought to life a child-hood fantasy of an alien life-form on Earth. Elliott, the coy young boy who makes first encounter with the extraterrestrial is filled with curiosity and fear after seeing something rustling in the backyard. One theme woven throughout the film is Elliott's close connection to E.T. as Elliott clearly struggles with feelings of alienation by his brother, neighborhood bullies, and the loss of his father in divorce. This film certainly incorporates internal truths of human nature, in that Elliot and E.T.'s friendship is real and good; contrary to how these events would likely play out in reality. Elliott was determined to prove to his family that he wasn't just a kid make believing, so he camped out in the backyard waiting for E.T. to show up again. After coaxing him into his home by leaving a trail of Reece's Pieces, he began building a friendship with him. His bullying older brother Michael was so surprised when he saw the alien for the first time in Elliott's bedroom; he immediately joined Elliott and younger sister Gertie in the mission to help him find a way home. This film takes full advantage of children and adult's imaginations, as nearly anyone can inject themselves into the role of one of these characters. Elliott began feeling a physiological connection to E.T. when he noticed feeling drunk after E.T. was home drinking beer out of their fridge. E.T. slowly began feeling weaker and weaker here on Earth as Elliott's health also began deteriorating. Eventual capture by authorities, E.T.'s 'glowing heart' brought him (and Elliott) back to life as they approached near death. Elliott's clear mission of getting E.T. back home kept him going and gave him purpose. The experience of this young boy and his extraordinary friend as his main confidant against all odds, reminds me of another childhood favorite, Cloak & Dagger. Also starring Henry Thomas as Davey Osborne and filmed in 1984. Davey and his imaginary friend were on the run evading bad guys to save the day. This was another situation where a young boy, against all odds, leveraged his friends and his own resourcefulness to save himself and save the day.This film was often shot with a low camera angle to depict the viewpoint of Elliot, E.T., and the other children in the story. From the beginning of the film where the authorities are first after E.T. in the woods, the audience was pulled into this 4 foot tall world. Much of the films lighting mirrored the theme of connection between Elliot and E.T., and the health of these characters. The beginning of the movie was dark and foggy, which gave the audience a bit of apprehension toward this alien visit. But as Elliot and E.T. become friends, the lighting brightens and the apprehension is gone. When they become sick, the director places them in the cold, dark, and damp woods; the lighting continues to be subdued until they are both 'healed' toward the end of the film. The final run toward the landing site to enable E.T.'s escape is exciting, bright, and sunny. The use of lighting and climate helped pull the audience into the overall feeling of the characters at various points in time throughout the film. Together, Elliot and E.T. won over his brother Michael, the neighborhood bullies and Elliott's mother, who finally stopped doubting Elliott. This same group supported and assisted in the escape of Elliot and E.T. from the authorities to eventually help E.T. transport home. Through the relationship built with E.T., Elliott came out of his shell and transformed from that coy young boy to a brazen young man.Enjoy!",Null,1,1,16 September 2011
