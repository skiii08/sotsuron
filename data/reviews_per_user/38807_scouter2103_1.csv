Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Best yet ....... i'm not being bi est
","Well well. I have been disappointed with a few films in my time and this film was not one of them. Depp acts as Jack, or rather captain jack to his usual standard. There is the same lighthearted humour that we have come to expect from the franchise. These comedy moments are actually funny. In fact I think it was funnier than even recent romantic 'comedies' such as 'Chalet Girl'. The Barbosa character is back, same with a new female lead who adds a Spanish flair, which suits Pirates very much so. The script in my opinion is good and there is a satisfying ending. Obviously they will be making more sequels. I do not mind the fact at all that Will or Elizabeth aren't in it; their story lines were finished more or less, and the film needed a new other lead to keep it fresh. if they had kept the same 2 actors then it still would have been the same old thing. I would recommend seeing this in 3D. All in all this film is worth seeing, especially if you're a pirates fan!",8,0,1,17 June 2011
