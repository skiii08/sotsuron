Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Better than the first
","While I feel that the 90 odd minutes of my life spent watching the first were not a complete waste (about 45 were spent dozing off) I felt cheated out of the rental price. I am not a great fan of Tarantino films. They are typically overdone caricatures of a theme and very shallow.This was either a relief to see, or Quinten's head was a little clearer when he did this one. The supporting cast definitely adds to the story, and there are comedic moments of irony sorely lacking in the first.Beyond this however, the violence and profanity is still grossly mindless- I am not at all opposed to either, however it must be justified with context.",5,0,2,29 June 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Not a positive review
","Prefacing this with the comment that I am not particularly a Tarentino fan and do not find brilliance or genius in his movies should help you decide if the review will be of any value. I have appreciated (as opposed to enjoyed) a few of his films. This is not one of them.For the budget and era, this film is very disappointing. Once again Tarentino focuses on the shock value of over the top violence and profanity to rewrite what is essentially the Charlie's Angles plot.Eyecandy toys and action in a film can be nice but do not compensate for the essentially shallow and clich√©d plot which left me dosing off about half way through.In comparison to other films by this director this one lacks any additional elements such as irony, surrealism, or comedy. Definitely not a repeat viewer.",3,11,18,29 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Disappointing conclusion
","This episode of the series was the most disappointing, not because of any lack of eye candy, which was good, but for the focus and the changes made to the conclusion. I was really into the first film, the second filled in the important place between what should have been a great beginning and action packed end... This one fell short of the grandiosity I perceived in the books. Peter Jackson is brilliant in bringing the books to life as well as he did, but this was honestly over hyped. It was probably the ending that put the nail in the coffin. Being a fan of the books I expected something a little better, but it was perhaps my girlfriend of the time who put the right perspective on it likening the end-scene to a homosexual punchline.",6,2,5,30 June 2005
