The Finest Hours," Watch it with Patience, That's the key and you will love it.
","Well, its a good film with a very intelligent chosen cast and crew with some good periodic effects and a good essence of history which was lost in bundle of heavy history books. I must say watch it with patience in your heart and trust me Disney films always fulfills one promise and that is entertainment. Chris Pine is a fine actor along with other actors he re creates the magic of history. Cinematography, specially the long shots are really amazing. The body language of all the characters is so good that you feel like they are from the fifties. It's a simple film and you all movie watchers already know the story but i can assure you with one thing that it's good and it is handled with proper care. Finally, witness it with something good to eat and have good two hours.",7,2,4,14 May 2016
Room," Some things can only be felt by heart and cant explained by words but i will take a shot at it.
","When i started watching this film, for the first ten minutes i was not sure whether i can watch this film because of so many obvious things like the level of cruelty and where this film might lead towards but as this film entered into its fifteenth minute it gripped my brain completely and i understood what Brie and Jacob are doing here is not a performance but it's simply magic. They both have captured maximum space of the screen and they both have captured heart of millions. The directional eye is simply breath taking and the script - so simple yet very powerful. A well deserved Oscar to Brie Larson. I believe cinema like this makes this stage very important and appreciable. As a movie maker i must say this film is a milestone in cinematic achievements of all kind and i can simply congratulate each and everyone who were part of the cast & crew of the team and those who have already watched it. For those who are planning to watch it - watch it now because its a perfect ten pointer for the genre of Drama.",10,0,2,24 May 2016
