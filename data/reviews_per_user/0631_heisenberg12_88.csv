Blade Runner 2049," Well-Made, Thought Provoking, Imaginative, and Decent, But Something's Missing
","I just watched this for the first time knowing nothing about it except who was in it and recalling the original I've only seen once.It's a well-made movie, but something was missing. In a movie like this, I want a strong lead actor, and Gosling came across too paper-thin and mediocre for me at key parts, almost like the material was a little too outside his intelligence or emotional depth. At times, he was good enough, but at others, not so much.On the other hand, Ford is the best actor in the film, and he really delivers and brings some depth and grittiness to the role, enhancing the film's quality from the moment he appears on through til the end.Overall, it gave me what I wanted, which was a movie that would take me into another world and be a challenge, immersive, and different, but most sci-fi films do that anyway. That being said, as far as Sci-Fi movies go, it was above average.I have to give a shout out mention to the dog, just because up until that scene late in the movie, there wasn't really too much to like about the movie outside of the visuals and some cool-looking effects.I just think it needed a better lead actor, which makes me long for the 70s and 80s, even the 90s, when most leading men for a film like this would be man's men, more manly, more charismatic, and be able to chisel the script down to become a star and own the film. Acting is a huge chunk of a movie. You can have great scenery, visuals (cinematography), music, and even a good supporting performance in a generally good concept, but the greatest movies of all-time usually have a stand-out leading performance from an actor or actress to go with it and make it stand out even more.Gosling doesn't totally fail, but he doesn't shine either, and that's a big problem in a movie that needed a stronger lead actor to make it more engaging, especially since the movie is close to three hours long. I might watch it again for the visuals and to try to decipher some information regarding the whole futuristic universe of replicants that I missed or couldn't follow very clearly to see if I would have enjoyed it more if I knew what was happening better at a certain scene, but I doubt it will make me like it more since the story wasn't anything particularly great, special, or moving.6.5/10",6,1,3,31 January 2019
Scarface," 'Say Goodnight to the Bad Guy'- Pacino's greatest performance leads a star-studded cast to an 80's Masterpiece and crime classic
","Pacino stars in his best acting performance, and what might be the best acting performance of all-time. He makes this film what it is by completely owning his character and the movie in every scene he is in. He is constantly poised and focused, the way he would need to be navigating the Miami drug scene with his ambition.Unlike other classics like Goodfellas and Heat, which rely on a strong ensemble of performances, Scarface is Al Pacino's movie. It's not to say that the supporting cast is not good; they certainly are, but Pacino dominates the screena nd carries the movie with his over-the-top, classic performance.'What's coming to you Tony?' 'The world chico, and everything in it', Pacino replies to his Cuban immigrant friend. This is a story of ambition, betrayal, ego, and greed. Montana's core is believable and relatable to anyone with ambition. It is understated how epic his climb from Cuban refugee to leader in the drug business is. The 2 hours and 50 minute run time sounds long, but you don't really notice it since the movie maneuvers through each of its Acts in a stylish, entertaining, and action-packed way.
Scarface may be off-putting and too cheesy for some first time viewers who are expecting to be hooked by action or more impressive cinematography. They may not relate to the rawness, darkness, and edginess of Tony's story, or the 80s vibe it has to it may not interest them at first. But if you put in the effort to accept this movie for what it is, which is an 80's gritty crime tale featuring what is arguably the best and most memorable performance of Pacino's career and you dive deeper into the themes of ambition, success, greed, ego, friendship, loyalty, and betrayal, you will understand what it's all about.Scarface isn't a shoot-em-up action thriller. It's a realistic story of one man's rise from rags to riches, from poverty to excessive wealth, from no power to all the power in the world, and the truths that exist once one arrives to the top in all its corruption, excess, and notoriety.This movie has high rewatch value due to memorable lines all over it that are easily quotable thanks to Pacino's dialogues and monologues. In the pinnacle of crime and gangster movies, Scarface is a must own and must see.

Walk the Line," Great movie
","A story about redemption with great all around acting, writing, and directing. The music is pretty good, too, making it more enjoyable. Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar for best actress, well deserved, for her portrayal of June Carter. Joaquin Phoenix was nominated, but lost, even though he was definitely deserving for his outstanding performance of Johnny Cash. This is just a solid movie and even a bit underrated. It's easily one of the best films of the second half of the 2000s decade. It's also a great love story and story about friendship and family. It brilliantly brings legend Johnny Cash's humanity, human side to life- what inspired him, his upbringing, struggles, and family life.I wish they still made movies like this in recent years.9/10",9,1,1,16 February 2017
It," Creepy As Hell, and Disturbing
","I didn't expect much when finally getting around to watching 'It', but it didn't take very long to realize how eerily creepy and disturbing this movie is, despite so many lackluster reviews on here. Maybe my tolerance level for horror isn't as seasoned as lifelong horror movie fans, but since I've only seen about two new horror movies in the past fifteen years, this one really gave me the creeps. I'm still not a fan of horror movies, but this was a good enough one in my book. Comparing it to the 1990s made-for-tv version, I'd say it definitely equals it and probably raises it up a notch, which was more than I anticipated. Decent film.7.7/10",8,0,1,26 January 2019
Minority Report," A Long-Winded Failure
","It's been 17 years since I saw Minority Report in theatres. So immersed with it I was that I never felt a need or an urge to watch it again. Yet on a bored winter night I happened to catch it on cable and decided to revisit it since nothing else good was on.Well, not much has changed. Everything I felt for it and experienced the first time around was reconfirmed, except it was even worse the second time. This movie just meanders and meanders around without ever delivering anything memorable other than some interesting futuristic tech shots, which even still, today, really surprisingly seem outdated and long surpassed. Could this be the first movie of its kind that decided not to edit itself down by at least 1 hour, which has been a long-running trend with pretentious Hollywood flicks as of late- the last two decades.The movie is a failure because it had everything you would need to be great: Spielberg directing, Tom Cruise in the lead role, a very interesting premise and conflict, decent supporting acting and a relatively ambitious scope to it in a time when originality was still abundant in filmmaking (2002), but it just didn't live up to its potential. It's simply way too long, and even though it starts off pretty good, it definitely loses its steam and pinpoint focus in its runtime. The concept is great, but it just didn't deliver it well enough.5/10",5,4,7,17 December 2019
Training Day," Excellent, Realistic and Disturbing Look at Corruption in a Powerhouse Performance by Washington
","Revisiting Training Day the other day after about fifteen years actually raised my score of it from an 8 to a 9. At the time, back in 2001, when it was released it was following behind a golden streak of movie years dating back to the mid-90s, so maybe it wasn't as appreciated as it should have been since the standards were so high; it was still very good, but something left a little to be desired. This sentiment held true on the rewatch, but only as to the very end of the movie, which in my opinion was still disappointing.Having Alonzo go out like Scarface was a let down and still is. It feels like an easy way out and a lazy way to end the story; it may have been chosen to add to the realism of the movie, but the film was dark enough throughout and didn't need a pitch black depressing ending. They should have at least had Alonzo fire back in a shootout to take out some of the bad guys after him, but the writers didn't allow him to even get one shot off- kind of anticlimactic if you ask me.However, this is really my only complaint with Training Day. In a surprisingly completely original story, Denzel Washington takes Ethan Hawke's rookie NARC agent through the streets of L.A., teaching him that what he learned in the Academy means zilch in reality once he is in the street game.Washington's Alonzo rarely evokes sympathy and even when you think he may, you have to question if ALonzo is just playing the game since he is so deceitful and can fake his emotions so well. However, there is one scene where it looks like Alonzo does let his guard down, and it is in that brief moment that you see that the real Alonzo is a broken man who has been hardened and corrupted by the true realities of the job through the years, which has taken its toll on him, giving him no choice but to play the game.But make no mistake, Alonzo is a bad guy. When the plot unfolds and his reasoning and tactics are revealed, you see that he is a scheming criminal, who is ruthless and will do anything to save himself, even if it means gaming and playing a rookie partner as a pawn in his game of survival.There is lots of truth and revelations as to the nature of cop corruption in this movie that I had never seen this realistic before. The way Alonzo can get dirt on everyone, but only use it if he needs to is very shocking and eye opening. He uses it to keep everyone on the street (and in his department sect) in line, but if they step out of line and get him in trouble, then he will just go write them up for a past violation and charge them. Knowing this, he purposefully tempts those around him to commit crimes (sometimes deceptively) so that he immediately has dirt on them (exampled in telling Hawke to take the dirty money and smoke the marijuana, which Hawke later learns from Alonzo himself is actually a much harder drug in dust- this btw was one of the most disturbing scenes watching Hawke's character get corrupted so early on by this lie).Alonzo has his 'dogs' or 'boys' all over the slums of L.A., which are for the most part his informants who he has been protecting from throughout his time working the streets. But you watch as he will play them as an Ace card in the hole if he needs to in order to escape justice himself, and simultaneously he explains why these high rollers can never face the court since they have too much dirt on everyone else as well and it would be hard to get a conviction after years of them serving as informants.In summary, the movie depicts an inevitable corruption that evolves in some police departments, as Alonzo has become corrupted and disillusioned by the realities of the game, which can only be learned through experience. The dangers and temptations, as well as him facing himself in the mirror have taken their toll on his soul, leaving him with no choice but to check his heart at the door in order to survive both the street itself and his own criminality. Alonzo is ruthless and willingly wears two faces throughout the job, always playing chess, but for all of his street smarts, you can't help but despise his bad behaviors and corrupt acts.This is a great movie that is riveting, creates constant tension, and teaches what can go wrong in police departments, especially those that have to deal with the dregs of society and the drug game. Hopefully Hawke's character went on to just write parking tickets like he implied after getting a taste of the realities of the job that no good soul would ever want to be a part of.9/10",9,3,4,5 March 2020
Detroit," A good movie that should draw Oscar attention.. but not a great one.
","I sat through a long 2 hours and 15 minutes to watch Detroit because I'm a Kathryn Bigelow fan and was in the mood for a hard core drama. Neither of them disappointed. Detroit is excellently directed by Bigelow once again, and the drama doesn't get any grittier than this. After a somewhat slow introductory 30 minutes, once the main story gets in gear, it is riveting.However, for me, the film fell short as a whole. It is a movie that without doubt will attract award and Oscars buzz, and perhaps as a work of art, deservedly so. But I must say that I don't think this is the time to release a film like this. It felt like it was ill timed with the material, and I don't think that it's a time to relive these events. I say this because clearly it's a story Bigelow wanted to tell and delve into the topic. I just don't think this is the time to do it. In fact, the story is basically a semi- step by step retelling of the more recent LA riots- particularly the Rodney King story that started it. Personally, I also did not like Will Poulter's performance. I can tell when actors are imitating other actors rather than just doing their own take,, and it seemed like he was doing his Matt Damon+ Mark Wahlberg impersonation to play the head cop (or is he somehow related to them?). I just couldn't help but think the role was written for one of those two, who have played bad cops before, but they probably didn't want racist language attached to their star so Poulter got the part. He's good, but I felt like that role could have been played even more convincing by a different actor. Look, this is a good movie, and at times it is truly incredibly powerful. I almost called it a flawed masterpiece because a good portion and majority of the film is masterful and masterfully directed, but as a whole, it just didn't totally hold or add up. It's just not a movie I'd want to watch again, but for a one time viewing, I'd recommend a look. Bigelow is a master director and because of that, you can't go wrong checking out Detroit.7/10",7,2,7,18 August 2017
Chinatown," Not for me, but if you're into 70s and noir, you'll really like it
","Chinatown is supposedly one of the best films of all time and of the 70s. Maybe it is, but it's not for me. You really need to have a taste for 70s filmmaking and noir to appreciate this in its' fullest. I grew up in the 80s and 90s and always had a tough time praising movies of the 70s.The movie has plenty of good qualities such as the style, acting, intricate story lines, surprises, dialogue, and mystery. It's a good film, but I couldn't see all the universal praise it gets unless it's from people who grew up in the 60s or 70s.I fell asleep on consecutive nights while trying to get through it and finally finished it on the third try. While it is interesting and very intriguing, it didn't necessarily 'grip' me the way that a mystery/crime drama/thriller would be expected to. The most gripped I was during the whole movie came on my third try to finish it when Nicholson basically domestically abuses Mrs. Mulwray and she reveals something very disturbing. Shocks like this are always riveting, but I was more disturbed than impressed with the reveal. Maybe this was gratifyingly controversial and provocative for 1974? It didn't really work for me.While the film has classic qualities, without a doubt, by the end, for all the light it had shown at times for me, it sort of dimmed down a few points and I'll settle for a solid 7/10. It's a classic crime drama story and film that I highly recommend for that genre's list of originals, but outside of the hype, which by now appears to be bandwagon, I don't see how it's considered one of the best movies of all time. Good, but not great. 7/10",7,3,5,31 May 2016
A Star Is Born," Overrated but decent
","This is a little overrated. Just because a movie jerks a few tears doesn't mean it's anything great. Many average films have evoked sadness, but that doesn't mean they are special. While the end was much better than what came before it, it didn't elevate it enough to raise the overall rating. I had mixed feelings about the movie:The Good- Pretty good pace (if you're not into love stories or musical type movies, it's not that hard to sit through due to the decent edits and cuts) although at times I uncharacteristically could have used longer scenes at times, by the end of the movie you have to give credit to Cooper as the director (I didn't realize he directed it as I was watching), Lady Gaga's voice is an asset to the movie, and it does evoke emotion at times.The Bad- It misses on some notes, especially early on how the formation of the relationship feels rushed and almost not believable in a way, despite some aspects of charm which were decent (the scene where Gaga hits the guy at the bar wasn't buyable and isn't that assault), unfortunately even though I appreciate actors taking risks, it's a little bit masturbatory throughout the first quarter of it with regards to Hollywood stars celebrating themselves, I thought Cooper overacted just a little bit in this with his voice that reminded me of what Tom Hardy does and despite it I never saw anybody but Cooper in the role (in other words, the staple of a great acting performance is you don't even recognize the actor anymore but even with the voice focus, it didn't make me see Cooper any less than ever), it is comparable to a long music video at many times (but it's a movie), and it was somewhat superficial at times when it could have used more depth to increase the quality (for example, the way her career was able to develop and take off was done well enough to make you invested in it, but at the same time it happened so fast and what seemed like somewhat easily, which is hard to believe with the difficulty of that industry, so by the time the final quarter of the movie arrived, I didn't feel as much as I should have felt for Ally's journey).On an end note, the film does have charm and Cooper's character's story was poignant and lead to a place that had some power. While the movie is overrated, it's not bad at all and is slightly above average. I would recommend a watch, but don't expect anything super sensational or an elite classic or anything that you would want to watch again or over and over. 'Walk the Line' is a similar movie that is probably a little bit better than this one is overall.

Gravity," Liked It
","I missed Gravity when it came out, and finally caught up on it after having it on my bucket list of movies to see. Wow, did I miss out on a great one.Once again, my praise of the movie has as much to do with the amount of awful and cliché kinds of movies that continually are made and come out these days that either bore me or are an insult. Most are underwhelming and what I would refer to as 'opportunities missed'. Gravity doesn't miss. It is all it can be and I would highly recommend it.The beauty and visuals of the movie are incredible and awe inspiring, but I was also surprised that the story, acting, action, and dialogue were also very good. After seeing many survival movies where only one or two people battle nature or the elements, I had a good measuring stick for what to expect.There's Castaway and The Revenant for instance and although both these movies are good, the boredom that sets in at times due to having little instances for dialogue with others you do feel. In Gravity, the key to its' 'never boring' take on such a solo survival story is that it's short. The movie is only 1 hour and 31 minutes long so there is never a feeling that it drags at all, unlike similar movies like the aforementioned.Gravity is intense, gripping, fun to watch, emotional, and at times sprinkles in some unexpected humor to boot. Sandra Bullock is an inspiration. This is a must see, classic, science fiction movie with some of the best cinematography of a space movie ever. I was really glad I watched it and finally caught up on what I missed. 10/10",10,5,6,20 March 2016
Citizen Kane," NOT the greatest movie of all-time, and not even close
","So as many know, in recent years, Citizen Kane has made the top of the lists of prestigious 'Best Films of All-Time'. To be fair, that's an extremely bold claim, and those who make it have to understand they've already set expectations too high. I was aware of that, however, going in to my first time viewing as I've been there before with bold claims and know how to adjust to a more realistic preliminary mindset. Still, I did have some hopes it would live up to some level of greatness.It didn't. It was a mess. This was just a boring mess of a movie, and I was beyond disappointed. I was so bored and disengaged, I turned it off about an hour in. Not only was it boring, it was not even well done. The biggest problem is the ridiculously horrible editing. This movie is jumping all over the place with titles, voice overs, flashbacks, and current time scenes. That's effective if it's clean and not sloppy and if the film is entertaining, but this was none of those things. Now, I admit, I'm not a black and white, old movie fan. I've tried to like them through the years, but the quality compared to the last 3-4 decades is so much less, it's hard to relish in what it must have been like when these films were first released. However, I usually recognize something in them that I could understand why it might have been so popular or successful during its time. For example, It's a Wonderful Life and Casablanca had recognizable redeeming qualities. I rarely can ever raise an old classic film above an 8 rating out of 10, even when I find it good, usually due to the poor effects and camera work, in addition to other technicalities compared to more modernized, polished movies today and recent decades. But I can still find a reason why they were popular and found prestige. With Citizen Kane, I couldn't. People can like this movie if they want and critics can list it as one of the top 10 movies of all- time, even put it at number one, but I couldn't stand it. I truly found it boring, poorly made, poor quality, and a waste of my time and emotions.3/10. Awful.",3,5,10,6 February 2017
Memento," Great Filmmaking. One of the best of the 2000s.
","You have to watch this at least twice to really comprehend it. That's a good thing.This is one of the most original films I have ever seen. Nothing has ever been made like it. You will never forget it. Looking back at your life of watching films, this one really stands out as unlike any other.The originality is a spectacle. If you're looking for a film that is original, will challenge you to think, and can talk about with your friends, this will not disappoint.This movie was groundbreaking in many ways. While the late 90s and early 2000s had their fair share of great classics, most of them were similar to each other. This came out of nowhere with a whole different pace and was unlike the tone of any of the other ones, but it was great in its' own respect.",9,1,3,20 June 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Overrated- the stupid ending ruined it
","I want to give this movie a 10, but I just cant. At times it was groundbreaking, amazing, and awesome, and at other times it was frustrating, angering, and stupid.There are two scenes that I would put up as some of the best I've seen in any film in recent memory. They are masterful and unbelievably good. The only way I could break this one down is the good and the bad approach.Good: Opening 20 minute scene was spectacular, the female lead Laurent was great, Christopher Waltz gives one of the best performances I've seen of the 2000s and really almost single handedly makes this movie a 10/10, the plot- I really liked the story how it all revolved around film and movies and how the plan involved the help of a famous movie star, as well as how Laurent's character was undercover and at the center of the plan, the supporting actors- the crazy guy who loves to kill Germans who the IB's recruit is a great character along with the Englishman who goes with him to pick up the movie star and all of the other major characters who had lines (except Pitt- I'll get to that in a second), the cinematography, the dialogue, the humor- wow, this was one funny movie, no doubt, and it was riveting and held your attention from start to finish despite being a dialogue driven movie. There were times it was very reminiscent of Pulp Fiction, and I absolutely loved the similarities, but it was ultimately its' own movie.However, for as many good things about this movie (which is why I am so tempted to want to give it a 10, there were several letdowns.Bad: First, I was so pi--ed that Shosanna(Laurent) died. It was the most disappointing and pointless death in a movie I ever seen, and it loses 1 star right there. I really liked this character and she had a solid plan going that she was executing. There was absolutely no point in her dying. I actually LOVED this character so I was very mad at the filmmakers when she got killed pointlessly. She was really the main protagonist of the film, and all they had to do was allow her to escape and live happily ever after on a farm. That was BAD scriptwriting. That's just my opinion, but seriously- there was no reason for her to die- what a letdown. Second, relating to that, the whole ending sequence was a letdown and disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I loved the whole dynamite being placed and left in there, and I absolutely found it hilarious that Waltz (Landa) changed his mind and negotiated that deal- that was great, but for it just to be some big shoot-up-the place-massacre with Shosanna dead, I thought it could have been more of a caper or a twist could have been implemented to it. For example, what should have happened was the black guy, Shosanna, and the IB's left all should have escaped as the theater burned to the ground, instead of it blowing up and presumably having them die. I would have liked to have seen the black guy and Shosanna escaping like an ultimate crime caper, maybe even have them kiss in the parking lot and then show them on the farm together drinking milk or something- anything happy. Also, I would have liked to have seen Hitler escape because it just didn't make sense like that- yes it's fiction and I can handle much of that, but come on, at least have SOME historical accuracy breathe here at the end. They could have had Hitler escape from the second floor somehow and crawl away wounded but still alive so at least the war went on the way it really did and there would be a connection. Lol that would have been funny and still kept with the humor. Im not saying this ruined it or anything, but it was just a little bit too far fetched and that prevented me also from giving it a 10/10. Also, Brad Pitt- what was he thinking? I mean, don't get me wrong, he WAS funny and I found his character pretty funny in most of the scenes, but man, his acting in this was terrible. It was surprising that his acting was the weak link of the whole cast. I never would have thought that. Im not saying he sucks as an actor, and I know the humor was part of the role, but compared to the rest of the cast and actors/actresses who were superb and excellent, he was definitely the worst actor of the bunch, at least in this particular role. I know he's not that bad and has some talent to act, that's why I was surprised. Don't get me wrong- he wasn't the worst ever or anything like that, but he just acted pretty poorly in this, but it's funny too because I think he was just trying to be funny.Other than that, this was a great movie (could've been even greater if they would have made the ending better and done some of the things I mentioned above). Christopher Waltz was absolutely amazing and I can totally see why he won the Oscar for this. If nothing more, I would say this is one funny movie (one of the strangest funny scenes was watching Hitler laugh at the movie while people are being shot- that kind of humor is so weird yet also surprisingly hilarious at the same time. I thought the actor who played Hitler was hilarious in every scene he was in).",7,0,3,5 July 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Probably works best for fans, but a well made film in any case
","I'm not a big Star Wars fan, especially after RotJ in the 80s, as I haven't seen any of the movies since. However, I remember the big preview for Rogue One peaked my interest so I decided to finally give a new one a chance. At this point, I don't really see how movies like this can be 'original ' since I've seen so many of the same stories done before between 'father-daughter or father- son' beginnings and as the basis for films. Sure, some things were different in minor ways, but generally that's very familiar at the beginning, so I was like, 'I've seen this all before a thousand times'.However, it is a well made movie. Even as someone who hasn't followed the franchise in 25 or more years, I really liked the visuals, score, and the action scenes were good. It was a bit 'uneven' throughout in quality, but it did reach enough good moments. The end was great.Still, without being an avid fan and follower, I don't see how I can call this a great film. If I was a fan, maybe I could, but I can say that it is a good film and it was fun to break the ice and catch up after all these years having missed the new ones. I'll be watching in the Force Awakens, which has higher ratings on most review sites, next. 8/10",8,1,2,14 July 2017
Knives Out," More than just a murder mystery- it's a very funny and riot of a movie
","This movie had me laughing out loud at numerous spots, and sometimes it was the little things you just catch. To call this a 'murder mystery' would be deceiving imo because it was more like a comedy or a spoof. I haven't laughed so loud watching a movie in a while like I did with this. From the cracked cell phone to the political arguments, to the car chase (lmao) to the knife attack at the end (which I did see coming since I was accustomed to the vibe and humor by that point), I loved the humor.I also drew many abstractions from Breaking Bad, which Johnson played a pretty big role in directing some of the most famous episodes. That was a nice treat to see the homages.All the actors were great, but especially Craig, who really impressed me here since I'm not the biggest fan of his. But in this, I felt like he really embraced the comedy, humor, and eccentric role perfectly, showing range. The other actors and actresses all played their smaller parts well too, especially the one family member with the cane.8/10",8,6,13,9 January 2020
The Irishman," Unbiased Review for Those Interested in Maybe Seeing It: It's Worth a Watch
","Any movie that gets hype and Oscar buzz on here is going to draw lots of biased people reviewing it. Before I watched The Irishman, it was hard to gage which reviews were legit and real and which were just biased, whether it was in a positive way or a negative way. First off, De Niro has made lots of controversial political speeches in recent years, which can affect how people view this, and then there's the sort of de-aging CGI that some people took issue with (Is that really enough to warrant a 1-2 star rating though? Is it that bad?); on the positive side, Scorcese lovers may give it an automatic 10 since he is one of their favorites, which goes on a lot in reviews (let's face it; Tarantino often gets a free pass and 10 ratings even in his erroneous films).So with all that out of the way, here would be my honest review for people who may be interested but on the fence about seeing The Irishman.The first 1 hour and a half is absolutely dazzlingly amazing. I want to go as far as to say that I actually liked it more than Goodfellas, but I would have to see them both again to confirm that. It is an absolute masterpiece for the first hour and a half, no doubt.And Joe Pesci- just hand him the Oscar right now. He gives what is in my opinion the absolute best performance in the movie. I liked him better in this role than his iconic role in Goodfellas, and he is truly outstanding. I was so glad that his character got so much screen time in this because he was by far my favorite, heavily outshining even both De Niro and Pacino. Those two are good, don't get me wrong, but Pesci is just stunning and deserves the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, without question. It's one of the best performances in a mob movie I've ever seen. He has so much screen time, and in every single clip or image, he is 'perfect'. every look he gives, every line he delivers is nothing short of perfection.Even though De Niro and Pacino are very good in most of the scenes, I thought Pacino could have toned it down a little bit in some of his scenes. He does in fact give the old, vintage Pacino acting you have come to expect. It's not totally bad, but I would say he was the weakest link of the main actors, and I still love his movies and he is one of my favorite actors.DeNiro excels in the final half an hour of the movie, which sees him encounter old age and come to terms and closure with what he has done. This will probably at least get him a nomination for Best Actor.The final act (half hour or so) is worth sticking around for so if you get bored in the long run time, I recommend you stick around for it. It was a little sad and heartbreaking, but it was so well done, I really appreciated how Scorcese took the story to that 'place', rather than only keep it more superficial.Now, as for the drawbacks or negatives of the movie: once the first two hours pass, the pacing really slows down (and the film somewhat gets watered down into some mafia movie clichÃ©s) and begins to feel a little bit generic. It is in fact true that many scenes could have been cut beyond that point, particularly redundant one-on-one conversation scenes between Hoffa, Ed Sheeran (The Irishman) and whoever they were meeting. Regardless, it's never 'bad' per say, but it does become less entertaining beyond the two hour mark and is prolonged in a way that was probably unnecessary.Ultimately, I think this movie is definitely worth a watch one way or another. The CGI de-aging wasn't as much of a problem as some of the people who criticized it said. You do notice it at times, but you quickly get used to it and the story is strong enough that you lose focus of it.It's not perfect, as a whole (due to the length), but it is a 'good' movie, nonetheless...and it takes you out of fantasy comic book land for those sick of those types of movies. You get some interesting historical events in this as well that matures the story for mature audiences.8.5/10",9,8,18,28 November 2019
The Irishman," People Calling for Younger Actors are Missing the Entire Point and Substance of the Movie
","Of course there would be some CGI complaints based on the age and all, but people who think younger actors should have been used are missing the entire point of the movie; every main actor in this movie is a Legend. They earned that title through a career of heading up 'classic' and 'masterpiece' level movies that are among the greatest of all time.No 'young' actor alive today is anywhere close to their level for this genre. This isn't like placing DeNiro in the Godfather II since DeNiro was far out of the league of today's young actors when he was a young actor in the late 70s and early 80s. Today's crop of snowflake metrosexuals could never play dominant, masculine, testosterone-driven 'men' like these guys, guys with balls of steel who you believe. Maybe their high-pitched, estrogen-laden voices could somehow convince the viewer they were a 'boss', but it would be the same viewers who can't wait until James Bond is played by a female, which is fitting since real manly actors don't even exist anymore.But besides the fun banter, nobody could play these legend roles other than these legends themselves, and no 'young' actors could even come close to carrying their weight for these heavy parts.",9,7,16,29 November 2019
Creed," A 7th Round TKO
","All the praise director Ryan Cooglan has gotten is warranted and well deserved. HIs direction is really the spice and life of 'Creed'. The screenplay doesn't miss a step until two hours into the film, and that makes it nearly a perfect movie.I went into viewing Creed as a skeptic because I haven't been impressed at all with any sequels since Rocky IV. But the witty script, swift moving dialogue, and pacing will make you a believer.Michael B Jordan turns in a surprisingly impressive performance with shades of Denzel Washington's range, and Sylvester Stallone definitely deserves his award recognition. Stallone plays an elder Rocky loosely, having fun in the role, but also capturing the film's most dramatic scenes with poise and solid delivery.The story is really great. It has heart, which is something many films nowadays lack considerably. The camera-work, story, and screenplay make this one of the best movies of the year and arguably one of the top 3-4 of the franchise. Except that is the thing about Creed- what is interesting about it is it sets itself apart from the usual Rocky series and charts a new course and direction, making it its' own film and own series with lots of potential for the future.This movie is so good in a technical way, it's difficult to consider it a Rocky movie, and the most impressive scenes and writing all occur outside of the ring in day to day living. Witty dialogue, great direction, and a clever vision make Creed a surprise hit worth seeing of 2015.4/4 stars (10/10)",10,1,5,19 January 2016
Alexander," Underrated
","While it has its' fine share of flaws, this is a movie that was partially killed by critics prior to its' release. As a result, I went in with very low expectations after reading some of them when I rented it a few years later.I will say, the first time around watching it, I was a little bit confused at times in that, like the critics said, it's not what you would expect from an 'epic' movie about a military war hero, and with Oliver Stone directing it, expectations may have been a little high.However, when you come down out of the 'hype', and out of the critics' opinions, and just turn it on exclusively as an epic film, if you are in the mood for one, it will give you what you want.On multiple views I find it refreshing as a result, and it gets better and better each time you watch it as you get out of the 'hype' and 'critics' mindsets.It's a wonderful 'adventure' story. We see Alexander lead his legions up against the Babylonians and venture across East Asia in the B.C. timetable. They run into typographical problems as they reach the Himalayas, but Alexander doesn't let his vision waiver and they press on into India, another foreign country that the Greeks knew not much of.If anything, if you pay attention, you get an idea of Alexander's mindset. Going against the orders of his commanders, he marries a Barbarian, crossing breeds that up to that time were taboo for Greeks, especially those of Royalty. The assassination of Phillip of Macedonia, his father played by Val Kilmer, reveals an inconclusive history as who the culprit was, although it seems the power struggle for the throne was probably brought about by his mother, played by Jolie.Angelina Jolie was fun to watch in this, even though it wasn't her best performances. Her crazy character was definitely a highlight and she is always eye candy in her prime here.If nothing more, this is an ambitious (like Alexander), long, adventure movie, watching the struggles of Alexander the Great's conquest of the known world that mixes in some subtle political and philosophical ideas that makes you think a little bit more than you expected going into what appeared to be a classic epic movie. It's long, but that's one of the reasons I've come to like it- it's the perfect movie to put on right before you go to bed- it's good enough to entertain you, hold your attention, and make you think, but long enough to put you to sleep.A very underrated epic film destroyed by hype and critics. In its' own way, it has 'greatness', but you have to look past its' flaws in order to find it.",8,3,6,20 June 2015
The Natural," Classic sports film about how to achieve and handle fame and stardom
","1. Discover your talent/gift, but also work hard to develop it 2. Beware of women when you succeed and make it 3. When life sidetracks you, make a comeback 4. Believe in yourself and your talent 5. It's never too late to live your dreams and up to your potential 6. Beware of the friends you keep 7. Love and family are more important than fame and fortune if it means loneliness or health risks; know when to walk away. 8. Remember what your father taught you 9. Having the right woman by your side who loves you for who you are is better than the wrong one who only loves you for the money and fame 10. Fame and fortune have a way of changing people from their home grown roots; remember where you came from.These are ten tips of wisdom contained in and taught in the Natural. Not many films go for worldly wisdom in such a natural, easy to follow, and realistic way, but the Natural builds its' whole story and characters around it. This film has heart, superb acting, lines you can memorize, and is lots of fun if you're a baseball fan.It also has an incredible, star studded cast of great actors: Redford, Duvall, Barbara Hershey, Kim Basinger, Glenn Close, and at least three other lesser known, but well respected actors. It's as much about baseball as it is about how to gain and handle success.",10,1,3,31 May 2016
Spotlight," Good, but Overrated B Movie
","I just watched this movie. Once is enough. It's a very good 'B' movie, but I found it overrated and over-hyped. It wasn't bad or anything, but just a solid low budget film.The cast really gave it their all, and I would praise them for their performances, especially Ruffalo, McAdams, and my favorite was actually Schreiber, who I'm surprised was overlooked (maybe he didn't have enough screen time here).The fact is that in my humble opinion, this film was boring because it was very repetitive. It was just one reporter after another constantly sitting down with a new victim or lawyer or knocking on a door or sitting down in the office discussing the case. There was little suspense that proposed any truly dramatic effect on the characters. For example, in a similar film, see The Insider about the nicotine investigation and whistle blower, where Michael Mann uses threats on his main characters' life and family to elevate the tension and drama. The effect is much more compelling and riveting.That's not to say that what they provided wasn't sufficient, but there was ultimately no escalation in climactic events, and that's where this redundancy I mention became apparent. I found myself looking at my watch to see how much longer the movie would last because the scenes were also 'chippy'. What I mean by that is that they were all super short (seemingly 2-3 minutes multiplied by (scenes)=_____) in this repetitiveness.Bottom line: I'm sorry, but I don't see it. I don't see all of the award praise and favoritism. That's why I wanted to see it- to see if it was as good as what I heard, but it honestly fell short for me. It is a great low budget movie with good performances, but nothing special.",6,4,8,15 January 2016
Zodiac," Decent crime flick, but way too long and more of a 'run of the mill' type
","Fincher is among my favorite directors of today, and his craft is definitely one of the most redeemable qualities of Zodiac, but the movie is overly long and struggles to rise out of the 'run of the mill' type labels for crime drama mystery films. While certainly decent and worth a view if you haven't gotten around to it, it never really separates itself from what you'd expect from the genre. One crucial element that I think makes it pale in comparison to Seven is the simple fact that it's based on a true story, whereas the fictional element of Seven made it original and different. I also wasn't impressed by any of the cast's performance, but Ruffalo stood out and was slightly above average. It was decent, but I wouldn't watch it again or highly recommend it, especially compared to Fincher's more unique movies such as Seven, The Game, and Gone Girl. 5/10",5,2,2,6 June 2017
The Hateful Eight," Good
","The Hateful Eight is a dialogue driven film that is highly entertaining and enthralling enough. Of Tarantino's films, this ranks up there with the best, and in the recent years it is better than both Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained...by a mile, and they were pretty good. I guess the question isn't if this movie is or was good, but rather where it stands and ranks in Tarantino's best. I would put it just below Pulp Fiction, and just above Kill Bill Vol. 1, about tied with Jackie Brown, but surprisingly slightly better. It is definitely one of his best. Don't listen to the negative reviews. This is definitely a good film and I went in to watching it skeptical because I heard some criticism. One of the biggest was the length, but I actually didn't notice it really. It's long, but you just have to put up with it. I enjoyed the character developments, mystery, tension, and screenplay that extended the time. Overall, this is definitely a good movie and much better than Django Unchained, which also had a similar western style to it.",8,3,14,8 January 2016
Alien," One of the best science fiction movies of all time
","There are relatively few films in history that are so solid and well made that they are the definition of a 4/4 star movie. Alien is one of those films. Movies have become so flawed in recent decades that truly handing out the full rating of 4 stars out of 4 (or 10 out of 10 for IMDb) has become a stretch.Without a doubt, Alien is not only a classic and the best science fiction horror movie of all time, but it is also one of the best films of all time. It is one of the coolest, most bad-ass, and horrifying films you will ever see.Sigourney Weaver is phenomenal in the role that shot her to fame. She is the heart of the film and plays her part with a sort of innocence and naive youthfulness that is endearing and real. Who would have ever thought a woman could be so bad-ass in a science fiction/action/horror movie in 1979? This movie is so good shot for shot that you will be glued to the screen. You can't miss a minute, nor will you want to. Even after all the similar sorts of horror and sci fi films that have been made which have borrowed from Alien, none of them can put together what Alien did. Some movies just rock. They just know how to open,know how to show, know how to tell, know how to explode, and know how to end. This is one of them. The ending is perfect and a perfect example of how to tell a story and end a movie, something many films of today can learn from.",10,2,3,6 February 2016
Shutter Island," Sleeper hit
","When this movie came out, I didn't hear much about it. It sort of fell under the radar of top movies of 2010, despite having DiCaprio in it and Scorsese directing it. I'm pretty sure this had to do with somewhat of a marketing problem; with both top talents coming off the Departed, and Scorsese so stereotyped for his crime dramas, what is he doing making a psychological mystery drama? It just didn't add up on paper, and critics didn't laud it like they do with most of his movies (it only has a 63 rating on metascore).So after a recommendation from somebody on IMDb to watch this movie, checking it and seeing it was in the top 250, and finally having a little spare time to catch up on some movies I've missed, I decided to give it a try and liked it.There is so much to talk about, but to keep it simple, this is a movie for anyone who likes to think and enjoys being challenged when watching a film. In other words, Nolan fans will probably love this film. In fact, once it ended I could have sworn this was a Nolan movie. But, with that being said, I actually think Scorsese handles it better than Nolan would have. Scorcese has a more attentiveness to detail and is a true master at filmmaking. Although this is nowhere near his ordinary genre releases, he still has the master hand at nuance and his vision comes in handy for a film that might be less likable at the hands of a lesser class of director.The thing that I really liked about this movie is that it showed its hand early on. Anyone paying attention and with a basic intelligence will know within the first fifteen minutes, or at least suspect one of the big twists. But that's what I liked; because Scorcese decided not to hide it early on, it isn't actually a twist. He lets the viewer know early on, but the way he unveils what you are expecting with little hints and nuances here and there until it delves more and more into what you are expecting until finally it is as clear as night and day is an entertaining journey. This is so much so that you know there has to be more to it.Yet, he doesn't rely heavily on trickery; he is not trying to confuse the viewer. In fact, he is respecting their intelligence. He knows that they know, but there is still so much more to the story and so many more themes to be pondered, mentioned, and discussed, that knowing the reveal early on is just part of the perplexing puzzle. Now, he challenges the viewer in other ways, with themes such as medical ethics and psychological defense mechanisms. I also found a powerful theme being that for anyone with any sort of psychological illness, the implied key to healing is to 'face' reality, not run from it. The character must first admit the truth before they can make any progress and cope with it. The most interesting part of the story and scene for me was the flashback to when he was a marshal and came home to his wife because this was the first flashback that was real and explained the story. Here, we see the reality of what really happened so we finally know after all those twisted delusions that you're never quite sure how real they are, and suspect they might not be. There were so many layers on layers in this film. It is mesmerizing, well acted, and has several outstanding qualities, despite a few flaws. However, it won't be for everyone. This is a film that will specifically be enjoyed by people who really like psychological thrillers, mysteries that make you think, and movies that are unique and different. I recommend this as an overall entertaining movie. If you like this, you'll also like Identity, The Game, Memento, and Inception.",7,0,3,8 June 2016
Interstellar," Not So Stellar
","It's a pretty good movie. You'll be immersed in the visuals, the graphics, some mystery, and a review on quantum physics in space, and you will enjoy the mysteries contained in it. However, the acting and casting are almost embarrassing at times and poor. The narrative and script suffers greatly from a lack of focus and pointless plot tricks. There's a sequence toward the end that while engaging, is some of the most over the top dramatic, just-for-effects senseless filmmaking you will ever see. It worked in Inception, but not in Interstellar. Overall, it is a 'pretty good' film, but it falls short in so many categories. The visuals are worth the ride, and the best part is the presentation of the new planets. If only they would have spent more time on the water planet (that was the best part of the movie), but then if they did, every hour was worth 7 years on earth, so the story had to go elsewhere. The other graphics were good too. But there are some senseless plot turns that will frustrate you and it will lose points immediately from its' current 8.7 rating. For example, was Matt Damon's space crazy Dr. Mann even necessary? The answer when you think about it is no. It had no point in the overall story except to add more drama and intensity to an audience who already had plenty to begin with. What a waste of top level talent.",7,5,7,26 October 2015
Full Metal Jacket," Very good movie- A film of 2 halves: the first perfect, the second lagging behind but good enough
","I finally got around to watching this for the first time. The first half is a 10/10, the second half is a 7/10 and falls apart into what seems like every war movie's clichés, even though it's good enough. The first half is a masterpiece of filmmaking- there's almost no flaws, the pacing is perfect, the acting great, it has an instant classic type experience to it you'll never forget. The second half is good, decent but it doesn't rival the first half and its perfection. That makes its let down even more pronounced. So overall, I give it an 8/10 because you can't overlook the drop in quality of the second half. 8/10",8,3,3,7 June 2017
American Sniper," Stunning biographical sketch
","This is a biographical portrait of Chris Kyle, a Navy seal who had the highest kill total as a sniper and served in the Iraq war. Bradley Cooper gives the best performance of his career as stoic, self-assured Kyle and Sienna Miller, who plays his wife, does a good job herself. It's a well made docudrama that really conveys a powerful message overlooking all of the gun battles and that is: take care of your own; guard your flock, help your brothers. That is what Chris Kyle did to the end. Even when his duty ended, he was still assisting victims of the war and giving them hope and courage.Clint Eastwood does a fine job of depicting Kyle's 4 tours in Iraq. This film really speaks to the trauma and difficulties war veterans have and sends a message raising awareness to help soldiers who were wounded in battle.Very good movie. Sad story.",7,1,5,21 June 2015
Lion," Good, a couple great scenes, and one of the better ones the year has to offer, but not great
","Lion is a very well done film about a young boy who gets lost from home, separated from his family more than a thousand miles away. After several adventures and subjected to dangerous circumstances, he is found and sent to a couple from Tasmania who adopts him. They raise him, but he still wonders what happened to his family...The first half of the movie was well executed. The boy who plays him deserves an Oscars nomination as well All of the acting is top notch, even the Indian actors- especially the Indian actors.I mostly liked the first half more than the second. When it first cut to him as an adult, the film lost some momentum and some heart at first. A new film, it wasn't as interesting. But I know they had to lay a foundation down to get acquainted with the older Sheru. However, it wasn't too long until it got good again, and the ending was very good and well done. This is a good movie, almost great. It's based on a true story that really happened, and I would place it in the top ten movies of 2016 at about #7.7/10",7,3,4,8 February 2017

Nightcrawler," Disappointing despite good performances
","While Jake G. and Renee Russo give good performances, the story is really lacking in development. It feels like a movie that was originally 10 hours long that got edited down to 2.There was very little character development. Like, we're supposed to just know all the characters where they are and accept them as is. This creates no deep connection between viewer and character- very superficial. As such, you never get quite a feel for the characters.It wasn't a bad film. In fact, it keeps your attention and was riveting at times. It was good, but very forgettable from a great movie standpoint- it's one you want to forget, even though it isn't bad.Also, they could have emphasized the behind the scenes of the news room even more to make it more compelling and intelligent. They delve into that, and it's interesting when they do, but like the character development, it's very superficial and shallow compared to where they could have taken it. It felt like the cliff notes of a movie that could have been much better.The final setup scene was anticlimactic. The reason I say this is because it looked like this guy was on an epic filming endeavor, and for that one story to be the climactic one felt a little lackluster. Once again, it just felt like it could have been better for the climax story. It was also a little bit unbelievable.Despite this I would say it was still interesting and one of the better movies I've seen this year, which isn't saying much. It was just okay. I guess that's what's expected from Hollywood today.5/10",5,2,3,17 June 2015
Baby Driver," Fun action-crime flick that is unrealistic and a tad bit overrated
","Is it a fun movie? Besides the boring parts of it (and there are plenty of boring portions), yes. But is it an Oscar-worthy 10/10 or 94% score on RT the reviews and ratings would have you believe? No. Baby Driver is a fun, if yet awfully unrealistic action-heist-crime flick. While parts of it excel, parts also falter; it's not a perfect movie. The main character's driving strategy is a good metaphor for its quality: speed forward, hit brakes, then go backwards in reverse; it's all over the place. However, overall I did like it and it is good. I just don't quite understand how a movie this unrealistic scored so high with critics. Usually movies with this much deus ex machina don't fare as well overall. But if you are in the mood for action packed mindless entertainment, it does a good job in that department keeping you entertained. And it has some laughs mixed in. 6.5/10",6,14,28,19 August 2017
The Revenant," Must See Movie Event, But...
","I give the Revenant 8 out of 10 stars on here. That's good, but not great. It is definitely a must see film of the year as this may finally be DiCaprio's first Oscar victory, and because it is quite an experience. While it is definitely a 'good' film, it falls short of greatness due to a rather boring opening ninety minutes (except for a few short scenes) and a sort of lack of explanations for certain behaviors of its' characters. This is not a criticism because what it does present us does suffice, but simultaneously I felt like I would have liked to have gotten to know the other characters a little bit more, particularly the son and the chief of the village who goes to hunt for Fitzgerald at the end. Also, the beginning opening is rather confusing as it is hard to tell who is who and what is what, and why this is happening, despite a nice action opening.All that being said, I was not disappointed and would definitely recommend this movie. It is sort of a like a Castaway meets The Grey meets Dances With Wolves? Either way, it definitely deserves some award recognition. It won't be for everybody mostly due to the boredom that stems from so much time with nothing happening and the length, but if you can stick with it, it is definitely a good film. In all honesty, I found myself rooting for Leo most of the film toward the end: 'Come on DiCaprio, don't mess this up. Nail all your lines and facial expressions. Get this Oscar. Come on, don't mess up! You can do it. Get your Oscar'..",5,2,6,10 January 2016
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Don't Get It- 7.8 score? Oscar Nominations? 2011 Must Have Been a Slow Year for Movies
","Wasted enough time on this overly long, poorly edited, overrated movie that could have trimmed off about 1 hour and lost nothing of value, so I'll keep this quick.Even though Mara does give a good performance, and the unveiling of the mystery is suspenseful and captivating, this is nowhere near its score on here. I'm a Fincher fan, and he handles the material well on certain levels, but this is not one of his best movies, and is probably one of his worst. The locations and cinematography were the best components, along with Mara and Plummer's short screen time.Outside of that, this film is mostly a predictable bore. I literally knew right when he put the teacher from Good Will Hunting's picture up on the board, that it was probably him just by the sinister look on his face in the photo. I was hoping I was wrong and it would surprise me, but no, it didn't and I was right.The final 15 minutes were truly unnecessary. It regressed and went nowhere. Okay, so the girl's life goes on, we get it- no need to spend more time in an already overly long, excessive movie that needed to be cut down at least 45 minutes to be anything truly good. Craig is blah. I was never a fan of his; nothing personal, he's an okay actor, but his range doesn't impress me, especially here.It wasn't awful, but it was a disappointment.5.5/10",5,5,7,7 February 2019

","I wasn't expecting much with Dunkirk, but what can I say? From the first clip, it grips you and rarely lets up. It's a film that is tense and will have you totally immersed. This is a movie that is truly an experience. The visuals are awesome and it's a visual masterpiece. I'd put this among Nolan's top 3 films with TDK and Memento. I didn't believe the hype going in; I just wanted to see what it was about, and I was legitimately impressed. You will especially like this film if you like action movies, visuals, and intense movies. It's an experience, and the best movie so far of the year.

Aliens," Badass Movie, Worth the Watch, but Not As Good As the First One
","Aliens is an excellent action-packed, sci-fi movie with standout performances by Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biene, and Lance Hendrickson, as well as a solid supporting cast of marines, most notably Bill Paxton.Cameron does an excellent job directing, as all three acts are perfectly constructed. Once the action gets going, it rarely lets up and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The aliens are so creepy and scary, and the movie has lots of horror elements. Some great scenes are maximized by stylish camera work and slow motion that really make it stand out.All in all, it's a great sci-fi movie, but a little bit of 80s cheesiness and a couple of parts that were a little bit dumb in the middle made it have a couple of flaws, which is the reduction in score. I still think part I is better, but this is well worth the watch, and for a sequel it is definitely up there among the best.8/10",8,2,5,8 February 2019
Spirited Away," Good animated movie, but not a good anough movie to be #27 in the top 250- Too long, disjointed, and immature
","I have no idea how this is ranked 27 on Top IMDB Movies. I only watched it to try to discover why it was ranked so high. If you are not an animation-film fan, then it will have no value to watch. That being said, I really wanted to like it. It starts good in the first 5 minutes, but quickly becomes a disjointed fantasy world that doesn't really make much sense. Maybe this is just a movie made for children, but it's surprising it is ranked so high with so many adults rating the film.I would suppose from a technical animation standpoint, the art and visuals are great (I wouldn't know. In a way it didn't seem any better than Scooby Doo or the Flinstones I watched as a kid). The score is actually excellent, and that's the only reason I give it a generous 3. Oh, and the ending is decent, too- at least we finally discover what that overlong, boring, and disjointed adventure was all about. Even on its anime merits, this shouldn't be in the top 250, yet alone top 30 unless it was strictly an animation film or tv show list.2/10",2,3,9,1 February 2019
The Usual Suspects," Great crime classic- fresh, original, and suspenseful
","The Usual Suspects is one of the best movies ever made, but you won't know that until the final credits roll. While there are many good films that possess the potential to be great but whose ending diminishes their story and film quality (Chinatown, for example, in this genre), the Usual Suspects is one of those rare ones whose quality and film score actually both elevate due to its ending. All in all, you have a fresh, original, and incredibly unique film that still twenty years later separates itself from all others in its genre.Everybody likes a mystery, and The Usual Suspects easily has one of the best endings of any movie ever. The first time I watched it, I thought it was pretty good but nothing too special, but the ending was so fresh and original that it immediately became one of my favorite movies ever. Rewatching it, you appreciate the story and acting even more, and the ending never fails or disappoints due to the amazing editing and meticulous unveiling of the mystery. For me, this is an easy 10/10 because it's a well made movie that is totally different, original, and nothing was truly made quite like it before it or since.",10,1,2,4 June 2016
No Country for Old Men," Don't get your hopes up
","This movie starts out very good. All of the scenes are well done and shot at a high level. The acting is very good too. As the movie unfolds, it definitely keeps your interest and remains compelling. In the beginning, you overlook some flaws because of the amusement, good acting, and entertainment, thinking they are going to be a bare minimum. But as you progress towards the end, one major big flaw keeps arising, and it starts to become a joke and the film loses credibility. In a nutshell, ask yourself, 'How can a serial killer who has been known and found out from the very start of the film, in an age of radio, television, and phones just go wherever he wants whenever he wants and nobody recognizes him or reports him? How can the FBI and police force not catch up to him after all those days and weeks?' Haha. It's hilarious. If you think about it, it is one of the stupidest plot holes and oversights you might have ever seen. And this is just the tip of it. You can go into more details too. I say, 'It's like he's the 'invisible man''. Then there is how everyone he is out to get acts stupid and have no powers that most humans have intellectually. They lack reasoning skills. Moss, at times, does, but only at times, and eventually he succumbs to the stupid nature anyone who isn't a serial killer seems to possess. Lol. It's a good movie, but the lack of realism in the story that this guy just keeps getting away with everything is ridiculous and way too far fetched. Last but not least, you will absolutely hate the main character, and when you view the end, because you hate him so much, and watch him get away from law enforcement for the 100th time (like they don't exist Lol), there's a good chance you should and will hate this film. Still, professionally, it is a well made movie with good acting, cinematography, and overall interesting story so 6/10. You want to like these overrated Hollywood movies, but they just always seem to let you down.",6,1,2,21 November 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Pretty fun and entertaining popcorn movie
","An emotional ape film about the rise of a chimp named Caesar. It was pretty fun. To the extent that you wouldn't expect to care about apes and the movie makes you side with them over humans, this is a fairly powerful film. Underlying the drama and action are common issues like animal rights, domestication, and controversial ethics with bio-engineering that could have adverse effects on humans and animals, and therefore backfire.Overall, it's a good movie and I liked the end. Some scenes are really impressive and well done, but others are very cliché. The plot itself is fairly generic: science experiment gone wrong, advanced mutation/evolution in animal, counteractive contagious disease affects humans, animal displays superhuman strength and ability. That was the only major disappointment, all things considered, knowing the kind of movie it was. I thought the plot would be something different, even if only slightly tweaked, compared to other movies with a similar experiment gone wrong origin story.It's definitely not boring, goes by pretty fast, and was worth the watch. Have fun watching Caesar rise with his ape pals, especially the lovable orangutan and self-sacrificing gorilla savior, and be surprised when emotional apes can get you teary eyed.6/10",6,0,1,14 June 2016
City of God," Great Rental Movie Along the Lines of 'American History X'
","This is a great rental movie similar to American History X. Both were movies I didn't expect much of, but the narratives become so engrossing, you're surprised you hadn't heard more praise about them. They both ride tightly spun narratives and culminate with satisfying climaxes. If you haven't seen it, this is a great movie to rent and better ultimately than you'd expect.8/10",8,0,0,8 August 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 8/10. Liked it. Quirky, different, well-acted, cool, and fun movie.
","This is definitely a good movie. I just got done watching it and enjoyed it. There's not really much to say about the plot that hasn't already been understood by the publicity, but a few things stand out.DiCaprio gives a stellar performance as a Western aging actor on the downswing of his career, with many memorable acting scenes, some where he is acting within his acting.Pitt is also very good in his role as DiCaprio's stunt double. Robbie is excellent as Sharon Tate, and the other smaller roles are all played good enough.The movie takes its time in building up, and I've seen some people complain it was slow or boring, but I'll be honest: while I noticed a couple of scenes dragged a little bit, I rather enjoyed it, and it didn't bother me, for the most part.I liked some of Tarantino's creative choices and nuances a lot, but I did feel like there may have been a few opportunities missed to make it even better. However, with limited time and editing reasons, surely only so much could make it into the movie.I wouldn't mind seeing more of Cliff Booth and Rick Dalton's adventures through Hollywood in 1969. This one took the audience through Bruce Lee and the infiltration of the Hippies, but it seems like there could be even more to their stories.It's a solid film, and like one person pointed out: in an age of comic books and remakes, because the movie suffices on all levels, it was a nice experience to see something original.7.5/10",8,17,38,27 July 2019
Gone Girl," A new kind of madness
","I just got done watching this for the first time.It was good. The first 45 minutes were gripping, riveting, and almost flawless for this type of story. It was the captivating type where you don't blink- very good filmmaking.The next forty five minutes were good, but it changed into more of a comedy with laugh out loud funny parts, which while it was entertaining, from a critical perspective I preferred the mysterious stuff. Still, it mixed in the seriousness enough to not fully stray too far into satire.The ending got back to riveting, but I was someone who was anticipating a big climax of wacko proportions. While it was disturbing and captivating, it didn't end how I expected.Still, I have to give it props. This one will be hard to forget, and that's usually the case with a good movie. It reminded me a little of Basic Instinct a few times. Very shocking, insane, and the madness on display is of the utmost psychopathic levels, including Neil Patrick Harris' character.This movie took madness to an all new level and heights is my general analysis. Finally, I'll mention that I liked there were some undertones and depth to the story about how the media portrays things inaccurately and I thought that was a nice addition for modern day mystery like this. It's very true. A starlet writer is really a crazy psycho, goes missing, the media turns it on the husband, they kill him in the public eye, then she returns and they can cash in on book deals and the popularity. That is some nice depth there underneath a mystery film like this.Anyway, 7.5/10. Worth the watch.",7,1,2,25 October 2015
Django Unchained," OK- decent, but not great- overrated
","This is an okay-decent movie. However, seeing its' place in the top 250, I kind of got my expectations up a little too high. It will not totally disappoint, but it is not one of the best movies of all time.First off, surprisingly, this is a pure western. I was never a huge fan of pure westerns. That being said, as far as pure westerns go, this is in fact one of the better ones I've ever seen. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly comes to mind as probably the best pure western I've seen so I can draw my comparisons from that. I also actually liked the Quick and the Dead, even though most critics didn't, and that's a modern classic western I can compare it with, which also stars DiCaprio. This movie has more substance to it than Quick and the Dead, but overall, it's not much different. If you do have a thing for westerns, then you will probably really like this movie.There are some minor complaints in my opinion. Being that it is supposed to be a classic pure western type of movie, at times it felt like Back to the Future III in that the main character often acted like it was 2012 even though it was supposed to be the late 1800s. One scene that comes to mind is when he's wearing hip shades while they're traveling through the prairies to Candyland. A bigger example is how and why they chose to play rap music during some of the scenes, especially the gun battles. I found this silly and retractable from the setting of the classic old west. It was like a mixture of cultures and I really didn't like the choice as it almost ruined the setting in a way. What they should have done was just go with classic western music or basic suspenseful music. I don't like when modern movies do stuff like this. It ruins the authenticity a little bit and takes away from the quality and movie experience, especially when they used it in the climactic scenes and shootouts. Samuel L Jackson's character literally looked like an African American version of Biff on Back to the Future II. I was wondering why he looked so familiar and it finally hit me. BTTF III was more clearly stating that it was in fact a combination of 1990 and the late 1800s as far as blending the cultures of the protagonists with the setting; Django Unchained not so much. This was a flaw.My other complaint about the film is that it was TOO LONG. Please, use some editing. They could have shaved off 10-15 minutes EASILY from this film just on long drawn out scenes like the trek through the country to Candyland and the drawn out sit down meetings consisting of heavy dialogue. It wasn't the dialogue that was the issue and I do like the added drama and pauses and suspense, but for a film to be this long due to extra drawn out scenes so much is unnecessary. How the entire final scene begins with Django talking the transporters into the bounty and letting him go was a little bit far fetched too, but Im not going to discredit it too much as the writing needed a device to get him back on the road to Candyland and this will do. My issue is that again, it just took way too long to get this final scene going; I would have rather had the major gun battle be the final scene and just have Django rescue his wife and blow the place up there- it would have saved another 20 minutes.That being said, this was a very well acted and well constructed movie overall. Any time you have to recreate the old west, it's going to be a challenge, and for that I think they did a good job. Waltz was great again, and they had an all-star cast of supporting actors. This was some of DiCaprio's best work, but as I watched it, I really couldn't help but think to myself how much better his character would have been with Gene Hackman in that role. This is not taking anything away from Dicaprio's excellent performance, but I thought his character could come across a little more cruel if he wasn't so young looking. Still, Dicaprio pulls it off with flying colors.The best scenes are in the beginning and middle. This movie is so long that it sets itself up on its' own to have very slow and boring parts that as I mentioned could have been edited to make the movie even better. Still, it makes up for much of its' flaws with its' dialogue, acting, cinematography, originality, and overall interesting story. It's an okay film but sloppy and silly, and not one of the best of all time.",4,0,1,6 July 2015
Good Will Hunting," Good but overrated and overhyped
","It's a good movie; the premise is its best point, as well as the human connection between friends and relationships, but so many reviews on here calling this a masterpiece or one of the best movies ever made are way unwarranted and over the top. It's a good low budget movie with some depth and a famous role for Robin WIlliams, who won the best supporting actor Oscar. The script is good, but not great, the directing is slightly above average, it drags at times, and some little aspects of it are unrealistic. It's definitely good and worth a watch, but it's not one of the greats of all time.8/10",8,4,5,5 July 2019
Gran Torino," Instant Classic
","Although Gran Torino is not perfect, it is an extremely good movie that adheres to simple, proven-to-work story structure with a tight script, strong characters, heartfelt meaning, and relatable themes like friendship, nostalgia, life and death, and the American dream, in addition to having lots of fun with the contrasts in generations and nationalities. There are a few errors, and it's a shame because if it wasn't for them then this would be a masterpiece. It's still mightily close, and is still definitely an Eastwood classic and possibly one of the most important movies in recent decades. Beautiful movie with a beautiful ending.9/10",9,3,4,5 September 2018
Hidden Figures," Enjoyable, Feel-Good Movie With Historical Significance
","Hidden Figures is a decent movie about NASA and how in the early 60's an unlikely candidate, a black woman who is a math prodigy, helped to launch the U.S.' first astronaut into space amid Russian competition and tension. Kevin Costner gives a really fine performance that elevates the film. He steals every scene, and this is one of the best performances I've seen him give. In addition, Taraji Henson gives a strong lead actress performance and Jim Parsons and others contribute good supporting roles.All in all, in a year of a diverse batch of good movies and awards and Oscar contenders, Hidden Figures stands apart and differentiates itself as one of the best feel-good movies of triumph, courage, and achievement. After some more depressing Oscar contending entries, it's a breath of fresh air and could garner some late nominations for best picture, supporting actress, supporting actor and more. Still, it's just decent and is pretty cliché. 6/10",6,5,11,18 January 2017
1917," A Vapid Cartoon That Shows Once Again that Hollywood is Completely Out of Ideas and Originiality
","Out of ideas, they decide to do the one-take style that the Revenant, Roma, and Birdman did, but oh, for some sort of originality, let's just do it for war, and at that let's pick WWI so people don't confuse it with Nam or Private Ryan.Sure, camerawork looks good, kudos, but the shoehorning, lack of a script, mediocre acting, deux ex machina, no character development, and suspension of disbelief turn this into a sort of dumbed down cartoon of a war picture. The only emotional scene was in the final 30 seconds, Everything else, basically was implausible. The fact that some people are raving about and loving this movie shows that either a) the studio, Mendes and those involved have hired a bot army or shills to hype it up, or b) moviegoers are that desperate and dumbed down, but it's probably a combination of both, leaning more towards a) as the predominant reason.Plot armor like Commando, a ridiculous scene about milk, and soldiers administering dangerous enemies with nursing like they were their family member makes the whole script unrealistic and implausible.",1,118,235,17 January 2020
1917," An Impressive Cinematography Achievement With Mostly Paper Thin Writing; The Final Number is the Rating.....7
","1917 is definitely a decent movie, and yes, there is no denying that the ambitious 'one-take' filming method was very impressive and certainly an achievement, but the writing was paper-thin at times- not as much as Roma was (not that bad), but it had some weaknesses.Before watching it I glanced through a few reviews, and one in particular that stood out as ambivalent is the one I recalled, as I agreed with the reviewer's opinion that 1917 has every war movie cliché you could think of.Literally every cliché is in here as its main scenes, but there is something else I found even more bothersome than that, which is that a few of the scenes are actually dumb. For example, the two messengers witness a dog fight, and they actually identify their allies as winning, but a few moments later the plane they are pursuing is shot down and lands nearby where they are. Rather than play it cautiously, they immediately rush to assist the enemy out of the plane to try to save him. This directly leads to one of them being killed when the pilot stabs the one of them. I mean, what kind of solider in a major war would naively try to save an enemy without their weapons drawn and cautiously? This was very problematic to me.Another issue that I had once again pertained to suspension of disbelief, or implausibility in that the surviving messenger is shot at constantly throughout his journey with bullets just missing his head on numerous occasion. I mean, this guy has plot armour on him that is thicker than season 8 of Game of Thrones, particularly the episode, 'The Long Night'. Everyone around him is constantly getting blasted by bombs and bullets, yet this guy is just luckily and randomly getting missed. For one scene, I would be like, okay, but this goes on in every battle scene all the way through to the end. I'm not an expert on WWI, but at what point does the viewer have to say, 'There's no way this is how it was- that a guy can just expose himself constantly to gunfire, bombs, and hellfire, and not get a scratch on him?'Don't get me wrong. There is no denying that this was a good movie, but I couldn't help but feel those three main criticisms: the clichés, the plot armour/suspension of disbelief, and the thin writing. And pertaining to the thin writing, I understand that they needed to give the actors lines, of course, but every single dialogue felt like they had to put 'that' kind of scene in to make it feel like a war movie, and that's not to say it was bad, but just cliched.Speaking of the writing, if you are a person who mostly enjoys great, original dialogue and style, then you will probably notice this too. However, you will also be unable to deny how impressive the 'one-take' filming method is. Another thing to mention is that due to the thin writing, it gave off a very nihilistic vibe a lot of the time. I questioned often if there was any deeper meaning to anything being shown. The reason why is because it seemed like they were going for some depth, but the climaxes were not reaching any moral or lesson. Again, when the pilot was being saved, I thought, 'okay, he's showing that in war helping your enemy is noble?'...but then it results in a nonsensical death, and yet still it wasn't trying to say not to trust your enemies in war, either; it was just a random event brought about by being stupid by underestimating the pilot in an unprofessional soldier way for a big war.Finally, I have one other big issue with this. Toward the end, this stranger basically crashes the battalion's gathering, and he begins asking where the Commander is, okay. Not one single soldier asks him for identification to confirm he isn't some rabid dog or assassin. They easily trust him and give up the location of their head Commander. But that isn't all- that is just the very back group he first meets. As he proceeds to chase after the Commander, trained soldiers allow this maniac to just knock them over one by one without being suspicious of him or questioning what his problem is as he advanced through. But it doesn't even end there; when he arrives at the bunker area, or front line, he continues to ask where the commander is, and the other captains continue to immediately comply with his request, giving up the location of their Commander to a stranger like it is no big deal. Seriously? What if he was an assassin? Nobody asks for his identification or why he wants the Commander's location.....Oh, that is until he finally arrives outside his door. It is finally THEN that they make a big deal about what kind of a threat he can be. I had big problems with how this scene was set up. We're supposed to believe the Commander of the entire mission is supposed to be that simple and easy to get to when being pursued by an outside low ranking soldier?On a plus note, I liked the very end and thought most of the movie sufficed as entertaining and a decent watch. However, I would NOT qualify this as a Best Picture favorite at the Academy Awards due to said issues. It had beautiful filming and beautiful shots, but the writing came up cliched and short of what it should require.-1 (Little character development/thin writing)+9 (Cinematography/One-Take choreography success) -1 (Cliches/Suspension of Disbelief/Plot Armor)= 77/10",1,76,203,7 January 2020
1917," This Winning Best Pic Will Only Prove How Much Hollywood Has Declined in Quality in the Past 2 Decades
","First of all, let me qualify my rating of a '1' as a counter response to this junk being considered as the 'frontrunner' for Best Picture at the Oscars and ranked #51 currently on the top 250. It's really about a '6'-'7', but many of the reviews and gushing that has occurred with this average movie are irritating and untruthful.Many years ago, a friend of mine got me to watch the movie 'Atonement', which I had heard of but never saw before, and I was surprised a good portion of it had a lot to do with the WWI time period. Some of the more memorable scenes in that movie which made it stand out were based on events in WWI. While I didn't love Atonement, I could at least see why it was nominated for Academy Awards because it was artistically written and filmed with several layers and themes that stuck with you, at least for a little while after watching it. Well, Atonement never won any major awards, despite the nominations, perhaps justly so as although it was a pretty good movie, it wasn't all that.Saving Private Ryan, arguably the greatest WWI-II time period war movie ever made also did not win Best Picture at the Oscars. Both of these movies are at least twice as respectable and good as '1917', which except for the impressive one-take filming method, comes across often as implausible, dumb, banal, and believe it or not actually laughable at times with how ridiculous some of the scenes are. This movie actually borders on 'Commando' territory with the main character's plot armor, and that's only one point of many with what is wrong with it.To even consider this movie in the same league as SPR is laughable in many ways. Even a movie I didn't like too much like Atonement, at least it had some depth and an actual script with character development. This war movie, 1917, has practically nothing except for the one-take clever achievement.It actually 'tries' to add depth, but it fails when it zeroes in on implausible and cheesy scenarios with the milk-baby scene, the Indian winding up in the back of the truck just for PC-oriented people, and a superficial yet disappointing attempt at tying in themes of family and moral dilemma, especially during the final act. The way it handles these attempts at depth truly comes across in a manner in which it seems like the 'target audience' of this movie is Marvel comic book fans and teenagers. The visuals are great, but it has basically no depth at all. It cheesily places good actors in 'cameo' roles, when their acting gravitas should have been used in major roles somehow to add credibility to it, instead.I just can't believe the Academy might stoop so low as to hand this Best Pic when it really has a weak script and writing. It would only validate the fact that the quality of movies Hollywood has been producing the past decade or two has fallen officially so far as to reward borderline-Marvel-comic book films that play out like video games for teens as its Best Picture.",1,9,20,9 February 2020
Donnie Brasco," Absorbing, Understated Mafia Drama Due to the Genre's Most Popular Hits
","This is an absorbing film based on a true story about how Joe Pistone, an FBI agent, infiltrated the mafia in the 1970s in New York City.It is the first modern era film that is based on this kind of infiltration. Since Donnie Brasco, many movies have used this same formula using an undercover agent to partake in organized crime takedowns, but it was really Donnie Brasco that started, or at least rejuvenated, this form of the genre.The only reason I can think that it is only a 7.7 on IMDB is probably because this mafia genre has incredibly high expectations for it with the likes of The Godfather(s), Goodfellas, and even Heat. It doesn't pack the punch that those movies have and is more subdued in its delivery, but the pacing is impeccable and there is barely a moment in the entire runtime that is even a momentary letdown, which is rare. Donnie Brasco goes in a different direction than these films, focusing distinctly on the impact the job has on Joe Pistone's marriage, as well as the relationship he unionizes with 'Lefty', in a groundbreaking role by Al Pacino, who plays an over-the-hill, stagnated, and somewhat desperate, made mafia member who feels unappreciated and disrespected to a level that deep down inside he wants out of it.Not only are the performances all solid throughout, particularly from Pacino, Ann Hesche, Michael Madsen, and Depp, but the writing is excellent and the musical score is emotionally stunning. Anyone who is a fan of the genre or classic movies in general will definitely not regret watching Donnie Brasco, a top 25 movie here. It's a 9/10, but I'm giving it a 10/10 since compared with what the average movie is today or in the past twenty years, Donnie Brasco is way above them in heart, originality, execution, and acting talent.",10,1,1,15 June 2020
Silence," Powerful, meditative religious epic on struggles with faith and persecution by the master Scorcese
","Silence is an incredibly well made film about the struggles of early Japanese Christians in the 1600s against religious persecution. Martin Scorcese directs a near masterpiece of a film, beautifully shot, with powerful scenes and good all- around acting. His depiction of 17th century Japan is absolutely stunning, and the story is easy to follow despite the clashing of languages. Gar field and Driver are sent from Portugal to find Father Fierera, who is feared to have renounced his faith among the persecuted Christians. What they discover is the hostility towards Japanese Christians is violent and intolerant. It's a story of the struggle of faith and how far would you go to remain true to your faith and beliefs. In the end, the answer might not be what you would expect. How the inner belief differs from the outward profession is brought into discussion as the consequences of nonconformity to cultural absolutes enforced by the empire's oppression of foreign religious sects may undermine their cause. A well-made movie on many fronts, Silence is unique and comes off like a spiritual, exploratory epic and a work of art with much more depth and insight than most movies this year. It seems like a movie that could have been shot in the 80s as it has an older feel and ambiance to its staging, pacing, cinematography, and characters.While the movie is long, it is mostly engaging, and although the pacing is slower, it still maintains your interest in this reflective, introspective epic.8/10",8,18,34,22 January 2017
Logan," Great moments, but too stuck in fantasy to separate itself from typical comics
","If this movie just could eliminate the fantasy comic book, unrealistic type of parts, it would have been near perfect. But the unrealistic comic book stuff brought it down two pegs. It was really unnecessary except to cater to the fans' expectations and desires.If it wasn't for that stuff being included, I'd give it an 8, but because that stuff kept reminding me this was unreal fantasy comic book stuff, I have to reduce it because I just can't take it seriously. That's ultimately what made The Dark Knight so great; every fantasy-comic book unrealistic thing was explained and made to be real and believed. 6.5/10, and that little girl deserves an Oscar nomination.",6,3,8,20 July 2017
The Insider," Good Acting. Solid Film
","This is just a well acted film that has a solid, no bull-s--- way of storytelling to it.The only thing lacking in it is any explosive scenes. The most explosive scene to me was when Crowe is called into the office and they threaten and blackmail him, but besides that there are not many memorable, strong scenes.However, that's okay if that's the kind of story it is. Instead, it is driven more by dialogue, acting, and 'based on true events' story, that had major ramifications.Crowe was outstanding, and really pulls off some incredibly good subtle acting- it's a quietly brilliant performance. Pacino was very good, as usual.There needs to be more movies made like this. It's just solid and 'GOOD'. From Michael Mann, what do you expect?",8,1,1,18 June 2015

","If you strip away the fact that this is based on superheroes wearing masks and costumes, you will extract one of the most honest, insightful, and profound takes on the duplicity between society's perception of a hero and what a true hero actually is....and everything in between that creates or destroys one. This movie is an undeniable profound masterwork that absolutely exceeds expectations and transcends the comic book genre into profound philosophical themes that are not only unexpected, but actually present a pristine depiction of their impacts and ramifications. This isn't a comic book movie in the end, but it is rather a very deep and analytical view of good vs evil, purpose, the meaning of life, and morality.",10,5,8,30 September 2019
The Dark Knight," Exceeds Expectations
","When you go to a movie surrounded by hype, it's easy to be let down. I'm not a die hard comic book movie fan by any stretch so I wasn't prepared for the spectacle that is by far one of the top 3 films of the 2000s, if not #1.How this film wasn't nominated for Academy Awards is beyond me, but it likely had something to do with the comic book genre.Well, this film transcends all comic book film expectations and is one of the best crime thrillers I ever saw. The entertainment value is so good it's shocking. It has everything you can ask for in a summer blockbuster, and boy does it deliver.Heath Ledger gives the performance of a lifetime as his psychotic Joker, which is deeper and unlike any Joker we've seen to date. Gary Oldman is absolutely shining in his reprising role, and Christian Bale is perfect as his sympathized Bruce Wayne.With unexpected plot twists, incredible character introductions, and philosophical undertones, this dark, disturbing psychological study of psychosis and narcissism, combined with its' high level drama, suspense and riveting performances will leave you thoroughly satisfied.There aren't really many perfect movies, but the Dark Knight is mighty close.10/10",10,0,2,20 June 2015
Reservoir Dogs," A Crazy, Good Movie
","Finally, while catching up on some popular movies I've missed, I got around to Reservoir Dogs. Luckily, the run time was only 1 hour and 40 minutes so I knew I could manage even though it took a few days to find the time for it after renting.So much has probably been said about this since it came out so long ago, but in a nutshell, this is a very good, classic crime drama that probably has inspired many movies and shows of the same genre since it came out. Everything is well-put together from the acting performances to the directing and writing.It combines a kind of 'who-done-it' with some vintage, gritty Tarantino dialogue as a group of thieves deal with the fallout of their heist getting busted by police while camping out in some vacant building. The big question looming as it is apparent there must have been someone who was an informant in their group and they are consequently all now in jeopardy of being caught is 'who is the rat'?The fast-moving, well-edited film combines flashbacks with the present moment to put together how it all went wrong, leading to a shocking final conclusion that makes you, as a viewer, feel like you got your money's worth.Yes, Reservoir Dogs is a classic.8.3/10",8,1,2,28 January 2019
Total Recall," Too Intelligent and Artistically Elite to Be a Netflix Original or 2010's Hollywood Production
","This movie reveals everything that Hollywood no longer is, exposing all of its flaws, clichÃ©s, bad scripts, horrible acting, no charisma talent, and boring movies.
But why wax poetic about what everyone knows current day movies are (or are not), which is basically krap.Turn back the clock to 1990, Total Recall is literally, literally a nonstop Science Fiction-Action thrill ride that is intelligent, fun, and loaded, loaded with world class talent. When talking world-class talent, you can just laugh at what we look at today especially in terms of actors and actresses. Directors and writers also are many, many steps down from where Hollywood was around 1990. The only generational figures in Hollywood today that even come close to the primary creators of this movie would be Nolan and....and.....I'll get back to that.Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin, and the writers and director are world class talent and artists. They don't get a job, collect a paycheck, and then give lame, half-hearted performances or work efforts. Each one of them digs in and allows their natural talents to shine, and the charisma on display both in front of and behind the camera is just palpable.Ticotin in particular really steals the show as an incredibly sexy brunette, contrasted to Stone's blonde beauty, who displays physical athleticism and a physical specimen for a body, as she runs, ducks, kicks, doges, punches, and fires her way through the Mars dystopia. I'd pay top dollar in a theatre to just see such an extinct, paleolithic Hollywood employee like her these days. She is a pure natural talent and beauty with such an array of talents that no actress in Hollywood of any recognition has possessed for decades.Speaking of which, Sharon Stone is also on another level. But it's not just her younger beauty and sex appeal only, which again seems just leveled up by what Hollywood considers attractiveness today and in recent decades, but it's the manner by which her vibrance and charisma come off the camera through her dialogue and athleticism.These are 'movie stars', not just actresses and actors. These were the days and times of filmmaking when an actor or actress were really what carried films, but not on their looks alone or just because they knew someone, but because they had world class talent, which is on an entirely other level. But the world class talent only happens because the talent is dedicated to working very hard to be the best they can be and give the role everything they got to the best of their ability.Arnold, in his prime, of course brings his A game, and from the start you can see his dedication to understanding the script and playing off of it and himself, something a 2049 Blade Runner Ryan Gosling could never do, for example (although Harrison Ford on the other hand, with his earlier lead in 1982's original Blade Runner can hang with the script and material to elevate the film).Lastly, there's the pacing. Yes, the pacing. Watching this movie and comparing it to so many films of the past two decades had me wondering if today's directors are just so pretentious and trying so hard to be artsy that their films come off as too long, poorly paced, boring, and with so many scenes that should have been edited out. But then again, it may be more likely that they are also just not on the level of talent they think they are- that of which the director of Total Recall is on. There literally is not a minute wasted, nothing drags, each scene is packed with important details and character development. As just one example, you only spend time with the bar characters for about five minutes total, but by the end of the movie you feel like you've known them so well and are pulling for them to survive. This is one movie that no matter how tired you are, you will not fall asleep on or even want to fall asleep and miss.This is not to say that the movie is perfect or the best movie ever made, not at all. The main point of the aforementioned review is to indicate just how far the quality of talent both in front and behind the cameras as well as on paper (the script is tight) has dropped since 1990. This is simply too entertaining a movie to ever come out of Hollywood today- it would probably be looked at as too much work, or they may CGI it out while forgetting to hire truly good actors, or care less to edit it down to prevent it from boredom. However, for a Sci-Fi movie, this is an extremely good film:10/10",9,15,19,23 May 2019
Don't Breathe," An entertaining, horror thrill ride
","If you're in the mood for a good movie and just looking to have some fun, Don't Breathe will leave you satisfied. Is it one of the best horror films ever? Not at all. But it is a new fresh take on the genre in 2016 and among the most memorable in recent years. It is along the lines and reminded me of the Final Destination movies. That's not a spoiler and not to say it's anything similar at all in plot, but it has that fun type of horror-thriller combination with young characters that it had. The great thing about movies like Don't Breathe is that you can't go wrong if you just are looking for entertainment instead of diving into anything that you might not be in the mood for. While the film contains a few major plot holes, it makes up for them quickly and within a few seconds, you forget about them. Horror is not my genre, but every now and then I run into a good one, and Don't Breathe is good. Recommended for even people who aren't big horror movie fans.7.8/10",7,0,4,21 October 2016
Sicario," Solid
","Sicario is a solid movie that is also unexpectedly impressive at parts. Anticipating a conventional drug-action film, I was impressed by the visual styles and score. It was definitely better than expected.There is only one slow sequence in the middle that lasts briefly. Outside of that, the film moves at an engaging swift pace, making it worth your while. I want to give it an 8, but as of now, I'll keep it just shy of that, although I would definitely watch it again if it ever was on TV.Most impressive were the Juarez scene towards the beginning and the final tunnel scene, where Del Toro takes over on his mission. 'You should go back to a small town where the law still holds true. You're not a wolf. And this is the land of wolves'.7.5/10",7,0,1,22 June 2016
Pulp Fiction," Lightning in a Bottle
","So original, it comes off like an experimentational movie, but one that catches fire with absolutely brilliant writing, dialogue, and character creation, in addition to all-time standout performances by every single actor, which means the directing was also superb.Some people may still question what it's about because for the most part we have four different stories converging at various coordinates in a timeline loop that do not clearly have a meaning as to why other than to just have creative fun with the way it's told.You have a philosophizing, bible thumping hitman (Samuel L Jackson) finding his path to salvation and restored faith and theism while participating in the events that comprise the movie. This movie is perfect in so many scenes with only a few weak parts. It's loaded with memorable lines, and it was meticulously cared for into every last detail including the music and what dance moves characters should have in addition to the outrageously brilliant screenplay that somehow never slips over the top.Tarantino still hasn't even come close to this lightning in a bottle masterpiece.",10,3,4,9 February 2020
The Da Vinci Code," Sorry but I liked it.
","People seem to hate this movie for some reason, and I remember when it came out, it was really controversial in that it got many bad reviews.However, years later around three years ago I caught it for the first time on basic cable, and I honestly didn't see what all the criticism was for. Not only was it immersive and intriguing, for the most part, but it had a pretty powerful ending and reveal at the end. It isn't great, so maybe the hype was what triggered so many negative reviews, but it also isn't bad.I never read the whole book, but understood the premise. If you really want to enjoy this film, you probably should set the book aside and set beside any offense you may take as to the religious conjecture, and just view it as a mystery movie in and of itself. I really enjoyed the ending- the whole final fifteen minutes or so.7.8/10",9,2,2,26 August 2019
The Untouchables," Great Movie Except for the Usage of the Score
","You can see where this movie can be criticized. Some of it is warranted, but not all of it. Seeing this movie recently for the second time refreshed my experience and had me realize that my biggest gripe with it is the score, which is so over the top and cheesy at the worst times.The one scene in particular where it just does not fit is the bridge shootout: as the good guys are riding their horses up towards the bad guys, the music is so loud and obnoxious in the corniest way. Remarkably, the scene is actually very good, but the music turns what would be a gritty and even more intense scene into some kind of heroic, melodramatic celebration of these mighty men of honor taking out the bad guys.Other scenes also have it wrongly placed and times, and it just made me think of how the movie would be better served without the score blaring overdramatically at many of the best scenes. It really would be better and probably less manipulative and more realistic. Other than that, I think this is a very good movie.",8,3,4,1 June 2019
The Witch," Not very good
","A pretty much paint by numbers horror movie that was popular this year so I gave it a try. If you are a horror movie fan, of course you will like it somewhat. But it didn't work for me. For one, I wouldn't even really consider it horror. It was eerie, creepy, and suspenseful at times, but it never quite scared me in a way that many horror movies have. There's really not much to talk about here. The only part of watching this movie I really liked was that it was only 90 minutes long. The first half was much better than the second. The final half hour just dragged and went by very slow in comparison. It's hard to understand what the actors are saying so that doesn't help, but beyond that, it just wasn't a good movie. This is one of the lowest scores I've given. The only reason it doesn't get a 1 is because it tried so a 4 is for effort and some effective suspense. Don't get your hopes up.4/10",3,1,4,29 June 2016

","Phenomenal film about the CIA's hunt for 9-11 mastermind Bin Laden who murdered 3,000 innocent people in the World Trade Center attacks.This movie is an absolute masterpiece. The way they depict the set of events and details that led to the discovery of Bin Laden's whereabouts is masterful, and the actors even turn in powerful performances to boot.This could have been an all out action movie without any character development and without any details, but instead it turns in a few masterclass performances and takes you through some of the key players behind the scenes in the decisions that led up to the ultimate mission that hunted down and eventually killed the coward who hides in his room and gives orders to mentally ill jihadists to kill innocent people.",10,1,6,17 June 2016

","What a movie. This is one of the best technically made movies that I've seen in quite some time. I really liked it...until the end. The first two hours of the movie were a masterpiece level experience, but in the final twenty minutes or so, it all comes undone and unravels. (I kind of had a feeling this was too good to be true throughout the first two hours, and that's not a bad thing as it reveals just how good I thought it was throughout). This is a movie that if it had a great ending, it might have been one of the best movies of all time, but it falls into mediocrity in the final twenty minutes. I wanted a summary in the end, a round up of the purpose of the greatness that had come before it, something new that had yet to have been revealed, but instead it felt like a reiteration of everything that was already shown, which was that Plainview was an a-hole. It was good, but due to the disappointing ending, can't say I'm a big fan overall, but the first two hours of the movie were truly spectacular and some of the better filmmaking I've seen in a while.",7,1,3,7 June 2016

The Wolf of Wall Street," One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen in 40 Years
","8.2 Rating for this tripe? Wow, did the sheep get caught in the echo chamber and herd for this one! They heard, 'Oh Scorcese! Oh Leo DiCaprio! Oh Jonas Hill!' and they all fell for it! Haha! Suckers! They got sucked into it just like Jordan Belforte sucked all his clients in! That's the only thing funny about this garbage.And please, don't try to pretentiously turn this movie into some kind of moral message, or some kind of hipster perspective on it because there is nothing deep, profound, or any message about it.Looking back on it, this is one of the most insulting films I've ever seen, and not because of the adult content at all, but because it was really a bad movie. The only part I even remember was DiCaprio high on Quaaludes and having a hard time crawling out of his car and up or down the stairs- that was actually funny to see, but that's it. Sure Robbie spreads her legs in the skirt, woopedy doo, nice meme for the vapid millennial generation.Everything else was pure garbage. And another thing: DiCaprio looks nothing like Belforte. Belforte has an alpha male suave about him when this was going on in real life, while DiCaprio is just playing DiCaprio, and I didn't believe for a minute he was capable of being in charge at that corporation. This whole thing is awful.If you want to see a more subtle and intellectual take on the very important topic, then just watch the far superior 'Boiler Room' with Giovanni Rabese, Vin Diesel, and those guys from around 2000. It is much more intelligently made and still portrays all of the same material, but just with a little more realism and subtlety.It should be in the Bottom 100 worst movies ever made!1.5/10",1,7,12,19 December 2019
Jaws," The true definition of a classic movie
","Jaws is a movie you can see one hundred times and it never gets old or fails to entertain in the way it had its first time. In fact, you love it more and more with each view. There is movie magic in this film that is almost divine. It almost feels like an artist throwing everything up against the wall and miraculously the material forms itself into some kind of vintage masterpiece. Where the movie really sets itself apart from the rest is in the final third, where it breaks all horror conventions by somehow formulating an iconic interaction of the three contrasting characters, all likable: Hooper, Quint, and Brody. The scenes the three of these have together are some kind of an ideal in filmmaking- they're raw, improvised, and each actor completely takes control of their characters in a way that makes the contrast feel even more real. It makes for great scenes, effective drama, and every moviegoer's favorite- memorable, quotable lines and dialogue. Shaw not receiving at least a nomination might be one of the top three biggest snubs in Academy Award history. His two iconic monologues, especially the Indianapolis, are among the most memorable in movie history. In fact, he not only should have been nominated, but he probably should have won. A classic movie, more rare than ever before in recent decades, is one you can watch over and over and never get bored or tired of it. It entertains constantly and finds a special place in your heart. It contains some sort of magic, perhaps with Jaws it is originality or just that raw, risk-taking filmmaking that just sticks, and you just can't seem to change the channel whenever it's on. It withstands the test of time and dozens of views. That is a rarity.",10,7,11,4 July 2016
Inception," A Mind Bender
","Good mind-twister of a film with good performances from all of the actors, particularly DiCaprio. Nolan gets innovative here, and for the sheer ambition of the film deserves credit.This is definitely a solid film that is worth the watch, but one that after you step back to think about it after all the technical shock value, it doesn't really stick with you. However, it does raise a fascinating question about the future science advancements that might be possible with psychological manipulation for political and/or business purposes. Quite a thought to ponder in the realm of science fiction.7/10",7,0,2,16 July 2015
Arrival," Very good science fiction picture
","Arrival is definitely one of the better Sci fi movies that I've seen in decades. With an outstanding lead performance, and definitely Oscars worthy, by Amy Adams, the movie draws you right in from the opening with some quirky space alien- esque imagery and sounds, with swift direction taking you into a world you've never known. It delivers enough scientific and intelligent material to challenge the thinking type viewer, unraveling the mystery without too much lengthy exposition. It will make you think and will grab all your attention. Intertwined with periodic flashbacks backed by a terrific score, Arrival will also move you and touch you. While some of the material has been done before several times, it definitely updates the 'worldwide crisis' line of the story and even differentiates itself enough to stand apart from other movies that have done so. In the end, Arrival is definitely one of the best movies of the year. Believe the hype. 8/10",7,5,11,22 November 2016
Parasite," A good, relatable, and easy-to-access South Korean film, much like 'City of God' was for Brazil.
","Just saw Parasite for the first time with subtitles. For a foreign film from Korea, this is very accessible for all languages and audiences. The actors are all expressive, attractive, and do a really good job acting. The story has lots of universal, contemporary components to it of pop culture.For what it's worth, the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like South Korea's 'City of God', or something along those lines; what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed, well-written, and pretty gritty.It starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy, which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller, part mystery (without giving away spoilers).I wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating, but unfortunately I just could not. Sorry, but I had to question the ease at which the events unfolded, and that's not to say that it wasn't fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work, but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the 'perfect' range of storytelling. The same issue also arose in the second, back half of the movie- some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10.However, other than these two (fairly big- big enough to deduct two points) flaws, the script is practically perfect, especially for a foreign film. The writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate, immerse, and challenge your mind, while also keeping it entertaining. They added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made.I was hoping this would win me over for a Best Picture Oscar upset contender, but unfortunately, it just didn't quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility. It could still happen, but after viewing it with an open mind, it looks like it's between Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917.EDIT: Slept on it and decided I would still pick this over 1917 because at least it had a script with some meat.",8,18,28,9 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," One of the worst movies ever made in history, with good acting
","The acting is good, even great at times; let's get that out of the way. It's the only bright spot. But it's not enough to save this painful movie experience. Lubezki's camera work is impressive and a marvel. But after 30 minutes, we get the point, and there needs to be a good story too. Okay, so the story is a washed up actor on his last legs of sanity desperately trying to salvage whatever's left of his career, but at a point it becomes arduous to sit through. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. If it wasn't for the single take camera-work I don't think it would've gotten any praise or awards. Keaton is an 80s guy (gives a great performance in this by the way, award worthy, ironically), and this movie, if released in the 80s would have got 1 star, 2 max.the acting is great, but it's a painful, taxing watch that leaves you with ambivalence, at best, at the end. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch anything else. It's really a bad movie.3/10",3,2,5,21 August 2017
The Big Short," Pretty good
","After it won the PGA and became the front runner for the best picture Oscar, I decided to dive into the Big Short, one of the only nominees with a legitimate chance that I hadn't seen yet.It's a pretty clever movie, and probably is deserving of best picture over the other contenders. Unlike Spotlight, which is similar in the sense that they are both about uncovering fraudulent and illegal activities and both are based on true stories that occurred during the early to mid 2000s, The Big Short uses much more clever dialogue, camera-work, soundtrack, and humor to make a story that may have seemed boring and flat and turn it into an enjoyable film watching experience.Of course, it is not the most exciting of movies and it may be confusing at times for people who don't understand the Wall Street housing market lingo, but if you pay attention you will learn a lot of things you probably should know about, in addition to being exposed to some wisdom and inconvenient truths along the way.I was surprised at how good the movie was since all of the Oscar buzz has been about Spotlight, which I didn't find nearly as entertaining as this, and the Revenant, which I liked but does possess some flaws that would be difficult for the academy to overlook if there was another serious contender. I highly recommend The Big Short as one of the best films of this year and one that will not disappoint, especially if you really are interested in learning about how the housing market collapse of 2007-2008 transpired and took place.Bale gives a solid performance, Carrell is very good, the smaller roles are all fundamentally solid, and there is plenty of funny moments, lines, and humor sprinkled in so you'll get some laughs along the way too.

The Dark Knight Rises," Very Underrated Action-Masterpiece
","This will be a very underrated movie due to the amazingness of The Dark Knight. However, in many ways it is just as groundbreaking, philosophical, profound, and good as its predecessor. It won't necessarily surpass the masterpiece that the Dark Knight is, but it really comes awfully close. It is its own thing, and other than a few sequences midway through and towards the end, it is every bit a masterpiece of action-filmmaking as The Dark Knight. The way Nolan handled the introduction, background, and development of the new characters was a treat and very satisfying. The only difference between this and the Dark Knight really is that the weaknesses of The Dark Knight Rises are just more pronounced. With a few scenes edited out in the middle, it would be just as good. This movie has inspirational components to it, while The Dark Knight has more morality-oriented components to it. But they both contain bits of both.",9,7,10,30 September 2019
Black Panther," A Generic Superhero Movie Just With Skin Color Black Instead of White
","All men are created equal regardless of skin color, but this movie, which has gained critical hype that most superhero movies never get is made to seem like it offers something different than any generic superhero movie. Well, it doesn't. It's paint-by-numbers for the genre but like 'Wonder Woman', it differs from the norm because of skin color (Wonder Woman focused on womens' rights politically). But outside of this, it offers nothing outside of the ordinary, and frankly, I never liked superhero films outside of Batman, Superman, and seldom Spiderman.Just like my greatest concern with the vast majority of 'superhero' movies, my biggest concern and knock on them has to do with insulting viewers' intelligence and dumbing down the viewer by playing on a fantasy world that removes all scientific facts and logic of what is known to be reality. This could never happen. And I have to say that this was the one thing that made the one and only modern superhero movie a true classic back in 2008; The Dark Knight brought Bruce Wayne and the Joker into the real world, minus a couple jump scenes. This is pure fantasy and childish, only appealing to kids who don't know better, and it's manipulating them for that for their SJW agenda.This movie is racist because it is expressing black power over white people as a sort of utopian vision for the future, where white people are slaves to black people, just like Wonder Woman fancies a future where men are subordinated to women in power.Within 5 minutes, between the actors talking like they're reading off of the paper with no depth and emotion, and the obvious clichÃ©s, I shut this POS off. 5 minutes was more than enough of my time to waste on such tripe. But don't worry, I shut 90% of all superhero movies off within the first 10 minutes, even the ones with white people; the only difference is the ones with white people aren't nominated for Oscar awards and overhyped.This is nothing more than by-the-numbers comic book flick, but one that is unabashedly racist towards white people.",5,4,6,29 January 2019
Blade Runner," In Scott's Futuristic Dystopia, Less is Said, and The Film is All the Better For It
","Dialogue is a nice thing, but recently I've been watching too many movies with heavy dialogue, and I'm starting to get tired of these three hour long scripts as a result.With Blade Runner, less is said and more is achieved. Scott doesn't need words to accomplish a profound movie going experience. He relies on visuals, sound, and a pretty clever, perhaps ahead of its' time, set of the future.Blade Runner is a breath of fresh air. The action flows smoothly and with just the right amount of it, it keeps its' pace going without becoming boring.I just caught up to watching this film for the first time, and although going back to 1982 you might expect a lesser impressive future- sci fi experience since all the technology that has come after it, the movie really holds its' own thirty five years later. Some of it had that 80s action movie feel to it with the villains (the main villain looks like a Billy Idol clone straight out of one of his 80s MTV music videos, and this was the only thing I found annoying and strongly behind the time), but the film was definitely unique and original. The thing that sealed the deal for me giving it a high rating was the awesome surprise ending. That was cool.",6,0,1,27 July 2015
Life," Well-Shot Sci-Fi, Horror Movie That Will Pass Two Hours, but Leave You Feeling Like You've Seen It a Million Times Before
","This is a movie that doesn't deserve a review really, but since I just saw it for the first time, figured a quick one won't hurt.The best way to describe this film would be to say, 'it's all been done before'. This has all been done before. I want to say if this was made in the 70s, it might be groundbreaking, but there are simply too many movies that have been made almost identically to this to see it as anything special.It is a decent movie to watch. It's well-made, and it did hold my attention for the most part. At the same time, it felt very thin in key areas like character development and plot. It is shot well- the cinematography is good and the music is effective to raise the intensity. It flirts with parts and material that could make it an 8/10, but unfortunately as a whole it just doesn't quite sit well enough to be that good, and at best I can see a 7/10.However, all in all, there's just something about it that I didn't like, despite it not being a bad movie. Maybe it was the actors, maybe for all its' tech-shot qualities, it just seems like something I've already seen a million times before.5.5/10",5,3,6,15 December 2019

This is one of those movies where even the smaller supporting cast of actors are good. John Voigt even makes an appearance at one point. Still, Pacino and DeNiro are the ones who shine the most. Other than a prolonged boring scene (almost irrelevant to the plot), this movie is perfect. It has one of the best shootout action scenes ever. Right up until the very end, it stays at a high level.

Braveheart," It's a Masterpiece. Best Movie of All Time
","Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history, an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence, from suffering, to courage to love, in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.Telling the quasi-true story of one man's conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England, who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence, Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds, defy tyranny, and achieve justice, respect, and dignity against oppression.Although its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie, particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life, there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It's understandable, particularly for Europeans, how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history, but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it's a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not, and it's duplistic and hypocritical for the film's haters to dwell on this minor detail, but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.On this topic, one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles, and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert's history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland's independence.Without trying to get the history perfect, this movie is simply flawless. It's beyond flawless, really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power, but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.James Horner's score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie, and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene, without coming across as manipulative. It fits perfectly into every single scene it is used.There isn't one acting role that is not well-done. This is one of Gibson's best acting roles, and the guy who plays Edward II gives an outstanding performance.This is the greatest epic movie ever created in the history of Hollywood. A few years later, another great modern epic Gladiator came out and drew rightful comparisons to Braveheart, but while Gladiator is a very good movie, it lacks in the emotional depth, power, and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watching Braveheart.The final Act of Braveheart is one of the most powerful ever put on film. As a first time viewer, you really have no idea where the story is going to go (even as a repeat viewer it still holds weight). To this day, there is still nothing like it. Just when you think it's over or you know how it will end, it just continues to twist and turn, and then it closes with what is probably the best ending of any movie in history.In addition to all of this, the body of Braveheart is loaded with outstanding battle scenes, incredible editing, and great dialogue rooted in inspiration, political strategy, philosophy, and stunning human experience of love, desire, passion, suffering, and identity.When you look at the top rated movies on IMDB, it is laughable that comic book movies and good popcorn-fun movies are actually rated above this. This is without a doubt, hands down, one of the top 25 movies ever made, and in my opinion, it is the #1 best movie of all-time.This movie is a masterpiece.",10,31,36,4 August 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," Gibson Delivers Again
","One thing I've noticed with skilled directors like Gibson and Eastwood is that they know how to carve out a story, making it complete. One of the basic things a story must have is a structured act one, two, and three, and a solid end, which any good director knows is incredibly important and an opportunity to put the finishing touches on their work. With that being said, it's amazing how many movies nowadays fail at basic structure. Gibson delivers again with an unforgettable story about a hero who fought in the battle of Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa Japan during World War II. Gibson's arsenal now includes powerhouse films like Braveheart, Apocalypto, The Passion of the Christ, and now Hacksaw Ridge. The movie begins effectively as a love story and backstory of Desmond Doss before transitioning into acts two (bootcamp) and act three (the battle of Hacksaw Ridge). The contrast between acts one and three is so stark, it feels like a completely different film for each. Love and war? This contrast was a little bothersome and the film does have some somewhat cheesy parts in the middle, so it's not perfect. But overall, it's an awesome movie and I really liked the ending. It's really different. While the war scenes are what you's expect, some aspects of the movie are rare for a Hollywood picture. For one, most of the main actors, except for Garfield and Vaughn, are unknowns and from what I've read many are Australian. The ending was very different too, and that for me definitely worked great. And it just mixes in all these elements of faith, religion, war, and love all together in a way you don't often see. While I enjoyed the whole film, I was leaning toward a respectable 7/10 through the first two-thirds, but after the way it ended and viewing it in its entirety, I really liked it and rate it an 8 out of 10. Awesome movie and a must see. Possibly one of the best war movies of the last 20 years, but it's more than just a war movie. It's also a love story and inspirational. This is the best movie of the year.8/10",10,5,11,20 November 2016
Gladiator," The best Best Picture winner so far of the 21st century
","When I invest in watching a movie, I want my money's worth and my time's worth. I give the directors and actors a fair shot, a benefit of the doubt even in those I'm skeptical of, and I want them to pull me in. I want them to astonish me. Take me into a world I don't know, and make it hit hard. Move my emotions.Give me scenery, a stage of an ancient world, and perfect it so that I feel like I'm there. Then, give me a hero and a villain, give me an arc of the hero, and let me know their soul. Entertain me, but keep it smart.As fictional as a world may be, or as fictional as a story may be based on a real world in this case, make the characters' motives and emotions as real, raw, relatable, and justified as in modern times, or any time for that matter, and make them believable through great acting. Suck me in to this world, and keep me engaged. Make me feel like I'm watching a great movie, deliver the drama and climaxes.Gladiator is 100% pure movie. It's a spectacle. It gives you just about everything you can ask for in a film experience. It's a modern epic woven together in a way few films of the century have been. 'Are you not entertained?' Maximus yells to the audience. Thanks, we are. This is a real movie. It's the best Best Picture winner of the 21st Century so far. Only negative is: I just wished it had a better ending, but I've learned to accept it through the years.Recommendation: It gets better on multiple watches. First time, the action and spectacle can be so overpowering that some stuff in language is missed, but multiple views reveal it to be classic status.10/10",10,1,1,6 February 2017
Goodfellas," A Legendary, Perfect Movie That Must Be Seen to Be Believed
","Goodfellas might be the best movie ever made. The level of 'perfection' reached in it has only been seen maybe a handful of times. Scorcese operated on another level with making this incredible work of art.Talk about iconic, this film came out in 1990 and was an instant smash hit and classic. Several main actors were already considered great, but this movie may have cemented them as legendary. Even newcomer, Ray Liotta, who landed the role of a lifetime, became an instant star for his part among the veterans. DeNiro, Pesci, and the others all have an on screen chemistry that is unforgettable and rarely seen. Future Sopranos standout Lorraine Bracco also got her fame here, the part that paved her way for the future role on the hit TV series.Everything in this movie works down to every shot, edit, music, and lighting choices. Really, the only downside is that some of the source material is dark and violent; but it's based on the true story of Henry Hill, who spent his entire life in the mafia. This is what it was really like, and Scorcese does a fine job keeping it entertaining and realistic.Scorcese delivers a master class on filmmaking here. Problem is, nobody is ever going to match it; they'll just be too busy watching in awe at how untouchable his level of mastery is. Goodfellas is easily one of the top 5 crime dramas ever made, probably more like top 3, and arguably the best crime drama ever made. A must see classic.10/10",10,0,1,16 February 2017
13 Hours," Sometimes you just have to let an action film be an action film
","I read critic reviews on metacritic, and as expected many were very harsh in assessing 13 Hours. It's easy to see that these critics don't want an action movie to be what it is: an action movie. That's not a fair assessment. That's like watching a comedy like Dumb and Dumber and arguing it wasn't Shakespearean enough. You have to let it be what it is. Comedies, action films, etc...These aren't art or poetry films, but nor are they trying to be. They are what they are, and if you don't know what you are getting going into watching them (or you don't accept them for what they are), then the criticism is on you.Now, I knew what I was getting right when I popped the DVD in. I was getting an action movie from Michael Bay. Fortunately, this was not Transformers with robots flying in the air and talking, but was at least based on a true story. Refreshing.Yes, you have your 'Bayisms' all throughout, but to argue these things at this point from a critic standpoint is so cliché, you score no points dissecting them. Just let them be, as long as they are bare minimal and covered in smoke and gunfire enough that they are at a new low for his films. And that they were. No points lost in this for Bayisms. In fact, I kind of liked them here.So as far as action movie films go, this film is a slam dunk. It nails everything you would want and hope for. To say the action scenes were suspenseful and intense would be an understatement. You are glued to the screen in a trance during the majority of the movie and its gunfights. You can't even blink.What I found fascinating and totally relieved in was that some people actually did live. I had sketchy details of the events, but I swore I heard that everyone died, and I was really depressed to think that was the case much of the time. But thankfully, there are many who do survive, and that was not only uplifting but also a surprise. It wasn't a full blown ambush with no hope of survival at all.This is one of Bay's better movies. It's got heart, is based on a heroic true story, has some good actors, has some funny scenes, entertains, and has a nice ending. For me, it gets a high score because it is riveting and gripping and delivers everything you can expect and ask for from an action film, and a little bit more.8/10",7,2,7,27 June 2016
Sully," Why? A run of the mill, predictable, done before bore-fest, but not bad.
","Who cares? That's the question I asked about halfway through Sully. First off, it's as predictable a story there is. It only occurred a few years ago and in the first ten minutes, it's confirmed the story is going exactly where you thought: there's no surprises. For entertainment's sake, Eastwood effectively has to throw in a dream sequence where the plane crashes into a building before Hanks wakes up. Plane crash movies have also been overdone. Wasn't Flight just a few years ago? It was much more compelling and more unpredictable. But then there's just been so many flight films. The one with Liam Neeson, the Grey where the plane crashes, and too many more to name. The thing about them though is at least they were about more than a predictable plane landing. Hanks is, well, Hanks. He's not Sully, and is far removed from his Oscar caliber wins for Forrest Gump and Philadelphia. Wow, look at him jog in those scenes! He's decent, but no way should he beat out Andrew Garfield for Hacksaw Ridge. Speaking of Hacksaw Ridge, another biopic true story this year, it actually has something to say and a reason behind it. There's no way Sully should win a nomination over it in any competing category (voters take note). It's not a bad film, but is incredibly 'run on the mill', and like I thought before watching it, I still don't know why this was made into a big movie. It would've worked fine on Lifetime. The final half hour exits the clichés and saves it. 5.5/10",6,13,26,4 December 2016
The Martian," Snoozefest
","Maybe one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen, the plot is so pedestrian and drudges along at an incredibly slow, and predictable, pace.If there's one thing in a movie that can make me lose interest faster than anything else, it is when an uncreative lead casting choice is made, and that actor casted simply plays themselves. It is the most cliched and boring type of movie when this happens, like a paint-by-numbers film experience, and Matt Damon is full blown Matt Damon in this. As a whole, and considering the ridiculous length of the movie, he shows no emotional range at all. It's like watching a Saturday Night Live skit where Matt Damon is just hanging out on a fake space rock, being himself.There are corny, banal, and cliched attempts at humor to really try to make it a commercial hit, but this is stuff that used to be original back in 1990; by now, you've seen and heard it all hundreds if not thousands of times.The only reason I'm even writing this review is because this movie has an 8.0 rating on here, which should mean it is special or elite, and my cable service provider gave it 4/4 stars. Frankly, I would be more entertained watching paint dry than to sit though this boring, predictable, slog of a movie that feels like it was only made for grade-schoolers.5/10 (all five for technical and visual effects)",5,3,5,16 February 2020
V for Vendetta," Average
","V for Very Average. That's putting it nicely. It's actually pretty bad at some spots. Natalie Portman's acting was so annoying and over the top, I felt like she just walked out of a high school play (I respect her and like her talent, but wow was she bad in this). But that's just one aspect that was contrived.While it isn't one of the worst movies ever made and is even half decent in all, this film is not very good. First of all, it's cheesy. That's a rarity to say. Many films aren't so good, but cheese is something that you don't see much from 'acclaimed' films like this at #150 on the Top 250 on IMDb. It almost makes certain teenagers are voting (let's hope).All in all, this movie is very 'average', and nothing more. It's the type of movie if you've seen all the others and are caught up, and it happens to be on basic cable, you take a glance at for a few minutes and change the channel. There's nothing new here. Another masked crusader (not a likable one) who fights crime in a silly looking mask with a weird wig and embarrassingly forms a pseudo romance just for movie goers who need another element of entertainment on date night (because we know the movie didn't have enough depth as it was).This is the epitome of an average movie. 5/10 is the perfect score for this cheese fest.",7,0,1,18 June 2016
