Walk the Line," Joaquin's turn for the Oscar
","It's high time that the public and Hollywood's 'Who's-Who', recognize Joaquin for the great and versatile TALENT that he is. If this excellent movie effort doesn't get him the Oscar, then somethings seriously wrong with the Hollywood crowd - WE the Public see him for what he is, a fantastic personality with unlimited potential. He is awesome, and a SUPERB ACTOR - This year the Oscar belongs to Joaquin! - He should have received the Oscar for his incredibly complex character portrayal in 'Gladiator' - his depth of feeling and ability to convey subtleties is sheer excellence... this time, for his role in 'Walking the Line' it's a MUST.",9,2,6,18 November 2005
