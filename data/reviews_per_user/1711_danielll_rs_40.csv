The Blair Witch Project," Scary?! Is it a joke?!
","I can say that 'The Blair Witch Project' is the most disappointing film I've ever seen. I was expecting something very creepy and impressing, but that's what I saw: three annoying and dumb amateur actors (specially Heather Donahue, that doesn't stop screaming and groaning) who don't divide their fear with the audience. Result: I simply hated this film.OK, there are no special effects, but it isn't a reason to bore us. The directors expected to put the audience as a 'fourth character' but they couldn't come even close to this. Only the 'actors' were scared. Telling the true: Snow White's witch stepmom is much scarier than the little Blair witch, who doesn't frighten even a child afraid of monsters from outer space.Everytime I expected the night to come in the film, but nothing happened and the morning always came again.And the end? There's no end and we think: 'Oh! Why did I spend my precious money with this piece of crap?' 'The Blair Witch Project' tries to be a journey about fear, but it is nothing but a film that makes you feel dizzy.Don't waste your money! Avoid it at all costs!",2,0,1,3 October 1999
Requiem for a Dream," I've got it under my skin
","What an amazing, brilliant film this is! From Darren Aronofsky's direction to Ellen Burstyn's amazing performance, this is a film that stayed with me. At the end, I remember, I couldn't stand up and go home, and I couldn't sleep that night. It's not every film that gives you that.10/10",9,0,1,7 June 2003
Chinatown," My sister, my daughter
","CHINATOWN (1974)	****Some films are obligatory for a person serious about cinema. CHINATOWN is one of them. It is the best film Roman Polanski ever directed, and see that is not easy to be better than ROSEMARY'S BABY, REPULSION, THE TENANT and TESS. It is maybe the best mystery film ever made... Yes, tying PSYCHO and VERTIGO... Okay, so it is the best film-noir ever made- and see that is not easy to be better than THE MALTESE FALCON and DOUBLE INDEMNITY. The American Film Institute gave it a glorious place on their list of 100 best films of all time- #19, above the Oscar winner of that year (1975): THE GODFATHER- PART II. That's really fair, at least. CHINATOWN is superbly directed, amazingly acted and perfectly written- in resume, flawlessly made.Presented by Roman Polanski himself as a homage to the film-noir, CHINATOWN is admirable in every scene. The story is so clever, so intelligent, so complex, so carefully built that you can't say you would take something or complain that a thing should have been done this way or that... And what's better: the film isn't dated by any means. Now, in 2000, 26 years after its release, it is as impacting and jaw-dropping as in 1974. So today's audiences can easily enjoy this classic puzzle, if I can say that way.Telling much of the story is not only spoiling, but a crime. The basic is this: a LA private detective named Jake Gittes is visited by a woman named Evelyn Mulwray, who thinks that her husband is having an affair. Gittes thinks this is just another case, but then the husband dies in mysterious circumstances and there's something related to the city's water crisis... The story offers endless twists, but they are intelligent and always come in the right time, making you jump from your seat. Of course it calls for attention, but it is never confusing or difficult. Instead of this, it is tense, suspenseful and entertaining. The Oscar winning screenplay is one of the best ever written, combining classic mystery with some smart twists and turns. I'm not exaggerating, because everything on it is flawless, from the dialogues (with an unusual kind of black humor) to the character development. And Roman Polanski proves that he was once a master. There isn't a needless scene, a disposable character or window dressing. With great film editing, score and cinematography, the climate for a film-noir is perfect.Much of the merit goes to the acting. Jack Nicholson is amazing as always as Gittes- it seems that the character was made for him. Faye Dunaway gives another astonishing performance. She plays a multi-faced Evelyn Mulwray, sometimes cold, sometimes romantic. She's not the kind of character you can always trust in, but sometimes you do. One of my favorite scenes, not only in CHINATOWN, but in films in general, is the one when she explains a certain thing to Gittes: 'She's my sister, she's my daughter...' Not to talk about John Huston, in a key, memorable role, and a cameo by director Polanski.Perfectly crafted and always surprising, CHINATOWN is a classic and a masterpiece in every sense of the word. It is a film about ambiguity, or about the many meanings a thing can assume, and about the mystery that is human nature: a lover is not only a lover, a father is not only a father, a sister is not only a sister, a murder is not only a murder, a pair of glasses are not only a pair of glasses, a lake in the backyard is not only a lake... Everything will be solved (or won't it?) in the last scene, one of the most memorable moments of cinema. There's no score in the background, the camera gets out of control, just as the characters do. It's when one of the characters gets back to a place where his life was changed years before, and the story seems to be repeating. It's impacting. An unforgettable conclusion to an unforgettable film.",10,1,3,14 December 2000
Unbreakable," And you thought X-MEN was the best super hero movie
","UNBREAKABLE (2000) ***1/2 Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Starring: Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Wright Penn, Spencer Treat Clark.WARNING: THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS1999 was an unforgettable year for M. Night Shyamalan. A film called THE SIXTH SENSE came unnoticed, with no expectations, and suddenly became not only the second most successful picture of that year (the first was, of course, THE PHANTOM MENACE), but also one of the most successful films of all times, for the surprise of many people, especially Shyamalan. In 2000 another surprise came: THE SIXTH SENSE received 5 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director. Surprises were part of this film indeed, especially the disturbing, amazing twist in the end, that many of us will never forget. Shyamalan had much to celebrate, but soon he was involved with another project: UNBREAKABLE, with THE SIXTH SENSE star Bruce Willis. It became one of the most expected films of 2000 and when it was released... many people that were expecting SIXTH SENSE- PART II got disappointed with the result, because they wanted to see a film even better than the first and a twist even more surprising, and what they got was something very different.In fact, there are some similarities between UNBREAKABLE and THE SIXTH SENSE: the style, the cinematography, the unusual camera angles, the same star, the presence of a boy and the aura of 'a mystery to be solved'. But, even with some supernatural stuff, there are no ghosts that don't know they are dead nor a child who sees dead people in UNBREAKABLE. It tries -and succeeds- to mix two different genres: the cinema and the comic books, in an unusual and melancholic story of a super hero.David Dunn (Willis) is the only person to survive in a terrible train accident. He didn't even had a scratch, what puzzles the doctors and the families of the dead, but he let it pass and continues living his life, until he receives a note asking what was the last time he got sick. This note takes him to a weird man called Elijah Price (Jackson), a comic books fan and collector, who makes David see the truth around him. As a mystery film, UNBREAKABLE is terrific. Some events of the past and some tiny details serve as clues that make David finds out, little by little, that he is a super hero, a kind of 'unbreakable' man whose 'cryptonite' is... water, and he has a mission with the society. That helps him to find love in his family again, but some things are not very well explained yet.UNBREAKABLE is a puzzle, but not exactly the kind of puzzle THE SIXTH SENSE was. In the 1999 film the pieces took right to the end. Here the pieces slowly take to a conclusion, but there's still something hidden, what will be shown in the last scene. It's like a jigsaw that you're almost completing, but when you're about to join the last pieces you realize that a single piece is missing. The end was maybe the exact point of disagreement in this movie: some people thought it was great, but the majority thought it almost spoiled the whole thing. I saw the film in January and I still think it was an abrupt, but very coherent conclusion. There's no way to say what I want without spoiling the end, so as you've already been warned, here it goes: UNBREAKABLE has all the elements of a good comic book, so it might have a real villain. As Jackson's character say, the hero and the villain begin as friends many times and suddenly become enemies because of an ambiguous act of the latter. Here we have David Dunn and Elijah Price as two uncommon people, one being just the opposite of the other. The first thinks he is being helped by the latter to know the truth about himself. Well, he is, but not in the correct way. Price/Glass was just trying to find the exact opposite of him, but for that he had to... kill people, create disasters of epic proportions. He suffered all his life with his condition but Dunn/Raincoat can't understand that and becomes his #1 enemy. The condition of hero/villain, bad/ugly is so old as the world, and UNBREAKABLE portrays it extremely well. As in THE SIXTH SENSE, the film wouldn't be complete without the ending twist. It is a bit abrupt indeed, but not arbitrary.UNBREAKABLE begins as a quite cold film, but it started to stay with me as the charade started to make sense. Maybe this was what M. Night Shyamalan wanted, and he succeeds in building a beautiful piece of mystery. The cinematography is terrific and the unusual camera angles make justice to masterpieces like PSYCHO. The direction is great and the writing improves with time. If Bruce Willis was overshadowed by Haley Joel Osment in THE SIXTH SENSE, here he has place to show that he is a good actor, not a great one. The best performances come from Samuel L. Jackson (haunting) and the very talented Robin Wright Penn. Spencer Treat Clark isn't nearly as good as Osment, but he has some future. By the way, he takes part in the only out of place scene in the movie: when he points a gun to Willis- a scene that lacks credibility.UNBREAKABLE is not a masterpiece, but it is a great film. It didn't deserve so many bland reviews and fans of THE SIXTH SENSE shouldn't be so disappointed. Shyamalan's work is original, intense, surprising, suspenseful and even poetic and sweet at times. It was one of the few movies in 2000 that deserved to be seen on the big screen.",7,0,0,4 March 2001
As Good as It Gets," Great performances in a very good and entertaining film
","'As Good as it Gets' shows that comedies can have something more than laughs and silliness.Jack Nicholson (playing Melvin Udall, a very unusual man) and Helen Hunt (playing Carol, a very nice waitress and an ordinary person) really deserved the Oscar. I've already known that Nicholson was a great actor, but Helen surprised me. She's a wonderful and graceful actress; one of my favorite ones. Her character has the gift to change the life of a cold and boring man like Melvin. I think Greg Kinnear should have won the Oscar (he's much more better than Robin Williams).I can compare 'As Good as it Gets' with another great comedy released recently - 'Notting Hill'. They both show you the disabilities and the joy of ordinary people (even if he is a maniac man, like Melvin Udall, or the most famous movie star, like Anna Scott - Julia Roberts - in 'Notting Hill').I think this film wouldn't be very good with other actors, but it's a very human comedy and it had the attention it deserved.9/10",9,1,2,26 September 1999
Memento," The film that restored my faith in American cinema
","What else can I say about MEMENTO that hasn't already been said? It's wildly original, endlessly brilliant, unforgettable in all senses. I wonder how it didn't win Best Original Screenplay in 2002- Academy voters gave the award to GOSFORD PARK, a film I also loved, but you can't ignore a screenplay like that of MEMENTO, one that restores your faith in screenwriters.10/10- the second best film of 2001... losing only to MULHOLLAND DRIVE",8,1,3,8 June 2003
The English Patient," Wonderful love story!
","'The English Patient' really impressed me. I know that some people though it was boring and slow but, for Christ's sake, what were they looking for when they went to see this film? An action thriller? OK, there are some slow moments in fact, but it is not a reason to give this film a low vote. I am sure that those people are the same fake-intelectuals who hated 'Eyes Wide Shut'.'The English Patient' deserved all the 9 Oscars it won. It is much better than 'Fargo', 'Secrets and Lies', 'Jerry Maguire' and even 'Shine'. Everything on it is so wonderful that I watched it one more time. One thing that I can't forget to say is this: Juliette Binoche is just incredible! Even after winning an Oscar she didn't left France and keeps doing films there. That shows a great personality!I have said many things, but I can write only one sentence to describe 'The English Patient': a wonderful love story!",9,1,3,23 October 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," American Ugly
","SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT (1999)-- Grade: A-The year of 1999 was, for me, a hell of a year for cinema, especially the American cinema. Stanley Kubrick died, but he left his last jewel EYES WIDE SHUT. We came to knew new talents as Spike Jonze (BEING JOHN MALKOVICH) and to have a strong proof of others' abilities- Paul Thomas Anderson with 1999's best, MAGNOLIA. That was also the year of BOYS DON'T CRY, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, ELECTION, THE SIXTH SENSE, THE INSIDER, THE MATRIX, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES, ARLINGTON ROAD, MAN ON THE MOON, CRUEL INTENTIONS, GO, FIGHT CLUB... But the one that is most likely to stay as a classic is AMERICAN BEAUTY. Even not being the year's best (MAGNOLIA is even better), it won 5 Oscar. And it touched us and made us laugh with an original and dark satire of the stupid and unbearable American way of life. AMERICAN BEAUTY was a semi-commercial, semi-artistic picture, or maybe not one nor the other, that used symbolism and mise-en-scene to tell its story and criticize the American family, also talking about the beauty that we can see even in a plastic bag. If that criticism was deep and bittersweet, the one that is in SOUTH PARK- BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT is very different. Not just the American society is criticized, but also the militarism, the racism, the movie ratings, the patriotism, Brooke Shields, Saddam Hussein, the Baldwin brothers, Winona Ryder... Everything and everyone you imagine... And much more.I started watching the animated series some years ago, but I was never a die-hard fan. But when I watched it I had a great time. When the movie was released in the US I was looking forward to see it, but the Brazilian distributors committed a mistake and the movie was released here only in August 2000. But the wait was worthy. SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT is the most offensive movie I've ever seen and also one of the funniest. I couldn't stop laughing a minute. There was more and more and more absurds and wicked situations to laugh at. But the good thing is that all those offensive things have a point. Trey Parker and Matt Stone criticize everything, but in fact they just want to show the American hypocrisy, using all the kinds of over-the-top situations. Of course the criticism is not so mature and strong as in FIGHT CLUB, but Parker and Stone just want to make us have fun with that, while David Fincher has a very different point- with no links to make audiences have fun. The story starts when the four boys go to the movies to watch a R-rated movie starring Terrance and Philip, two Canadian comedians who use the sickest kind of humor. The boys start to use the words they heard on the movie and after some days all the school is using the words. Of course the mothers get very, very angry, so what they can do... Blame Canada, why not? They start a real war against the country 'above', but the things get really nasty, involving even the Devil and Saddam Hussein as lovers. You can't even imagine what happens then... Kenny's death in the hospital room is one of the funniest parts, but this is a minor thing (there is the 'search for the clitoris', a certain German porn video in the Internet and more). Of course everything is taken to the limit, but all is covered by an intelligent screenplay and much originality.The idea of using a musical structure is another smart thing. The Disney animations are musicals, but some of them (POCAHONTAS, yawn!) are so pathetic that they may harm children's minds. SOUTH PARK is not for children- don't even think that! The point is that the songs are more realistic and intelligent, even using an interminable number of F-words. (That song about the uncle is so sick!)SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT may be really hazardous, even fatal to the most delicate and conventional people, but if you are an open person and like to laugh of absurds, then this movie is for you. The funniest film of 1999 by far and one of the funniest ever made. But don't forget there is a point, that makes it... bittersweet.",9,0,0,30 September 2000
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," A pleasant romantic comedy, very funny... but don't expect much!

Chicken Run," Not just a chick flick
","CHICKEN RUN (2000) ***Â½ Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park. Voices: Julia Sawalha, Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson, Jane Horrocks.The first image you have shows a... Well, it looks like a concentration camp in the Auschwitz style. Many identical small houses, huge wire fences, and it's dark, very dark. But then you see... Well, a chicken trying to escape from the place... but she fails. These failed tries of escaping are shown several times in the hilarious first minutes of CHICKEN RUN, the new stop-motion animation by Peter Lord and Nick Park, the creators of the awarded and worldwide famous cartoons of WALLACE & GROMIT. The unlucky chicken who always ends up in the solitaire (I mean, garbage) is Ginger. And the concentration camp is an English farm in the '50s, owned by Mrs. Tweedy, a mean and ambitious women who mistreats her husband and only thinks about making money with the chicken. Ginger wants to escape at all costs, but there's no way... till heaven sends her the solution: Rocky, a flying rooster from the US who will teach them how to fly. Of course things won't be all right, especially after Mrs. Tweedy buys a new machine for making chicken pies.Wonderfully written, CHICKEN RUN's greatest virtue is its clever concept. It borrows many elements from real life and action flicks in general and puts it into the chickens' day-by-day life. It works in many levels as a family movie (children are loving it!) but also pleases teenagers and adults- we can have fun with the references to prison/escape and action movies in general. But don't make confusion- this isn't only a satire and the references aren't so obvious as in Mel Brooks' and Leslie Nielsen's parodies. The links are mostly slight, as the farm/concentration camp/repressed chicken/prisoner link I've already mentioned and, for example, a small spoof of the AIR FORCE ONE scene, in which Harrison Ford flies outside a helicopter holding a wire or something close to that.The stop-motion technic deserves much credit. The WALLACE & GROMIT cartoons were short-feature films, while CHICKEN RUN is an 80 minutes long-feature film. It's not suffice to say that the work was hard- each tiny movement was filmed separately, and then edited- but it was worthy. It's one of those things that you can only see on the big screen of a theater.The characters are all well defined: Ginger and Rocky are the heroes, Mrs. Tweedy is the villain and Mr. Tweedy is her poor husband, convinced by her that he has hallucinations with the chickens. Rocky has the most famous of the voices: Hollywood star Mel Gibson. Ginger is dubbed by Julia Sawalha and Mrs. Tweedy has the voice of Miranda Richardson.There are plenty of memorable characters (the two mice, the dumb chicken, the RAF rooster) and delightful scenes (Ginger and Rocky inside the pie machine, the climax) in CHICKEN RUN, that will make this a small classic of animation. Even if we know what is going to happen in the end, we have great fun during the whole film. This colorful story about quest for freedom and liberty is for sure one of the best, funniest, most intelligent and most invigorating animation movies to be released in the past years.",7,0,0,18 February 2001
X-Men," What a pleasant surprise!
","WARNING: SOME SPOILERS AHEADI had a strange curiosity in watching 'X-Men' because of the fine reviews it was receiving. But I had many doubts about it. 1) I have never, I mean NEVER read an 'X-Men' comic book. I had already watched some episodes of the cartoon, but didn't understand a word of it. Maybe the words would sound to me like Chinese. But, man, I was wrong! 2) If you watched 'Judge Dredd', 'Batman Forever', 'Batman & Robin', 'Superman 2, 3, 4...' or 90% of comic books adaptations, you know what it means- crap, brainless, Razzie Awards... I was afraid that 'X-Men' joined the list. But, man, I was wrong! 3) I do not appreciate summer blockbusters very much. There are exceptions of course ('Gladiator'), but the majority is pure crap. 'The Mummy' is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I had an unpleasant experience in the movies last week watching the infamous 'Gone in 60 Seconds'. 'X-Men' could have joined the list very well and would be a perfect meal for the Razzie Awards. But, man, I WAS WRONG!In fact, 'X-Men' is one of the best blockbusters I've seen in a very long while. It's very far from a perfect movie, but it has everything you need for your perfect summer flick: thrilling action, terrific special effects, cool characters, good soundtrack, amazing scenery. And for my taste, an above the average character development.This could have been just another action flick, or something worse. But the difference is a good screenplay (a rarity on the genre) and a decent director, who (thanks God) didn't know anything about the X-Men. The man is Bryan Singer, who had already directed two other films: the great 'The Usual Suspects' and the mediocre 'Apt Pupil'. He teaches us everything (or almost that) we, outsiders, should know about the X-Men. The film starts in a Nazi field on the World War II, showing Magneto when he was a child, starting to use his powers and, maybe because of that, separated from the rest of the jews. Now, in the near future, there is a weird segregation in the society: the homo sapiens (us, of course) and the homo superiors. These are mutants who have to learn how to use their power, and they really suffer with that. They are divided in two groups: the ones led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart)- the X-Men, who wish that the society accepts them, and the ones led by Magneto (Ian McKellen), who want to start a war against the homo sapiens. These two characters were compared by Singer with Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. The X-Men are Dr. Jean Grey, Cyclops, Storm, among others. They are receiving two newcomers- Rogue, a girl who kills people who touch her, and Wolverine, a very strong man with bad mood and those metal knives inside his hands. Magneto's men are Sabertooth, Mystique and Toad, all of them really nasty. I understood well what all the characters represent, and I thought this was a great job by the screenwriter.I got even what I didn't expect- some depth. Wolverine is the most well-developed character, but we will know more about him on the sequel. Magneto is a very interesting character, ambiguous and not just plain bad. I really liked the way the movie treated the good and the evil, but I still wanted to know a little more about the rivality between Magneto and Xavier, about Storm, Jean Grey and Cyclops. I think everything will be more explained in the sequel. This movie lets the door wide open for the sequel: what is the secret of Wolverine's past? What will happen now that Mystique has turned into the Senator? What will be Magneto's plans now? What will happen to Rogue? Let's wait for the sequel- and I hope they make a good sequel, as good as the original.Overall, 'X-Men' was a very pleasant surprise in many ways. It is a good choice if you are tired to see things as 'Gone in 60 Seconds'. And it destroys the myth that every comic book adaptation is awful. Along with the first 'Batman', it is there the prove the opposite.I thought they put $75 million dollars in the right place. 'Gone in 60 Seconds' costed $90 million, 'The Patriot' costed $110 million, but 'X-Men' is much better. It's fun, stylish, smart, amazing. Not perfect, but very good.8 out of 10 = EASILY RECOMMENDED",6,0,0,13 August 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Burton's great comeback
","Tim Burton is not my favorite director, but is certainly one of I most admire. His dark style, present in a great part of his films, is just amazing and magical. Talking about magic, he is able to pass it to the audience in each of his films. In 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns', he adapted very well the story of the man of shadows in Gotham City, what didn't happen in the two Joel Schumacher films. 'Edward Scissorhands' is one of the most magical and sweet films of the '90s. In 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', Burton did an inventive and weird animated movie. In 'Ed Wood', maybe his best film to date, he could do a biographical story at the same time controversial and hilarious. And 'Mars Attacks'... Well... It's his weakest film, but still that rather enjoyable. To repair this small mistake, he wonderfully adapted an old American tale- 'Sleepy Hollow'- and did his great comeback.'Sleepy Hollow' tells the story of Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a New York detective who believes only in what he sees. He goes to a small village in order to investigate some strange decapitation murders. The inhabitants claim that they were commited by a weird creature who is part of the folk of the place- the 'headless horseman'. Crane, of course, doesn't believe in anything at first, but a childhood trauma and a romance can help him with his mission. I won't tell more things about the plot, because I don't want to spoil your surprises, and so that the film gets more enjoyable and intriguing to watch.It is difficult to say if 'Sleepy Hollow' is Tim Burton's best. It doesn't have the sweetness of 'Edward Scissorhands', or the ingenuity of 'Ed Wood', but it is a very special film. It is original, dark, with a strange black humor and sometimes scary. If I had to define the genre of this movie, it would be fantasy. More than comedy, horror, mystery. Because, in the deep, it is beautiful- and don't forget there is a romance! The acting is fabulous, specially Depp and Christina Ricci- one of the greatest promises of Hollywood for the future. Its dark, wonderful cinematography is definetely Oscar-worthy, and so are the costumes, the art direction, the special effects and the make-up effects.'Sleepy Hollow' can be not of the 10 year's best, but it is one of the most enjoyable, exciting and entertaining films of last year.So prepare for some scares, much fun and a great twist in the end.

Notting Hill," Very funny comedy about serious subjects
","'Notting Hill' is one of the 10 year's best in my opinion. It is a very intelligent romantic comedy about some matters of life.Julia Roberts (great and wonderful) plays Anna Scott, the most famous film star in the world, who is in England to promote her new film. Hugh Grant is William Thacker, an ordinary man, who owns a book shop in Notting Hill, London, and is not very lucky with love. One day Anna comes into William's shop and... Well, it seems to be one more romantic comedy, and just that. But it is not. As in 'As Good as it Gets' the director uses humor to discuss some serious subjects. Here each character has his/her own problem and his/her own joy.1-Anna Scott: she's the most famous woman in the world and seems to be happy. But as she says 'this thing of fame is not real'. She needs something more...2-William Thacker: he doesn't have much money and is not lucky with women, although he's handsome and a nice person. He also needs something more.3-Will's friend and his wife (on the wheelchair): they seem to be happy and, even with some problems, they try to live their life like everybody else.4-Will's sister and his roommate: he is silly and unusual; she is quite strange and also unusual. Also need something else.Well, we can see that even a comedy can be a complex film. In short, 'Notting Hill' is a film about the celebrity life, but we have to pay attention at the supporting roles.Julia Roberts shows that she can be a great actress if she wants to. She also proved this in 'Stepmom'. Hugh Grant doesn't surprise me; we've already known he is a good actor. The writers and the producers are the same of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and here, once more, they show the value of their work.It is impossible not to love 'Notting Hill'!",8,0,0,11 September 1999
American Psycho," Sick, bitter, sarcastic, weird, brilliant- one of the best and most underrated films of 2000
","AMERICAN PSYCHO (2000) ***1/2 Directed by Mary Harron. Starring: Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny, Cara Seymour, Samantha Mathis, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon.While writing Christian Bale's name above, I almost confused myself and wrote Patrick Bateman, the name of his character in AMERICAN PSYCHO. This is the kind of reaction that Bale, once the boy in the tragic EMPIRE OF THE SUN, causes in the audience- he fits perfectly Patrick Bateman, the Wall Street yuppie who starts killing people at night for no apparent reason. A pity that Mary Harron's film, based on Breat Easton Ellis' polemic and successful book, was so overlooked and underrated. It became known for the wrong reason: a scene of menage-a-trois that had to be cut in order to avoid the NC-17 rating (BTW, the scene wasn't cut here in Brazil!!!!!!) and the extreme violence. Some people called AMERICAN PSYCHO a pointless satire, or a satire about nothing. They aren't totally wrong: it is about the 'sweet nothing' of the '80s, the age of yuppies, who had much money and not much else.Mary Harron prints a weird style into AMERICAN PSYCHO, a kind of cross between David Lynch, David Fincher and herself- what can be seen in I SHOT ANDY WARHOL, her very interesting film debut. I haven't read Breat Easton Ellis' book, but I guess Mary, as a director and a screenwriter, did a good job, avoiding the extreme violence, but showing it stylized. The characters have a great development and the situations keep our attention from start to finish. It's awesome when Patrick talks about music before killing his next victim, when he and his friends compare his cards and all his observations about that stupid age and how he tried to escape from that, even being part of it. His lines are sarcastic, ironic.Patrick Bateman is not the usual main character of a film, so it would be difficult to play him. But Christian Bale perfectly shows how ambiguous and hard to understand Patrick is. We hate him and love him at the same time. I loved his performance! The supporting actors are also great, even in small roles. Willem Dafoe is detective Donald Kimball, who has some strange dialogues with Patrick. Chloe Sevigny is great as his secretary Jean, maybe the only innocent person in a nest of snakes. Cara Seymour is Christie, a melancholic prostitute who keeps going to his flat- I voted for her on the IMDb poll which asked: 'From the movies of 2000 I felt most sorry for...'. BTW, she is in my favorite scene, the weirdest of the whole film, right after the second menage-a-trois scene (the 'yuppie' written on the wall, the bodies, so cool!), mixing very black humor and tension. Jared Leto is Paul Allen, the first victim we see being killed. Samantha Mathis is Courtney, Bateman's drug addict lover. And Reese Witherspoon is Evelyn Williams, Bateman's annoying fiancé- I wanted more of her.On its last third, AMERICAN PSYCHO shows the truth beyond it, resulting in an ambiguous, thought-provoking finale, which stays with us for many days. It proves that AMERICAN PSYCHO is a delightful film to watch, but not in a good way. It's a wicked, sick, bitter, sarcastic, weird, brilliant satire, a triumph of black humor, with many memorable moments. It's an admirable, audacious portrait of the yuppie age, taking the love and the hate to that era to the last consequences. Expect surprises like in a sort of magic show. Love it or hate it, you won't leave the movies indifferent. And someday they wanted to put Leonardo DiCaprio as Patrick Bateman...I saw the menage-a-trois scene in the movies, you didn't...!!!",8,1,2,11 March 2001
The Shining," Disturbing and impressing
","Stanley Kubrick's films are always impressing. Since '2001' to 'Eyes Wide Shut'. We've missed the best director ever this year and nothing is going to be the same without him. During all his career, he had made many masterpieces, and never a bad film. The only time he tried to do a horror movie he had great results: 'The Shining' is there to prove.I just had the chance to see it some days ago, and I have to say that it really impressed me, specially because of the intense psychological horror.There are not many subtle scares. As I said, what really impress is the psychological factor. Still that, there are some unforgettable horror scenes: the blood gushing from the elevator, the dead body emerging of the bathtub...If you are fan of this genre (horror) this is a must-see. You can love or hate it, but it will really disturb you.",9,0,0,6 November 1999
American Beauty," Words are not enough to describe the beauty of 'American Beauty'
","As I've already said in many of my comments, the year of 1999 was really great for the movie history. We had the opportunity to see Stanley Kubrick's 'grand finale' ('Eyes Wide Shut'), an intelligent, surprising and twisted supernatural drama ('The Sixth Sense'), one of the most inventive comedies of the '90s ('Dogma'), a hilarious satire about ambitions ('Election'), a fast and exotic comedy about the 'generation X' ('Go'), the most enjoyable romantic comedy of the decade ('Notting Hill') and even a wicked and fun teen flick ('Cruel Intentions'). There were other great films last year, including some that were not released in Brazil yet (as 'Being John Malkovich' and 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'). But there was a certain movie, with a U$15 million budget, which stayed not only as the best of '99, but also the best of the '90s. Its name is simple and beautiful: 'American Beauty'.I started admiring it some months ago, when it was released in the USA and the IMDb users elected it as the second best film of all times. At first, I thought that was quite weird: will a small film be better than true masterpieces as '2001: A Space Odyssey' or 'Psycho'? This may be a little difficult to say, but the answer came last night, when I saw the sneak preview at a local movies. And the answer for that question above is:... Well, wait for my conclusion.First of all, 'American Beauty' is a satire. A satire about the society of the '90s, about the family, specially the American. What seems to be a happy family is nothing but facade. What seems to be a happy marriage is nothing but convenience. Everything is kilometres away from a perfect existence. But some facts will change the lives of these 'ordinary people'. The way as director Sam Mendes and writer Allan Ball turn all this into a dark comedy (a dramatic-dark-comedy, in fact) is really amazing. They're both geniuses, specially Mendes, on his direction debut. And pay attention at this: the movie can be resumed in a simple, ordinary phrase- 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. Mendes and Ball care for each character, and each of them has a great importance in the whole film.Kevin Spacey wonderfully plays Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man who lives his life without being cared for none, including his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) and his annoying wife Carolyn (Annette Bening). But one day he meets Jane's friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), and starts to be obssesed by her. While that happens, Carolyn gets involved with Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) and Jane falls in love for the 'psycho next door', Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), whose parents (Chris Cooper and Allison Janney) are an army coronel and an 'alive statue'. Spacey gives his best performance since 'The Usual Suspects', and I see another Oscar on his shelf. Bening is in a wonderful, also Oscar worthy acting. The rest of the cast is worthy of as much recognition as the main couple, specially Bentley, Birch and Suvari, as the nowadays' 'lolita'.Everything in 'American Beauty' is perfect, from the soundtrack to the brilliant film editing. It has many memorable scenes, quotes, and wonderful images. It's difficult to say that it is the best film ever made if we take a look at Kubrick's and Hitchcock's films. But skip for the last line of the comment if you want to.I could say many other things about such a complex film, but the IMDb wouldn't accept my comment for being so long. So make your Oscar bets, because this is surely best picture. I give you my hands...My conclusion: 'American Beauty' is cynic, wicked, funny, entertaining, disturbing, powerful, warm, brilliant, emotional, superb, wonderful -- The best film of 1999 -- The best film of the '90s -- And, in my mind, at least for some time... The best film ever made (!)",10,0,0,5 February 2000
Being John Malkovich," Creativity at its highest level
","A genius! A genius! A genius! This is what Spike Jonze is. His nomination for this year's Oscar as best director is more than deserved, and I can't understand why this amazing film that is 'Being John Malkovich' wasn't nominated for best picture. Well, maybe that's because the Academy is too old-fashioned but, if they were, they wouldn't nominate 'American Beauty', last year's best. In fact, 'Being John Malkovich' is 99's second best, being only after 'American Beauty' on my top 10 (note that I haven't seen 'Magnolia' because it wasn't released in Brazil yet). So... let's talk about the movie!Have you ever wanted to be someone else? What about a famous person? What about John Malkovich, even if it lasts only 15 minutes?People can say everything they want about 'Being John Malkovich', but conventional is the last thing it is. The story, about a puppeteer named Craig (John Cusack), who founds by chance in his office a portal to John Malkovich's head, has a wonderful surrealism. The screenplay is a explosion of originality, mixing delightful absurd elements with very, very funny comedy and some drama.The film starts showing Craig's life with his weird wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz- you won't recognize her), who lives with an ape named Elijah (which has a childhood trauma), a dog, lots of birds, an iguana and other animals. He is a puppeteer and has no job. One day he finds one at the 7.5 (!) floor of a building, where he meets some strange people, as his boss, Dr. Lester (a 105 year old man), and a secretary named Floris, who makes confusion with words. His work colleague is the cold Maxine (Catherine Keener), for whom he falls in love. After he finds that portal to Malkovich's head, his life totally changes- for better or worse. Some weird and hilarious things will happen, including lesbian love and a menage-a-trois with two people. But everything gets more complicated when John Malkovich enters his own head (the most hilarious scene), and when Craig starts to control Malkovich as if he were one of his dolls. That's when the film starts to show its dramatic side. But it doesn't mean that 'Malkovich' is irregular. Yes, it has a hilarious first one hour or some more and the last forty minutes are more serious if you look by a side. However, drama, comedy and fantasy are mixed very well, not resulting in a film full of gaps and skips as 'Edtv'.Under a surreal story, writer Charlie Kaufman hides important messages and morals. All the characters are very well developed and the cast is just fantastic. John Cusack, Cameron Diaz and John Malkovich should have been nominated to the Oscar, but the great Catherine Keener was the only lucky one.So watch 'Being John Malkovich'. It's the only thing I can say. It's weird, wild, funny, twisted, surprising, unusual and totally unpredictable. You shouldn't miss this one anyway.(A perfect) 10/10!Spike Jonze is a genius!",10,0,0,8 March 2000
Man on the Moon," Carrey makes this great film even better
","Rating: ***1/2 out of ****'Man on the Moon' opened in Brazil two weeks ago, together with two other films: 'Down to You' and 'Hanging Up'. It was released in the biggest number of screens, received the best reviews, but it seems that the audience didn't like it very much. Well, Andy Kaufman is almost unknown here (I confess I had never heard about him before reading about the film). Only the people who watch 'Taxi' on Sony Entertainment Television may know him. But I'm sure that about 60% of the people who went to the movies to watch 'Man on the Moon' left disappointed because they were expecting a slapstick comedy- the last thing it is. In the audience I attended to, there was a group of stupid teen girls (whose favorite film is probably 'She's All That') who didn't seem to get the point of the amazing, hilarious beginning. At the end, I heard one of them complaining: 'This is the worst movie I've ever seen.' And another one said a kind of nonsense thing: 'This is even worse than 'Sleepy Hollow'!'  another great film, I have to say. So I got very angry and thought: 1- They don't know that this is a biography about a REAL person. 2- They've never heard about a genius named Milos Forman; 'Amadeus', 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' mean nothing for them. 3- They were expecting 'Dumb and Dumber- Part 2' or 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective- Part 3'. 4- I'm sure they also didn't like 'The Truman Show'. 5- They are futile, disposable people who should be ignored (I'm sure they would make annoying jokes about the frog rain in 'Magnolia', like 'Duh! Senseless!').'Man on the Moon' is another great creation of Milos Forman. He has been criticized for making an empty film, without telling details about Andy Kaufman's life, showing only his shows, his polemics. But that's how biographies should be. Who cares if Andy lost his puppy dog hit by a car when he was a child? Who cares if his parents used to fight? Who cares if he had problems at school? What is important in the life of a person, more specifically an artist, is how he/she became famous, how he/she faced it etc. And 'Man on the Moon' shows it perfectly well. Milos Forman had already done masterpieces as 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', 'Amadeus' (another unusual biography) and, in my opinion, 'Valmont'. 'The People vs. Larry Flynt' was also a different kind of biography and was almost perfect. That's what happens in 'Man on the Moon'- it is almost a masterpiece. As in Carrey's previous picture, 'The Truman Show', there is a small, almost imperceptible thing missing. Here I guess it's the presence of Courtney Love's character in Kaufman's life. She could have been quite more significant here.But this small flaw can be left by the side in the middle of so many qualities: an amazing director, a great screenplay (with hilarious moments and some emotional ones) and, above everything, Jim Carrey. It was just prejudice, I think, his snub at the Oscar. This was the Oscar of snubs: 'Magnolia', Paul Thomas Anderson, 'Eyes Wide Shut', Stanley Kubrick, 'Being John Malkovich', Cameron Diaz, Reese Witherspoon and there it goes. But the Academy should have forgotten Carrey's mistakes of the past (hey! Hilary Swank was in 'The Next Karate Kid'!). I guess it's the best performance of his career- by far. God! I don't know almost anything about Andy Kaufman, but Carrey resurrects him. Personification, whatever! HE IS ANDY KAUFMAN!'Man on the Moon' is a must-see- specially if you like Forman's style of film-making. There are many memorable scenes: the beginning, the concert in Carnegie Hall, the funeral and the ambiguous ending- ambiguous in a good way. It's superbly directed, acted and written. Even if it can't be between Forman's masterpieces, it is something worthy of much recognition.",8,0,0,18 May 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," How many words for beautiful can you use?
","CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (2000) **** Directed by Ang Lee. Starring: Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, Chang Chen, Cheng Pei-pei.I don't have reason to hide that I was worried about what I would think of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. I was never a fan of martial-arts movies. The story, the characters and the situations are laughable and, even recognizing that Bruce Lee was a great personality, I just don't care about his movies. It never occurred to me that I could watch a Jackie Chan flick some day, but I thought the fight sequences in THE MATRIX and CHARLIE'S ANGELS were very cool. I wasn't a big fan of Ang Lee's pictures either. THE WEDDING BANQUET and EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN were fine, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was lovely, but THE ICE STORM was quite disappointing for me and I didn't watch RIDE WITH THE DEVIL because it didn't interest me to see a Civil War art-house starring Tobey Maguire and Jewel. However, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON received some of the best reviews of the year worldwide, won 2 Golden Globes in January and is nominated to 10 Oscar, including best picture, best director and best film in a foreign language. That changed my view and I started to wait anxiously for it. I saw it yesterday and... Wow! Wow! Wow!The story told in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON brings nothing new, but what makes the difference is the way it is told. Ang Lee returns to his roots and pays homage to the old Chinese 'Wuxia' movies, with the story of two women who try to find their place in the 19th century China. Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) is a brave woman and an excellent fighter, who never confessed her love to fellow friend Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat). He has just come back from his long training and now he wants to rest for some reason. He asks Shu Lien to give his sword, 'Green Destiny', to an old man as a gift. For that, she makes a long journey to his house, where she meets Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi), a young woman, daughter of an aristocrat, who is just about to marry a man she doesn't love. At night, a masked thief steals the sword and that act is what will make all the characters evaluate their strength and their inside feelings.If Ang Lee doesn't win the best director award, I'll be very very angry. First of all, he has made one of the most visually gorgeous and rich films of the last years and maybe of all times. He literally takes us to another world, where you have to leave logic at the door. During two hours, you become so involved in what's happening on the screen that you forget what time of the day it is. If I were him, I would never stop working with the same cinematographer, writer, composer, set decorator, costume designer, editor and cast. The cinematography is triumphant: the colors are rich but never exaggerated, the light and the dark are always on the right place. The music is just wonderful. I loved it! The sets are terrific and so are the costumes, and the editing helps to make the fight sequences even better than they are (we'll get to them in a minute). This is the kind of film made to fit perfectly the big screen. It's really beautiful, wonderful, marvelous, gorgeous! Probably the most well made film of the year. All that with a 15 million dollar budget!!!!!It's not every film, especially a martial-arts one, that has such a complex character development. We can identify with all their dramas and choices, especially Jen Yu, a young woman who wants to run away from conventions and stay with her beloved Lo, but first of all she has to choose what side she should stay: with Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, who will take her to a training, or with Jade Fox, a mean woman who has killed Li Mu Bai's master and is target of other people's revenge, but has been Jen's master, even if she doesn't know the real meaning of the manual, a thing that Jen is able to understand. In fact, she is her own master and also an amazingly determined person. The relationship between Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai is also very well portrayed and even the supporting characters, as a detective who seeks for revenge against Jade Fox, have their place. This story has wonderful messages about courage, determination, destiny, love and strength. `Crouching tiger, hidden dragon' is a Chinese proverb about hiding your forces, what all the characters do. The screenplay explores many situations and there's even place for some slight humor. By the way, there isn't an isolated genre the film is part of: adventure, romance, fantasy, drama, action, there's all.CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON didn't receive any Oscar nominations for acting, but it is top notch. The Mandarin language sounds like poetry when said by Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun-Fat and Zhang Ziyi. Believe me, it's never hard to follow- it's delightful. Michelle gives us a quiet, powerful performance as Shu Lien. Chow Yun-Fat proves once again that he is excellent, as Li Mu Bai. But Zhang Ziyi is the best- she is very pretty and acts with security and strength, just like a veteran.Now we finally get to the already famous fight sequences that break the law of gravity. I confess that I found it to be very strange the first time I heard about, but in the film it is breath-taking. If there's someone in your session who laughs when the characters fight kung-fu in the air, just ignore this person because he/she doesn't know what is cinema. The same way there are films that portray life just like it is, as Robert Altman's masterpiece NASHVILLE, there are fantasy films where logic is left at the door. It's more than impressive, it's jaw-dropping when you see what they could do using only wires. The two women running on the roof, Jen and Li Mu Bai walking on the water and especially the same two fighting on the bamboo forest- the most beautiful and memorable scene of 2000. I absolutely adored them!CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON will stay as Ang Lee's masterpiece. I think I couldn't describe how wonderful it is, but if you have seen it you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, don't think twice: leave the logic at the door and see it on the big screen. Don't worry if it doesn't win many Oscar. GLADIATOR will win best picture, but CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON is much better. It will recover many people's faith in the art of cinema. And prepare yourself for one of the most poetic endings you will have seen.",9,0,0,4 March 2001
Amadeus," A very unusual biographical film; disturbing and at the same time deep
","Biographical films are all just the same. They start showing the childhood of the person portrayed, after that how he/she started to make success or to have prominence, then his/her marriage, the children and finally the very sad death- if it doesn't show the person dying, it shows some subtitles saying what happened. Of course there are some exceptions, as 'Hilary and Jackie' (that is great, even following this formula) and this masterpiece, 'Amadeus', that tells by flashback the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Milos Forman is a great director, and also proved that with 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', 'Valmont' and 'The People vs. Larry Flynt' (also a biography). Instead of showing a light, sweet, depressing story, he decided to make a disturbing film, with some suspense and wonderful visually.Antonio Salieri is a musician who is not very recognized and for that he envies Mozart, showed as a very weird man, but also with a very recognized talent. Salieri can't stand this situation and he will do anything to get this over. With this simple storyline, the film tells a important story, about envy and ambition, both present in our world. Forman's aim was just to focus on this situation. So, yes, he may have committed some historycal mistakes, but it doesn't matter. With a great screenplay, great cast, wonderful costumes, music and scenery, he did a superb film, winning 9 worthy Oscars.'Amadeus' is a must-see, even if you don't like classical music.",9,3,5,20 February 2000
The Game," A game you must play
","Very few films have the power to manipulate the audience till the end as 'The Game'. It is one of the most inventive, unusual, weird and unpredictable films of the '90s. I just can't understand why it wasn't nominated as best original screenplay on the Oscar, because you don't see films like this one every day.Once upon a time, there was a millionaire named Nicholas Van Orton. He had everything he wanted, except the company of people- friends, girlfriends, etc. On his 48th birthday, he met his brother in a restaurant and he was given a small gift- a free pass for the CRS. But what was the CRS- The Consumer Recreation Service? Well... He had never heard about it, so he decided to use his pass. After doing many exams in the CRS, some strange things started to happen. Everything started with a wooden clown in his garden, which had a key into its mouth. Then his television started to 'talk' to him. And after that he met a waitress named Christine in the most unusual situations. From this moment on, his life was never the same...You can't, you just can't find out what comes next in 'The Game'. It kept my attention each second. While it is coming to the end, we think that we know everything, but we don't. The ending was just... Wow! Amazing! I could have never found out that. It was a huge twist, as I just saw in 'The Sixth Sense'. Some people may not be convinced by the final twist, but I didn't mind. After the film ended, I was just blown away. I couldn't think about another thing. It is not THE perfect movie, because there are some scenes that could have been deleted. But I gave it a 9 and I can't give it less than that. Even Michael Douglas surprised me with a very solid acting. And Deborah Kara Unger is just amazing in a great performance.As I've already said, I don't know why 'The Game' was not nominated in any category on the Oscar. It really impressed me. Everyone who praised this film was right. David Fincher proved once more that he is a genius. Everything I can say is: play this game...",8,0,1,22 December 1999
Meet Joe Black," Very good film, but did they really need three hours?
","'Meet Joe Black'... Well... What can I say about it? A beautiful movie, a wonderful story, good acting, good direction... This could have been an excellent film, but there is a problem- it is too long, and without a reason. I liked the film and I really recommend it, but two hours were good enough for this one. Fortunately, there are many good things on 'MJB' and it didn't happen the same thing of 'The Horse Whisperer' (three hours, bad story, bad acting, tedious). The story is about the millionaire William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), who is about to die. The Death, or Joe Black (Brad Pitt), makes a proposition for William - if he shows Joe the life in Earth, he will not die soon. However, Joe falls in love with Susan Parrish (Claire Forlani), William's daughter, and then everything takes another way. It looks like a little strange and nonsense, but it's not. It is a beautiful film that, even with some defects, is a worth-seeing.",4,0,0,23 November 1999
The Insider," A high level drama
","I didn't know what to expect of 'The Insider'. The first time I heard about it I didn't care much. Then, I saw one scene at a TV programme and I thought it was a conventional film as 'A Civil Action'. But, in December, it received some nominations to the Golden Globe, including best picture and, even not winning anyone, I started to show some interest about it. About fifteen days ago, the nominees for the Oscar were announced and I knew that 'The Insider' could be a strong rival for 'American Beauty' -my new favorite film-, so it had to be almost as good as the other one. Well... I watched it this afternoon, and... if it's not better than 'American Beauty', or as good as that, it is a high level film which has its importance.Everything in 'The Insider' has a high level, from the acting to the screenplay. Director Michael Mann, whose previous works were 'The Last of the Mohicans' and 'Heat', does a wonderful job with the camera and is helped by a very well written screenplay, based on a true story, which makes suspense about ordinary things and keeps the attention of the audience. If Kevin Spacey weren't on the list for best actor nominees, my favorite one would be Russell Crowe. He was great in 'LA Confidential' and here he perfectly plays a man in contradiction, who has to make an important decision and has to deal with the consequences. Al Pacino delivers a stellar performance once more, and Christopher Plummer should have been remembered by the Academy. The film has its flaws (the fact that it is slow, for instance), but this defects are covered by its great qualities.'The Insider' is a very important movie for some reasons. It is about the power of the media in the '90s and how it can manipulate people. But, more than anything, it is a film about ethics, and how ordinary people deal with it. Russell Crowe's character, Jeffrey Wigand, is on a very difficult situation, and the film shows very well how he faces it. That's one of the greatest points of this picture.I gave 'The Insider' a 9 out of 10 for all its qualities and great points, showing a sad true story very, very well. But if you want PERFECTION, pure perfection, go watch 'American Beauty', which is for sure my favorite for best picture.",8,0,0,27 February 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," Much more than a ''Cuckoo's Nest' rip-off'
","Rating: ***1/2 out of ****Sometimes movie critics are very mean with some films, just because of a single detail. That's what happened to 'Cruel Intentions' (it was said to be a stupid, offensive version of 'Les Liaison Dangereuses'), 'Stigmata' (not a masterpiece, but misunderstood) and 'Girl, Interrupted'. This movie received some not very exciting reviews, mostly because critics argued that it was a 'rip-off 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest''. But I think they were at least VERY unfair. The only similarity I can see is that both are placed at a mental institution, where a normal, not crazy person is sent for some reason. Only this and nothing more. While 'Cuckoo's Nest' is a deep and complex study of the human mind, 'Girl, Interrupted' talks about how difficult adolescence is, with no pretension to be an instant classic. And guess what? I totally enjoyed it.'Girl, Interrupted', directed by James Mangold, tells the (true) story of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), a young woman who tries to kill herself by drinking a bottle of vodka with a bottle of aspirin in the end of the '60s. Her parents believe that she has some mental problem, and send her to Claymoore, a mental institution where she will literally have her life changed. There she meets new and interesting people: Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg), a rather rigid nurse, Georgina (Clea DuVall), a pathological liar, Polly (Elizabeth Moss), a ingenuous girl with half of her face burned, Daisy (Brittany Murphy), a selfish girl who has a thing about chickens, among others. But one of them will be responsible for her change: Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a pretty, sexy, irresponsible sociopath who will build a relationship of mixed feelings with Susanna.The story is interesting, but would be nothing without a good screenplay. This aspect surprised me, because I thought this would be a sentimental, ingenuous film. In fact, the screenplay is almost the opposite. It is warm, human, clever, keeps the attention of the audience and- believe it or not - there is no big cliché. Well, we can predict the end, but we can't predict each scene, each quote and what will happen to each character. I really liked this detail.There are many qualities here (the soundtrack, for example, is excellent, amazing), but the biggest one is the acting. I had my doubts about Angelina Jolie's performance before watching the film. I knew she was a great actress, but did she deserve the Oscar as best supporting actress? Now that I saw the film I can say 'YES'. Even competing with Catherine Keener and Chloe Sevigny, she was quite superior. Her character is a mixture of 'mad girl' with 'sexy woman'. And Angelina plays Lisa with an amazing strength. But she doesn't own the film. We can't forget of the talented Winona Ryder, who was distant of screens for some time, since the terrible 'Alien Resurrection'. She does a great comeback.What I have to conclude is that 'Girl, Interrupted' is not a copy of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. They are two different films with slightly similar themes. 'Cuckoo's Nest' is better, of course, but 'Girl, Interrupted' has its qualities, which are not few. It's a must-see.",8,0,2,29 April 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick's second best
","You know, I've never made a top 10 list of my favorite movies ever. Maybe because I'm just 15 and I haven't seen so many classics and masterpieces yet. But I really liked the ones I saw, such as 'Psycho', 'Casablanca', 'Rear Window', 'Gone With the Wind', among others, but in special Stanley Kubrick's films. I think he is a genius since I saw 'Eyes Wide Shut' this year, so I decided to rent some other celebrated films of him. First, it was 'The Shining'. I thought it was a very scary and impressing horror movie, one of the best things ever made on the genre. After that I saw '2001: A Space Odyssey'. This one just fascinated me. If I make a top 10 list, I think '2001' will be on the top. It is the best sci-fi ever and one of the most beautiful studies about the human beings. But I can't forget 'A Clockwork Orange', that is for sure one of the most disturbing and impressing films ever made.'A Clockwork Orange' is not for everyone, first of all- as many other Kubrick's movies. It is really strong- violent, with some strong sexuality, rapes, etc. But the main reason for what I call it 'strong' is the theme. It is about a futuristic society, where the violence is everywhere and it seems to have no order. A young man, named Alex, leads a group of disorders- his 'droogs'- whose main interest is the 'ultra violence'. They drug themselves, break in houses, rape women, violent men. In addition, Alex loves Beethoven. Some day, in the middle of a house break-in, his 'droogs' betray him and he is caught by the police. He is taken to prison, but there he hears about a treatment which can cure disorders. He persuades and is persuaded to be part of the treatment. It is all very strange and shocking, but the doctors claim to have cured him. He tries to start a normal life again, but... was he really cured?Only Stanley Kubrick could have done a masterpiece like this one. Everything is perfect, from the soundtrack to the acting. It is used symbolic elements and some words that can seem very strange, but there is a vocabulary for them in the credits. They are very interesting in fact- pay attention. Kubrick cares for each detail and uses a dark humor to tell the story, that is somehow tragic in some moments- the victims' payback. Funny (darkly funny) in others- the ending. Shocking in others- see, for example, the scene where Alex sings 'Singing in the Rain' while he rapes a woman. The movie was even banned in some countries, but this is just stupid.Overall, 'A Clockwork Orange' will certainly be on my top 10 list when I make it. It is weird. It is scary. It is impressing. It is disturbing. It is unforgettable!",10,0,0,23 December 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Congratulations, Kubrick! 10/10
","I've seen 'Eyes Wide Shut' this afternoon and I thought it was incredible. OK, it is quite slow, but it is good to forget its failures and enjoy the qualities. Stanley Kubrick proves that he was one of the greatest directors of all the times, and he still is in the memory of his fans. Everything in the film is on its place, so let's start with the cast.Nicole Kidman has a terrific performance and deserves an Oscar nomination, or even win. She surprised me, because she has already done many bad films ('Practical Magic', 'Batman Forever', etc). Here she plays Alice Harford, the wife who has almost betrayed her husband. He is Tom Cruise, another one who surprised me for the same reason. He plays Dr. Bill Harford, the 'almost betrayed' husband ready to face some sexual adventures. The supporting actors and actresses were also great. Kubrick really cares about all the characters. We can see this in Sidney Pollack's acting, but there are others: the strange owner of 'Rainbow Fashions' and his daughter, the pianist Nick Nightingale, the hotel desk clerk, the people in the orgy.The scenes are just wonderful. The orgy... Oh, the orgy! Perfect, perfect, perfect! Only Kubrick could imagine those disturbing and at the same time fascinating scenes.The soundtrack is also perfect. The music can tell you a story...We can't say 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a drama, or a romance, or a mystery film. It is a film about many things: love, wedding, betrayal, sex, revenge, redemption, etc.If you're looking for sex, really strong sexuality, you'll be disappointed. The sex and the nudity in 'Eyes Wide Shut' are not on the screen all the time. Oh, right! It is also about sex, but Kubrick doesn't abuse of the sexuality.The art-set direction, the screenplay, the dialogues... Everything wonderful!So if you're looking for a real good film; not only to spend the time, but to think, this is the one. I think it'll be nominated in the main categories in the next Academy Awards. At least it really deserves.A warn: it is a very complex film, so pay attention in everything.",9,1,2,2 September 1999
Titanic," The first time I saw 'Titanic' I loved it, but the other ones...
","I've already seen 'Titanic' four times. The first time I saw it I didn't pay attention at the mistakes, so I loved it and I would give it a 9 out of 10, or even 10. The second time I began to pay more attention, specially at Leonardo DiCaprio's acting. This time I saw with my mother and she didn't like it at all. I would give it a 8. The third time I saw at school and I found more mistakes- a 7. The fourth and last (I hope so)- a 6 out of 10. I think that's my final vote.There are a lot of good things and a lot of bad things about 'Titanic'. Kate Winslet is a great actress, the art direction, the costumes, the special effects... Oh! Perfect! However, James Cameron change the actors (except Kate Winslet) into dolls. We can see this in Billy Zane's and Leonardo DiCaprio's acting. And the script is so poor... You know... Cameron was thinking he was the king of the world when he did this film. And that's the result: 'Titanic' is so-so.PS: I don't see anything special about the sound track. Well... I hate Celine Dion...",6,1,2,23 October 1999
Psycho," Check in. Relax. Take a shower...
","PSYCHO (1960)-- Grade: A+WARNING: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEADIt's amazing how some films are kind of icons not only for a decade, but forever. If you don't go to the movies just for fun, answer me: what is the first name that comes to your mind when someone talks about suspense/mystery films? FRIDAY THE 13TH? No. SCREAM? No. Wes Craven? No. John Carpenter? No. Brian De Palma? No. Of course the answer would be 'Alfred Hitchcock', if you really like cinema. Hitch is an unanimity today among film critics even more than 20 years after his death, something that never happened even with Kubrick and Buñuel, for example. Not every film of his is a masterpiece, but at least one is an unquestionable classic, an icon when you think about suspense films: PSYCHO. It was released in 1960, shocking audiences and slowly becoming a classic. Considered by the American Film Institute the 18th best film ever and being one of the most well-known pictures of the American cinema, it was obviously ripped-off lots of times, even remade by Gus Van Sant in 1998 scene by scene. But, in opposite of what we would expect, it never became stale. It's still the same PSYCHO, an unique, chilling, spectacular work of art that entertains audiences and makes them think. A masterpiece!It's amazing how this film still remains unique 40 years after its release. Every generation enjoys it, every person who watches it for the first time has a strong opinion about it, it is always a good subject for talking. Some of the most remarkable moments of the cinema are on PSYCHO, at least one: a shower scene. But first let's get back to the beginning of the story. Marion Crane works as a secretary and her boss gives her a huge amount of money to deposit. Her boyfriend has to pay some debts and they want to live together without trouble. As the smart girl she is, Marion decides to run away with the money. She knows she is doing something wrong, so she changes her car and keep going on the road. On a rainy night, she realizes that is difficult to drive more and decides to stop at a motel she doesn't know: the decadent Bates Motel ('12 cabins, 12 vacancies'). There, Marion is received by a young man named Norman Bates, the motel owner, and checks in. He invites her to come to dinner, but Marion hears the voice of Norman's mother, who refuses to let the girl enter at her house. He takes to her a small dinner on his office and they talk a little. Norman lets to know that his mother is invalid and was involved in a tragedy on the past, and he works with dead birds. He seems to be an insecure person because of his mother attitudes. They finish to talk and Marion goes to her room in order to have a shower. That seems to be a calm place, uh? Well, Marion is taking shower and... you know what happens... Poor girl! Norman gets disturbed with the fact and hides Marion's car with her body (and the money) on the swamp. Some days later, Lila Crane, Marion's sister, and Sam Loomis, Marion's boyfriend, are searching for her. A private detective, named Arborgast, will appear to help them. The secret they will find out involving the insecure boy and his mean mother is something very, very weird.With an unusual story, Hitch made the one that is the best film of his brilliant career, along with VERTIGO. The story of PSYCHO could turn into a mess, but the screenplay is perfectly written, with all the ingredients to surprise and scare us. At the screen, what we see is even better. Not one disposable scene, great situations, involving characters. And Hitch... it is not even needed to say. Helped by a wonderful cinematography and Bernard Herrman's chilling, unforgettable score, his camera takes and the angles he uses are just brilliant! The two murder scenes are just perfect, especially the one in the shower, which I don't need to say that is one of the 3 most well-known scenes of the American cinema, and also one of the 3 best, scariest etc. Oh! And the actors! Who could think that Janet Leigh would be killed on the first half? And who could think Anthony Perkins was such a mad guy? The conclusion goes to the right way, being smart and haunting.I could write all my impressions about PSYCHO, but I don't want to take this much longer. It is one of the films that most influences the American cinema of our days. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. And that's it.
To finish, I just wanted to make a parallel between a scene in PSYCHO and a similar one in Brian De Palma's DRESSED TO KILL, obviously influenced by it. When they sum up the crime in PSYCHO, the police officer say that Marion Crane was kind of an alert for the mother to show up into Norman Bates-- the rigid mother who wanted her son only for her. In DRESSED TO KILL (you may think I'm a perverted), Kate Miller and Liz Blake were alerts for the psychiatrist's male side to show up. He wanted to change his sex, but they were obstacles to him because he got 'excited' with them. I don't know why I'm writing that... That's interesting, but forget!",10,5,9,24 September 2000
The Green Mile," A very good film, but doesn't quite deserve the nomination for best picture
","Now that I've seen all the five nominees for this year's Oscar as best picture, I can say what I think of each of them-- 'American Beauty': simply the best film ever made. If you have read some of my comments, you now that (10/10)-- 'The Cider House Rules': a wonderful, warm story, beautifully acted and directed (9/10)-- 'The Insider': a very well made drama, discussing important subjects, as ethics, and showing the power of the press in our days (9/10)-- 'The Sixth Sense': an excellent supernatural drama with amazing surprises, specially in the end (10/10)-- And 'The Green Mile'... Well, it's the 'worst' in the category. I put the word worst between inverted commas because it doesn't mean that it is a bad film. Just the opposite- it's a very good one. The film begins with an old man telling to a friend of his a story by flashbacks. The story is about his life while he was a chief guard in the 'green mile' of a prison, where criminals wait to be executed. Everything changes when John Coffey, a tall black man, accused of the murder of two little girls, arrives in the prison. I won't tell many details of the plot, but some amazing, supernatural things happen, changing the lives of the guards and the prisoners.'The Green Mile' is based on a Stephen King novel, and is very well adapted by Frank Darabont, who also makes a great direction job. The acting is another high point of the film. Tom Hanks gives a good performance, and Michael Clarke Duncan surprises us. He deserves his nomination for best supporting actor, but I don't think he deserves to win.
'The Green Mile' has also its flaws. There are many impacting scenes, specially the ones where people die in the electric chair. However, the end, which could have also been impacting, is confusing and weird. Another part I didn't like was when Coffey cures Melinda, the lady with cancer. It looks like an 'Exorcist 4'. And more- that was predictable. Taking these defects, the film really works. It is not another 'Shawshank Redemption', or something better than 'American Beauty' or 'Being John Malkovich', but it is a worth seeing. And take your time to discuss some details, as the initials of Michael Clarke Duncan's character (J.C.).

Halloween," A classic!
","First of all, it is good to remember that 'Halloween' is the film which inspired all the horror flicks about serial-killers murdering young people in a small town. 'Scream', 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', 'Friday the 13th', 'Urban Legend' and others were inspired by this classic of modern horror.Nowadays, some people may not feel very scared with this film, but just imagine one thing: 'What about the people in 1978?' Well... They had already seen 'The Exorcist', but 'Halloween' was a new kind of movie for them.The story is very good, and there are all the elements to make a great horror film: it is scary, creepy, intriguing and suspenseful.A must-see for the ones who love the horror genre- like me.",8,0,0,31 October 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Brilliant! Amazing! The best thriller of the 90's!
","First of all I have to say that 'The Silence of the Lambs' is the film which inspired all the serial-killer films of the 90's (good ones like 'Se7en' and silly ones like 'Kiss the Girls'). But 'The Silence of the Lambs' has many things the other thrillers don't have.In this film we can see two of the best performances ever. Anthony Hopkins is just perfect as Hannibal Lecter, and so is Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling. The dialogues between these two characters are brilliant, and so is the whole screenplay.The film has a great story which explores deeply the main characters. It is not just a serial-killer story, but above all a deep dramatic thriller.'The Silence of the Lambs' impressed me so much that I've watched it many times.So if you hadn't watched it, take your time and see it.Surely one of the best films ever made.Rating: 10/10I heard that Ridley Scott is about to direct the sequel of 'The Silence of the Lambs', with Sarah Michelle Gellar as Clarice Starling. Well... I truly love Sarah and she's one of the greatest actresses of her generation. But we see Clarice Starling as Jodie Foster and, you know, many people will compare Sarah's acting with Jodie's.",9,2,3,9 October 1999
Any Given Sunday," Flawed yet fascinating
","Rating: *** out of ****You'll certainly agree with me that Oliver Stone is one of the most audacious and unconventional directors of our time, if not the most, now that Kubrick has gone. He has done some jaw-dropping films as 'JFK', unusual war movies as 'Platoon' and something totally weird and mad as 'Natural Born Killers'. He is not the best director of our time, but it is quite difficult to forget one of his films because of their impact. 'Any Given Sunday' is not different. It is a mad, fast, violent, strong, frenetic and crude look at the behind-the-scenes of American football.First of all, let's get clear that I have a thing about sports: I really dislike them. What to say about American football, which is almost unknown here in Brazil? However, I liked 'Any Given Sunday'. It is a movie about sports. Every scene, almost every quote, even an arguing, was somehow related to football. It would be almost unwatchable for me if not directed by such a strong director as Oliver Stone. With an amazing film editing, amazing sound, amazing acting, it is one of the most interesting films of last year, and even fascinating, in a strange way. Stone has no mercy to show blood, violent plays, even a man who has lost an eye. It's a mad, mad camera-work.However, the film has its flaws. The biggest one is the fact that it is long more than it should be. Some scenes are too long and could have been easily deleted. Another flaw is the non-existence of a real story. It's just football, arguing, violence, crude language. But, as I said, it's not an ordinary movie- and not for everyone.With incredible performances by Cameron Diaz (in a very different character of the weird Lotte Schwartz) and Al Pacino, and another great Stone direction, 'Any Given Sunday' is a worth seeing not only for football fans (did you have to be a fan of porn movies to watch 'Boogie Nights?), but also for the ones who want to see a very good movie. It is like a ball thrown on your head- in the good sense, or in the bad sense... Whatever!",5,0,0,16 April 2000
Identity," Suspenseful, chilling, original and unpredictable- one of the best films of the year so far
","It's a pity that IDENTITY was not a box-office hit. It had everything to be the next THE SIXTH SENSE, or even THE RING for that matter. Problem is: it was released right before X2 and THE MATRIX RELOADED, not having the attention it deserved.I liked it for many reasons, but the less you know about the story, the better. The film editing is great (the early scenes, for instance), the characters are engaging (which is an important factor!) and the set is moody. I loved how the story unfold, especially in the last 20 minutes- then you see how clever and original the screenwriter was.I hope it ranks better in video and DVD. All I know is that I have to see it again and catch all the clues.9/10",7,0,1,8 June 2003
X2: X-Men United," A sequel that puts the original (which was very good) on shame
","X2 is not another comic-book based action film, just as X-MEN wasn't. But, while the first film was solid, good entertainment, X2 goes further, with amazing special effects, new characters and depth on the veterans, an intriguing story... Overall, great and clever entertainment.I loved it, and can't wait for X3- and not for the sole reason of knowing the whole truth about Wolverine.9/10",8,0,0,8 June 2003
The Sixth Sense," Excellent! (10/10)
","'The Sixth Sense' is for sure one of the five best films of 1999.The story about the eight year-old boy who sees dead people impressed me very much, specially for the end- I'm going to talk about this after.Playing Cole Sear, Haley Joel Osment gives the best performance by a young actor I've ever seen, and I think he deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Bruce Willis really surprised me as Macolm Crowe, the psychologist who helps Cole. Before watching this film I hated him, but now I realize that he's not a bad actor. The only problem is that he works in very bad films, as 'Armageddon' and 'Mercury Rising'. I think he should try more experiences like this in 'The Sixth Sense'.The screenplay is just amazing. The solution for everything is just in front of you, but surely you won't find it out the first time you see it. It is one of the most impressing ends I've seen. More than 'Wild Things' and 'L.A. Confidential'.The only problem I see is that 'The Sixth Sense' was classified as a horror movie, but in fact it is a very intense drama, with some supernatural elements.I am proud that this film is still on the Top Ten list.So forget 'The Blair Witch Project' or 'The Haunting'. This is not a scary horror movie, but I'm sure you won't be disappointed anyway.No doubt it is a 10 out of 10!Warn: Pay attention in the beginning and, after the end, try to remember everything that came up to the solution.",9,0,0,22 October 1999
The Truman Show," Almost a masterpiece
","'The Truman Show' could have been one of the best films of the 90's if there wasn't a small problem: there's something missing on it. I've tried to discover what it is, but I couldn't.We are not used to see films like 'The Truman Show', so some people can think it is quite confuse, but I don't think so. Above all, it is an adult fable about a man's life. It talks about many serious and complex subjects with sweetness.The acting in the film is great. Jim Carrey redeemed himself. I don't think he deserved the Oscar, but I recognize he has a very good performance in the film. Ed Harris has the best performance of his life as Christof and he deserved the Oscar more than James Coburn, although I think Billy Bob Thornton was also superb in 'A Simple Plan'. And there is Natasha McElhone (Truman's great love in the story), and we have to pay attention at her.The screenplay is unique, but I don't know if the thing that is missing is fault of the director or the writer. Maybe it was no one's fault. I really don't know. I just think that 'The Truman Show' had everything to be a masterpiece. Well... It is almost...Rating: 9/10",8,0,0,9 October 1999
Gladiator," Thumbs up!
","Rating: ***1/2 out of ****WARNING: SOME THINGS HERE CAN BE CONSIDERED SPOILERSI like art-house films. I really do. OK, some of them are really dull and boring, but can you complain of Almodovar's and BuÃ±uel's pictures, or the Kielowski trilogy of colors? I can't. I also like very much films that stay in the middle- are not simply artistic or simply entertaining: 'Magnolia' (last year's best, by the way), 'American Beauty', '2001'. But for every 'That Obscure Object of Desire' there's a 'Gladiator'. Not that 'Gladiator' is empty (it talks about honor, courage, revenge), but its aim is to entertain audiences. So what? Let's have fun with it!As every $100+ million budget movie, 'Gladiator' is visually stunning and perfectly done and executed. The visuals are so great, vibrating and realistic that we feel we are in the ancient Rome of emperors and gladiators. After so many boring and dull films ('1492'- a joy to our eyes but empty as a hollow piece of wood- and 'G.I. Jane'- that I, personally, felt ashamed to watch), Ridley Scott comes back with all his strength. It may be a little early, but he deserves a best director nomination at next year's Oscar. The way he recreates battle scenes and fight sequences in the Coliseum is amazing, almost unbelievable. My biggest disappointment with Luc Besson's 'The Messenger' was the way he directed the battle scenes. It was the same thing of seeing a tomato being cut in slices, with Milla Jovovich yelling in the background. In 'Gladiator' it's just the opposite. There's a battle scene in Germania. Only one, but it's so real, bitter, the best since 'Saving Private Ryan'. Thumbs up for you, Mr. Scott! Resurrect the old Rome is not for everyone, nor resurrect the epic genre, which was dead since... I don't know, for a long time. Believe it or not, 'Gladiator' can be put on the same level of 'Spartacus' or 'Ben-Hur'. May the epic genre stay with us and go on like this!One of the greatest merits of 'Gladiator' (and also where its flaws are) is its screenplay. The film has 2 hours and a half, but I didn't feel it that long. I'm not against long picture (see 'Magnolia'), but entertaining films can't be boring. Well, there are slow moments in the film here and there- and that's the only visible flaw I can see. But, taking this, the screenplay is a joy. The characters have a good development, their lines are well written and the situations are emotional and intriguing. The cast just helps to keep our interest. Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, who I think would be real problems for me, give solid performances. He is Commodus, son of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), who kills the own father to get the throne. Summarizing, the villain. Phoenix is surprising and sometimes haunting. Nielsen is pretty and strong as Lucilla, Commodus' sister and object of his incestuous desire. But Russell Crowe is the big star here. He is Maximus, a general of Marcus Aurelius' troop. The emperor is old and weak, and promises him the throne. Knowing this, Commodus kills his father and orders his soldiers to kill Maximus and his family. He escapes, but his wife and son die. He becomes a slave, but starts to show his talent of fighting. He is sent to Rome as a gladiator, looking for revenge against Commodus. Everything will be solved in the final scenes, which reminded me 'Hamlet' for some reason- and will make some people cry. But let's talk about Crowe. After terrific performances in 'L.A. Confidential' and 'The Insider', he can receive his second Oscar nod with justice. He builds Maximus as a brave, strong, but also heartfelt man. Thumbs up for him too!Talking about 'thumbs-up', everything in 'Gladiator' deserves this. It's not an unforgettable masterpiece, but I won't be angry if it becomes a classic. It delivers solid entertainment and has a strong dramatic side. What else do we need?",5,1,1,26 May 2000
Contact," Another score for Jodie Foster in a wonderful film
","I am a fan of Jodie Foster since I saw 'The Silence of the Lambs', where she shows one of the best performances by an actress ever. In 'Contact' she proves one more time that she's just incredible. I can't understand why she wasn't nominated to the Oscar. Maybe because this film (that also deserved to be nominated) is very complex to the people in general- I am talking about the ones who liked 'Titanic' (yuck!), 'Good Will Hunting' (ugh!) and other dumb flicks.'Contact' was one of the best films of 1997, a weak year for cinema, and it impressed me. The story is amazing, specially the last 30 or 40 minutes, which really kept my attention. This film, as another recent one - 'The Sixth Sense' - is a thing to think about, and not just to watch and forget. Of course there are some moments when 'Contact' fails, but the mistakes are very small and the film is great the same way.",8,1,3,23 October 1999
High Fidelity," We still need the eggs
","HIGH FIDELITY (2000)  ***½Stephen Frears' romantic comedy HIGH FIDELITY is one of the few movies you should see in this crappy year of 2000, full of disasters as HANGING UP and BATTLEFIELD: EARTH. I guess it will be my favorite comedy of the year and will probably figure out on my top 10. One interesting detail is that it doesn't have deep significances and don't blow your mind, but it is certainly one of the most honest films I've ever seen.Woody Allen's superb ANNIE HALL (one of my personal favorites) served as a base for every romantic comedy that was made after it, leaving the sweet aura of the ingenuous (but delightful) films starring Marilyn Monroe, Katherine Hepburn, Doris Day, Cary Grant etc. to focus on more realistic situations (every genre was adapting to that, indeed). It is true that ludicrous and shameful situations were treated as realistic in the 80s' and 90s', but in 1989 WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... followed ANNIE HALL's steps and became critically acclaimed and a box-office hit. Now, more than a decade after WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... and 23 years after ANNIE HALL, HIGH FIDELITY is another perfect example that romantic comedies don't need to be sappy or sentimental. It is not a masterpiece as the 1977 Oscar winner and wasn't a hit as the 1989 best original screenplay nominee, but it has witty lines, great acting, some originality and much honesty, and it is very funny.Based on the acclaimed book by English author Nick Hornby, HIGH FIDELITY is set in Chicago- and not in London, as in the book. The main character is Rob Gordon (John Cusack), an ordinary man who owns a decadent vinyl shop and has just been left by his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle). He loves music, and sometimes confuses this passion with his love for women. He and his two weird employees are always making top 5 lists of everything related to music. But he decides to make his top 5 of the women who dumped him. While he suffers with his situation and his past memories, he gets involved with a singer and tries to bring Laura back to him- even though she is dating the nasty and weird Ian (Tim Robbins).There is place for many hilarious scenes- my favorite one is when Ian is talking to Rob at his shop, and he imagines what to do with the rival- and many witty lines as well. The screenplay is clever and very well written and Stephen Frears shows once again that he can do everything- from DANGEROUS LIAISONS and THE GRIFTERS to this film. The cast is full of stars in small appearances- Tim Robbins, Lily Taylor, Joan Cusack and the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones (in her best performance) are some of them. But the real star is John Cusack, who deserves an Oscar nominee for his role. He was incredible in THE GRIFTERS and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH and has his second best performance here (the best was in BULLETS OVER BROADWAY). But you have to like him and his character to truly enjoy the film, especially because Rob literally talks to the camera. To make everything better, the soundtrack is great: delightful, nostalgic and feel good.HIGH FIDELITY is a movie about relationships and (as I said) even if it doesn't have deep significances, it is worthy of discussion. With a realistic view of modern relationships between men and women, all the characters have their importance. Rob is the perfect portrait of the Gen-X guy, with his ideas, beliefs and lots of trouble. Even if the movie doesn't know when to quit in the last 20 minutes, I highly recommend it. It's not very common to watch a romantic comedy that is honest, original, hilarious, ironic, bittersweet, delightful... and romantic at the same time. And it is also something we can relate to (many times I feel like Rob).As Alvyn Singer says in ANNIE HALL, after he tells a joke about a man whose brother thinks he is a chicken: 'Well, I guess that's pretty much how I feel about relationships. You know, they're totally irrational and crazy and absurd, but I guess we keep going through it because most of us need the eggs.' Yes! We need the eggs!",8,0,1,2 December 2000
