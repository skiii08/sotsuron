Saturday Night Fever," One of the most entertaining movies ever!
","Saturday Night Fever has everything! It's funny, serious and entertaining. The dancing is wonderful. Catch the Fever!",7,0,1,8 March 1999
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Great romantic comedy, the best I've seen in a while!
",There are no words to describe this movie. I found it hillarious and heartwarming. The two principle actors were great as their roles as Ben and Andie. Kate Hudson was great at driving Ben nuts. I laughed for days.I loved the soundtrack too. It had classics and modern day classics.I feel this movie will go down as a classic with such films as Pretty Woman and Dirty Dancing.,7,40,54,19 February 2003
Final Destination 2," Much Gorier...
","Although I enjoyed this movie, I must say the first one is much better. It did what few movies do which is concentrate on scares instead of gore, blood and guts. Although the acting was good in this movie, I still have to ask why do they always make sequels to horror films? I can only think of one that doesn't have a sequel and that is The Shining. I reccomend this movie if you have time to kill.",4,0,0,19 February 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," Absolutely Hilarious
","Absolutely one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time! Renee did a great job in her role. She played her so perfectly and even gained 25 extra pounds. I liked Bridget's alcoholic, single, workaholic craziness and how we basically got to go inside her head and really discover what she was thinking. Other movies such as 'City of Angels' and 'What Women Want' have tried to go inside women's thoughts and have not really suceded. 'Bridget Jones Diary' will become a classic like Pretty Woman. I can predict it already",Null,0,0,3 June 2001
American Pie," Awesome Movie!
","From the moment I saw the trailer for 'American Pie' I knew it would become a hit. When I saw it back in July 1999, I thought it was hilarious. Although I had seen 'There's something about Mary' I wasn't used to the new trend of gross out comedies. After seeing American Pie I left the theater laughing for days. This movie tops the list of gross out comedies and no one should go without seeing it. It will offend and charm you. It's the 'Porky's' of the 1990s",Null,0,0,13 August 2001
Coyote Ugly," Falsely Advertised
","What a shocker! Coyote Ugly was a great movie! Looking at the commercials I was expecting a PG-13 version of 'Showgirls'. Instead, I saw a young dreamer fight to meet her goals and learn how tough the world can be. I was surprised at how much of a 'coming of age' movie this was. A fresh, young, hot, new group of actors and an amazing soundtrack add to this movie's greatness.",Null,1,1,3 June 2001
8 Mile," A Two Hour Music Video
","I guess this film is for die hard Eminem fans only. I mean, I had to sit through two hours of rap! I don't know why this movie was critically acclaimed. It is purely a popularity contest of the biggest rapper of today and the target audience. What really bothers me about this movie is how screwed up Lilly should be/will become and no one cares. I mean the kid watched her mother, brother and her mother's boyfriend get beaten up. Not to mention the drugs and language that is around this kid! Where is social services when you need them? Not as great as described! A big letdown in fact!",5,0,1,29 March 2003
"Girl, Interrupted"," Great Movie!
","Susanna Kayson tries to kill herself with Vodka and Asprin. She is sent to a mental ward where her she is forced to take medication she doesn't need, her roomate is obssesed with The Wizard of Oz and She is attacked by Lisa within her first moments. Eventually Lisa becomes her savior. She teaches her to live. Things begin to look down for Susanna. She is banned from Lisa for 'innapropriate behavior', Her friend gets out and Her boyfriend is sent to war. The nurse has the answer 'Get yourself out'. The acting in this movie is superb. Angelina Jolie was awsome!",7,1,2,1 April 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Unwatchable Crap
","This movie is pure junk. It was recomended to because of my love of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'. It might be because I'm only 15 years old but I do know a bad movie when I see one. When Seperates this from other movies about rapist psychos is that there is no point to this movie. I do enjoy Psycho movies like 'The Shining', 'Psycho' and  'Scream' But this one is just plain stupid. How could this of been nominated for best movie? The oscars have a horrible way of picking  the best movies and they still need to shape up. In my opion 'Clockwork Orange' should be nominated for worst movie at the razzies. 1/10",6,3,10,17 April 1999
Scream 2," They tried to hard...
","Not only was this film rushed into production after the original was such a huge success but they tried too hard to make it scarier, funnier and better. Watching this movie I see the references, the humour and the characters I grew to love from the original. But, there is something really important missing. A NEW PLOT. Sidney is scared, she's a loner, she has a past, something bad happened to her. We've seen this all before. Gail is just as tough and rude as she always was. Randy's a geek, Dewey's a geek, and there's a whole new group of whiners. The killer is predictable, and once again, a repeat of the original.",Null,0,0,12 July 2001
Scream," funky, scary, sexy, cool
","Just when you thought the horror genre was dead and buried Wes Craven released Scream in the mid 1990's and it was the surprise smash hit of most horror films of all time! Sitting down to watch this, after the first scene I was freaked. Every movie has it's one famous moment and Drew Barrymore's scene has gone down in history as one of the scariest moments of all time. The rest of the movie (although scary at times) is really comic relief. An enjoyable little film which has reopened us to a new kind of horror and has made it's cast stars. The film carries many spoofs and references to classic horror films and has repopularized them. Scream will remain with me as *the* film of my teenage years",Null,0,0,12 July 2001
Halloween," Awesome movie
","Halloween is an excellent movie. It's a great horror/Slasher movie. Jamie Lee Curtis rules in her first. Great, Great movie! Although it could be a lot scarier. A must for horror fans.",Null,0,1,23 February 1999
Back to the Future Part II," Great sequel! An Under rated Classic!
","In very few cases can a sequel hold the same magic as the first one. In Back to the Future part 2, the film makers are able to not only introduce new and exciting adventures for these characters that have grown dear to our hearts but also, review events of the first film and do an amazing job.I loved this movie just as much as the original and highly recommend it for the entire family.",Null,0,0,26 February 2003
Carrie," Scarier in 1976
","My mom always warned me that I'd never sleep again if I watched this movie. When I was 12 I watched it and I thought 'What is the big deal?' The whole thing was a joke until the prom.  It wasn't a horror movie, It was a drama. This being 1999 times have changed and movies have changed a lot. Look at Psycho, That was considered the biggest shocker of all time, The remake came and young people wanted to watch the original and found it dumb. The same thing is happening with Carrie. With everyone talking about the hand at the end, how can you be shocked when you known what's going to happen?   Carrie is not a bad movie.   It shows how cruel kids could be .",Null,0,0,4 April 1999
Any Given Sunday," Makes ya sick to your stomach
",A horrible movie that's humor sucks. It's length is way too long and moves way too fast. One second she could be scratching her head and the next she'll be opening a door. It makes you sick. I actually had to put my head between my knees. Skip this one.,Null,0,0,1 April 2000
Final Destination," Finally! A really great Horror Film!
","I saw this movie last night and whoa what a surprise! Alex (Devon Sawa) has a vision that the plane carrying 40 students and four teachers will crash. He puts up a fuss on the plane and Carter(Kerr Smith) trys to beat him up. Eventually Alex, Carter, Alex's two friends, Carter's girlfriend, A teacher and Clear a girl who believes Alex are removed from the plane.  The Plane crashes and Death  has skipped these seven people. But, Death comes back for them, trying to kill them one by one. This film is surprising, terrifying and just down right cool.",7,0,0,1 April 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The best horror film
","Nightmare on Elm street is a great movie. It's scary, funny and very entertaining. Best out of the series. Freddy scares the heck out of you!",7,0,0,23 February 1999
Back to the Future," Absolutely Amazing
","I can't believe I waited this long to watch the trilogy. I'm so glad I did. This movie amazes me and makes me laugh every single time. This is truly a classic. Michael J. Fox was riding high at this point in his life with the popularity of 'Family Ties', this film at #1 on the box office and his 'Teen Wolf' at #2. The acting was great, the music and score were awesome. This is a great film that deserves recognition as one of the greatest.",Null,0,1,19 February 2003
