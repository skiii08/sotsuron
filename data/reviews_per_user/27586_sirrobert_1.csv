The Ring," Pretty good movie. Not really scary, just a bit creepy.
","I heard quite a few people make comments such as 'this is the scariest movie ever!' I rented it with a friend. It wasn't actually very 'scary,' it was more 'creepy' and the ideas were more 'cool' than anything else.If you're looking for scary stuff, that is the realm of horror stories and the macabre, the king (obviously) is H.P. Lovecraft. His take on the matter is summarized by this line of his: 'The oldest and greatest emotion of man is fear; and the oldest and greatest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.' The Ring (and other modern 'horror' movies) could take a bit of a lesson from that. Don't show everything. Let the mechanisms be implicit (not missing, but not explicit either). That's part of why Hitchcock was so successful at what he did ('The Birds,' etc.).Anyway, It's worth a rent if you've never seen it.",7,0,2,7 February 2006
