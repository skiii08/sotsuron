Black Swan," If you hated it, it's probably because you didn't understand it ...
","... and that's by design.The central theme of this film is so disturbing and distasteful that it had to be communicated in the most subtle and subdued way. It had to be this way to avoid the box office-killing NC-17 rating, and also to keep scores of people from being disgusted and turned off. Darren Aronofsky, known for his blunt style, had to resort to this extreme subtlety out of necessity, and the result is a film that is brilliant.Now that you've had enough time to stop reading before hitting a spoiler, here is the bottom line. This film is about an obsessive-compulsive young woman slowly losing her mind. The reason: her sexually abusive mother. That's it. The incestuous relationship is only hinted at various points in the film. I noticed four, although there may be more: 1) When the mother gets Nina to lick the frosting off her finger, 2) When the mother tells Nina to take off her shirt and she yells 'no', suggesting that getting undressed at her mother's command was not an unusual occurrence, 3) When Nina jumps into bed moments before the mother comes into the room asking 'are you ready for me?' (this one's a dead give-away -- what else can it mean?), and 4) Spout's theory that '... coming home, still high from rolling, Nina's mom accosts her in her state and has sex with her. However because of her state, Nina is more responsive than usual because she is imagining that she is with Lily (it is later revealed that Lily never came home with Nina). That's why the shot of the mom on top of Nina is one of the mom smiling before she continues oral sex with Nina.' In ballet, Nina has found refuge from this horrific existence, which explains her obsession with her art. In the end, she cracks up from the inside, and this is what we get to witness from her point of view.",8,1,4,3 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," What more do you want??
","When you look back at the original trilogy, you notice that Star Wars has never tried to be more than it was meant to be: old-fashioned, cornball, Saturday afternoon matinÃ©e stuff except with state of the art visuals, sound, costumes, music, as well as a decisively epic feel. That's what made it special. That's why in '77, while SW was on its way to becoming the biggest money-maker in Hollywood history, the best picture Oscar went to Annie Hall. Star Wars was never meant to be serious. In Lucas' words, its true purpose is to appeal 'to the kid' - not the film critic - 'in all of us'.It seems that in the 16 years between the two trilogies, expectations had developed that the upcoming first three episodes would all be legitimate contenders for Best Picture honors. Such was the expectation for The Phantom Menace, which helps explain the tremendous disappointment that was caused by its uninteresting plot and uncharismatic cast of characters. The problem was with the expectations, not the movie. I feel that, after all six episodes are released, TPM will be seen as the legitimate introductory chapter in a six-volume set, the second half of which has already been unveiled.As for the Attack of the Clones, I agree that the acting is at best average, but this is the case with ALL Star Wars films! Why should AOTC be any different? If it were, it wouldn't fit in! Yes, the dialog sounds forced and unnatural. But go back to the first trilogy and notice the dichotomy in dialog style between the younger characters (Luke, Leia, Han, young rebels) and the older ones (Ben, Vader, Tarkin, Yoda, the emperor). The old ones talked EXACTLY the way they do in the episodes I and II!! This is no accident. The talking style is a GENERATIONAL factor, reflective of a highly refined and cultured era that goes down the tube with the fall of the Republic, resulting in a less refined younger generation that talks more the way we do!What I did see in AOTC was a smooth and well-handled transition from the mundane and childish earlier world of TPM to the upcoming more sombre world of the first trilogy. This movie had everything that can be legitimately expected from a Star Wars film: a simple but powerful story, told against a backdrop of a grand and wonderous alien universe, and seen from the point of view of characters that, regardless of their chronological ages, are basically kids at heart. Don't evaluate any of these film on its own merits. If you find any, it just means you got lucky. Lucas is making a set, and we have so far seen five of the six pieces. The true judgement will lie with a future generation that will see all six episodes at once, for the first time, in numerical order.For the die-hard fans out there: I hate to break it to you, but Lucas is making these movies for your kids!",Null,0,0,8 June 2002
The Number 23," Wasted Potential
","This shouldn't be a spoiler, but I'll be very careful anyway. Go ahead and read.You don't get the basic premise of the story until the very end. And when you do, it's actually pretty cool. Hitchcock, or some other director who is above resorting to unnecessary schlock, could have made a fascinating mystery thriller out of this. But Mr. Schumacher goes for hokey sensationalism when he doesn't really need to.Here is the disappointment: The number 23 has nothing to do with this story and is introduced for purely dramatic effect.Too bad. This movie could have been so much better. Why do good directors bottom-feed? Is it just to cater to the 'target audience'?By the way, 2 divided by 3 equals .666666..., which rounds off to .667.",6,2,4,25 August 2007
Unknown," Major plot hole and cheesy politics tarnish an otherwise great effort
","Watching this movie was an unusual experience. I began by expecting it to be a long Twilight Zone episode. Then I was turned off by what seemed to be a contrived and overly artsy narrative, then I got confused. By the time I started coming out confusion, about three quarters into the movie, I was at the edge of my seat. And through it all, I was mesmerized by Diane Krueger.This is an ambitious movie that's trying to be an old-fashioned, hard-hitting, thought-provoking, espionage thriller. And it comes damn close to hitting its mark. Unfortunately, it falters on two key points.First, it is impossible to forge an identity as a university faculty. And it's even more impossible (?) to fake a university. The story loses all of its credibility on this point alone.Second, it all at the end gets reduced to a reactionary Hollywood left-wing piece of hysterical propaganda aimed at the evil Corporate America. Enough already! This director has a real talent for bringing out the charisma in his actors. Diane Krueger and Bruno Ganz stood out for me, but I was impressed with everyone's performance. They were all natural, believable, and likable.At the very least, I hope this kicks off a trend in Hollywood that will replace this silly infatuation with sequels, remakes, and reboots.Thanks for the attempt.",7,1,3,3 July 2011
Mulholland Drive," Any theories on the dog turd??? Seriously!!
","Thanks for all of the explanations. All well and good.But what's supposed to be the significance of the dog turd on the apartment grounds in Diane's dream. I mean, there is an isolated shot of it and everything. It's got to mean SOMETHING!Any ideas???",Null,0,0,15 June 2003
Mulholland Drive," This isn't art; it's porn.
","Like many people, I spent many days going over this film in my head in an attempt to piece the story together.  I even sat through a second screening. My expectation was that my efforts and expense would be rewarded by a stunning revelation not unlike the ones at the end of genuine thrillers such as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and The Others.  When the story finally did make sense to me, all I could think was: 'SO WHAT?!!! WHO GIVES A S__T?!!!'I suppose the true worth of a movie is in its entertainment value, and Mulholland Drive has obviously entertained many.  But so has the porn industry.  If I am going to spend time thinking about a movie for a long time and even see it a second time, I'd much rather do it because the story was powerful, not confusing.  The thrill exists only so long as there are questions.  Once they are answered, the fear factor is gone and all that remains is a ridiculous feeling stemming from wasted time and energy.It cannot even be argued that the value of the film was not so much in the story as in how it was told.  Look, if the purpose was to get the audience to see life from the point of view of the protagonist, then complicating things only defeats this purpose.  How can you identify with a character if you don't know what the hell is going on???I can see why the Disney-owned ABC network rejected this beautiful-looking piece of pornography.",Null,0,1,23 June 2002
Mulholland Drive," But what about the dog turd?

Paranormal Activity," The only scary thing about this movie is the stupidity of its characters ...
","... and that of the audience that buys into it.A little over a decade ago, as Hollywood blockbuster budgets were getting blown out of control, many of us predicted that someone was going to pick up a camcorder and create a blockbuster at a shoe string budget. Shortly afterward, we witnessed a misfire (The Last Broadcast), and a bull's-eye (The Blair Witch Project). The genius of the latter was not only in its simplicity but also its believability. The paranormal connection was left open to debate. It was a clever little film.Not so with Paranormal Activity which insults its audience's intelligence and apparently manages to get away with it. Roger Ebert's 3.5-star rating of this movie is testament to the old man going senile. Real terror is the result of identifying with characters who make the same decisions that we would under similar circumstances. What can you say about an audience that actually identifies with the endless string of bone-headed and utterly idiotic mis-steps of the two main characters, as well as the contrived and highly questionable plot-moving claims of the 'expert', such as 'leaving the house will not help at all'? Oh yeah? Then how about calling 911? Or sleeping in another room? Or taking shifts sleeping? Or just staying the hell awake one friggin' night?! Or just going some place where there are a lot of people instead of insisting on being cooped up inside the house? ....It's been almost four decades since The Exorcist, and this is the state of the sensibilities of the modern moviegoer? In the distant future portrayed in the film Idiocracy, a blockbuster is a movie called simply 'Ass', which consists of 90 minutes of a man's butt making a variety of noises. We are not quite there yet, but seem to be well on the way!",3,4,7,7 February 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," Intelligent psychodrama -- perhaps unintentionally!
","There is plenty of evidence supporting the claim that this movie is a misfire: a feeble attempt to be science fiction and a love story at the same time, and failing on both fronts. But I think that from a different perspective, it is actually a smart and thought-provoking little film -- although Nolfi might not have intended it that way!In spite of its good acting and engaging chemistry between Damon and Blunt, I did not enjoy watching this film. It made me angry, because I kept thinking that the Adjustment Bureau, as an entity, was far more important and pressing than being obsessed with a girl that one has met in the bathroom and has spent a grand total of 7 minutes with -- no matter how beautiful or charismatic she may be. When faced with the awe and grandeur of a superhuman presence who has steered the course of human civilization, all other mundane concerns shrink into insignificance. The fact that David Norris didn't get this simple concept showed me just how contrived and dishonest this movie was. I was ready to walk out in the middle of it.What kept me watching it though was the possibility that this was precisely Nolfi's point. Here is a young man destined to assume a position of great leadership, and yet his life is marked by an endless stream of poor judgments and bone-headed decisions. From the fraternity prank, to kissing a strange girl he just met in the bathroom after losing a big election, to his senseless obsession with her, to his lack of curiosity about the greater notion of an Adjustment Bureaus, to hitting an elderly gentleman in the hospital waiting room ... This guy simply was not playing with a full deck. He was unbalanced, irrational, compulsive, and generally not very bright, and apparently not at all curious. Who wants to have someone like that in the White House anyway?! At the end, he gets the girl, and we get to breathe a collective sigh of relief that his life has been shifted away from the Presidency, and the danger has been averted! I am giving George Nolfi a lot of credit here with this interpretation. I hope I'm right. If not, the guy is just an awful writer.",6,1,2,26 June 2011
Jaws," Rescored Music on Laserdisc
","A decade ago, before the DVD era, I was at a video store where I noticed, on the back cover of a JAWS laserdisc, the message 'Some Music Rescored'. Later, I found that due to some copyright issues, some music on this edition of the LD had indeed changed.  Since then, I have been wondering what part of the music this was.A few days ago, I finally broke down and bought a cheap copy of this edition of the LD from ebay.  I played back every part of the movie that I knew had background music, and did not notice anything different from the version that has existed for the past 28 years.What is this new rescored music, and where in the movie is it?  If you know the answer, I would appreciate a reply.  This is bugging me!Thanks in advance.",Null,0,1,7 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It's time for Star Wars to dare to be more -- again
","What made Star Wars Star Wars? For those of us old enough to remember, it was fresh; it was bold; it was DIFFERENT. Although it had its roots in ancient myth, matinée serials, and westerns, it dared to go against the grain of the cynical and hyper-realistic face of American cinema in the 1970s and usher in a new era of energy, optimism, and imagination, fueled by never-before-seen technology, visual and sound effects, and unprecedented use of a lush and brilliant symphonic score.So I ask you: how many of these elements are present in TFA? Without giving too much away (I'm not putting a spoiler warning on this), very little if any. Star Wars was the product of the creative mind of a young George Lucas who was not afraid to rock the boat. TFA is the work of a nervous and not-so-daring J. J. Abrams who was under enormous pressure to use tried and true formulas to give Disney maximum return on its investment. There is no comparison.Lucas and Spielberg both began their careers as avant garde visionaries before becoming isolated from the mainstream mindset in their towering empires. Abrams is nothing more than a gifted fan boy who revels at mimicking and one-upping the masters, with absolutely no original idea or vision of his own. He was given this assignment simply because the Disney brass considered him a safe bet after the disappointment of the prequels caused by the aforementioned isolation of George Lucas from the mainstream. Unlike Lucas and Spielberg who had a story to tell in their youth, Abrams does not care about the story, so long as it is told very loudly. He is NOT the real deal, and neither is his work.I am somewhat optimistic about Episode VIII knowing that it is in the hands of Rian Johnson. I'm not sure he will be any better than Abrams, but he will likely be different, and this case, different is good.Meanwhile, enjoy this recent product which, like The Phantom Menace, will go on to set box office records before being harshly judged by history.",5,2,7,27 December 2015
