10 Cloverfield Lane," A surprisingly well developed and tense film.
","I initially had no interest in seeing this film, I never saw the original Cloverfield film, and I wouldn't want to waste my time on a generic sci-fi film. Therefore, I never saw this film in 2016.A year later and I see this film pop-up in many Top 10 lists, and I decide to give this film a chance after I heard that the film was actually good and didn't follow the story of Cloverfield. I was immediately surprised by the certificate given to the film; I expected the film to be a 15. Therefore, I knew that this film would be tame.However, immediately after watching this film I can safely say that 10 Cloverfield Lane is the most brutal and tense 12 rated film I've ever seen. Although most importantly, 10 Cloverfield Lane is the most well-made and tense film I've seen this year.The films' quality is ensured from the well developed characters and style. The film always places the perspective on Michelle, this is conveyed through the use of tense atmosphere and delivery that perfectly reflects our main characters' emotions.The most important factor that ensured the quality of this film, was the character development and story. Instead of shoving a narrative down your throat through exposition, the film instead decides to play out naturally as you progressively map out the story in your head.The film always catches you off-guard, this is due to the character development, this benefits the audience as they route for the characters, as they're given a reason to care.The film uses sound and visuals to emphasise an impression of a character, however the film constantly flips your expectations. At first the film presents Harold negatively through the viewers expectations, however we soon change our opinion due to his devotion to ensuring safety. As an audience member you're against Michelle, although if you apply the information you've learnt later in the film you'll realise that the expectations you had at the beginning were right all along.There are unfortunately a few problems holding this film back from being an excellent film. Despite the developed nature of the film, unfortunately 10 Cloverfield Lane devolves into the typical sci-fi alien action seen in many films, however what makes this segment forgiving is the realistic and serious tone.I'd also like to point out that this film was surprisingly tense and shocking, especially for a 12 rated film, you see a man being broken down in acid, and a mentally insane woman deteriorating. All of which I expected in a 15 rated film.Another problem is some of the decisions made by the characters, while the characters are human, some of there actions are a bit unjustified. No-one would immediately breathe in the air without precautions, despite this for the most part all seemingly dumb decisions are all answered with a reasonable excuse. One example of this is that Michelle constantly demands reminders for information she already knows this is explained due to the head wound.Other problems are from the standard movie-making clichés. The film has a lot of moments that are unlikely to occur in reality, although the film also has a cliché sequel bate ending. This annoys me deeply as the fact that a studio wants more money is very apparent.Nonetheless, this is now one of my top favourites of 2016, and I'm glad I saw 10 Cloverfield Lane. 8/10",8,0,0,17 June 2017
Hereditary," The First Spark of 2018
","I think that we can all agree that 2018 has been a lukewarm year for films, it seems like we've had almost any entire year of nothing but cash grabs and historical dramas while most of the true classics are yet to be discovered. Thankfully, this year is starting to shine with Hereditary.Hereditary seems to be part of a bach in the growing amount of slow burners, and as of right now all of these burners have been great. Last year we received the masterpiece It Comes at Night, and the year before we received yet another masterpiece The Witch.However in-comparison to those films, Hereditary is the first film out of the bunch which has scared me relentlessly. But not just that, the film had me shaking and breathing heavily throughout while the film teased me with the potential shocker.
This film is excellent at subverting your expectations just like The Witch and It Comes at Night. There are many instances where the film displays a large window or a mirror right next to a character to tease you into believing that a potential jumpscare may spring, however instead of giving into this cliche, the film utilises this expectation to prolong its brooding tension, further brought to life by its equally brooding soundtrack and pacing.However, this film doesn't get a free pass for simply scaring me, this fear works due to its developed characters, most of whom are responsible for the evoked tension. The performance by Toni Collette is simply stunning, she authentically portrays her character while fleshing out some of the more perturbing personality features that manifest later in the film.I didn't really have a problem with any other performance except for a few spots of Alex Wolff's performance, for the most part he solidified the authenticity although in a few noticeable occasions he inaccurately portrayed some of the intended emotions which lead to a little bit of unintentional amusement.As well as my mixed thoughts on Alex Wolff's performance, I found that the pacing and the tension didn't entirely work to the film's advantage. Due to the fact that the tension for the film started building up from 10 minutes onwards, there were many occasions where I became de-sensitised and a little unengaged to the film due to the fact that the tension stood still for a while. This may seem trivial, although it was a feeling that detracted a tiny bit of my care from the film.Despite having stated that, this film is right near the top of my list of films released in 2018, there are many shot decisions and stylistic choices that have likely inspired my craft.One of my favourite shots from the film is the one in which Charlie sees her grandmother standing amidst a fire. The shot evokes a real eerie vibe due to the fact that it juxtaposes the reality of the film. In terms of my favourite stylistic decision I loved the films' quick contrast between the perspective of Nat Wolfe's character and the main actress, another is the films' depiction of the spirits, they manifest a sleep paralysis quality which further enables them to evoke tension due to the personal resonance.As I'm certain, most have discussed the subtle details listed in this film, and due to my love, I feel motivated to watch the film again to see details which I didn't catch the first time round.For a debut film, Aster should be extremely proud of his achievements, and I hope that this praise will motivate you to expand upon your capabilities and confidence.",8,1,4,18 June 2018
The Mist," A terrible Hollywood movie saved by its ending
","The novella had been noted numerous times when discussing the inspiration for many titles in the industry, I had no interest in watching this film until many regarded this film to have the most depressing/disturbing ending.Being one who finds interest in being disturbed/depressed, I was intrigued to watch this film.The film displayed its quality through its cinematography and camera-work, which was very note-worthy. However, this aspect diminishes as the first act ends.The first issue I noticed was the acting and casting choices, I'm fed up with big Hollywood films always choosing the 'hottest' actors to play the most mundane roles. And that proved to be a great offender for this film.The acting for the majority of the film is terrible, the only exception being Toby Jones's performance which fit his role. Every actor didn't display much emotion in their face especially when in the most deepest emotions a human could be.The visuals are very bland, the typical Horror colours are utilised. Although the biggest drawback to this aspect are the CGI effects, which aren't convincing and look abysmal. Some of the CGI effects don't include any lighting to blend the CGI in with the environment, leaving the effects to appear non-existent in the scene.There are a few practical effects that look convincing, however they're barely in the film, and become very noticeable due to the terrible contrast between the CGI and practical effects.The biggest offender to me is the script, the characters have barely any character development, so your investment and care in them are nearly non-existent. In addition to this, these characters make the most inhuman decisions they could possibly make in the context the film displays to us.All of these aspects helped create a dumb Hollywood film that was unintentionally entertaining, the dumb decisions and actions that took place in these scenarios made the film hilarious and annoyingly dumb. The stale, unrealistic, and synthetic acting ensured hilarity in the scenes that attempted relate-ability and emotion.However, despite the overwhelming amount of problems the film redeems some of its problems with its twist ending, the music and tone is perfect for the situation. The ending was what saved this film from being an unintentionally hilarious Hollywood horror.",6,1,1,5 September 2017
