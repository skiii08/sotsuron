Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Could have been better, but still very good
","Okey, now TPM may not be the best of the Star Wars series, but still offers rare treats to both old and new fans. The DVD is especially good, with its extras, and nice to watch on a quiet, rainy Sunday.The story goes like this:The greedy Trade Federation has decided to show off their trading skills and invade a lush planet Naboo and harrass the inhabitants, and the snooty Queen Amidala. Two Jedi - Qui Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi - are hired to settle it with the Federation. But the negotiations fail due to their indentity being revealed much too soon by a nosey droid and all hell breaks loose on the spaceships. But our brave heros escape after battling droids and sneak aboard a ship that flies to Naboo where they reunite, thanks to the help of a clumsy Gungan called Jar Jar Binks.I could go on and on, but you all know the story plot by now. I think the movie was perfect but one small problem... they should have really improved the script, and get the charactors to put more emotion in their voices and body language. I know Queen Amidala is supposed to be a cold person who responds softly, but even that she could have put more effort into it, so the future mother of Luke and Leia Skywalker wouldn't be so dislikable. But the costumes are great, I can tell you that!The DVD, as I mentioned before, is great and RECOMMENDED for any true Star Wars fan... this is my 2nd favourite Star Wars movie (next to 'Return of the Jedi')6/10 *four points lost due to wooden actingBye",Null,2,4,20 December 2003
