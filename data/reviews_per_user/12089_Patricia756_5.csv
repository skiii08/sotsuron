Skyfall," Please someone tell the producers to quit the doom and gloom and get entertaining again
","I don't want to watch a James Bond movie and get depressed, does anybody? He is old, and frail, M dies, what is this? A flop. The idea of James Bond worked for years and years simply because you could, not always but at times, count on great entertainment, great action, on a stunning charming sexy elegant perfect man that never fails, that knows everything, that can get any woman on the planet, that makes you smile with his cheesy/ cheeky sense of humor, that what women want to see and guys want beautiful women and amazing gadgets. Fun, fun fun. James Bond should be entertainment not drama. Can please someone tell the producers to quit the doom and gloom and go back to the unreal fabulous world James Bond is leaving into and embrace it once and for all, the more unreal the better. Please, do the audiences across the world a favor, get rid of Daniel Craig and get a real gorgeous man, beautiful to look at, tall and sexy as Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnam were, no raggedy, bulky, wrinkly man, James Bond is not a mine worker or a builder and get a sophisticated, G-O-R-G-E-O-U-S, beautiful to look at, a traffic stopper, with a cheeky look, someone you really can believe he can have every woman on earth. Do you need examples? Gerad Buttler, Ewan McGregor, Henry Cavill, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, just few names of possible but certainly believable drop dead gorgeous James Bond. Please don't try ever again to make James Bond ' more real, more human'. You cannot make him real, he is not supposed to be real!!! He should be everything we cannot possibly be, that is the fun about it, he is a dream taken to the extreme, a rich, extravagant, excessive fantasy, a dream man that is so over the top perfect, that becomes non-threatening for men and a total unadulterated fantasy for women. That's entertainment. That's James Bond. If I want drama I'll go and seek it somewhere else, somewhere it doesn't taste uncomfortably wrong.",1,9,18,16 November 2013
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Very confusing
","I didn't read the book nor watched the television series, I saw this film on television, twice, because on Sky it is shown fist in the evening and then the next day at lunch time. The first time I watch it in English and because I was utterly shocked I couldn't quite get it, I am not unintelligent or uneducated, I usually have no problem, I watch it the next day in Italian my mother tongue language to make sure that I wouldn't miss even a single comma and still I couldn't get it. For the first time in my life I was very confused on what was going on. The flashbacks in time where confusing to say the list, a couple of characters were looking alike so you didn't quite get who was who, a guy was dead ...no it wasn't, you think is a flashback, no it isn't the guy isn't dead, the characters were too many and their appearance on the screen too sporadically placed , it was very difficult to understand and remember who was that one and how relates to the others. I am sorry but you can do a film only for the people that read the book or watched the television series, really!!! Watch it only if you are a buff of this particular book and of this specific television series showing only in one country.otherwise it is compulsory to feel thick.",5,2,3,24 November 2012
Inside Man," Intelligent, slick, entertaining
","Mr Spike Lee never disappoints perhaps because he isn't in the business of making masterpieces, films to be put high up in the history of cinema; jet he will certainly be remember for the guy that made so many good, real, solid, well directed, recognizably personal, entertaining, moving, engaging films and wasn't rightfully appreciated by the Hollywood establishment. He stays true to himself and even when he is more 'commercial' he does it with cleverness and style. That why I like him and I will keep going to watch his films: he has never missed, not ones and I don't think he ever will, he is much too clever to make a mediocre film.",7,1,2,30 April 2006
Footloose," Remake mistake
","The original Footloose was a little film with a debatable script and a little budget. But contrary to all expectations was quite successful across the globe and became with time a cult movie and that thanks to the infectious music, dance routines quite impressive for the time, but most of all to a brilliant casting, believable and very suitable to their roles. Same thing that happened to Dirty Dancing. So take the original cast, the music and the novelty of the dance routines away from the equation and what is left is a very forgettable film with very unmemorable music, very ordinary dance routine and with a cast that makes you miss the old one every step of the way. Who was the guy playing the main role? I can't even remember his face that much mediocre he was and what about the leading lady, with no depth what so ever, painfully bad actors both with no chemistry between them. Do we need to equal the tension between the unassuming sex appeal of Kevin Bacon in that role and the irresistibly attractive vulnerability brought to the role by Lori Singer? Was it a not intentional carrier suicide taking up roles that are so vividly embedded in people memories? Was it? Well, I feel I need to mention, the countryman friend role, that in the original was so adorably played by Chris Penn, the guy who played the same part is such a poor takeoff, a caricature and his girlfrienda bubbly full of energy Sara Jessica Parker against a very dull actress there to fill space and nothing more. Even the original father and mother role (the preacher and his wife) were far more engaging at the point that you could see their point of view and sympathize, the original roles were played by John Lithgow and Dianne Weist, (believable even as a loving couple) in this new version played by Dennis Quaid and Andy MacDowell , that I usually really like, here they fell flat unable to be convincing in their role as troubled preacher and over concern but very tender and caring father and as the effectual moderator, sweet but strong mother as it was in the original. I'm sorry but would this film be an original it could be only regarded as a mediocre film, being a remake of a little delightful cult film is a very sorry version, terrible, not recommended unless you watch it on television and want something boring to doze off.",1,19,23,20 November 2012
Inside Llewyn Davis," So what?
","I love the Coen Brothers films, I've seen them all, I love films about people stories...usually I love them, I didn't this time. This time I didn't get it, at all. A very bad week of a looser. So? I had worse weeks in my life than this guy, believe me, do I think those weeks are worth doing a movie about it? No I don't, not really. Yet more, what about the abrupt ending? It plunges the whole film into 'ineffectual story'. I was so looking forward to see this film and I was so very disappointed that, when the film ended I had a moment of serious disbelieve and perplexity. What was the point of this film? Would somebody please enlighten me. The Coens' style is there, but there is nothing else worth watching. Sometimes the ordinary/extraordinary everyday life makes good stories to tell, not this time, nothing interesting in this film to communicate, nothing interesting to watch. In my opinion the worse film the Coen Brothers made, by far and I've been kind because I love them. OK, one bad slip, nothing serious.",5,2,3,10 February 2014
