Requiem for a Dream," Great but truly shocking
","I loved it, because it starts all so nice and almost funny and it makes you realize how much fun drug-taking can be to start with, but then the bitter truth follows and it shockingly shows, where it can lead you. It was a very touching movie, that made me cry in the end. It shows that anyone can fall to an addiction of some kind and end up with their lives shattered into pieces. The style of filming was absolutely amazing and quite different, the way they put small scenes of drug taking in, followed by diluted pupils.I give this movie a 10 out of 10. A definitely must see, but not everyone's cup of tea!!",10,0,1,7 December 2004
