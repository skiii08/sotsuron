Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," As good as the original Star Wars
","From the reviews I'd seen I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the original, but it was. It still had that feel of the original Star Wars. The great thing about the original films so not the acting, with this film having better a better standard of acting (exception of Alec Guinness). The Best part of the original movies is wonderful universe that is created, and the human part of the film, with the greatest power in the universe being the force and not any mechanical construction. The Phantom Menace is called by the critics as  just a special effects movie, I don't agree with this. I think the best thing about this film is the interaction between the characters, and seeing glimpse of the way the characters turn out. The only real weakness is , as the critics have said is the other use of computer generated characters, and not as much on the human characters. But overall it met my expectations and can't wait for  episode 2",10,0,0,4 June 1999
