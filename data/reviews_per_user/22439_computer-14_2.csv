Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," it's not fair
","When i heard about the movie i thought that i would laugh a lotwhat a pity and what a waste of time. Don't care about the votes of this movie . I like kazakh people and i like kazakhstan and also i am not an American fan but the man on the movie hates everything on this life except himself. when watching the movie i saw that he hates the Americans,he hates the gypsies on his mind every woman is whore , every man is stupid and the only person having the normal standarts is himself then i decide that the character on the movie is a great racist!! himself. And i didn't laugh at all then the movie finished i went home with a hard face it's sad to say but this movie is not funny.",2,8,15,7 February 2007
300," hey what was that
","what's happening , is there somebody out there who knows the true story of spartans. OK, OK let's assume that this is not a historical movie and say that this is a fantasy movie.even in this case it's not successful of making me believe that every spartan soldier has a body like the body builders, and it couldn't make me believe that no spartan soldier has any fur on their bodies, i say that they are all bright and shining :)they're all handsome and don't you realize that they're all good looking more than a wild raised soldier. then i continued to watch the movie and at the finishing sentences , i gave up fighting and started to laugh :) it looked like a little bit propaganda. then at the end of the movie i was sad of, the story is more valuable than we gave at this movie at all.",6,0,3,29 May 2007
