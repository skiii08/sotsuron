It," Best Horror movie since The Conjuring!
","'It' was utterly terrifying in every way! The new Pennywise is much more gruesome and demonic. I absolutely loved every single jump scare! The character choices were perfect and Bill did a brilliant job playing Pennywise. If you walk out of this movie unsatisfied, then I don't know what to say. I love the original IT but I believe this one now takes the cake! The fact that the developers made Pennyiwse's appearance that much more terrifying than the original, really boosted the overall greatness of the movie. It's creepy, disturbing,scary, and a genuine terror!",10,4,13,10 September 2017
A Quiet Place," An absolute must see!
","Woww I had no idea what kind of movie this was going to be. After reading the extensive plot, I figured that it would've been something completely different. I loved the whole not speaking element. It made the atmosphere so much more thrilling. The aliens looked great, no CGI to be found. They were terrifying. The setting being in one place didn't make the plot boring at all. In fact, one setting allowed the story to flow together easier instead of having to do several flashbacks and cut scenes to other places. The only glitch that I could really point out is that, there's no way that you would even think about being intimate with someone if you have to be that quiet. Any small noise attracts these things. Overall, this was such a great movie. It reinvigorated the movie scene and made a way for more unique movie genres to come!",8,1,2,21 April 2018
Alien: Covenant," Great Alien Addition
","Alien Covenant definitely surprised me as a the new installment to the Alien movies. I was genuinely unnerved and horrified by the time the first Xenomorph appeared!The creatures looked phenomenal and the cast did an excellent job at efficiently making the movie superb and a lot of questions that I had from Prometheus were finally answered. I'm glad I went to see the movie and it's so cool to see the alien series still going strong.Big props go to the developers, Ridley Scott, and the amazing cast that made it a wonderful addition to the alien Sci- Fi/thriller series. I'll definitely be patiently anticipating the next Alien!",8,27,51,20 May 2017
