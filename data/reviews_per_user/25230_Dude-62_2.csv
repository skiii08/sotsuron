Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Me-sa LOVE dis movie!!! (*spoilers*)
","I may have written about this movie before, but I don't think so.  This was quite simply an amazing movie.  To show you how little knowledge of Star Wars I had when I first saw it, I didn't realize that Anakin was Darth Vader- I figured he might have changed his name to Luke later on or something.  I know, I know;  Hey, i was tired.  The second time i saw it I had more of an idea of what was going on, and now I'm hooked.  I rented the other ones, loved them, and I wish i could speed up time to see the next two. How could you put down this masterpiece?  This has become my favorite movie ever.  The only down point is the acting in some parts, but the Queen isn't supposed to be like Leia, and I doubt that they were looking for Oscars with the acting anyway.  Jar Jar, poor Jar Jar:  people hate him, but i think he's awesome!  The Jedi knights are spectacular.  You get so absorbed into this world in the Star Wars movies.  Darth Maul, menacing, but not the menace, as lots of people think. My friends and I put 2 and 2 together and when we realized Sidious was Palpatine, it was like 'a-ha!' We were proud of ourselves when we stayed for the credits and Sidious wasn't listed.  The special effects- what can you say. Say what you will about Phantom Menace.  It made a fan out of me.",10,0,0,25 September 1999
There's Something About Mary," There's something about Cameron Diaz
","I had put off seeing this movie for a long time, but we finally rented it and I bought it within the next few days (a birthday present for my dad, but one of those that's a present to me, too!)  You can't help but go 'ouch' at the zipper scene, and Ben Stiller does a great job.  But like so many other guys, this movie made me fall in love with Cameron Diaz.  I can't wait for the next one!",10,0,0,25 September 1999
